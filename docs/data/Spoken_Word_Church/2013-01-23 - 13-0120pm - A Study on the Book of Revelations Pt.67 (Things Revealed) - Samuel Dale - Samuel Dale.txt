see amen and amen and amen and amen amen you want to see him the Bible said a child shall lead you so we see our children leading people to Jesus Christ amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord you like to turn in your scriptures turn back where we've been reading Revelations 1 in Revelations 8 I'm going to try to finish this up if we can again this afternoon and then I would just ask you to if you will to start reading like chapter 11 12 13 and on through that way you know and read them and just think about those things and we'll be trying to uh continue the thought on into those points like I said this morning remember that from the time of the RX Rapture you've only got like a 3 and 1/2 years tribulation period and then it turned only into going into uh opening up for the millennial Reign but you know there's a lot of scriptures in there of 11 12 and all through 13 and all that will uh you know take place during that period of time after the Rapture of the church so if you will study on that I don't know exactly how we'll go through it we may hit it fast we may hit it slow I really don't know which way so we will just wait and see how that we continue on but I want to try to conclude this part this afternoon about the seals and the things and then going into the things that are related in those those points amen so let's just pray father we thank you for grace and love unto us thank you for everything father that you've given unto us and we know you give them freely so then we don't have to work for nothing all we got to do is just relax and let you come on the scene as we try explain this morning about a revelation Lord then there's nothing we can do all we can do is make ourselves available unto you and then that way you can speak to our hearts and lives and Reveal Your word we love you and we thank you and just have your way now show us thy ways that we may walk there in and hold our hands lest we fail you and lead us by thy Grace father we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen revelation 1 we will never get off of Revelations 1 it gets the point till we finish the Book of Revelations we won't finish Revelations one all right 1 through 3 and the Revelation says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand okay Revelations 81 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've spent quite a time trying to express the things throughout the opening of the seals and the things that we've been uh considering and studying about and I pray that that it's helped you and trying to bring it kind of to a little conclusion into our hearts and lives this morning to talk about you know the silence in heaven and uh like I asked the question what would be the thing that would cause you to stand in all to me when the Plan of Redemption was made known In Heaven There in Revelations 5 by the opening of The Seven Seals then you know that Plan of Redemption to be handed down to Mankind and it would be if if those angels brother R said looking down here and seeing what's transpiring and they have seen these things unfold down through the the uh the word on the Book of Revelations and then they come to a place that they see something well could it be that they're looking down at Earth and seeing upon Earth the things that they have uh have uh you know witnessed and and looked at as far as the doings and the the lamb then coming forth to take the book and and doing those things and saying that he was worthy surely it would cause a an all and you know to happen into those people or those uh angels and cherubims and different things but then when we get back to it we will eventually see that actually that is you and I in chapter five that's right especially there where the Prophet would be dealing with it is always through four and five but he said this is actually the bride in heaven you remember the question they asked him and he answered and said no that's not the bride why because his mind was connecting with Revelations 4:1 going up and different things but then he sees that it is that he answered that question wrong so he went back and said that is the bride see in glory after the right all right then to for you and I it should make us stand today in awe of the thinking of the fact that you and I are the redeemed you and I have been redeemed we have a lamb that has taken the book that's right we've had a prophet to express the things to us to tell us what these things mean and you know the symbols and all and and that way we can understand The Book of Revelations and and see these things unfold where here right I am not much interested in what happening in heaven right I preached a long time ago probably 58 like 10 years ago a series called matching pieces and in that series I was trying to express that when when God SE here on Earth what he had in his mind before the world when we match exactly what he's showing in the Book of Revelations then we're going there I mean it ain't something that we may not or you know maybe we will uh it's made because that's us that's right going to be there there will be a time Revelations 5 will come into a reality amen of you and I being in heaven and all of the things and and when we get on over a little more you'll see the more as it opens up the the uh you know that Jesus when he resurrected sended on high and then he sat down on the father's Throne that's in chapter 5 right he sits down on the father's Throne he becomes the one on the throne he becomes the lamb he becomes the one with the book in his hand he becomes all things to to every bit of it and that'll fulfill the scriptures to where that we can see Amen in other words we're looking at a a a u preview you know but rather said Revelations CH 5 is not a verse by verse expressing but he said it's a scene for the opening of The Seven Seals all right then we see ourselves D already right why shouldn't it give us Rapture in faith you know I mean would you be worried if you could realize and see yourself sitting there as a you know around about the throne and and all of the things that's taking place and all of that represents you and I right and then we would be worried about whether or not we would make it right when we can see ourselves already there that's the beauty to me of the message of the hour that has brought to my understanding anyway is that I can be right here upon Earth in the most horrible existence of time that's ever been as far as perversion and perplexities and everything on every hand but yet at the same time I can look and say it's already finished I can read the back of the book I I know how it's going to end it ain't going to be a surprise to the bride we know how it'll end we know what is causing it to take place and whatever is going on we see that while we he so then that means somebody's going to make amen but the thing of it is it's not my name written there you know what I mean if it just say Samuel D written there you know and just a few you say well that's all it's going to make it no the bride's going to make it so it's not going to be this one name written there or something but we got to see ourselves there before we can go there there's the matching pieces I've tried to get you to see when Martin Luther came on the Earth now we'll get on over into a little more into this and later on in the the the Book of Revelations and studying it you know that those angels coming across there with that with the Everlasting gospel do you know who that was you were looking one of these days and this is I'll give you a key to to studying uh the things I've asked you to read especially say chapter 11 12 and going on you read it it looks like hideous things it look like all kind of animals and all kind of things and it's already taking place or is taking place well I just can't see them them great big hideous animals is coming across the Earth you know and then they get to describ it you know what it is 10th Street downtown Atlanta with a bunch of hippies years ago Bel long hair to torment the women for cutting their High that's what your Prophet said amen right you mean all of these things that we're going to read of could basically almost be fulfilled sir amen the moon turned to blood oh but one of these days it'll be a great this we'll probably get into the trumpets eventually if we can amen you know that WR around said six of those trumpets is already sounding read the trumpets and look at the horrible things that are under there and he said it's already taking place we see we're looking for something to happen when it's already finished amen that will be what we'll be trying to get to when we get off of this part here but now remember what we were saying this morning then the violence those people are actually or that situation is taking place to look down here but down here is the most important thing of all right because without this here there would not be that there right now don't try to turn it around cuz see you're going to try to turn it around and say it backwards you're going to say well that that D there wouldn't be this here you're going backwards that's right you'll never get nowhere going that way without this is happening on Earth there would never be that there so then we better depend upon what's here where does the Thunder s at on Earth the prophet said right watch it when we get over to the end of the message today and see how that the Lord himself descends from heaven with the sh right and we realize things is taking place yes right and see then through the opening of the seals and the things that's what I want you to think about this afternoon if I don't get nothing else across is the things that will be that we'll deal with that when the prophet saw it it had already happened in his ministry right amen he was no longer looking forward MH he was looking at right what was transpiring all right now there may be things that will transpire one day but still the basics of let's just get down to seeing what God has done and then by way of the Prophet remember there would be no need of him right I hope the Lord forgives me for this terminology cuz I'm caral this get to be anyway but there'd be no need of having a prophet if it wasn't a bride right absolutely this wouldn't be any need of it it wouldn't be need of a bride if it wasn't savior amen so it's all comes back to you and I the Book of Revelations is not something that shows great big old V that's what we talk boom boom boom something walking across the Earth you know my brother-in-law told me that the badst preacher you know he said oh they'll just be a great big animal I said Robert my Lord's got to be a religious matter you can't deceive nobody with a King Kong a great big whale washed up down there on the beach one day and I told my wife I said gu Roberts Glory Hallelujah he found the animal that come washing up out the ocean you know and all that I said I'm not throwing off we everyone was in that shake and still are until God does something for us you know we've all had our ideas and opinions and thoughts that's right but think about it the silence in heaven now get this for the message part A little later on I mentioned it this morning silence in heaven for space half hour all right now brother Brown you're going to tell us you're a revelation of it yes that's what I'm going to do I'm not going to speak I can't speak you know that even balum said there is no way I can say anything that's right unless God speaks to me first that's right a false prophet couldn't speak until God spoke that's what he said but you see a great silence in heaven okay now where you going brother Brandon to get a scripture he covers chapter 7 he said this is all we have to go on right well that was what I was saying this morning to get your thought in mind see cuz chapter 7 starts over telling you what happens under chapter 6 mhm chapter 8 chapter 9 chapter 10 tells you what happens under chapter 6 that's the scriptures the prophet was using the only thing he had to go on was the complete Plan of Redemption that would be completed through those two witnesses upon this Earth that will bring a situation into existence of purging until it'll even start a purging of the world and bringing that into a situation to where it will eventually turn out to have a future home right situation right amen and it go right into eternity I hope you were listening I want to rephrase it when God speaks to Your Heart by Revelation that is he eternal life when he spoke to you about one God water baptism no eternal hell a prophet sin Etc that Split Second that it was there is eternal life that's right right then you drop back to Earth and you start searching the things of the word right to see where everything is at when the prophet comes over and he says Lord what are we going to do it just says a silence yes silence and God opens the word yes and what would you be looking for if you were looking for silence in the word as we'll get to some of the dreams and the things that the prophet spoke of when he said see it slide right into the scriptures because he couldn't take anything that wasn't in the scriptures this is not that it's all made you know and then wind up to be something different or some some doings you know that's right it's to be the word amen God is to reveal himself to us through the word he was a word Prophet so when he did he knows immediately because of what's been going on during the week that's right he said it's not been a man said it's been the angels of the Lord amen you remember the Visions the dreams the different things that happened that he was to go to Tucson you know be found at a certain place and God would open up that those things to him he meet with the angels of the Lord he said this day this scripture is fulfilled he had met with those angels come forth that's right brought the message amen well he knew what was going on that week he said I wanted somebody to stand up and see it and say I see what's going on we get to it the minute of the great third pull he says this is that third pull he said you should have caught it the other day that's right well let's get into the things then and try to follow it by what of the Prophet because that's the only way we can go so when brother R sees silence in heaven he immediately reads yourself up he immediately dropped over so this is my revelation of it he said it's some seven Thunders that's right that John was forbidden to Rite well you know being forbidden to write would be a Sol now he's got scripture right Amen to go with the point oh a silence in heaven he's got a background of everything in chapter 7 cuz that's what he said this this is just a background for it what to show the complete Plan of Redemption so then he's going over and he's saying she look those things which the seven Thunders utter right them not but in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he the seventh Church age Messenger right John knows now Revelations 10 he knows now that he that he can see he's wondering how in the world I'm I'm commissioned to write all of this that's right I'm commissioned to tell you all of these things but how in the world am I going to get it back to down to people on Earth that's he knew that he could write the book yes but he knew better than to think that he would be able to live 2,000 years and delivering himself that's right you so he says what will I do that little butt is very beautiful there in in Revelations 10:7 you know how many times I've tried best to explain that to you he said but in the days of the voice and you right then that that seventh Church age messenger was a prophet right he saw it right there that that would be he brother around says Revelations 10:1 the angel standing with the rainbow about him he said is the same as Revelation 113 one in the midst of the seven golden candles stick like un the son of man G about the pouch with a golden girdle amen and he knows it's going to be on earth so he says all right now we've got it John said I know how to get it back all I got to do is just keep writing I don't have to go deliver it right I just keep writing cuz now the key has come for it that that seventh Church age messenger would be a prophet I don't spend my time trying to proved run around was a prophet God proved that I spend my time trying to get you to see where he's at in the word he had that that that biblical background he had he everything he had he laid it in the word amen he said if that angel tells me something that's not in the word he said I ain't going to take it because he's he was a prophet right if that angel didn't tell him the truth he said not the angel of the Lord but see then that seventh angel would be able to deliver Jo this going I'll finish writing the book now my word worries about getting it down because I want to TI a little point to you and let you think see in chapter 5 as we were studying this morning John is worried because it was nobody to take the book he rejoiced when he saw the lamb what do you think he done when he saw this angel in 107 what do you think John Da when he looks down and sees but there will be one on Earth that can bring this Revelation at the time clearly he's rejoicing to see those things now so then we're looking at it and seeing that what we have the ability now to hear from God yes that was part I had in the notes this morning the brothers know it I didn't bring it out cuz to me the Thunder the voice of God when the seal breaks amen right that's what your Prophet said it was I'm give you these over and over and over to where you can do paragraph 262 the first seal Thunders the voice of God when the seal broke but I'm asking you one question do we hear a voice from Heaven no are you listening yes or do we hear the voice of God from Heaven speaking by way of a prophet on Earth right now which one is it do we need to go to heaven to get this or do we need to just keep studying the message that's it because we're going to believe that this was the light Angel's message then we're going to have to believe to the Gentiles now put it correctly right cuz two prophets go to Israel that's right but to the Gentiles there's not another Prophet to come to bring us something we must depend upon what we already have well if we're dependent upon what we already have why is everybody looking for something else that's all I've ever asked any question I'm not don't throw off on these people for do it I've always said I'd rather see a man stumble and fall at least trying then to see the people is we don't we don't need to know them deep things we might get get confused so we just stay real simple now so we'll just do that and we'll just get together and we'll just play the tapes and that way we're hearing exactly the voice of God you know that's what's going to kill us right right amen yep you realize that people that are hearing this message is going to be life or death to you and I right amen Y is that true amen right it's going there's no gray areas in that PL right we're either going to have to take what he said that's right and I spent my biggest portion of my Ministry defining to show you know brother Ray and I were talking this morning about brother Brandon probably say about 20 times he's going to get a new body sure then he turns around and he says well now it's not another body it's this body redeemed that's right cuz what goes down comes up right well just put those two together and you got it right amen this old body if it goes to the Grave it's coming back up brand new Trump going to get a new body but not another body this body is going to be made new amen now we got it right but I'm just going to take this quote you name me any Doctrine and by memory I can probably tell you two or three quotes it'll sound totally contrary but you give me any Scripture and I'll give you some scriptures that sound the contrary right right but you see we believe it's the word of God Amen for God to speak to you and I that way confounds the wise and Prudence it just they just get all dangled up in it and they can't figure it out cuz that's what it was in the Bible they were looking for him to come down there a great rid and Shining Prince great you know boy he's coming down he's going to roll that carpet right out to cisus of course that always had you know somebody involved you know it's always when people you watch somebody I got something going tell you nobody else don't know it I'm going to tell you this you just watch it you might not get it in that first service but the second one you going to get to find out that they're talking about theirself if you're smart enough you get it in the first one yeah if you don't listen to it three times you'll find out they talking about yourself right that's right I'll tell you when it comes you know what kind of a doctrine that is or an idea I've never told you this is my idea I tell you what I believe the prophet said if I have told you it's my idea I always tell you it's my idea no problem I just put it blind and blunt and then go on that way but now listen all right the prophet of God as we were talking this morning he says we feel that we've heard His Voice already in the opening of these seals yes that's paragraph one of the seventh seal he said with feel we've heard his voice speaking to us he said I already heard it what about looking for a voice when you're hearing the voice right is that something that's right if the Lord would just speak to me I I thought thought we believe that the prophet of God was the voice of God Amen I mean I thought that's what we had the understanding of you know then if he's a prophet then he's God's mouthpiece that's it to speak that even as it said a moment ago even a false prophet can't say something contrary to what God tells him you know it's in the Bible about b b right I don't mean it's in how bad is you know the prophets what is prophesied of the second coming or something like that it's in the scripture where he's prophesying right cuz he can't do it he can't be anything other than what that's what he told bam B I can't curse he'd open his mouth get ready to curse and he looked down and he said I see nothing he said come around here behind look this bad part about him he'd say they're the apple of my eye that's right right he just go to bless them like everything the only thing he was capable of doing is he figured out enough how to get them to right follow after the wrong thing but now listen so the voice of God why would we be looking for a voice of God when we have the magnetic tapes you know the things that has captured actually The Voice and we we had people that had ways I remember a man down here in Georgia one time said like this he said you you can't understand what brother Brown said if you standing there seeing his hands moving and and what he was pointing at and what he was doing and I never didn't know the voice of God had to do anything like that you know I always thought that it was to be now I'm honest I thought it was to be an inward voice right the prophet is an outward uh mouthpiece right that's right of God okay but you know still after him saying that if God doesn't speak to your heart to my heart Amen brother we don't know what he's saying right that's simple hear his voice I don't get do it I've got the scripture written the Bible said in this day here his voice not like it did in the days of pation right you notice the children of Israel heard the very voice of God yes sir amen Y and they send away their day of Grace and they said don't let God speak unless we die and then you ly people don't like the idea of some preacher talking about something God gave to him yeah to give to them y I can get it myself well why didn't you get it yourself to start with amen now don't try to make a job I didn't say what God told me in his word I said what he told me is written in his word that that we watch after your soul that you got to have a five-fold Ministry and the people this message don't like that that's right I didn't write it in the book amen a have anything to do with it right p with Paul about it that's right how can they hear without a preacher bless God I get it myself you bu your women preachers yeah right you know I get down there and I get hard don't I you know a preacher is supposed to be a man we know the women got their own little pull pits and you take care of those things and you each other we got it all laid in the right order we know all about it that's right you raise your families you do the thing right but God set a fivefold ministry that's right for the perfecting of the Saints and you got to depend on that if you're going well you mean I got a have five for minutes I didn't say it your Prophet said it well now you got a bunch of preachers out here that don't fit in that category because they're teaching things contrary well I know I have a carnal way of explaining things very carnal but a lot of times gets point across amen you know that the preacher is not preaching the correct truth of the word of God whether it be me you or who it is that we're a bunch of women preachers that's right well can I get that face on there enough to make it that's right and you know if you ain't careful we can wind up being a bunch of perverts y right now that's rough but that's what the Bible has to say I didn't write the book much of women preachers that look like men standing in the pullit preaching amen and saying this is what the Lord told me and everybody Glory Hallelujah they just running and just shouting all over did you hear what brother someone so saying I don't give up what he say if it ain't a right according to the word right now when it's right according to the word I holler amen that's right cuz I've heard from God that's right but you see I know but I thought the bride was to be the final voice of the final age under her Messenger right so I thought then to lay it would have something to do with this thing that's right that they would receive the voice of God right if you have trouble hearing the voice of God through a man then you would have had trouble talking to run around right that's right and listening to him because you do all right so if the Thunder is the voice of God and only the prophet knew what those Thunders were then he makes a statement one day that's easy for you lity to take and apply he said if somebody thinks they got those seven Thunders and it don't compare with the rest of the word said get away from them that's right amen that's simple amen that's simple so the Thunder is the voice of God because God promised Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10:7 the many scriptures that he promised us and he promised us that this messenger would come and he would do two things he turn the hearts of the children back to the Fai of the fathers and then the he reveal the seven Thunders which is a revelation containing the Seven Seals and it be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn our hearts back so you know what we're not waiting I I when I saw brother randam to be a prophet I quit everybody stay wait with me and listen to this problem I quit trying to hear from heaven right right we all as human beings would sure love to hear voices out of heaven right you know but it might be like that fell was is going down the road and his buddy was going to pull a trick on him so climbed up in a tree and he said he went by and he said John we got stop and look all said John he said you called a preach 40 something years later the guy that was up in the tree said what in the world can I tell him he's been preaching 40 years over my call but you see you can hear a lot of voices right true but if those voices don't speak according to the word of God what good AR they sounds beautiful oh but brother Dale you everybody's got a right to to who we want to listen to I haven't said a word about it what are you fussing but listen brother Brown says page 75 which is in the first seal paragraph 75 I'm not asking to pull these up I'm just quoting on lot this afternoon save time I'll get one in a minute and I I'll say pull up in at B of time okay he said through these seven Thunders will bring the church to Rapture and Faith well if it's through the Thunders then we need to know what they are if we're going to have Rapture and Faith simple logic right well I just don't believe we need to know what the Thunder say well you don't want Rapture in fith that's right right that's right I I didn't say this quote the prophet did you want us to pull up on the screen to read it he said paragraph 35 of the fourth seal said at the time of the seven [Music] Thunders we find Christ of Revelations 10 I guess it pull it down and at the time of those seven Thunders we find Christ are the angel come down with a rainbow and put his feet on the land and sea and swore by him that time had run [Music] out what is the thunder it's the voice of God speaking to you and I paragraph 146 of the first Feld paragraph 262 I think it's on the six first seal the voice of God when the seal opened the Thunder is the voice of God when the seal opened giving us his Revelation then we have heard by the opening of the word the voice of God now can you put your life on that you got to put it on something what is that saying if you won't stand for something you'll fall for nothing some way like that I don't remember exactly you'll fall for anything you stand for something that's right that's right so my stand has always been on one thing that we must depend upon what the prophet had to say Amen cuz only by that would we know the Thunders the the message and for him to come and be the voice of God would be the promise say God made to you and I Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 see but that's not all the scriptures we use those scriptures as relating to its Ministry is the thing but do we really truly mean that to say the prophet and we could say that he's the mouth peace of God can we truly believe that yes right well if I have just been back there well let's see if I can quote a little bit from memory he said that picture that was taken of the Angel of the Lord was greater than for you to stand the presence of God I'm paraphrasing that so don't worry about it but it's close he said because the scientific camera of you know the eye of the camera cannot take psychology and said for you to be able to see that is more real than right anything you could comprehend the world has it up in the religious Hall of Arts but where they got it stuffed in the basement because of the one caption that is under it that says the only supernatural being that was ever photographed right you I was thinking about that the other day I wondered and I'm sure about me saying it to devil going to jump on it and run up somebody up there I figured by now they would have had that picture took apart I figured by now the religious people would have had that picture took apart and they would have rewrote the books about it and they would have proved according to their scientific knowledge that that was a wrong photograph but they haven't done it so far right right I guess that'll open up the canab beans where the devil will run up there and start doing it that's all right cuz anytime he starts fighting just remember you're going to find something good I love to get him stirred up because I know that I got him stirred up and I get him stirred up things are going to happen right right you know but now listen the voice of God speaking to you and I the mouthpiece of God the children of Israel had the opportunity I come right up to it this morning back away knowing i' be here with doing this the children of Israel had the opportunity to hear yesen and they said don't let God speak Les we die I've always said you know Moses had a burning bush well when the children of Israel come back out to the mountain out there everybody had a bush right right the whole Mountain was on fire amen they said Moses you go up there and you get it and and you come back yeah that was never to been God's way of doing things that's right he wanted to speak to every one of them amen amen but instead of being able to speak to every one of them he had to say okay that's what you want course none of us was back there and so none of us would fit in this category I hope right so what do we say now what does everybody say now see then they said let not God speak Moses you go get it and come and tell us now they say don't let man speak we're going straight to God but too late right cuz it ain't going to work am right why because you chose it but brother hell I wasn't there I didn't choose that what are you choosing now right yeah come on I put in a little bit this morning about the million dollars and telling you you need to come back this evening and give away your million cuz you might get something else well a lot of people don't want to come back they want to keep their million dirty old guy Ain but is that the truth true amen do I speak with forking tongue no all right see church if we've heard the voice of God why are we looking for the voice of God right amen amen I know I'm accused of being a real old deep preacher and boy that's deep I mean right you know these little kids here they tell you exactly what I just said that's that's deep now what it means is you don't want to agree with it that's right you want the voice of God but you're running all over the country trying to find a voice of God that's why you got so much Church hopping y that's true these people running from church to church and trying to find the voice of God what are you hiding for amen that's right to jump in churches you'd be better off stay home listen to t you say yeah but you just said want to go to that I'll agree that's not right but I'm just saying it like it is see Church we're looking for something that we already have that's right amen right that's correct sir they always said you go out in the football field you know that's why the Bible says you stumble a stumbling Stone and my best way of definition of that is you go out in the football field you know it's supposed to be all cut green grass you know smooth nothing out there few lines and you little bit and right out in the middle of that football field is a a football you know a rock that big and you just looking all over the place and you just stumble all over that rock who put that there y they what do you mean that was what I was looking for that's what it means is you stumble at The Stumbling Stone you're looking for it all over it can't see it amen this message is a headstone to the of Jesus Christ why you looking for a headstone to come boy one of these day that headstone going to come out of Heaven work that's what we're going to get down to find out try to prove it by the natural to show you finding out a lot of these things is already taken place and we're looking for them to happen your prophet of God had no problem with saying he is here I'm not looking for his coming I'm saying he's here he noou well God listen and I hope you understand this a God in heaven will do you no good on earth right we had that in a denominations Our God was up in heaven somewhere else no personality down here with us yes but one of these days we're going to get up our worries at like I've always said man has spent 6,000 years trying to prove there's a God in heaven and God has spent 6,000 years trying to prove he's down on Earth you know that brother randam did say the reason they was silence in heaven you know what he said the reason there was silence in heaven how many remember the quote amen he said cuz nothing up that's right that's what he said be glad to find it already somewhere in here let's see I might even be able to find it right now hang on a second paragraph 348 of the sardian church age which would be 348 Church age book he said the reason the silence in heaven God is empty y that's right that's yes listen Church what are we looking for have we ever realized yet pull up number nine brother Jo have you ever realized these scriptures but this we say unto you you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent hinder in other words them which are asleep why is it that we can't hinder why is it that they can't be hindered well you say they're asleep no the far means you're going to explain it righten okay I'm not a good English major but I I got a little sense for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout amen with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead and Christ shall rise first for the Lord himself amen shall descend from heaven with a shout now we had that all figured out didn't we one of these days there's going to be in the Eastern sky a great thing that's going to happen and we're going to hear a voice somebody that holler hey a big sh and the Lord is going to descend out of that Eastern sky right down to where we are like I said this morning that's what confus didn't like cuz they had that figured out see they had it all figured out that Jesus's first coming was going to be and he's going to come down he's going to roll the carpet right up to cus and he's going to walk up there and he say oh cus you've been a great ruler of my people and I've come to you well that wasn't exactly the way it happened right you know yeah he had the opportunity to be able to receive it right but because of the way that it came he didn't receive it you think you can convince the world that this message this Prophet has brought is the voice of God go try yeah that's right just get talking to somebody and say folks you know there's a voice of God you know if you you don't like brother Tom now I'm not thr off on him but brother Tom would do it your church ain't preaching the Seven Seals and you're out that's the way Tom talk they let me write it down for you you always kept a pad in a pencil I write these scriptures down I kept telling him Tom you can't do that but you see he he was glad to say them things sure right if your pastor ain't preaching the seals you need to get you another Pastor you know but all right can do you think you can convince the world that we believe the Lord descended from Heaven that's right in this message y right do we really believe that that's right or is it a good quote Yeah remember well Robert University can say that they got the tape what he brother around say he said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and the shout is this message now you think they going to believe that well why is everybody in this message still looking for some way or somebody why is it when these young guys come up you know these new ones come on the field that everybody runs to them and just like glue they'll just run right to them and they'll just sit down there and they boy they'll just oh man a something this is the one we waited don't this is the one this is him this is him we we waited on this one right here and then after a while you see it just ding down just fade away and that's right they run over to another one this is it that that wasn't it but this is it well after a while I'd get down to find out who's what that's [Music] right amen he said Brother D you sound like you're saying that you don't want people to come to this church I don't want nobody to come to this church that don't want the word is that blown enough amen that's right you say you mean you don't want me here if you don't want to words you're hindering me and I'm hindering you go somewhere that God can speak to your heart cuz we don't have a lot of time left to realize that by now that's right and that way I'm not trying to run nobody off I wouldn't be on the internet if I was trying to do that but I do not Pastor the internet you know that that's right I will not do that don't call me asking me your questions you ask your pastor you question said I got one one or two that said I am the pastor I want know I said I ain't answering yet go to the message I said nothing else there's a there's a take you'll run down the list you'll find on our somewhere that I explain that you can go listen to it that way cuz I'm not going to Pastor it yeah I don't believe in that I believe there's one voice to this age amen that was brought to this age and that was brother Ram's voice but I believe it must be taken by the fivefold ministry and broke down to the people to where that they can eat what's being given out because it was in such a big old chunks when he gave it out am I floting him that's he said I break it off in big nuggets he said these brothers will take it and break it down and he said bring on the coming of the Lord I make no statement but I'm trying to get you to look at a point look at number 10 on the on the notes we know this it shouldn't be a solve problems with you and I it shouldn't be anything to think about the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout what is the shout they'll get it in a second then you read what the prophet said to shout is shout is the message Y what message yep who message mhm you sure get then they get behind them there not throwing off them Butz sometimes it is I jump from one to the other when coming down and they don't know where in the world I'm going to paragraph 130 through 133 134 okay we get it I knew they do it said three things happen a voice a shout a voice a trumpet now that's not four thing right you know what I'm saying a shout a voice a shout a voice a trumpet that's not four thing read it three of them is what a shout a voice and a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears now watch this has to have already happened are we in bad shape CU watch Jesus does all three of them when he's he he's he's descending amen so that's perfectly scriptural then the shout is the voice of God Amen and Jesus does all three of these in his descending right so then it wasn't brother R's message it was a message of God Amen delivered by Brother Ram into our hand that's right read on a shout what is the shout it's the message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride right and God has a way of doing things and he never changes his policy he never changes his he's the unchanging God in Amos 3:7 he said he would do nothing on the earth until first he revealed it to his servants a prophet just as certain as he promised it he'll do it amen amen all right Shout the message you realize then as I was saying this morning that brother R had to do a work of restoration and this isn't according to the Rapture um in a minute I'll get more of it recognize your day and your message I believe brother says not in the years of preparation said when it begins to sound we know that brother brandom had to come and preach us back to the faith of the fathers or preaches back to the revelation of the word of God in its Purity we understand that but that was not his message that's why that the prophet said I had these this morning but it didn't didn't bring it do you realize that we have to be a prophetic people that's right amen that's what your Prophet said would have to be a prophetic people and there would have to be a prophetic message he said not just one studying scriptures and things right it's going to take a special class of people to be able to stand in the end time that's why almost 40 years ago I said this and that's Brother Ray and I talking about this this morning somewhere close to 40 years ago I told you that the biggest portion of the people of this message would die and go by the grave hey folks don't think that I wrote that two weeks ago I've got living proof sitting here before me that some people have been here for almost 30 years and they can tell you that I said it that's right right that's right it wasn't two weeks ago when I realized that a lot of old people going to die that's right no I just saw the the message people were not receiving the message and I say it again if we believe this message is a shout why are we trying to get brother so and so to tell us what it means right amen why are we trying to get brother Dale to tell us what it meant if it's a supernatural message it requires a supernatural I'm quoting Brother brandham people to understand that message not just one with the baptism of the Holy Ghost has been wonderful down through the ages to secur us into the body of Christ but just like he saids 464 the old seal book go home and read it he said there's no messenger of the age he speaks of Luther he speaks of Wesley he speaks of the Pentecostal Lusa Street and he says no messenger the age he said because the Holy Ghost came himself that's right in the fullness but said at the end is always of the ages said then the messenger is sent Amen brother R's message begun in 63 when he started bringing those seals and and bringing the word to us to Pure unadulterated and he preached for almost three years there the message bringing it amen back up to 62 about the greatest battle ever fought and you'll automatically come out almost 3 and 1/2 years of the Ministry just like Jesus said amen you see then we've heard the shout there's not going to be a shout to raise and to do this out or the other I think it should be that you and I should shout amen you know what amen a shout the message yep to get the people ready now what was the message the opening of The Seven Seals now I'm just going to run through real fast on something cuz when brother brandham come over there to preaching in that seventh seal he said this is my revelation of it he begins to talk about the seven Thunders and the opening of the word I'm asking you to go home and read the seal book for one time and just sit down there and think about what you're reading the S sealed especially he starts explaining about a vision that he had many many years ago which I think was about s years in between there more or something but he had it in 1956 he mentions it first one of my people talked about used to be called the interval uh and 56101 I think it's right but anyhow he mentions about what was known and been called the tent vision and he starts out by a little shoe in the hand and trying to catch the little fish and going with the shoe and the different things now he says this is what was being made known to him in that seventh seal right of what had been in his life right we talk about the sword in the hand he called it that in the seventh seal MH but what about where he says the sword God put in his hand 30 something years ago and told him to March forth to the coming of the Lord you said well brother Dale you're D you're on Danger ground cuz you're trying to interpret I'm not trying to interpret I'm telling you the things the prophet said it was right that's up to you he said it was that tent Vision he said it was the angels of the Lord the vision that was haded he was to go west and come back and he said this is the Fulfillment of that even to the angel of the Lord he said come bring me back here tonight for this message he said right he speaks of the sword in the hand where he was to go up into sabben Canyon and he was scared because he looked he saw a sword in his hand and said a voice spoke to him and said this is the Furman of your ministry he had the BL that went off and he speaks of out west and he thought it was his own death and he said this is that third pool he brings out many many prom or many many thoughts that God has dealt with him in his life and he's explaining what the seal is just as I said this morning and will say again that Jesus only preached six seals CU he was the seven that shouldn't be no problem problem should it page 45 it's a rising the sun he is on seals you see church he starts telling us what's happening in his own ministry that's right that's right the tent Vision The Sword in the hand the Angels he met yes the many things that he covers in the seventh seal he's talking about God in his life and the things that had happened that week he said it's not been a man it's been the angels of the Lord right he he said bring me back here for this message tonight amen the great Thunder and the great blast he said that went forth has now been know amen thank you Lord you see he called at the opening of the word he said there God met us the opening of these seals and it become a brand new book I've heard preachers have in the message for 3 months and get up and say it's a brand new new book I thought you ain't even read the first page yet you ain't even read page one and how can you say it's a new book cuz if you going to say it's a new book you got to read the book and then say I got a new book heard preachers get up and say I take every Spirit here under my control you ever heard them say that I'd hate for something to get up and run up there I just try to be honest I told you I read the seal book the first time and when I did when I got to the seventh seal I literally stopped and I thought Lord I've always I've thought from what was started studying the message and thought this was God's name man but now seemingly he's turned to his own self of expressing his own life instead of [Music] expressing the letter of the word even I'm honest that's what I said see you won't get preachers to admit stuff like that no no I've been in there all along I believed it from the beginning yeah a lot of you said that it took me six months to get you straighten out on water baptism yeah but yet you think well I'm really I seen it right to start with well why didn't you do something about it you saved me 6 months I could have been working on somebody else that's right but listen church I studied and studied and studied for years then before I ever go back to the seal book oh yeah I read it but then one day I felt led like that there was something and I just started now preach 1 2 3 4 5 6 and preach what I could see from thoughts and ideas from the seventh and I laid it down because it was like there was something wrong I wouldn't getting the point Point even though I was bringing 79 I could if we had to take you would listen to them and you'd say well that's identically what you're saying now yes sir but then one day about 82 I picked it up again I begin to read then I saw each seal as it become to an end the end of the first seal was the opening of the second the only way you can keep your star steps running right these cartenders out here are no better than that thing you got to have something to base it on then you got to keep them steps in line all the way up and you can't put a 6 in step on a 7 in Riser your insurance won't cover no am I right I don't know exactly what the Riser is is it 7 in is a certain that measurement but you got to be out and up or your insurance won't cover it if your insurance comes to your home and your steps are not according to standard they can sue you people can for falling because the step is off because you've got 6 in or 7 in out 7 in up what it is and that foot raises that every time and then you hit the next one it's 9 in you go and you hit that step cuz your brain is set on sitting it on seven that's why don't want you to wear your Crocs down at the airport right your Crocs you know the shoes cuz they're bigger they're wider they got a great big hump on the front you start trying to go up the steps with it you're going to get hung in the step you don't never read the church listen we've had a prophet to bring us a message yes we we've had the voice of God to speak to us well if God would only speak to me if God would only speak to me turn on the tape right turn on the tape and just say God speak to my heart Jesus we got them there to where the other night we just sat down and I think we listen to Three tapes might slept in half of one of them but got two of them a lot better than doing something else lot of people said I go to sleep at night with them in the ear that's good cuz at least we're hearing the voice of God amen but now here's our problem and I'm trying to cut this short you think I but here's our problem brother R tells us something we don't want to believe what he said right that's right he just don't understand my case I I've got to cut this a little bit of hair off because it just you know it's just this this this it's just he just don't understand my case all right what you need to do is find you a prophet yeah want agree with you right well he just don't understand I got to paint my face a little bit I got to just you know you need to find your Prophet that's right there's plenty of them in this message oh yeah that'll let you come to their church and just be happy and everybody ready to go right that's what it gets me I'm honest I'm sorry I'm on it I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm mean but you see people that they ain't been in church in 5 years and then they come to church Glory Hallelujah we're ready for the Rapture yeah Rapture here been well we just been waiting on it what you been doing well I admit we've been back to but all the time I back f i waiting on the Lord yeah okay get off there listen a shout the message going forth the message the prophet's message all the things that he covers now you go look the message and do what I've asked you to do and let's read number 14 real quick just go listen to the seventh seal or read it and listen to the things that he says you said well it's got to be this it's got to be that he spoke over and over in there that it was a third pull the tent Visions the third pool the angels of the Lord the third pool the third pool was the in the hand y he Tri all of it together to the third pull right well brother D you don't know what the third pull is okay I ask the prophet okay Prophet we need an answer today what is the third pull would you mind explaining it to me okay through off the message the anointed ones at the end time he says notice the very day that in this messenger not when he starts on that was what I was getting a while ago not when he just starts out but when he brings his message but when he begins to declare his message see the first pull he okay second pull prophesying are you ready third pool the opening of the word the mysterious reveal Mysteries reveal no more there no more High to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember the third pull was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word do you see it the congregation says amen but you say but Brother D there's so many things that goes with the third pool I there a tent to come I never argue with nobody about it never argue with nobody about it I have a lot of people ask me what I thought about it you know that they've even tried to start out west with tents and come across a country y thinking that when they would get to Jeffersonville that brother brandom would meet them there people because they're honest sure there's people that's got our planes ready to fly I'm not arguing about it the only thing I said about them airplane and sure it hurt my feelings to find out that they said R random was supposed to be in that certain airplane and the man said he he said it' take two years to get this thing where it could be flying well I'm just honest now you get mad at me he means it can't come for two years cuz he ain't went to work on it yet I like what brother per green had to say about it which wasn't derogatory said brother ROM needs a airplane I'll get him a 746 sure I'll beat that I'll get him a c5a cuz it's plenty big enough yeah right and I'm not thring no remarks at nobody right I've had people to lambas me to say you're out of the message because you don't believe the way we believe it well that's all right I'm just always honest with everybody if I don't see what you're talking about I told Paul Jones that about the sus old messy m s and talking with him I said I don't see what you're talking about I said I am not saying you're wrong I am saying I don't see it you pray for me and I'll pray for you amen that's the only thing that I've ever done with anybody but you see I believe that one day the prophet can come back and he can preach to us for 30 40 days I have no problem with that huh I don't have any trouble with that cuz the Dead's going to raise they going to be around your Ms about 30 40 days of course every like I always say you know wouldn't it be something I call brother brother Ray up and said Brother Ray have you heard about it they say the dead already right but I don't know where to believe it cuz I have you seen anything brother R now I don't think that's going to be what's going on that's right right amen you may put me in a straight jacket right but that's why them pictures is downstairs on the wall amen you let one of them down there walk in here and I'm going to tell you about it whether you believe it or not and I'm going to say hey brothers and sister old brother Jimmy Gibson just walked in cuz I know what he look like right right I'm not going to have any trouble why I wanted everybody's picture that brother Mo brother and sister Violet down there room on the wall I want to see what they look like I know him a long time I want to see what he look like amen but you see church that way brother ROM can come back and preach we can have a wonderful time but I still got to depend upon the scriptures that's right that he's in the ground waiting on you and I that's right I've got to say that cuzz that's what I believe he's waiting on you and I to bring him out I have no trouble with believing that he'll be the first in the resurrection right don't have no trouble with that that's right that's right that's right you see then I've been ridiculed because I won't say that I believe this I've had people to throw it in the face said how you going to spiritualize in Johnny houses youever heard down remember Under the Tent there was brother was talking about going around and putting up Johnny houses and staying for 2 3 weeks and preaching I don't have no problems cuz you know what there's going to be a lot of Johnny houses hanging around this message yeah called people yeah all right that won't believe the word right right amen you think the people would believe you think that any of the doctrines of the message the two Souls have done a virtue you think they're going to believe it if somebody told you in little Georgia the dead was walking Among Us no I ain't going to believe it you know why CU it's not in their Church you know what I wouldn't believe if he was in their to be honest you said the Dead's raised up here and this where they got polygamy I don't want that don't send to Georgia I'm not joking true that's true you see I hope you've enjoyed this and I've tried to bring about the seals now we're just going to get into some things in the Book of Revelation continue there through be related to the seals and continue on out through I will announce this I still have it laid on my test to preach on marriage and divorce and maybe about 6 months from now I might get around preaching on but uh you know cuz I do that about every four or 5 years or something just you know going through with the message not to ridicule nobody but just stay it like it is forget it cuz it's not time to argue and fuss over doctrines that's right it's time to walk amen that's right time to Rejoice about what we've heard brother R said John heard His Voice through the opening of The Seal have we heard our voice that's right that's right you don't call Gil Addison but every Revelation has been made known yes amen he's speaking your name amen thank you Jesus come on musician he speak in your name you heard the voice of God through the prophet of God we've heard his words we've heard the shout and you read the rest of the message voice of an archangel the same voice that raised Lazarus with the same voice that shouted that's right the Lord Jesus does all three of these things in his descending that's right so then we're not looking for the descending of brother brandom we're looking our have been looking for the descending of God but I hope we get away from looking for his coming to believe that he's here already he's here revealing his word that's right the more we believe that you'll see more healings and signs and wonders in 82 I asked God for something I don't ask him I don't ask God to prove his message for signs and wonders
