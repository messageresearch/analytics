in the house of the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading in the Matthew 19 we just continue our thoughts on uh we had a wonderful time last night at least I did in the Bible study we had a lot of things and brother was there visited with us Wednesday and got a chance to talk with him good bit about the scriptures and things and hope that it helped him and it helped all of us to kind of back up and think on some things and we had a good time but we're still on the doctrines of the message and uh you know we I told them we would not put names on our two much but you know we might hold up a flash card to let the people that's there know who's preaching some doctrines when people ask cuz we try not to be it was not on the internet anyway unless brother Joe puts it there for you to put a tape off of it or anything like that so you know but we just have a good time sitting around discussing the word of the Lord and you know it's a good day all right announcements remember Wade the Lord willing will be F flying out Friday and going to New Jersey and be preaching for certain Friday night so remember that and pray the Lord would bless them up there in the ministers meeting all right remember the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday so that will be announced your sisters getting everything together I'm sure for for the food and the things and we certainly appreciate it and all like that brother Jonathan Jones which would be brother Jimmy Gibson's uh son-in-law will be preaching on Saturday night and Sunday morning for us and just pray that the Lord would bless him I know you already prayed for brother George Canada but keep him in your hearts he's the age is getting on to him and all and they're in the nursing home so if you get a chance to go see him then go by and visit with him because it would help him all right now I ask you to uh please listen to this afternoon's message if you're not going to be here please listen because we're going to try to get on to the grace of marriage and divorce and if you're not going to be with us please please listen to the service that way uh you will know what we're trying to bring all right Matthew 19 3-9 Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for the truly the grace that you've extended unto us that you would bring a people that is not worthy of anything whatsoever not even in the lineages or in the thoughts of mankind to think that we bunch of gentile people could ever even be saved but they they did couldn't read your thoughts Lord because we were in your thoughts and your minds before the world and we thank you that we're now making manifest upon Earth that mind that you had of us and just help us to be what you want us to be bless us now as we read the scriptures and as we talk about you we love you and we thank you and just have your way remember the sick among us you said it and we believe it you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction and we thank you have your way now in Jesus name amen any other announcements that I'm most of the time I fail to remember everything but just doing that okay Matthew 19 now I ask you too if you will read the invisible Union or listen to the tape or whatever because you remember in The Invisible union he said this is just a higher order of marriage and divorce so I believe the only way we can understand truly the grace of God is to take it all the way through that's right and come out to the end with a correct understanding all right now the Pharisees came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and femal so would it be any way of doing those things all right and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twine shall be one flesh wherefore there are no more twine but one flesh so now how can you get all of this mess up into it what therefore God hath joined together let not man put aund they say unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away and he said unto them Moses because of the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and who so Marth her which is put away doth commit adultery you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been trying to bring down the the the things and and speaking of uh the things and and showing you know uh what makes a marriage and what all of those things are to not condemn no one but to uh you know uh bring us to a place of understanding the scriptures all right see then the the prophet's message and the scriptures gives us a clear understanding of their lives and where we are and things like that and and this is not to condemn no one else we're all guilty that's right when we finish this up you may not be guilty of a natural adulterous act Etc or whatever you know but when we get into the invisible Union you'll find that we are all guilty of spiritual adultery because it's not many wives and things we have maybe maybe it would mess us up in the invisible Union is how many husbands that we have and you say but I only have one husband well we were married to organized religion that was our husband whether you like it or not that's the way the word is all right but just to you know to to get it plain all right but see we tried to cover this past Wednesday on the basis of of you know what would come stitute a marriage and you know trying to find out scripturally and from the prophet what makes it to be whether or not we would need a Grace or whether or not we don't need a Grace we went through some of the things on uh you know through the series we've been through some things that you know if a man's wife dies then he's free to marry but he must marry in the Lord he's not free to just just marry anybody he he has to marry a virgin you said well that's hard to keep the lineup on that well it wouldn't be if we line up the scriptures and understand a lot of things and and understand that a woman is a virgin when she marries and if her husband dies she's still a virgin that's that's scripturally and that's in God you don't understand that and if that husband dies and she marries again as long as it's in the Lord she's still a virgin that's because see it's it's getting it messed up with too many husbands Eve didn't have a problem in the garden with how many wives Eve had a trouble in the garden of how many husbands she had see and that was her trouble CU she had the Beast and she had Adam and that made a whole lot of situation all right but now going through the scriptures then to see that people would say you can go down to the courthouse I can prove by Courthouse I ain't never been married but one time well that's that's fine but that's carnal understanding too because we found out for you to be engaged you're married right all right and that's why we caution the children kids don't talk the boy ask you to marry him don't just joke Le oh yes I will be careful about those things don't get involved in it boys don't ask girl to marry you until you fully prayed and understand and and get everything right you know and all like that because you know I mean you're just a bunch of little old kids running around and you say well how old was you and your wife when you married I was 18 she was 16 bless you we've been together 55 years so I think it's held you know it'll be what 55 this coming or 51 be 55 this coming August all right now we'll get into some things that are serious when we get down to the vows and the things that we're going to talk about a little more about the engagement but you know uh I'm just one that believes in oldfashioned Christianity amen you know I I believe that the Christian the new birth should have taken care of a lot of our problem problems yes of course we didn't have it we wasn't born with it we had to receive it and some of us didn't receive it until way on in life you know which meant we lived Our Lives you know and and all like that but yet uh still you know we have to come to a place of understanding amen but the Bible tells uh man and the woman both you remember I I brought that out see we think that the woman's got to be the Virgin but we don't think about the man being a virgin Paul speaks of The Virginity of a man as well as the virginity of a woman you need the scriptures we'll go into those things you know but I mean you ought to be able to read a little and and see we say well it's okay for him see we can read brother ROM said it's not said about him but it's said about her then you just place that on anything you want to see that's what they had done with the the grace of marriage and divorce that Moses had given the permissions and that but we went through that it wasn't just for burning the bread or you know you didn't like each others or whatever right CU we just read no man can put away his wife except it be for fornication now that we just read what Jesus said you're going to argue with him then go back to Deuteronomy 24 and see what Moses was talking about he was talking about a divorce situation all right see we've tried to make these things blunt and I'm sorry I am I'm sorry for being blunt and sometime using offline words to express my thoughts but at least you know what I'm saying and anybody else can look up words and find out what I'm talking about I'm not degrading people because the one you're looking at is degraded as well as anybody that's that I'm looking at or on or whatever they're seeing none of us have no rights whatsoever and when we get into invisible Union you'll find out more about that that we're all born in bad shape we're all born in sin shaped in iniquity spoused my mother's wound and went forth a liar that's putting about four scripture three or four together but it's true right nobody's looking down on no body else that's right but if you're looking down on somebody because you're goody goody just remember that's right you are the person that I'm hollering and screaming about to try to get you to see get away from that goody goody Holiness line you think you are I believe in true Holiness thank God for people that have kept themselves women men that have kept themselves but see that's the way the point you know most everybody thinks it's right for the the man he can go out just live do what he does he's boy you know he now give me the scripture for that the boy supposed to be a Christian as well as a girl supposed to be a Christian right amen as a matter of fact brother Brandon will blame him he said it's your fault boys it's your fault man all right we can get into a lot of things but forgive me for being blunt but at least there's one thing about it you can't say that you don't know what I'm talking about right right cuz that's that's the way it goes all right but see we found out that when you're are a spoused betral engaged word engaged is not used in the the New Testament or the oldest there's one time it's used in there speaking of an Engaged but the word word is espoused or betrothed but it's coming down to modern day terms we went through those things I've called engaged all right now see most people think a wedding is when a man and a woman goes up stands before the altar they go down they sign the paperwork that's part of it then they come up and they stand before the the the the uh the preacher you know and the preacher pronounces a man and wife and then they go home and live together you know in relationship they say that's a marriage well now according to the Bible of what we went through when God gave adam a woman he said it's Flesh of My Flesh and bone of my bones I gave you the quote where the brother Brandon was covering that that was when they were engaged you know that was that was him saying it about her but then God turns around and calls it his wife they're in Genesis right Joseph was a spouse to Mary engaged you know betrothed God said fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife now you're going to argue with God about it or translations or whatever you want to with it go to any of them and look him up but the point is that I'm getting at see that when when you ask a girl to marry you and she accepts now if she don't accept that's not a wedding everybody clear we're not in the we're in a modern age today where the girls ask the boys to marry him but that's not in the form of scriptures or anything that's uh you know uh that's that's the problem of the age we're living but if a girl asks a boy to marry her and the boy says yes I'll marry you that's a wedding it don't give you a right to live together right see that's the supposed to be done later you're supposed to wait for those if you're going to try to be anything in Christianity if you're not going to be anything in Christianity eat drink and be merried cuz tomorrow you're going to burn up that's right forget it right that's where brother ROM I gave you the quote where we talking about polygamy he said the Christian World in other words tried to force poly Force the the thing to get away from those things and he said in those countries where there was polygamy there was a better world but he said polygamy is wrong he said don't you say that I believe in polygamy I don't all right now but getting down to it see I said some believe you're only married when you're consummated into that but now the engagement when the boy asks a girl or even here in the state of Georgia now according to the law if you live together overnight Etc whatever with the intent of ever marrying I think is the wordings of it you're counted common law even the law see that's what the prophet was saying we took the laws of Christianity and which is good he wasn't saying it was wrong but we forced that upon all of the world look at us today what are we doing we're going overseas to free those women and want to set them free what we do make prostitutes out of them we're really good at freeing people aren't we see we're trying to religionization that the Bible had already spoke of and called him husband and wife all right these are just quotes now from paragraph 86 of invisible Union 65125 brother BR says you're engaged to her as far as God is concerned you're married to her paragraph 193 questions and answers book 2648 23 the evening service your vow is sacred and that's what marries you he says no preacher can marry you he said it's your vows that marry you then you go to the preacher then you go to the thing paragraph 197 questions and answered book two he said even in the Old Testament now listen this is the one that I really you order to just read it over and over he said even in the Old Testament if you promis to marry a woman and you married another he said you was committing adultery and put out of the camp what do you mean b it was legal back there there that old Deacon said that time he called it polygamy trying to get you to life cuz everybody's so right now for some reason but I mean even in the Old Testament when polygamy was legal right do you understand what the situation would have to be then he would promise a girl to marry her if he didn't go through with that marriage before he went through with number 5 6 7 8 10 12 or 14 he was living in adultery you had to keep his word You Remember by your words you'll be justified and by your words you'll be condemned the Bible said Every Idle Word Jesus said you'll have to give an account for that's right so where are we all right now the prophet paragraph 207 Daniel Daniel's 70th week the way they call it now uh 61 I think it's 806 he said polygamy is wrong we know then on e47 of the supernatural 56129 he says don't you say that I believe in polygamy I don't all right now then we're he's playing we're playing to understand what a vow is that's what we're going to talk about today a vow a vow we're going to cover the scriptures on a vow and remember my whole point is what if you're engaged as far as God is concerned you're married right Joseph and Mary were a spoused right but they wouldn't living together right because that goes into uncleanness you don't go that way well they're already married yeah you go over to some of these countries that some of these are from where that they don't have a preacher to get up and say The Vow they get together they talk it over the two families decide and the last thing you see is the husband and wife stepping over a stick into their little house but they're married married they're married they better not break that vow they do they're killed it's not just because we go down to some preacher or or go down and find out at the courthouse right so if you're engaged you're married we have to deal with those things then you go marry a boy after then what are you living in right all right but the boy see he's engaged he goes marryed a girl what's he living in that's where we want the woman's side she's the dog meat she's the byproduct she's the the thing that's not worth anything the Bible lays it down for both of us and doesn't make changes about but into certain Avenues between the man and the woman when the prophet said he can but she can't he can if he's got grounds too but if he ain't got scriptural grounds he can't divorce his wife and marry again that's right the prophet was even so specific he said you can put away your wife for cutting her high but he said but you can't marry again for that grounds so where are we at then and even if the Old Testament would hold it to be if a man promised a girl and then went off married somebody else before he come back married before he married that one he was living in adultery and the B and the prophet said put out the camp if that was true under that how much would it be true now when we're not living under the types and shadows we're in the what would be called the antip which means a fulfillment of the type amen we're not typing Christ in the church we are Christ in the church and a true husband and wife is a standing in a form showing of the same as Adam and Eve in the garden all right you said well none of us don't have no hopes all right we're going to get on down try to make it a little harder then see they try to take away some of these ideas we were talking with the brother last night that had come Wednesday night well see I told him I said you're sitting talking from your old thoughts of what organized religion has taught you we're talking about what the word says right you're saying you're quoting the word but we're taking the letter of the word that has been revealed to us to where we can see that he couldn't see that hell wouldn't Eternal you know I mean that was his point he couldn't see it you know what as a scripture opened up to me last night I'd never seen anywhere never thought about it connected to whether hell's Eternal or not and when I quoted it to the brother it just unfolded the Bible says death and in hell so now hell can't be Eternal because the scriptures we go through the you know the eternal life the thing but go back in the Scripture it says death and hell is cast into the Lake of Fire right which is the second death now death means annihilated death don't mean dying you know death means annihilation ated amen and that opened to me last night I said God I'm glad to be here with death and hell is cast into the Lake of Fire and then the second death is the death of the Soul see then that's the end of all things see the second death means you're dead it means it's annihilated then hell can't be Eternal cuz death and hell is is cast into the Lake of Fire see they're both annihilated all right this won't charge you for that I I like it when when I I see scriptures unfold you know 40 years studying on whether the hell's Eternal or not and Lord open a scripture up that we've read how many millions of times maybe in that period of time but he opens it up and then you see it okay all right now let's get into what we want to cover today and get started I want to go back over this one quotation from the from the prophet and then we will get into some scriptures so let's go to where the Prophet preached in 19 uh 65 63 12 13 we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship all right watch what he says paragraph 65 and 66 he's talking about Joseph and Mary and the spouse you know all right now I'd like to pass this on before we go further espousing in the old in the East was the same as marriage is betral and as soon as they as they were a spoused they were married when that sacred vow between them was taken what's Now read Deuteronomy we're going to read this 223 you'll find out that when this young woman and the man agreed to be married yet they did not take the vows for months later is that Joseph and Mary they were espoused but they take didn't take the vows and thing what and if they even broke that vow they were guilty of adultery that's right then they were ASP when they were espoused they were just the same as marriage the law had not given them rights to live together as husband and wife yet but before God when they promised one another their words they were sealed in God's kingdom and to to break that was just committing adultery and now Joseph was a spouse to Mary goes on to telling the men if you understand all right now look at Deuteronomy let's read that if I don't get into the grace of marriage and divorce this evening I'll do it Wednesday night don't matter to me I just preach till I get through and quit have you ever read Deuteronomy I'm sure you have but have you ever read it and looked at it the Bible is so beautiful it's perfect the way it states until you don't have no right to argue about good to see sister Carver back there with us watch now it says if a damel is a virgin that is a virgin be betroth unto a husband and a man find her in the city and lie with her now watch how specific the Bible is then then you shall bring them both out of the gate of that City and you shall Stone them with stones that they die the damel because she cried not see she's in a city she cries in a city she could be heard watch the other when she's out in the country can't be heard look how specific it is because she cried not being the city and the man because he hath humbled his neighbor's wife now she's just betr but the Bible says he's humble his neighbor's wife so Thou shalt put away evil from among it but if a man find a betro damel in the field see now this was in the city and she cried somebody would hear you in the city but watch The Script but if a man find a betro damel in the field and the Man force her in lie with her then the man only that lie with her shall die he said well what's that meaning he's in the city here in the country was in the city she could be heard crying right well we were in a modern day when they put H over the mouth don't be silly bite his finger scream take other measures I know I'm blunt just take other measures hit him where it hurts and he won't rape you you said do that away well why not I'm just playing look but the damel Thou shalt do nothing unto the damel there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death now it says far as when a man rises against his neighbor you know what that is when you go back over the other scripture if neighbors rise up and one kill the other one you could run over to the to the um Refuge City and they couldn't get you all right so there's nothing in the woman there is nothing in the zamel no sin worthy of death that's why I've always said a girl that is raped that's not a wedding no and she's still a virgin if she was truly raped now if she volunteered we're back up over here she didn't holler but if you're out in the country see under the dam there's nothing for he found for he found her in the field and the betro dsh cried and there was none to save her see cities you could cry somebody here out in a country nobody would hear it watch now look how close it is if a man find a damsel that is a virgin which is not betrothed she's not engaged and he lay hold on her and lie with her and they be found in other words they find it out then the man that lay with her shall give unto her the dam cel's father 50 shickles of silver and she shall be his wife because he hath humbled her no husband inv look he may not put her away all of his days I've got the quote somewhere laying on the table at the house or something I'll be glad to find it brother brandham said no matter what she ever does he can't put her away no no she go out some no you going to argue with your prophet he said no matter what she ever done called he humbled her Bible strict Prophet strict truth is truth but do we want the truth or we want well I I believe what I believe well okay the Constitution gives you that right right not the Bible and not the prophet but the Constitution gives you that right but are we going to live by the Constitution or we going to live by God's word amen so let's talk about this vowing a vow let's see how serious it is to vow vow Every Idle Word the Bible said Jesus said Matthew there where he was speaking when he goes on down and says by your words to be justified and by your words to be condemned that's vers 36 and 37 in Matthew there I think it's what 23 or but anyhow but look at the next one look at number two what does it mean like to vow a vow he said evening messenger 63116 you go down to paragraph 307 and look what he says you want a closer walk with him come make a vow stand by him and keep it it won't do no good to make the vow unless you keep it right you can make your vow God has to feel it you just hold your vow right now we expect God to keep his word don't we right we ask him to keep his word you know what he asks us to keep our word you know what he expects us to keep our word we shouldn't blabber you know and mean the old saying this water bunks us old country folks boys used to be you know somebody runs up to you I'm going to bust your nose don't worry about him he ain't going to hit you cuz he hit you when he come running just bust his and forget it cuz he ain't going to hurt you cuz he running his mouth see somebody keep running their mouth just don't worry about the running their mouth they're not going to keep their word but we expect God to keep his word right was that Lord I took you at your word you said by your stripes I'm Healed now Lord is there something wrong well you know what he expects us to keep our word right when you became a Christian when you accepted Jesus Christ as your savior you vowed a vow why is it today even in the schools they try to give get the kids to take a vow of abstainers even in the schools that's all right I don't have no problems with it I just say it this way you mean you got to tell a Christian girl or Christian boy do not go out and live wrong you mean they got a vow to where they can vow to where they can keep their vow that's just getting your mentally working your mental abilities but there's no need of making a vow if you're not going to keep it he said honey I I vow to live true to you but I just think been able to well now your vow wasn't right in other words plain language you didn't mean it right you make a vow keep the vow because we ought to be Christians about it right see AOW to be it's a very important part of us there's no need of making that vow unless you are intended to keep it Dr old saying is talk is cheap except when you are a lawyer and it cost you but talk is cheap but it shouldn't be I told you we live in the day I'm old enough 73 I live in a time when my neighbor I've told you over and over about it had a store sitting there you could walk in store he was not even there most of the time you went in got what you wanted laid the money on the table and walked out if you didn't have the money to pay for it you R signed a piece of paper laid it on the table went on about your business you went back and paid him later when you had the money we didn't have no locks on our doors anybody coming down the road about 6 7:00 in the evening he would just asked to come in and spend the night you you fed him and give him a place to sleep of course I know we can't do that now we're living in a different world but I'm just saying what happened to it what happened to the being honesty and being right and being true and not lying I've heard some of you tell say well I was a professional liar I begin to believe my lies we was all born a liar I was a liar just like he was a liar but I didn't try to lie and I can stand here and honestly say I don't believe I ever tried to really lie out of anything when somebody asked me the school teacher asked me if I done it I told him I done it took the whiping and went on because I didn't believe in lying I believe anybody ought to keep your word if you're a liar you ought to repent for being a liar have you ever ask God to forgive you for being a liar CU if not you'll get in life today and you'll start lying well you ain't nobody around here can say I'm a liar that's one thing you won't say cuz I try my best to keep my word now if I promise you something and I can't keep it that's you call that well you know but I try my best to why because our word ought to be our Bond as a human being as a mortal being without one oun or Stat of Christianity right it order to be our bond right why because we're human beings but yet we just the way it is now you just anything anything you go yeah and see then you you wind up and you're engaged now I'm not going to ask you how many of you done this but I'll just make a statement when my wife and I you can say what he was 18 she was 16 we dated for a while when I was 16 she was 14 of course she wouldn't go with me nowhere but to the church or we had a double date with somebody else so we broke up and we didn't date for about a year something like that maybe a little less but then we got back together long whole story a lot of lives in it where she was dating my brother and you know one day I just run across her again we started dating but you know once we started talking of seriousness of ever being getting married or anything I never have asked her if she kept her word or didn't date nobody else because that's her business but over a year I never dated nobody for any reason now you understand my terminologies I never dated no one for over a year I had found the one I wanted to be my wife and I certainly didn't want to lose her by goofing up and dating the girls when even had opportunities and offers and things of even the girls and you know they had begin in that day to say I'll date you if so and so you know now they just come out and ask for everything else but I never dated nobody for over a year now is it something do you be engaged you know I mean you get engaged and what about it now boys and girls I mean how many of you kept it you got engaged I mean you really got engaged you really become engaged you know you wrote it out in the paper or become engaged and then you dated somebody else during that period of time I think you need an old fion repentance to your wife right now cuz you Dishonored her I don't care who you are we don't play games with the word of God if you were engaged and you wound up dating somebody else while you were engaged what kind of an engagement is that well we didn't know I know it I understand that we didn't know we didn't know that when we was engaged we were as married until we begin reading this message right we didn't understand an engagement was the same as was a wedding and if we broke that we were in adultery we didn't understand that till we heard this message sure but how many of you went out with other boys after you become engaged or other girls after you become engaged pretty serious ain't it and when you went out with other boys and other girls you know ever which way you go Bo and then you turned around and you kiss that boy or kiss that girl that you were dating while you were engaged see brother Dale when he talks he tries to talk straight that way I don't have to back up later and change things and 40 years ago I preached this and I was 43 years old and I mean 33 years old and I preached it and I believed it then and I believe it now that's not bragging that I was I didn't date nobody for over a year and we wasn't even what you would call engaged we were just discussing marriages and that you know how many kids we're going to have that's nothing wrong with that you can talk to each other about where you're going to live and how many kids you're going to have and all like that's not weddings that's not engagements it's just finding out what's going to be all right but how many of you can say that I didn't date nobody else or I went out with some boy while I was engaged or I went out with some girl and I kissed on them or something you know well puts us in a horrible shape right why let's go to number three and see what the prophet had to say about Just a Kiss what do you mean brother Dale you I kiss boys I kiss girls so you know these quotes but let's read them again all right invisible Union of the bride of Christ 1965 11:25 paragraph 88 look on these screens and see those these movie stars kissing and hugging and slopping around over these women a woman that does that is of a bad character now he covers the woman but remember the man is involved right she don't kiss the back of her hand and call it her boyfriend she might be virtuous otherwise but you see in her heart when those glands sex glands are in the lips the man kisses a woman he's actually potentially committed a do ad Trey sex glands are in the woman's lips and in the man's lips he could kiss her on the hand it wouldn't mix through their sex gland But the Sex gland is in the lips so how many was engaged and went out and had another boyfriend or whatever or a girlfriend look what a situation it puts you in my wife can tell you in a hurry because I've told you about it many times we riding up the highway going to Lake Russell I believe and I told her I said I want to tell you my life I wasn't a Christian wasn't even a Baptist you know I didn't join the Baptist Church until after we were married but I said I want to tell you my life I said because I don't want no problems down the road I didn't know anything about the Bible and the prophet's message I was just a person that wanted to be honest I like to be honest and straight I've always told you how many of you want to make this statement I don't care for my wife knowing any thought I've ever had good or bad about her if she hears the finality of the thought I've had a lot of bad thoughts about a lot of you I won't mind you hearing them as long as you wait till the answer comes on the end of it cuz the answer comes on the end of it of me saying I love you you know brother Dale says that a lot right even converted churches to do that we went to one church and man they wouldn't even hug your neck and Bud way told me said Daddy don't tell them you love them not yet he said not yet you know what now they just hug each other and we just say I love you L people think boy he must be some kind of a yeah pervert he goes around tells you he loves you well I don't tell the women I love you now I do in my family but not to you women that's we love each other in the Lord but not right see okay bragging about yourself nope telling it like it is I tell it like it is I don't have to worry about it but the sex gland is in the lips and you go to kissing whether you're engaged or not all right now whether you're engaged or not and you go to kissing brother Brandon said we'll read it he said you ought not kiss that girl that woman until the day the veil is lifted sure we wouldn't talk these things where was anybody teaching anything like this back in organized religion don't talk about sex it's a bad word you don't even use that word right that's right like my wife always said about her mother if she'd have said sex in front of her mother she would have backhanded her in the mouth cuz that was taboo that's right see well now they're teaching sex in school if it was taught in the church and taught in the home it would have to be taught in school right the correct way but see what it would have been a potential adultery yeah so that puts us all in bad shape don't it that's right look what he says on the Oddball 1964 614 I'm sure going to have to read fter we ain't going to get on the grace this afternoon okay paragraph 50 51 it's almost a public adultery today right before for you I went to a certain place the other night to get something to eat and the little boys and girls up there hugging and kissing like I don't know what and do you know my little sister that that's potential an adultery when a man kisses you he has potentially committed adultery with you you should never let him kiss you until you're married why for the glands both male and female glands is in the lips do you understand and when male and female lands come together let it be where it may be you have potentially committed adultery and you shouldn't let a boy kiss you until that Veil is raised on your face and you're his wife don't do that it's committing adultery it's mixing male and female glands why don't a man kiss a man now we're in the perversion this was what 64 now had a picture in the paper the other day where one was kissing another one cuz they were okay in their same-sex marriages and things why don't a man kiss a man woman kiss a woman in the lips because it don't cross the glands children is born by Crossing glands right you know what Abby said here the other day she said Mama I figured this out 5 years old said you and Daddy got married said you kissed him he had a girl said that's me said I want y'all to get married again and him to kiss you cuz that'll bring a boy okay 5 years old don't you think they can't figure things out right that's right don't you think them kids there sitting over there they over there playing you know they're playing and they're really playing and oh they're not hearing a thing and you say that old preacher look what he done today he got the life and he cutting up and that kid sitting over there you know you hear every words you say you want Bible for it you remember in the Bible when the kids said about Elisha I said go up old bald head now where did they get that from Mama and Daddy sitting around the table saiding that baldheaded man thinks he knows everything and you know what happened don't you some sheers come out and killed 42 of the kids whose fault was it mama and daddy right okay one more the presence of God unrecognized 1964 uh 618 paragraph 116 when no man should ever kiss a woman until he is married to her that's male and female glands Crossing now I don't want to emphasize that so much but I wish we could dogs don't kiss oh I've seen my little doggy yeah because you been horses don't kisss so now there would be a way that if you want to say that Adam and Eve was made in a way that would bring about a lot of things not in the way that God made him to do wrong it's the way he made them that's male and female glands Crossing let it be whatever it may be it's wrong is potentially a sex act when male and female Grands touch it's a sex act and it's m and a man kiss a man in the mouth it would make him sick make him vomit or woman a woman why is it different it is it's a sex act potentially that's right and watch what it is we don't want to get messed up we want to be right it's a type of Christ kissing his bride now he's not kissing his bride until he's married to her so when he says you ought to be married before you kiss and he's typing Christ in the church Christ ain't running around slopping and kissing right so it puts all of us in bad shape don't it amen and we all need the grace of marriage and divorce I know of very few people that have ever said they didn't kiss a girl or a girl kiss a a boy until they married a very few and that's honorable and very respectable and very cherished because it's sweet and great you held yourself but the rest of us can't say that right right so it puts us in bad shape but AOW a vow let's hurry up and read something go over to numbers 30 let's read a little bit in the scripture and it says this is the things that the Lord hath commanded now we're only going to cover down so part and then we'll stop and then we'll go back and cover because this is not all together just talking about engagements it's talking about any vow you make and I'll prove it with the scriptures of what it's talking about so where that you'll follow that and won't lock off on me and run in a different direction if a man vow vow unto the Lord or SAR an oath to bind his soul with a bond he shall not break his word he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth you remember we we have time we'll get to it in Deuteronomy I believe it is where that the man vowed to vow that whatever come out of his house if God would allow him to defeat his enemy whatever came out of his house he would offer as a sacrifice when he got home his daughter the only daughter he had walked out he kept his word and sacrificed her as a sacrifice she volunteer done and said father keep your V now I'm glad God don't ask us sometimes to do things that he's had people to do that's right I wouldn't want to sacrifice none of my kids to any to God or whatever but you know he put it in there and it happened to where we should realize how much it is to vow vow how sacred it is to vow vow all right he's to keep it if a woman also vow vow unto the Lord and bind herself by a bond being in her father's house in her youth little young girl and a father hear her vow and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul and her father shall hold his peace at her then all her vows shall stand and every Bond where where she hath bound her soul shall stand says if he holds his Peace A lot of people uses this and you can use it it's fine but how do you use it they say I disallowed my daughter daughter's engagement to a boy how did you do it you didn't do it scripturally you just goofed up I proed down here in the Bible you're going to Bear her iniquity the Bible says it if you don't do it correctly and you do her wrong you bu you buar her iniquity the Bible says but see it can be used watch but if her father allow her in the day I've emphasized that and we'll prove the scripture says that in a second in the day that he heareth see what they do in the message now is they use that scripture and they say well well my daughter was engaged three times and I just allowed her every time I don't think that's right now are you sa my my daughter was engaged and we had the wedding planned and we made everything and we got everything ready and we put in the paper that was engaged but I decided to disallow it you're going to Bear her iniquity it says in the day now I want you to notice how many times it says day day day in other words the minute you hear it you separate that you don't wait 3 weeks and then decide to do it no is that the Bible back up read the other what was it and the father hear her vow and her vau where with sheath bound her soul and the father shall hold his peace he's got to say it in that day that he hears it but if he holds his peace then her vow shall stand and every Bond where with she hath bound her soul shall stand and we'll read down in a minute in about same scripture and he'll bear her iniquity okay just being plain no arguments no problems just being plain where we can see it but if the father disallow her in the day that he heareth not any of her vows or her bonds where with she ha bound her soul shall stand and the Lord shall forgive her because her father disallowed her now one of these days I'm going to get around and preach on Grace just a little bit before we get to this afternoon if your father don't disallow how are you going to get rid of anything right now that can be used about an engagement because it's talking about a vow that she makes when it says in her youth youth doesn't say a 40y old woman come on says in her youth you know what I'm talking about you know what the Bible's talking about little boys and girls now they just talk about when you grow up will you marry me well yeah I'll marry you and you know what they do a lot of times in in between there okay is that plain enough remember boys girls I'm not making a distinction boys guilty girls guilty no distinction it's not okay for him but wrong for her don't use the Bible wrong don't use the message wrong it's only okay for him if he's got grounds to make that okay that's where Jesus said he said because of the hardness of your heart in other words you were going to do it and you done it you wern't going to listen but listen showing you that this is not all just about getting engaged look what he said and if she had an had an all in husband when she vowed or uttered her oath out of her lips where she was bound her she bound her soul so you know hey if you're married you can't bind to marry somebody else right so it's not talking just about engagements is when you bind your soul with an oath in other words you give your word to do something you know kids go to churches and all like that and little bitty kid you know comes along and mama daddy they've been talking to us about being Miss missionaries and I want to be a missionary and I swore on an oath that I'd be a missionary you ought to get the kid and go down to the church and say hey quit trying to make these kids Swire these things cuz Bible says if you Swire you keep it you going to church where that they believe in giving the preacher all the money I'm just giving illustrations all right are you listening you go in a church where that they they pie The Collection plate and then they beat you to death because you didn't give so much then they pie it again they finally get you to vow how many of you was in organized religion we won't ask that question okay how many of you signed a pledge to pay you tithe come on am I right that's right the church wanted you to sign a pledge to give money if everybody give their tithe you didn't have to worry about the pledge we were talking about it last night sister trud I sat in the Deacon board and told that Deacon board I count the money that comes in upstairs cuz that's what I done that was my job to take it up and count it and give it to the treasur you know and I said there's more tithe due out of this Deacon board then it's coming in upstairs through the offering plate so you know I didn't play then and I was 23 years old this wasn't something I Was 80 years old we paid our tithe once we started and got to the place that we knew what it was we paid our tithe it come first absolutely but I can't afford to pay it you can't afford not to that's right amen that's right I don't care if you got to go borrow the money you can't afford not to pay you TI cuz you don't have no promise from God of a blessing you're robbing yourself go ahead amen right why are people in such Financial shape right that's right it's like I've told you and I mean it from the bottom of my heart if you want an oath on it I've said this many many many times here you pay tide one year sincerely out of your heart to honestly to God and you pay tith one year to this church not to me to this church and it comes in and we use that for God's honor and Glory at the end of the year if you're not better off I'll give you ever dime you paid that year back to you amen I've made that challenge that's as much sincerity as I think anybody could be then I'll give it back to you but you made a vow when you become a Christian that's right you made a vow that you would pay your tithe that's right you made a vow you'd live for the Lord that's what I'm talking about this is not talking about engagements right it's just vowing a vow you made a vow to be true to your husband to be true to your wife not going out slopping and kissing and doing all of those things you remember when Pat Boon wouldn't kiss a girl on the movie screen some of you ain't old enough maybe to remember those old days he wouldn't do it he was a Pentecostal but what's today now I'm not talking about him cuz that's none of my business what's today slopping and kissing around we'll get down to that a little later on when the prophet is talking about how that she can be justified be forgiven but never be justified that's an invisible Union okay let's hurry so it's not just talking about an engagement form it's talking about any vow that you make of proven it by her saying surely you wouldn't stand by and your wife say I'm going to vow be engaged to that guy I'm going to marry that guy over there now that's kind of uh off in the head right see that that's not just vowing the the marital part all right it can be used as that because she's a youth she's a young girl but if she's got a husband now watch if she's got a husband God deals with her differently okay if she had it all in husband when she vowed and uttered out out of her lips where where she bound her soul just like say I'm going to be a missionary no husband said I don't want you to be a missionary guess what I'm LED of the Lord I want to be a missionary I want to be a preacher but honey the Bible don't want you to be a preacher you be a missionary but how about being a missionary here at home first okay and her husband heard it now what she makes a vow a woman is married makes a vow and her husband hears it and held his peace in the day that he heard it then her vow shall stand and her bonds where with she bound her soul shall stand so if you girls go out and you or you women you go out and you say God leading me to get me a job and go to work and give all of my money to the missionaries i' say honey I don't think that's right oh I'm L of the Lord yeah but honey you realize what you're saying cuz if I don't say it in that day then her bond will SK and you know what she'll have to get a job and she'll have to pay it all to the missionary so you understand the husband has the right to say no that's right all right but if the husband disallowed her on that day and that he heard it not 20 years later or something then he shall make her vow which she vowed and that which she uttered with her lips where with she bound her soul of none effect and the Lord shall forgive her amen now if you don't see marriage and divorce and the grace of God that I'm reading here then you might as well go home this afternoon and forget it and don't watch it amen or don't ever view it because you're not going to get it right amen these are only what was it Tom used to tell Johny yeah but what was he used to say he said in the morning he preaches this way in the afternoon he gets with it right but watch now but every Widow valow a widow look how specific the church is Father Can disallow the daughter's vow husband can disallow the wife vow but ever vow of a widow and her that is divorced wherewith they have bound their souls shall stand against them why they don't have no head to take it away right they don't have a husband father Etc to be able to fall back on to take it away their headships gone cuz they're they're a widow are divorced now watch just repeating itself but making it comes to a very clear point but she vowed in her husband's house now not talking about the Widow this is a woman now that's married separate this verse from this cuz it's not and as she vowed in her husband's house or bound her soul by a bond with an oath and her husband heard it and held his peace at her he held his peace and disallowed her not in other words he didn't stop her vow then all her vows shall stand and every Bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand you say why is it repeating itself to where the rest of it will come into VI but if her husband ha utterly made them void on the day he heard them not 20 years later then whatsoever proceedeth out of her lips concerning her vows are concerning the bond and her soul shall not stand her husband hath made them void and the Lord shall forgive her amen okay amen ever vow and ever binding oath to afflict the soul her husband May establish it or her husband may make it void amen there's your grace of marriage and divorce we get to this evening not turn that scripture if you don't see it you you're just missing it but watch but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from the day to day in other words if he lingers it on like I said the girls have been the the the engagement party made and the boy and the girls engaged and done put it in the newspaper and then the daddy says I don't want her to marry him I'll just disallow that that can't be done because he's let it pass from day to day but the first day he hears it he says no brother brandom about Billy Paul what'd he do he said me and her daddy got together and aned a wedding but said Billy was married that's right y what but if her husband all together hold his peace at her from day to day then he establishes all her vows or all her bonds which are upon her he confir them because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them now but if he shall if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them now then he shall bear her iniquity now are you listening if he goes day to day if he lets it pass you know he learns of the vow and he makes it lets it pass whether it be an engagement whether it be a promise of somebody to be a missionary whether it be your vowed to give all the money you ever make to the Lord or you know there all kind of vows all kind of vows and vows all right but if he lets that go for a while then he comes up and decides to do it look what he does if he lets it Go day by day he lets it go and he doesn't stop her the day that he heard them but if he shall in any wise make them void after that he hath heard them right both of them's in trouble then he shall bear her iniquity MH all right are you following it these are the statutes which the Lord commanded Moses between a man and his wife between the father and his daughter being yet in her youth in her father's house plain enough isn't it if you vow a vow you got to keep the vow but your father if your youth in the house he can anull that vow and make it of none of for the day he hears it not 3 months later not 6 months later not two engagements on down the road he done away with number one where number two would be okay you say that's done forget it but ain't none of our business who does what it's what we do just getting the scriptures and laying them out but if he just turns around and and he just lets it go and then one of these days he Ides well I don't think that's right my wife vowed to give all get her a job and give all her money to to the Lord I don't think that's right see if he's done it and let it go for a while cuz he wanted the money to come in but then when he found out she was going to give it all away then he decides not to do it he can't stop her and he bues her iniquity if he's a man of decent sense then he'd help her pay what she vied right I said a man of decent sense not even Christianity you see how serious it is to V vial you see how serious it is to say you'll do something do you know that if one of our ambassadors from the United States goes over this happened back when I was in school they went to Russia when they were needing food and things back in the probably in the late 50s somewhere right in there and our ambassador vowed to give Russia a bunch of wheat you know we had to keep our word if our ambassador goes he's an ambassador to represent us if he goes over there to a country and he vows to give them millions of dollars we got to do it cuz he's our spokesman he's the person chose Chen to to do that don't vow to vow if you're not going to keep it did we read that for the prophet just don't vow it you know the Bible says don't say I'll be at your house tomorrow Bible don't say that it says for you not to say that what do you mean I'm coming to your house it says the Lord willing right see that means can go take place that you don't know about then you're not a liar that's of course if you call my house and tell me you're coming I've always told you please call me up and tell me you ain't coming because me and my wife had done clean the house change the beds and got ready for you to come so you could at least call and say I'm not coming right am cuz I just believe in being straight and honest you know Christianity didn't make me an honest person that's what we think Christianity didn't make me not lie and cheat and steal you know I said that and I said well I never never stole anything no bigger than watermelon but see that wasn't stealing right because the man knew was walking right behind his house go get the watermelon it wouldn't stealing he knew we was getting them he told us to go get what we needed long we didn't bust Us in the patch I didn't go steal nothing CU I never did believe in stealing as a sinner I used to come out of General Motors cuz I had a job that involved a lot of come on mus this that involved traveling I could leave outside the plant and go over into what was called a complete the shipping I could go over our and I had the okay from the supervision I could just go drive out there and take their own buggies and go work on cars and do things and I had a lot of times I had Carter keys in my pockets I had nuts and bolts wrenches in my pocket I would go out the door going home you know and I'd forget about it well that's put them over over there you you didn't steal them I took them back in the next day and I put them back where I got him from you think people don't steal the old days we used to have cover alls very rarely they get a brand new power cover HS and they'd we them out the gate to go eat dinner and they wouldn't come in back into that gate cuz the guard might catch them they go over to the other gate and they come back in without the cover alls on seen people steal take a chance you're losing a job stealing spark plugs out of a car a motor but you could lose a real wonderful job over some little stupid silly thing that you'd steal I'd take it back in put it back why because I didn't want it If we're honest to that one can't we be honest with God he expects us to keep his our word cuz he keeps his word you vow vow unto the Lord remember to keep the vow amen but don't make a dumb vow that's what I said when you got to tell children and get them to vow to try to remain what is the word f celebrate is that the word how you pronounce that word in other words remain not active with boys and girls you mean you got to make people violent you got to make Christians do that but I will end it with one thing when you the day you took a vow either whether it was in front of a judge or whether it was what you take this woman to be your lawfully weighted wife take this man to be your lawfully husband said you say yes the Bible says until death do you part is what it ought to be said the prophet said that was what took out of it anyway may not be the wording you know but then we go out and slopping around and kissing around dating and things how can we ever expect God to save us what about it let's understand vow a vow a kiss is a potential adultery what about it how can we expect God to bring us Grace if we can't keep his word straight now we'll try to get to it this afternoon if we have time brother randam he's said I had the scriptures on marriage and divorce but he didn't have the grace that was given he knew that there was a possibility because he'll say it he'll say remain as you are because things have been done before you know but he couldn't come out there and say what he said on the grace of marriage and divorce even just because he knew the scriptures he said I had the scriptures on it he said it bust every Church in the world he had the scriptures but he waited the Lord told him almost a year before he preached it preach that and lay it aside we waited until God spoke to him about the grace he waited we waited nine sermons trying to get everything laid in order by the scriptures where we can talk about Grace and not make it disgrace make it to truth what about it what about we got
