to send you some encouragement and and that night I went I went to work and um it was a clip of brother uh of a pastor preaching and he said uh sometime God allows conditions to come in your life just to see if You' be crazy enough to believe that he'll heal you from it and and of course y'all know me I'm I'm I I love saying that God is going to do something Supernatural but not believing it at

were praying for a daughter and it just wasn't working out wasn't working out and we got so low to the point to where we both got depressed and broke down and um one day that one day it got really

that's why we're here this morning amen amen we come to see the Lord Jesus amen I think I got that on Amen we'll see anyways I'm reminded of something I believe it the white Moody if I'm not mistaken said a reporter or somebody came out to see him when he was speaking and uh and went back and wrote his article and told him he said I don't know why anybody would want to go see that Dwight Moody he said he's un I forget all the terms pretty much he was country you couldn't understand him he was UNC and this and that he wasn't educated and all these things and they brought the paper in and showed showed Dwight and they said you what do you think about that he just laughed he said well of course not they didn't come to see me they came to see Jesus right that's right amen amen we want to see him amen that's right that's what it's all about brother amen amen just to say the Lord Jesus Christ you know there there's there's a greater need for Jesus Christ right now than there has ever been in the world before this world isn't a sarer come up a little bit this world is in a sarer state than it has ever been that's good I got the thumbs up back there I think we all right amen but we got Jesus so praise the lord we got Jesus do you love him this morning amen I'm going to say more morning while I can still say this morning amen and uh brother brother Wade was so gracious to to remind me of something that brother Dan daisley said he said if you sing for an hour and a half I'm going to preach for an hour and a half am you didn't quite make an hour and a half so we'll just go with that anyways but uh anyways it is good to be in church this morning amen it is wonderful to be in the house of the Lord this morning I really had a good time last night I really did it was a a full a full and a fun evening for sure amen and uh we we made it back to the room with no problems last night even in that cold rain and it's got colder as the day went on got a little rest I feel bad for the for the ministers here though I I just can imagine that that after that last game you probably had to stick around to pass midnight in the counseling sessions and everything else there's just nothing like seeing a man when they say youo who who does your wife say you are Prince Charming goofy sleepy and Dopey the men are all like Prince Charm and were like goofy goofy dopy Dopey sleepy anything but Prince Charm man the look that comes over those faces at that time oh my goodness gracious it's Priceless you know really you know but I told April when all this was going on brother way I said you know I said I'm reminded of what Jesus said he said when you go to the feast don't begin to take the seat that's the highest L they come and put you down low right so you want to put yourself low and let them bring you back up high amen so I chose goofy but I was wrong she said sleepy amen I still W I still wanting the the prince charming by no means but sleepy is a little bit better than goofy I'll take that amen anyways it was it we really had a good time really really had a good time amen and U also I want to tell you that you know I got to be honest and tell you that brother Wade told me to take as long as I like right as long as I like this morning and uh that that usually goes to mean means long you know that translates to long with me but I'm going to try my best not to amen and uh maybe I should just cut it short and let's just have prayer meeting this morning yeah anyways or something like that but anyways seriously we did have a good time amen and U again I just want to thank brother W uh brother West I almost said brother West brother Wade I got the W right anyways I want to thank you brother Wade for for the for the invite again amen it has been a wonderful weekend looking forward to this morning here and um thank you guys for for everything brother Bob I really enjoyed the that that this morning I got in kind of late so forgive me for that but that's the truth we got to go beyond this old Noggin here we got to we got to go to where we can get a hold of a true Revelation right amen a substance Revelation this morning and the truth that's what sets us free and I say that because I also want to thank you guys for for praying for us with the the many needs that we send out via the text and the email um I know several of you guys get those and um we're all a part of the family of God you know amen I think the old saying is the family that prays together stays together right and man we got eternity together so praise the Lord

I'm going to turn back to the Book of Genesis we're going to go back to the Book of Genesis and for those of you who were not at last night's coup's banquet there I say back because I read from Genesis last night too um this is just such an awesome portion of scripture really here and U God puts everything in its proper order right if you want to know what the proper order for God for God is go back to Genesis and look at it he shows you exactly what it is he puts everything in his proper order there Mercy Me ain't that what this world needs today you know it needs to be it needs some order to things we need order to things here you know we we've sang this song for years I believe it's like this world is falling apart you tell I'm not a singer I'm so glad I got Jesus down in my heart is that right and that's the truth this world is falling apart but you know what we can look around now to today more than ever you know and before I used to love to sing that song I can sing it better when I'm in my truck by myself that's right and and you know I used to love to sing that song and we we go through those things you think man it is everything's falling apart but you know the day that we're in right now we look at these things we think man it's shot you know I mean it's not just it is falling apart it has fallen apart right we look around now no matter where you look at you no matter what you Turn Your Eyes Upon it has already fallen apart the politics are gone the education system's gone the medical system is gone the supply chains are broken right the minds of the people are broken the spirits of the people are broken that's even worse it takes a 399 thou no $399,500 missile flying out of a $216 million jet to bust a balloon I mean come on you know they they they need to go see the mccullas down in M down in down in mon we'd go down to their birthday parties they'd let balloons loose and we'd all be sitting there go boom boom boom and blowing those balloons out you know with whatever you have they've shot more balloons down than the guess this government's ever done you know it was kind of exciting to watch it kind of go across the country though it was almost the most fun I've had since the OJ Simpson chase you know some of you are too too young to get that some of us are too old to remember it good grief amen that's the state of things anyways I think we could stand a good old dose of uh God ordained order in this this time right now amen so anyways Genesis chapter 2 don't worry I'm not going to try to put everything back in order here this morning that would really take a long time here amen but um hey just be sure though that the answers that put it all back in order in those those those good old books you're holding in your hands right there right it's in those Bibles amen but I just thought again since this weekend you I'm not going to try to do it all at one time but I just thought since this weekend is uh you know was the couples back with and Tuesday is the holiday this this honoring some naked baby with wings doing flybys and shooting arrows you know and everything maybe I just take a thought this morning from Genesis where God put everything in place for the man and the woman you know the man and the woman here the man and his wife and the woman or husband and don't worry brother Wade I'm not going to blow it up so bad that you got to put everything back together I pray amen if I do then I won't never be back but I don't want to make brother Wade mad cuz he's got to come back and preach for us again yeah I know I know so I'm going to title this as has already been up there for a while they twain shall be one before we read our scripture let's bow our heads right quick Heavenly Father dear God we love you this morning we love you with everything that we have in our hearts our hearts are full this morning dear God when we think of the goodness and the grace and the faithfulness Lord we think of the promises that you've give us Lord the prayers that have been answered dear Lord Jesus and most of all dear God we think of the faith and the stand of the people here they couldn't do that if it were not for the Holy Ghost so Lord we just pray this morning that you would just that you would come amongst us Lord you're already here Lord but I pray that you would just just move amongst us in such a way dear God to to to speak to our hearts to encourage us and help us Lord to to do whatever needs to be done to do the Greater Works dear God that you promis that you would do Lord Lord we thank you we pray that you take these words that I have Lord open them to our hearts Lord take the thoughts that are Upon My Heart Lord Jesus dear God and just deliver it in whichever way would seem pleasing to you let you speak Lord in Jesus name we pray amen Genesis chapter 2 verse 21 and the Lord C the Lord God calls the Deep Sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and here we see the great physician performed the world's first operation right the first surgery amen so verse 22 and the rib which the Lord God had taken from the man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and they were not ashamed amen God bless you you may be seated here this morning amen so I want to start out just by looking at the uh looking at this scripture and looking at the the woman that came out of Adam or like I like to say sometime looking at the wo man that came out of Adam right I got in trouble for saying it that way one time years ago but the woe man that came out of Adam Adam who is the spoken word Son of God right we know that that's true and and I say that he is the spoken word Son of God because Adam is eternal amen right he's Eternal Adam was the first Earth the first Earth and vessel to have been filled with eternal life when this world was formed he is the first vessel flesh and blood vessel to have been filled with the Holy Ghost amen amen praise the Lord and the Bible tells us in Genesis chapter 2 that the Lord God formed his body Out of the Dust right and then he breathed the Breath of Life Y into his nostrils and he became a living Soul right amen Adam was not even called Adam until Genesis 2 when he was formed out of the the dust which means red Ruddy you know that sort of thing it was a man that was there and that that vessel that vessel became the the the the the the holding Place amen it became the dwelling place for the life of God for the Breath of God that word breath there when you you break it down is a very simple word it means to to blow or to be blown is to cause to breathe out and also to give up life God gave up life listen to this now that don't mean that he get away with his life but he gave up life in order to be able to breathe it into the nostrils of Adam look at what he's done for you today look at the breath that he's put in you today for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son right amen and he said he he breathed upon them right receive ye the Holy Ghost amen and so that's what that's what the word there literally to breathe means amen so so so you know God breathed he he literally breathed into into the nostrils into this vessel he he blowed his breath into that don't tell me God's not real he's got breath right he's got breath he can breathe yes there must be some lungs or something that can squish some breath out some way or another there was something that was that was placed into this into this vessel that we'd call Adam here bu correct and by the way again that word used for Life there he breathed the breath of life that word for used for Life there is the same word that God uses just two verses below there in verse n it's the very same word that he uses there when he first speaks of the Tree of Life the first mention the first idea the first concept that Humanity has of something called the the tree of life amen and he takes that same life and he breathes it into that spoken word Son of [Music] God good y same life y same life that was flowing through the tree life amen and we know who that tree of life is Jesus Christ is that tree of life Christ amen God and that same life that flowed through the Tree of Life In The Garden it's the same life which the Lord God breathed into Adam and then and that flesh and blood formation from the dust of the earth became a living soul he was an eternal Soul which came forth from the life source of God himself the same Life Source who is he he's the word amen and Adam's a spoken word Son of God and that same spoken word Son of God or seed of God that was spoken Genesis 1 he placed there God said in Genesis 1: 26 and 27 and God said let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created him in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them is that right and in the day that God created man in Genesis 1 in the day that God created man he created him male and and female and they were created as we said last night as one unit one unit he was male she was female that's right and they were one and there was no such thing as a woan at the time of Genesis one that's right until she came out of Adam and then when she came out of Adam oh boy we got got a lot of Woe oh I'm going to get in [Music] trouble but hold on trust me here I'm not trust me I'm not a card carrying member of the He-Man Woman Haters Club I am not you can ask my wife you know when we first got married we first got married oh my there's a lot of good stories I think I think she left she has left the building when we first got married we you know actually let me back up even before we got married we were uh we were just dating I think we were already we were already engaged and uh we were you know had our Whirlwind engagement and everything else and we're already engaged and we we went and I went and and visited we were going in in and visiting with her sister her sister was married a couple years before we were and her brother was married just like five months before we were so we were all pretty much learning at the same time you know and again it's all about this concept of unity of of they twain shall be one right so so we go and and we sit down and and I I was just raising a little Methodist boy as I said last night I was just raising a little Methodist boy that went to church maybe two or three times every three or four years you know that's that's kind of how we did and and you know you just you're we were just out there and and but but you know there was something in my heart that God had been pulling along right and and and my wife as I said last night again she was my in she was the one that witnessed to me and and gave me the opportunity to to hear the voice of God Amen and I I give all the credit for that like I said again last night but but you know we were sitting there uhoh she come back in I am in trouble so Sister Jude say yeah you are so we're sitting there in her sister my sister-in-law's house and we're sitting there and and and you know again this little Methodist boy that didn't know anything about anything hardly I'd been going to church for a little while and and uh and I said you know I asked Lisa I said well Sister Lisa do you have do you have a Coke or something I can you know I could drink I'm kind of thirsty would you have you know something and so and she said yeah it's in the refrigerator and I'll get it and I said no no no I I'll get it you know I I'll get it myself I wasn't raised to let somebody do things that way I was going to go get it now it was her kitchen I will say that but but so she said no no no I'll get it I'll get it and I said no no Lisa I'll get it and you you don't have to do that you we we're all just having a good time and she looked at me and I'll never forget it she looked at means she said Dutch and and in the way that we believe the woman Waits on the man I was like Whoa man you know that's that's pretty awesome right and and she got up and she fixed me a Coke and listen I'm not even her husband but she fixed me a Coke and she gave me you know the glass of Coke and and we sat there and we had a good time it wasn't long after that April done closing her eyes here but it wasn't long after that we were married like that I said I'd like to have something this and and she said you got two legs right oh I am so much [Laughter] trouble but you know I learned real fast it has to be a Unity right there got to be a Unity it's not one way or another we had to learn you know that as a family we came together and we had to learn and this was a lesson for some maybe some of the younger ones here I don't know I see a lot of young faces here this morning you know perhaps you're thinking you know you're you're as you you get up in teenage years and everything else you began to chafe it the bit as it were you know I'm my only I'm a man right or I'm a woman and and I can you I'm grown I'm all of 13 years old and I don't know what it is where that switch was but I remember when my girls turned 13 the day they turned 13 somehow between the night when we went to bed they were 12 years old and the morning when we woke up and they were 13 somebody slipped in my house and they found a switch that I never could find and they flipped that switch and it was like the invasions of the Body Snatchers came in and they took my 12-year-old girls and they Place something there I don't know what it was and man they were grown yeah you're not going to tell me what to do you know it's lessons that you learn amen right but as you're young the younger ones that are here and everything else don't get this idea in your head that you're going to listen I'm going to go out I'm going to be I'm going to get married and and and nobody's is going to tell me what to do and and we're it's everything's going to be easy and everything's going to be wonderful and and you know I'm going to get to eat all the ice cream that I want be careful you'll get a figure like mine if you do that I want get to do all these things like that but you know the thing of it is when we when we got together when we began dating and we we got you know we finally got married and everything else we I found that you know that it's one thing when you're when you're one in individual living under your parents' house and you got you you you know the rules you might Buck the rules but you know the rules right you know what they are and they're there for a reason they are it there's an order to things and it has to go a certain way right it has to go a certain way or there's chaos and God is not the author of chaos so if what you're thinking and what you're going through is bringing chaos and everything in you need to realize listen this might not be from God God might not might not mean for me to go out and be a full grown man when I'm 13 years old right he might not mean for me to be a full grown woman when I'm 13 years old right amen yeah but there's an order yeah there's an order that's taking place and after we you know when we came up we one thing I found was again we were taking a I was taking my life my my life that had been raised up under my mom and dad and there was an order to things and and you know regardless whether I enjoyed all that order or not it was there yeah but then but then you know then I I come and I again I I'm the the the girl of my dreams and and we get married and but you know what she was raised up that's that that in order too it was a different order than what my order was and the challenge was bringing these two lives together in such a way that it could produce something Godly and beautiful right useful something that has a purpose to it right amen because you see God always has a purpose if God's going to do something in your life there's a purpose for it right if you're going whatever it is that you're going through right now there's a purpose for it I know that's hard to say sometimes when we look in the pain and the hurt and the uncertainty and and life is you know life is it's not just rough life is terrible sometimes it's brutal right don't seem like there's an answer it seems like it's full of chaos and pain and hurt and Terror and all the different things like that but I just want you to kind of step back and just realize that God is in control he is in control and there is a purpose he's actually bringing about an order to things right an order and as Christians we want God's order amen right because we realize that God's will is best right God knows best God knows best amen sir and when it's his time for me to get out of here when it's his time when he's done with me that I'm ready for my my purpose is over I'm ready to go right I want to fulfill his purpose and I want to go home but again I remember going through these things and and trying to put all these things together and come under you know try to try to put things in in in order and a seeming order that's there it's hard to do that amen yeah you need the Lord you need the Holy Ghost this it's hard to do that sometimes it's really really hard to do that sometimes you know I I can imagine as I was trying or I don't have to imagine but I remember when we were trying to to get things together before we were you we were just fixing to be engaged we were just dating and everything else and I remember you know what the order I was seeing was that I was going to marry this beautiful lady and that we were going to go off into the sunset and and it was going to be wonderful right there's not going to be any anything was going to stand in our way hey the the sky's the limit right now I was working at a plant making like $200 a week and after we paid you after I paid everything I didn't have money for nothing but man it was going to be wonderful right but there was a hurdle I had to pass I had to get over and that hurdle was her dad amen and and I remember I remember going and and saying you know what I've got to ask for her hand in marriage I was just oldfashioned enough to think that you still need to ask permission right so I walked up you know one morning I got up she wasn't there I got up and we'd already discussed that I was going to talk to her dad and she was going to talk to her her mom cuz I was more scared of her mom than I was her dad still am in a lot of ways but I remember I got up early and you know I worked second shift but I got up early one morning and I it was a hot summer day and and I I drove over to their house and I get out April's not even you I'm not even seen her yet or anything wouldn't see her for the rest of the day after what I was about to do and and I so I go up you I get out of the truck my old truck and I walk up there and her dad I don't know if you know some of you know him some of you you don't he he was about he was in his early 40s I think at the time and he was a man and I was not he was a mechanic he had these big old Popeye arms you know and he was muscles he could pick up a a 350 and walk with it I mean the dude was a he was a h he still is he's in better shape now than I've ever been in my life my shape is round he's still got he's still got a trim figure I don't know how he does it my wife's got good jeans yeah so I step out of the truck and the first thing he comes out of the shop and it's hot and he don't have his shirt on cuz he's working you know in the shop at home and and there's nobody around and it's hot and he's all sweaty and those muscles are huge and I get to look in at those hands I mean if you ever you know mechanic's hands they're not like a normal person's hands mechanics and and concrete workers do not mess with those two individuals right I mean they got hands that could ring the bell on the whole world at one time I don't know what it is but and I walked up to him and I said I said well I said I'm I'm here sir I'm I'm here I'm going to I'm going to I I need to I need to ask you something and he just looking at me like what is wrong with you boy and I said I I I I want to I want to ask for for your your daughter's hand in marriage I want to marry April and he he just kind of stands there and the only word that comes out of his mouth is Mercy looking back I think he was praying that God would have mercy on me cuz he knew what he wanted to do right and he didn't say nothing else he didn't say anything else so I said finally I said now that I have Rend your day I'm going to get back in my truck and go home that's what I said I'm going to get back in my truck can go home and all he said I think it would be best and I high tailed it back to that truck and I'm no and I'm down the road April it's your turn you got to go talk to your mama right but as I said last night I was persistent you know and and we we kept the course and and we finally we were married right we were married and I thought that was a big hurdle it was at the time but that was nothing to what was coming putting two pieces together we put our two little pieces together and her her brother and her sister and their their wives and their husband they put their two little pieces together and then we tried to bring this whole family so now we had three or four families all coming together man you talk about some some hot nights on the back of the desert you know brother brother brandom said Moses back there and his wife a hot-headed wife not saying my wife is hotheaded don't take that wrong that came out wrong but just trying to put things together and make it work it was hard to do but I want to tell you worth it am that's right 34 years and 3 months today right right Bud we made it we made it I'm so glad that we make it amen there's a lot of work that goes in these things to bring two into into one and one relationship one bonding one they twain shall be one and you put these two things together and boy the fun times are on buddy right right tough times Rough Waters decisions lots of discussions sometimes they get you know the voices get up a little bit Sometimes they come down a little bit sometimes this you know we we get these things and we we put all this together and we call it this wonderful institution of marriage right yeah and you know what it is wonderful it really is it's wonderful in the good times there's nothing like it when everything's going right right but you know what there's also definitely definitely nothing like it when things are not going right either amen and the Lord can bless that relationship yeah amen right 34 34 years of 3 months my goodness is gracious we used to come we one of the lesson we used to have we used to come to a place and and us us people us men of the the Tatum Clan would joke and we'd say woman get in your place you talk about for a smooth and righteous selling that'll do it every time right and we were kidding we really were kidding but there's nothing like that does the the the alarms start going off the blaring and everything all hands on deck Iceberg directly ahead but we survive these things and again I then I think that the success of our marriage has to do with us both it takes both one one cannot do it alone you brothers sitting here this this morning you need to be the husband that God meant for you to be I'm going to tell you a little bit here how to do that just just in a little bit if this is okay but you need to be the husband that she needs you to be you're the one that said I do right you did that's right amen play time's over right and sisters you got to be the wife that he needs you to be that God meant for you to be right not just that he wants you to be because sometimes us men we're stupid and we don't know what's best but you know God has a way and you as sisters you have a wisdom about you that sometimes a whole lot more than the men do about what needs to be done or what needs to be said I loved it last night one of the questions wait a minute I was told that what happened there was supposed to stay there well I'm going to anyways but I love I loved it one of the questions there was who who who is the more decisive one I'm just going to go ahead and say it probably seven eight almost every one of them in there was saying her her her her I did too her he think my goodness these VY women no it's God puts a wi God put a wisdom in you right it takes both to work together right and God's able to do that and do that in such a way that the marriage works now I'm not telling you to be bossy women don't get me wrong but but you know the thing God puts this thing together so that it works amen and God God needs you to be the wife that God meant for you to be and sometimes it's to stand there and to make a decision and say you know what we need to pray more about this maybe we need to pray more about this when the husband gets all excited about something we're going to go do this and we're going to go do that or I want this and I want that maybe the wife is the one that stands up and says whoa whoa right or it might be vice versa it could be the other way too and the woman but the the the point I'm trying to make is that you need to be that spouse that God meant for you to be he gave us the order through his word they twain shall be one it takes one unit to make this thing work work because if we if we go in too many times you know I used to work for my parents they had a they had a grocery store they had a convenience store sorry a convenient store with the gas pumps out front and these were you this was the days when there was no such thing as self-pay I know some of you have never even lived in times when there was no self-pay it was all now I was old we I am young enough to say that the full service gas stations were almost gone at that time yeah do you know there's places in the US you can go where they they have to be full State yeah they have to it's against the law for you to pump your own gas newy New Jersey that's right I got out of there as fast as I could but you would where was I going with that good grief but your mom and daddy owned aeni they did they did Brother way they owned a convenience store and one thing I would see preach brother Wade one thing I would see is the people would come in you this then they would come in they' go up and you'd have your cars come in from two different directions and one pull up this side of the station the gas pumps and this and pull up over here and the same gas pumps you know you got gas nozzles on both sides and they pull up like this and and so so the the the man would get out and he'd get his his put it in the tank and he's sitting there before cell phones too so you know they w't sitting here doing this number right that's what you do now right everybody gets out when they're pumping gas they're doing this number when they're waiting in the line they're doing this number they're going down the road they're doing this number or whatever and but they would sit there before that they would sit there at that tank and he would sit there and just kind of like and the wife and if you didn't know him you didn't know it was the wife but the the wife would be here on her car over here on this side facing him because you know they're they're like this so she's facing him going and it wasn't just they were mad it wasn't that they were mad you can tell when they get mad right you can tell when your spouse is mad and you can tell when somebody else's spouse is mad woo no that look yeah right but they you there was no it was like there was no commun there not even just no communication it's like they never they didn't even really know each other there was no relationship there there was nothing and they would put their gas their their nozzles back in the you know the tank when they're done and they'd come into the store one would walk behind the other just like strangers and they would come in there and they would wait in the line just like this he'd fiddle with something on the counter she'd fiddle with something over there he'd come up there he'd break his wallet out and he'd pay for the gas and he turned around he'd walk out turn around and walk right past her and never even look at her and she would come up there and she would pay for her guest like that and she would turn around and follow him right out the door they would get in their cars and plop separate ways and I'd sit there and I'm thinking they're married they're married right I didn't even know there was a scripture at the time saying that they twain shall be one I didn't know that I had never read that at that time but I knew something was off woo wouldn't you like to be in that house tonight no you talk about an iceberg right but there was something that was missing and I tell you what that's something that's missing and it's still missing for so many today is that it's that ability to let go of yourself to die to yourself and become one and become one this is kind of practical stuff we're talking about Valentine's Day right so it's a it's that ability to become one because without it the Rel reltionship does does not work absolutely the secret to a good marriage is first it takes both amen and the main secret to that is that both must know their positions in the one body right that is who God created us to be the one body he created us to be one and I don't I'm not just you know I'm not I don't I'm not taking that figuratively there it's a matter of speech no he said so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he them male and female created he them and if you think there's two of them there just go over and read in Revel Revelation where' that come from Genesis and Revelation just go over and read in Genesis chapter 2 when God created Adam where we just read and he created him out of the Dust of the earth there was still just one you and you could only see one but there were two in that one right they were so much there were there was so much of two in that one right that God had to put Adam into a sleep and sleep he did and then reach into his side I wonder how' he cut him open probably just just thinking way he just spoke God's light maybe he used laser surgery I don't know but ever how it was he reached inside and he took a rib out of his side and he closed up the flesh thereof right there were so much there was two in that one so much so that God could literally reach inside of him and pull the woman out amen come on brother that's right it's an amazing thing it is an amazing thing amen amen and she became Wan yeah right she became woman right she became woman they were created one then God separated them but I want you to notice is before the fall now I want you to notice something though that that even though with the rib being removed from his side from that there there was a separation that took place between the male and the female there but I want to just point out again that separation did nothing to negate the truth that they were created one in the very beginning they had to be one there's a purpose for me saying this this morning there has to be that Union take place there's got to be a Oneness take place still amazed you when I was when I first came into this message I remember reading a a sermon having questions about the Trinity and the godhead and all these things I may have said this here I say it a lot but but I remember you know what I wanted to understand what the godhead was I wanted to understand these things and you know I came from a trinitarian background but now here here we are in the message and brother Brown's talking about Oneness and everybody's talking about Oneness and I was just baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not in the father son Holy Ghost right and I'm all these things come together and I believe that don't get me wrong I believe that I believe what my pastor told me I believe what I read in the books I believe what the Bible said but you know you always you you just you w't understand right and then I I I get this this this sermon I pull up a book this was before the computer days and I pulled up I found a book Oneness and I thought yes that's going to show me everything I need to know about that and I open up and I start reading y right and I was floored flocked yeah wiped I don't know what you call it just just shot he was not talking about the Trinity near nearly so much as he was talking about the Oneness between the bride and her husband Jesus Christ the oness of the godhead and he was taking me and he was putting me in that godhead and I thought Lord have mercy what have I missed my whole life right what have I missed and I could look at it I could say this is awesome this is wonderful stuff right right so so when Adam and Eve when they're separated at that time remember now before the fall that they were still it did nothing that separation did nothing to negate the truth that they were created one in the beginning that was still there that Oneness was the truth according to God's word and I'm just going to go ahead and tell you this morning I might get out there just a little bit here in a second but I really believe that oness still exists right and for true happiness in the in in in the marriage you must find that Unity again amen you've got to come back to that Genesis 1 Unity right right Genesis 2:24 therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh Jesus said in Matthew chapter 19 have you not read that he which made made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let no man put a under right I think the problem today and we see it all over it used to be the problem that you would see outside the message ranks but we see it a lot in the message ranks now too but I think the problem today that we see way too too many times is that there are far too many marriages that have never truly be join been joined together I don't care what the preacher said I don't care how long the honeymoon was they have never joined together the two remain two separate individuals right through the fall that's what happened they were they before the fall they were they were they were Twain amen after the fall there came a separation there was sin separated there now praise the Lord God's able to heal things God's able to put stuff back together God's able to fix marriages God's able to to blend a relationship back together amen if he was not able to do that i g I guarantee you it would be a much worse world than it is right now thank God for True Christians and can stand up for a word of God Amen but the problem is is that people have not joined together they've not really United they they've remained two individuals instead of coming together as that one that God saw and spoke them to be before the foundation of the world and the woman has a hard time coming under the headship of the man right brother and losing her own fleshly identity and truly taking on his name his identity right right now I don't know you folks some of you folks and if I say something it might kind of step on your toes I'm sorry here but one of the things that just gripes me to no in is to see these new fangled marriages yeah where the where the woman will not take the man's name or it's a hyphenated name yeah call me oldfashioned I don't care I'm old enough to not care right if she's not if she's if she's holding on to enough identity of from her past life she can that that she will not surrender her last name then she is not she is not going to join she's not going to be able to ad adequately join this is just practical stuff brother wait I'm sorry but it's just you're not going to be able to just ad adequately that's a tongue twister if you've got a tongue from plain adequately join together amen and be the kind of husband or wife that you're supposed to be I was told a while back said well you know in some places overseas the man takes the wife's wife's name and it's true and I said but they ain't Christian right and I don't care if they do or they don't or whatever I don't identify with that I identify with the Bible I identify as a Christian I'm a Christian it's not even an American thing or a western thing or this thing or that I'm a chrisan it's a Bible thing and the woman is supposed to yield up surrender her identity to her her husband it's called headship right and the problem is is that they don't that the Lots will not come under that headship now I'm not just talking about the women because the problem I see too is the men will go many times and they will not yield up their identity you say wait a minute I'm the man I'm in control listen he took her took the rib out of the side yeah not the bone out of the foot right well she's got to do what I say she won't with that attitude no or if she does you better watch out there's going to be something in your food and you got to go to sleep sometime right say oh she's so Meek and timid she would never do something like that you'd be surprised humans are ingenious things they'll figure out a way to get you back right just smile all along yes my Lord yes my Lord oh my it's a it's a lack of ability to I tell you what it is is selfishness I mean just be plain spoken it's selfishness you know I know in 2023 that sounds like an outdated narrow-minded hateful position to take but it's the truth times have changed but the word of God has not amen I guess there could be many reasons there's really there there's a lot of reasons for this lack of unity there you know the fear of losing one's individual identities as we said I'm my own person but what Satan hides here and he's really good at hiding things but what Satan hides here is the fact that neither the man nor the woman can ever truly know their God given their full god-given identities and Freedoms because man there is nothing like the freedom that comes with having the right kind of relationship with your wife or your husband there's nothing like the freedom that comes with that I can go home and I can just open myself up I can unburden myself from the day not that I just want to go dump on my wife at the end of the day I don't do that but at the same time I'm able to talk about open up share my feelings share my love everything else and it's just it's a freeing thing if I had to carry everything by myself I would be a miserable human being and to be honest with you I don't think I'm strong enough to carry it all by myself I don't think I am I think I'd be so overwhelmed and listen guys do not take your wife for granted God give you the best thing he could give you outside of Salvation when he gave you a wife right a Godly wife don't take it for granted Satan is so good at hiding that though and saying well you know you're you're going to if you do that if you if you have that attitude or if you think about it this way if you you know whatever it might be if you go by the word of God if you do this you're you're not going to even be a person anymore he robs them of that blessing of they twain shall be One Robs him of it I mean he just reaches down there and snatches it right out of himen too many times he put a line in such a way that they can they'll just freely give it over right but God said he made you male and female he made you one yes now I'm talking about marriage here obviously I'm talking about marriage here this morning and I know according to to Paul that marriage is not for everyone he he did say that he plainly said that in his opinion it was better if you stayed as he was right as he was but then he turned around and said but not many can do that and it's better to marry than to burn that's not the reason you get married but it's better to marry than to burn the problem though again is that they never they never truly the problem is they never truly die to themselves and their their seal their selfish natures and all these things in order to advance the cause and the purpose of the family unit the family unit must come first there must be a true Union take place where everything to work right and again that so far here I've been just talking about marriage relationships but it's not just the natural marriage relationship here but this is a type of our relationship with our husband with the Lord Jesus Christ right we are his bride and through the marriage Union of the baptism of the Holy Ghost for this day through the bonds of holy matrimony to the Lord Jesus Christ we have become wife amen wife Amen in every sense of the word yes Ephesians 5: 22 says wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord have your way Lord right amen for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything husbands love your wives I pointed out last night that word love there that's a special word that word there husband love your wives That's not the Greek word Eros which is a lustful word it's the low one of the lowest form but the lowest form of love that there can be EOS and he did not say husbands filo your wives That's to have an affection for your wife you know I kind of like her yeah she cooks really good since I've been married I put on 80 pounds my wife can cook she gets it from her Mama honey I fly ow you I love how it feels to sit up pull up the to the table and be able to you just just eat to you know my heart's content I have affection for you you're so pretty you know and all that may be trueth there's nothing wrong with that that that's true but that's not what what God is commanding us here that's not what Jesus is saying he's saying husband loves your wife and it's the word it's the Greek word agapo yes I'm probably not putting enough o to that or o or something to that but agapo that's my Plainville Greek and agapo means according to the prophet he said it's not filio he said we're talking about the love of God right so husbands agapo your wives love her just as Christ loves his church and I'll tell you what that love is like that love is so great that he went to the cross and threw out his hands amen and he said nevertheless nevertheless God not my will but thy will be done you see agape love which is the identifying characteristic for the age you're living and remember if you go through the statue of the T of the the the perfect man you go there to up to the top there's the Capstone that comes down and brother Bram said it was love right love there love Yeah there holy Spirit that's the bonds of matrimony and The Headstone comes down and that's the identifying factor for our age love agapo love husbands love your wives that way yes love your wives like God loves you yes surrender everything to her amen give your very Life Force to her right right every everything you are I go to work I'm working for my family right I go to I go to church I'm I'm praying for my family I go whatever it might be there's something that's taking place and oh God I got to something's got to move and I'm praying for my family and all these things as the love of God I'm sacrificing everything I am for that one for that family unit abolutely for that family unit love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave him so for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without BL blemish I love going places with my wife right yes she stands out Y and I love it I'm presenting her as a glorious bride right and I'm so thankful for the privilege to be able to do that don't you know that when you walk the streets when you go to Walmart I used to say you I used to say all the time when you go through that Walmart cashier and you and every they don't have those anymore right now you're just in this big thing and you're having to do it all yourself that's right and then they got the audacity to check you out when you get you to make sure you did it right when you get to the door listen bub if you're not going to pay somebody to check me out don't look at my bags when I walk out the door you trust me trust me but don't you know when you walk through Walmart or HomeGoods or C or whever it is that you like to shop we heard a lot of that last night even Amazon somehow I ain't figured that one out see I'm old school still yeah I'm afraid if I order through Amazon it ain't going to fit yeah you know I'm not going to like it I ordered a kit one time on Amazon it was a Lego kit it was a it was a it was a wall you remember back in 2029 whatever it was and the Trump's thing was build the wall and everybody well everybody yeah yeah yeah you know all this kind of stuff and I did it as a joke with a little a little party gift to give to to my nephew or different ones I thought this is going to be such a hit and you the picture had this this this wall the Lego wall and Trump with his big hair and everything else and I ordered that thing and I think I paid 30 40 bucks for that thing and when it came in it was in a box this big and I was like I I sent him an email I have been jipped Trump is a Salesman but you guys RI me off you know the block were like you smaller than the size of my pinky nail but don't you know that when you go to these different places I know I get sidetracked way too easy but when you go to these places and and you're walking through the you wherever it might be in the workplace or here or there and all these things and you're walking and people are looking at you and your your heavenly bridegroom your heavenly husband is looking at that and he's saying that's my wife that's my wife you know I'm he puts you on display yeah he puts you on display so that he can show you all he says that's that's there's none like her she's beautiful she's gorgeous it's it's the it's everything I have have thought about everything I have created everything I have done is wrapped up in this one this one not an individual this one unit this one relationship this one bride this one wife right hallelujah amen that's who you are and he looks at you and he's just so proud of that amen that's right sometimes he sends you to the doctor's office to put his Union his Oneness on display amen sometimes he puts you on an MRI machine sometimes he sometimes he puts you in an oncologist office right what is he doing he's putting you on display yeah because you're his wife can you just some imagine what it must have been for job oh Lord I'm going have to I'm going have to be careful I'm just I won't finish and y'all just go eat there ain't no finishing that's the problem see he told me to can you just imagine what it was for job I mean we think of hard times you know there some pretty hard times but I mean you know people go bankrupt I man I've seen people go bankrupt by the Lord's Grace I've never had to go bankrupt I've got really close we used to come through our through our years and I'd have after I paid my bills I had $9 to put gas in the tank that wouldn't work today $9 to put gas in the tank and buy some hot dogs or a bag of potatoes or whatever for us to live on the rest of the week and we made it we did it we ate a lot of of of homemade fries fried daddy fries and and Polish sausages they were cheap back then you get a bag of 5B bag of potatoes that last you about all week long for a buck 50 yeah no wonder I put on 80 pounds when I think about it that way can you imagine though I mean here's job and and and job goes through these things and and and and he he loses he loses all his you know his cows are gone his his camels are gone his his sheep are gone he loses everything that's that's enough to take a family down but you know it didn't just stop there did it and then he lost his kids he lost his reputation his friends came so-called friends came they turned their back to him wouldn't even talk to him for seven days and then when they finally did start talking to them oh my goodness the the vitriol the vile that was coming out of their mouths you're a secret sinner we knew it all along was just it was the you could tell it was just the the jealousy that was in them absolutely right his own wife literally almost verbatim almost verbatim quoted Satan back to job Satan had stood before God and and talking about putting on display it wasn't that Satan came up and said hey there's a man down there you got a hedge built around and I think I should be able to get to him that ain't what he said he comes up and and and God just says oh casually oh where you been what are you doing have you have you considered my vant job and we would think hush don't do that don't spring my name up but you see God had so much confidence so much love that Union was so he knew that he could trust job there was a union that had taken place and he put him in the hardest of places the hardest of conditions amen all at one time because he knew what go what what job was capable of even when job didn't know what he was capable of God knew what he was capable of right he knew what he had in him have you considered my servant job a you won't let me at him he's privileged yeah he's got privilege he's got this he's got a hedge built around him he's got all the different things and God says okay I'll show you I'll take the Hedge away have at him and job gets down to the place we know the story gets down to the place he's on the as sheep he's scraping his boils and everything else he's lost everything he's wailing don't get me wrong job want some superhuman is sitting there saying ah God's got this he's in control that wasn't job at all he was human just like me and you and literally job's own wife turns to him and says why don't you curse God and die that's almost exactly what Satan told told God Satan took to him he said if you were to take that hedge off and you let me touch him let me get a hold of him he'll curse you to your face and here's his wife saying why don't you you curse God and die shows where her inspiration came from that was not a Godly wife being represented there a Godly wife would have been falling on her knees and praying with her husband at that time right amen amen so but job but job stood there and then it was all because God had put him on display I preached a message one time called God's display case and we think oh that's where you put in your grandma's China and that's where you putting your your great Grandmom's silverware and this and that and the little knickknacks that you collect that your kids give you and everything all these things that you want to put on display for for whoever comes into your house that you invite in your house you want to be able to display that and say look this this is special to me this is this is not just something that's stuck back in the drawer this is something that's special to me oh you're special to him Saints and and he takes them and he puts it up there in the display case but God's display case is not like our display case God you know our display case is for the stuff that we don't want nobody to touch God sits there and says touch them kick them y bite them cuss them tear them tear their hearts out of them tear their their everything but their soul you just can't touch their life you can touch their mind you can touch their body you can touch their Spirit even you can break their Spirit even right amen but there's something inside of you that Satan can't get hold of that's right hallelujah it's a seed of God it was predestinated before the foundation of the world to believe his word because God said in the beginning he created them as one one you were a part of him in the beginning you were one and if you were there in the beginning you'll be there in the ending right amen praise the Lord Jesus amen praise the Lord Jesus oh my husbands love your wives he presents it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so all men to love their wives as their own bodies that he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever hateth his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh is that right for this CA shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined into his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church I guarantee you this is not just a churchgoing experience this is not a Pew sitting experience this is not something to where somebody just gets oh I've read a few books or something like that I've got some ideas I tell you I think some of the hardest sermons I've ever preached was when there was this one particular individual that would come visit with his soon to be wife at the time and he had he had read he had studied Buddhism he had studied Shamanism he had studied the Catholics he had studied the Protestants the Pentecostals he had studied uh uh Hinduism he had studied I mean the guy's smart he's super smart he had all these things going through his head in Islam and all the things going through his head and he didn't know he didn't believe any of it and he'd sit there in that church in my church and he'd sit there and he'd listen to me preach and I'd preach to who wouldn't have it but it it just seemed like it wasn't going nowhere it made it so hard those are some of the hardest sermons I ever preached because it just it was just the man thought he knew enough there was no way that you could get to the man because you see he was so full of himself there's a reason he said let us be living sacrifices oh it's a mystery all right yeah right it's a great mystery it's a mystery that Satan with all his lies and his his lustful Spirits is covered over and buried very well today amen very well but God wants us to be one amen right even as we sit down here in Satan's Eden and we can definitely say we are the wool man we've got a lot of wo that we go through right we've got a lot of that stuff that we have to face fights of battles we have to fight all these different things amen that's the truth amen but you got to understand you got to remember you were taken out of his side the woman was taken out of the side of her spoken word husband hallelujah praise the Lord the woman came out of the side amen of the spoken word Son of God the second Adam right yeah amen right he said it's necessary that I go it's necessary that I do this for if I don't go you can't come where I am that's right there had to come a there had to come a separation even from that there had to come a separation the bride had to be pulled out yes she came out from that Riven side of Jesus Christ and as that blood and water poured out of that precious body there was a life given to the Bride of Jesus Christ and through that life we can find our true Oneness in him ain't that something that had to come out of his side so that we could go back into him right what a paradox that he'd have to he'd have to go to the cross and die and go through all these things and and literally have that life the life remember all he was the fullness of the godhead bodily it was dwelling within him that that God's seed that God life was held within that blood cell the life was in the blood and it was in there but for but for us to truly be able to come back and be one with him it had to be set loose there there's a saying what if you love something let it go right if you love something let it go I'll pick up my little niece you well we got I got this this gorgeous little great niece and you just want to pick her up oh I could just squeeze her to death you know she's so cute after a while she's going to have to get up and she's going to have to go on her own and express who she is and that's what God knew he had to set you free so you could express who you are in him he gave you the ability to express Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Christ the mystery brother Bram said now you see the secret what too to restore Fallen Eve sorry Brothers I didn't get you that quote the secret what to to restore Fallen Eve as she was was a free figure of the church and now notice as God opened up the sight of Adam and took out Eve by his own flesh and blood and divided his Spirit from masculine and feminis to feminis and he put it in eve took the rib from under his side and made Eve out of it so God did the same thing taking out of the sight of Christ the blood and the water and Christ is the word and taking the word and making up his church Eve see back to himself again Redeemed by the blood that was come from his body you see it now God's great mystery being unfolded that's been hid since the foundation of the world but prefigured it all the way down through Ain't That Wonderful Paul said it's a great mystery it's a great mystery and here in this day we have a prophet comes and he says oh you see it now God's great mystery being unfolded that's been hid since the foundation of the world but prefigured all the way down through Hallelujah glory to God the way was made through the death of Jesus abely and the wife was set free perfect type perfect type wo man and it truly is I mean this fleshly journey that we're on you know we I love brother brother Ernie used to say he said we're not fleshly beings having having a spiritual experience he said but no he said we're Spiritual Beings having an Earthly Earthly experience right we're literally we're literally Spiritual Beings having a a a an Earthly experience down here in flesh and you know what it's not easy not at all it's it is full of Woe and it's full of Sorrows and it's full of heart heartaches and all these different things to all who are dwelling in these fleshly Dwelling Places it's hard it's not exclusive to the Christians either it's hard all over the world breaks your heart heart when you see somebody go through some of the hardest things of life and they don't know Jesus man if only you know Jesus right I had an employer one time first surveyor ever worked for and he was an alcoholic and and and and druggie prescription druggie genius just a genius absolutely Genius of a man could figure things in his mind faster than 10 times faster than I can do it on a calculator and he would he would he would sit there and he would just get so strung out and everything and he'd cry and everything else and he I don't know why you one time he actually broke down he said I don't know what's wrong I don't know how to fix it I don't know what to do and all these things and I said Anthony listen you need Jesus you need Jesus I don't know the answers to all these things but I know Jesus does and and Jesus Christ can fix this situation he could break these bonds he could break these Cycles he could do all things you need Jesus amen and he looked at me and he said Jesus J is mad at me I said no he's not Anthony no he's not he said he's not mad at me he's not mad at you he's calling for you to come back he's calling for you to come back amen he never could get over that hump he never could get over that hump I walked in and I found him dead of an overdose he took blood pressure medicine and a 24 case a 24 case of these of huge beard butt ice or whatever it was nasty stuff drank himself to death with the blood pressure medicine stroked out right there four days later you brother Bram talks about those ones that that die and and it hurts to say this I'll just tell you that but he talks about those ones that that die but they don't have a body to go to remember remember you've got a word body are you are you a Christian today are you a Believer today amen you've got a word body if this if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting for us Eternal in the heavens right there's a sixth Dimension that is full of theopen these word bodies that are there amen and if if I was to fall over Dead with a heart attack right now and and and I'd be I'd be there I'd go I know my Lord amen I trust him I believe him I have no doubt whatsoever that when I'm absent here I'm going to be present there I'll close eyes here and I'll wake up over there Hallelujah right oh what a time that's going to be praise the Lord but he said if you don't have that if they don't have those those that theophany that word body waiting for them he said they're they're just kind of there many times not all the time but many times it's almost like limbo they're just stuck they they can't go there because they don't have a body and they they're not it's not judgment yet they can't go to the Judgment so they're just kind of stuck you say well you think that the law would go to hell that is a hell it's a separation which is what death is death is a separation there's a natural death and that's nothing but a separation from this Earthly body that has nothing to do with who you are Christians do not die no because they cannot be separated from Christ Jesus who loves them right but when they go you know if they were to go on beyond that then without that without that love of Christ without that Assurance without that body and they go he said they're just kind of wondering 4 days after my my boss my friend because we' become close by that time 4 days after that my other bosses of the time his wife was walking down the road doing you know she's exercising she's doing a power walk you

for granted love him with everything you got serve him with everything you got Unite with him with everything you got open yourself up and surrender with everything you got Paul tells us that in this thing here we grown earnestly amen Desiring to be back to that Oneness Amen to be clothed upon right amen that's that Oneness amen thank you praise the Lord Jesus thank you Lord praise the Lord Jesus

afternoon to be able to so be so yielded to him to be so surrendered to him to to to lose everything I am I have to lose my whole identity I Die daily and that's a that's a battle but Saint it's worth
