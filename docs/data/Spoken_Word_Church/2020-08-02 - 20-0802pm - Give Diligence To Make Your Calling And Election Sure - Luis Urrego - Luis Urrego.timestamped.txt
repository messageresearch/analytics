[5:04] afternoon
[5:05] and we're going to read from second
[5:06] peter chapter one second peter chapter
[5:08] one a very familiar
[5:10] scripture to us and
[5:14] ii peter chapter one verses three
[5:17] through eleven all right according to
[5:20] his divine power hath given unto us
[5:23] all things that pertain unto life and
[5:25] godliness
[5:27] though the knowledge of through the
[5:29] knowledge of him
[5:30] that hath called us to glory and virtue
[5:33] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[5:35] great and precious promises that by
[5:37] these
[5:38] you might be partakers of the divine
[5:40] nature
[5:41] having escaped the corruption that is in
[5:43] the world
[5:44] through lust we just certainly want to
[5:47] escape that
[5:48] corruption where the things get more
[5:50] rotten by the minute
[5:53] and besides this give giving all
[5:55] diligence
[5:56] add to your faith virtue and to virtue
[5:59] knowledge and to knowledge
[6:00] temperance and to temperance patience
[6:03] and to patience godliness
[6:04] and to godliness brotherly kindness and
[6:07] to brotherly kindness
[6:08] charity from that scripture right here
[6:10] this is where we get this chart right
[6:12] here
[6:12] all right that's the statue of the
[6:14] perfect man now i wanted to
[6:16] concentrate on verse 8 through 11. for
[6:19] if these things
[6:20] be in you now if they are
[6:23] supposed to be in you amen we know that
[6:26] this is to perfect
[6:27] to perfect us on the outside but they
[6:29] got to be inside of you first
[6:31] by the holy spirit amen and if these
[6:34] things be in you
[6:35] and abound they make you that ye shall
[6:37] neither be barren
[6:38] nor unfruitful that's key see these
[6:42] things are going to produce fruit
[6:44] because brother of the holy ghost if you
[6:46] have the holy spirit in your life it's
[6:47] going to produce
[6:48] manifest a certain type of fruit amen
[6:51] and the knowledge of our lord jesus
[6:53] christ but he that lacketh
[6:55] these things is blind that's pretty
[6:58] strong
[7:00] words and cannot see afar off
[7:03] and hath forgotten that he was purged
[7:05] from his old sins
[7:07] in other words you forgot where god
[7:08] saved you from
[7:11] wherefore the rather brethren give
[7:14] diligence to make your
[7:16] calling an election sure for if
[7:19] you do these things ye shall never fail
[7:23] amen for so an entrance shall be
[7:25] ministered unto you
[7:26] abundantly into the everlasting kingdom
[7:29] of our lord and savior jesus christ amen
[7:32] you may
[7:32] you may be seated the lord had blessing
[7:34] to the reading of his word
[7:36] praise god so it's if these
[7:39] things be in you now we have to
[7:42] understand
[7:43] again that we've we've explained this
[7:45] before that
[7:46] faith virtue knowledge temperance see
[7:48] all these things come from god
[7:50] amen you can't produce him on your own
[7:54] sure we have a little bit of of of some
[7:57] virtue
[7:58] some human virtue some human knowledge
[8:00] some human
[8:01] some human temperance we we're good to
[8:03] people i
[8:04] i know there's people out here that we
[8:06] see they're good they're patient
[8:07] there's some people that are more
[8:08] patient than some of us and they don't
[8:11] even go to church
[8:12] more patient than than some of us who
[8:14] say we believe the message and are
[8:16] christians filled with the holy spirit
[8:17] they got more temperance than some of us
[8:20] but
[8:21] but see these things amen true a true
[8:25] virtue true knowledge true temperance
[8:27] true patience true godliness
[8:28] and true brother ellis has to come by
[8:31] the holy ghost in your life
[8:32] and how do you get the holy ghost it's
[8:34] by a new birth
[8:35] amen by by by the new birth amen
[8:39] a revelation personally to you amen we
[8:42] all know these things but
[8:44] it is so key in order for you to
[8:46] manifest these things you have to be
[8:48] born again amen
[8:50] because they they will make you neither
[8:52] be barren nor unfruitful in the
[8:54] knowledge of our lord jesus christ
[8:56] again these things will produce the holy
[8:59] spirit in you will produce fruit
[9:01] amen right amen something's got to come
[9:04] out of
[9:05] out of out of god in you and it can't be
[9:08] you it's got to be him
[9:10] amen it's got to be his life because if
[9:12] his life is in you it's got to produce
[9:14] his life
[9:15] not your own thing not your own idea not
[9:17] your own way god is not interested in
[9:19] none of that
[9:20] god is only interested in his word amen
[9:23] in his word
[9:24] and then his word is life and his word
[9:27] should be our absolute amen
[9:29] praise god and and that's why the reason
[9:33] why i titled this uh
[9:34] uh give the diligence to make your
[9:36] calling an election sure in this hour
[9:38] saints
[9:39] it is so important that in this hour
[9:41] that we're living in
[9:43] so crucial so uh uh i believe the coming
[9:46] of the lord is in a hand
[9:48] i believe that that that that this thing
[9:50] is winding down
[9:52] i believe that this thing is uh is is is
[9:55] squeezing is squeezing us
[9:57] and and and sure it's it's happening in
[10:00] the world
[10:01] but you know i think ultimately it's god
[10:04] allowing it
[10:05] for you and me for me
[10:08] if you know over anything god is
[10:11] allowing it for
[10:12] you and me to what to examine ourselves
[10:16] this is not a time for us to get lacks
[10:19] this is not a time for
[10:20] for or to continue going our ways and
[10:23] some of us
[10:24] maybe even getting worse instead of
[10:27] getting holier we're getting
[10:28] we're getting worrier right it's for us
[10:32] to be able to examine ourselves and say
[10:34] where
[10:35] am i in the faith lord amen see as he
[10:38] said
[10:38] give diligence to make your calling and
[10:41] the election
[10:42] sure all right
[10:45] what what we what the things that that
[10:48] happened to us in order for us to do
[10:50] that
[10:51] amen squeezes have to come through
[10:54] you see sometimes uh so you know when
[10:57] you when you have an orange i always
[10:58] give it this example when you have an
[11:00] orange and you want
[11:01] and you when you squeeze amen that juice
[11:04] that comes out it proves what that
[11:05] orange is right
[11:07] you see that juice that comes out i'm
[11:09] not expecting pineapple juice to come
[11:11] out of the orange you see
[11:13] i'm expecting for orange juice to come
[11:14] out so sometimes squeezes and
[11:17] problems and tribulations amen are for
[11:20] us
[11:20] amen to see what we really are
[11:24] who are who did we really believe what
[11:26] is the word that we believe what what is
[11:28] this
[11:29] amen or is it just just another meeting
[11:31] just another coming to church
[11:33] just another message club
[11:36] because i believe some of us have
[11:38] treated the the coming to church
[11:40] coming just like we're coming to a club
[11:43] we're coming to a lodge
[11:44] amen i'm going to church i'm going to
[11:46] warm up a pew i'm going to warm up
[11:48] you know that's amen you need to be sure
[11:51] where you're standing in the word
[11:52] amen you need to know amen that what
[11:56] what is being is going forth in
[11:58] through by this behind this pulpit amen
[12:00] as being you're
[12:01] applying it in your life and fruit is
[12:04] coming out of that amen
[12:05] praise god amen so we are free moral
[12:09] agents
[12:10] god made us to be free moral agents god
[12:13] is not willing that
[12:14] any should perish but but
[12:17] that we come to repentance see and and
[12:20] it's awesome that god that's i believe
[12:21] that's the grace of god
[12:24] that god made us three more agents that
[12:26] we can choose to serve him
[12:28] or not right right amen but god knew
[12:31] that before the foundation of the world
[12:33] but god's not going to push you again as
[12:35] brother dale's been preaching lately
[12:36] amen chosen in him
[12:38] god's not going to push you through a
[12:39] tube and and the same way he pushed you
[12:42] is the same way you're going to come out
[12:43] and know
[12:44] amen there's got to be a choosing in
[12:46] your life as well
[12:47] you the things that have happened in
[12:49] your life has been
[12:50] because of choices bad or good that have
[12:53] happened in your life
[12:55] your mama didn't make you do it your
[12:56] daddy didn't make you do it your
[12:58] grandparents didn't make you do it your
[13:00] children don't make you do
[13:01] anything you decide ultimately what
[13:04] what it is that's happening in your life
[13:07] whether it's good or bad
[13:08] am i going to be a good father that's up
[13:11] to you as a father
[13:13] my children aren't going to dictate that
[13:15] the word of god is going to dictate that
[13:17] to me
[13:18] am i going to be a good husband i'm
[13:19] gonna look at the word and see what a
[13:21] good husband's supposed to be
[13:22] amen i'm not gonna look at anybody else
[13:24] i'm not gonna i'm gonna look at the word
[13:26] because there's no better husband than
[13:28] jesus christ was there's no better
[13:30] father than
[13:31] than the lord jesus christ amen there's
[13:33] no better son
[13:34] than the lord jesus christ amen that's
[13:36] the greatest examples that we have
[13:38] praise god so god knows who will make it
[13:41] and who won't
[13:42] he knew that before the foundation of
[13:44] the world praise god
[13:46] but we are free more agents to choose
[13:48] amen exactly where
[13:49] what what we're going to do amen with
[13:51] this word that's preached behind the
[13:53] pulpit
[13:54] are we going to take it really sincerely
[13:56] and apply it in our lives
[13:58] so that fruit can come out so that
[14:00] others can benefit from that fruit
[14:02] remember the fruit that you give off is
[14:04] not for you to eat
[14:05] is for others to enjoy right see the
[14:08] fruit that i get off
[14:09] that i give off is for zach to enjoy for
[14:11] brother dawn to enjoy amen
[14:13] they can learn something from oh wow
[14:15] praise god amen
[14:16] they can glean something from that fruit
[14:18] amen gain strength from that fruit
[14:21] you see but it's not for me i've never
[14:23] seen a tree
[14:24] eating its own fruit i've never seen a
[14:27] tree eating its own fruit
[14:28] the fruit that the tree gives off is for
[14:30] others to enjoy and for
[14:31] animals to enjoy amen praise god so
[14:34] look at yourself look at your life that
[14:36] way what fruit am i given amen
[14:39] is it good fruit is it bad fruit is it
[14:41] half rotten fruit
[14:43] amen because this fruit others are going
[14:45] to be eating from it as well
[14:47] amen others are going to be eating from
[14:50] that fruit praise god
[14:52] so i can do whatever i want to amen
[14:56] as a christian i can do whatever i want
[14:58] to that's right
[14:59] you know you know some people say some
[15:02] people say well you know it doesn't
[15:03] bother me to do this that or the other
[15:05] amen
[15:05] that's between you and god amen but i
[15:08] can go out here to the girl
[15:09] to the liquor store and buy me some
[15:11] vodka buy me a grape whatever gray goose
[15:14] or
[15:14] or 40 or whatever whatever whatever and
[15:17] i can drink
[15:19] but when i help when the holy
[15:20] spirit-filled person amen
[15:22] is truly filled with god they don't have
[15:24] a desire to do that anymore
[15:26] where i used to do it amen where i used
[15:29] to be comfortable doing it and being
[15:31] around my friends and doing it
[15:33] now when god changes your life there's
[15:35] no more comfort in that
[15:38] and the other thing is because i don't
[15:40] want other people to see me
[15:41] amen with a bottle of grey goose in my
[15:43] in my hand
[15:44] you see that's not who you are anymore
[15:47] praise god
[15:49] if i can do whatever i want to i just
[15:51] don't want to
[15:52] you know there's certain things that
[15:54] that i can do
[15:55] and i just don't want to not maybe
[15:58] because they're
[15:59] evil but sometimes it's because of their
[16:02] testimony's sake
[16:04] right there's many things you could put
[16:07] in there
[16:08] the bible's paul says blessed is the man
[16:11] who
[16:11] who whatever he do with he's not
[16:13] condemned within itself
[16:14] you see now that's between you and god
[16:17] whatever you think is good whatever you
[16:18] think is bad amen but
[16:21] amen we we need to make sure that that
[16:24] whatever
[16:25] we uh uh whatever we partake of amen is
[16:29] glorifying god and it's not damaging our
[16:31] testimony as christians
[16:33] because you could be your life could be
[16:35] a stumbling block just as much as a
[16:37] blessing
[16:38] to somebody somebody's always watching
[16:41] you
[16:42] always make sure i always remember that
[16:43] somebody is watching us
[16:45] maybe this is not what you came to hear
[16:47] this afternoon amen but this is uh maybe
[16:49] a little bit of admonition type word
[16:51] amen
[16:51] praise god every now and then we need to
[16:54] shake up amen sometimes amen get a hold
[16:58] of yourself
[16:58] amen amen and just and just so we can
[17:01] move on
[17:02] praise god amen this is what god put on
[17:06] my heart so
[17:08] but see some of the things that we do
[17:10] saints i don't i don't
[17:13] i don't smoke i i don't i don't drink i
[17:16] don't do none of these things
[17:17] and we do those things and we don't do
[17:19] those things it's because out of
[17:20] appreciation to god
[17:23] you appreciate the lord what he's done
[17:25] to you for you
[17:27] and therefore you don't do those things
[17:29] see i could i could
[17:31] i could go uh download all the uh the
[17:34] the hip hop music that i used to listen
[17:36] to when i was out in the world
[17:38] i sure could listen to outcasts and all
[17:40] those types of things i i could go back
[17:42] and listen to that if i wanted to
[17:45] the problem is amen i don't want to amen
[17:49] and the people that's what that's a
[17:50] problem amen the people having their
[17:51] life they don't have that i don't want
[17:53] to in them anymore
[17:54] they don't have that i don't want to do
[17:56] it amen
[17:57] they're doing it only because maybe mom
[17:59] and dad told him to do
[18:01] not to do it or my husband might catch
[18:03] me or my wife might catch me
[18:04] amen but if it's not in you amen to stop
[18:07] and let go of the world
[18:08] amen then something's wrong with you the
[18:11] altar is right here and you need to
[18:12] repent
[18:14] same thing with me we got to keep our
[18:17] testimony amen we got to check our
[18:19] motives amen
[18:20] check our modens to see if they're wrong
[18:23] amen
[18:24] if they're wrong or if they're right
[18:25] what are our motives like
[18:27] amen do you have good intentions behind
[18:29] the things that you do
[18:31] praise god is it too true is it to bless
[18:34] people
[18:35] amen is it to glorify god with your life
[18:38] or is it to just try to get away with
[18:39] things

[20:21] jesus christ said that out of the
[20:23] abundance of the heart
[20:25] speaketh the mouth you are going to say
[20:28] you are going to live
[20:29] exactly what's in your heart if the word
[20:32] is in your heart
[20:33] it's going to show forth the word
[20:35] there's going to be holiness in your
[20:36] life there's going to be temperaments
[20:37] there's going to be
[20:38] there's going to be a certain aura about
[20:40] you amen
[20:42] and nothing hypocritical either amen
[20:45] but if the word is not in your life and
[20:47] if that's not what you feed off on a
[20:48] daily basis
[20:50] it will show amen it will show
[20:53] so you're not fooling anybody eventually
[20:56] it will come to light
[20:57] i mean you can be fooling some of us
[20:59] here and you can be fooling people out
[21:00] there
[21:01] but you're never going to fool god
[21:03] you're never you're never going to fool
[21:05] god god knows exactly where you are
[21:07] spiritually in your life
[21:11] and so as ministers we have the
[21:14] responsibility to preach the word of god
[21:17] amen the whole counsel of god we're
[21:19] commanded to preach the whole council of
[21:21] god
[21:22] not just the things that you like to
[21:23] hear
[21:25] we are commanded to minister and preach
[21:27] the whole council of god
[21:29] we are commanded to teach the great
[21:31] doctrines of the bible
[21:32] whereas we are also commanded to preach
[21:34] against sin and
[21:35] to get into your home a little bit
[21:38] whether you like it or not
[21:39] right brother branham did
[21:43] he was the prophet of the age amen so
[21:46] did paul
[21:46] in the bible and he was one of the
[21:48] messengers of the of the
[21:50] of the church ages i believe a true
[21:53] called minister does that
[21:55] not because he's preaching against the
[21:56] people but he's preaching against the
[21:58] sin
[21:59] he sees the danger coming ahead amen and
[22:01] he knows that if he doesn't say
[22:03] something against that amen the people
[22:06] are going to be ruined
[22:08] it's going to drag them away that's
[22:10] right and i have to use brother wade uh
[22:13] i really got uh uh inspired by those
[22:16] scriptures that brother wade's been
[22:17] reading lately there in ezekiel about
[22:19] the watchmen
[22:20] amen now we're going to read those
[22:22] scriptures here in just a moment but
[22:24] we're going to read them in
[22:25] in the english english standard version
[22:27] it's a much simpler
[22:28] easier way to read them so that you
[22:30] could see
[22:31] the importance of god has called
[22:34] watchman
[22:35] over your life amen
[22:38] i think we should reverence them i think
[22:40] we should respect them i think we should
[22:42] we should we should thank god for it
[22:44] for them amen because they're there amen
[22:47] trying to listen amen to
[22:49] see what is it god that you want me to
[22:51] speak to the people
[22:52] in order to help them not to cling them
[22:55] on the head
[22:55] not to not to thump them on the head
[22:57] amen not to bring them down amen but to
[23:00] help them so that they could get up from
[23:01] their
[23:02] slumber amen and continue moving on with
[23:04] god
[23:06] amen praise god
[23:09] amen again it's not it's not to call you
[23:12] out but it's to call out the sin in your
[23:14] life
[23:15] that's that's the key to call out the
[23:18] sin in your life not to call you out
[23:20] i think that would be inappropriate for
[23:22] a minister to do that especially from
[23:23] behind the pulpit
[23:25] unless he's on one on one with you amen
[23:28] praise god so let's let's read
[23:31] let's read that ezekiel chapter 33
[23:33] brother brother bob
[23:35] if you could bring that up from the
[23:38] english yeah
[23:41] let's just read this real quick the word
[23:42] of the lord came to me he said
[23:44] son of man speak to your people say to
[23:47] them
[23:47] whenever i bring enemy soldiers to fight
[23:50] against the country
[23:51] the people choose someone to be a
[23:53] watchman
[23:54] okay if this guard sees enemy soldiers
[23:58] coming he blows the trumpet and warns
[24:00] the people
[24:02] that's his duty that's his job amen
[24:05] and he shouldn't be criticized for it
[24:07] either because that's his job
[24:10] if people hear the warning but ignore it
[24:12] the enemy will capture them and take
[24:14] them away
[24:15] as prisoners that's going to be the
[24:17] consequences if the if the watchman
[24:19] doesn't do his job
[24:20] they will be responsible for their own
[24:23] death the people will
[24:24] the watchman's not responsible if he's
[24:26] doing his job
[24:28] they heard the trumpet but they ignored
[24:30] the warning
[24:31] so they are responsible for their own
[24:33] deaths
[24:35] i'm not responsible brother wade's not
[24:37] responsible no minister is responsible
[24:39] if the word is being preached then you
[24:41] don't go do
[24:42] exactly what the word says that's
[24:44] between you and the word
[24:46] that's between you and god they heard
[24:48] the trumpet but they ignored the warning
[24:50] so they are responsible for their own
[24:52] deaths if they had paid attention to the
[24:54] warning they could have saved their own
[24:57] lives
[24:58] but instead you know he's just up there
[25:00] meddling he's just up there
[25:02] you know just ask just him that i'm not
[25:04] gonna you know no
[25:06] what if he's telling you the word of god
[25:08] [Music]
[25:09] amen but what if the guard sees the
[25:13] enemy soldiers coming
[25:15] but does not blow the trumpet since he
[25:18] doesn't warn the people the enemy will
[25:20] capture them and take them away as
[25:22] prisoners
[25:23] they will be taken away because they
[25:25] sinned but the guard will also be
[25:27] responsible for their deaths
[25:31] that's not something that i want to have
[25:32] on me amen
[25:35] i don't want your blood to be on me amen
[25:38] when god
[25:38] amen when i when god tells me to say
[25:40] something amen
[25:42] now son of man watch this now son of man
[25:45] i am choosing you this is god now
[25:47] speaking to ezekiel directly
[25:49] and telling him i am choosing you to be
[25:51] a watchman for the family of israel
[25:55] you know and i'm sure brother wade could
[25:56] probably say the same thing i didn't
[25:58] i i never thought that i would be a
[26:00] minister
[26:03] i never and even even in prepping this
[26:06] this
[26:06] sermon this sermon last night i woke up
[26:09] this morning
[26:10] i said i don't want to preach this you
[26:12] don't
[26:14] you don't you don't want you know to to
[26:16] tell the people and
[26:18] and and tell them to think on their ways
[26:21] no you like for people to be able to
[26:23] come back and say that was a great
[26:25] message
[26:25] and rub you you know all you know but
[26:28] but
[26:28] but you know what sometimes that can't
[26:30] happen
[26:31] especially when there's nonsense going
[26:33] on
[26:35] and you know what nonsense is going on
[26:37] in your life i don't know
[26:38] you see but this is the whole council of
[26:41] god
[26:41] amen amen now son of man i'm choosing
[26:45] you to be a watchman for the family of
[26:47] israel if you hear a message from my
[26:50] mouth
[26:51] you must warn the people for me
[26:54] i might say to you these evil people
[26:57] will die
[26:58] then you must go warn them for me if you
[27:00] don't warn them
[27:02] and tell them to change their lives
[27:04] those evil people will die because they
[27:06] sinned
[27:07] but i will make you responsible for
[27:08] their deaths
[27:10] amen but if you do warn the evil people
[27:13] to change their lives and stop
[27:15] sinning and if they refuse to stop they
[27:18] will die because they sinned
[27:20] but you have saved your life
[27:24] it's clear as mud right
[27:28] now who can argue with that oh that's
[27:31] just only for the old testament
[27:33] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[27:35] and forever
[27:37] amen right that's right it's it's no no
[27:39] that's just only for israel god was the
[27:41] only talking to
[27:42] no the whole council of god is the word
[27:44] of god you've got to see christ from
[27:46] genesis to revelation
[27:48] amen and that word applies to
[27:51] us in this hour saints amen
[27:54] don't think of somebody amen when
[27:56] somebody's really in love amen trying to
[27:58] tell you and warn you amen
[28:00] hey watch your way stop doing this what
[28:03] are you what's going on dude
[28:06] what people end up doing is just getting
[28:08] upset
[28:09] they don't and you know what that is
[28:10] that's pride
[28:13] what's pride when you don't recognize
[28:15] your folly
[28:16] because you don't want to bow down to
[28:18] the person not bow down but submit to
[28:20] the person that's telling you you're
[28:21] falling
[28:22] right what if god sent that person to
[28:24] you
[28:25] what is it that why is it you know let's
[28:27] look for example at david when
[28:30] nathan came to him and told him about
[28:31] his fault about what he had done
[28:34] what if nathan what if dan what if uh uh
[28:37] david would have reacted
[28:38] with i'm not listening to you don't tell
[28:40] me what to do
[28:41] i could do whatever i want to i could go
[28:43] sleep with more women if i wanted to
[28:45] and and murder more if i wanted to david
[28:48] would not have gotten to the place where
[28:50] he
[28:50] where he got he softened his heart and
[28:53] he
[28:53] and he knew that that was the lord
[28:55] talking amen
[28:57] he recognized the word amen that was
[28:59] directly to him
[29:01] i believe god i really honestly believe
[29:03] god is speaking through us
[29:04] it's not coincidence that brother waves
[29:05] bring bringing these these these
[29:07] scriptures amen
[29:08] to us amen it's for us to reflect and to
[29:12] look at ourselves
[29:14] amen and to think amen where am i at in
[29:17] this hour
[29:18] because i don't think we have much more
[29:20] time saying
[29:22] and the time that we have left here amen
[29:24] it's the grace of god and the mercy of
[29:25] god to you
[29:27] to fix things in your life wherever
[29:29] they're wrong
[29:31] you know what it is
[29:34] don't pat it don't pet things and don't
[29:36] baby things when you know that you need
[29:38] to get rid of them in your life
[29:41] amen praise god
[29:46] i had to do that myself the other day
[29:47] listen i'm telling on myself
[29:50] there's things amen that i had to i had
[29:53] to think
[29:54] wait a second i want my daughters to go
[29:57] this way to walk this way
[29:58] as a father right i want my daughters to
[30:01] look at this example
[30:02] but i'm not doing exactly what i want
[30:05] with the i would want for them to do
[30:07] in this certain area that i would that
[30:09] i'm talking about
[30:10] god knows what it is now i
[30:13] as the father have to lead as an example
[30:16] and if you want your children to
[30:18] see a man an example in your life and to
[30:21] go
[30:22] a certain way you have to model that for
[30:24] them
[30:26] you have to be the model for that
[30:27] because that's all they know is you as
[30:29] their as their parent
[30:30] until they get older and get the holy
[30:32] ghost themselves
[30:34] i had to come to that conclusion myself
[30:37] as a parent amen
[30:40] because they're looking for you they're
[30:42] looking at you
[30:44] i have i have been called out by my own
[30:46] children and said papi
[30:47] you're telling us to do this but why are
[30:49] you doing this amen
[30:50] sure what what what are you supposed to
[30:53] say to that
[30:57] what in the you know and and you know
[30:59] what as parents some of us we don't want
[31:01] to we don't want to lower ourselves to
[31:03] our children
[31:04] and say honey you're right you know you
[31:07] are absolutely right and i believe it's
[31:09] god talking to you
[31:10] no we just get mad at them go to your
[31:13] room yeah right yeah
[31:15] yeah you don't talk to me like that
[31:18] you're grounded for a week
[31:20] well let's
[31:23] [Music]
[31:24] [Laughter]
[31:27] god uses our children to talk to us
[31:30] i believe that with all my heart and i
[31:33] think the younger they are
[31:34] the more they even talk to you
[31:36] [Laughter]
[31:37] amen so uh
[31:41] proverbs 22 3 the bible says a prudent
[31:44] man
[31:45] foreseeth the evil and hideth himself
[31:49] see but the simple pass on and are
[31:52] punished
[31:54] you see a prudent man looks ahead looks
[31:57] wait a second this ain't right in my
[31:58] life this is
[31:59] and does something about it doesn't let
[32:02] it just grow
[32:03] and fester and continue amen and you
[32:06] know
[32:06] and you know you do something about it
[32:09] and the but the simple
[32:10] pass on and are punished in other words
[32:12] the ones that don't think on their ways
[32:15] they're good they're gonna they're going
[32:17] to receive the uh
[32:18] the uh the the consequences of that
[32:22] of those things is this simple enough
[32:24] for us
[32:26] amen praise god isaiah 58 1 that brother
[32:29] wade has been reading i think this is
[32:31] wonderful too cry aloud spare not lift
[32:34] up thy voice like a trumpet
[32:35] and show my people their transgressions
[32:39] this is to isaiah now to ezekiel he was
[32:41] telling him the same thing and to isaiah
[32:43] he's telling him the same thing
[32:45] amen right amen jesus christ the same
[32:47] yesterday today and forever
[32:49] and listen show my people their
[32:51] transgression
[32:53] and the house of jacob their sins
[32:58] that's that's for us too amen
[33:02] why is it that god put a faithful
[33:03] ministry for us
[33:05] we don't have old testament prophets
[33:08] like they had back then you know we have
[33:10] prophets that's part of the
[33:11] the but why is it that god gave us a
[33:14] five full ministry amen
[33:17] to warn us right
[33:20] for the perfection of the saints amen
[33:23] and you're only going to be perfected by
[33:25] the word
[33:26] amen that there's they're speaking that
[33:28] it can't be contrary to the word
[33:31] amen it's got to be it's got to be go
[33:33] with the word it's got to go with the
[33:34] message
[33:35] and if if you are not perfected it's
[33:38] not god's fault
[33:41] if your word doesn't perfect you instead
[33:43] when the word goes forth you get mad
[33:46] and you draw that preacher and he's like
[33:47] he's not one of my favorite preachers
[33:49] anymore
[33:49] yeah you know you're out of the circle
[33:51] no because he preaches on me too much
[33:54] then you're not letting the word perfect
[33:57] that's between you and god amen
[34:02] see as ministers all we do is cast out
[34:04] the net all right
[34:06] that's all we can do amen we cast out
[34:09] the net now

[36:21] that word all of them
[36:23] oh it feels good to be all under the
[36:24] word amen
[36:26] and jumping around and shouting and
[36:28] that's all wonderful and good but
[36:30] eventually they'll show their true
[36:31] colors
[36:33] they'll get out from under the net
[36:36] and get away and even the fish there's
[36:39] fish
[36:40] that will do the same thing too
[36:43] they'll jump in and and you know and and
[36:46] shout and and
[36:47] all these things while they're under the
[36:49] net you know but
[36:51] eventually them being make believers
[36:54] they look like fish
[36:57] like true fish eventually they'll come
[36:59] out from under the net too
[37:01] but the true fish amen the true fish
[37:04] will submit to the net
[37:08] to the word amen
[37:11] and we'll get carried with the word amen
[37:13] and be used for the master's purpose
[37:19] this has this has to do a lot with
[37:21] submission saints
[37:23] submitting ourselves to the word
[37:27] amen how are we going to be perfected
[37:30] through the word that's preached through
[37:32] the five-fold ministry
[37:34] it's not the five-fold ministry that
[37:35] perfects you it's the word that they
[37:37] preach
[37:39] so when you're coming against the the
[37:41] the faithful ministry or when you're
[37:43] or when you just say they're just
[37:44] meddling or they shouldn't be in my
[37:46] business they're being nosy and all this
[37:47] kind of stuff
[37:48] you're coming against the word if the
[37:50] word is preaching in your life and
[37:52] you're there squirming and
[37:54] and and and blowing up like a toad you
[37:56] know
[37:58] then it's the word that's discerning
[38:00] that in your life it's not the preacher
[38:02] if the preacher doesn't live with you
[38:06] take that for what it's worth and think
[38:09] about it
[38:13] again maybe this is not what you were
[38:15] expecting you were expecting for us to
[38:16] talk about god's peace and god's
[38:18] reassurance amen
[38:21] we need to hear these things too amen
[38:26] amen praise god saint
[38:30] so those those fish submitted amen
[38:34] the church has to be run by the holy
[38:36] spirit
[38:37] amen and if you have the holy spirit in
[38:39] your life again
[38:40] you're going to produce fruit in your
[38:42] life god's fruit
[38:44] not your own fruit we are to bear fruit
[38:46] not we don't produce fruit
[38:48] we are to bear fruit amen
[38:51] we don't produce fruit amen see whatever
[38:54] a tree
[38:54] is whatever that life is in that tree
[38:57] that's the kind of fruit that's going to
[38:58] come out of that tree
[39:00] you see that's the reason why i don't
[39:03] have so
[39:04] you don't have to ask certain people
[39:05] what they believe or what or what they
[39:07] you know what their ideas are or what
[39:09] they'll just it'll just come out of them
[39:12] it'll just come out of them you can see
[39:14] it that doesn't have to be a rock
[39:16] a rock star or a rapper or anything like
[39:18] that you can see it even in the church
[39:20] what people are like what people what
[39:22] what people really
[39:23] are you just see it especially by the
[39:25] way they talk and by the way they carry
[39:27] themselves
[39:28] you can see what they do and don't do
[39:30] amen amen
[39:31] praise god brother brown says here and
[39:33] the message the brothers could bring
[39:34] this up why some people can't keep the
[39:36] victory
[39:37] there's a lot of things i got from this
[39:39] message
[39:40] so you just go back and read that
[39:42] message amen
[39:43] and brother branham we will just we'll
[39:45] just tell you the same thing i'm telling
[39:47] you
[39:48] now notice now the church doesn't need a
[39:50] polishing it doesn't need a facelift and
[39:52] it needs a birth
[39:54] it needs a conversion something's got to
[39:57] happen
[39:58] not just to strengthen our borders not
[40:00] to bring new members a revival is not to
[40:02] get new members
[40:03] a revival is to revive what we got
[40:06] that's what we so badly need
[40:10] amen we have the word
[40:14] right we have we have the the
[40:17] we got the doctrines lined up everything
[40:20] we can explain them away
[40:22] but what does that matter if you don't
[40:25] know how to treat your wife at home
[40:28] if you don't know how to treat your
[40:29] husband at home if you don't
[40:32] if you kids don't know how to obey your
[40:33] parents
[40:35] what does it matter that you could
[40:36] explain daniel 70 weeks to the t
[40:39] and all these things as as good as those
[40:40] doctrines are and we need them
[40:43] i'm not discounting them so don't don't
[40:45] don't misunderstand me we need that
[40:48] but if you don't know how to treat your
[40:49] wife at home amen
[40:51] and respect her and and and and and see
[40:54] her for for what god has given her to
[40:56] you
[40:57] amen something's wrong with your life
[41:01] see we feel we got we got this comfort
[41:03] this the security blanket over us
[41:05] that you know we hear the word we come
[41:07] and we listen to the word here and
[41:09] when brother wade believes the word and
[41:11] brother dale preaches the word but but
[41:13] you know what saints
[41:14] that we shouldn't use that as a security
[41:16] blanket
[41:18] the real christian life is what the life
[41:20] that we live at home
[41:22] at church is easy to be a christian at
[41:25] church is easier to show
[41:26] something that you're not right and to
[41:28] dress the part
[41:30] and to even talk the part but it's at
[41:32] home
[41:33] and it's at your job at the things that
[41:35] you do on a daily basis
[41:37] on your personal life that shows who you
[41:40] really are
[41:42] amen or or what is it that you're really
[41:45] feeding on
[41:46] amen praise god brother branham here
[41:50] talking about about a revival you know
[41:53] and and we look at a lake or an ocean
[41:55] amen when those waves are moving and
[41:57] when those waves you know
[41:59] that water amen that lake or that ocean
[42:02] has no more water in it right
[42:05] than when it's moving amen then when it
[42:08] started or
[42:09] when it stains still yeah it's the same
[42:11] amount of water
[42:12] you see amen see god has given us a a
[42:16] certain amount of water in our lives
[42:18] amen he's giving us word
[42:20] amen and that and when the wind starts
[42:23] blowing
[42:24] the pentecostal wind the the the winds
[42:27] of the word amen
[42:28] when they start blowing through it's
[42:31] going to shake amen that in you
[42:33] that word that you've already heard and
[42:36] cause a revival in your life
[42:40] amen see i believe that that the other
[42:43] day when we had
[42:44] when we had the the wonderful services
[42:46] that we had with brother brother andrew
[42:47] glover amen
[42:49] and and and i believe god was in our
[42:51] midst
[42:52] amen in a powerful way and we saw things
[42:55] that
[42:55] we definitely needed to have them amen
[42:58] praise god but you know what
[43:02] if you are if you are doing those things
[43:06] and there's no word in you amen
[43:08] then it's it's nothing amen but when the
[43:10] word is in you amen and you're and
[43:12] you're
[43:12] and you're rejoicing in the word and man
[43:14] running down the aisles or whatever amen
[43:16] and you're rejoicing in it
[43:17] amen there's no condemnation i mean the
[43:20] word is in you amen that that's what
[43:22] that right there that word just revives
[43:24] the word more
[43:26] and causes you to act amen praise god
[43:30] i believe all of us we need that yes we
[43:32] need
[43:33] we need those with those things
[43:35] sometimes we just get too comfortable
[43:37] over there in the corner right
[43:39] you know yeah preacher brother dale
[43:43] yeah amen and then and then when
[43:47] something like that happens
[43:49] in our midst an evangelist comes in and
[43:51] stuff like that
[43:52] we don't we don't know what to do yeah
[43:54] oh my goodness he's
[43:55] he's preaching too fast he's you know
[43:58] amen it's the fatherful ministry that's
[44:02] right
[44:02] we all need amen amen praise god
[44:07] and so see that that those when those
[44:09] waves are moving that's a revival to us
[44:11] amen
[44:12] praise god and it what is a revival a
[44:14] revival a lake
[44:16] has waves and the ocean has waves in
[44:19] order to take the trash out from the
[44:20] ocean
[44:22] that's the reason why the waves move and
[44:24] the ocean moves and the lakes move is to
[44:26] take the trash out
[44:28] that's the reason why we need revivals
[44:29] in our lives
[44:31] amen not not necessarily that you need
[44:33] to jump shout and scream and stuff like
[44:35] that
[44:35] but you need to i mean look into
[44:37] yourself and examine yourself
[44:40] if you look and examine your life amen i
[44:43] believe the fact that you're doing that
[44:44] that's a revival within itself
[44:47] you see if the word causes you to do
[44:49] that
[44:50] and not just to look at yourself and say
[44:52] i do need to do this
[44:54] but you don't do anything about it
[44:57] then that that's not that's not going to
[44:59] get anywhere
[45:00] it's not enough just to acknowledge it's
[45:02] when you acknowledge
[45:04] and do amen acknowledge and do
[45:07] make a change in your life so that your
[45:09] family can see it
[45:10] so that others can see it amen praise
[45:13] god
[45:14] hebrews 12 1 says let us lay
[45:18] aside every weight and the sin amen
[45:20] wherefore seeing we also are compassible
[45:22] with so great a cloud of witness let us
[45:24] lay us out of our way
[45:25] every way and the sin which does so
[45:27] easily beset us
[45:29] and let us run with patience the race
[45:31] that is set before us
[45:32] [Music]
[45:34] god didn't say there that uh that i'm
[45:36] going to lay aside your weight and your
[45:38] sin that no he said for you to do it
[45:41] you've got to do it i can't do it for
[45:44] you god can't do it for you
[45:46] see the word says it so you do it amen
[45:49] amen
[45:50] praise god amen it's like that goldsmith
[45:53] amen that goldsmith that's beating that
[45:54] gold amen
[45:56] beating that gold amen he bleats it he
[45:58] beats it
[45:59] and then he turns it over and he beats
[46:01] it all on the other side amen
[46:03] until he sees his own reflection and
[46:05] very man the word is never
[46:07] the word is not always going to be nice
[46:09] and pretty
[46:10] and and and it's you know you're going
[46:13] to say amen to it all the time
[46:17] you know it's going to be harsh
[46:19] sometimes
[46:20] but that's the word jesus was
[46:23] is the exact same way amen he said
[46:26] he talked about the beatitudes and when
[46:29] we think about the beatitudes when he
[46:31] preached the sermon on the mount we
[46:32] think that
[46:33] oh my he's you know he's he's just
[46:35] telling the people you know in
[46:36] such a you know kind of like a
[46:39] intellectual way
[46:40] you know and he's talking to them amen
[46:42] and we receive that
[46:44] we love the beatitudes but we hate it
[46:46] when he comes in there and takes a man
[46:49] and he starts knocking things down and
[46:51] because he's jealous of the word that's
[46:53] being broken
[46:55] we don't like that too much we don't
[46:57] like that jesus we like the jesus that's
[46:59] soft and
[46:59] kind amen but we need both of them
[47:03] we need both of them in order to shape
[47:05] our lives
[47:06] amen praise god amen so in order to take
[47:10] out the
[47:11] the the gold is beat amen amen that word
[47:14] beats you
[47:15] in order to take out the pyrite the
[47:17] copper and the dross out of that gold
[47:19] before it can be used amen
[47:23] praise god um
[47:26] see saying sometimes you know we're so
[47:28] we're so loyal
[47:29] we're so loyal to to our our our country
[47:32] we're so
[47:33] patriotic and we're so you know and i
[47:36] believe you should
[47:37] you should be patriotic you should be
[47:39] you should you should love your country
[47:41] and you should love for what it stands
[47:42] for and stuff like that
[47:44] amen but there's so much loyalty to
[47:46] those things
[47:48] and i like what brother aaron says you
[47:50] know you you you're
[47:52] fussing and you're stewing about
[47:53] politics and and you're talking about
[47:55] i'm a more of a republican i'm i'm a
[47:57] conservative and all these
[47:58] and you and you're just gun-ho about it
[48:00] i'm a conservative i stand
[48:02] with with president trump trump 2020
[48:06] you know and and you're not gun hoe
[48:09] about the word
[48:11] the one that really loves you trump is
[48:14] not going to change anything
[48:16] neither is biden and you can see what
[48:18] just happened
[48:19] yeah trump trump can't fix anything
[48:23] no god's the one that fixes things
[48:26] and and you're gun hoe about posting it
[48:29] on facebook 24 7
[48:31] and you're there posting your politics
[48:33] when that's not going to change people
[48:35] the changes people is the word amen
[48:38] what is beneficial to somebody is the
[48:41] word the eternal word
[48:43] that's what changes i'm you
[48:46] you know it's fine you can be you could
[48:48] be uh but you know i i i love my country
[48:50] i love colombia i love
[48:52] where i was born and grew up in and part
[48:54] of my life
[48:56] but hey man i'm a citizen of another
[49:00] country
[49:00] amen and i'm going to look to that
[49:04] i'm going to post about that right
[49:08] i'm going to that's what i'm going to
[49:10] i'm going to talk about
[49:12] much more than any of these things that
[49:14] are perishing
[49:16] brother like brother aaron said you're
[49:17] just arranging the
[49:19] the the the furniture in the titanic
[49:23] it's going to sink the titanic's going
[49:26] to sink and you're talking about
[49:27] republican versus democrat here and
[49:29] there all you're doing is just arranging
[49:30] the furniture
[49:32] eventually it's going to sink it's sad
[49:35] to see our country go that way
[49:37] but the bible says that it would go that
[49:39] way
[49:41] so why are we trying to be just so
[49:43] gung-ho and say my rights
[49:44] it's my right you know yeah what about
[49:48] god's rights
[49:49] the rights that it's in the word and yet
[49:51] you don't know anything about it when
[49:52] somebody asks you about the word you
[49:54] don't know
[49:55] what is the new birth i don't know i
[49:57] just go to lula
[50:05] see when a preacher starts preaching
[50:07] that way we're just call meddling
[50:09] we're told that we're meddling where you
[50:11] shouldn't begin in my business
[50:13] and all those types of things and and
[50:15] now you shouldn't
[50:16] be doing that but jesus did it
[50:21] and and and brother brown did it many
[50:23] times too
[50:25] didn't call out people by name no
[50:28] but he called out that sin amen
[50:31] i use that as my example yeah those are
[50:33] my examples
[50:34] amen amen see if the word of god gets
[50:38] all up in your business
[50:39] it makes you squirm and stuff hey man it
[50:41] needed to do that that's right
[50:43] see satan doesn't like to be exposed
[50:45] satan you know what the times when
[50:47] brother branham would be exposing satan
[50:49] in people's lives
[50:50] they'd get all squirmy and you know
[50:55] satan doesn't like to be exposed amen
[50:58] i hope this is exposing satan in in some
[51:01] of our lives including my life
[51:04] i can say saints i i'm not where i i
[51:06] would like to be
[51:09] amen but i i i want i i know that
[51:13] i'm not what i used to be but i know
[51:15] that there's a place that i want to be
[51:17] a man and i'm striving and achieving
[51:19] amen day by day to do that
[51:22] praise god we should just say when
[51:25] somebody is
[51:26] preaching like this and calling things
[51:29] out amen
[51:30] is is is god you love me so much
[51:35] that that brother up there doesn't know
[51:37] what what doesn't know anything
[51:40] and i believe it's god speaking to you
[51:42] no amen
[51:44] instead you just get upset mad and angry
[51:46] at the brother
[51:48] it's not even the brother's fault
[51:49] [Music]
[51:52] amen you draw him out of your circle
[51:56] you don't want no it's not my favorite
[51:57] preacher anymore no
[51:59] that's amen praise god
[52:02] i'm trying to skip a lot some of these
[52:04] things mark 6 i mean if you read mark 6
[52:07] where jesus was was uh in his own
[52:09] country
[52:11] in his own country to want to minister
[52:13] to the people
[52:14] to want to uh do good for the people to
[52:18] want and in his own country because
[52:20] people knew him
[52:21] and they were comfortable with him isn't
[52:23] this uh joseph's
[52:25] son and and he's a carpenter
[52:28] and he's mary's son um you know yeah you
[52:31] know where did
[52:32] it's all right what's he's listening to
[52:34] what he's saying it's okay you know but
[52:36] i'm still gonna go over here and do my
[52:38] own thing afterwards you know and
[52:40] and still you know and the bible says
[52:42] there
[52:43] that the people there in that country
[52:44] were offended at him
[52:47] we're offended at jesus miracles taking
[52:50] place everywhere else and all kinds of
[52:52] wonderful things taking place but in his
[52:54] own country
[52:55] he didn't have nothing hardly going on
[52:57] the bible says there in
[52:58] in mark chapter 6 that the people were
[53:01] offended at him and
[53:02] he jesus could not do many great works
[53:06] actually no great works in that city
[53:09] he said it says except he only laid his
[53:12] hands on a few people
[53:14] and healed him
[53:17] now i wander saints because of our
[53:19] disrespect
[53:20] and our and our in our in our uh the way
[53:23] we look
[53:24] at the ministry and the way we look at
[53:26] people we're so
[53:27] we're so comfortable with one another
[53:29] and we disrespect one another so much
[53:32] that god cannot do many great things
[53:34] amongst us
[53:37] it happened in jesus life and could it
[53:39] happen in our life
[53:40] because we're so comfortable with each
[53:42] other we mistreat one another by the way
[53:44] by the things we say to each other
[53:46] the way we act towards each other the
[53:48] way the way we're so
[53:50] we're so neglectful about our attitudes
[53:52] towards each other
[53:54] and you don't understand that that's
[53:55] hindering god's move in our lives
[53:59] think about that saints going forward
[54:02] amen
[54:04] is my life hindering god's move or is it
[54:07] drawing god's move amen i want to draw
[54:10] god's move in my life
[54:12] i want to see people be delivered not
[54:14] just he not just healed physically i
[54:16] want to see people be delivered
[54:17] spiritually
[54:19] and are you asked the question is it me
[54:22] that's causing these people to not be
[54:23] delivered
[54:24] is it me that is causing young people to
[54:26] not come in
[54:28] and be born again have a true new birth
[54:31] in their life
[54:32] we thank god for the ones that have come
[54:34] in recently and we thank god for what
[54:36] god's doing
[54:37] in each one of them and i believe god's
[54:38] doing the work in every one of our young
[54:40] people
[54:42] but we as adults we as we we need to
[54:45] show we need to be salty before them
[54:48] and if they see that we're disrespecting
[54:50] one another and mistreating one another
[54:52] and mishandling each other
[54:54] amen that's gonna that's gonna cause
[54:57] them amen that's not that's gonna hinder
[54:58] the moves of god
[55:01] don't say no no it's just god that does
[55:03] it all no yes he does it all amen but we
[55:05] also have something
[55:07] a part to play in that as well that's
[55:09] right
[55:10] our attitudes amen we'll we'll shape
[55:12] things
[55:13] whether for the negative or the positive
[55:16] your attitude towards the word
[55:19] amen praise god
[55:22] so so um
[55:26] brother branham in that message and i
[55:27] like that he talked about the old skins
[55:29] and the new skins amen
[55:31] the wine skins amen and
[55:34] and and the old one jesus said that if
[55:37] you put wine in old wine bottles
[55:39] amen they new wine they would burst
[55:44] they would burst why is that well it's
[55:47] because the old wine bottles they don't
[55:50] have oil
[55:51] see old and old skins don't have
[55:54] oil they don't have you know the thing
[55:57] that would allow the the skin to stretch
[56:01] the more you put wine in there the more
[56:03] it should be stretched
[56:04] it should be stretching but he said that
[56:07] if you put
[56:08] good wine new wine in new bottles amen
[56:11] even old bonding new bottles it's going
[56:13] to be
[56:14] the skin is going to stretch
[56:18] in other words that skin because it has
[56:20] oil in it
[56:21] the oil from the from the animal baby
[56:25] it's going to allow it for it to be
[56:26] flexible
[56:28] and saints that's the thing if we have
[56:30] the life of god in us the way we say
[56:33] that we do
[56:34] the way you should as a christian
[56:36] believer of this
[56:37] end time message should when the word of
[56:39] god is preached
[56:40] and that wine amen that stimulation amen
[56:43] is going
[56:44] forth behind the pulpit amen you should
[56:46] be able to make way for that amen and
[56:48] say
[56:48] god i want to allow more of this in my
[56:50] life in order to change me
[56:52] amen because as that wine expands inside
[56:54] that new skin
[56:56] amen it's causing a change that skin
[56:59] isn't the same
[57:00] from where it started you see
[57:04] but because we are we don't have the
[57:06] holy spirit in some of us in our lives
[57:08] we don't have the holy ghost in our life
[57:09] we're just church comers amen
[57:12] we're going to end up just bursting and
[57:14] the whole wine amen just goes to waste
[57:17] and so does the skin amen in other words
[57:20] what you've already heard
[57:21] just goes to waste because you don't
[57:24] allow the holy spirit to mold you in in
[57:27] in in your life the way you should
[57:29] praise god
[57:32] amen amen and so
[57:37] look what look at first john chapter
[57:38] three give me about five more minutes
[57:40] first john chapter 3 says
[57:42] verse 21-22
[57:46] because your prayers they are not going
[57:49] to be answered when you're in
[57:50] disobedience to the word
[57:53] they're just not i mean this is what
[57:54] john says beloved if our heart condemn
[57:56] us not then
[57:57] have we confidence towards god and
[58:00] whatsoever we ask
[58:01] we receive of him because we
[58:04] keep his commandments and do those
[58:08] things that are pleasing
[58:09] in his sight now you know
[58:13] if you're pleasing the lord or not see
[58:16] in verse 21 it says beloved if our heart
[58:18] condemn us not
[58:19] then we have confidence toward god if
[58:22] you have con if you have condemnation
[58:23] for
[58:24] about the things that you do in your
[58:25] home and the things that you allow in
[58:27] your home and
[58:28] those types of things if that condemns
[58:30] you but you don't do anything about it
[58:32] that's between you and god
[58:36] rest assured god is not going to listen
[58:38] to your prayers
[58:40] because there's condemnation in your
[58:41] life
[58:44] now there's a way to get out of that and
[58:47] say lord i'm getting rid of that in my
[58:48] out of my life
[58:49] i'm taking that in my life amen for the
[58:51] example of my children for the example
[58:53] of my wife for the example of my of the
[58:55] church family
[58:56] amen and i'm not going back to that
[58:58] again
[58:59] because i want i don't want my prayers
[59:01] to be hindered anymore
[59:04] that's what it says is that what it says
[59:07] and whatever we ask we receive of him
[59:08] because we keep his commandments and do
[59:10] those things that are pleasing in his
[59:12] sight
[59:14] amen it reminds me of of when joshua
[59:18] uh was fighting the battle there the
[59:20] amorites and it was when moses was still
[59:22] uh
[59:23] with his hands raised up and aaron and
[59:25] er were on
[59:26] each each arm trying to keep his hands
[59:28] raised up but every time that moses
[59:30] lowered his
[59:30] his arms amen the people the israelite
[59:33] people would would start losing the
[59:34] battle but every time he would raise his
[59:36] hands back
[59:37] up the people amen would start winning
[59:39] the battle and
[59:40] out there in the battle was the holy
[59:42] spirit joshua
[59:45] out there fighting with them because the
[59:47] bible said that he would be with us even
[59:50] in us amen and joshua was hearing the
[59:54] word from moses
[59:56] the word of the lord came to moses and
[59:58] joshua got that word and gave it to the
[1:00:00] people and said this is what we need to
[1:00:01] do in order to keep fighting and win
[1:00:03] this battle
[1:00:04] amen and the bible says there in verse
[1:00:08] 14 of that chapter that
[1:00:10] that god that day fought their battles
[1:00:13] for them
[1:00:14] fought that battle for them but i
[1:00:15] thought it was the israelite people
[1:00:17] fighting
[1:00:18] it was it was there it was they were
[1:00:20] fighting but because they were all in
[1:00:21] submission
[1:00:22] all in order all doing exactly what the
[1:00:26] prophet said
[1:00:27] all doing exactly what joshua was
[1:00:28] telling them to do
[1:00:30] the lord stepped in and fought their
[1:00:32] battle right amen
[1:00:34] amen because they were all in order what
[1:00:37] happened on the day of pentecost
[1:00:39] they were all in one accord and the holy
[1:00:43] spirit did
[1:00:44] the rest of it when you do your part god
[1:00:46] will do his
[1:00:48] but when you don't do your part and
[1:00:49] you're slacking and doing your own thing
[1:00:51] adding your own ideas your own
[1:00:52] intellectuals
[1:00:53] into it and think that you can get away
[1:00:56] with things you know and
[1:00:57] on the verge of going into the world and
[1:00:59] all kinds of stuff
[1:01:00] you better believe it god's not going to
[1:01:02] hear your prayer
[1:01:04] god's you're hindering yourself and
[1:01:07] you're hindering
[1:01:08] those around you
[1:01:12] amen brother branham says here with this
[1:01:14] quote i'm finishing
[1:01:16] and the same message why some people
[1:01:18] can't keep the victory
[1:01:19] let us bow our heads while we think of
[1:01:21] the other what is it
[1:01:23] maybe you've been a church member for a
[1:01:24] long time
[1:01:26] but do you really have do you say i've
[1:01:28] got to quit this
[1:01:29] i've got to do this is that the way you
[1:01:31] operate
[1:01:32] look what brother brown said that's
[1:01:34] intellectual
[1:01:36] that's intellectual but is is there
[1:01:39] something
[1:01:40] in you is there something in you the
[1:01:41] real love of god in your heart
[1:01:43] if it isn't why don't you accept it
[1:01:45] today
[1:01:48] why would you accept a substitute have
[1:01:51] all that you got to know that you're a
[1:01:54] christian because you belong to a church
[1:01:58] it is all you've got to know you're a
[1:02:00] christian it's because you're
[1:02:02] you've shouted all you got to know that
[1:02:04] you're a christian because you spoke
[1:02:05] with tongues
[1:02:06] see i believe all these things but i've
[1:02:08] seen witches and wizards speak in
[1:02:10] tongues
[1:02:10] all that you've got to believe maybe
[1:02:12] you've got oil in your hands or a bloody
[1:02:14] face
[1:02:14] you know brother branham keeps going he
[1:02:16] says he says
[1:02:19] brother you're miserable yes why not you
[1:02:22] take the real why take a substitute when
[1:02:24] the pentecostal skies are full of the
[1:02:25] real
[1:02:27] why take a substitute saints why take a
[1:02:30] substitution of just going to church and
[1:02:32] i i listened to brother dale and
[1:02:34] my brother dale preaches the word and i
[1:02:36] know that i'm okay because i i go up
[1:02:38] there to that church
[1:02:39] that's not that won't save you you need
[1:02:42] an experience with god
[1:02:44] yes you have to have your own experience
[1:02:48] with god we appreciate everything in the
[1:02:51] ministry here

[1:02:59] listen to the word that he's trying to
[1:03:01] preach
