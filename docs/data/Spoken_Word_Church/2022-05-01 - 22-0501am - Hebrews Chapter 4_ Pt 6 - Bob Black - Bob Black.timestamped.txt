[1:46] before we get into this little study
[1:48] lord we're just thankful lord to be able
[1:50] to gather around your word once more and
[1:51] we just ask your blessing upon the
[1:53] services today lord and
[1:55] bless us as we study these things out we
[1:57] ask in your name amen
[2:02] so hebrews we got to hebrews 4 11
[2:05] and paul was saying let us labor
[2:08] therefore to enter into that rest
[2:11] lest any man fall after the same example
[2:14] of unbelief
[2:16] and
[2:17] the last few sunday school lessons we
[2:19] were talking about what rest is and
[2:21] we're resting on the promises of christ
[2:23] and resting on
[2:25] his revealed word
[2:28] and
[2:30] when you get when you're as you meditate
[2:32] on these things when you begin to
[2:33] realize why paul said in hebrews 4 12
[2:37] for the word of god is quick and
[2:39] powerful because the word is is what
[2:41] we're resting in and the word is what is
[2:43] actually active in our life and the word
[2:45] is what discerns where we are in our
[2:48] christian walk
[2:49] the word of god is quick and powerful
[2:51] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[2:53] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[2:56] soul and spirit
[2:57] and of the joints and mirror and as a
[2:59] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[3:01] the heart
[3:02] you think even you know as you just
[3:04] reading like through the ten
[3:05] commandments how that the word can
[3:07] discern if there's something wrong in
[3:09] your life um you know and jesus began to
[3:11] magnify those ten commandments when he
[3:13] began to preach about how if you just if
[3:15] there's something wrong in your heart
[3:17] that would make you want to look after a
[3:18] woman you've committed adultery all with
[3:20] already with her in your heart
[3:22] and and and all those things because the
[3:25] word the word is the discerner is there
[3:27] something wrong with me
[3:30] that's why the bible says and just
[3:31] looking at a different translation of
[3:33] that scripture for the word of god is
[3:34] alive and active
[3:37] sharper than any double-edged sword that
[3:39] penetrates even to dividing soul and
[3:41] spirit joints and mirror it judges the
[3:44] thoughts and attitudes of the heart so
[3:46] the word is like
[3:47] it's it's it's uh like a surgeon's knife
[3:50] that can go in and and root out the the
[3:52] problem areas of your thinking and that
[3:54] if if there's a disease in your soul
[3:56] that can root that out and cut it out
[3:58] and begin to do surgery and i've got
[4:00] that picture of a of a of a pendant at
[4:02] center you know
[4:04] crying out to god leaning over the
[4:06] pulpit or the over the uh the chair
[4:08] there that the pew there because that's
[4:10] what the effect that the word has in a
[4:13] in someone's life it begins to transform
[4:15] them to to realize that they need
[4:17] something from god
[4:20] brother obama in the patmos vision he
[4:22] said now paul said that the word came in
[4:24] power as well as voice
[4:26] the word priest actually demonstrated
[4:28] itself
[4:29] like a flaming cutting sword that went
[4:31] to the consciences of men and like a
[4:33] surgeon's knife
[4:34] that cut out the diseases and set
[4:36] captives free
[4:38] everywhere those early believers went
[4:40] they went preaching the gospel and god
[4:42] confirmed that word with signs following
[4:45] the sick were healed devils were cast
[4:47] out and they spoke in new tongues that
[4:49] was the word in action that word has
[4:52] never failed in the mouths of believing
[4:54] christians and in this last age it is
[4:57] here stronger and greater than ever in
[4:59] the true word bride
[5:01] oh little flock you little minority hold
[5:03] on to the word
[5:04] fill your mouth and heart with it and
[5:06] someday god will give you the kingdom
[5:09] that's the word is is not something just
[5:12] like like a dictionary or shakespeare
[5:14] novel or something that we're reading
[5:15] it's actually something that gives us
[5:17] power over the devil that gives us the
[5:20] ability to withstand his you know when
[5:22] the devil begins to come to you with
[5:24] thoughts in your mind the word is what
[5:26] you hold that sword of faith out and it
[5:28] can block everything that the devil's
[5:30] sending to you the shield of faith the
[5:32] sword of the word
[5:34] and so the word is sharper than any
[5:36] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[5:38] dividing asunder of soul and spirit and
[5:41] the joints and mirror and brother
[5:43] branham said it cuts us under the carnal
[5:45] from the spiritual in other words you
[5:47] know you you listen to that sermon
[5:49] anointed ones at the end time and boom
[5:51] all of a sudden the spirit and the soul
[5:53] is divided and you begin to see that the
[5:56] difference between somebody that's just
[5:57] anointed in their spirit and somebody
[5:59] that's really at rest with their soul
[6:02] is somebody maybe that's hopping around
[6:04] in church like like paul said bodily
[6:06] exercise profiteth a little
[6:08] that's great to get anointed in the
[6:10] church service and run up and down the
[6:11] aisles but but you really want that rest
[6:14] down in your soul is what you're after
[6:16] bodily exercise profiteth a little to to
[6:19] jump and run and things that's great to
[6:21] be able to do those things and you see
[6:23] the word when it begins to be preached
[6:25] it divides asunder the soul and the
[6:27] spirit and the body so you know when the
[6:29] word is being preached it has an effect
[6:31] in your life and you begin to understand
[6:33] it gives you confidence and where you
[6:35] are with god
[6:37] cutting us under the cardinal from the
[6:38] spiritual
[6:41] and what does discern mean we cover that
[6:43] a little bit discern means to
[6:44] distinguish so when you're held up when
[6:46] you're faced with the mirror of god's
[6:48] word like i got this little picture of a
[6:50] man being confronted with the law with
[6:52] the old testament the the the ten
[6:54] commandments it it discerns what's in
[6:57] your heart it discerns where you are are
[6:59] you a murderer or you're a thief or
[7:01] you're a liar and you know that's i i
[7:04] love watching videos of street preachers
[7:06] and this is usually one of the things
[7:07] that street preachers will do
[7:09] i have a huge respect for street
[7:11] preachers they'll they'll hold up the
[7:12] law to the people on the street and it
[7:14] can the law will convict people because
[7:16] they begin to realize
[7:18] that if you're a liar and you're a thief
[7:20] or or you've done the things that the
[7:21] ten commandments are saying that you've
[7:23] ever disrespected your mama and daddy
[7:25] and and those kind of things that you're
[7:26] guilty and you need a savior and so the
[7:29] law that's what the word is doing it's
[7:31] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[7:33] the heart now maybe the preacher doesn't
[7:34] even know what's going on in somebody's
[7:37] life
[7:38] but all they're doing is holding up the
[7:39] word to the situation and hope when you
[7:42] hold the word up that begins to discern
[7:44] and in that person's life that there's
[7:45] something wrong
[7:47] so the the preacher is not doing the
[7:48] judging the the word is doing the
[7:50] judging
[7:51] the preacher is not uh doing the
[7:53] discerning necessarily but the the
[7:55] the word is the one the thing that's
[7:57] doing the judging
[7:58] the discerning and discern means to
[8:01] distinguish is it right or not is it
[8:03] righteous or not are you righteous or
[8:05] not
[8:07] and what what the word is it's like a
[8:09] light like a flashlight that shines on
[8:11] the situation as soon as the light comes
[8:13] on you know you go into an old house and
[8:15] you turn the light on and the
[8:16] cockroaches begin to scatter because
[8:18] that's what the you know brother brown
[8:20] priest sermon there's a man here that
[8:21] can turn on the light there's darkness
[8:23] where your your mind is veiled to the
[8:26] truth but when the word is preached then
[8:28] that that's that's the power of the
[8:29] gospel that it can take that veil from
[8:31] over your eye and because you begin to
[8:33] see things to to see
[8:36] uh to see the word as it really is
[8:38] through thy precepts i get understanding
[8:41] david said therefore i hate every false
[8:43] way thy word is a lamp unto my feet and
[8:47] a light unto my path
[8:49] like that story that brother brahm told
[8:51] of the little man that was
[8:52] walking home from church and he held his
[8:54] lantern out in front of him because uh
[8:57] and brother brown asked him how are you
[8:58] going to get home i just i just take one
[9:00] step at a time
[9:02] that's how the word is the word you know
[9:04] you know even in your christian journey
[9:06] when you start when you're born again
[9:07] you don't really know where the end of
[9:09] the journey is but you just keep
[9:10] stepping and stepping until
[9:12] the stature of perfect man begins to
[9:14] open up the capstone begins to open up
[9:17] and you know then
[9:18] and it opens up because you just put one
[9:20] step in front of the other walking and
[9:22] walking by the light of god's word
[9:24] and the light of god's word is so
[9:26] powerful
[9:27] that it can it it everything is is
[9:30] exposed to god
[9:32] paul
[9:33] paul said in in verse 13 neither is
[9:35] there any creature that does not
[9:37] manifest in his sight but all things are
[9:39] naked and open under the eyes of him
[9:41] with whom we have to do and you think
[9:43] about it that god knows everything
[9:44] everything about every kind of
[9:47] how much talon that is ever going to
[9:49] have in his eye how many times a
[9:51] mosquito is going to bat his wings he
[9:53] knows the nature of a dove and he knows
[9:55] the nature of that thing way down in the
[9:56] bottom of the sea that that has a little
[9:58] like that that picture of those scary
[10:00] things down in the bottom of the sea
[10:02] and he he knows what is is as good or
[10:06] great in your heart he knows what's
[10:08] horrible in your heart sitting here this
[10:10] morning he knows whether
[10:12] down in your down in your soul you're
[10:14] righteous or down in your soul you need
[10:15] a redeemer
[10:17] right now
[10:18] everything is exposed to him yes
[10:21] so paul said seeing then
[10:24] seeing that we have a great high priest
[10:26] that is passed into the heavens after
[10:28] he's laid out all of these things
[10:32] we've got this great high priest that
[10:34] has passed into the heavens jesus the
[10:36] son of god
[10:37] let us hold fast our profession
[10:40] now paul talked about your confession a
[10:42] little bit in hebrews chapter three but
[10:44] i just want to reiterate that because
[10:45] this is
[10:46] each one of those little things that
[10:48] paul says
[10:49] is so packed with goodness and richness
[10:52] it's like it's like eating just a rich
[10:53] cake it's so full of good things
[10:56] uh
[10:57] and you know whole fast our profession
[11:00] you think about put put this image in
[11:02] your mind that we've got a high priest
[11:04] and he's seated in the throne of our
[11:06] heart
[11:07] and he's waiting on us to take god's
[11:09] word and then to speak it and to say i
[11:12] believe
[11:14] i believe what has already been spoken i
[11:16] believe what god like what god said i
[11:18] believe what the the uh the prophet of
[11:21] this day said i believe what paul said
[11:24] and when you speak it it it something
[11:26] begins to happen
[11:28] speaking profession and brother roman
[11:30] said that profession and confession are
[11:32] really the same thing but when you speak
[11:35] you're you're speaking based on what you
[11:38] believe
[11:39] when you believe it and you speak it
[11:41] something begins to change
[11:43] and where are you speaking from you're
[11:44] speaking from your heart
[11:47] and you know whatever whatever's in your
[11:48] heart is going to come out of your mouth
[11:50] if you got if you if your heart is
[11:52] filled up with evil things and out of
[11:54] out of that evil heart is is going to
[11:56] come evil things that's why that's why
[11:58] you know believers we don't we don't
[11:59] believe in
[12:00] in cussing and swearing and doing all
[12:02] those kind of things like the people in
[12:04] the world do because that's coming from
[12:05] that's evil conversation coming out of
[12:08] an evil heart but when your heart is
[12:10] transformed out of that that transformed
[12:12] heart is going to come
[12:14] treasures and and a good confession and
[12:17] and a confession where you you're saying
[12:19] all things are possible to them that
[12:21] believe you're saying victory is mine
[12:23] you're saying that
[12:25] uh
[12:26] god
[12:27] uh he's gonna restore
[12:30] everything back from what they what they
[12:31] lost back down through the seven church
[12:33] age you're gonna say things like that
[12:35] that's why
[12:36] matt in matthew chapter 12 jesus said oh
[12:39] generation of vipers how can you being
[12:41] evil speak good things
[12:43] how can you being evil speak good things
[12:47] for out of the abundance of the heart
[12:48] the mouth speaketh amen
[12:50] a good man out of the good treasure of
[12:53] the heart
[12:54] bringeth forth good things and an evil
[12:57] man out of the evil treasure bringeth
[12:59] forth evil things
[13:01] now how you want to get good treasure in
[13:04] your heart is you pack it in by reading
[13:06] the bible so you're packing your oat as
[13:09] we unpack these scriptures these these
[13:11] are like treasures to us and you pack it
[13:13] into your heart now you've got something
[13:15] that you can speak that you can live off
[13:17] of when when trials come and troubles
[13:19] come
[13:20] you could quote back you can speak back
[13:23] that uh he's the same yesterday today
[13:26] and forever he was wounded for my
[13:28] transgressions whatever whatever life
[13:30] throws at you you speak back from your
[13:33] heart knowing that god is able
[13:37] brother braham said and accept god's
[13:39] gift he said now when you believe you
[13:40] were saved setting in your seed out in
[13:42] the wherever you was you accepted it and
[13:44] began to confess
[13:46] and tell people you were saved well you
[13:48] kept on saying i'm saved
[13:51] the people said there ain't no
[13:52] difference in you but you believe there
[13:55] was see now you got that pact in your
[13:57] heart because why do you believe it is
[13:59] because the bible says it and you got it
[14:01] packed in your heart
[14:03] now you're speaking from that treasure
[14:05] he said is that right and you kept with
[14:07] your confession
[14:09] and after a while it worked
[14:11] righteousness
[14:14] all your neighbors and everybody knows
[14:15] you're saved now because you believed it
[14:18] you confessed it
[14:20] why what happened what changed you he's
[14:22] the high priest
[14:24] of your confession
[14:26] sitting at the right hand of the father
[14:28] making good what you're confessing
[14:32] is making good what you speak
[14:36] brother ram said he's sitting at the
[14:37] right hand of the father to make good
[14:39] anything that we confess
[14:42] that he has done
[14:44] he died on the cross for my sins
[14:46] he paid the price for my salvation
[14:49] he's already done it but you got to
[14:51] speak it
[14:52] so you pack it in your heart
[14:54] and you believe it and then you speak it
[14:57] he cannot do nothing for us until first
[14:59] we confess that he has done it and act
[15:02] upon it
[15:03] he can't do not one thing for us till we
[15:05] accept it and say that we have accepted
[15:08] it and believe it
[15:10] and testify of it
[15:15] i i just ran through and and pulled out
[15:17] all these things just in one it just
[15:18] kind of lumped them together that
[15:19] brother ram said about your confession
[15:21] he said god can't do nothing to you till
[15:23] first you confess that he is
[15:26] then when you confess it then believe it
[15:29] act upon it and stay with it and god
[15:31] will bring you out
[15:34] he said jesus christ is sitting at the
[15:36] right hand of the father to accept you
[15:39] for he's sitting there the high priest
[15:40] of your confession to make good before
[15:42] the father anything that he died for
[15:44] that you're confessing that he done
[15:48] every sinner is saved tonight in the
[15:50] sight in the sight of jehovah god but
[15:52] will never do you any good until you
[15:54] accept it
[15:56] and believe it
[15:58] and confess it and then he's the high
[16:00] priest of your confession to make it
[16:02] right before god
[16:04] jesus is the high priest of your
[16:06] confession whatever you confess that
[16:10] he's doing he'll do
[16:14] whatever you say
[16:18] and three kinds of believers brother
[16:19] said we haven't got no thought coming
[16:21] it's what he said
[16:23] now if i read in the bible what you say
[16:25] it
[16:26] and i believe it and then i speak it
[16:29] something's got to happen
[16:32] he said you deny your own thinking
[16:35] that means if the if you see the cloudy
[16:37] skies and the winds and the waves going
[16:39] everywhere it doesn't matter if you see
[16:42] your children leaving and sickness in
[16:44] your home it doesn't matter all that
[16:46] matters is what god said
[16:49] you just say what he says
[16:53] that's really confession
[16:55] confession means to say the same thing
[16:59] if i confess that a certain thing taken
[17:01] place i say the same thing that taken
[17:04] place
[17:04] that's what real confession is
[17:07] and he's the high priest of our
[17:08] confession see
[17:10] saying the same thing god said see that
[17:13] makes it right because you're just
[17:15] repeating god's word
[17:19] of course you know how do you know what
[17:20] to say
[17:22] if you don't get in the word
[17:24] and you see why god's bringing us up you
[17:26] start off speaking from a baby you start
[17:28] i said you come out of the egg
[17:30] but you don't really know what to say
[17:32] and then the words get packed in the
[17:34] word gets packed in until god brings you
[17:36] to a place where he can open the seals
[17:38] and really open the word up to you and
[17:41] then you're getting to a place where you
[17:42] know what god wants done with the word
[17:45] you know whether god wants to fill
[17:47] people with the holy ghost and you know
[17:48] how things begin to work
[17:50] and so you're coming to a place where
[17:52] you know how to speak it
[17:55] you started from an egg see wherever you
[17:58] are you come out of that egg just like
[18:00] like an eagle does like you know like we
[18:02] stood it out in the greatest battle ever
[18:04] fought you come out that eagle comes out
[18:06] with its mouth and that's how you come
[18:08] out with your mouth by speaking by what
[18:11] you say
[18:14] and accept god's gift brother brown said
[18:15] now healing is not something that you
[18:17] just say well i yeah i believe it i
[18:19] believe it now that's all right if
[18:21] that's the best you can do just mentally
[18:23] or just say well yeah i see it i believe
[18:25] that i accept it then if you accept it
[18:28] on this basis
[18:29] keep saying it over and over
[18:32] say it out loud
[18:35] say it over and over
[18:37] just keep saying
[18:39] i'm healed i'm healed say it until
[18:42] actually you believe it
[18:45] and when you believe it
[18:47] then it's going to take place
[18:50] don't have a negative testimony
[18:54] every time when you confess well i still
[18:56] feel bad today i guess i you go right
[18:59] straight back in the same rut that you
[19:01] was in the beginning there's not a man
[19:03] or a woman in here that is baptized with
[19:05] the holy spirit but what would start
[19:06] your confession i believe i've lost the
[19:08] spirit i believe it's gone for me i
[19:10] believe you'll go right down
[19:13] listen close
[19:15] you'll never live above your confession
[19:18] that's a that's a pretty weighty
[19:20] statement that you'll never live above
[19:22] your confession so if we want to go high
[19:25] let's keep our confession high
[19:28] that i believe god is with us i believe
[19:30] he ain't left us i believe he's here in
[19:33] the building this morning
[19:36] i believe that the bible says that he's
[19:39] nigh you that the word is even in your
[19:41] mouth
[19:42] that you don't have to go running around
[19:44] looking for him that he's here
[19:47] and you you speak that and something
[19:49] will begin to change
[19:55] that's why romans chapter 10 says but
[19:57] the righteousness
[19:59] which is of faith
[20:00] speaketh isn't that interesting that you
[20:03] use those words
[20:04] that faith speaks
[20:06] on this wise
[20:08] say not in thine heart who shall ascend
[20:10] into heaven that is the being cry christ
[20:12] down from above
[20:14] or who shall ascend into the deep that
[20:16] is to bring up christ again from the
[20:17] dead
[20:19] but what sayeth it
[20:20] the word is nighty
[20:23] even in thy mouth
[20:24] you've already packed the word into your
[20:26] heart i just speak it
[20:29] and then that is the word of faith
[20:32] which we preach preach
[20:34] that if thou shalt confess with thy
[20:36] mouth the lord jesus
[20:38] and shall believe in thine heart that
[20:40] god hath raised him from the dead
[20:43] thou shalt be saved
[20:45] for with the heart man believeth unto
[20:47] and unto righteousness
[20:49] and with the mouth confession is made
[20:52] unto salvation
[20:54] for the scripture saith whosoever
[20:56] believeth on him
[20:57] shall not be ashamed
[21:00] you're not going to be ashamed after
[21:02] this word is packed into your heart to
[21:04] say i believe it
[21:06] to testify to your co-workers to testify
[21:09] to your friends
[21:10] to share the gospel when when bad things
[21:13] come your way to say i believe that god
[21:15] is still with me because his word says
[21:18] it is
[21:19] says he is
[21:21] even in first john john said hereby know
[21:24] you the spirit of god of god every
[21:25] spirit that confesseth
[21:28] that speaks that revelation a present
[21:31] tense revelation amen that jesus christ
[21:34] is
[21:35] come in the flesh is of god
[21:38] that's how you know
[21:39] that's how you can discern is every
[21:41] spirit that speaks to a present tense
[21:44] revelation of jesus christ
[21:46] and every spirit that confesseth not
[21:48] that jesus christ has come in the flesh
[21:50] is not of god and this is that spirit of
[21:52] antichrist
[21:54] wherever you have heard that it should
[21:55] come and even now already is in the
[21:56] world
[21:59] and hebrews 11 that we're making our way
[22:01] to said by him therefore let us offer
[22:03] the sacrifice of praise to god
[22:05] continually what's the sacrifice of
[22:07] praise
[22:08] the fruit of your lips
[22:10] the fruit of your lips
[22:12] is your sacrifice of praise giving
[22:14] thanks to his name
[22:16] now i i think it's so so interesting
[22:19] that even from from your very first
[22:22] the the very beginning of your christian
[22:25] journey you're going to start out
[22:26] speaking
[22:28] you know so many times when brother
[22:29] branham would uh when he would baptize
[22:31] somebody he would just if you go back
[22:33] and study out the way he would baptize
[22:35] somebody he would he would he would
[22:37] weave in there that is he's doing it
[22:40] upon their confession
[22:42] you know
[22:44] think about the stories of where brother
[22:45] ryan would say that
[22:46] that one lady she said i want to be
[22:48] dunked
[22:49] and he said you're not you're not ready
[22:51] to be baptized
[22:52] because
[22:53] what kind of confession did she have
[22:55] that's right
[22:56] maybe look back in your own journey i
[22:57] remember growing up i hear people say
[22:59] well i'm i i i yeah i think it would be
[23:01] cool to be baptized and just thinking in
[23:03] myself i i i don't know if you
[23:05] understand what it is
[23:07] so when you understand what you're doing
[23:10] and you have a confession that i believe
[23:12] jesus christ died for my sins and you
[23:15] you're going down in the water based on
[23:16] that confession you see when you come up
[23:19] something's going to happen and you look
[23:21] at all these places where brother ram
[23:22] would he said upon your confession these
[23:24] are places where he's baptizing somebody
[23:27] upon your confession of your faith
[23:29] and your consecration to our lord i
[23:31] baptist baptize thee my beloved sister
[23:34] upon your confession of the son of god i
[23:37] baptize and baptize thee
[23:39] so then i said in another place he said
[23:41] upon your confession of your faith upon
[23:43] your confession of your sins and your
[23:45] faith in the son of god i baptize thee
[23:48] my beloved brother in the name of the
[23:49] lord jesus christ
[23:51] i said that's the way i baptized he's
[23:53] baptized because of your confession your
[23:55] confession matters amen when you're
[23:57] going down in the water speaking
[23:59] something that you know why you're there
[24:01] and it's not just because somebody told
[24:04] you to go or
[24:05] because that something's happened in
[24:07] your heart and you believe and you're
[24:09] speaking it
[24:11] and that's this there was this little
[24:12] brother uh
[24:14] edward colvin was the 17th person that
[24:16] brother brown was baptizing there on the
[24:18] river on the
[24:20] ohio river
[24:21] and look at the way that he he said he
[24:24] baptized him
[24:26] he said edward do you know what i'm
[24:27] doing now i am baptizing you see he's
[24:30] asking him do you know
[24:32] what i'm doing
[24:34] because if you know
[24:36] something something it changes
[24:38] everything
[24:39] i said i'm baptizing you showing you to
[24:42] show into this audience out here that
[24:43] you've accepted christ as your personal
[24:46] savior
[24:47] when i baptize you in the name of jesus
[24:49] christ you take on his name
[24:51] you rise for a new life
[24:53] and when you leave here you're to walk a
[24:56] new life
[24:57] do you understand that edward
[25:01] and he said i do
[25:04] bow your head and he said heavenly
[25:06] father as this young man has
[25:08] confessed his faith in you
[25:11] see he's speaking out what he's been
[25:13] packing in
[25:14] and as thou has commissioned to us to go
[25:17] into all the world and preach the gospel
[25:19] and and so forth and he went on and
[25:21] baptized him and that light came down
[25:23] out of heaven and and a voice spoke as
[25:26] john the baptist for run i this
[25:29] his message this message will full run
[25:31] my second coming
[25:35] so brother branham said
[25:38] well we're going on to the next
[25:39] scripture
[25:41] for we have a verse 15 for we have a
[25:43] high priest
[25:45] we've got a high priest which cannot be
[25:47] touched with the feelings of our
[25:48] infirmities
[25:50] but was in all points tempted like we we
[25:53] are like as we are yet without sin
[25:57] and brother i'm saying how can i
[25:59] overcome temptation was for him you know
[26:01] that
[26:02] the bible said he was tempted in all
[26:04] points like we are
[26:06] yet without sin
[26:08] he was tempted by drinking and in other
[26:10] words he he he knows what we're going
[26:12] through
[26:14] no matter what your place in life we've
[26:16] got somebody that's touched by the
[26:17] feelings of our infirmities that that
[26:19] realizes that our predicament in life
[26:21] yes he was tempted by women
[26:24] he was tempted by everything that could
[26:26] be tempted by
[26:28] he was tempted by everything that we are
[26:30] he was a man and yet you couldn't put a
[26:33] mark on him
[26:38] in verse 15 for we have not in high
[26:40] priest which cannot be touched with the
[26:41] feelings of our infirmities but was in
[26:43] all points tempted like as we are yet
[26:45] without sin let us therefore come boldly
[26:48] unto the throne of grace
[26:50] that we may obtain mercy and find grace
[26:53] to help in time of need
[26:56] we've got a high priest that has given
[26:58] us rest
[27:00] that is now laboring within us
[27:03] that
[27:04] that uh that understands what we're
[27:06] going through
[27:09] a high priest that's
[27:10] packing us full of of good treasures
[27:13] from his word
[27:14] so why not come boldly if you have need
[27:16] of anything
[27:18] if his word says that you have access to
[27:20] something
[27:21] let's speak it and go forward and come
[27:23] boldly yeah
[27:26] and brother in hebrews chapter five and
[27:28] six that message they preached and we'll
[27:30] be closing there in just a moment he
[27:31] said these five first five chapters
[27:34] are positionally placing jesus as high
[27:37] priest
[27:39] god in sundry times and divers manners
[27:41] spake to the fathers through the
[27:42] prophets but in this last day through
[27:43] his son jesus
[27:45] then on down to the ending up of the
[27:46] fifth chapter we find him represented as
[27:48] melchizedek
[27:50] who had no beginning of days
[27:53] no ending of your life but continually a
[27:55] priest forever
[27:57] think of who was this great man we'll
[27:59] get it in about two more chapters the
[28:01] entire life of him we're going to study
[28:03] this great man who met abraham
[28:06] who never had any papa
[28:08] never had any mama
[28:10] he never had any time he ever begin life
[28:12] or he never will have a time that he
[28:14] will ever in life and he met abraham
[28:17] coming from the slaughters of the king
[28:19] so he's he's positionally placed jesus
[28:22] christ as the high priest
[28:24] and where is he at he's he's working in
[28:26] the throne of your heart now picture
[28:27] this picture of this crowd the old
[28:29] testament high priest now he's he's he's
[28:32] he's he's taken your confession
[28:35] the high priest of your confession and
[28:36] he's working with it he's making it
[28:38] bring it to pass in your life
[28:41] doing something enthroned on your heart
[28:44] as we read through hebrews the first
[28:46] part of hebrews 5 before we close here
[28:48] he said in hebrews 5 for every high
[28:50] priest taken from among men as ordained
[28:52] for men and things pertaining to god
[28:54] that he may offer both gifts and
[28:56] sacrifices for sins who can have
[28:58] compassion on the ignorant and on them
[29:00] that are out of the way for that he
[29:02] himself also is compassed with infirmity
[29:04] and by reason hereof he all is for the
[29:06] people so also for himself to offer for
[29:08] sins and no man taketh his honor unto
[29:10] himself but he that is called of god as
[29:13] was aaron
[29:14] so also christ glorified not himself to
[29:17] be made in high priest but he that said
[29:19] unto him thou art my son today have i
[29:21] begotten thee
[29:23] as he sayeth also in another place
[29:25] thou art a priest forever after the
[29:27] order of melchizedek the musicians can
[29:29] go ahead and come forward who in the
[29:31] days of his flesh when he had offered up
[29:33] prayers and supplications with strong
[29:35] crying and tears unto him that was able
[29:37] to save him from death and was hurt and
[29:38] that he feared though he were a son yet
[29:41] learned he obedience by the things which
[29:43] he suffered
[29:44] and being made perfect he became the
[29:45] author of eternal salvation of all them
[29:47] that obey him
[29:49] call of god and high priest after the
[29:51] order of melchizedek of whom we have
[29:53] many things to say and hard to be
[29:55] uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing
[29:57] for when the time you ought for when for
[29:59] the time you ought to be teachers you
[30:01] have need that one teach you again which
[30:03] be the first principles of the oracles
[30:04] of god and that becomes such as have
[30:06] need of milk and not of strong meat
[30:09] for everyone that useth milk is
[30:10] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[30:12] for he is a babe
[30:14] but strong meat belongeth to them that
[30:16] are of full age
[30:17] even those who by reason of use have
[30:19] their senses exercised to discern both
[30:21] good and evil
[30:23] god bless you
[30:44] so
[30:57] you
