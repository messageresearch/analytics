[0:03] foreign
[0:14] we're so grateful to be able to gather
[0:16] together Lord this morning and pray Lord
[0:18] that you'll just bless us as we study
[0:19] these things out that Paul spoke of Lord
[0:21] and bless our services today brother
[0:23] wade back there studying Lord God
[0:25] prepare our hearts and our minds to
[0:26] receive what you have in store for us
[0:28] today we ask in your name
[0:31] so we almost made it well we uh we we
[0:34] made it through Hebrews 9 but I just
[0:36] wanted to back up and just kind of um
[0:37] you know sometimes there's little
[0:38] scriptures you just kind of want to sit
[0:40] on for a little bit and
[0:42] um so back up to verse 15 and just kind
[0:45] of make our way back through to the
[0:47] beginning of verse 10 or the chapter 10.
[0:49] so Paul was saying in in Hebrews chapter
[0:51] 9 he says for this cause he is the
[0:53] mediator of the New Testament
[0:56] that by means of death for the
[0:58] Redemption of the transgressions that
[1:00] were under the first testament they
[1:02] which are called might receive the
[1:04] promise of Eternal inheritance
[1:07] for where a testament is there must also
[1:10] of necessity be the death of the
[1:11] testator
[1:12] for a testament is a force after men are
[1:15] dead otherwise it is of no strength at
[1:18] all while the testator liveth
[1:21] now you think even in the natural
[1:24] when someone dies then you go uh stand
[1:27] before the lawyer or whatever and the
[1:29] wheel is red and you get access to the
[1:31] things that they've left for you to have
[1:32] access to
[1:33] and in the same way when Christ died
[1:36] then you got access to you you got
[1:38] access to your inheritance that that was
[1:42] uh was there for you from before the
[1:43] foundation of the world but just want to
[1:45] kind of meditate on what that means that
[1:47] your inheritance now
[1:49] um you know if you're if you were
[1:51] reading the last will and testament you
[1:53] can see that this is really a great
[1:55] picture because it shows that your will
[1:57] uh you know it could be a house or money
[1:59] or a car or got a key to to something
[2:02] and it's all granted and then when the
[2:04] wheel is red and now you've got access
[2:07] to that
[2:08] now brother Brown said in in adoption
[2:11] number three we read this last time he
[2:12] said I inherited something what
[2:14] inheritance there had to be somebody
[2:16] leave me an inheritance why you say
[2:18] Jesus left you an inheritance beg your
[2:20] pardon Jesus never left me an
[2:22] inheritance Jesus Jesus never left you
[2:24] an inheritance he only came down and
[2:26] paid for your inheritance brought you to
[2:28] your inheritance but your name was put
[2:31] on the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[2:33] foundation of the world God gave you
[2:35] your inheritance your inheritance was
[2:36] first here's the way they try to make it
[2:39] God said well there's a lot of people
[2:41] lost I don't want them be saved so I'll
[2:43] I'll send down Jesus I'll send that
[2:46] Jesus down and perhaps maybe if
[2:49] somebody'll feel sorry I know what I've
[2:51] done and get saved I wouldn't run my
[2:53] office like that even as poor as I do
[2:55] run it sometimes then I wouldn't do it
[2:57] like that how about God so God had the
[3:00] inheritance all prepared for you before
[3:02] you were born he knew who was going to
[3:04] receive it he had it all planned out
[3:07] so if we just meditate on some of those
[3:09] scriptures that we read last time last
[3:11] last Sunday in Proverbs 13 it says a
[3:14] good man leaveth that inheritance to his
[3:16] children's children and the wealth of
[3:19] the sinner is laid up for the just
[3:21] and Ephesians 1 says in whom also we
[3:23] have obtained an inheritance being
[3:25] predestinated according to the purpose
[3:26] of him who work with all things after
[3:28] the counsel of his own will
[3:30] in Ephesians Verse 18 says the eyes of
[3:33] your understanding being enlightened
[3:35] that you may know what is the hope of
[3:36] his calling and what the riches of the
[3:38] glory of his inheritance in the Saints
[3:41] so God wants us to know what our
[3:43] inheritance is he just doesn't want us
[3:46] to go stumbling around wondering what we
[3:48] have access to and I believe when you
[3:51] when you realize what you're what you
[3:52] have what you should have a right to
[3:54] then you'll do like you do like Caleb
[3:57] did and say I'm going to fight for my
[3:58] Mountain because it's mine
[4:00] you you have a right to it in Titus for
[4:04] chapter three he said that being
[4:05] justified by his grace we should be made
[4:07] heirs according to the hope of eternal
[4:09] life
[4:10] and Romans 8 says and if children then
[4:12] heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with
[4:15] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[4:17] that we may be also glorified together
[4:21] in Luke chapter 12
[4:23] there's an interesting story about an
[4:25] inheritance and and Jesus tells this
[4:28] story he said
[4:29] as he was you know speaking to the crowd
[4:32] one of the companies said I need a
[4:34] master speak to my brother that he
[4:36] divide the inheritance with me so
[4:38] there's a somebody in the in the crowd
[4:39] talking to Jesus and he's got a
[4:41] situation where his his his parents or
[4:44] his fathers died or whatever the
[4:46] situation is and now there's a little
[4:48] argument over who gets the inheritance
[4:49] and he said unto him man who made me a
[4:53] judge or a divider over you and he said
[4:56] unto them take heed and beware of
[4:57] covetousness for a man's life consists
[5:00] not in the abundance of the things which
[5:02] he possesseth
[5:03] so now he's he's shifting their thinking
[5:05] from from things carnal to to things
[5:08] spiritual you you think your inheritance
[5:10] is you're so worried about how much
[5:12] money or land you're going to get but
[5:13] what about what about where your soul is
[5:15] going to go when you die
[5:16] and he spake a parable unto them saying
[5:18] the ground of a certain rich man brought
[5:20] forth plentifully and he thought within
[5:23] himself saying what shall I do because I
[5:25] have no room where to bestow my fruits
[5:27] and he said this what I do I will pull
[5:29] down my Barns and build greater and then
[5:31] will I bestow all my fruits and my goods
[5:33] he was so concerned with the natural
[5:34] that he was going to go out and I got to
[5:36] build a bigger Barn so I'm going to tear
[5:38] down what I've got and build something
[5:39] greater and I will say to my soul
[5:42] Soul thou has much Goods laid up for
[5:45] many years take thine ease eat drink and
[5:48] be merry
[5:49] but God said unto him thou fool this
[5:51] night thy Soul shall be required of thee
[5:53] then whose shall those things be which
[5:55] thou has provided so is he that layeth
[5:58] up treasure for himself and is not rich
[6:00] toward God now see he wanted he was so
[6:03] concerned about uh uh
[6:05] uh the the things of this Earth and then
[6:08] Jesus began to tell a parable about
[6:10] somebody that thought he was going to
[6:11] have a lot of years left a lot uh uh uh
[6:15] many many more years to to kind of enjoy
[6:18] the fruits of his labors and all the
[6:19] those big barns that he built and that
[6:22] night he died
[6:24] what's your inheritance your inherence
[6:26] is your inheritance in Christ is eternal
[6:29] life
[6:30] there's another another Parable that in
[6:32] Mark chapter 10 when he was going forth
[6:34] out of the way there came one running
[6:36] and kneeled him and asked him good
[6:37] Master what shall I do that I may
[6:39] inherit
[6:40] eternal life
[6:42] and Jesus said unto him why call us thou
[6:44] me good
[6:45] there's none good but one that is God
[6:48] they all know it's the Commandments
[6:51] do not commit adultery they're not
[6:53] killed and I steal do not bear false
[6:55] witness they're for all not honor thy
[6:56] father and mother and he answered and
[6:58] said unto him master all these have I
[7:00] observed for my youth then Jesus
[7:02] beholding him loved him and said unto
[7:04] him one thing thou lack us go thy way so
[7:06] whatsoever thou Hast and give to the
[7:08] poor and thou shalt have treasure in
[7:10] heaven and come take up the cross and
[7:12] follow me and he was sad at that saying
[7:14] and went away grieved for he had great
[7:16] possessions a lot of stuff on Earth
[7:18] but what about in heaven and Jesus
[7:20] looked around about and saith unto his
[7:22] disciples how hardly shall they that
[7:24] have riches enter into the kingdom of
[7:26] God now what makes it hard for a rich
[7:28] man to see because you're looking around
[7:30] at all the positions all the stuff you
[7:32] got you got you can one one click you
[7:34] can buy something on Amazon you can sit
[7:37] in your easy chair and not even get up
[7:38] when the postman brings your box to your
[7:40] door and you've got all those things and
[7:42] you can you you you are it's so easy in
[7:45] this layout of CNAs to get our mind off
[7:47] of off of off of what's really important
[7:50] to lay up your Treasures in Heaven and
[7:52] that's why Jesus said where your
[7:53] treasure is that's where your heart is
[7:55] if you're if you're so concerned about
[7:57] the natural life then you're not going
[7:59] to be concerned about the spiritual life
[8:00] but if you're concerned about eternal
[8:02] life then a lot of times the things of
[8:04] this Earth will begin to fade away
[8:07] in Matthew 19 he said then answered
[8:09] Peter and said well unto him behold what
[8:11] we have forsaken all
[8:14] and follow thee what shall we have
[8:16] therefore what are we going to get
[8:18] are we going to get uh you know
[8:21] who knows where his mind was going and
[8:23] Jesus said unto them verily I say unto
[8:25] you that ye which have followed me and
[8:28] the Regeneration when the son of man
[8:30] shall sit in the Throne of his glory he
[8:32] also shall sit upon twelve Thrones
[8:34] judging the 12 tribes of Israel
[8:36] and everyone that had forsaken houses or
[8:39] Brethren her sisters her father a mother
[8:41] or wife or children or lands for my
[8:43] namesake shall receive in hundred
[8:44] hundredfold and shall inherit
[8:47] everlasting life
[8:49] but many that are first shall be last
[8:51] and the last shall be first and then he
[8:53] goes on to talk about the 11th Hour
[8:54] worker
[8:56] but in Revelations chapter 21 tells you
[8:58] what you're going to inherit he that
[9:00] over overcometh shall inherit all things
[9:03] now that's a pretty good selling point
[9:05] for the gospel isn't it
[9:07] if you can overcome your pride and your
[9:09] ego and the things of this life the
[9:11] trials of Life and Overcoming Christ and
[9:13] get get in Christ be born again you're
[9:16] going to inherit all things amen what
[9:20] does inherit mean inherent means to
[9:22] receive a lot like uh somebody dies and
[9:25] they're going to say this one's going to
[9:26] get this this is going to get this and
[9:28] so when when uh when the when the wheel
[9:30] is red when the testament's read you
[9:32] hear your name called and oh great I get
[9:35] this this is what you're going to get to
[9:37] receive the portion assigned to you now
[9:39] so you're a portion your portion is is
[9:42] what all these scriptures that we've
[9:43] just been reading
[9:45] to receive an allotted portion receive
[9:47] as one's own or as a possession to
[9:49] become partaker of to obtain so your
[9:52] inheritance means that it's yours you
[9:55] you have access to it you it wouldn't it
[9:58] be great if you were listening to to the
[9:59] law you read the will or whatever and
[10:01] they say well you gotta you got a new
[10:03] house or or and then you you'd go out of
[10:06] there skipping with joy because wow I've
[10:08] got I've got some money or I've got a
[10:10] new car or whatever well that's uh think
[10:14] about how Joyful We should be when we
[10:15] realize what God has given to us
[10:19] now now here's a great definition of
[10:21] inheritance from the Cambridge
[10:22] Dictionary definition an inheritance is
[10:25] money land or possessions received from
[10:27] someone after the person has died but it
[10:30] also means the characteristics received
[10:33] from your parents through their genes
[10:35] now you think about how that we've
[10:37] inherited through Christ we've inherited
[10:39] all things but we've inherited his
[10:42] characteristics through the new birth
[10:44] that his he will change our thinking and
[10:46] change our life to be like him
[10:48] change change it change our makeup so
[10:51] that we're actually the the
[10:52] manifestation of Christ in this age and
[10:54] the age that we're living in
[10:57] so in Galatians chapter 4 Paul said even
[10:59] so we when we were children were in
[11:01] bondage under the elements of the world
[11:03] but when the fullness of the time was
[11:05] come God sent forth his son made of a
[11:07] woman made under the law to redeem them
[11:09] that were under the law that we might
[11:11] receive the adoption of sons and because
[11:13] you are Sons God had sent forth a spirit
[11:15] of his son into your hearts crying I
[11:17] have a father wherefore Thou Art no more
[11:20] a servant but a son and if a son then an
[11:23] heir of God through Christ so by the new
[11:26] birth we have access to all these
[11:27] promises that that God has has laid out
[11:31] for us
[11:33] foreign
[11:35] and in Romans chapter 8 verse 15 also
[11:38] now you think about uh an heir a joint
[11:42] Heir just to actually sit on the throne
[11:44] with Christ and be an heir to everything
[11:46] jointly with him now I I got an example
[11:48] as an example you know I don't watch the
[11:51] royal family or whatever but it's just
[11:53] something to kind of think about as an
[11:54] example
[11:55] um you this these are all the Heirs of
[11:58] the royal family over there in England
[12:00] and so you know the queen just died and
[12:03] sold out now Prince Charles and he's now
[12:06] the king um and and he's got he's got
[12:08] everything that the queen had because it
[12:11] was it was it was her wheel or whatever
[12:12] and uh so he's got he's got the throne
[12:16] he's got the kingdom he's he's got he's
[12:18] inherited
[12:19] everything that goes with that title of
[12:22] being the the monarchy of the king of
[12:25] England and now all of these people here
[12:28] are in line
[12:29] uh Prince William he's going to be next
[12:31] in line if if King Charles were to die
[12:33] if if Charles dies then the Testament
[12:36] will go you've got access to everything
[12:38] that I had you've got my name you've got
[12:41] my title you've got all the benefits and
[12:44] privileges there too and all the way
[12:45] down to this little fella who's sitting
[12:47] there I think his name is George if I
[12:49] remember right and uh now now George
[12:52] he's a little fella so he's got he's got
[12:55] to come to a place where he can know
[12:56] what to do with all that
[12:58] now that's the same way that God does
[12:59] with us he doesn't just pile it on to
[13:01] you all at once he starts off a little
[13:03] bit by giving you the near birth and you
[13:05] grow into it so that you have uh to see
[13:07] that you're going to be responsible you
[13:09] know that I I I think it's interesting
[13:11] how that even that royal family over
[13:13] there they put their kids through school
[13:14] and they they make them go to the
[13:16] military and fly a helicopter or
[13:18] whatever so they nerd they start
[13:20] building some character they know
[13:21] they're not just
[13:23] um necessarily just spoiled brats they
[13:26] uh
[13:27] they they've been they they know how to
[13:30] conduct themselves and how to how to
[13:31] serve the people the people and that
[13:33] kind of stuff so you know brother
[13:35] Raymond said in the return in Jubilee He
[13:37] said yes sir it's time to return
[13:39] return to what brother random return
[13:41] back to the organization I come out of
[13:43] no return back to your inheritance The
[13:46] Inheritance that our father left us
[13:49] how did we what kind of an inheritance
[13:51] did he leave weight ye and the City of
[13:53] Jerusalem until you're endued with power
[13:55] from on high that's the inheritance not
[13:58] go join this one and go join that one go
[14:01] join this one wait till the power wait
[14:03] till the power comes from on high
[14:05] how long until one day two days wait
[14:08] until don't take some little emotion
[14:11] some little frustration wait there until
[14:13] you are dead and buried and born again
[14:15] or at the new Anew in Christ Jesus and
[14:18] every pulsation of your life beats out
[14:20] Jesus Christ
[14:21] so you can see the Life of Christ
[14:24] reflected right in your living the way
[14:26] you go yes sir till you can find that
[14:29] power like they had back there in the
[14:31] beginning because that's your
[14:32] inheritance in Christ the same life the
[14:35] same power you're going to do the
[14:36] Greater Works because he said he said
[14:38] that's that's your inheritance the signs
[14:41] and wonders will follow them that
[14:42] believe that's your inheritance because
[14:44] eternal life in Christ is your
[14:45] inheritance
[14:46] so just like little King George you you
[14:49] start off with the down payment of your
[14:51] of that the earnest of your inheritance
[14:53] in Ephesians chapter 1 verse 14.
[14:56] says in whom you also trusted after that
[14:58] you heard the word of Truth The Gospel
[15:00] of your salvation and whom also after
[15:02] that you believed you were sealed with
[15:03] that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the
[15:05] earnest of our inheritance until the
[15:07] Redemption of the purchased possession
[15:09] unto the praise of his glory
[15:11] now brother Brown said to hear ye him in
[15:14] the Old Testament a father owned a great
[15:16] portion of ground and he had hired
[15:19] servants all around little places and
[15:21] houses or tents that watched over his
[15:23] flock now when a child was born into
[15:25] this home the father did not have time
[15:27] to take care of the son the way that he
[15:29] should so he'd go and hire a tutor or a
[15:32] razor someone to educate the child
[15:35] all right here's where I think that the
[15:36] Pentecostal Church made their mistake
[15:38] when that son was born into the family
[15:40] he was a son at Birth but his
[15:42] inheritance was not yet determined it
[15:44] depended on his character so though
[15:46] being a son than if he was a disobedient
[15:48] son he would not inherit anything but
[15:51] still he was a son but if he was an
[15:53] obedient son he was heir to all things
[15:56] and we've been taught not only through
[15:58] Pentecostal Realms but through the
[15:59] Holiness group and the Baptist and what
[16:02] more that when we're born again we're
[16:04] sons of God
[16:05] that's true but that yet that's just the
[16:08] beginning then it's your character from
[16:10] then on what means the difference
[16:14] now everything here's another I'm just
[16:16] running through some examples of getting
[16:18] your inheritance and the Bible talks
[16:20] about every the shemitah was every seven
[16:22] years and you'd get you'd get to uh
[16:24] somebody that was uh out of their
[16:26] inheritance would would be able to go
[16:28] partially free every seven years your
[16:31] debts would be forgiven the ad the land
[16:33] would lie follow and the private land
[16:35] Holdings could be go back to to sale and
[16:38] Staples such as food stores and
[16:40] perennial Harvest to be freely
[16:41] redistributed and accessible to all and
[16:43] and if you if you went into into bondage
[16:47] with uh where the having married a wife
[16:50] previously then you could go back to
[16:52] that wife but if you married a wife that
[16:53] was a slave while you were during that
[16:55] seven years you cannot take that wife
[16:57] with you and those kind of things but
[16:59] after at the end of the 50 years now I'm
[17:02] going I know I'm kind of running through
[17:04] fast but I'm just kind of summarizing
[17:06] The Inheritance at the end of the uh in
[17:09] Leviticus 25 it says Thou shalt number
[17:11] seven sevenths of sabbaths of years
[17:13] under these seven times seven seven
[17:14] years in the space of the seven sabbaths
[17:17] of his years shall be unto thee 40 and
[17:18] nine years then shalt thou cause a
[17:20] number of the The Trumpet of the Jubilee
[17:22] to sound on the tenth day of the seventh
[17:24] month and the day of atonement shall you
[17:26] make the trumpet sound throughout all
[17:27] your land so when that trumpet sounded
[17:30] you could go completely back to your
[17:32] inheritance I see that's typing what
[17:34] brother random's message was to to bring
[17:36] us back to the original Faith to
[17:38] original to the original possession of
[17:41] what you're to to take you back to full
[17:43] inheritance
[17:44] now we're speaking of inheritance full
[17:46] inheritance full inheritance is not just
[17:49] Redemption of your soul but full
[17:50] inheritance takes you all the way back
[17:52] to to full communion with Christ which
[17:55] is that slide we were looking at last
[17:57] last uh last Sunday where full
[18:00] inheritance takes you back to eternal
[18:02] life and the mind and body and subject
[18:03] to the word and the virtues of God on
[18:05] display all of this and speaking
[18:08] conditions
[18:09] and one is in communion with God and a
[18:11] supernatural understanding of
[18:12] Supernatural things and the ability to
[18:14] discern truth from error no matter how
[18:17] close it is and and fortification behind
[18:20] God's word because God's going to have a
[18:21] bride that won't be like Eve that she's
[18:23] not going to be fooled by something the
[18:25] devil tells her and an anointed life and
[18:27] dominion over the Earth and full
[18:29] Redemption for soul spirit and body
[18:32] Christ completely manifested in you and
[18:35] all the way to a body change now see
[18:37] that's a summary of what your
[18:38] inheritance is
[18:40] so now that was going back to this story
[18:43] that I kind of alluded to earlier that
[18:44] in Joshua chapter 14 when they when they
[18:47] came out uh crossed over the river
[18:48] Jordan the children of Judah came unto
[18:51] Joshua and gilgal and Caleb the son of
[18:53] jeffon of the kennesite said unto him
[18:55] thou knowest the thing that the Lord
[18:57] said unto Moses the man of God
[18:58] concerning me and thee and kadish barnia
[19:00] 40 years old was I when Moses the
[19:03] servant of the Lord sent me from kiddis
[19:04] barnegata to spy out the land
[19:07] and I brought him word again as it was
[19:09] in my heart
[19:10] nevertheless my brother that went up
[19:11] with me made the heart of the people
[19:13] melt but I wholly followed the Lord my
[19:15] God and Moses swear on that day saying
[19:18] surely the land World thy feet have
[19:20] trodden shall be thine inheritance and
[19:22] thy children forever because thou has
[19:25] holy fall of the Lord my thy God
[19:28] and now behold the Lord have kept me
[19:30] alive as he said these 40 and five years
[19:33] even since the Lord spake this word unto
[19:35] Moses while the children of Israel
[19:37] wandered in the wilderness and now lo I
[19:39] am this day four score and five years
[19:41] old as yet I am as strong this day as I
[19:44] was in the day that Moses sent me as my
[19:47] strength was then even so was my
[19:49] strength now
[19:51] for war both to go out and to come in
[19:53] now therefore give me this mountain
[19:56] where the Lord speak in that day
[19:59] for thou hardest in that day how the
[20:01] anakims were there and that the cities
[20:03] were great and fenced if so be the Lord
[20:05] will be with me then I shall be able to
[20:08] drive them out
[20:09] as the Lord said and Joshua blessed him
[20:12] and gave unto Caleb the son of jafana
[20:14] Hebron for an inheritance so when Joshua
[20:18] gave Caleb that land that was his and
[20:21] just like when you read in the Bible the
[20:22] things that are yours if it says it's
[20:24] yours then you have access to it but you
[20:26] got to fight for it like Caleb did
[20:28] there's there's going to be times where
[20:30] you get on your knees and you struggle
[20:31] and you read through your Bible to be
[20:33] sure that that's what you have access to
[20:34] but if the Bible says it you can claim
[20:37] it
[20:37] you've got a right to it and why do you
[20:40] have a right to it that's what Paul was
[20:41] talking about here when Paul Jesus died
[20:43] so that you you could your inheritance
[20:46] could be expressed in you so that you
[20:48] could have access to it he died so that
[20:50] so when you read in the Bible the
[20:52] reading the Bible is the reading of the
[20:54] will the will is laid out for you
[20:56] hearing the pages of the Bible and when
[20:58] you open it up and it becomes real to
[21:00] you you've got access to it
[21:02] it's yours
[21:05] maybe as the preaching of the word Goes
[21:07] Forth today and as you leave the
[21:08] building maybe uh something was a
[21:11] special will ring in your heart to know
[21:12] that that these things that we're
[21:14] hearing about are not just vain promises
[21:16] but that Christ died for died for us to
[21:19] have access to them
[21:20] so if we go back to the scripture that
[21:22] we just read it says in verse 15 for
[21:25] this calls he is the mediator of the New
[21:26] Testament that by and remember my
[21:29] mediator is one that stands between but
[21:31] also the mediator is the one the one
[21:33] that's going to to to make a he he is
[21:37] the one that's going to see that the
[21:38] things that are spoken of are going to
[21:40] come to pass that's the mediator's job
[21:42] the mediator is going to say well he's
[21:44] not just a a between uh between the two
[21:48] the two opposing things uh he's not just
[21:51] going to resolve the conflict but he's
[21:53] going to stand there and make sure that
[21:54] that Testament is fulfilled
[21:56] that by means of death for the
[21:58] Redemption of the transgressions that
[21:59] were under the first testament they
[22:01] which are called might receive the
[22:03] promise of Eternal inheritance
[22:05] for where our testimony is there must
[22:08] also a necessity be the death of the
[22:10] testator for a testament is a force
[22:12] after men are dead
[22:14] otherwise it is of no strength at all
[22:16] while the testator liveth I see you that
[22:19] the pattern is repeated all through the
[22:21] scripture in the Old Testament the Old
[22:23] Testament was in effect after the death
[22:24] of the animal in the New Testament The
[22:27] Testament is in effect after the death
[22:29] of Christ in the Old Testament that's
[22:32] what Paul as he keeps going on he says
[22:34] whereupon neither the first testament
[22:35] was dedicated without blood
[22:37] but when Moses has spoken every precept
[22:39] to all the people according to the law
[22:41] he took the blood of calves and of goats
[22:43] for the water and Scarlet wool and
[22:45] hyssop and sprinkled both a book and all
[22:47] the people
[22:48] saying this is the blood of the
[22:50] testament which God hath enjoined unto
[22:52] you why did he sprinkle the book because
[22:54] that's your will
[22:56] and that will is going to come into
[22:58] effect
[22:59] in Exodus chapter 4 Moses took the blood
[23:02] and sprinkled it on the people and said
[23:03] behold the blood of the Covenant which
[23:05] the Lord hath made with you concerning
[23:07] all these works
[23:09] and Hebrews 9 if we keep reading only he
[23:11] says moreover he sprinkled both with
[23:13] blood both a tabernacle and all the
[23:15] vessels of the ministry and almost all
[23:18] things are by the law purged with blood
[23:20] and without shedding of blood is no
[23:23] remission now when you when when the
[23:26] blood is shed you've got you've got
[23:29] something that you can you can have
[23:30] confidence in
[23:32] blood is light it's the life of the in
[23:34] the Old Testament the life of the animal
[23:36] was shed the New Testament the life of
[23:38] God will shed and that life is going to
[23:41] come back in The Believer through the
[23:43] through the new birth but around said
[23:45] and inside he said the penalty is death
[23:47] and something has to die to pay that
[23:49] penalty so it can only be
[23:51] substitutionary or or all in death if
[23:54] there wasn't a substitute for us to hold
[23:55] on to and man in doing this realize that
[23:59] that he needs something to hold on to
[24:01] something that he can put his hands on
[24:03] something he can say this is it I've got
[24:07] it I know it's it
[24:10] so and identify with Christ but around
[24:12] said in the Old Testament when a man
[24:14] wants to be identified at the house of
[24:16] God he took the most innocent thing he
[24:18] could find a lamb and he know the lamb
[24:22] was free from sin because it knowed no
[24:24] sin and he went and took the lamb and
[24:26] put his hand upon his head and confessed
[24:29] his sin and by faith he transferred his
[24:31] sins on the lamb and the innocence of
[24:33] the Lamb back on him and then the lamb
[24:36] died because it was a sinner and the man
[24:39] lived by an Act of Faith of obeying what
[24:42] God's in now let's see when you put your
[24:43] hands on that on that lamb in the Old
[24:45] Testament
[24:46] it's all that blood running through it
[24:48] you could say running down off off of
[24:50] lamb you can say this is it
[24:53] my sins are gone but what did he do he
[24:55] went right back out of the temple with
[24:58] the same desire he had when he come in
[25:01] because when that blood set was broken
[25:03] which the Life Starts in one blood cell
[25:05] and when that blood cell was broken the
[25:07] life of the Lamb would not coincide or
[25:09] come back into the human life because it
[25:12] was an animal life The Man Without with
[25:15] the same desire he had so therefore he
[25:17] committed sins continually all the time
[25:19] again the musicians can go ahead and
[25:20] come forward but see now in the New
[25:22] Testament it's going to change the
[25:24] believer
[25:25] it's going to change you
[25:27] but there coming time when God made us
[25:29] an example and he gave us the Lord Jesus
[25:32] and when a sinner puts his hands upon
[25:35] his precious head and confesses his sins
[25:37] and his sins is transformed or
[25:39] transferred from The Sinner to Jesus and
[25:42] the innocence of Jesus is transferred by
[25:44] the Holy Ghost back into that person
[25:46] he's a new creature in Christ Jesus
[25:49] that's where I want to be identified the
[25:51] Bible said he knowing no sin was made
[25:53] sin for us the reason he suffered was
[25:56] for our sins and it's no more than what
[25:58] is right no more than our duties to look
[26:00] at these things and see that these
[26:02] desires that we have that God put in us
[26:05] to create in us to make us to want to be
[26:08] like him
[26:09] that's your inheritance that God would
[26:11] change your desire to be like him and to
[26:14] want to be like him to forsake the
[26:16] things of this world you've got access
[26:18] to these things that divine
