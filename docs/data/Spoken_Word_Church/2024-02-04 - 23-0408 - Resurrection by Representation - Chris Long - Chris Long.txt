ones grow up and I I see some faces not here anymore but to see The Young Ones taking up their swords and shields for the Lord got so much to say just take a couple minutes all right you know we went through this Co thing and I I wanted to say a couple things about Co for the world it may be one way but for us the co was nothing but a door to heaven for some of our precious brothers and sisters we did not lose anybody they went to the next place amen and we'll wait on them we didn't lose anybody everything that happens to the believer was predestinated for ordained planned of God and if that was God's choice to to have Isaiah the prophet son in half to have John the Baptist beheaded and to have Brother Ray Montgomery go by a a a crazy virus so be it that's God Amen and and we'll see them again amen and this message goes on just uh every now and then we have a little Eagle that comes with his family brother Ryan God bless you so good to have him amen my heart is different from two years ago when we saw each other and I just can't help but think about Abraham traveling and he's he's going through wildernesses and places he's never seen and he's thinking this world is not my home and he's just looking for a place you know and he know God is the maker of that promised place and he's searching and searching and he meets people and they're just such strangers with such strange ways and right oh my but you know God was God was good to him and he gave him the he gave him the answer to all his questions and this message has given us the answer to all of our questions amen we are we are coming to a place exactly where we're supposed to be at exactly the right moment and we're get to what I told my 14-year-old daughter I says honey you get to watch the world fall apart you get to watch as the world is falling apart the things that were said back in the prophet's Ministry are coming to pass right before us what an amazing thing yeah you know you get a chance to think while you're driving 3 hours a little bit more because of the rain and couple curves yeah one you all of a sudden I we got to a place we hadn't been there for a long time and it's called blood mountain and uh I thought how perfect I'm on blood Mountain I'm on the I'm on the road Through Blood Mountain and all those curves and those hardships and I thought this is the perfect place for me I want to be on blood Mountain amen I want to be on that road where the blood of Jesus Christ covers every step that I take amen I want to be on that road where the king of Calvary is Tred and I'm thinking going down and finally you know it's just 18 miles and I'm just driving and driving it says 17 like yep that's it and those curves were so so steep you almost turn back and go the other way think that's Blood Mountain I'm still going forward though I'm still pressing on I'm still still making it we're still making it this message is so worldwide I I think sometimes unfortunately as Americans we don't get to see the power that's happening all over the world right right but I can testify to you today in Chile in in Argentina in in Haiti in Cambodia of all places you walk and there's churches what a lovely thing and I can't wait to hear the word and I pray it's real good we come for church amen we come to to let the enemy know where we stand you're part of an invincible Army this is the day now where we're beginning to recognize who we are amen and there is no uh lack of water there is no drought in this Kingdom bye brother so I love everybody and thank you for staying with this message thank you for gathering together my heart just just feels so at home and it's been too long too long for us to be aart and and uh I just want to quit wandering one day one day we're going to run brother Samuel right we're going to run like children see who is finally faster yeah there you go amen we're going to sing we're going to hear our brother sing again amen and and then maybe David will come along David says I'll play the harp to that song and won't that be grand amen God bless you I'm looking forward to the word and let's just really pull from the ministry let's just have one of them great old Services because last thing to say we don't know how long this will last buddy oh I'm not worried I have social security to live by like that that can take it oh I'm better off yet I've got the stock market I've messed around with that a little bit and I I've I've used a yo-yo in my life and it goes up goes down and I'm so happy and I'm so sad that's right but the word of God will be true the word of God will go past all that and we are on the right track are we are going through Blood Mountain amen we're going to come out on the other side of them clouds

and teaches Sunday school he been doing that for a little while but when he first came along he was just a little kid you know remember we used to come to he he'd ride with us in in the van and and

amen I like that cuz I'm looking at him right now amen in the form of the mystical body of Jesus Christ pleasure to be here with you tonight God bless you all what appropriate words that brother Tom spoke you didn't realize that the title of my message is resurrection by representation amen but unfortunately we're going to have to hit a little dark side before we get to the light I think that's why the weather is so bad outside because this uh represents the day when he was in tuned back many thousand years ago and uh really enjoyed brother Dutch's message I tell you what that fed my soul uh that was Eagle food enjoyed it enjoyed it enjoyed it he he just text me a minute ago said he was still driving I told him I went down to the rental car agency and traded in my car for a boat we may get snow but at least we can walk on it right amen sure love everybody here it's a pleasure to be here with you I don't need to take up a lot of time introducing myself how about if we just get right into the word and and I'll try to keep her under three hours and that you'll be plenty hungry plenty hungry my wife's already saying uhuh all right let's go to Romans 8:11 I'm going to yeah cut the lights right uh Romans 8:11 Resurrection by representation now I got to give you the dark side first but I'm reading this scripture because it's the end result of the rising of the sun amen I got a pair of glasses in here somewhere no I don't need a pair thank you he loan me a pair last time and they were some girls glasses and I I just don't go there have you got your Bibles open I tell you Brothers back there in the back I found an app that makes the sound of pages turning there is one there sure is I like to hear the pages of your Bible turning but there is an app that makes that sound so you guys might want to hook it up all right Romans 8 verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken amen your bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you all right let's bow our heads father we thank you this evening Lord this afternoon father for the grand privilege of being able to gather together Lord with those of like Faith father under the shed blood and banner of Jesus Christ Lord we realize that the weather outside father is compensation Lord for what happened Lord 2,000 years ago or so father we realized Lord that while it was dark and gloomy outside Lord you were still working as we desire to work for you today Lord bless each and everyone that's made the effort to come Lord thank you for traveling mercies father and the specials Lord and the and the tender words from Brother Tom Lord help me father I pray to get out of the way Lord use me for your honor and your glory Lord and let he that hath an ear hear what the spirit saith unto the churches Lord for your honor and For Your Glory in the precious and lovely name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you you may be seated God is good all the time not just some of the time all the time I like what brother Wade said the sun is still shining up there it yes it is amen now it says here in Ephesians uh chapter 1 verse4 according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love amen now we realize that this is the real the the real and only genuine holiday holy day which we can put our actual pulse upon celebrate sometimes Christmas some people do but we know that Christ wasn't born on December the 25th probably born sometime in April maybe late March early may like Lambs are born depending on the weather conditions but this weekend is the one time that we know as Christians that's set aside properly and of course it started uh I guess a week or so ago from tomorrow what it's a Palm Sunday when he came into town we heard brother Dutch cover that marvelously I tell you what I got I I got some good notes do you mind if I if I if I just go over a couple of things and and again I I enjoyed every word of it amen he was preaching to me if he wasn't preaching to you yeah right and I like when he started out when soon as he said the word Einstein now I'm not genius I'm not a mathematical guy like that I'm not a scientist but when the prophet of God says something about somebody it always intrigues me and I like to kind of look into that area uh brother brandom even went so far as to say that he went to hear a talk on Einstein that was given by a fellow that was famous back then I know his name but it doesn't come to me it doesn't matter uh but you know he said that Einstein was looking for the center was looking for the center of the universe and and he was trying to find it by mathematics right and uh of course he was a pretty good mathematical guy and I and I know that I wrote this down if I got it right uh uh brother uh Dutch mentioned that um how how that Einstein and and and and mathematicians and scientists afterwards and so forth um believed believe today that you can travel forward in time okay uh and they and they and they formulate that by uh their mathematical formulas and he mentioned how that Einstein had had uh made a proof of something and then couldn't find that last little phrase that he needed in that long five or six chalk boards worth of of algebraic equations and he and he used the word he fudged he fudged it you know he he he he thought well if I put this number in here nobody will know I think that That's what Satan thought by trying to inject the seed into Adam's race I'll put this in here and nobody will recognize it well right away of course somebody that has life and not death somebody eating off the tree of life and not the knowledge of the tree of Good and Evil would immediately recognize wait a minute you fudged it there that's right cuz we we don't go for that no we want all the word we don't want just part of the word we don't want 99% n999 of the word we want all the word now did you realize brothers and sisters that that has been the desire of all of the past Christians Believers men of God and so forth all the way back to the beginning but God ordained a time in history where only one portion of his body would be able to come to that fullness of his word and we live in that time it amazes me how that I you or I can read a scripture uh uh hear a message uh hear a a a sermon preached from a minister and and and you you could have heard that same sermon five minutes 5 days 5 years 50 years ago but spiritual food new season is always in action it's a NeverEnding occurrence so when he said that they proven that that they they they believe now now now I don't know that any one of these scientists have ever went forward in time but they believe mathematically it can be accomplished is that right right now he also said that these same scientists uh do not believe that you can go back in time all right or erase your past we got news for them yeah we do but I'm going to tell you folks something that science at the end of its uh equations and and calculations and and and postulations and theories proves God so I'm going to help them right now I'm going to agree with them brother Wade I don't have to go back in time but wait a minute I'm going to preach to you Resurrection by representation oh brother random told us that the woman at the well as an example uh she had representation now she didn't know that but she had it anyway and he said the Sadducees and the Pharisees and the high priest and the priesthood and and the Sanhedrin and all them they didn't have that representation So based upon that they attacked absolutely the word of God Amen in the flesh they didn't attack the word of God in the Scrolls they believe that they had the revelation of what was in those Scrolls but they didn't realize that the word had been made flesh and that is why they crucified him right we don't crucify you for being a good man now but we crucify you for you being a man and making yourself God you know what it would have been fantastic if Jesus knew knew that they had representation and he would have said but doesn't it say in Genesis let us make man in our image and after our likeness but they couldn't have swallowed that so he didn't cast his pearls he said I got to turn aside yeah there there's somebody waiting for me at a well that's right and I happen to know that I am her representation and I'm going to resurrect a life that's been laying in her since before the foundation of the world now I'm preaching to you on Resurrection we can go back and we can go through the history uh was it uh was it brother Dutch that mentioned and your and and and and brother Samuel has I been an eyewitness that for instance over in the Philippines this weekend there it's probably tomorrow morning over there now they are really literally nailing themselves to crosses they've carried them and and so forth and all those things uh and and and but but but they're not going to resurrect from the dead unless they were in him yeah before the foundation amen of the world so my thoughts that I wrote down well brother Dutch was speaking was that we don't have to go backwards God always moves forward what the prophet of God taught us that eternal life is like a circle so if you just keep going far enough you'll go past your past and you'll come right back up to where you came from we don't have to go back we need to go forward is that right I just got INSP fired when he said that I said oh I see something here you see because what we think of discernment by the prophet is him looking back because we're creatures of time what we don't realize is that the god that we serve never goes backwards those four living creatures always go forward I'm going to get brother Wade a hat oh with four bills on it Postman beekeeper mayor he only wants three bills right now I'll stop right there there's a fourth one waiting there's a fourth one waiting I know you do cuz I'm on your side God is good amen right brother but look where we're at today man I enjoyed that I'll tell you what missed a good one if you missed it I mean you know we understand that people have to do things and it looked like uh he was preaching on Good Friday but it looked like a bad Friday yeah really did um but it was a good Friday the weather outside right now looks terrible but there will be a sunrise I believe tomorrow we'll see it sir but I want to put some emphasis on a few things if I can I'm not going to keep you a long time I hear your stomach's growling now I remember uh in one of the messages and it'll come to me brother brandom is that a Full Gospel business broken systs at a Full Gospel businessman's breakfast and he keeps telling the people at the end of the message forget about the cafeteria now he does says he go B and listen and he picks it up two or three or four times don't worry about it it'll still be there when you that's right cuz he was bearing down on something yeah but let me read let me start out by reading something to you out of a message if I could uh the brothers I'll tell you what they are you know I'm just a rookie with these tablet things you all know that uh and uh perhaps someday I'll actually get used to them the God who is rich in Mercy 19- 65 let's just you want to go for a ride amen right now it's a boat but let's go for a ride okay brother brandom says starting in paragraph 30 and I was speaking last Sunday on the Ephesians how that the Book of Joshua was the Ephesians of the Old Testament and how was a book of redemption you see that's what Easter's all about and Redemption has two different parts don't forget that now come out of and entering into first you have to come out some people wants to bring the world in with them but you got to come out of the world to enter into Christ did you get that okay now we were in him we got to come out of the world to get back in him even though we never were out of him okay but you and I came through a perversion but there's a purpose behind it God has a plan you have to come out of unbelief to enter into Faith now you see how he shifted that amen right he took us now to a spiritual walk yeah everybody is is celebrating the natural crucifixion 2,000 years ago or so and it happened and it has meaning but we realize that in the day we live in there has been a second crucifixion there's been an indictment and it's harsh like the weather today you listen to that message and you find out listen brothers and sisters that the ministry of today is guilty of crucifying the Son of God fresh amen that's why the weather's not good but what they didn't realize is that God brother bradam said this and I may be getting ahead of myself that's okay I'll just hurry up all right he said that the denominational thought process bound the holy spirit for nearly 2,000 years now that's an inment amen that's right you know what they do whenever somebody dies back in the old days they wrap them all up they bind them but brother brandham said never said that the Holy Spirit died because it cannot die but denominationalism bound that Holy Spirit by trying to tie it up and put ownership on it from a human perspective but here's what they forgot to think about while they were busy binding the Holy Spirit to to keep it from excessing the people Jesus was not in the Tomb on Saturday come on now they didn't know that because there was a big Stone in the way they thought he was still bound inside that tomb but he was busy preaching the gospel to the souls that were in prison now brother Bram in the message souls in prison which is about in tment in a way okay declared to us that it looked like that Souls that are in prison and Jesus preaching to them was like the third poll today preaching to the totally lost amen but that is not all he said he said while the third pull is the word being preached to the totally lost it's for the bride you understand that he didn't say it in that message but he said it in a message after that it's for the bride and that's the difference between you and I and all the other churches on on the planet now I'm not talking about the local assembly here I'm talking about you being the church we just had some meetings last weekend for our 11th anniversary and brother Emanuel Salazar gets up there and says how in the world could you stay out of church when you are the church amen if you are the church you're staying in the church we're not talking about the four walls now we're talking about you as an individual House of God now we realize that inment requires a tomb yes it what is a tomb it's a place the dictionary says of confinement see what that Spirit tried to do it tries to confine it's still here today it tries to confine the moving and freedom of the word of God made flesh remember they didn't crucify him for being a good man right they didn't even crucify him for being a rotten man because there was a rotten man on death row and they let him go is that right okay go ahead okay better settle down good no go a place of confinement listen to what it says a building house chamber vault structure Etc in which a corpse is intered now brother brandham told us about them cemeteries doesn't require a theologian I am far from an Einstein in the message but I realize that if we'll take what all those great men were looking for through their intellect and education and AC Academia and we begin to separate the Bible says You must rightly divide the word Hebrews 4:12 says the word of God is sharper and more powerful it's a discerner you must have discernment I know groups of Ministries today that claim to follow this message that don't believe you can have discernment only the prophet they say that is not scripture that is not message I'll tell you what that is that's a tomb that's a Whited Seiler full of Dead Man's Bones that's what the Bible says all right still with me so so what we have here is we have a religious spirit that's trying to keep you captive by keeping him captive but we have proof now what day of the week is Friday right it's the sixth day of the week that's why he was crucified on Friday because of the number six it's a judgment number is that right now today is Saturday is that right and today is the seventh day of the week and God always runs in mathematics that's why I was really enjoying brother Dutch he brother brandham told us he runs in MA mathematics is not from Einstein mathematics is from God Amen it's just that man tries to put his two cents worth in and he ends up fudging everything that's right amen amen he has to amen that's what they're busy doing today and in their Laboratories remember when brother Brandon mentioned the the men in the Laboratories pouring the test tubes back and forth and and and somebody said stop that don't do that and they just looked up and like zombies and kept pouring their little test tubes back for look where we're at today the brother mentioned uh uh uh Co don't tell me that's not some test tubes being poured together and and they think they're helping Humanity what really are they thinking do you think that they think they're trying to kill people and as I've heard population control and ethnic control and race control and and intelligence control and control control control no what they're trying to do and they don't even realize that they're being used by the devil Amen to try to create an [Music] Eden amen but it's Satan's Eden already that's right amen and Satan is the only Pastor he's the only Minister he's the only Shepherd he's the only God I know that's occupied by killing his congregation hall right what's the matter with the guy you with me this is Satan Eden and there's only one group of people that God ordained to be able to with and the fiery darts of the enemy and everything he has to throw at us and he accomplished it by revealing to you and I what he did on Calvary every bit of it is in here right amen I can't hardly preach on Easter without bringing up job yeah come on now but we'll do that tomorrow yeah okay all right all right I just got done preaching a series on job don't not realizing Easter was coming I didn't have him on the ashy for 3 months or 6 weeks or one year I probably preached on it for three months but oh there's so much in there but at the end of the day job caught something that apparently nobody else caught and he caught it in such a time where it was critical critical mass I know My Redeemer liveth we'll get there tomorrow listen now let's let's get done with Redemption shall we there there cannot be watch what he says you have to come out of unbelief to enter into Faith there cannot be one thing in your way not one right come on now can't be a grave can't be a tomb can't be a church can't be your intellect there cannot be one thing in your way to really have genuine Faith you must absolutely leave everything that's contrary to the word of God behind see behind we're not going backwards to enter into Faith amen and that was the book of Ephesians of the Old Testament Joshua where listen to what he says where Moses represented the law could not save no one but Grace could and here Joshua is the same word like like Jesus Jehovah Savior and now then we find out that we have come to another Ephesians now brothers and sisters if you haven't caught it and you you will because I'm going to tell you point blank there's been a second crucifixion of Jesus Christ am in our generation amen therefore there has to be another Resurrection amen and brother brandom to me represented Jesus when everybody thought he was in the Tomb laying dead he was busy working he was preaching and God was using him to manifest not the resurrected Christ the way in you and I think he didn't die twice he only needed the Bible said to sacrifice one time but because of denomination nationalism and religion yes and science forgive me I'm not preaching against scientists but I am preaching against the philosophy that's right of science We Don't Preach against higher education did yall know that brother brandham never preached against oh wait a minute brother I got 10 quotes but what you don't realize is he was preaching against the spirit that was entering into the system to begin to manipulate and massage and change the Outlook of the young mind starting at a very young age and I'll tell you when it started when did this nation turn its back on God as a nation 1956 and if you go back in your history you'll find out that there was a turn made in 1956 and it started in the school systems with the little bitty prek but it was such an infant so if there's a teacher in here please don't I'm not preaching against you that's right I feel something know I'm not preaching against you I'm wanting you to understand that politics and religion are now two horns on one head brother brandom said that that that that that that that little that little creature there that represented the United States he said it started out like a lamb but it turned into a bison and I'll tell you what I know a few Cowboys and you don't Cowboy a bison don't he cowboy is you if he feels like running he runs if he feels like taking down the fence you can't stop him if he wants to eat over there in that pasture and he doesn't like it where you've got him he just goes don't get in his way cuz he'll mow you right down now do you see what's happening in politics don't get in their way I'm not preaching to you politics but I want you to understand that same Spirit has crept into the church and now now it's coming around the message churches which which you know why you know why it's just now getting here because they realize listen now Satan's not a Creator that's the one thing he can't do what what's the other thing he can't bring the word word by word so I was telling brother Wade then if brother brandham and he did make both statements to me bringing the word word by word is creation there are two in that one God it's creating something in you which will raise you up in the day we live in and you'll go from the Barnyard to the Eagle's Nest you say well brother uh I I'm not I'm not I'm not in the barnyard you were at one time I can prove it I can prove by the words of the prophet that you well you don't understand now brother I didn't come through the church watch watch on now now brother brandom typed the Barnard as a denominational work is that not right but you forgot the pig sty I come from the pig sty amen that's right brother I come and guess what the pig has to do when the call of God begins to call on him the Deep calling to the Deep he he's he stops winking y well he still looks like a pig Y what in the world was that how does a pig hear an eagle cry remember that same Pig has to come through the Barnyard you see that's why I see what happens in the message churches today not this when you understand I'm attacking Spirits absolutely because a lot of folks come through the church so they were already in the Barnard they just didn't know whether they were a chicken or an eagle now the pig he gets a double power of transformation remember the brother that brother Bram talked to and he said now brother brandom I don't want to die cuz I want to make the Rapture he said you get a double blessing brother that's right he says you get resurrected and then you go in the Rapture now the pig that was in the world he gets resurrected and then he walks through the Barnyard and hears the eagle crying going who what's that what is that he was an eagle all the time he just had a pig nature yeah that's right that Nature's got to change amen now now when you get to the Barnard that nature changes and you think you're a chicken yeah but you're really an eagle you just don't know the difference has you have you ever noticed when when birds are hats they're really ugly and and and and they got no feathers in their heads they're all bald and they just flop around you know and their head got s you know and they can barely squeak yeah exactly but what happens is the food chain begins to change amen metamorphosis in a way they're all just little bitty scraggly birds that can barely move and they don't know one from another but somehow over time because brother bam said the eagle just can't eat them bucks now when he said that brother wait I'm going to tell you what came to me now brother BR didn't say this so I want to make that clear but what came to me was there's a chick missing every once in a while oh the Lord where'd it go you know the mother chicken she don't yeah one two three four it's not a cartoon yeah five six she just says I'll lay more eggs I'll have more chicks I'll lay more eggs and I'll have more chicks I'll multiply I'll multiply I'll multiply I'll bring forth after him but after a while this one bird gets twice as big as the other ones now he doesn't know he's an eagle he just looking down at the rest of the congregation going what in the world and because he's an eagle I'm telling you every once in a while a chick has to come up miss him yeah come on now I mean it's just an natural occurrence the chick has to come up missing you know and that's and you know that's like a church member right that you know if you was raised in the barnyard of a church and people go I don't want to be here no more yeah yeah yeah come on hopefully the eagle didn't get you think about it right there was very few mice around in that Barnard you know snakes didn't come no strange Barnyard and then after a while that eagle began to get twice as big as the mother now the mother's a chicken oh doesn't know any better it thinks hey look at Junior there he's going to be in the NFL huh look at him run he out strides them all he hears that eagle cry amen what was that see he was predestinated right he was going to resurrect by representation amen how is he going to resurrect he's already alive so are we God's not dead he's still alive but what the devil is trying to convince us of is that he's not here and he is yeah that's right and if he gets here he's bound when he gets here that's what you and I do with him that's what brother brandom indicted the ministry for is keeping him bound so that when he gets free in the congregation that's right that people can't use it and harness it right for the purpose it was intended that's right God is good so I'll just stay with the eagle story it's it's right here in my notes but and I could read to you all the things that brother but he said some tremendous things about The Eagle right our brother was preaching last weekend and he quoted a quote brother Wade at our meetings you're going to pick up your pen and write right now he mentioned a quote brother brandham said and I started to write down and I said well there's bald eagles I'm becoming one there's golden eagles there's Harpy eagles there's sea eagles anybody been at the ocean and Beach s see there's SE Eagles you know and you can go down the list and I think there's 17 19 15 20 different kinds of eagles and then subspecies let me tell you something about an eagle I've been fishing in hannes Alaska yeah and you catch a nice salmon and that eagle wants it yep you ain't getting it right I don't care if it's on your hook yeah he takes it from you so I began to think and this brother was quoting and he quoted a quote where brother brandham said true Eagles and I said look at that there's another Eagle possibility brother it ain't bald it ain't golden it ain't Harpy it ain't sea it doesn't eat roadkill did you all know that there are eagles that eat roadkill absolutely not every Eagle will no but there are certain families of eagles that will just take any old scrap y right they'll take it away come on brother they'll keep guard over it from the vultures but I found out last weekend there's an eagle that can't miss it's a true Eagle amen a true Eagle can't miss because that's what brother brandham said and that's what you are yes and you may not realize it but when we were in that denominational thought process which still happens today to people even sitting in message churches why I know people that become uh uh isolationists in their own church ah well who's preaching today well I don't feel like coming because I but there might be a little piece of meat in there that you got to have you don't know that's right getting quiet in here good you need it I need it right amen regardless of who you say well well that brother's off go anyway yeah let me tell you why because brother Brenham said after that eagle began to get a little bigger and it began to develop feathers and it it still didn't know it was an eagle now and it heard that cry still didn't know it was Engle but it wo what was that that has a deep call and a deep respond oh my goodness and he started looking around now he wasn't impune and degrading the chickens he was only thinking about one thing he was thinking about where did that come from and the next time that eagle cried and said come on up by representation amen that's what the woman at the well had she didn't realize it but she was an eagle in the Barnard of humanity now watch this want to know why I tell you to leave the chickens alone you don't have to touch them you don't have to say nothing to them you just flap those wings when Mama says come up a little higher and brother brandom says where do you get the fence post but let me tell you something I grew up around farms and ranches and if an eagle or a hawk or any bird of prey gets on a fence post and he's flapping his wings the chickens are running for cover right cuz they see the shadow of a bird of prey and that's an instinct go yeah right then you find yourself all by yourself on the fence post I got to find a church see what happened to me in the world is I wasn't happy on the inside and I wanted to find a peace and I didn't know God I didn't know Jesus Christ but I wanted to find peace and contentment and reality and and and and all the things that we desire yes he knew what he was doing brother Wade I didn't realize that was when I was up on the fence post I hadn't gone to church yet I was up on the fence post and all my ryy friends absolutely disappeared didn't want to be around me no more why because I'd be preaching to them I remember the first week I got saved I found out about the cloud and the Life Magazine I went down to the local Auction Yard and got three or four magazines for 25 cents a piece back then wow it was a long time ago I've been doing this 45 years then I'm witnessing to one of my best friends in his bedroom we were Motocross Racing buddies I'm sitting on the foot of his bed brother Wade there's a bookshelf across from me and I'm preaching to them I'm telling them a God sent a prophet and that there was a cloud and that you know I was immature but I was an eagle I just I was just going off thinking everybody was going to hear it I didn't know and I'm just going at it with him and he's like wow yeah wow yeah wow but brother Wade right there as I was testifying to him about God sending a cloud in 1963 L and behold God is my witness right on his bookshelf was a britanica encyclopedia 64 yearbook which in it has the picture of the cloud for 1963 I whooped that thing off there and I opened it up and I said there it is right there and he was like you must have known that was there he said I said said I had no idea I'd heard that it was in one of the encyclopedias a yearbook he had it on his shelf the next week he moved yeah huh he moved he moved out to San Louis abiso from the from the mainland or the center of California where I lived but I didn't know I thought wow man I thought everybody would accept this because I thought everybody I guess was an eagle I didn't realize that I was walking with the chickens right and the pigs and the pigs di right you see how God operates brothers and sisters what you don't realize is that if you were in him you're still there yes he don't lose one all that the father has given me will come to me and I won't lose one the devil can't snatch one from me that's what the resurrection means to me I wasn't there 2,000 years ago but he's here today the resurrected Christ is now living in us I caught something last week as the brother was preaching and we got a picture of the pillar of fire up there and he gets the picture off the wall and he begins to show and he's talking about how that how that this Pillar of Fire speaks what speaks spoke to Moses then he began to preach on how this same Pillar of Fire on the day of Pentecost broke off from itself but it never diminished like the fishes in the loaves it was still the same size and the same Pillar of Fire why they had leftovers with the fishes and the loaves can I take my coat off I'm going to preach a little bit look at that thank you and it come to me it should come to you that Pillar of Fire was in that burning bush that Pillar of Fire was in the photograph I believe that Pillar of Fire was in the hearts of every believer starting from the day of Pentecost so guess what brother that makes us a burning bush amen amen there's an attraction on the mountain they just don't know what it is but if they turn aside and they Wonder hey what happened to you brother I haven't seen you in years well you got time sit down that's right let me tell you how this works there is a pillar of fire burning in my heart named Jesus Christ Jesus Christ he was a man 2,000 years ago oh but when Paul met him oh yeah that's right Paul met him yeah and he went back to God is that right he said he came from God and he went back to God and the prophet of God says you and I have the same life in us so not if we came from God but because we came from God we're going back to God but we've always been a part of God you say well brother I can read to you quotes where brother brandham says there ain't nothing good in us I got those same quotes I want to ask you a question who are you brother bradam said you don't see me this ain't me right there's a man in here who can turn on the light there's a man in here who turns water to wine walks on the water and gives sight to the blind he gave back life to the ones that's daddy fed 4,000 with seven loaves of bread y right do you believe that yeah that's the resurrected Christ today brothers and sisters he didn't die on Calvary so people could nail themselves to the Cross every Easter no died on Calvary so that the life that he lived could come back and be imparted into each and every one of you and I and what would it do to us it would transform us there's a question and question I'm off my notes now there's a question and questions and answers that somebody asked brother Bram if they'll explain the translation yeah that's right brother Bram does not mention Enoch no he says let me tell you about Abraham and he begins to talk about Abraham and his journey and that Journey Abraham took what you and I are on tonight began to turn Abraham from an old man who was dried up into a young man who could produce children now the church was a little behind him yeah that's right now watch we don't know whether the church Sarah had gotten the Revelation at the same time that uh that that the transformation at the same time that Abraham did because she wouldn't participate that's right she said I got a Hagar here yeah I got an idea see see what's wrong see what happens with the church I got this idea lay them ideas down would you right right throw them in the garbage can take God and God alone and once you get him brothers and sisters you'll find out he's not inomed amen that's not a gloomy day outside that's right am that's the same spirit that falls the just and the unjust and we live by it you say well there's too much rain I'll tell you there's too much snow you don't have to shovel rain you come to my house and you'll be shoveling snow right you don't believe me listen to what the prophet says I got it I got it here I'm just going to stay off my notes and stop pretty quick thank you but you know what it's getting hot in here I can tell listen to this I got trials tribulations and tests written down here brother it says from the message I know amen I'm going to finish that my redeemer liveth but it's I know yeah the date there 419 of 60 this is what the prophet of God said think about it we ask for comfort and peace there I was asking for still asking for comfort and peace but my peace and comfort now come from within right because there's a resurrected Christ inside of us that means that we are able to do and perform all of those signs wonders and miracles that he did he said if you believe me these signs shall follow follow you people are so oh get out of the Barnyard brother get up on the post that's not your final destination the the Fitz post is just as high as you can get and the chickens are running amen you haven't even flown yet amen you did what a turkey does when he wants to roost but mama says come on up amen you're an eagle amen and she keeps calling that word keeps talking to you that that Revelation keeps coming it's spiritual food and du season it keeps feeding it keeps building faith muscles it keeps building spiritual amen bodies we ask for comfort and peace God gives us the best he can give us what is it the next sin says trials and tribulation oh right away people I don't want to serve that God yeah oh and your life is any better yeah see what happens is if we recognize that he gives us his best through trials and tribulations we become real genuine God born God felt God builded God begotten right children of God that's our goal not everybody wants to do that most people want to hang around here for a while and save some more money and convert their cash into gold and okay it's not going to help you you want to know why you can accumulate in a mass as much riches as you want you can have a food shelter you can have gold piled up in your safe and guess who's showing up if the IRS don't come y if the FBI don't come if the doj don't come if Hunter Don't Come Easy your neighbor's coming yeah yeah you know the guy that's got the cash of AK-47s and 10 million rounds of ammo and he's oh there's guys like that in Flagstaff they asked me how come I don't carry a gun in church I said I don't need a gun in church according to what the prophet said bullets will bounce right off you and if they don't brother Tom they you'll go home is that right that's what you that's what he was testifying that's right God don't lose a one who in the world wants to stick around here do you think it's going to get better come on it it's get snowballing yeah it's an avalanche of sin and unbelief and craziness right amen but do you want peace and contentment and comfort trial and tribulation is coming your way but God Made You to with understand every one of them by his life being placed in you and to finish about representation now brother Bram explain to us the translation of the Bride okay I will let me use Abraham as an example he talks about Abraham and the journey you're on it amen and that journey is transforming You by hearing the word of God and it alone amen and brother brandham says that word that you're taking in begins to start to form a body and that body begins to form on the inside of you right and if you keep taking in the word if you keep bringing in the eagle food you will see the resurrected Christ in your very own life then you won't care what comes or goes you won't care what the government's doing or the banks are failing or even if your car is broke down brother or car in your case amen because he's given you his best he's forming a character yes he is by the building of that body inside of you and brother brandham says this in closing did you know the resurrection lays in you now we know that what the scripture means they without us I'm telling you those folks that have gone on before us you may not realize it but they're rooting they're pulling they're shouting now there is a half hour of Silence in everybody's life right absolutely because you begin to look at yourself and brother brandham said that's seven seal they were a by it I mean like wow it's pretty awesome Amen when you come to the real genuine revelation that God the Eternal God the god that H don't try to figure this out you'll become Einstein what I didn't tell you about Einstein if you ever watch any of documentaries on him he spent the last years of his life laying in bed with chalkboards in front of him trying to figure out how to change that equation into a final answer he didn't realize all the time that the James web super telescope was going to go out and look for it right cuz he mentioned Hubble so they got the idea that telescope is 1 million miles out there and it's got these big wings that fold out and they're reflective mirrors and they're and they're sending and wanting to receive signals guess what the mirrors are made out of does anybody know it's gold thank you and the way they explained it when I was hearing the documentary on it I know this sounds crazy but the guy took his wedding band off and he laid it on the table and he said there's about five six or seven of those wedding bands in those giant mirrors that are yards and yards and yards wide yeah it's funny that he used a wedding band uh and that it's gold gold is the most conductive and reflective substance that we know of but it has to be beaten out amen so thin yes that you can see through it and it reflects like a mirror amen guess what looking for they're looking for the same thing that Einstein and Hubble and all the rest of the astronomers and Galileo and everybody was looking for they were looking for the god that's in you we could have saved them trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars and and and tens of 20s of years and said he's here quit wasting your time and your money amen but you know what I heard brother Dutch say this that the astronomer astrologers mathematicians scientists philosophers etc etc won't admit it's Jesus Christ that's right they won't admit it y they believe in a higher being they just don't want anybody to know that because then they don't need to teach anybody anything anymore amen is that right right it's exactly right you love him there a bodybuilding inside of you guess what it started with the same Pillar of Fire that built a body 2,000 years ago to walk this Earth 33 and a half years and hang on the cross for you and me so that we could become joint hirs with it please stand please stand please stand praise the Lord I know you don't want

forgetfulness that's good enough for me praise God my sins are gone heyen do you believe that though do you believe that you know he threw him in the sea of his own forgetfulness backwards where we can't go he threw them in the sea put a no fishing sign up and said don't go there no more but what do we do brother Tom we take a fishing pole we throw it out there and we bring them back out or we try to give him another hand that was good brother brother Chris can pour his heart out quicker than anybody I it took me two and a half hours to say what he said I know you can you can do it tomorrow but we appreciate the Lord in the Ministries that we hear the ministers uh the different ways of of of you know there's different ways to get to it Atlanta you know and you got five folds of it there's a map that you that's folded up brother Tom that fold is five fold if you unfold onefold you might get 20 mil down the road on now you unfold it again you might get 20 more miles down the road but you'll never get to your destination until you five take all five folds and open them up and let the fivefold ministry help us that's why we believe in a five-fold Ministry we don't believe in a onefold we believe in a five-fold Ministry that will pour their heart out out yes and the only way you're going to get it and I'm going to get it is that way we can press play all we want to but I promise you you will not get perfected the Bible says without a five-fold Ministry amen right can't do it it's according to the Bible to be perfected you got to listen to a man and you know what brother Brown he said that's hardest thing for one man to do is believe another man well you know what I don't believe brother Chris I believe that God is in him that just spoke to us through that human V now that way I do believe brother Chris amen now we're going to go eat a bite of natural food now we appreciate all of you coming we thank brother Chris again for pouring his heart out there's so many nuggets and I want to tell you if you weren't here last night you almost missed the Rapture that's why I'm telling you y'all miss church and you think by it ain't nothing just another you missed a visitation of God last night from God not from some man You' missed a visitation brother Dutch Scott preached a masterpiece so I'll adure you if you have not heard that or watched it that's why we put it online so you can watch it you need to watch that I'm going to go back and watch it myself again cuz I'm telling you it was full of nuggets he almost two hours that man preached it didn't seem like 15 minutes when somebody's saying something you slide off into eternity right and you listen to the eternal word of God and it just keeps going on and keeps going on and keeps going on we sure appreciate the fivefold ministry we appreciate everyone brother Tom and all the different ones too the ministry we have here we sure do appreciate we we we need to bind together right amen you realize today is what the seventh day right today the seventh day today Saturday that's right and you know what Jesus is not on the earth come on 2,000 years ago he's silent the Bible says silence in heaven not on Earth for the space of a half an hour he wasn't up there he was down preaching to the souls in prison yes sir but you know what he was doing he was doing what we've been preaching every sermon millions of sermons for 2,000 years that's what he was doing during that time of Silence there was nothing going on and then up from the grave he arose amen and he didn't rise for himself he rose for me and you I want you to understand that he did not come up for himself he didn't come up to get Glory of his own self he came up to get glory to give it to you he walked out of that tomb as brother Dutch said he walked out of that tomb and those feet that had nail prints on them he said I don't think he was down there in Hell tiptoeing he went H he wanted the devil to know he was the mighty conqueror right even with nail prints in his feet and His Hands he was a mighty conqueror looked like a bad day like today like like brother dut was talking about the sermon was Good Friday it didn't look very good if you look from the outside it didn't look very good very dark moon lost its light all the Stars lost their light there was no light it was the darkest day that ever was to a to man but not to a Christian that's right we know that had to be the part of the play and the plan that we've been talking about the Plan of Redemption there was a plan God had and that was per that was part of that plan and today we have seen part of that plan being given to each one of us and we appreciate uh brother Chris again and sister Joanna for coming and we love him with the love of the lord we love all of you with the love the Lord we wish you'd stay around and eat um it's just going to rain on you if you go outside so I appreciate brother Tom and his family coming and then we want to try to get to maybe get a fellowship meeting back into the summertime sometime brother Tony and different ones that they would they' try to we try to get it back together but I miss the fellowship meetings I really do I miss the fellowship meetings cuz it's a fellowship we come to fellowship with each other and and and do as brother Tom said he come up here and he gave us a little snippet of what was going on in his mind cuz usually a minister when he comes up here I hope he speaks his mind right he gave us a little snippet of what we been going on and you think well that was just 5 minutes to me it's an eternity of what's going on and what's happening and what's going on in the world and the different things each one of us we bring it all together and it's a big story it's a big picture and it's not a story that's a story like a a fiction it it's non-fiction what we what we speak is non-fiction amen and with Einstein you know Einstein came on the earth the greatest mind that ever was produced by human you understand what I'm saying the greatest mind that was ever produced by a man and a woman two human beings but thank God you and I we might have missed that we can't sit down and listen to Einstein break down the theory of relativity but we had a spiritual Einstein that came from a mother and father called brandham but he caught the mind of God and He was a spiritual Einstein I believe if You' have got that natural Einstein and and brother brandom together they might have been something went on they would have been a happening cuz they would have sat there and fed off of each other but thank God they didn't cuz he gave it to us but I like what we were talking about this uh yesterday brother Chris was talking about going forward you know you take and if you look at what Einstein his teaching was that if you could look through Infinity if you could look you know obviously it's in a curve all right but what did he say he said if man could look with infinite eyesight what would you see he said you see the back of your head there's your there's your new body he just didn't know what to call it Einstein just said you see the back of your head no we see the new body cuz that's our Eternal that we step into it's just a curve and we jump in it and take off all right visitors go first um we'll pray over the food here uh for those of you that go to church here next Sunday uh brother Dale's 83rd birthday will be next Sunday and we're going to have a birthday party afterwards uh after the second service and we appreciate everybody that come we appreciate um um the visitors that are here most of you have already been here before but we sure appreciate you coming and being a part of the fellowship uh tomorrow it's not ending tomorrow we will have church here 9:45 and we'll have brother brother Chris just hang on it gets good her if I know Chris long this is just a piece of it tomorrow will be a good one amen I just believe that I just believe that we're as brother Chris we were talking I believe you know it says a a true Eagle I believe we're in the true part we're not just an eagle we're true Eagles and and that doesn't make us bigheaded and separate ourselves let God separate us yes right God's the one that does it anyway God will separate us from the world I'll promise you that we not be chickens unless you are a chicken you're not going to be one you're going to be separated from that barnyard and we uh we know that there's one thing for sure we're heading closer to getting out of here one day further one day closer yes one day further on this journey is one day closer to the where we can all be together not have to say goodbye and I want to see you and Dad race brother Tom I do well there there'll be no bedding in heaven
