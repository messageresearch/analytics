was with him before the foundation of the world Amen so excuse me just appreciate all that good singing and the specials and whatnot and uh we really love that it's our joy amen and but to hear the word is uh is uh just one of the greatest things the Privileges I think that we have in uh in this life so we'll just get right to the word this evening uh Revelations CH 3 verse 10 I want to take a scripture from there and then go back over to Matthew 5 and read a few verses there excuse me now I want to apologize in advance to you tonight because you may have noticed I I speak a little bit differently than brother Dale quicker I'm talking the pace I'm talking about and uh somebody asked me I was preaching somewhere years ago in down South Carolina somebody asked me said brother Jim you used to be an Auctioneer I think it was the same time they asked me is that was that my was that my real hair I know people just wonder I've even had people get distracted over a tie that I wor and I just couldn't I couldn't even focus cuz some tie you had on I thought well Lord have mercy I you know it's easy to get distracted sometimes you know and uh Satan will be sure to distract you you know one way or another and uh so if we can just uh press on and uh just uh devote our minds to be attentive that's right uh to the word uh no one ever was an Auctioneer but you know if the preaching thing didn't work out perhaps there was a be yeah but I'm not here because I called myself to be here I was heading entirely in a different direction I was my senior year of school heading to law school and and all of a sudden lord said no that ain't what I called you for the Apostle Paul he said I've called you I've set you for the defense of the gospel I've called you to the gospel so so that's exactly uh amen what we do as we as we Minister his word so uh I might uh get maybe a good clip so I'll just warn you just if I talk quick just listen right so if God give a man ability to speak quick he he obviously give us the ability to listen quick too one mouth and two ear so you got the advantage on me so uh we just cuz you get 10% of it see yeah 10% of a big thing is more than 10% of a little thing say that's just the way my mind works so so we just uh just wanting to put uh our minds uh in remembrance tonight of things that you know uh as Peter said we speak these things to you not because you don't know them because you do know them so that you might be established see the in the present truth that's amen Revelation 3 verse 10 because thou has kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth and then Matthew Chapter 5 beginning at verse 10 Matthew CH 5 and verse 10 11 and 12 blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you tonight for my subject I want to just take uh the thought of the value of persecution am the value of persecution could you bow your heads with me just in a word of prayer kind and gracious Heavenly Father we present ourselves to you this evening Lord with no abilities of our own that we choose to use Lord but we surrender oursel now uh speaker not only speaker but hearer as well father may we hear with the hearing ear that the Lord hath given in the Seeing Eye father you said the entrance of your words would give light and give understanding to the simple father may that be our portion tonight David said again light is swn for the righteous and gladness for the upright in heart speak to us tonight speak to the hearts of your people tonight father weave this word as it comes forth uh the truth Lord into the fabric of our souls Lord give us strength to stand in this evil age G us up with strength and Truth tonight father we'll bless your name for it give you the honor and the glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and all of God's people said amen amen God bless you may return to the comfort of your seat the verses that I have read from Matthew's gospel tonight are taken from the notable Sermon on the Mount which begins with the the attitudes uh to this point uh he is spoken about the poor in spirit he's talking about they that mourn he's talked about the meek he's talked about they that hunger and thirst after righteousness he's talked about the merciful he's talked about the pure in heart right he's talked about the peacemakers and lastly he speaks about the persecuted right and what Jesus is doing he's first stating the condition that the believer needs to find himself in then he States the promise right in other words the meek what shall inherit the earth the merciful shall obtain Mercy the pure in heart they shall see God and so forth and he goes down through now excuse me a casual study of these Beatitudes will reveal that they contain a valuable lesson even for the Believers in this hour that's right and that's why I want to take this eth beatitude uh and look at some of the ramification of these verses as they relate to us the bride in this hour now in this beatitude Jesus in verse 10 he appears to be speaking uh of persecution on a personal level and through his teaching here he makes known to us that although it involves pain and suffering that it's really a normal part of discipleship uh just as being merciful or Meek or a peacemaker any of the others matter of fact on page 84 of the church 82 of the church H book brother man made this statement he said persecution and trials are a natural normal part of the Christian Life he said there's only one thing you can do about them commit them all to God judge not and leave their outworking and final judgment to him and so we've got some very practical advice that he's given us here now persecution still is not one of those things that we enjoy all right or that we particularly look forward to amen right but it's something we know that we need but in the flesh yeah you know I really don't want it but according to the prophet he said it's natural and it's normal so God's Got A Reason in it God's got a purpose in it and there is an end result that will result from that okay now to get us started tonight I want to remind you of several things the scripture says about persecution number one Jesus said it's a given it's a given persecution is in other words you can expect persecution it's not just kind of optional maybe it will maybe it won't no believer is exempt from persecution I said it last night the reality of our faith brother sister is this is it invites persecution just the very stand that you take right Jesus in John 16:33 made this statement he said these things have I spoken to you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation Affliction trouble anger anguish persecution but be of good cheer cuz I have overcome the world now we know brother bam said we're not going to go through the tribulation period it's not for the bride is that right cuz he's redeemed us unto himself and doesn't take a bride through the tribulation period but you will and you do have tribulation in life you have persecution right so we learned then that persecution is not only a giving a giving but Jesus said it's a blessing that's right amen a blessing he said it's a blessing Matthew 5 and: 10 blessed are they that are persecuted the third thing we learned he said it brings exceeding gladness now these are things believe it or not I'm reading these things right out of your Bible not really the way we perceive but see it's it's all about looking not through the not through the natural man the carnal life you know but but but looking through the eyes of the Lord Paul said Philippians 2:5 he said put on the mind of Christ so I want to think now through his through his mind so we know it's a given we know it's a blessing and it brings exceeding gladness Matthew 5:12 rejoice and be exceeding glad somebody say exceeding gladed glad for for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which before you right remember again over to Acts chapter 5 when the H when the Sanhedrin called to the apostles and they they forbid them to preach and they beat them they told them in Matthew I'm sorry acts 5:40 they commanded that they should not speak in jesus' name and they let them go verse 41 said they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing why that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name amen Rejoice praise God thank you Lord thank you Lord that I was Li thank you Lord that I that was was done wrong or mistreated or what not thank you Lord for that now the word rejoicing actually means to be glad or cheerful or joyful so so persecution I think like this persecution is a cause or an occasion for Joy are you with me and it's and of course uh again from verse 5 or chapter 5: 10 he says because of me so it is the cause uh Jesus is the cause of our persecution because of me so when we're taking sides with Jesus we'll experience what Jesus told us in John 15 and 20 he said if they persecuted me they will persecute you also Matthew 5:11 from my sake or because of me right so persecution will come because of the stand I take with the word made flesh am all right now if you to take a more thorough study of persecution in the Bible you'd find that it's actually revealed in a number of forms different ways that were persecuted According To Jesus and I'm just going down through very quickly because it's really not in my sermon but just kind of a little Foundation work according to the scripture Luke 6:22 we we can be persecuted verbally right uh we can be persecuted physically and the word persecute there uh it it means actually to chase away or pursue with hostile intent it literally means to be hunted down like an animal that sounds kind of familiar doesn't it remember the statement brother bam made and taking sides with Jesus he said during the tribulation period he said there will be the sleeping virgin will be hunted down by the dragon he said uh they'll search down take this woman remember her seat and we'll kill her right now that'll be in the tribulation period he said but the church will go home and questions and answers in the book of Hebrews he said the co- formal church is hunted down like dogs by the communist and Roman parties and when they're hunted down and killed he said they are are killed now yeah I want you to hold that thought in your minds just a little bit because in a few minutes I want to elaborate on just why they're hunted down you ever thought about that you say well I know why are they right why are they this is America this is the land of the free the home of the brave that's not some Socialist Party Russian but on American so we're talking about something happens here right and then and then he also talks about false accusations which come in a form of persecution uh blessed are you and men revile you and say all manner of evil against you for my sake brother mam said in the message speak to this rock in Jonesboro Arkansas if they call the Master of the House be Els up how much more will they call you that's right but blessed are you when you are for righteousness so this brother and sister we can expect as we serve the Lord amen because we know God has a purpose in allowing us to be be persecuted now again according to the scriptures persecution is used to help us develop a greater dependence upon the Lord second Corinthians 12:10 uh Paul said I take pleasure in infirmities Paul are you crazy right Paul understood something that we we've got to come to a like understand I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in Necessities in persecu and we get to this point we're up here praying oh God God help me preacher pray for me with all Paul said I take pleasure in it you need to go back to your seat and say thank you Lord for all this we say Lord take it away from I mean Paul said you ought to rejoice and thankful Lord for Paul says in distresses and persecutions and infirmities and reproaches and he said he said in distresses for the Lord's sake for when I'm weak that I'm strong most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ here it is now that the power of Christ May rest upon because power apart from character is what all right now it also cultivates righteousness and character 1 Peter 5:10 Al ultimately it'll qualify your you for your ultimate reward which is what which is heaven verse 10 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven so I think from this little capsule synopsis of personal persecution you can see that God places a great value right on persecution talking about the value of persecution now all of this that I've said it speaks of persecution that we experience as Believers and it certainly is a natural and normal part of the Christian Life and we truly must commit them to God and judge not and leave their outworking and final judgment to him now I think when we're done tonight brother sister we'll see the profound of that very simple stat right now I want to dig a Little Deeper tonight into the subject of persecution and more specifically a dispensational persecution that is to try the elect of God right in the mark of the beast in 1954 brother B says now in the last days there's coming a persecution right he didn't say just persecution didn't say a p uh or little persecution or some persecution he said a singular persecution right in the message Jezebel religion Middletown Ohio 1961 he said there there there will come a persecution yeah he says the Bible says so so he's getting this from the scripture right he goes thus sayth the Lord certainly there will be will be what a persecution thus saith the Lord now in the message out denomination on on uh 1958 brother bam says now he said now you just mark it down take your pens out your paper Mark in the FL he said you mark this down it's not everything he said Mark down but when he tells us to Mark something down then it's it's indelibly inscribed there the fly leaf of our Bible it's something we can go back and read over and over and over and over you don't want to forget this right he said Mark this down jot this down he said uh he said you just got to mark it down you got to mark it down he said we we now the elect the bride the church we are coming to a religious persecution right he said we are coming to that he said with the same things now watch the same things that they did in Pagan Rome many years ago for it's thus saith the Lord now you think Titus here think Constantine here think of the murder of the 68 million Christians here he goes what is it he said setting upon a beast a power now watch this as we to build this so the prophet is telling us here brother and sister that there will be a time prior to the tribulation period uh which would be a time an era if you will of satanic rule where Satan will set up his Eden and he'll be crowned as the God of this age I think that's where we are commenting on this brother bam said it will be so right so enlightening and and lifegiving amen that it'll fool the world oh in other words only the elect now right only this one in the million is not going to be fooled by this that he's talking about here tonight right amen now you know why we're not going to be fooled with because God so greatly loves his bride that he's given us now a clear understanding and a correct knowledge of what's going to take place very soon now on American soul before we're translated amen Isaiah 33 and5 Isaiah prophesied said the Lord is exalted for he dwelleth on high he hath filled Zion how many knows who Zion is it's the bride he has filled Zion with judgment and righteousness all right so what he's promised to do fill our hearts with judgment and righteousness all right so she's the bride what's God done with her in this hour filled her with judgment and righteousness what is righteousness on paragraph 161 of the message it be behooveth us to fulfill all righteousness brother mam said of course righteousness is his word he's filled us with judgment he's filling us with the word is that right Isaiah 33 and six said and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times amen what's going to what's going to be the stability of our times wisdom and knowledge not emotion and feelings and Sensations running the a and bubble dancing and jumping the that's all fine and dendy right but you're not going to get established with with that he said wisdom and knowledge is what will stabilize you in this hour Proverbs 4:7 the wise man wrote Solomon said wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding well how am I going to get this understanding how do I get this understanding well Jeremiah 3:15 he said I will give you pastors amen come on huh according to my heart God says I'm going to choose the pastors we talk about the ministry today he says he says I'll give you pastors according to mine heart and they shall feed you with wisdom and understanding that's why your pastor Labor Service in service out Amen to go into that golden pot filled with Mana to bring it to the children of God because he's feeding you with something he's feeding you with wisdom he's feeding you with knowledge amen amen so what what's he saying so I've got to get this understanding well if you'll if you'll be at your post of Duty if you'll be at the house of God when the door is open you'll be able to you'll be able to feed from this wisdom and understanding that your pastor has labored to bring you come on say Amen all right now the scripture said second second Thessalonians chapter 2 Paul speaks of an end time apostasy a falling away second Timothy 3 states for perilous times shall come stressful times difficult times times difficult to cope with second Timothy 4 tells us there'll be a time where people will not even endure sound Doctrine but they'll Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears right right 1 Timothy 4:1 the spirit speaks expressly that means he's prophesying that in the latter days many will depart from the faith giving heed to seducing Spirits deceiving spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies and hypocrisy having their conscience seared with the hot iron that's the entire condition that's before us here that's right so these would be just a few of the many scriptures that revealed to us that the bride would be warned and would indeed be made aware that there is to come upon this world what John referred to in Revelation 3:10 as the hour of Temptation we read it earlier that brother Adam said would preced the Rapture and the Earth then would enter into a time in which the powers of darkness and the withdrawing of the Holy Spirit would together create an atmosphere of Temptation and deception that would be so great that except for the grace of God to a small elected group there'd be none on the earth who'd be able to withstand right don't think brother sister for one what I don't care how long you've been in the message I don't care how much you know or don't know don't think for one minute that you or I could alone stand the temptation of this house in the message Israel brother Adam said watch it's moving right out today in a terrible force all around it behooves you my brother sister to consider what you're listening at Jesus said be careful how you hear didn't he say brother man said and don't you never underestimate Satan's power for deceiving don't you ever underestimating for he's as smooth as he can be that's right so the Bible tells us that in this hour that all would be deceived the whole Earth all but just the very elect and that's only because God has decreed it to be so right so he gives us a special provision a special Enlightenment an anointing if you will to carry us to preserve us through this time Glory but the rest of the world totally succumbs to the hour of Temptation in other words no one withstands it outside of the predestination now I'm talking about an oncoming persecution tonight but before I get into the particulars of it let me remind you of what the prophet of God said that brings it on now on page 312 of the church age book in the Philadelphian age brother bam actually quotes he's reading Revelations 3:10 because I was kept the word of my patience I'll keep you from the hour of Temptation which will come upon the world to try them upon the earth now two words two words I want to Define for you the first is Temptation the hour of Temptation the word is in a greater a better translation would would have been trial or proving in the Greek it speaks of a man's of the trial of a man's Fidelity or his Integrity or his virtue or his endurance Jesus has formerly said they that endure to the end the same shall be saved the message version translation in verse 10 says I'll keep you safe in the time of testing that will be here soon right now the next word is the word try it's coming on all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth amen all right now try simply means to test for the purpose of ascertaining its quality or what he thinks or how he'll behave himself so what's God looking for when he brings a test to see how you will behave yourself then brother mam say the best thing God could ever do for you is bring you a test to give you a test because he wants to ascertain your maturity where where you're at how you'll react and so forth by Said by our faith he says how he said is our faith and our choices he said reflects the decisions and the choices that we make he said reflects our faith to God our Revelation you make choices you're presented with with decisions and all of these God requires us to make uh according to the word he said reflects our faith uh I believe to God so the trial then is to ascertain from us how we'll behave what we think it means to test our faith our virtal or character by enticement to sin it means to afflict e evils upon one in order to prove his character and the steadfastness of his faith right to challenge him as it were to give proof to his Perfections amen not his imperfections but his Perfection remember what we're talking about last night being made perfect all right so then the persecution comes to give proof to your Perfections all right so now now we're in the process being made perfect spiritual just men made perfect so forth now the characters being molded in our adoption placing and so forth then the find any words it's like we're in a classroom right yeah but then there's a test coming see always at the end of the class you got a test coming oh yeah see it's not really how much but it's when you get down to the test how much of it really has become has you know just metabolized into the into the Christian experience right so we've got to understand then that this hour of Temptation when it comes will be the the final test brother bam been talking about Abraham and possessing the enemy's Gates remember what he said he said and God Time After Time tested him Abraham now right he said but then he'd come to that final test before the blessing was going to happen right and that's the way it is with all the Seed of Abraham God gives us that final test just before before he gives the promise all right now in the in the in the church book page 313 uh brother bam said for This Promise talking about the hour of Temptation has to do with the end time I'm sorry with the end of the Gentile period yeah you talking about now this our Temptation This that's come upon all the world a trial all that's on the world y he said has to do with the end time the end of the Gentile period which culminates in the tribulation period he guys placing that right see it's it's not speaking of the tribulation period but it will terminate or it will climaxed or it will conclude in the tribulation period you see that now amen so it will begin now before the tribulation period a short little space the hour of trial hour and then it will accumulate or it will culminate it will end and then the rest will go into the tribulation period all right you see that right now now it begins to explain the verse paragraph 2 page 312 I'll keep you from the hour of Temptation which will come upon all the world try them that dwell upon the Earth he said this is not a declaration that the true church will go into and through the tribulation if it meant that it would have said that but it said I'll keep you from right the AR Temptation he said the Temptation is exactly like the Temptation in Eden it'll be a very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition yeah to God's commanded word and yet from the standpoint of human reasoning see that's why Paul in Hebrews uh Romans chapter 8 he talks about you know walking in the faith walking in the walking in the spirit Walking In the Flesh walking as a caral man walking as a spiritual man and Paul said if you continue to be Carly minded he said you're going to die because the carnal minded man who's going to use human reasoning is going to look at this thing as so enlightening so lifegiving he said to fool all but the very elect but it will be presented in stark contrast and in direct opposition to the word of God that we received through a prophet and that's why brother man said you better mark this down and take heed to these things that he's he's warning us of so he said from the standpoint of human reasoning which has always been the enemy of Faith right it'll be so right so enlightened give life giv to fool the world on the ver like not be full of Temptation will come as follows the acumenical move that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling Christ's prayer that we all might be one becomes so strong politically that she Bears pressure on the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adherence to principles enacted into law so that no people will be recognized as actual churches unless under direct or indirect domination of this Council now I'm will come back to this statement here in just a minute uh but I want to add this since World War II the world has been preparing for a one world government did you know that it started with with an organization called the League of Nations it name has now been changed to the UN of the United Nations let me just read a statement to you on page 320 of the church H book brother mam said when the Ancients called leosia the Metropolis it was looking forward to the One World Government that we are now setting up right there's a prophet of God now here's a Watchman on the wall he's called up to look over to another oh I see what said he comes back and he tells us now he said this one world government he said which is now being set up as we think of that City being the location of the great church Council we see foreshadowed the E commical move taking place today wherein very soon we will see something we're going to see we will see all the so-called Christians come together indeed the church in the state religion and politics are all coming together the tears are being bound the weed will soon be ready for the G now it's pretty plain to see that the goal of this organization has been to rule the world right and now it's come to pass that Any Nation large or small who does not abide by their rules has got to pay the penalty now we've not been too concerned about this powerful un ruling over other nations but we're fast approaching a time where our country America herself will soon feel the brunt force and the influence of its power amen because the US who's backed by this powerful un force will soon be engaged in enforcing the mark of the beast on America's own soil but before this happens now the economy has to collapse America has to go bankrupt the dollar will have to die and the US debt will spiral so much out of control there'll be absolutely no way to pay it off right amen now I got a number AR at home in my study to show that's exactly what we're just on the road to that now we're just right at the place now so the bubble is about to burst brother sister the stage is certainly set now for this one world government to take over now brother bam made it very clear from the scriptures Revelation 13 11-17 the lamb nation that became a dragon is none other he said in the United States and he the US had power to give life into the image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should most speak and cause as many as would not worship the image should be killed right then in mark of the beast brother bam in referring to the above scripture said that's the boycott know you know these things right it's from about this time in 1954 brother began brother Brandon began to field questions on the mark of the beast yeah and he always directed The Listener to a religious boycott that was soon to come remember that let me read to you a statement in questions and answers image of the beast in 1954 he said somebody asked me today two or three times I've been asked it brother man speaking on the mark of the beast don't you believe they'll tattoo a number in your head or tattoo something in your hand he said no sir don't never look at that it'll be a boycott certainly no man could buy s unless he belongs to the confederation of churches that's true it'll come like a union unionizing the thing bringing it down unionized religion mark my word it ain't far off and you'll see it it's just around the corner all right so he says before it's all said and done now we're going to see this unionizing of religion all right that what he said now in the tharan church age in 1960 in the in the Revelation Jesus Christ series he says now we believe the hour is close at hand now father when these churches is confederating themselves together making an image to the Beast and it'll be terrible on that group Lord that won't won't join it right now we're bringing the bride into Focus now don't be terrible on that group that won't join it the very boyot will come but in that hour you promise to take your church but now now watch here watch the the sequence now he goes help us Lord so he's telling us now that America who's a leader of the UN will very soon force a union of churches and everybody outside this church is going to be persecuted many is even going to be killed now listen to what he said in the message position position of in Christ are you listening amen now listen to this he says in 1960 in Jeffersonville he says 1500 years of pagan persecution when they forced everybody and killed them murdered them strung them up put an ox on one hand and an ox on the other hand and made him either kiss the crucifix or start them oxes out one this way and how many knows what's going to happen my arm is tied to an ox on either end and I refuse to kiss the cross yeah something's going to give way thatx is probably a little bit stronger you know something's going to split in two right and it ain't going to be the ox right so he said he said that's the way they used to do that so they made business back then didn't they right and uh and brother bam says I put my hand right in Switzerland behind the post where they stood there and cut their tongues out and called them witches and everything else he said that's exactly right right and we'd go wow more I'm glad I'm living in this Earth yeah brother B said very next paragraph he says and that Same Spirit exists today that's right brother amen exactly he said it's just the law that holds it down just a law on It come on just just a law now that holds it down can't do it why can't do it now why there's a law against it he says but wait till it gets its freedom oh my God what it gets it fre that Spirit right what happens when that law is repealed or that law is deactivated what happens then he said just wait till the spirit gets you mean that Spirit going to get his freedom he said yeah you just wait till it does right prophet of God's tapped into something he's seeing something now he said the Bible said so just wait till it shows its colors it gets a chance to you might vote it in pretty soon for all I know oh my now we know that you can't just vote in a law per se right you can't just vote in a law well I like that law let's just vote it in I going go that the way you work but you can vote in a man that will sign that house resolution into law now my personal opinion is that we've already done that right already done that and I'll get to it in just a few minutes all right you still with me am so he says wait till it gets his freedom that spirit so one day it will he said the Bible said so so again he's seeing this in scripture he said just way that shows its colors you might vote in pretty soon for all I know it'll come there's no way of keeping it out it's got to come that's right it's got to come it's coming and when it does you just watch right well I guarantee you I'll be watching that ain't something's got to slap me in the face I ain't got a revelation that I'll see that we'll see that but so it's something he said he said now watch it now he just watch that but brother he said you want to know this one thing I know whom I have believed amen watching right on he said that's it spoken words we asual see uh paragraph 85 he said now that's the way it'll wind up it'll be a union a boycott all such places as this here will be closed down and you'll not be able to speak unless you got permission or a license from this Federation of churches to hold a service so that'll be an option that brother Dale and I at some point will have well I know I know what my decision is going to be and I think I know what decision your pastor is going to make also on that he's had a very difficult time now that's coming but watch here how many those God got a purpose in this to take place it's the test is coming the final test now many years ago actually in the third Century you realize there was an office that emerged was created uh in the world that office was the pope of Rome from which a man has come brother M call him Satan Superman uh he's been accepted by most of the world as their spiritual leader their father in The Gospel why the greatest names in Protestant America have declared him to be the moral leader of the West well knowing this and knowing that these same spiritual leaders are now controlling our government through the voting hes we can see how America's soon going to be exercising all the power that the Beast had before which Beast was wrome now how many knows that the goal of Rome has always been to rule the world through the church and how many remembers brother bam telling us in Satan's Eden that he's had marvelous success in carrying out every threat that he's made against the church marvelous success now let's just take a few minutes and look at this this persecution or this squeeze as brother B used the term that he talked about that's coming upon the True Vine believer amen that's it in Revelation 13:1 15 and he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed now on page 131 of the church age book brother Bam's just been talking about how the devil through the old Roman governors had been hurling Christians by the thousands to their death had been destroying them by the Lions and the Gladiators and how the Roman Catholic Church killed the multitude of Believers in the Dark Ages then he makes this statement he says you think that's shocking yeah yeah I do brother man he said just wait till the prophecy of Revelation 13 is fulfilled so you see what he's comparing our Revelation 13:15 with now you see what he's comparing it with now all of those the Gladiators and the Lions and the p and all of those things read Fox's book of martyr Smuckers glorious alation all those things he said you think that shocking he said just wait now till this prophecy is fulfilled wow whoa right he said it is strikingly true that the United States of America is in this chapter the very number 13 is a symbol of this nation it started with 13 colonies its flag is 13 stars 13 stripes there's her identity I'm sorry there is her Destiny in the 13th chapter the imagees mentioned in the chapter will be found in all wickedness of the Beast that was before it as the Beast Rose at the Nan Council so the image will come out of the World Council churches with all ungodly and satanic power now watch to vent the anger of the devil upon the True Vine of God right that's right who's the anger of the devil going to be vented upon the True Vine of God we're talking about the value now of persecution the blessing of persecution it's going to be hard to say well praise God there's an ox over there there's an box over there wonder what they going to do with their box that's put it together now what to vent the anger of the devil upon the True Vine of God it will be a Repeat Performance of all diabolical cunning and cruelty right I mean know what a Repeat Performance is exactly Repeat Performance would be if I took my notes and preached this again tomorrow morning that would be Repeat Performance and you say well that's the same thing that he said last night this is the same thing that happened way back then exactly see what's he talking about he's talking about that persecution that he said thus sayith the Lord is coming that's one of the first statements I read to you tonight from Jezebel religion remember right he said there'll come a persecution not the tribulation period now we ain't going into that my God how much worse is that going to be right if this is what we're looking at before the tribulation my God what's the what's it going be back there amen he he said thus sayith the Lord there it will be right now going back to resume of the ages of the church age book page 376 he said the false Church groups will come together in a world Council of churches the World Council of churches is the image directed to the Beast Revelation 13 11-18 now remember it was Imperial Pagan Rome that fell by the sword but she was healed of her Deathstroke when she joined the nominal Christian Church of Rome and Incorporated paganism and Christianity thereby became the Holy Roman Empire which was to endure till Jesus came and destroyed her but Rome is not going it alone her daughters are right with her and she'll take over absolute Authority by the World Council of churches right he goes now this may seem farfetched to some but actually it's very plain for all to see because right now the church are controlling politics what I thought it was the Electoral College I thought it was the you know the Rockefellers and the Rothchilds and the Illuminati and all of this other stuff no the prophet of God said the churches are controlling politics amen and at the opportune time there's always a time always a season brother at the opportune time will manifest exactly how great that control is it might not very be very obvious now how great the control is but at the opportune time we will see how listen this message just as current is tomorrow's newspaper I'm sorry yeah it is right it manifest exactly how great that control is The ecumenical move will end up with Rome at the head even though the people really didn't Envision it that way this is so because in Revelations 17 3-6 it states that the mystery Babylon is Seated on the beach she's controlling the last or fourth Empire the Roman Church is doing that with the World Church system under her Rome will be controlling and this image church system will be obedient to Rome because Rome controls the gold of the world th all the people have to belong to the World Church system or be at the mercy of the elements for they cannot buy or sell without the mark of the beast in the hand or him amen exactly the mark of the hand means they'll have to take the doctrine of the World Church system which is trinitarianism and the mark of the hand which means to do the will of the World Church now watch he says with this great power the church systems will persecute the true bride right amen now do you see let me just stop there do you see that we're not just going to you know come to church come and go come and go go God bless you praise the Lord and all of a sudden just be whed away we're gone just want wo us we're gone you hear these things the prophet of God is saying all right with this great power and to me I'm and maybe I'm gracious but I'm looking forward to this amen I'm looking forward to this oh kill somebody's guitar up here I've done it before not you see what I'm saying right because brother B said this is this is to ascertain the quality of what well bless God I'm this I'm that well yeah you say you are but wait till the test comes we'll find out it'll weed it out now it'll shift out the truth amen who's got it who don't who's got an experience who's got a confession yes it will yes sir amen great time coming friend amen you say glory to God glory to God with this great power now the church systems will persecute the true bride this a the tribulation period but this is a persecution angel said oh Jesus said oh you're just blessed Glory oh you're just blessed he said the image what will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching somebody say will try they will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching right her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and Truth to the people who need it but before the Antichrist in person takes over the complete World System of churches the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the Lord God will catch away his Bri for the great marriage amen amen so we'll be here for at least oh a marginal time a preliminary stage if you will of Satan's plan to take over the complete World System of churches through the World Council we'll definitely be here for little short season after this process is started and while the persecution is on and I'll show you why in just a minute why we have to be here during this time cuz the prophet deals with that also now in the message what shall I do with Jesus called Christ in November 1963 brother bam said now in the Council of churches all the churches must belong to this Council right even the bride churches all churches or if they don't you're not allowed to preach see that's that's that's that's that's the drawback see we're not going to join it so what's the what's the penalty what's the punishment can't preach he says so if you don't you're not allowed to preach but you know we will right you know we ain't going to we ain't going to stop having church just because they Clos the building you got 270 Acres out there we you can find a spot out there somewhere to pre you it may take them a while to find you but you get out there somewhere long you got your boots on in the gator to get out there or a golf cart or whatever you can you can go to church you know I mean it's easy to getting your brother Air Conditional Cadillac come 5 miles to get to church now but brother B said you about our forefathers he said some of them had to fight indans to get to church you know bang bang bang bang hang dad come bang bang bang bang bang he said some up he said when it was snowing and whatnot he said they' get the horse the Bucky the sled and whatnot and just jump on to get to go to church i' have you to get to right you ain't going to stop the seat the god get Church like a duck to a water water FR it's like a Martin to his Gore amen D David said my desire who he was he was uh his his desire he was after the heart of God right David's heart the heart of David was was after the heart of God and David said he said he said said my desire is to be in the house of the Lord all the days of my life that I might inquire in his Temple and behold the beauty of the Lord right amen amen amen but I watch he said this image will try to now try to but not going to all right you're not allowed to preach he said he said uh you're not even allowed to have prayer for the sick right and your church can be used for anything they wanted to for if they close if they store they can store boxes in it ammunition in it whatever they want to do you got no control over it exactly you either belong to the Council of churches or you don't belong at all that's the system that being formed here in the United States now watch this that fulfills the scripture to the dot right he said it fulfills what the Lord spoke to me back in 1933 I looked it I thought what in the Lord what did the Lord speak to him in 1933 and I began to look at go back there you know what I found in 1933 brother Bram said the Lord spoke to him a vision give him a vision in 1933 and the Lord showed him seven things that would take place are transpired before what he called in Daniel 7 weeks the great consummation see what's he referring here to what he's referring here to is the great vision of the woman that he saw who would rise up now in America the Lord told him see on the sixth Vision he said be spiritual see the first five were natural you know the magal line and this would take into the isms and so forth and then when he come to the six he says now be spiritual shift from the natural now to the spiritual he said she'd be cruel in heart beautiful to look at would leader God this country to ruination and he identifies right here now that it's the World Council of churches and did you know that actually five times after the opening of the seals he identified it to be the World Council of churches this this woman he's talking about you just have to follow progression as he brings it up in souls in prison he said the Council of churches over there now meeting in Rome he said that's just exactly what's wrote on my book of Prophecy in 1933 that would take place and on 30 of this message he really blasted David duplicities for going over to Rome you know for that ecumenical that ecumenical council and he says again on paragraph 6 of page 35 he said the first word said it first the word said it then the spirit of the Lord said in 33 told all these other things that would happen he said and here it is it's never failed and here we see it shaping up Jehovah gy he said listen it showed that'd be an ecumenical council how all the churches would come together would form the image in the mark of the beast and he says he gave me seven things that would happen every one of them has come to pass now uh leadership she's head for the World Council of church the EIC coun that's where she's gone right back to WR where she come from I got it wrote back on paper from 25 years ago 33 years ago not only that it's wrote in the Bible from a vision amen he said now she's gone back no way Sav it's gone got to be that way now back to our subject can I take just a few more minutes amen he says now in church order he says now where we're here he said to hold a standard in this even that when the world is dark and and the whole world kingdom is going into the Council of churches pretty soon they'll tack a sign on this door they'll try to tack a sign on this door here closed and then we're going to have to meet other places cuz they'll certainly close these churches right now he's preaching in brandham Tabernacle and so he's talking about brandom Tabernacle too but but but he's telling us that that that he's not going to stop preaching just because the church billing his CL right and that's what he's talking about in Christ's mystery when he said she'll not be closed up she'll be taken out all right so he so he said we'll have to meet other places in other words no we a we we ain't taking a card we ain't joining up with that thing we'll just meet other places cuz the building that's all it is is just a building he said one of these days if we don't take the mark of the beast and we're depending on staying true to god Till Death sets us free and that's what we intend to do amen so on and on and over and over he goes on to warn the Bride of this hour of persecution is is coming so we wouldn't be ignorant of what's next on God's prophetic calendar then in December 1963 and I really love this he begins to talk about the power of the third poll in that hour and its relation to the bride and you know where I'm going page six Look Away to Jesus he says I'm going to say something to you now he said I said had said all along that is the very thing we've looked forward to so long for many years four or five years maybe longer the third pull has been Vindicated I'm sure you know what it is remember there'll be many impersonations of that but not this it came be it's in existence and I'm warned of this that soon right now it just happened so it could identify its presence among you but now watch it'll not be used in a great way until this Council begins to tighten up exactly I'm about the third Po and all of the things you can associate with the third po might and we say my God they were great things he said well a great way so what's coming out is going to be a great thing compared to just what Aver things I don't know it'll not be used in a great way until the council begins to up and when it does when that does the Pentecostals and so forth oh they almost impers anything that can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you have seen temporarily right see under his ministry be manifested in the fullness of his power so see these adopted Sons adopted Sons manifested Sons are coming to this now the end result of they're placing now the character is form she standing she knows she knows all about it now right the perfect interpretation understand all of that now wisdom understanding knowledge now she's standing there is redeemed Sons adoped Sons now he says now you're going to see the third Po manifested in the fullest power like it that's through you and you and you and you and you and you but the character's got to be there first see so it's not going to be used in a great way that is in the fullness of its power right until the Council of churches begins to tighten up in other words when the squeeze comes down that's when the third pull will be fully manifested in in the bride and on display is that what he said amen so now now we're beginning to see a purpose for this persecution now that's being prophesied we're beginning to see this now the squeeze coming on now I differ from and I love the brothers I differ from the return Ministry brothers who believe that brother Adam is going to have a prophet Resurrection we talk about today to come forth and finish this third pull Ministry there's a lot of deviations to this got private Ministry brother do the third pull and soore but I tell you one thing they're going to have a pretty hard time with this quote if they don't see the BR not only possesses the power of the spoken word but she is the one that's ordained to operate this when the squeeze tightens up am brother ad spoke the words of original C he says now notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything to C the Father the father showed him first Harmony between God and Christ see John 5:19 so will the bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death but if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here's the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word that's why we've got our instructions and know what he wants done with the word what he's telling us here tonight even and she does it in his name she has thus sayth the Lord amen I'm know the final voice Amen on her messenger is in the bride I'm sorry somebody wants to put everything in the profit but you got to realize there's a part for you and me to play in this great Plan of Redemption the prophet's not here anymore he's playing role his ministry is over it's completed it's fulfilled he's done what was written of him to do it's Bri time now brother and sister Elijah's manle amen is falling upon the life he says now then it is gerti so the Holy Spirit wers it till it's grown and serves his purpose they do only his will no one can persuade them different they have thus sayith the Lord they keep still then they will do the works of God for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he did complete in his day all things when he was here didn't complete when he was here for it wasn't time yet but now on the bride coming of Christ it is time to fulfill Serv now in back to look away to Jesus brother bam says therefore you've had the word you know what to look for and you know how to stand right see so we can say now we've read enough tonight to show you that I know you'd be able to say Amen brother B I know what to look for and I know how to stand rightly tell us this so we go yeah okay yeah we do brother I don't think I recall too many other times when brother actually pointed to something and said look for this to happen right when you see this happen watch for this to happen right because when it does he says in the next paragraph this will be the thing that will start the rapturing faith for the going away all right so we're going to connect here one thing with another see when this happens he said then that has to follow now my in my opinion this will be the thing that will that will transform our our passive faith and transition it to an active faith for the hours approaching swiftly now reading again he said uh when something is going to be done I'm dropping back here watching that spot waiting for the time to use it because it's going to be used he's talking about the third P Glory it's going to be used and everyone knows that for certain is the first was identified the second is being first P second you then you think real closely you who are spiritual now the Bible said here's to him who has wisdom the third is a properly identified we know where it is so the third p is here all right I said on page six he said this will be the thing that will start or activate or put into action the rapturing faith for the going of going away right one definition of start means to launch this will be the thing that launches it he says I got lay quiet for a while we're right at the age now can't go any farther absolutely can't go any farther because they know they don't know whether ain's coming we know that we've Advanced to the top of the pyramid is that right we've come full circle Alpha has become Omega life is in the grain again Christ has reproduced himself in the bride the prophecies are all filled except the Diabolical manifestation of the image she's still working out there that's it all right brother mam still now page seven look over Jesus there's coming A Time In This Nation to where the nation is going to exercise all the power that the Beast had which was Pagan Rome and it became Pap Rome a church that this nation will do that Revelation 13 fully explains it Mak it a power that will force all Protestants like the union you'll have to be in the Council of churches you won't be able to have Fellowship now persons like ourselves we're going to be cut out of that all together persons like our we're going to be cut out of that all together he said that is exactly it's tightening and then when that time comes and the press the squeeze comes to a place where you're all we pressed out then watch what I'm fixing to tell you watch the third pull then yep right right see now we're going to need we're going to need something we're going to need a benefit an AG something we're going to need this because listen you can't buy you can't sell you can't do this probably can't get gas can't do this that and the other you know what we're just going to be helpless in a natural sense can't do this I mean my visas don't work my Master Card don't work my my my my my stocks my bonds my this my that all of my treasury bills all of these stuff nothing works I'm done I'm out cash is no good this that the other can't do this B we're just St now God says that's just where I want you now open your mouth and speak she has thus say the Lord Jesus said when you pray give us this day our daily bread we haven't had to pray that yet we say well that's spiritual that's super god Through the Ages give us our Breck yeah but how about brother there a compound meeting there that's right it might come a time you might have to gather around about dinner time well what are we have ain't nothing on the table well they going to be in just a minute let's pray father give us this deal bre if you can bring bread you can bring turkey or you can bring venison or you can bring whatever you whatever right and he'll set something there I'm told about elij you know he's running from Jezebel he said don't worry about a meal he said I'm going to have it catered in by the croes we read about that we go oh praise God remember were Bible days what that wonderful what God did what God did what God did listen this is a now Fai this is a now God what God did what God going to do what God is do that's what's exciting that's what that's what uh that's what's exciting right amen huh yeah now watch what he goes on to say watch this it'll be absolutely to the total loss see but it will be for the bride and the church now watch this in Shalom s sista amazing watch this shista Arizona 1964 January 12 he said and we all know that the identification we know what the third pull is we all understand that you have the tape he says now I think it'll just lay dormant for a little while the Third third po yes sir cuz we look around and say Pastor why all this taking place and that taking place and eyes over blind eyes this getting up out of the beds and the Wheelchairs and all well that third Pole's dormant right now he said it'll be dormant for a while you know what dormant means when something is dormant according to the dictionary it's in an inactive State it's temporarily inactive or not in use the D dictionary Likens it as a volcano that's not erupting but neither is it extinct we're sitting on the volcano friend we might feel the smoke feel the heat a little bit but it hadn't erupted yet amen cuz God's still working on me see that's another phase of this talk about we got to come to the Perfection being made perfect we're still in that phase now right see so the volcano it's here but ain't erupted yet right and that describes very nicely the third pool if you ask me like the volcano we know it's here it's not extinct but it's just not time yet for it to erupt right right brother B teach us to principle of times and Seasons y that God has a time God has a season for all things yes he did so it's not enough to go out there and grab a scripture try to make it work it's got to be the time and the season for it to happen I've talked for number of years what I call the John 5:19 principle brother man quote law many times Jesus answered said verely I said to you the son can do nothing of himself but what he see the father do for what things soever he doth and the son doeth likewise see and brother man I read a moment ago 120 spoken word Original Seed he said the harmony that existed between the father and the son is now to exist between Christ and his bride then he quoted John 5:19 right Jesus didn't arbitrarily go out there and do this and do that he went to the pool of Sal he walked through maybe 100 people and touch one person that made protic trouble right right see now you know if mother terca would have been there she' probably been there for four or five days praying and ministering and whatnot bandaging all that stuff Jesus W excuse me pardon me oh that looks bad you get that Ted to oh you got put a SP on that over there Jesus t no no I'm sorry just go hey get up come let's go right that's Jesus that's comp oh he didn't have compassion brother said compassion human sympathy right he didn't move with human sympathy right he said compassion is doing the will of God father show him one he's that man over that's the one I want okay right exactly amen so that tells me that John 5:19 applies to the bride even it is applied to Jesus himself same as John 10:30 I and my father are one right brother man said on page 18 he's not there with the shark but you can come to say I'm my father one and all these other things he said then the shark begins to pull away why because you're seeing who you are you're begin to give voice to that now which God has revealed to you in your own heart right amen rising of the sun page 34 brother said the same word that spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride you want to have fun with that and go in the scripture and see all the scriptures that pertain to Jesus brother said the same word speaks to him now speaks to you I'm a father one heart now all about all these other thingsall that don't put you on a series in the last for a while no yeah it would so if Jesus could do nothing until the father showed him first what do you think you're going to go out there and do what do you think you're going to go out there and do for God in the absence of a direct word from heaven we all going step out there and boy storm disappear that the other you know and maybe from time to time maybe something will come to pass but here but here John 5:19 here's our parameters right we do nothing until God instructs us to do it first right amen amen H yes sir God wants you to have something Heist he'll bring you to you right you can't go out and get something Prophet told us just to be patient wait for him to bring it to you God wants you have to bring it to you you can't miss it so he goes on to say I think it'll just lay dormant the third pulled out until the great hour of persecution comes on Glory praise God we're going to manifest the the third yeah it a't going to be the persecution oh I don't want that I want this without I want the milk without the cow it don't work that way I want the chicken without the feathers and without the bones so I have to go to AR I guess to get yes that's an inside joke I guess yall probably don't know he says until the great hour of persecution comes on he said that's when it'll speak right right it'll be manifested watch just like the five straight signs without failure perfectly right what's he talking about y had he right sister meus tumor speaking those squirrels into existence the Colorado Storm the little fish that laid dead in the water for about the space of half an hour then it resurrected right I want you to know that all five of these instances speaking of the word they were done at the command of the Lord the prophet of God did just arbitrarily go out there well I'm going to do this that's a storm coming up and I really want to hunt yeah I'm just going to get up here well now in the name of the Lord Jesus this storm going every one of these things the Lord instructed brother just sit back sit back and wait sit back and wait we're helpless helpless that's why we some fall in our face too much well I'm going to get out and do this do this do this do this lot of times it just doesn't come together like that s because we lack the inspiration to do those and that's what brother I'm taught us Faith was it's a revelation if God reveals something one way or another however then yes it'll be done it is th say the Lord Amen brother B says now I think just wait just see what it does there we go let's just see what it does unfailing words of Promise Phoenix 1964 he says now that great gift others I've tried to explain and say how it was done just get me explained just wait it'll not be in operation so perfectly now just wait till that Council of churches brings on that persecution that's when it'll happen oh it don't get much clearer than this brother and sister that's when what will happen that's when the full manifestation of the third po that's been dormant in the BR that's when it will erupt Vol that's when it become active and no longer dant do you see it wait on let Council churches brings on that persecution that's when it'll happen so if the fullness of the third pull is going to be manifest in the bride and that's not going to happen to the Council of churches brings of persecution and we got to see that the bride will absolutely be here at least for short duration during that time of persecution to fully fully manifest that third pool amen I I I want to see that I want to be a part of that amen amen yes sir so we learn here that during the time of the squeeze or the time that the church state has become one and is forcing their beliefs on everybody it's at that time the prophet of God said watch the third P then right other words it'll be manifested in his power that's when it'll happen he said that's when you'll see those scriptures come to life that you've been praying about and wondering why they hadn't been working for you Mark 11:23 say to this mountain speak that say that ask what you will whatever you say see see what I'm saying Time of the Season amen only only once he said third pole opening the word the Myst is revealed remember the third pole was he opening the s uh to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word amen amen so the third point is what it is the true bride's message it's the king sword it's the tent Vision it's the opening of the S it's the Mysteries revealed but it's also Mark 11:23 it's John 14:12 as was manifested in the prophet's Ministry in the creation of the squirrels hady right the tumor T the Colorado Storm little fish giving back his life it's what the bride is coming to and will come to before the Rapture and it'll take a squeeze to bring it on amen that's right it happened first in the prophet but through the word he preached the bride was to re receive what a faith to manifest that third pull also when the squeeze comes watch the third pull then amen all right now listen in the absence of a prophet who's going to manifest it the only one here that can manifest it that's right see now we'll say Amen here cuz we believe that but you wouldn't believe the scores of messes brothers that believe that the brides got nothing to do whatsoever with the third point they say it was a prophet's Ministry and none dare outside of that Prophet have anything to do with it therefore brother Adam's got to come back in a prophet Resurrection manifest the fullness of the third poor right I feel sorry for them fell they going miss out all this good stuff well we got our we we got our our arms and elbows up to a honey up elbows in a honey bucket they going to be out here wondering this well where's brother coming where's brother brother brother they better be call him Jesus Jesus Jesus Oh Lord that's right said today brother be the last one see on the scene absolutely what are yall talking about won't you get in the message and read what I said 40 years ago but I thought this I thought that and he said didn't I tell you didn't I tell you got no thought coming all right before I close can I take just a just another minute here why the devil's crowd a even got started yet here Saturday night it even was 8:30 right we'll be out for midnight might be on 10 minutes but listen you love the word I know that you on page 361 the church age book brother man says the lay of seen age ends in a blackout of the word thereby causing a departure of the Lord from the MST he stands outside calling to his own who follow him by obedience to the word watch after a short and Powerful demonstration of the Spirit come he talking aboutuh that's right amen who's here to do it after a short and Powerful demonstration of the spirit this little hunted and persecuted group will go to be with Jesus see how he puts that in all of these things begin to come together just perfectly right amen amen all right so let me get back I told you I was going to get back to 3113 of the church hbook he said now the Temptation will be exactly as it was in Eden it'll be a very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition to God's commanded word and yet from the standpoint of human reasoning it'll be so right so enlightening life giv to fool the world The ecumenical move that has started on what seems to be such a beautiful blessing principle uh maybe I already read that so let me just move down unless under direct denom domination uh let's see did I read that I don't know if I did go ahead now uh he says now watch he says uh he says little groups here's where I meant to pick up little groups will lose charges privileges lose property and spiritual rights with the people for example now L the local Ministerial Association approves in many if not most cities one cannot rent a building for religious services to become chap of the armed services hospitals is now almost mandatory to be recognized as acceptable to The trinitarian ecumenical groups as this pressure increases and it will it'll be harder to resist for to resist is to lose privilege and so many will be tempted to go along for they'll feel it's better to serve God publicly and I dare say a lot of yeah come on maybe weaker message believer will be called up in this cuz he says here's what they're going to well it would be better to serve God in that we'll just we'll be private Believers you know listen God ain't got no secret service department no friend you're a Frontline believer you know you just you ain't close enough to the front line then right he so they will convince themselves it's better to serve God publicly in the framework of the organization they not serve God at all yeah but they heir rightly to believe the devil's lies to serve Satan even though you may want to call him Jehovah the elect will not be deceived right right furthermore the elect will not only be kept but his move becomes image Ed the Beast the Saints will be gone in the Rapture this little delightful windome movement that started out in fellowship at Ephesus will become the monster of Satan that defiles and deceives the whole world the church system of the Roman Catholic and Protestant will in coming together will control the whole wealth of the world and force the whole world into its religious trap or will kill them by refusing them the privilege of buying and selling whereby they'd make a living right it'll be accomplished simply for the harlot's daughters all but gone back into her in the meantime Rome has acquired nearly all the the supplies of gold the Jews have the bonds and all the paper and at the right time the Harlot will destroy the present day money system by calling in all the paper and demanding gold with no gold the system fails the Jews will be trapped come into the alliance the Harlot church will go take over the world he spoke this 46 years ago and we're living right on the T I'm just trying to remind you some things tonight putting your in remembrance of things the prophet already said let me share this with you 1997 a congressman by the of Frank Wolf and 26 others introduced HR 2431 a bill that's already been passed setting up an office of religious persecution mon uh monitoring or called the orpm a national director has already been appointed by the president of the United States because this director is under the supervision of the United Nations and has no congressional oversight he's been referred to as the US religious zar the opm's edicts don't even require their approval of the president as as HR 2431 gives the orpm authority to declare sanctions and coordinate their implementation with lesser State departments I'd like to share with you some of the provisions set forth in this bill that's already passed and is a law brother B said remember now it's just a law that holds it down exactly number one they are to study Rank and evaluate all religions number two approve or disapprove licenses for all ministers I say we will not pass this test number three establish national standards for acceptable religious practices number four bring penalties against churches that won't comply number five forbid Financial contributions to churches not approved number six seize bank accounts and property of those not approved number seven monitor newspapers TV radio mail and internet for violation of hate laws number eight Target spiritually defective individuals who refuse their Unity oh yeah yeah we're spiritually defective all right by whose measuring right theirs not our number nine work with the government law enforcement agencies to see that religious unity laws are enforced and all and that all churches and religious organizations are registered with the orpm I want you to understand brother sister that these laws are already in effect and await the right time and right season before we're going to feel their effect again can I read to you only a law holds that down let me read to you very briefly now an article I'm going going to take just another minute if it' be okay an article I ran across a while back you can still find it on the Internet it's still there and it's entitled Bill Clinton signs Bill to persecute Born Again Christians American president Bill Clint course this is back I never could understand why a man who had so sullied and desecrated the highest office in the land the overal office they turn around American people were so duped into voting this this guy back in a second time and I wondered why I wondered why I wonder why well listen God's going to have a man in there that he needs to do he's the one that signed it in 1995 95 or 96 which was his second term he had to be in there and sign it cuz George Bush has probably had a little bit more God than what this man did if he got any at all they all claim to have a little bit of God so he had to sign it and he did sign it it will impose he he he has signed into law a bill which will impose economic measures or sanctions against any religious group which will refuse to unite with the rest of the religions of the world the bill called International Religious Freedom Act has been signed into law with reference number 2431 the bill which has now become law will approve or disapprove licenses for pastors priests teachers evangelist also bring sanctions against individuals churches and religious organizations that do not comply with federal guidelines particularly noteworthy is that under this law punishment has been stated for individuals or groups who could commit hate crimes by asserting that their religions their scripture or their deity is exclusive or Superior to others oh Lord we might we might just throw our hands up now we might just throw our hands up now you ain't going to talk your way out of this am uh such statements as I am the Lord and there's no one above me oh if you want to quote that if it's found in the scripture of any religion it becomes illegal and attracts imprisonment to members of such a group oh Pastor priest or official of such religion will have their licenses withdrawn so that it becomes altogether illegal for them to discuss their religious convictions with anyone this development is brought into a climax brought to a climax a series of underground Arrangements a series of underground Arrangements a you didn't read this in USA Today you didn't catch this in the Washington Post of the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal you didn't catch it on CNN or MSNBC or Fox News you didn't catch it but a series of underground let me read underground arrangements to unite all the religions in the world into one and to punish severely all those who will oppose such a move for about two decades now the churches have worked on a hidden agenda to unite all the churches under the pope and to use the pope as a central figure to unite all the religions into into into into one the program of unification has been substantially achieved through the World Council of churches and he this guy don't even know who brother Ram is right right brother Ram told us 45 years ago the same thing I'm reading tonight amen right the program is now filtered into various denominations which are at the moment working out several grounds of cooperation and subsequently unification yeah attracts imprisonment to members of such a group yeah you know what I thought when I read that where when I read that phrase right there brother bam in the message Blasphemous names he said This Woman This Woman her power talking about the sixth Vision World counsel and you see right now where they're going to take all the people that's got Odd Ideas about religion and send them to Alaska huh I got some ideas ideas about religion yeah now not according to you but according to the Baptist the Pentecostal the me whatever they're odd little ideas they'll tell you that they odd oh you're odd you got Odd Ideas well to you they're odd but not to God he says you see right now they all going to take all people got ideas about religion and send them to Alaska he said you've all seen that all of our odd beliefs what is it the council the World Council of churches yeah y well that sounds cruel in heart doesn't it absolutely how about influence Jeffers 196 he says I understand that everybody that won't agree and come into the international agreement of this Fellowship that they're trying to form and unite all the churches together the Federation of churches that all that won't come in Unite with it they're making them a little Province they're going to send them to Alaska you might as well get ready for cold weather cuz it looks like it's coming how did I miss this now I like cold weather but I don't like Alaska cold hon that's right you know and you know you know we're just you can't take this you and let me say it like this well is it going to happen to everybody this that that you know I don't know is your statement just place it where where you think maybe maybe not I don't know I mean maybe you can hide you know I don't know I don't know I'm just throwing it out there see I don't know we all going to be swept up shipped off to Alaska but the prophet's looking at something see what I'm saying right I was on the internet and I found a little something you can find this on apfn dog I found this article that said this over 800 prison camps are found here in the United States or over 800 prison camps in United States all fully operational and ready to receive prisoners they're all staffed and even surrounded by full-time guards but they're all empty the camps all have railroad facilities as well as roads leading to and from the detention facilities many also have an airport nearby the majority of the camps can house a population of 20,000 prisoners currently the largest of these largest of these facilities is just outside Fairbanks Alaska what did the prophet see 40 years ago it wasn't there 40 years ago just outside Fairbanks Alaskan Alaskan facility is a massive mental health facility right we're just crazy a mental health facility that can hold approximately 2 million people big church it might not be too long brother sister be a big church might not be long before you know these messy churches start getting these you know these long brown official looking envelopes from the federal government stating rules that we've got to abide by in order to remain a church the motive that the American government is giving for the establishing of such an organization is this to guarantee every American the freedom for dangerous and radical religious sexs and Cults yeah and they think we apply I got a question what Mainline denomination Church system wouldn't be for the enforcing of such a bill right sure it's natural they want to be protected from those who would repeat the tragedy of Waco David KES the failing gong suicides 136 of them in China 1999 how about the gy uh in 19 the Jim Jones suicides in Guyana back in the 70s listen let we we wouldn't harm anybody but we're going to be classified as such telling you brother sister I'm going to let the musicians come it's decision time making in the message churches cuz soon there's going to be a separation of people who have called themselves message Believers right but it's only going to be those true One in a Million that true elected Gene seat of God and take a stand and refuse the fellowship card of the World Church and those without this Rapture and faith will be offered temptations that they will absolutely not be able to resist right amen they'll absolutely give in brother said on page 265 the church book it is in this age that the churches are going to come together right and as they are even now controlling World politics they will soon control the finances of the world that's right then if you don't belong to the world organization of churches you won't be able to by S you'll lose all those who stay true to God and keep their garments clean from the defilement of this world system of church orders will be physically B stripped of everything there will be presented to them a great temptation to give in Preachers will give in with the excuse that they will serve God within the framework of the Antichrist Beast system they will give into the flatteries and the blandishments of the hierarchy and the people will follow these false sheer right into the slaughter but in the Judgment they'll be found naked they'll not be given those white robes neither will they walk with him you cannot walk in the spotted garments of the world holding hands with the devil and then expect to be with God it's time to wake up and hear the voice of Christ come out of her my people be not partakers of her sins God is speaking sh the religions of the world like you sh the plague leave off walking with the world and make your garments WIP by repentance and the blood of Christ do it now before it too late glory amen the prophet of God is teaching us friend that the squeeze and the full manifestation of the third pull of the mark of the beast are all to happen right here in the same season to compromise this message in that hour and to receive the world Fellowship card is to take the mark no neutral ground amen will you have to be in rout page 274 he said it's Israel who was the chosen of God majority forfeited their rights in the Book of Life by rejecting Jesus so the majority of the Gentile church will come into condemnation with the resultant removal of their names from The Book of Life by rejecting the word and entering into this world ecumenical movement which is the image of the Beast what a deceitful time what a deadly time the denominal church has to come into without realizing what's happened to them they'll go right into that thing have their removed names removed from The Book of Life they they hadn't already been removed right they'll join forces with the government they'll persecute the bride of Christ and any man for their sin they'll be cast into the Lake of Fire right right but God has a word and I'm going to close with this do not fear Little Flock 355 Church the age is fast closing if do tear be bound together as a three-fold cord not easily broken they'll have a tremendous threefold strength of political physical and spiritual satanical power they will seek to destroy the bride of Christ she will suffer but she will endure can you say praise the Lord are those things coming upon there for he who loved his own love loveth them unto the End Amen
