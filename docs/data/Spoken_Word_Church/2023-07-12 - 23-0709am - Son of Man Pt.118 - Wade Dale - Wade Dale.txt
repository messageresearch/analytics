very much I appreciate that we're trying we're getting all the rooms uh situated um we will be paying for your room uh but not for your meals now the only meal you're really going to have because the motel that you're staying in has continental breakfast so you can have your break for Saturday morning and Sunday morning at the motel uh Friday night there will be sandwiches it'll be light meal but we're gonna have a lot of fellowship at that Park and you got all this if you need it get it in the back the itinerary Saturday will start at 10 o'clock and then we have a church service at six there'll be a meal provided while we're at we're going to become methodists for a day at the United Methodist Church I hope they don't have a problem while we're there and split up but um then we're gonna have church service six o'clock brother Joel Brown will be the speaker and then afterwards if there's anything left over we'll eat it if not we'll go get something to eat because it'll be right there in Irwin not too far all right Sunday morning church service will be at the Erwin Full Gospel Tabernacle which is brother Andre heads Church uh here is the address now after the service those of y'all that's going to the farmer's daughter listen to me carefully they do not take credit cards they do not take debit cards it is cash or check only all right the meal is the meal is twenty dollars each plus tax plus tip all right so it's going to be right about thirty dollars because you're all going to tip twenty percent all right that's what I thought so anyway so that'd be twenty four dollars and then four more dollars for tax so figure up about thirty dollars for the meal so the meal is going to be 30 bucks a piece and you'll be required to you know you're paying that so uh just keep that in mind we've got a place for 50 people and they're going to feed us there it's a buffet kind of style thing they bringing stuff in bulging kind of eat what you want to and it's really good home cook owned by an Amish so we've ate there many many times before and some of you that spit up there you you eat there too so we sure do uh appreciate brother Andre and them getting the group

Tennessee which is not very far everything's kind of there together so let's just y'all keep us in prayer that are not going we'll keep you in prayer that are staying here uh we've been wanting to get together with them for a long time haven't seen Brother Richard Wilson in them in a while well me and June have but a lot of y'all haven't and um we went out and had breakfast with him one time a couple of couple months ago and um then all the other ones we haven't seen in probably 30 years so it's going to be a real good homecoming for a lot of us that used to go up there when we were kids

not many they only have you know 25 or so people that go the whole church so uh so we're going to help them out by serving and cleaning up and all that so just remember that just just pray that everything goes well pray that brother Dale was able to come because they really want to see him he's he's uh he's important he's important to all them up there too I mean he's his ministry helped them weigh years and years and years ago before anything before you know before we were a big church here they were they were probably a bigger bigger Church in Tennessee when brother would be in them was Aaron and Dad brother would be were good friends and then him and brother Richard Wilson good friends and they've learned a lot from each other and and we glean that as as the congregation we glean from that when brother down ministers that that they had all that support and all they they could talk and fellowship back in the late 70s early 80s and into the 90s brother calling them used to go brother dardy used to go to ministers meetings up there um every month they'd have a ministers meeting either they are here so we really appreciate them let's stand to our feet let's get into the service just remember all these announcements if you need that itineraries right back there on the right sitting on that shelf and if you're if if you're if you're uh if your itinerary changes you need to let us know because we got a block of rooms and I don't want to have pay for a room because the church is paying for all the rooms so um I don't want to room to set empty if we don't need it and she's already called wanting us to to get some king-size Beds which will be for the couples which is fine don't worry we already got that taken care of but she's wanting to readjust because we took up 15 double double bed room so she was needing a few double beds so anyway we're going to work that out we'll have plenty of room for everybody to stay Friday night and Saturday night we know a lot of you are coming Saturday uh if you are coming Saturday let me please try to get there you know at least buy it for the service time all right at six o'clock I know it's gonna be tough for some brother Louise and then we're going to be a little bit late but at least we're gonna get together we'll be there and then everybody will be there on Sunday and we should have a good time in the Lord amen I love Fellowship I'm a sheep I need her I'm a herd animal I need people around me I ain't no loner I like people and uh and uh we pray that after I get finished with this what I'm fixing to say today I hope you like me too because we're going to talk about brotherly kindness but we're going to get into some eye openers all right but that's what we need now listen before we go we're not going any further without brotherly kindness we're not going any further we're not going we can talk headstone you can talk Seven Seals you can talk bringing Christ back to the Earth you can talk about Rapture you can talk about Resurrection but if you don't have brotherly kindness ain't gonna happen are you going to go by the grave one of the two all right so let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord thank you for all these things you've given us you give us an opportunity to have a a congregation that's that's big enough Lord so that we can go do things and help other small churches and fellowship with them where maybe they can't fellowship with anyone else that we can come in and fellowship with them and and fellowship around you there'll be a lot of of um a fellowship of getting back together of of back when and all that but Lord I pray that you be the center of everything that we do you be the one and that's the only reason we're Gathering because we're gathering around this message and we're gathering around another group of people another group of family members brothers and sisters in the Lord Jesus now we pray that you be with them up there be with those sisters and brothers brother Andre too as they prepare and get the food ready and and get all the things together we know what a task that is Lord from doing things here we appreciate the people here too Lord that helped last weekend and the different ones that help all the time um doing things getting stuff ready because we want to be servants we want to serve the people we want the people to feel comfortable the only person we want uncomfortable today is the devil and Lord I pray that through the preaching of your word that we'll hear from you Lord give us the eye salve Lord to put on our eyes and Lord give us ears to hear father I pray this should bless us be with the ones that are sick be brother Dale sister Dale different ones lord it's not here today that so desires to be set in this congregation again Lord I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus that your healing power will go to each one and give them strength to get back in Church Father we pray that you should be with us Lord further in this service in Jesus name amen in the beginning was the word where it was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and Truth Philippians 2 verse 3 says let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in lowliness of Mind Let each esteem other that's hard to do I'm just going to tell you up front hard to do because of all the selfishness that we have but in the lowliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves you may be seated in the Lord has blessing because remember what did Abraham do even without the without the baptism of the Holy Ghost Abraham had an ending from the Old Testament and even under Ting he said okay lot we're standing here together we're looking at the planes of mammary which is green as as all get out and there's Sodom and Gomorrah you've already got two cities over there and then over here is the desert Abraham bless God I'm in the message I know the prophet that's mine you can take what's left over know what Abram what Abram Abraham do he said light whichever one you want lot took that one Abraham Abraham said not a problem I'll take this one but now who did God bless blessed Abraham all right he'll take he'll take something that we think sometimes is a curse and make a blessing out of it all right good to have brother George back with us her his sister passed away last week suddenly and we sure were praying for you and appreciate the phone call anything we can do you know you let us know but good to have him back with us today second Peter 1 says besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and diverse your knowledge and knowledge Temperance Temperance patience to patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity so all these are ads we're adding these to our Christian experience it says what after in other words besides this what besides your new birth we're going to get into this when we get to the to the part where it says holy spirit because when it seals you in like that you come under an anointing called adoption or this is where your adoption or your placing is that is not your new birth you can be born again and not be adopted but you can't get be adopted and not be born again all right just like we were talking about being saved you can be saved and not be born again all right but you can't be born again and not have come to Salvation thereby with me on that all right so we are looking at now an ad to we're looking at an addition to your Christian Journey this is what we need to do to become what brother ramps calls us a Powerhouse we want to be a Powerhouse we don't want to come to just church today I didn't just come to church today to get a to get a firecracker I come for TNT I come for dunamis which is where you get the word Dynamite from I want to come with that today and get that and take it with me and blow the devil up with it all right we get so happy sometimes with the Devil well I'm going to preach anyway all right well if y'all don't just pray for me all right Colossians 1 verse 26 says though there's a mystery that mystery in the end time is what Christ in you the hope of glory and the fullness of the son of man and a group of people not in one in a group of people that takes this message and makes it come alive as Christ was alive back in 2000 years ago that's my goal is to see every one of us you me included be something that God can use we have been used by the devil long enough amen I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired I'm sick and tired of the devil taking over and having his way yeah all right but what do we do we need to get in the word you don't have to go you don't have to go do Hail Mary's and you know don't know just get back in the word of God which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man teaching every man all wisdom that we may present every man perfect our complete in Christ that's what we're heading for amen and then we talked about the I'm trying to background for some that weren't here last week there was a holy spirit Veil put on Adam and Eve all right they had a holy ghost Veil on their eyes that they were naked and didn't know it all right but they were not perverted am I just preaching to myself today can somebody either nod a little louder or say Amen okay there was a holy spirit Veil over them for their nakedness now the Holy Spirit brother rounds was over their eyes they seen nothing but their brother and sister see all right the laws they didn't know they were naked they had the Holy Spirit Veil they didn't they didn't um uh they didn't worry about that what we have to worry about putting on clothes all right they didn't have to worry about that but now brother Brown said the spirit of unholeness uncleanness and lust has veiled this scientific age and Revelation 3 tells us that they're naked and don't know it amen but in a lustful way not in the way God wants it to be because even now we're we've come to a place to where we're going to have white robes we're not going to walk naked in the in the future home we're going to have white robes on all right brother around salmon white robes right right so brother uh this is my quote we we're putting the veil back on by the reveal word God has given us a veil to where we don't we don't do this I mean sometimes we shockingly do that for what they don't have on or whatever more but it's not it's not a lust Bale that we're under I hope I hope we kind of got away from that a little bit all right it's always but veil was being put back on by the word of God and by these virtues the word of God Is veiling Us from the outside but unveiling God inside of us amen all right brother Brown preach the unveiling of God now where was he unveiling God at thing and people that's right that's right not in a church not in a message not in a a car or or whatever you want to say or a tape recorder it was in the people he knew there'd be a people and the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound now if the mystery is going to be finished or the mystery is going to be known it's got to be known to you yes it's got to be known to a human being all right it can't be known to the animals they didn't fall right they felt because we fell now we're trying to get us back so that they can come back and they won't be eating each other and they won't be a food chain in the in the uh in the out in the woods where one eats the other one and this one eats that one but you know what we're going to do we're going to do the same thing because you know what I'm gonna read you here in just a minute all that Spirit of selfishness and critical spirit it makes you eat people and you could eat up with it yeah brother Branham gotta eat up with it that ought to wake you up I'm gonna read you a quote he even said he had a critical spirit I've been reading the one where he said he had a selfish Spirit brother Branham well what are you trying to say he was human and he made human mistakes but when God anointed his lips to talk to me and you that was God Almighty talking to us amen Genesis 1 26 says let us make man in our image and after our likeness so what did God do he took this as brother Ryan is talking about love he took this agape love because that's what God is he's agape love he is not filial love he allowed feel your love to come into being because of me and you because of the Fall he said okay husband you'll love your wife before all that it was Agape it was perfect love all right that's Genesis 1 26 man is agape love not filio love you didn't come here yeah you came here with filial love or the other ones on down a little bit further but by the new birth it put the agape love back inside of you are inside of you by the new birth you became born in another image amen amen everybody with me all right if you're not been born in another image you need to look at yourself if you look at yourself and see yourself different you have been born in another image but if you look at yourself and say I still do the same things I used to do you need to get born again you need the new birth let us make man in our image so if we were made in the image of God God's agape love all right so we were made in agape love God brought a family into being to Agape Love All right we have to bring family in being by feel your love are all the other ones down through the line lust and all that other stuff but God doesn't do that he allows that to happen to get you here because in Genesis 3 he said I'll put enmity in other words I got to divide this up I can't stand to see sin anymore I got to have a blood covering and that blood covering covered Adam and Eve and then it covered all the way down through all right even would have covered Cain today all right so God created a man his own image so God is there in stone it can't be changed now we can come down here on the other side of the fall and this brother around him talks in the Masterpiece and we'll read it just a second but in the image of God creating him male and female created to them so he set up brothers and sisters us brothers and sisters all right but children of God is what come forth from God agape love remember brother Ryan went across the curtain of time what do you tell what do people they said he said what is this he said the angel said oh this is perfect what perfect love that's agape love that over there is not filial love he can hook the sisters they could say my precious brother and put their arm around him and nobody be no feeling he said all right so that was what we came from praise the Lord and that's what we're going back to amen but we gotta have part of it right here because if you've got that Genesis 1 26 man inside of you you have Agape Love Inside that's the war the war if you break the war down it's the two loves agape love which is the love of Jesus Christ which is your new birth it is perfect and then you got you right that was born in the other one that's the two ones that are fighting each other all right and listen if you don't have the new birth there's no fight you just you just feel your love that's it I love this I love that you know I love this now the love of God as I said before the love of God sometimes is strange it feels strange to us because the world wants to see that Jesus was the prince of peace right he said I'm the Prince of Peace he had a pretty tumultuous life he got mad angry uh he called the religious world the devil snakes vipers father the devil right and I don't think he said it real calmly under his breath why he got a little frustrated because he was a human man but inside of him though was the agape love because that's what took him to Calvary feeling your love will not take you to Calvary agape love is the only thing that will take you to your Calvary because we all got to be right crucified with Christ is what Paul said all right so he created him in his own image but when that image came it became marred but now brother random we look at it as as oh man it's ruined it's marred not in God that's right because brother random I'm gonna read here in just a few minutes brother Brown said that stroke that marred the statue it brought out the bride as a masterpiece family the mark on the knee of the Moses statue made it special it was the stroke that cut the side of his master this his Masterpiece that brought out the bride and now we see them as a masterpiece family in the Garden of Eden how beautiful it pleased him he took a rest he said I'll rest but while he was resting and trusting his Masterpiece his enemy came in and found this Great Masterpiece and by deceit he crawls under the Garden of Eden and marred this beautiful Masterpiece he martyred it so it fell but now in the fall all hope was not lost in the fall what was the whole deal God was able to now get into man more now remember we talked about Moses David Sampson all of them had power but they didn't have character all right if Moses have been born again like brother Donnie sitting here he would have not killed in an Egyptian he would have not done the things he did all right but he had power from God because he was chosen to do with the anointing and we're going to get into that maybe in a couple of sermons and probably do it at brother Andres is talk about anointed for the time there's an anointing for the time now listen a new birth is not an anointing right the new birth is your birth it's a person it's something that sticks to you praise God and it's Eternal but now you can have an anointing that's not eternal knowing it was a ten times you can people can be anointed to write songs people in this message anointed to write songs and be laying in the bed of adultery during what time they're doing it yeah that's power without character because they yield their self to what an anointing they yield their self the world Listen today you're Anointed with something yes you're either anointed to preach you're anointing to listen you're anointed to be a deacon you're anointed to be a wonderful wife or a husband that's an anointing that see that comes uh regardless of your new birth brother John didn't become a husband now it might become a good one when he got born again but sister Alicia's no don't don't shake your head neither neither way just leave it at that no he was a good husband I'm sure but but now that he's born again he's a wonderful husband see what I'm talking about so you always have that anointing of what you were remember brother Ryan said remember you're born a prophet but now remember that you got to be careful because brother Branham remember he had to be born again he wasn't he didn't say that that anointing Birch you yeah it just anointed you right brother Branham had the new birth now we can agree everybody in this building brother Brandon was born again amen right but why did he stand in the pulpit and he said I'm waiting on him waiting on who I thought he had the who inside of him yeah he was waiting on a special anointing he was waiting on his Malachi 4 Revelations 10 7. he was waiting on that anointing to come behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet will God sent him but he had to anoint him to do the things he did all right because you and I have the same New Birth that that brother Brown had or God's different amen he's not different but he comes with different anointings at different levels Jesus stood one day opened the book and he said in other words I've been anointed look on the River Jordan I'm preaching my sermon for next Sunday luck on the River Jordan now he didn't need the Holy Ghost everybody with me he didn't need the Holy Ghost he was God he was the Holy Ghost whatever that spirit inside of him was not the spirit of immortal man that's right or a normal human being amen so what came on him at the River Jordan he didn't get the Holy Ghost like me and you get it he got an anointing to send him forward into his ministry all right because you proved that in the Book of Luke he said I've been anointed to preach the gospel to bring good tidy and remember he stopped why'd he stop that wasn't time for that anointing the time for the anointing is over here now when he's going to destroy the world and he wasn't going to judge the world Amen so anyway so that's kind of where if you look at that anointing you can see even even these are anointing because it's not your birth your birth is down here then you add to you're anointed to these different things and I'll prove to you a little bit because I want to read a couple of quotes I know we got started late I won't do very much this morning but we'll get to it this afternoon but Moses had power without character David look at David a man after God's Own heart listen a man that that God said my heart beats with David's heart that's what he said yeah a man after my own heart now we're going to look at David and call him a murderer a liar an adulterer premeditated murder he would have got a life sentence or either he'd got electrocuted if he'd been in this and have been in the end time because he premeditated that it wasn't just he got mad and struck him no he mapped the whole thing out and brought his best General besides Uriah and said uh withdraw him you know withdrawal leave him out there well that man knew too but he wasn't going to go against the king that wasn't a new birth no Samson Abraham Jacob Noah Saul Elisha all these different ones they had flaws but now we we all right now they had flaws right we're not putting them down because watch this the first Corinthians 10 verse once is moreover president I would not that you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud now this is Paul talking about the Jews in the wilderness everybody with me all right I feel like I'm preaching to nobody today all right so somebody either say man or amen amen I'm gonna preach it anyway I'm gonna preach till 11 45 so y'all just sit there and pay attention or just sit there was in the cloud in the sea and he'd all eats the same spiritual meat in other words they weren't Gentiles they weren't worldly people right they were in the message of the hour let's say Amen they were following the message of the hour they were following the prophet of the hour they were following the anointing of the hours and did all drink the same spiritual drink for the drink of the rock that followed him and that rock was Christ kind of a strange rock you know you get up in the morning the Rocks there you go two or three miles you get up the next morning The Rock's there flowing with water uh watering two million people yeah and horses and camels and all that other stuff all right but with many of them God God is not well pleased how about that today for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples so Moses is our example Abraham how many sermons have you heard Moses name mentioned how many sermons have you heard Abraham boy now Abraham what if you took all them out of the Bible took them all out Noah oh that was a flood I don't know how anybody got across yeah we do no it did because God anointing Noah to build an ark so these things are our example to the intent we should not lust after those evil things they lusted after in other words I don't want to paraphrase but that's kind of what he was saying as they also lusted all right neither be ye idolaters as were some of them matters written the people sat down to eat and drink and Rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day 23 000 people got killed in one day out of the children of Israel because they committed fornication neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed by serpents neither murmur you amen murmur try that sometime quit murmuring as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the Destroyer now all these things happened unto them for in Sample are examples and they were written for our admonition in other words so we can preach brother John we can teach about these people and say look we know David was a man after God's Own Heart he wrote the Psalms and he wrote these different things and and God loved him but he had a flaw but to flaw to me made the masterpiece that's what me and somebody else were talking the other day now David great David right everybody with me David great David David God thought so much to David he said your throne is going to be forever somebody is going to sit on your throne he said I'm gonna sit on your throne as the son of David through the Millennium that's how much I think of you David right right now what was David's daddy's name Jesse right he comes and he tells Samuel here's all my kids you know this and and got you know got them lined up Samuel says None of these what I can't get the anointing to fall on none of these right he walks up to one not sure but he walks up to the eldest Samuel's standing there with the anointing on him to anoint a king all right nothing happens come on what some of y'all doing now nothing's happening so you go to number two go to number three nothing four five six wow something's going on God sent me here right here I'm a prophet of God God sent me here he said going on a king go to Jesse's house and anoint a king so he takes the oil doesn't ring out doesn't ring a bell he says is there something going on what's my whole point we talk about David we talk about his brothers we talk about his daddy Jesse but David had a mama David had a mama that you'll never know until we get on the other side who she is but she was very intrical because David remember was the baby he was mama's boy and his mama taught him well he said oh no no no well wait a minute let's go with Jacob look at all the mothers in the Bible that have helped their kids but you never heard of David's Mama what are you trying to say you your man your name may never be called from the pulpit your name may never be called in the Bible or in a sermon but I promise you you are worth something you all have an anointing for a job that you do whether you just raise kids whether you teach Sunday school whether you whether you go and work and and Shine Your Light somewhere amen amen but you never heard of her but she had to be an integral part she kept those kids together and she made a house good enough to where God sent Samuel the prophet to that house to anoint a king he just didn't know it was David he thought you know the big tall one the eldest no it was a little boy that was out in the field watching sheep but they were given for example so now that's that's an example for us that we as Christians and we talk about brotherly kindness listen brotherly slash sisterly kindness they ain't just on the brothers we sisters we sisters I'm talking about we sisters need to do it too well that wasn't funny at least you laughed amen and laugh let's see if we can get those two together so example or example means a pattern look watch this what did we just talk about the stroke that marred the Masterpiece right that word example means a stroke or a blow to all these were struck somehow in their life for me and you listen we will always have these great ones in the Old Testament we will always have their name called because they're going to be the pillars over there of that new city remember 12 Patriarchs 12 Apostles right not gonna forget them they're gonna be there the tribes all the 12 tribes you know what they're named after people right right that's right a figure formed by a blow or an impression in other words Abraham made an impression on us because we talk about him giving his life his wife away twice laughing at God David killing his best friend Jacob Jacob just he if he went to to Las Vegas he'd be the biggest gamble there was because he deceived everything and everybody that he touched or came into contact with all right until he came in contact with God he spent one night with God and he wrestled with him maybe we ought to do that sometime and wrestle with God and walk different because remember God struck him on the fire and he became a limping Prince well now his name's changed to Israel and everybody knew that there was something different about Jacob well that's the same way about your new birth do you walk different than what you did before right the teaching which embodies the sum and substance of religion and represents it to the Mind manner of writing and content form of letter in other words we look back at the Old Testament to see these examples all right which is I'm getting to something here because Jesus stood one day and he said I give you a new commandment right I I you know don't do away with that remember he he became the law he came under the law he made it Honorable in other words he made it where we could live it that's right because they couldn't live it in the Old Testament they didn't they didn't have anything to leave it with because they would have an anointing that would anoint Moses to where you couldn't even look at him his face shines so much with God God's presence and then he could go kill an Egyptian and and strike the rock instead of speaking to it disobeying God right it's a pattern of warning of ruinous events which serve as admonitions or warning to others that's what we look back to but Jesus stood and he or things prefigured the future of Messianic person which is Jesus Christ he's standing there saying a new commandment he said you're living the best you can what did he tell the Rich Young Ruler the Rich Young Ruler said I've lived all 10. did you not say that I've lived all Ten Commandments from my youth you can't condemn me of not living the Ten Commandments Jesus said okay you gotta do one more thing so that's right you gotta sell all and become me he didn't say enough shall all and become your neighbor come up somebody sell all and go back to your daddy now he had a daddy Mama too he said sell all take up your cross and follow me what cross did that come from it come from that yes that was a cross-ship that Jesus bought anybody with me on that think about that he was telling the Rich Young Ruler hey you got to be me yes you've done all this that law is good that's letter you passed the letter test but if you pass the spiritual test have you passed the virtue test remember he didn't uh he knew the message in about every quote come on the Commandments right right don't do this do that wear your dress is long don't cut your hair come to church but he never became he couldn't go that far he was selfish that's what we're gonna get into because brotherly kindness you have to do away with selfishness all right so let's read this real quick besides just giving all diligence add to your faith virtue diverse your knowledge and all his Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness godliness brotherly kindness and your brother kindless charity now remember brotherly kindness or let's say brotherly sisterly charity or or kindness comes from the word Philadelphia which is two words and we'll read it in a minute but it literally means to love your brother all right love with the brothers or sisters in the New Testament look he didn't say any old there was no love there was no agape love now listen God would come down as Jehovah and would anoint people because of agape love but he couldn't put that agape love inside of the people in the Old Testament because he hadn't come and released a life yet all right which Christians cherish for each other as brethren now remember that we were talking about this last Sunday there's an inward work of virtue knowledge Temperance and patience that's something you got to do an upward of being more like God and then your outward appearance is your brotherly kindness and love you can hide a lot of things but I'll promise you I'm fixing to read something here in just a minute and I hope I want the cameras turned on your face I'm warning you oh now y'all gonna be good but what about inside don't be like Jesus said Dead Man's bone I'll be hitting I your anger your faith face will betray you right all right all right so this is the compound word involving philio which is love and Adolphus which his brother literally means the love of the brother now listen to brother Bradham it comes from agape love to feel your love to lust down this way now what happened was Jesus came and plopped himself down here in this earth and worked his way back the other way with us with it that's right right he came here with us and him amen and he went back to heaven with us and him but he didn't keep it he came back onto that Pentecost set it back down the love of God he sent it back to 120 and put it in them and that's what he's been doing since 2000 years ago all right he's been putting agape love back into his children and as we said before remember when you say God bless you brother you are denoting that that person is in your family you're connected by family that's my brother that's my sister all right do we really mean that um all right brother I'm talking about putting yourself in this place I gotta hurry around here to get to this have patience with him now watch this right here everybody ready for this so hanging around down there and the first thing you know one night came up a question about church so you always get in trouble and about Christians one of the old drunks sitting there said there ain't no such thing as Christians anymore said there's no such a thing all this bunch of Hypocrites now this is questions and answers 1964. all this bunch of Hypocrites said you see them out here smoking drinking doing the same things that we do and we see that today and said call themselves Christians there's no such this one drunk raised up and said just a minute there's one that I know about then who is it says my wife are y'all ready for this says she's become salty he was catching it all the time he said I bet if she was put to a squeeze we're gonna be put to a squeeze right remember we're the wife of Jesus Christ right he said no she's still a Christian I'll prove it to you and I know what most of your sisters are going to when I get finished reading this paragraph you're going to say scoundrel kick him out of the house and I'll divorce him I don't see it in your face already because some of you know this story did I tell you what Let's do let's go up home and I'll show you whether she's a Christian or not said let's go up home and now let's really be drunk in other words we're going to pretend like we're really drunk knocked at the door came in staggering over everything more right there y'all already mad stumbling over everything why don't you sit around this way and everything and she set them all in the chair and somebody's wife uh uh his guest you know and tried to make them just as welcome as could be could be pretending they were drunk how many of us would already kicked them out tried to make them as comfortable and welcome as could be said I want you to fix us some supper all right y'all just hold your temper down all right um bless God go fix it yourself you're drunk go fix it yourself you done fell over the chair knocked over the uh flower pot do it yourself I'm reading what brother random tells us okay I'm just telling you these are for our example right right I want you to fix us some supper and so they she went out and fixed some said we want ham and eggs he knowed they had it so they fixed the ham and eggs she did when he got there at the table he looked at him like that picked up his plate easy sisters and slam the stuff on the floor and said you know I don't like my eggs like that I can feel it already come on boys let's get out of here anyway like that they went out and said I don't sound like that you know she didn't go back in the bedroom and start pouting hello somebody she didn't take her emotions and let him override and she go sit in the closet and cry her eyes out she might have been crying but she came outside and said what can I do I'm sorry I didn't I I didn't get them fixed I'll fix more for you knocks a lot of us out right there doesn't it yeah I see you waldoes oh nonsense you know I didn't want him that way in the first place now he's still owner just carrying on like that they went out there and sat down and acted like they was drunk they heard her in there kind of snubbing to herself singing real low must Jesus bath the cross alone and all the world go free no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross from me this consecrated cross-all bear Till Death Shall Set Me Free one drunk looked at the other one said she's a Christian she's got it and that little woman led her husband plus these others to Christ that night say why see just be real sweet you believe that story I mean brother around me is a liar if that's not a story that he told that he knew somebody had told him about right he may not have been part of it but he sure he's a wonderful Storyteller and he weaves it into his sermon she's a Christian and that little woman led her husband plus these others to Christ that night she didn't have to cut but she didn't have to call Pastor she didn't have to call the preacher should not put on tape and they saw it in her amen how many of us could have passed that test don't raise your hand because I know none of us maybe one or two John 13 34. listen that's an example of a Christian you can say well that's far-faction you're using a telling you what the prophet said if he put it in here and weaved it into a sermon guess who it's for amen what for the world hey for you yes sir I'll clap myself [Applause] enough of us to help us get out of that yes by telling us that story and saying man I have really messed up John 13 34 says a new commandment now here's Jesus standing he's he's giving him a new commandment that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another look by this shall all men know that that woman was a Christian right if you have love one for the other but this shall all men know that you are my disciples in other words an outward display if you have love one to the other remember disciples means discipline those disciples were disciplined to what Jesus said all right but it is an outward display Proverbs 25 21 it says it's not any enemy be hungry bless God he can make it for herself he's the one that made the mistake it's not what the Bible says if he be thirsty give him water to drink for Thou shalt he calls of fire on his head and the Lord shall reward you when I tell y'all last Sunday or Sunday before last you know how to stop an argument don't respond you know what creates an argument you responded listen now I have I have argued with myself a few times but I didn't get anywhere with it but now I've argued with other people and really messed up bad how many of y'all have argued when someone uh-huh and and felt better about it when you argue you always feel worse always see I told you glad we brought supper I mean lunch today y'all not gonna give me anything to eat can I have some cookies oh thank you Michael gives cookies to his people to come to his Sunday Hill class Ryan and Bob don't just saying the Lord is well pleased but give you to laugh a little bit because there's a there's a black fog in here he he will magnify the lawmaker honorable so God God in flesh took stood and said hey hey I am the Commandments but I'm gonna give you this new one living like I live it because remember the Pharisees even live the Ten Commandments but they had in their heart Mischief they had in their heart that they didn't like what was going on so God come to magnify the lawmaker honorable he did not come to do away with it because he kept telling him a new commandment I give you now remember the old commandment was and we'll close right here the old commandment was if Michael killed Terence I went after Michael and I was I was totally under the law of the levitical law to kill him I mean murder him take him out and cut his head off and God did not hold that against me in the Old Testament all right eye for an eye two for a tooth life for a life and now right all right if you caught with caught in the active adulterer you were putting you were you were killed the person you and the person uh there was one instance where that they brought an idol in and remember God brought the man and the woman in a tent and whoever it was Phineas or one of them took a sword and stuck it through both of them and killed them both they were honorable to do that that's right but Jesus if he come to magnify the law now he's telling us we can kill people without touching them let your communication be yay nay nay for whatsoever is more than these comments of evil you have heard that it's been said an eye for an eye or tooth for a tooth but I say unto you I'm not doing away with that I'm just telling you why agape love will do if you put it in this law amen there was nothing that was it was filial love down here because it was down here for the people God always was agape love but there was no way he could connect them sin was so bad I was thinking yesterday even being Christians and being as much godliness as we are we're dying as much holy as much as you know we come to church and and you see people like that in different ones in the 80s and that's just a sin curse there's nothing you can do about it there is but I'm telling you when brother Brown told Bill Dahl he said I'll see you again I'll shake your hand at the Tabernacle or wherever it was now whatever was hot wrong with Brother Bill now cancer or whatever it was yeah God took that away but it didn't make him 18. he still had a hard time probably getting out of the car yeah yeah and he shook brother around his hand like this because he was 92 right right that's how bad the sin curse is but God has given us a message that it will live it amen come on somebody that's our anointing destroy the works of Satan destroy the works of death because where did Death start in the garden but I say unto you that you resist not evil whosoever shall smite thee on the cheek give him the other one oh yeah I'll give him another one all right give him another five ain't that what we'd do if a man shall Sue thee it's a law hey if he wants your car give him a house I already failed all right all right every one of you I'll try because a lot of y'all in your heart you said I ain't gonna do that amen amen amen that's what I thought ever shall compel me to go a mile go too give him that ass from me that would borrow and turn right away you've heard it said that thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor and hate thine enemy now that's what they've heard from the priest with the Torah in the Old Testament that's what God Said to the people the Torah was the word of God to the people that's what they preached from all right uh Moses quotebook but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven I'm going to stop right there because I want you I want to ask you a question musicians come on I'll ask you a question I was thinking about this the other day brother Daniel we always tell we always tell us let's pray for our youth we need to really pray for our youth they got such a problem and the issues let's let's pray for our youth right which is okay but kids why don't you pray for your parents why don't you pray for

if as if he said you're gonna have a good day tomorrow well you know what if you die tomorrow you've had a good day if you're if you're if you have the Holy Ghost that's a good day amen but I will love the Lord that's not filial love that's agape love and that's the love that we are being taught by the word of God in the end time we're not working and worshiping under filial love we worship under the agape love of God which is the perfect love of God which makes us love our brother and sister which makes us as I did before is so you say something bad about somebody if you got the Holy Ghost guess what God's Gonna burden you so much you're going to feel like you gotta 50 ton elephant on your shoulder but praise God that he made you realize it there's a lot of people go through life that don't realize they got burdens on them and they're not children of God so he's not obligated to tell them yeah oh he's obligated tell them you're lost but I'm like brother Branham brother Brown said one time he said if I was God he said I tell you one time he said I wouldn't dare you again but thank God for grace and thank God that we're not God amen we'll get into it this afternoon we're running around talks about having a critical spirit we're criticize everything he said Lord take that away from me take that selfish spirit away from me take that critical spirit away from me and I'll read it to you but it's real profound because his critical spirit was now now for George there you know he yeah his hair is too long and you know he ain't been Church what in the world is going you know brother Brian didn't say that I'm gonna read it to you brother Brown said I was just critical in my heart that's right nobody else knew what he said but me he said but God condemned me because it was in my heart I was critical he said I'd see a woman walk by and he'd say oh God you're the Destroyer remember he did that when he was in the restaurant a woman sitting there with his arms around and he had just a mess and brother Brian was like God just wipe this whole thing off God said let me take you behind the door here for a minute uh you and I have talked together we're fixing to have a conversation it's going to be just one way right he didn't go back there and argue with God God said um let me show you your sins I'm not going to show you the woman's and the man's and the police officer and all that I'm gonna show you yours right you know what he said I'm gonna show you yours he said he said that blood would hit hit the Lord's head and said blood and splatter everywhere and God said those are your sins hitting him in the head a prophet but he was being critical he was condemning oh yeah sure we condemn things right but we shouldn't do it with a critical spirit you should do it it's like brother Ram I'll read to you this afternoon he said let God be critical well now what he what does he mean let him criticize through his word because he God is going to tell you what's true he's not gonna he's not gonna stop so but he's gonna tell you what's true and if you don't do it you're gonna die all right so that you know he just but he lays it out there but let's not be critical let's not be selfish but we'll talk about that let's get through this brotherly kindness amen and let's all be better Christians uh to each other amen you love the Lord let's hang out one more time as you dismissed [Music] I will praise you Lord and I will praise you hear this message [Music] foreign
