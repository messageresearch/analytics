[0:01] okay I guess that's
[0:04] recording it says R youc so I'm assuming
[0:06] that's
[0:08] recording all right if you uh if you
[0:10] want to turn with me to u to John
[0:13] chapter
[0:28] 15
[0:32] John chapter
[0:37] 15 we're going to we're going to talk
[0:40] about
[0:44] um about Abiding and purging time amen I
[0:49] believe that we're in an Abiding and
[0:50] purging time we either abide in Christ
[0:53] and that we'll see here in just a moment
[0:55] that if we abide in
[0:57] him he's going to we're going to he's
[1:00] we're going to be purged
[1:02] amen so let's uh let's read from
[1:04] starting from verse one CH uh uh John
[1:08] chapter 15 it says I am the True Vine
[1:11] and my father is the husband man every
[1:15] branch in me that beareth not fruit he
[1:19] taketh away and every branch that
[1:22] beareth fruit he leaves
[1:27] alone doesn't say that does it
[1:31] it says every branch that beareth fruit
[1:35] he
[1:36] what he purges it that it may bring
[1:39] forth more fruit amen so uh you know how
[1:44] a lot of people you know they say that
[1:47] well you know when you become a
[1:48] Christian it's just flowery bread of
[1:49] ease you know flowery bread of ease you
[1:51] know but it but it's not amen why
[1:54] because there's attributes in you that
[1:55] God wants to bring out out of you amen
[1:58] you're going to reflect the image of
[1:59] Christ amen some way or another if
[2:01] you're part of him amen I know brother
[2:04] Wade he's been speaking about the
[2:05] stature of the perfect man and you kind
[2:07] of can see the stature of the perfect
[2:09] man here sort of you know because these
[2:12] attributes abiding in him it's abiding
[2:15] in his word amen a lot of people
[2:17] complicate uh the the the this thing of
[2:20] abiding in Christ and him abiding in you
[2:22] but it's not anything complicated the
[2:24] more you stay in the word of God Amen
[2:26] the more you're abiding in him and the
[2:28] more that his life can flow back into
[2:31] you just like Jesus describes here uh uh
[2:34] as he gives the example of a tree so in
[2:37] verse three it says now ye are clean
[2:40] through the word which I have spoken
[2:43] unto you amen so so it's it's the
[2:48] process of sanctification you Sanctified
[2:50] through the word of God Amen if you want
[2:53] to get things rid of your life you know
[2:55] and uh uh um stay in the word I was
[2:58] listening to brother Dale it was a Bible
[3:00] study the uh couple of years ago and
[3:03] that was one of the things that he had
[3:05] that he had said on there I thought it
[3:06] was really interesting he said just feed
[3:09] on the word you know you want to get R
[3:11] rid of things of your life feed on your
[3:12] word on the word you know stay stay stay
[3:16] in uh stay in the word because why that
[3:18] word
[3:20] amen it'll change you amen you come to a
[3:23] point in your life where where uh where
[3:25] you're going to need that word amen a
[3:27] time of Temptation and that word comes
[3:29] to your mind amen then it'll help you
[3:31] amen overcome whatever you're trying to
[3:33] overcome whether it's lust or whether
[3:35] it's a uh uh uh temper or whatever it is
[3:39] amen that word will help sanctify you
[3:41] yes Lord now you are clean through the
[3:44] word which I have spoken unto you verse
[3:45] four abide in me and I in
[3:51] you now I like what it says here cuz it
[3:54] says abide in me and I in you
[3:57] period amen it's like when Jesus said
[4:00] amen you must be born again
[4:03] period amen when he told Nicodemus you
[4:05] must be born again amen so you abide in
[4:08] Christ amen and I in you that's the way
[4:11] it's got to be because later on we can't
[4:14] we'll see here we can't do nothing
[4:16] without Christ amen we there's nothing
[4:19] we can do unless he without him amen as
[4:23] the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[4:26] except it abide in the vine no no more
[4:30] can ye except ye abide in me amen so you
[4:34] take a you take a tree for example a
[4:37] tree has
[4:38] branches and if the only way that the
[4:42] branches are going to bear fruit if
[4:43] they're attached to the vine itself and
[4:46] you have to remember that that fruit is
[4:48] not for the for the is not for the
[4:51] tree that fruit is for for us to enjoy
[4:54] when I go up to an apple tree amen that
[4:57] apple tree is giv me apples so that I
[5:00] can enjoy and the fruit amen that we
[5:02] produce in our life whether it's
[5:04] godliness patience you know brotherly
[5:06] kindness these things amen it's not just
[5:08] for yourself it's not for you but it's
[5:10] for others Amen to enjoy Amen to receive
[5:13] the benefit out of those things amen the
[5:16] brotherly kindness that I have with
[5:17] brother Joe amen uh uh or that he has
[5:20] with me you know it's for each other to
[5:22] enjoy off that brotherly kindness
[5:24] amen so God commands us Amen to bear
[5:27] fruit but we've got to be attached to
[5:29] the vine
[5:32] now I believe that that in here we see
[5:36] um we see the makeb believer the
[5:39] non-believer and the True Believer here
[5:41] in these scriptures because why the make
[5:44] believer or the non-believer is the one
[5:47] that that that you see there in verse
[5:48] two where it says every branch in me
[5:50] that beareth not fruit he taketh away
[5:54] yeah so there's going to be branches
[5:56] amen there's going to be people we we're
[5:58] all made in the image of of God right
[6:01] even The Sinner out here in the street
[6:03] they're made in the image of God Amen
[6:05] but there's going to be some people in
[6:06] this life they're not going to bear
[6:08] fruit at all amen uh uh you know and
[6:11] they're just going to live life and and
[6:13] die and unfortunately you know hopefully
[6:16] somebody can be alike to them and and
[6:18] and and uh maybe they receive with the
[6:20] gospel but but not everybody's going to
[6:23] receive the Gospel amen not everybody's
[6:25] going to receive Christ amen then you
[6:27] have others amen that are
[6:29] going to try to live off the life of the
[6:32] vine trying to live off the the the life
[6:35] of the Christian the Christian Life when
[6:37] those are what brother brand call
[6:39] grafted Vine uh uh branches you know
[6:42] they may act and look like Christians
[6:44] and they may scream shout holler and
[6:46] Hallelujah and speak in tongues and all
[6:48] that but that they're not producing any
[6:50] fruit that's changing them amen to the
[6:54] stature of a perfect man and then of
[6:56] course you have the the the the real
[6:58] branches who are producing fruit amen
[7:01] which we'll we'll continue reading here
[7:03] verse five I am
[7:05] Divine ye are the
[7:08] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[7:14] him the same bringeth forth much fruit I
[7:19] like what he says he brings forth much
[7:21] fruit not just fruit but much
[7:23] fruit says for without me you can do
[7:28] nothing six if a man abide not in me he
[7:33] is cast forth as a branch and is
[7:36] withered and man gathered them and cast
[7:39] them into the fire and they are burned
[7:43] so when you cut off a a the branch off a
[7:47] tree the branch if you just leave it
[7:49] sitting around it's just going to get
[7:50] just uh just uh dry up and it's just
[7:53] going to rot and then what is it good
[7:56] for it's good for just firewood it's
[7:59] going to be burnt you
[8:01] know so but a branch that that that's
[8:05] that's thriving amen that's thriving
[8:07] that that I don't know much about
[8:09] gardening I don't know much about those
[8:11] things but um you know you can tell when
[8:16] a tree is thriving you know you can see
[8:18] that it's healthy you can see that that
[8:20] that that that that uh the the branches
[8:22] are green the everything is seems to be
[8:25] working correctly why because the life
[8:27] that's flowing out of the vine into the
[8:29] branches amen the branches is asking for
[8:32] that life amen and if you're attached to
[8:35] Jesus Christ amen the way you should be
[8:37] you should be staying in God's word amen
[8:39] that's right asking for that life amen
[8:42] that is produced amen from the word that
[8:44] that comes from the word of God so Jesus
[8:46] here constantly concentrating on on on
[8:50] on abiding in me and him being the word
[8:55] amen he is the word amen verse six if a
[8:59] man abide not in me he is cast forth as
[9:02] a branch and is withered and Men
[9:04] gathered them and cast them into the
[9:05] fire and they are burned verse 7 if ye
[9:10] abide in me now listen to this if ye
[9:12] abide in me and my words abide in
[9:17] you so I like the way he words it there
[9:20] because he says if he abide in me and he
[9:24] didn't say and I abide in you which
[9:26] which when his words are abiding in us
[9:29] he is abiding in US amen he is the word
[9:32] amen the Holy Ghost amen and my words
[9:36] abide in
[9:38] you lost of place here you abide in me
[9:40] and my words abide in you you shall ask
[9:43] what you will and it shall be done unto
[9:45] you amen amen so that that that Branch
[9:50] that's on that
[9:52] tree every season every year amen it
[9:55] wants to ask amen for that life that's
[9:57] coming out of the Vine amen they ask so
[10:00] that it could produce leaves again so it
[10:03] could produce tree uh I mean uh fruit
[10:06] again and uh uh um and it asks for that
[10:09] life and it's going to produce amen it's
[10:11] going to give it to it's going to give
[10:12] it to it because why it's attached to it
[10:15] you me and you amen as Christians amen
[10:17] we have a right to ask for these
[10:19] promises of God Amen we have a right
[10:21] Amen to ask God whatever we want amen
[10:25] because why we're attached to him amen
[10:27] amen some people some sometimes we feel
[10:29] like uh I'm not worthy to ask the Lord
[10:31] this I'm not worthy to ask the Lord that
[10:33] amen but where are his children I would
[10:36] want my daughters Amen to ask me uh
[10:39] whatever they they need amen I want them
[10:42] to ask me and if they don't ask me I'm
[10:44] not going to
[10:45] know sometimes Bella Bella is is she'll
[10:49] come up to me and then she'll say papy
[10:51] um uh you know and and and then I'm
[10:55] getting ready to listen to her and she
[10:56] says oh never
[10:58] mind
[11:00] what what were you going to tell me oh
[11:02] no never
[11:04] mind tell me if you don't tell me I will
[11:06] not know what you want and then she
[11:09] tells me and then it'll be something
[11:10] simple that I could just go and do you
[11:12] know but we won't know unless you ask
[11:15] now you have a right to ask the father
[11:17] because why you are part of that bind
[11:19] amen you're part of him amen we have we
[11:22] have a right to ask brother Joe what
[11:23] were you going to say uh how any Miss
[11:27] brother says that you got all the
[11:29] promises of God the Holy Ghost yours
[11:31] your healing yours he said even if you
[11:34] had to cut through the Methodist and
[11:36] Baptist it's mine you amen funny way he
[11:40] said cut through the M baptism oh
[11:43] yeah absolutely yes I was just thinking
[11:47] back on the verse seven mhm
[11:51] that you know I've always wonder about
[11:53] that too that if you abide in me and my
[11:55] words abide in you why it didn't say and
[11:58] I but something just I don't know I just
[12:01] thought the way we know him because God
[12:03] is his word and his word is God I mean
[12:06] the way we the only way because it's not
[12:08] based on emotion right the only way we
[12:10] can know like biblical know him is to
[12:14] read his to know his word that word so
[12:18] if my words about you that know I just
[12:20] thought about that yeah no absolutely
[12:22] because when Jesus Jesus was telling his
[12:25] disciples this and they had been already
[12:27] with him for so certain time all he had
[12:30] done to them was just spoken to him and
[12:32] then where it says uh in verse three it
[12:34] says he's telling them now ye are clean
[12:37] through the word which I have spoken
[12:39] unto you now remember all the disciples
[12:42] they went through a process of justif of
[12:44] sanc they were Sanctified you know even
[12:47] Judas was
[12:49] Sanctified but he wasn't able to he
[12:51] didn't go to the upper room Amen to
[12:52] receive the Holy Ghost amen so they were
[12:56] they were Sanctified or they were going
[12:58] through a process of sanctification by
[13:00] just listening to the word like a sister
[13:02] was saying Jesus didn't do anything uh
[13:05] uh uh great and of course they saw the
[13:08] Miracles and they saw the things that
[13:10] Jesus did but the Miracles don't save
[13:14] you miracles do not save you uh uh uh
[13:18] Miracles uh are just it points you to
[13:21] the Savior right amen it it shows proof
[13:24] that there is a savior amen not just
[13:27] that there's a Healer but of course
[13:28] there is a savior I was thinking about a
[13:31] while ago about how many people had been
[13:34] bras meetings and saw and actually
[13:37] received healing but never came to the
[13:39] message yeah I've thought about that too
[13:42] you know and and and God has to respect
[13:45] that law of faith in everybody that's
[13:48] why brother Brandon said uh was talking
[13:50] about people being healed in Beatles
[13:53] concerts things like that it's hard to
[13:55] understand it's hard to understand but I
[13:57] mean that that law of faith God has to
[14:00] respect not the fact that that the
[14:02] Beatles did anything for them but it's
[14:04] just the law of faith that they had I
[14:07] can receive anything from these Beatles
[14:08] I can receive healing people he said
[14:10] people getting up from their Wheelchairs
[14:12] and
[14:13] things uh but uh Catholic people can
[14:16] receive healing for you know by by by
[14:19] the uh faith that they have Amen in a
[14:22] statue Virgin
[14:23] Mary now I don't I can't explain that
[14:26] all and if you tell a denominational
[14:28] person that he he he he'll get I've had
[14:32] them get riled up with me you know what
[14:34] I'm saying how can that be how can that
[14:36] be but God has to honor that law of
[14:40] faith has to that's the reason have
[14:43] faith matter it you know it does matter
[14:45] but it's about faith right it's about
[14:48] faith yes verse seven M I live in New
[14:53] York on this verse this verse brought me
[14:56] through a mighty long way I go through
[14:59] um we had meetings conference and people
[15:02] didn't want to listen to what you say
[15:04] and I'll be standing up talking to her
[15:05] and have that I rememorize this verse it
[15:08] brought me through a whole trial of
[15:10] things in New York this verse was my
[15:12] lifeline amen yeah yeah that's a that's
[15:16] a that's a powerful verse amen and I
[15:20] used to read that verse those verses
[15:22] these scriptures and I would be like
[15:24] well how how in the world you know how
[15:26] can I abide in him what what is he what
[15:28] is he talking about you know how how
[15:30] does he abide in me and I but it's it's
[15:32] simple amen it's just staying in the
[15:34] word the white do that's correct and it
[15:37] makes you go through this verse when you
[15:39] what got me going seven and you want to
[15:42] go above it and below it and then you I
[15:45] had it so I had it on my desk I car it
[15:47] in my bag so I was always coming get and
[15:49] seven took me through a long thing and
[15:52] God know that I want for no I can't say
[15:57] go ahead I'm sorry
[16:00] well I did you used to walk around the
[16:02] streets in New York all the time all the
[16:04] time well I I can see how it helped
[16:08] you we going into another era we going
[16:12] into New York is bad but it's not as bad
[16:15] as people PR to be depending on what bur
[16:17] you're in right absolutely I was meaning
[16:20] the the the the the the temperature when
[16:23] in the winter time I that under control
[16:25] too you you you dress
[16:29] you put enough wear so when something
[16:31] happen you can pick it off happen go
[16:34] back we were just talking about that
[16:35] this
[16:35] morning but it's fine adj it to praise
[16:39] the
[16:41] Lord but in that scripture it doesn't
[16:44] say if ye abide in me so that's me
[16:47] abiding in him right and my word abides
[16:51] in you he didn't say he Abed you correct
[16:53] the word is him the word is him then you
[16:56] know how to ask what will if you're in
[16:59] the word that's right and it shall be
[17:01] done you that's right he didn't say a
[17:03] word about me being in you MH but then
[17:06] later on he says when he says I need to
[17:08] go so that the comforter could come amen
[17:12] and that I will be with you even in you
[17:14] amen and him amen the Holy Ghost the
[17:18] word everything is all the same amen
[17:20] that's the reason why we can see here
[17:22] say what sister Peg was saying that he
[17:24] says and my words abide in you amen you
[17:28] you can receive amen you you can hear
[17:31] this word amen and just have it in an
[17:33] intellectual conception of it that
[17:35] doesn't mean it's changing you amen it
[17:37] doesn't mean it's changing we're so bad
[17:40] even in the message still base it all on
[17:42] emotion yeah believe me sister I the
[17:46] same way when I first came into the
[17:48] message it was in 1999 when I first
[17:51] heard the message that's a that's a
[17:53] whole story maybe another time I give my
[17:55] testimony but um and I thought amen for
[17:59] like the first 2 or 3 years I thought
[18:01] that you know I saw everybody jumping
[18:03] and hollering and and saying amen and
[18:06] barely even heard the preacher preach
[18:08] amen and just and you thought that that
[18:10] was it you know cuz I came straight from
[18:12] like Baptist uh from the Baptist Church
[18:15] and this was the uh the fundamental
[18:17] Baptist Church which fundamental
[18:20] Baptists they they the women they wear
[18:22] skirts they cut their hair but they wear
[18:24] skirts and they're pretty modest people
[18:26] I used to go to Bob Jones University
[18:28] you know uh and so um
[18:33] so of course if you don't know Bob Jones
[18:35] University they have uh they go from
[18:37] kindergarten all the way to University
[18:39] if you didn't know that so but I I only
[18:41] went there in kindergarten uh Middle
[18:44] School in in high school and I was I was
[18:47] kind of bad and I got kicked out in
[18:49] ninth
[18:50] grade but of course my my my mom and my
[18:53] dad they were going to take me out
[18:54] anyways cuz it was getting kind of
[18:56] expensive but I was a bad little kid kid
[18:58] at the time but um you know and then
[19:02] from from going from Baptist to to we
[19:06] went through a little bit of Pentecost
[19:08] but not total not not a lot it was a
[19:10] shocker to us you know coming into a
[19:12] message church and You' see paintings
[19:15] you know stuff like this and you're like
[19:16] what in the world is that you know we're
[19:18] in a we're in a cult or something like
[19:20] that you know but and sometimes we
[19:22] forget those things you know to us isn't
[19:25] it's a you know it's we're we're used to
[19:27] seeing right paintings like that and and
[19:30] and the wheel of God and and things like
[19:33] that but to a Baptist person and to them
[19:35] they that scares them it scares them to
[19:38] see the Hoffman's head of Christ hanging
[19:41] on the wall you know why especially to a
[19:43] Catholic person that's just trying cuz
[19:46] they think it's
[19:48] Catholic you know so we kind of forget
[19:50] those things you know we kind of forget
[19:52] that that that I'm not saying take the
[19:54] Hoffman head of Christ to me it's a
[19:56] precious painting now you know but see
[19:58] but see to any Catholic person you know
[20:00] that wants that's coming into
[20:02] Christianity they think that that's a
[20:04] stumbling block to them so um I don't
[20:08] even know where I was going with this
[20:10] but yeah so so it's a it's a shocker and
[20:12] I thought you know I had to run and and
[20:14] a all those things and then you know
[20:16] later on I say let me just concentrate
[20:18] on the word yeah let me just listen and
[20:21] see what the preacher got to say
[20:23] whatever I can get amen and without any
[20:26] you know sensational in anything which
[20:29] is okay there's people that are
[20:30] emotional and that's fine we have all
[20:32] levels and and and some people amen some
[20:35] sometimes we're made to have emotions
[20:37] amen there's going to be people praising
[20:39] God Amen in in glory and I don't think
[20:42] they're going to be praising God with
[20:43] their hands right next to them you know
[20:45] like this you know and all quiet and
[20:47] stuff like that you know I don't think
[20:49] that and it'd be good for usen to let
[20:52] loose sometimes you know our growth
[20:54] can't be based on emotions correct all
[20:57] right you you mean our experience grow
[20:59] our growth that's that's right yeah but
[21:01] I mean well while you're walking in
[21:04] Christ amen sometimes you're going to
[21:05] have times of emotion you know why why
[21:09] person don't want emotion what I don't
[21:11] understand they want to clap down on the
[21:12] other like me why don't you want to
[21:14] rejoice in the Lord right why you want
[21:17] say like a thump on the law you know
[21:19] what I mean right no I I to know the
[21:21] truth I think there should be balance in
[21:23] those things you know sir not going to
[21:26] one extreme where can't do nothing then
[21:30] not going to The Other Extreme where you
[21:32] just you know that you can't hear the
[21:33] word going forth but I I'm just saying a
[21:35] lot of young people yeah in message
[21:38] churches they go to conventions and
[21:40] stuff and a and you know I mean you want
[21:43] them to
[21:45] hear how to be sav not just emotion you
[21:48] know math alter calls where it's just
[21:51] all emotion yeah I agree and uh that's
[21:56] really responsibility I believe you know
[21:58] the ministers who are there you know to
[22:00] take them aside and really man just like
[22:02] Paul you know Paul he stayed brother
[22:04] said he stayed with them until they
[22:06] received something you know he worked
[22:08] with them and that that's the reason why
[22:10] it's so important to have teaching amen
[22:13] because teaching teaching amen uh uh
[22:17] affirms you you know it sets the thing
[22:21] yeah brother brother Samuel's meeting
[22:22] there some guys were running the ow you
[22:24] know and other lady was screaming so
[22:27] sometimes people good for attention but
[22:29] like you say sometimes you can't listen
[22:31] to the word cuz somebody's screaming and
[22:33] hollering all the time but uh I mean it
[22:35] kind of made me feel bad cuz over here
[22:37] we're just sitting there you know
[22:38] brother
[22:41] D you know I as a minister you know we
[22:44] like to get amens from people and we
[22:47] like to get because why that that that
[22:49] that that U it brings what God has put
[22:53] it brings it out of us more because
[22:55] you're poor see affirmation that's right
[22:58] brother Dale you know he's preached I
[23:01] guess for a long time I guess he he
[23:02] doesn't need to have your amens but but
[23:05] I'm sure it helps him you
[23:08] know and I know it helps me you know to
[23:12] to to um you know to hear but it doesn't
[23:15] mean you know that I've heard people
[23:17] amen as the preacher is preaching and
[23:19] and right even before they God said
[23:23] amen and he didn't even get to finish
[23:25] what he said and you and you don't even
[23:27] know what he said was wrong was going to
[23:28] be wrong or right you know now see that
[23:31] that right there you know it's just
[23:32] people that are just so used to just
[23:34] saying amen amen amen amen and they
[23:36] don't know kind of like a habit yeah
[23:39] it's kind of like a habit amen it's just
[23:41] the truth the Holy Ghost disorder me and
[23:44] he a gentlemen and when people get
[23:46] physical and Destroy things in the
[23:49] sanctuary and hurt themselves or other
[23:53] people that's not God yeah I wouldn't
[23:56] think that's that's that's God no God is
[23:59] a god of order
