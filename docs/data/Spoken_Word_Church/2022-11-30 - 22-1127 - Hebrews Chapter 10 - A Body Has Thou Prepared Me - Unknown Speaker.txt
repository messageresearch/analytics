========================================

just kind of meditate on these as we prepare for the service in Hebrews chapter 10 verse 1 says for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there and to perfect and uh like we've kind of been talking about thank God that we've got not just a shadow we've got the thing that was promised today we've got access to to the promises of the Holy Ghost and the everything that was part of the atonement that Christ died that was foreshadowed in the Old Testament but then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins I want you to maybe pay close attention to the way Paul words this that he's talking about being purged and your conscience that your soul is purged of your of of of the desire to do wrong by the new birth but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sin every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and a goat should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering that what is not but a body has thou prepared me and burnt offerings and sacrifices for seeing thou Hast had no pleasure then said I love I come in the volume of the book that is written of me to do thy will o God so in verse two if we kind of back up and go through this it says for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscious of sins so if if the sacrifice is in the Old Testament were sufficient enough then then they would have been ceased to be offered but because the the goal here is for your conscience to be purged but in those sacrifices there were there is a remembrance again made of sins every year now you think about what purge mean purge means to take out all the impurities to take out all of the things that are wrong to think out the wrong thoughts to take out the wrong well really what we're talking about is to take out the wrong desire as we'll see here in a second when you what what the new birth does through the promise of the promise of the Holy Ghost is that takes out the desire to do wrong we're used to you you didn't you didn't mind so much uh drinking alcohol or doing all you know do or you didn't mind the wrong Doctrine you didn't mind uh the the things that you were doing living in sin but but when the Holy Ghost comes when Christ is revealed to you then it purges you it takes out all the impurities so your desire has changed now I've got a little example there a little picture of the um a metal being purged and what you know we I can't if you know the process you you once you get metal hot enough then the impurities will rise to the top and you can take a little label there and just start skimming it off so it's the fire of the Holy Ghost that cleanses all the impure it takes all the impurities out it just it bakes it out of us Psalm chapter 51 says behold I was shaping in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desires truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom Purge me with hissel and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be wider than snow now brother around in one place said hyssop represents the cross and another place that represents the Simplicity of your faith it just says that this hiccup is just some common weed that you can grab off the side of the road you can find anywhere and that's how common it is so if you have just simple faith in Christ and the Cross of Christ what he did then that's sufficient enough to allow him to come in and do a work of purging you purging your inward parts and begin to take out all the impurities and the message job he said brother Adam said putting your hand one time upon the head of him and confessing your sins and feeling the things of Calvary when he died of sinners in your stead you'll have no more conscience of sins after that no more conscience of sins well that's a that's a big thing to say no more conscious of sins the worshiper once purged by the blood of Jesus Christ has no more desire to sin don't say you won't sin don't say you won't make a mistake you won't slip up and fall and get you know maybe trip up and fall on your face but you're going to get back up again why but you're going to go repent you're maybe maybe going to cry at the altar a little bit because you have no desire to do it God takes the desire out of you no more desire to sin all goes throughout through the washing of the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness so that's what Paul is talking about when he says that worshiper once purged should have had no more conscience of sins if if the Old Testament sacrifice was sufficient but what we needed was a we needed a new testament sacrifice the sacrifice of Christ's blood his life to die for us on the cross so that his life could come back and live in us and those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year so what what's what's the the gift of the Holy Ghost is to create you a clean heart to clean you out to make change your desires to change your nature so that you're a different to change you so that you want to come to church to change you so that you want your appetize changed you want to serve God now in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year now remember it says you know every every year they come together all the all the Israelites and they'd come together and the high priest would offer on the day of atonement and so forth all the sacrifices and it would remind them you're still a sinner every year they'd come back together and it was a continual reminder that you something's wrong in your heart you you you keep after coming to come back and you see God don't want you to have to keep coming back to the place over you know where you keep going to youth meetings and keep going to special meetings and over and over again but the sacrifice that cried the Christ made on the cross was once for all to to change your heart and change your nature once for all now he said and the message mother Mother's Day he said as the people used to go up to Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost and for the cleansing of the Tabernacle and the sanctuary and the offering of the sin offering each year they was reminded when that lamb died out there that there had come a time that the Lamb of God would die to divorce sin each time that little fellow bleeded and the blood sprinkled over their hands they was reminded that there'd be a time when there would be the Lamb of God that would cry Eli Lama Eli Llama at the cross foreign Gilead he said the spirit of that lamb could not come back into the believer therefore there was a remembrance of sin continually but when a man goes up puts his hands by faith upon the head of Jesus Christ and feels the Pains of sins that he died for him at Calvary and the tearing and the gobs of spit upon his face and the Thorns over his brow and can see what Jesus Christ did for him and accepted upon those bases the spirit of God comes back into the Believers it kills the very nature of sin in him it makes him a new creature he cannot go on like he was because he is a new creature Now isn't that a beautiful story that they're on the cross Christ died for us so that he could arise so that you could die you could die to the to your old nature you could die to the way that you used to think your old desires and be resurrected inwardly to a new life in Christ and that's what the gospel is that you you think different you you walk different you have a different your Nature has been changed I I just I I just feel sometimes inspired just keep stressing that but this the gospel is more than just learning about things but it's a changed life it's God Christ revealed to you to to make you different to make you something different I want to change I want to be like Jesus from where you can okay maybe maybe this morning I think back to how you used to be and what uh because I don't think anybody of any of us or where we want to be but there's some there's been a change in our life if you're born again this morning you you look back and you can see where you used to be um like this picture I've got here your life used to be all torn apart and dark clouds and a tree that didn't bear any fruit but then when Christ revealed himself to you it changed everything that's right and so in Hebrews chapter 10 verse 5 it says wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice an offering thou what is not but a body has thou prepared me so now now all those Old Testament sacrifices and things he we today in the New Testament God doesn't want you to go grab a lamb and and take it up and sacrifice it he he made a he prepared a body to be the sacrifice he made a he made he prepared a body that he could come and live in and Tabernacle himself in that would be sufficient for all the sacrifices more sufficient than all the sacrifices that they did in the Old Testament more sufficient than anything that you could do more sufficient than than any of your works so he don't want you to uh he didn't want you to go grab a lamb and do anything like that but he prepared a body so that he could he could come and die now let's look at this that in Psalm chapter 40 verse 6 it says sacrifice and offering that is not desire mine ears has thou opened burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required now if you've got to examine that in the original Hebrew mind ears hast thou open that scripture in Psalms it's it's kind of a a um a Hebrew saying that means digging ears in other words God has taken like like clay and dug your ears out so that you could hear the word Doug taking a clay body taking your ears and kind of moved moved them with Clay like this picture I've got of somebody of God in other words like God forming the body such that you have the privilege of hearing from God in first Samuel 15 it says and Samuel said hath the Lord has great delight and burn offerings and sacrifices as an obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams so what what does God want you to do this morning make make do a lot of things he just wants you to listen he just wants you you're not saved by all the works that you do although faith will produce Works faith will produce a Life of Christ in you but he don't want you to do anything to be saved just listen I think one of the most profound scriptures in the Bible is that if you'll just come as a little child like Jesus said in Mark chapter 10 that suffer the little children that come unto me and forbid them not for such as the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein so if you can just listen to the gospel like a little child and receive it in your heart then these promises will be made manifest to you amen wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering that would us not but a body has thou prepared me so if we look at the New Living Translation version it says that is why when Christ came into the world he said to God you do not want animal sacrifices or sin offerings but you have given me a body to offer amen you've given me a body to offer and that's Christ's body yeah what a wonderful pattern that they in the Old Testament they built they built their Tabernacle after according to the pattern that Moses saw on the mount and um at you know the anointing men were God anointed to prepare it and and so that it would it would just match exactly that pattern all the all the ornaments and all the tapestries and everything that went into that so that God could come down and dwell in that Tabernacle but what is what his objective was to actually come down and robe himself in flesh so that's the body that Paul is speaking of here and then and the message Oneness he said didn't have to borrow any Timbers anywhere Hebrews the 11th chapter I believe in the second or third verse says that the world was framed by the word of God the things were made out of things that don't appear God just said let there be and there was he didn't have to go over and say Mr Moon would you loan me a little Timber Mr Starr would you let me have some calcium God don't do that he didn't have to say Mary you loan me an egg I want to make a body so I can dwell in God the Creator spoke and she was a mother right then she wasn't a mother she was just a woman bearing his seed that's right I remember she was not Jesus's mother the world said word said so find me one place in scripture ever he called her mother now come back to the word mother of God shame on you see that that body that God prepared was a spoken word body that God spoke and there it was and Zacchaeus the businessman he said then when Emmanuel's vein was broke Jesus was neither Jew nor Gentile the male sex puts out the germ through the hemoglobin and the blood cells from the male the female and you Catholic people not disagree with you but call and Mary Mother of God and how could God have a mother she was an incubator you say well the egg come from the woman but the egg didn't come from Mary if the egg come from Mary then there had to be a sensation look where you put God God created both egg and blood cell he was neither Jew nor Gentile he was God nothing less he was God manifested in flesh did not he say we read in the scriptures that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself he was Emmanuel so that that little flesh body if you think about that that that uh that we've got a I got a little scripture of the body growing in the womb but that the very beginning of that body was formed by because God spoken into existence he made it and of course now from then from that point on it began to absorb nutrients from the mother and the mama eating some some scrambled eggs for breakfast breakfast or whatever and sales were building one on top of the other but that starting point of that that initial uh uh God God spoke that it didn't come no part of that came from Mary and certainly no part of it came from Joseph Luke chapter 22 we're familiar with this where Jesus was sitting there a little boy teaching in the temple and and he said um and his mama his mama went and it makes you wonder how could they lose it we think about sometimes well our parenting mistakes how could they lose him for several days in that Caravan going back to to where they came from and they found him in the temple teaching and he said and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son wise thou thus dealt with us Behold thy father and I have sought thee Sorrowing and he said unto them how is how is it that you sought me wished you not that I must be about my father's business so he was correcting her there I didn't I didn't come from you I came from my father and I'm doing what my fault I'm not I'm not building houses and doing carpentry work but I'm doing what my Father in Heaven would want me to do because he's about his his his business in First Peter chapter 2 it says who his own self bear our sins and his own body on the truth on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose Stripes ye were healed and beholding a greater than Solomon is here brother Adam said God is not an idol God is a spirit and we prostrate ourselves before that and the spirit don't come into some Idol of some so-called Christians would have us to believe but the spirit comes into you and you are God's house living walking around manifesting the Living God for God dwells not in temples made with hands but a body has thou prepared me you are God's letter a written epistle God is in you manifesting himself through if you could prostrate yourself before God and say God I'm a sinner God could come into me and then the Holy Spirit comes in and then you're a living Idol of God living representative of God walking around with God speaking through your lips to others and now I think after you're reading that quote maybe we can read what Paul's saying here a little bit differently sacrifice and offering now what it's not but a body I thou prepared me and burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou has had no pleasure the inside out of low I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o God so then we can see that there's things that are written about Jesus also applies to us the the things that were written about him that a body is thou prepared for me that he wanted to dwell in that body but he wants to dwell in your body and he wanted he wrote that he wrote about Jesus in the book in his book that that he would do his will and also he wrote about you in his book that he you would do his will so the things that are written about Christ are also written about you that the same works that Christ would do the same those same works though the Greater Works that you would do that then maybe we can read this the scripture in a different way a body has thou prepared me and the statue of a perfect man brother around him said now Tabernacle is of course a place where we go to rest now get freshness and so forth we're like resting from sleep or so forth now Hebrews 10 and the fifth verse Paul brings it in wherefore when he cometh into the world he said sacrifice that's Christ sacrifice and offering thou what is not but a body has thou prepared me what is the Tabernacle now a body God tabernacling in a body God wants up high when he come down on the mountain even if a bullock or a cow touched the mountain he must be killed God is Holy last evening last evening when those angels cover their faces holy seraphims with holy faces don't even know what sin means and they have to cover their face in the presence of God cover their feet in humility now holy God could not condone sin so nothing could touch the mountain where God was then God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the form of Jesus Christ his son his creation then that son gave his life and the blood cell of God was broken that the life might come out of the blood to us through that blood we are cleansed and now our blood our life which came by living through sexual desire brought our life in the world the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us changes our Nature by sinning upon us the Holy Spirit then we become into the divine nature of God then we became a dwelling place for God Jesus said at that day you'll know that I am in the father and the father and me I and you and you and me what does that scripture mean that God is in flesh that God's dwelling and manifesting himself in flesh I see see how the scripture has layers and we read but a body has thou prepared me applying to Christ but a body has thou prepared me applying to you as well that God would change your nature to what to what to be like his nature that his virtues and his his knowledge and his patience and all of these all the attributes of Christ will be made real in your life and your nature would be changed so that you don't act like a sinner anymore but you act like Jesus Christ and not act in the sense of an actor but his nature is represented in you and the message expectation he said and now father when he was here on Earth you sent him you told him that he was to do your will I come in the volume of the book to do thy will o God and now he returned back to you after making the sacrifice that of his own self that he could bring many sons unto God and now tonight Lord I as your servant along with these other servants are here to do thy will o God as it is written by him which said the things I do shall you also oh can't you see how the things that are written of Christ are written of you also that Christ was sent to do his the father's will and you are sent to do the father's will but how will you know what the father's will is unless you read his will which is written down in the pages of the Bible you know unless you read the will you don't know you didn't even know how to act before you read the will you didn't know how to dress you didn't know what you were supposed to do you didn't know that you're supposed to assemble yourselves together uh you didn't you don't know you don't know what you're you don't know what you have access to without the will but when you read the will then you begin to realize that you've got promises you've got benefits you've got a benefit package you have you have a healing plan you have access to Salvation you've got promises for your children and all of those things are written in the will so so how do you know what the will of God is the only way to know the will of God is his word to know his word so if you don't know his word then then you won't know his will sometimes we get we get kind of caught up in saying well we I I know what the will of God is because we saw a dream or something like that but if it doesn't match up with the will with the word of God you cannot you don't have anything to base your faith on faith is Faith's final resting place is the word of God so in Matthew Chapter 5 Jesus said let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and for glorify your father which is in heaven think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets I've not come to destroy but to fulfill isn't that what we think sometimes that God came to do away with the Old Testament no he didn't come to do away with it but to take those Old Testament tablets and put them in your heart so that the essence of the law was fulfilled in your members so that your love you love your neighbor you love the Lord thy God with all your heart and all your soul you love your neighbor as yourself and all of those Commandments that are written down that they're actually essence of those things are fulfilled in you prevailing I say unto you till Heaven and Earth past one jot and one Tittle shall in no wise pass from the law to all be fulfilled everything that was written down in the scripture has to be fulfilled in other words in the season that it was meant to be manifested it's going to be manifested and the season that it was meant to be manifested Christ came and walked on the earth and now in the season that that layout of somebody's going to believe in this layout of seeing Church age here you are to manifest the word for your age to fulfill the things that were written of you in the scripture and Hebrews chapter 10 if we keep reading verse 10 it says by the which will by that will we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all and every priest stands daily ministering and offering some oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever set down on the right hand of God from his forth expect until his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he hath perfected forever then that are Sanctified whereof the Holy Ghost also was a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws all those Old Testament laws that we think that we just do away with into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more so what's God doing again he's changing you changing you to think by the renewing of our mind like brother brother Wade's been preaching on and what what is your mind being renewed to to think to brother Brown there's a quote where he said the mind of God is his word so if your mind is being renewed it's being renewed to match up with his word which what he wrote now in the scripture he says I will put my laws into their minds and write them in their hearts so they're no more written just on tables of stone that you can look at but it comes off of the page into a living reality of you where he's using your hands and using your feet and thinking through your mind to think different to molding you into a place where you can believe that all things are possible to them that believe because you're not looking by your eyesight anymore but you're looking looking to the Unseen by eyes of faith and Eyes Of Love where you see things different because the word has transformed you brother Brown said in one in a million he said let me give you a shocking something see not all that saith unto me Lord Lord will enter in but the one that doeth the will of my father his will is his word we can be ever so religious have great times shouting jumping in these meetings which I don't I don't want to be critical but I have a duty to God and that duty is to be sincere and to say what he wants me to say see what he's saying you can get you can get real excited in church the evidence the evidence is never the manifestation the Manifest the evidence is faith faith is the evidence faith will produce manifestation but we don't look at the manifestation as the evidence you see Faith the faith of the revealed Christ in you down in your soul is the evidence the revelation of his word his will is his word so that's what we base everything on that we can see his word not that we jump as the musicians come not that we jump or shout or those things which are great we love manifestation but everything must go back to Faith in his word and I'll just stop right there God bless you foreign [Applause]
