========================================

we all right yeah we are so brother R number four he said it was an Earthly number the number of Deliverance and ew Bullinger said about the same number it was the number of creation the four is the number of of incarnation the number of Deliverance it's it's kind of it can be a double witness of the because number two is a is a witness a confirmation a testimony and Tak it a number four is is 2 * 2 which is a double witness a double confirmation and also represents the Incarnation God manifested in flesh so you never know how long this is going to take so Matthew there's um there's four scriptures that talk about the branch and they classify U Christ in these four different ways lion ox man and eagle and I'll just read it Jeremiah 23:5 it talks about behold the days come sayith the Lord that I will rais unto David A righteous branch and a king shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and Justice in the earth and that's what Matthew's gospel is to present Jesus as the son of David the king of the Jews that will sit upon the throne so the first chapter opens with Christ Royal genealogy I'm I'm just kind of doing a summary of the the four gospels first and then we'll later we'll go through the genealogy and look at who's missing and who's included and why they're included and who is this meisd he said now we've had 2,000 years of teaching coming down through the Roman Catholic church after the apostles then we come down through the Roman Catholic the Greek and so forth on down to Luther's age and Wesley what more 900 different organizations coming down they had all these ages teaching now he promised just before the end time would come that the picture of Sodom and Gomorrah would again as it was in the the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the end time the son of man will reveal himself again let's see you see the Samaritan was actually from my last night's sermon was Hagar see a perverted type the Jew was Sarah was site but the Gentiles of Mary the Royal seed Abraham's Royal seed remember when uh God told G gave Abraham his promise he he showed him first the Sands of the sea and said your your your lineage your seed will be like the Sands of the sea natural then a few chapters over he said look up at the stars your your uh your seed will be like the stars of Heaven the seed spiritual we're uh the Jews of the seed natural and the gentille is a Mary the Royal seed the seed of the promise of Faith the faith seed that you're part of through Christ the second uh let's see in the second chapter of of uh Matthew talks about the wise men journeying from the East inquiring where is he that is born King of the Jews in chapters 5 to 7 are The Sermon on the Mount which is the manifesto of the king he said You' heard in old times it said whoever if you commit adultery you know you'll be stoned but I'll say to you brought it up a level if you U even look upon a woman you commit adultery and he talked about the meek shall inherit the earth who's going to be inheriting the kingdom and he declared the manifesto of his new kingdom not a kingdom of the Earth but a kingdom above we know that the kingdom must be first in you and then one day we'll walk the actual streets of gold but that's that's the New Kingdom uh and it confused the Jews because they were looking for somebody that was going to come with a sword and riding on a big white horse and everything and ride through the streets and kill everybody even Peter you remember when uh they they came to take P Jesus to the cross and he took out his sword and whacked off the high priest son's ear right because they it was it was confusing to them that he would come in a way that they didn't expect but uh he was the king that they were looking for they just didn't expect the way that he came a higher order of the law of Moses blessed are the poor in spirit blessed are the meek in Christ is the mystery of God revealed 1963 Jesus went up to the mountain his first sermon Sermon on the Mount came back down with the Commandments you heard them say them of Old Times Thou shalt not commit adultery I say to you whoever look upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery just uh a brief summary for the word fulfilled because Jesus came to fulfill that the promise of the that he was going to be the king of David the son of David the king he was going to fulfill all that law required the word fulfill occurs 15 times in Matthew and it contains more Old Testament quotations than all the other three and think about the last prophet to the Jews was Malachi so for 400 years after Malachi they were waiting for some for all of these promises to come to pass and all and then all of a sudden the First Gospel written was Matthew with all of these Old Testament quotations the word fulfilled showing that he fulfilled everything that the Old Testament promised the son of David occurs seven times think about the numbers seven it occur son of David occurs exactly seven times in Matthew and Jesus is referred to as King in Matthew 12 times isn't that amazing and in in Mark uh I'll just read Zechariah 38 talking about the different manifestations of the branch the branch is Christ Zechariah 38 says here now oh Joshua the high priest thou and th fellows that sit before thee for they are men wondered at for behold I will bring forth my servant the branch and that's what Ma Mark is the whole subject of Mark is to present Christ as the ox the servant and that's why there is no genealogy in mark because a king has a genealogy in Matthew and in Luke a man has the son of man has a genealogy but in Mark a servant doesn't have a genealogy Christ is the servant of jehos in Philippians 26:7 who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant that was made in the likeness of men so Mark presents him as a servant no genealogy recorded and Christ is introduced at the beginning of his public Ministry instead of talking about um her earlier periods in his life there's more miracles in Mark recorded than in any other gospel because Mark records him as the servant in Luke he's presented as the son of man in Zechariah 6:13 it says and speak unto him saying thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying behold the man whose name is the branch and he shall grow up out of his place and he shall build the Temple of the Lord Christ is the son son of man which is God in flesh a prophet and God manifest God manifests himself in flesh as the son of man to show everyone else that you can partake of the things that I'm presenting that's why we were promised that God would return as the Son and the son of man Ministry in this last day to show us that we could partake of the same things that were presented to us through a prophet 1962 sir we would see Jesus uh the Holy Spirit moving in the church is what does the works that wasn't that body of FLH it probably v he's talking about melkisedek when he came to Abraham but it was God in that flesh showing that God would again dwell in the redeemed flesh of his church in the last days and would do the same sign 1964 sir we would see Jesus Jesus was God in flesh and if Jesus is in you tonight still God manifest himself in the last days the son of man revealing himself in his church the human flesh making himself known you get it see God down here in his church making himself again the word the son of man being being revealed in the last days and it was in the days of Sodom so in Luke we'll look at it more detail next time but gen the genealogy is traced all the way back to Adam not like in Matthew where it's traced from Abraham down but all the way back to Adam showing that he's the son of man in Luke uh Jesus is often seen frequently in prayer and the angels are seen ministering to him instead of in Matthew where he's presented as the king he's more often shown commanding the Angels but in Luke there ministering to him in John Isaiah 4:2 says in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel Christ is revealed John the first three gospels they kind of they kind of uh present him in the same way then all of a sudden you get to John John is totally different it presents himself it's I I really like John because this is the eagle chapter the eagle book of the Bible John is presenting God Jesus says God Christ is revealed as the Son of God Supernatural walking among the candlesticks down through the seven Church ages U John 1:1 declares that Jesus is the creator of all things now uh if you look at Matthew Mark and Luke you might kind of get the idea that Jesus started at at his birth but when you look at John he's the one that was back there in the beginning creating he's he's the Eternal one um he declares who the comforter is none of the other gospels declare that Jesus is the comforter it it it uh it I guess you could say it's maybe one of the most confusing gospels because John 14:18 says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you then John 14:26 says the father will send the comforter in my name he's sending in in Jesus name and John is the only gospel that declares whose name the comforter comes in and who it is is is coming to you Jesus John 15:26 Jesus will send the comforter from the Father John 16:7 says I will send him unto you John 16:25 says but the time cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in Proverbs but I shall show you plainly of the father I shall show you plainly of the father because it's Christ that's coming to the believer prayer and it's also the only gospel that says prayer should be in his name John John 16: 2627 at that day ye shall ask in my name and I say down unto you that I will pray the father for you for the father himself loveth you because ye have loved me and have believed that I came out from God so those are the four gospels to present Christ in four different ways as a lion ox man and eagle and um make sure that that's everything that I have I see it J
