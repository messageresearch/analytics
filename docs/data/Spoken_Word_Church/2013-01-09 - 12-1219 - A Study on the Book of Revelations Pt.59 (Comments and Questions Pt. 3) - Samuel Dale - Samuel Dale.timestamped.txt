[3:54] people's mind yes you be the answer to
[3:57] all things because we can talk all day
[3:59] long and it wouldn't change no one but
[4:02] yet just one word from you would be
[4:05] worth more than anything we love you and
[4:07] we thank you in Jesus name
[4:16] amen Revelations 1:1 the revelation of
[4:19] Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to
[4:22] show unto his servants things which must
[4:24] shortly come to pass and he said and
[4:26] signified it by his Angel and to his
[4:28] servant John
[4:30] who by record of the word of God and of
[4:32] the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[4:34] things that he saw blessed is he that
[4:37] reth and they that hear the words of
[4:39] this prophecy and keep those things
[4:41] which are written
[4:43] therein why for the time is at hand the
[4:47] time to understand right Matthew
[4:52] 24 verse one and Jesus went out and
[4:55] departed from the temple and his
[4:56] disciples came to him for to sh him the
[4:59] buildings of the temple and Jesus said
[5:02] unto them see you not all these things
[5:05] verily I say unto you there shall not be
[5:08] left here one stone upon another that
[5:11] shall not be thrown down and he set upon
[5:14] as he set upon the Mount of Olives that
[5:15] was the morning here in the afternoon
[5:18] the disciples came unto him privately
[5:20] saying tell us when shall these things
[5:22] be what one stone won't be left on
[5:25] another what shall be the sign of thy
[5:27] coming mhm
[5:30] and of the end of the world you may be
[5:32] seated the Lord add his Blessing to to
[5:35] the reading of the word and we were
[5:37] we've been trying to cover some things
[5:40] about the
[5:41] uh what we've been speaking on on the
[5:44] seals and so we had a little time there
[5:47] Sunday that we got into a couple of
[5:48] questions but if anybody has any
[5:51] questions tonight about the the opening
[5:53] of the seals the things that we've been
[5:55] talking about I would that you would ask
[5:58] them now and that way we can try to
[6:00] cover that part and then move on to uh
[6:04] some of the other questions that we have
[6:07] and I've had some lay back car on my
[6:10] desk for about a year now I guess and
[6:13] had them laying there I just ain't got
[6:14] around to answer them yet we have a
[6:16] little time we'll try to answer maybe a
[6:18] little bit tonight but anybody got any
[6:20] comments any thoughts about the seals
[6:23] cuz what we've been covering is that
[6:25] when we look at the seals we know that
[6:28] the literal part of what will happen
[6:31] under those seals like the man of sin
[6:33] sitting in the temple of God showing
[6:35] himself to be as God will be on P our
[6:38] time we're not in the time of the
[6:41] literal happening of those things that's
[6:43] right but we are in the time of the
[6:46] working up to that y you know and it
[6:49] takes a long time to get those things
[6:51] into motion and all and that's what
[6:54] we're trying to see what it is now to
[6:57] you know our part right you know and to
[7:00] know what is in in into you and I and
[7:03] that's what I've encouraged you to read
[7:06] the seal book and to uh you know try to
[7:11] find yourself not what the seal is about
[7:14] in a literal extent of white horse rider
[7:17] red horse rider black horse rider Etc uh
[7:20] you know fifth seal Sixth Seal but to
[7:23] read it to see what it's speaking to you
[7:25] right in your hearts and your lives and
[7:29] I I ask you to please cuz when the Lord
[7:31] willing we'll get to it Sunday anyway uh
[7:33] start on the seventh seal so if I would
[7:37] ask you if you would just take the
[7:40] seventh seal message and sit down and
[7:42] listen to it or read it and just read it
[7:45] with an open heart to find out what is
[7:48] it speaking to you or what does it have
[7:52] to do with you you know and what it will
[7:56] be and we'll take some things and cover
[7:58] it as we go along to see how that will
[8:01] work but the main thing is to find
[8:04] ourselves Amen in the revealing of the
[8:07] word because the Seven Seals reveals a
[8:10] complete Plan of Redemption we covered
[8:12] it there's only really six seals to the
[8:14] plan because there's nothing real
[8:16] revealed under the Sabbath but it is so
[8:19] important it must be
[8:22] revealed and then that way we'll get
[8:24] into covering some of the things the
[8:26] prophet has said about it and maybe it
[8:29] will be interesting to do does anybody
[8:31] have any comments any thoughts about the
[8:34] seals cuz some had some they didn't
[8:37] bring and then maybe you can do it that
[8:40] way anybody got any comments any
[8:43] thoughts about what we've been talking
[8:46] on of the
[8:48] seals you know and what I mean by that
[8:51] is in relation to the opening of the
[8:54] seals we the questions I have is in
[8:57] relationship about us with the seals you
[9:01] know and and and connecting to us so
[9:04] it's not saying that this is not
[9:05] connected all the whole word is
[9:07] connected to the seals but it's complete
[9:09] Plan of Redemption any any comments any
[9:13] thoughts that anybody would have to
[9:16] questions about what we've been speaking
[9:22] on if not then we'll just go on in to to
[9:26] pick up the questions and u
[9:29] you know try to continue the thought
[9:32] from the the questions that we were
[9:34] recovering
[9:36] Sunday and relation all of these
[9:39] questions basically are related into the
[9:43] subject of Body Spirit Soul right you
[9:48] know what is this what is that what's
[9:52] the workings of those things and uh you
[9:56] know then it relates back in see will
[9:59] fine like going back into the seals uh
[10:02] because it covers Souls Under The Altar
[10:04] and where they're at and what they're
[10:05] doing and all but
[10:09] now the last thought we were dealing
[10:12] with was the last part of the question
[10:13] and I said we'd stop right here and then
[10:16] we would continue
[10:18] on and the question part was when
[10:21] someone dies it sounds
[10:24] like they're divided into three
[10:27] different places you know the body in
[10:29] one place the spirit in another place
[10:31] the soul in another place and that would
[10:35] would be
[10:36] true and would have to be true because
[10:39] it would be
[10:42] uh you can't put it all
[10:45] together there's things that are in our
[10:48] body that would not be uh what would you
[10:52] call it used or or uh what would be the
[10:56] point word uh they don't connect
[11:00] together MH you know this body has a
[11:03] cast feel smelling here all right
[11:06] now it has no love in it
[11:12] no it doesn't have any uh in this body
[11:16] has no sense of of emotions and things
[11:20] it just displays those things that's
[11:23] right if you just put the body by itself
[11:26] the C test F and smelling here wouldn't
[11:28] even work NOP so you got to have the
[11:30] unit amen you can't you can't get away
[11:34] from having the unit of Body Spirit and
[11:36] soul because God is a unit right but
[11:40] he's not a trinity of
[11:43] beings right but he's a triun being
[11:46] right amen all right so he has Father
[11:49] Son and Holy Ghost the
[11:51] manifestations but he's he's not a
[11:54] trinity so you and I are not a trinity
[11:57] we are a trown being
[11:59] right that's the difference between us
[12:01] and a dog or something right is the the
[12:04] the triun part of us or the part of the
[12:08] soul the animal has a life it has a
[12:13] spirit a
[12:15] body but it doesn't have a soul right
[12:18] and my point I think that what I see
[12:21] about maybe has always been the trouble
[12:25] is we never were explain these things
[12:29] things
[12:31] until the the the prophet's message came
[12:34] into be you know we we never had any
[12:37] concern yet it was there in the Bible
[12:40] and people tried to explain it you know
[12:42] and do
[12:43] things but it wasn't uh anything
[12:48] prevalent right and you know it wasn't a
[12:51] major
[12:53] thing but here we are in the end time
[12:56] when as I was trying to explain the
[12:58] other day that we're in the time where
[13:00] that these bodies are going to be
[13:01] redeemed amen so we have to find
[13:05] out how these things work and what makes
[13:09] it work or what makes us do to learn how
[13:13] to bring the body into
[13:17] subjection unto the spirit that's within
[13:20] it amen right and that's that's well and
[13:23] good to bring it under subjection to the
[13:26] spirit but if there's a different part
[13:28] if there's something different between
[13:30] that spirit and that
[13:32] Soul then that to me would be and you
[13:36] have to admit there is yes even in a
[13:40] sinner a sinner Soul being part of what
[13:44] they
[13:44] are cries out for a maker
[13:48] worships U has uh about it that wants to
[13:53] to do all right because it's that's what
[13:58] what it is that's a difference in it an
[14:00] animal right all right then in doing
[14:03] that see then you would have to come
[14:07] into a position of understanding the
[14:09] difference between the soul and the
[14:13] spirit see then you just say well the
[14:16] soul is just the nature of the spirit
[14:18] but see then you're not making the soul
[14:20] anything other than some form like a
[14:25] bird dog comparing it to a hound dog
[14:30] and you were just making it different
[14:31] that
[14:32] way
[14:36] but I
[14:38] believe that we as
[14:40] Christians ought to come to a place
[14:44] somewhere until
[14:46] that Soul should be controlling us right
[14:53] you say well does it all the time no it
[14:55] doesn't now all the time I I differ with
[14:58] people that say
[14:59] oh I'm just LED of the Lord all the time
[15:01] I just I wish I was yeah I'm not saying
[15:05] or not I'm just saying I can't find that
[15:08] in the word right right I couldn't find
[15:11] it in the prophet's message
[15:14] M because I know he had a lot of
[15:17] problems and I can't find it in Jesus in
[15:19] the
[15:21] Bible because there was times that
[15:23] things bothered him and troubles and
[15:25] different things right right I think
[15:29] it's very vital that we understand the
[15:32] difference between Soul and
[15:35] Spirit and then you got to remember that
[15:37] sometimes you're using
[15:41] quotes that you you have to put the
[15:44] relationship into the form that supposed
[15:46] to be because in the early Ministry
[15:49] brother Ram would call your second real
[15:51] of your being you call it
[15:55] Soul then you call a CER in spirit
[16:01] so then you're studying the vastness of
[16:04] 15600 messages that when you're dealing
[16:07] basically up to
[16:10] 1962 that he would just interrelate
[16:13] those
[16:14] things because if you make a bible
[16:17] study on on the you'll have very little
[16:22] in the Bible to study about the
[16:26] soul you you got a whole lot more
[16:29] relationship of thoughts about the
[16:31] spirit M even till it says Spirits in
[16:35] prison
[16:37] right all right
[16:40] now but see we need to get an
[16:45] understanding of what we
[16:47] are what's taking
[16:50] place and in that then we
[16:53] can we can
[16:56] see ourselves right all right and we we
[17:00] need to keep in
[17:01] consideration as I said now when we try
[17:04] to study the
[17:06] message that you're going to have to
[17:09] study it thinking about even like where
[17:13] it says in Ezekiel 36 I believe it is he
[17:17] said I I give you a new heart right and
[17:20] a new
[17:22] spirit well now God don't take your
[17:24] heart out and do a
[17:27] transplant and that's none of those
[17:30] things are in relationship or even can
[17:33] be used as a type of
[17:37] doings because it's not in that form so
[17:41] then what you have to do is you have to
[17:43] sit down and just listen and like I've
[17:46] always said now you say well brother
[17:48] randam never corrected That Body Spirit
[17:50] soul soul Spirit body you know all he
[17:54] didn't have
[17:56] to because
[17:59] he
[18:00] always gave the outside
[18:03] right five senses right right c t fi
[18:07] smelling
[18:09] here he always gave even though he would
[18:12] call it
[18:14] soul in his early Ministry he always
[18:17] gave
[18:18] it reason memory conscience affections
[18:22] something like that the five senses and
[18:25] then he would always no matter whether
[18:28] one would be calling the inward
[18:31] part of us he would always say that it
[18:34] has only one
[18:36] sense and that's either Faith or doubt
[18:39] right so you're either born again or
[18:41] you're not born again
[18:43] right and then I believe the new birth
[18:45] is not in the spirit because we' come
[18:48] into the day of understanding that's
[18:50] right anointed
[18:52] ones they can be anointed in your spirit
[18:55] all of your life and still be lost right
[18:57] now that that's a horrible
[18:59] thinking whether you think about it or
[19:01] not wouldn't it be something to go all
[19:03] the way through your life as a preacher
[19:07] and give your whole life
[19:10] to serving God and
[19:13] preaching and then stand there and him
[19:15] say depart from you I never knew you
[19:18] right he never argued with him about
[19:22] what they were
[19:24] doing he just said I never knew you said
[19:26] you've never born again right
[19:28] right see I believe that new birth it
[19:31] has to be in that Soul amen it's not in
[19:34] the body it's not in the spirit all
[19:37] right now to me
[19:41] then I'm not trying to be something
[19:43] derogatory to anybody in your belief
[19:46] because we all have to uh if God don't
[19:49] reveal it it ain't revealed I don't care
[19:52] what you talk about what you do right
[19:55] and that arguing somebody is not going
[19:58] to do any
[20:00] good but take some of the things that
[20:03] I'm saying and put it down and just
[20:06] think about
[20:07] it that anointing can be on that Spirit
[20:10] of that individual right of the genuine
[20:12] Holy
[20:14] Spirit and the person
[20:16] lost right
[20:20] right but if that true New
[20:25] Birth is in that soul
[20:29] that person can never be lost
[20:32] righten now that should to me should
[20:36] give
[20:37] more thought or idea to the basis
[20:41] of that the soul and the spirit is not
[20:44] the same thing right or even not so and
[20:49] I know it is so closely related I agree
[20:51] I know that but we all we know the the
[20:55] ourselves but there still has to be a a
[20:57] different
[21:00] between the soul and the
[21:02] spirit if not then you would just have
[21:06] your new birth and your soul in your
[21:09] spirit and and I heard a man say one
[21:12] time that he said I believe we need our
[21:16] brain baptized with the Holy Ghost well
[21:18] I said
[21:20] amen I think that's right I'd like to
[21:23] have my brain baptized with the holy
[21:25] spirit all right now let me say this way
[21:30] what I've always tried to say to
[21:33] you see putting it together and
[21:36] understanding the message then we're
[21:37] going to read the quotes I mean read the
[21:39] questions related and you'll
[21:41] see
[21:43] that to me now the way I see Body Spirit
[21:50] soul I see you just
[21:53] like God is father son Holy
[21:57] Ghost three manifestations with the same
[22:01] God and we are a
[22:04] unit yeah of Body Spirit and soul that's
[22:07] a
[22:08] unit but then to understand where the
[22:11] new birth is
[22:13] at it's not in my
[22:16] body it's not in my spirit right cuz
[22:20] Ezekiel said I give you a new heart
[22:22] right then he go only said I give you
[22:24] new spirit but R said now that's not the
[22:27] Holy Spirit
[22:30] he said that's giving you a new spirit
[22:31] he said go you couldn't even stand
[22:33] yourself the way it
[22:34] was that's right see then the scripture
[22:39] then says I put my spirit in you
[22:44] right now
[22:46] truly the new birth is the baptism of
[22:50] the Holy
[22:52] Spirit see I I've tried to explain
[22:56] that
[22:58] and let me attempt again because I want
[23:00] you to
[23:01] understand I
[23:05] mean
[23:07] that part of you that is the
[23:11] body you know the outward part we blame
[23:16] that fell for all the
[23:19] trouble he ain't to
[23:23] trouble he he he may be in trouble he's
[23:25] under the curse you know all right
[23:28] that's part of it
[23:30] but without something motivating
[23:34] it and with even something to motivate
[23:37] in a certain way you you're no different
[23:40] than any other
[23:44] animal right all animals are motivated
[23:47] by Spirit absolutely right
[23:50] amen and we're motivated by
[23:54] Spirit but see the soul is the part that
[23:56] God is trying brother souls in prison he
[23:59] said he can get that soul to stand still
[24:01] long enough amen he said it'll die yes
[24:06] well see then what I've tried to get you
[24:09] to see
[24:12] about a lot of people say well you know
[24:15] the Holy
[24:18] Spirit and come down and come in
[24:22] me and says anointed ones it didn't come
[24:25] in
[24:26] them all right you got a
[24:31] point but why don't you hold it to a
[24:33] true line
[24:35] point a very fine line to keep it
[24:39] straight and see then you can see that
[24:41] the Holy Spirit can come on your
[24:45] spirit whether you're saved or
[24:48] lost now it has to deal with a religious
[24:51] form right right the Holy Spirit doesn't
[24:54] just come down on everybody's spirit in
[24:56] the
[24:56] world it it's part when you begin to
[24:59] come into a religious order right
[25:04] sanctification right and when it does
[25:07] the Holy Spirit comes down upon your
[25:11] spirit and that Spirit of that
[25:13] individual actually takes a
[25:17] change
[25:19] right it begins to want to go to
[25:22] church it begins to want to serve God
[25:26] why because it's the Holy Spirit
[25:33] the problem is is like the disciples I
[25:36] mean like the Bible said Jesus said some
[25:38] of them took the word and held it right
[25:41] all right they had something for the
[25:42] Holy Spirit to
[25:43] Quicken but what about those others that
[25:46] didn't take the word and hold
[25:48] it they didn't have anything for the
[25:50] Holy Spirit to
[25:53] Quicken so what is that new
[25:56] birth which we say it's the birth of the
[25:58] word and it's
[26:00] true the word we' took and held all
[26:04] right so then what would be the
[26:05] difference in an anointed one and a a
[26:08] born again
[26:11] Christian embody their Christians both
[26:14] of them
[26:16] yep right that's right in
[26:19] spirit you know the love the memories
[26:23] the different the want to go to church
[26:25] to do it they're both Christians
[26:29] y That's why brother random will call
[26:32] them
[26:33] Christians he'll say Christians when
[26:36] when he then he said now you you
[26:38] Christians need to go get born again you
[26:41] know y you say well if I'm a Christian
[26:45] what I need to get born again
[26:47] for is using the word Christian as to
[26:49] just a person making a confession the
[26:52] spirit of God coming upon him and it's
[26:54] the same Holy
[26:56] Spirit
[27:02] but what is that new birth
[27:05] then now listen to me very
[27:08] carefully and you'll see what I've been
[27:10] driving at for 40
[27:15] years I don't believe now listen very
[27:17] carefully somebody speci me out there
[27:19] you just hearing one message you you're
[27:21] going to get messed up in what I'm
[27:23] fixing to say and make me say something
[27:25] I'm not saying so just remember I warn
[27:27] you other
[27:29] that just say what I'm saying you have
[27:32] any problem call me I I'll be glad to
[27:34] talk to you
[27:35] about see I believe that Holy Spirit
[27:38] coming
[27:39] down upon your
[27:42] spirit it comes down on your spirit just
[27:45] like it comes down on an anointed one
[27:50] sure and it's a genuine Holy Spirit
[27:55] sure and you start going to church
[27:59] you start wanting to be good and you
[28:02] start loving God go said you love God
[28:04] with your
[28:07] spirit AR you begin a a form of what we
[28:11] call a Christian
[28:15] life but then you see those people
[28:19] that a lot of them won't continue
[28:23] on you say well does that anointing
[28:25] leave their spirit m-
[28:29] unnecessary
[28:31] right cuz they can go right out in the
[28:35] world commit adultery come right back in
[28:38] church and Shout Glory
[28:42] Hallelujah you said well well God ain't
[28:44] got nothing to do with
[28:46] that glad you thought of it that
[28:51] way cuz that dealing in that Spirit real
[28:55] right is not the new birth
[29:00] does that Holy Spirit as the Spirit come
[29:04] down into one but don't come down into
[29:06] the other is that what you
[29:15] think you see I've always tried to
[29:18] explain to you one
[29:20] thing that anointing can come down on
[29:22] your
[29:23] spirit and you're still
[29:26] lost
[29:29] but what does that Holy Spirit
[29:32] do why does it say some took the word
[29:37] and held
[29:39] it why would brother around say David
[29:42] said Thy word have I hid in my heart
[29:46] that I might not sin against thee right
[29:49] right around and said all he
[29:51] need is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[29:55] that's right and yet the Holy Ghost
[29:58] would be on him to kill a
[30:02] bar to kill a lion to kill a
[30:07] giant it would be on him to write
[30:14] Psalms just one after the other hundreds
[30:17] of the ssongs are written by David
[30:20] singing and he would actually sing in
[30:23] the first person they pierce my hands
[30:25] and my feet
[30:28] we ever around and said what he needed
[30:30] was the baptism of the Holy
[30:34] Ghost they was already anointed on his
[30:37] spirit and it would even be told of the
[30:40] prophets Etc
[30:42] y don't touch my
[30:47] anointed see you you you get in trouble
[30:49] in a hurry touching the anointing of God
[30:52] that was on a
[30:53] person amen right amen and it was a true
[30:57] through
[30:58] anointing
[31:02] right but yet he didn't have the
[31:09] birth now I hope you can understand why
[31:12] brother R said you can have that baptism
[31:14] of the Holy Spirit every day of your
[31:15] life right and still be
[31:18] wrong that's the simple point of trying
[31:20] to explain it right see then what would
[31:23] be the difference in the Old Testament
[31:24] person and a new testament person
[31:28] Glory Hallelujah we have baptism of the
[31:30] Holy Ghost
[31:31] David could stand
[31:34] there and sing in the first person
[31:39] right and you tell me that the Holy
[31:41] Spirit wasn't on his spirit
[31:45] amen tell you your so messed
[31:48] up because it be down on him and do
[31:51] those great things
[31:53] right and those prophets would receive
[31:56] from
[31:58] God Moses could tell you what happened
[32:01] in
[32:03] Genesis all about the the Genesis one
[32:07] man and the Genesis two man and yep
[32:12] yeah he said well he just wrote down
[32:15] what the Lord told him well that's good
[32:18] the Lord did tell him right but what
[32:21] would be the differ David would be a
[32:24] wonderful Pew dweller in the New
[32:26] Testament
[32:28] I I use that to way I want to pew pew
[32:31] you know a church
[32:33] member right right that's good I mean
[32:38] who in the world who would be a pastor
[32:40] wouldn't want David to be in this
[32:41] congregation
[32:45] right who would want Moses in his
[32:49] congregation no no no now brother Dale
[32:52] now we wouldn't want David we might
[32:55] accept Moses but David was was living in
[32:57] adultery well how many people in this
[32:59] message are living in adultery even the
[33:02] one that would say those
[33:04] things what about spiritual
[33:07] ulry but my point has always been one
[33:12] thing if you could have the baptism of
[33:15] the Holy
[33:17] Spirit and it could do those wonderful
[33:22] things why did you need Jesus to die
[33:26] right right
[33:31] you can't say it was to release the
[33:37] Spirit come
[33:40] on
[33:42] Amen it wasn't to just say I'm going to
[33:45] release the
[33:49] spirit that's why Jesus sent it
[33:52] mhm and the scripture said his his
[33:55] Spirit went back to God who gave it
[33:57] he said into thy hands I commend my
[34:07] spirit what's the difference then in the
[34:09] Old Testament
[34:11] person who could be so anointed that he
[34:14] was speaking to first
[34:16] person and a new testament
[34:20] person what's the difference and why did
[34:23] Jesus have to
[34:25] die
[34:30] it wasn't just to pay the price right
[34:33] that was part of it well he had to die
[34:36] to pay the price for me and
[34:37] you you got a good point but
[34:41] remember the blood of bulls and
[34:44] goats paid the price that's right mhm
[34:47] that's
[34:48] right right right come on Amen we know
[34:53] it didn't eradicate we understand that
[34:55] it's all tied together together he
[34:57] didn't eradicate sin nobody paid the
[35:00] price right that's why brother R said
[35:04] was look back there under the blood of
[35:05] bulls and goats and they done those
[35:07] things and he said we're under the blood
[35:09] of Jesus Christ right he's sure to be
[35:15] ashamed see then what was the purpose of
[35:19] Jesus
[35:23] dying if it wasn't to just and it was in
[35:26] involved to pay the price yes right it
[35:29] was involved yes we know that come
[35:33] on it was involved to have the spirit
[35:37] that was within
[35:39] him that seemingly throughout the Old
[35:41] Testament that it wasn't basically on
[35:45] everybody right because you only have
[35:48] writings of it being on certain ones you
[35:52] know now all would sing and worship and
[35:55] you call that the anointing and the
[35:57] different but you understand what I'm
[35:58] getting at I hope did you just have a
[36:01] David you have a a Saul you know you
[36:05] have a and you say Saul yeah cuz he was
[36:09] listed with the prophets
[36:11] sure and the Holy Spirit was upon
[36:15] him but then you get down into the New
[36:18] Testament and you
[36:20] see you said well that new testament
[36:24] just makes us to where we we we we love
[36:28] God and are willing to give our
[36:35] life you better remember
[36:39] Moses and he said Lord you're going to
[36:43] block their name
[36:44] out right block my name out first words
[36:48] you're going to get to them you got to
[36:50] come over
[36:52] me those people had a great
[36:55] desire
[36:59] but that Soul inside of that
[37:03] individual there was no
[37:06] way the soul of God could come back upon
[37:10] those Old Testament Saints right right
[37:13] that's
[37:15] right that's why Jesus had to die right
[37:18] Jesus had to die to release the very
[37:20] Soul
[37:24] y of almighty God
[37:27] right that's why I believe it brother
[37:30] say in body he was a man said in spirit
[37:32] he was God and said in Soul he was
[37:37] God that's why I've always preached to
[37:39] you that that baby that was born down
[37:41] there when that baby was born God's very
[37:43] Soul came in that body his very Spirit
[37:46] of his being right came in that body
[37:50] amen or else you're a trinitarian right
[37:54] right you're not a Triune your
[37:59] Trinity but you see if if he had to give
[38:02] that
[38:06] Soul see you can't make a ransom just
[38:08] out of the
[38:11] body right come on right he say he gave
[38:15] his soul a r that's GRE but what aboutt
[38:18] where he sa I mean he gave his body a r
[38:20] what about where he gave his soul R
[38:22] right
[38:24] M so that soul is in important thing
[38:28] amen there was no way that the soul of
[38:31] God could come back in an Old Testament
[38:33] person right cuz there was nothing to be
[38:36] able to work
[38:39] upon him in his soul right
[38:44] right and you say well it's just honesty
[38:46] and
[38:48] sweetness and you go to two of them some
[38:51] continent I hate to say Africa cuz
[38:53] people are sitting here and they think I
[38:55] thre off on them I'm not making dummies
[38:57] out of Africans and that's great with
[38:59] the biggest dummies of them all right
[39:02] told you we're just to mixed up
[39:03] Caucasian which is
[39:06] concoction this terminology is using
[39:10] it but you see that
[39:14] person they love their
[39:17] God they'll give their children to an
[39:23] aligator because they love their God and
[39:25] they think their God told him to do it
[39:27] that's right well you can't make it just
[39:29] in love and sweetness
[39:33] and we see Jesus died to release that
[39:40] soul to where on the day of Pentecost
[39:42] brother said his soul came back in the
[39:45] form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[39:47] amen that's right did it stop on our
[39:50] spirit
[39:55] m
[39:57] right the 120 in the upper room did it
[40:00] just come down to their
[40:05] Spirit well what happened
[40:10] there the key is to understand that the
[40:14] word they
[40:18] held they held that word and said you
[40:21] you've got the words of eternal life
[40:23] where can we go right we've seen
[40:25] everything else fail there's no need of
[40:27] us turning back trying to go back to our
[40:35] churches but that Soul came back on the
[40:37] day of
[40:39] Pentecost and didn't stop on that
[40:42] Spirit of Peter James John whatever you
[40:45] want call them The Upper Room
[40:49] experience it wasn't just an anointing
[40:52] on their
[40:55] spirit
[40:57] it was a quickening of that word they
[40:59] had in their heart right right you
[41:03] agree see now then you're not just
[41:06] dealing with an anointing or
[41:09] something right when you talk when I
[41:12] talk about the alive word that's right
[41:15] I'm talking about Zoe God's own life the
[41:19] alive
[41:20] word when the word is revealed to you no
[41:23] matter what it is there's one God it's
[41:24] revealed to you that's though he Li
[41:26] right
[41:28] right I'd rather put my whole Christian
[41:32] experience and I have to base it on
[41:35] that upon the basis
[41:38] that when that Spirit anointed
[41:43] me it quickened that word
[41:47] amen that I have for two years planted
[41:50] into my heart
[41:54] right I didn't claim this because I came
[41:56] in the
[41:57] message that I had the Holy
[42:01] Ghost I've talked to you and told you
[42:03] about things that happened in my life
[42:05] when I was a kid and I saw
[42:09] God I never counted that to New
[42:14] Birth I can remember when I went to the
[42:17] altar in
[42:22] Repentance I remember then how that
[42:25] things begin to turn and I just never
[42:28] was like the other people that could
[42:31] just go out and live like the devil and
[42:33] come to church and have to go outside
[42:37] smoke I didn't see no difference back
[42:39] then in smoking and drinking I
[42:43] didn't I never made a table that certain
[42:45] people going to go to heaven because
[42:47] they they they smoked but the others
[42:50] drank wasn't going to get to
[42:53] go yeah I never was that way I wouldn't
[42:56] like this lady was standing at my mother
[42:58] LS one day and the guy a neighbor was
[42:59] cutting Grace Sunday afternoon she said
[43:02] he'll pay for that one day he'll die and
[43:04] go to hell cutting that grass on Sunday
[43:06] oh my that's what she
[43:10] belied
[43:13] yeah but you see that new birth is when
[43:17] that
[43:18] word that you've
[43:20] held what little bit it is no matter
[43:23] what right or how much great out that it
[43:27] is for 2
[43:29] years I studied
[43:32] studied pulled away my family lived as a
[43:36] I done the best I could do working for a
[43:38] living and and and
[43:41] everything but yet all I had on my mind
[43:43] was one
[43:46] thing I wanted that
[43:50] word never lost
[43:53] that I still want that word right
[43:57] amen never became dull to
[44:00] me oh yeah there a lot of days goes by
[44:03] and I didn't hear from him about it me
[44:05] and brother Gary talks about that a lot
[44:06] right we talk about the you know the
[44:10] days when sometimes you say well boy
[44:13] I've been all this week and ain't felt
[44:14] the presence of the Lord you go about
[44:16] three months and preach three services a
[44:18] week and still ain't heard had no
[44:21] contact with God
[44:25] seemingly if you don't want to you want
[44:27] to try that I'll be glad to let you have
[44:29] a few months in the pull pit you know
[44:31] you'll find out it works really good for
[44:33] a little while right brother Gary after
[44:35] a while it just kind of dries
[44:37] up and you wonder what in the world am I
[44:39] doing up here I it don't even seem like
[44:41] a Christan little on
[44:43] preacher you just keep right on
[44:45] preaching
[44:47] right go outside so down and out in your
[44:50] own self and you just want to
[44:54] cry you just feel like you're
[44:58] lost and somebody come up and they say
[45:02] Brother Sam I really enjoyed that
[45:05] message I saw what you're talking
[45:08] about then they could bring it back to
[45:11] you you know you say well they seen
[45:16] it but you see that Soul inside of there
[45:19] is what God is dealing with
[45:22] right no if not we' be Old Testament
[45:24] people just like them we have anointing
[45:26] on our
[45:28] spirit but you see the word that you
[45:31] held the word them disciples held Was
[45:33] Made Alive on the day of Pentecost
[45:36] right and that being the
[45:40] word there is your soul your nature your
[45:45] being your
[45:47] person what other things could be
[45:50] called that's almighty god sister G amen
[45:54] I'd rather have you was in the kitchen
[45:57] buming or doing something one day God
[45:59] said that that's just one
[46:02] God I rather how that and all of the
[46:05] things I told you I can take you
[46:08] today Mark the place in the church where
[46:11] I saw
[46:12] God but I never called that a new
[46:19] birth I
[46:21] did I never said coming into the
[46:24] message me I had a new birth
[46:27] right when I heard brother ROM talking
[46:30] about God I
[46:32] realized this man is talking about a
[46:35] person this man is not talking about
[46:37] anointing on spirits that can do things
[46:41] right this man is talking about a
[46:44] person something that's real
[46:47] right not something that you could shout
[46:50] hallelujah today walk outside and cuss
[46:52] the raise
[46:54] can I didn't believe it that back
[47:01] then but you see the soul of almighty
[47:03] God came back on the day of Pentecost
[47:07] you said the soul of God
[47:09] yeah well what are you going to call
[47:13] it if you call it the spirit you're
[47:15] going to cross up yourself
[47:18] right because I'm standing up here
[47:20] talking to you about that that Spirit
[47:22] was already there yep that's right
[47:25] that's Spirit you think about being a
[47:27] spirit was already there they cast out
[47:29] devil they healed the sick that's right
[47:31] that's
[47:33] right without the new birth that's right
[47:40] y it does mighty wonderful things in
[47:42] that Old Testament right without the new
[47:45] birth amen what's the different in the
[47:47] Old Testament the new then the new
[47:50] doesn't just bring you an anointing upon
[47:52] your spirit
[47:54] Realm
[47:56] it goes down in that
[47:58] soul and wipes out that very nature of
[48:02] Satan come on Amen I believe that's
[48:05] right why do you think it's called a
[48:07] fire over there coming out of those two
[48:09] witnesses
[48:11] mouth why do you think the the the
[48:14] writer would say say like fire shut up
[48:16] in my
[48:19] bosom he know that much about it
[48:24] right
[48:26] the new birth never made me quit
[48:30] drinking I didn't do
[48:35] it it didn't make me quit smoking I
[48:38] didn't do
[48:39] it sure puffed the little bit as a kid
[48:42] like every
[48:44] kid thr it away and said want nothing to
[48:47] do with
[48:48] it I wouldn't even confessing Christian
[48:50] and the Baptist at that
[48:54] time
[48:56] lying cheating and stealing and stuff
[48:58] like that I I didn't have no problems
[49:00] with that before I become a Christian
[49:02] even in the
[49:07] Baptist I'd go out and do things wrong
[49:09] go home and feel
[49:15] dirty feel
[49:19] dirty with a Joy about what I've
[49:24] done people tell me so I got to a drunk
[49:26] life and I don't remember what I done I
[49:27] said you
[49:28] dummy right you didn't enjoy
[49:33] it CU he enjoyed it you still remember
[49:38] it but what is the difference in the old
[49:41] and the new
[49:43] then that soul of almighty
[49:46] God not the body of a of God it's laying
[49:50] on the
[49:51] throne not the spirit because he can
[49:54] anoint everybody body right that's why
[49:58] the Bible said in the last days said I
[49:59] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh but
[50:02] look at your anointed ones right what
[50:05] they're doing
[50:07] right and a lot of them live better
[50:10] Christian lives than me and you so let's
[50:11] don't talk about it all right
[50:14] yeah yeah but they don't have the
[50:16] message of the hour if it's not
[50:18] quickened in our hearts we don't have
[50:24] it because that new birth that you
[50:28] receive starts as an Earnest the Bible
[50:31] called it that's right a
[50:35] baby
[50:37] right right starts with a
[50:41] baby Desiring the sincere milk of the
[50:48] word why is it that you are not
[50:51] following all kind of doctrines that's
[50:53] around this
[50:54] message
[51:00] and you know what I'm saying the truth
[51:01] you can't argue the point right cuz you
[51:04] see people that are so sweet and humble
[51:06] and good people and and everything but
[51:09] they'll follow every kind of garbage
[51:10] Canin doctr you be thought of and
[51:12] they'll get off of this today and get on
[51:13] another tomorrow
[51:17] right have people in the message you
[51:19] just make one prediction right after the
[51:21] other one this is thus sayith the
[51:23] lord well it didn't happen next week you
[51:25] got another one this is thus sayith the
[51:26] Lord and everybody just run with
[51:33] them where's the Christian supposed to
[51:35] be here
[51:38] right but you see the difference I'm
[51:40] trying to explain the difference in Soul
[51:42] and Spirit
[51:45] okay cuz you can have that anointing on
[51:48] that
[51:54] spirit
[51:56] but if that word down in that Soul ever
[51:58] gets
[52:00] quickened you might as well leave them
[52:02] alone brother around said that's right
[52:04] that's what he said he said if you ever
[52:06] get one touch might leave
[52:10] Al that's what I deal with that Soul or
[52:14] that individual that I'm looking at
[52:17] internets or whatever is looking at a
[52:20] soul of an individual oh my because
[52:22] that's the only way you can have the new
[52:24] birth amen
[52:29] right brother D you don't believe that
[52:31] the Holy Spirit comes down and goes in
[52:33] your
[52:34] soul not just as the Holy Spirit that's
[52:37] right amen exactly right I believe it
[52:40] comes down on you and come down on
[52:42] anointed one same way yep that's
[52:45] right the difference
[52:47] between
[52:50] is the anointed one doesn't hold the
[52:54] word
[52:56] honors it respects it and believes
[52:59] it he lets it get twisted up by every
[53:02] Doctrine a wind of doings you know and
[53:05] how can God make that
[53:10] alive
[53:12] right how can you make a doctorine
[53:14] sister Gail that's not even in the
[53:16] Bible you know a two Soul 7 Thunder virt
[53:20] peris and River Jordan they ain't even
[53:22] in the
[53:23] Bible how can make that alive right that
[53:27] two Soul Doctrine started back there in
[53:29] the when right when we first came in the
[53:32] message is when it had
[53:35] begun and to hear them
[53:39] people and they were saying this is what
[53:41] all of my life I know there's something
[53:43] about
[53:45] this this is what I've been waiting
[53:54] on but see instead of bringing life they
[53:57] brought death
[54:02] right because they never gave
[54:07] birth you remember the quote brother
[54:09] around said false prophets bring what
[54:12] false births true prophets bring true
[54:22] births you say to me he said brother
[54:24] Dale you believe I'm a Christian your
[54:26] confession is what you're saying right
[54:29] mhm
[54:33] right what do you think about
[54:37] it sometimes I think you need a new
[54:40] bir but that's not for me to judge
[54:43] that's right cuz I'm not a judge I'm a
[54:46] preacher of the
[54:49] Gospel see then I can see that there's a
[54:52] body anybody can follow that right but
[54:55] then when that's Soul and Spirit you try
[54:57] to get too close together to you you
[54:59] flopping
[55:01] it and see that to way was what brother
[55:05] Brandon was doing in his early
[55:07] Ministry come on he would say Body Soul
[55:14] spirit and then in other times he'd say
[55:17] Body Spirit soul in the early
[55:22] Ministry and all you got to do to find
[55:24] out what he's talking about you just see
[55:26] the senses
[55:28] right outside's always got the five
[55:31] second Realms always got the five the
[55:34] cims only got one Faith or
[55:40] doubt you're either born again or you're
[55:42] not born
[55:44] again but you see then that way we can
[55:47] see what really did happen God had to
[55:50] come down in flesh right right had to
[55:54] mhm not to just anoint the people n it
[55:57] was already there
[56:00] amen amen that's why I've always said it
[56:02] about
[56:05] John what would you have done if you was
[56:07] John the
[56:10] Baptist bless God I just jump right in
[56:13] there you run up thereus and you look at
[56:17] him
[56:19] and there's a holy spirit on the man
[56:22] M that's right
[56:26] come
[56:28] on did wouldn't it
[56:30] cus that said it was
[56:33] necessary that one die for the sins of
[56:37] the
[56:42] people what you done if you John walking
[56:45] up did you see those things happen
[56:48] cu the Run said to her s Saul was he
[56:51] said he go down there he said get under
[56:53] the spirit he said it be on all that he
[56:56] listed with the
[57:00] prophets
[57:05] cus was he a dirty mean
[57:09] guy now they've killed
[57:15] him but he was speaking in the first
[57:17] person really in the for what he was say
[57:19] that it was necessary that one die for
[57:21] their sin now you can turn around and
[57:22] don't worry about it I know all about
[57:24] them thing cuz Satan talks to me
[57:27] too you say well what he meant
[57:30] was it's necessary that that one die for
[57:34] to keep us from all having to
[57:37] die I don't go that way because brother
[57:40] Brown said cus under the
[57:44] anointing said it was
[57:47] necessary CU he was quoting
[57:51] scripture but he couldn't get the new
[57:53] birth
[57:56] the great
[57:57] Nicodemus that would defend the Lord
[57:59] Jesus great gamea that would say you're
[58:03] happily to be fighting against God you
[58:04] better leave it
[58:10] alone but yet they couldn't receive that
[58:12] new
[58:16] birth said there's no record CER I mean
[58:19] Nicodemus or DEA ever received a new
[58:22] birth but he said they'll be given
[58:24] eternal life because of their stand up
[58:27] for the
[58:28] gospel wonderful God
[58:33] Amen see I'm trying to just take a
[58:36] simple little thing in your own
[58:38] life to let you
[58:42] see that have the new
[58:45] birth you can see the difference in Soul
[58:48] and
[58:50] Spirit amen that's
[58:53] right because you know know there was a
[58:56] day you Lov the
[58:58] Lord you went to church you were happy
[59:01] when you first heard the message
[59:04] maybe but then one day you realized you
[59:06] wasn't born
[59:09] again you ever come to
[59:12] that you realize you wasn't born again
[59:15] right amen that's right and there's a
[59:19] lot of difference between the spirit and
[59:20] the
[59:22] Soul now once they're together in an
[59:24] individual we're going to get into the
[59:26] question here in a minute about it once
[59:28] they're together in an individual who's
[59:29] trying to be a
[59:34] Christian but R said all of those memory
[59:37] reason conscience and things are all
[59:40] right if they're lined up with the
[59:43] word the Bible says come let us reason
[59:50] together you said but we're supposed to
[59:52] cast down reasoning
[59:55] we're supposed to cast down Satan's
[59:57] reasoning right not God's
[1:00:05] reasoning come on you talk to God he
[1:00:07] comes down he's got a reason with you to
[1:00:10] a degree cuz he got to get through them
[1:00:12] right and I don't understand how he can
[1:00:14] do it you talk about talking about a
[1:00:17] great God when I look at me and you and
[1:00:20] I think about how that God some way in
[1:00:23] the world came down through my brain
[1:00:26] through my senses of
[1:00:29] hearing and then went on into the
[1:00:31] reasoning factors that brother Brandon
[1:00:33] said them flu was what was plugged up in
[1:00:36] the
[1:00:37] garden the flu of memory reason
[1:00:40] conscience and all in the
[1:00:42] garden and yet God can come all the way
[1:00:45] through
[1:00:48] there and speak to her soul
[1:00:53] amen
[1:00:55] that's an amazing thing amen
[1:01:00] right you said well brother D you
[1:01:02] definitely believe difference in Soul
[1:01:04] and Spirit I definitely do yes
[1:01:05] absolutely amen I do definitely believe
[1:01:10] amen but then I believe that we get them
[1:01:12] all back together
[1:01:17] right and then when we do get it all
[1:01:19] back together we can
[1:01:22] realize R around and say that the nature
[1:01:24] of the spirit is God if you're born
[1:01:28] again he said the nature of your
[1:01:31] soul he says soul is the nature of
[1:01:33] spirit spirit's the nature of
[1:01:36] Soul
[1:01:39] yeah cuz if we're born
[1:01:42] again we should not have the spirit of
[1:01:44] the
[1:01:47] world we should have the spirit of
[1:01:50] God right amen right if you see what I'm
[1:01:54] talking about that 120 sitting in that
[1:01:56] upper
[1:01:59] room all of the anointing had
[1:02:04] left amen come on you agree with me they
[1:02:10] got in that upper room all the anointing
[1:02:13] of the ministry was gone CU Jesus told
[1:02:15] him don't do that no
[1:02:17] more go in that room and
[1:02:20] wait man and they were down and
[1:02:23] out
[1:02:25] until brother random expresses that one
[1:02:27] of them got up and said I think we're
[1:02:29] dist by
[1:02:31] faith Peter one other of said nope he
[1:02:35] said stay here until and we ain't got
[1:02:37] what he
[1:02:41] had CU go we're
[1:02:45] scared do you want to go out John run
[1:02:48] out there go tell them about
[1:02:52] Jesus I'm not going
[1:02:56] cuz see Jesus wouldn't will him to take
[1:02:58] care of them
[1:03:01] right when that Holy Ghost came come on
[1:03:06] Amen the same man that had went up and
[1:03:09] come back went out the door and the
[1:03:12] people called a
[1:03:13] bride Amen in their soul amen right was
[1:03:18] the very soul of almighty God right the
[1:03:21] very person of his being not just an
[1:03:24] anointing come on all right man the very
[1:03:28] God of Glory walked out of that upper
[1:03:31] room right and went right down and said
[1:03:34] you men and
[1:03:36] Brethren this is right said go out there
[1:03:39] and took the horns and call them yeah
[1:03:41] we'll preach to them now yeah but we're
[1:03:43] not afraid yeah
[1:03:47] right because they can't touch us until
[1:03:50] he gets through with us that's right cuz
[1:03:53] we've seen a man treat years in a half
[1:03:56] that we've walked with him that they
[1:03:57] couldn't lay hands on him that's right
[1:04:00] right you just walk out in the midst of
[1:04:02] them right that's
[1:04:06] true they couldn't get to
[1:04:08] it and said well we might not believe a
[1:04:11] lot but if that same thing is in here
[1:04:14] then I'm Not
[1:04:17] Afraid are you afraid of what you
[1:04:21] believe now I'm going to make a
[1:04:23] statement I know hard
[1:04:25] but you know the biggest portion of
[1:04:27] preachers of this message won't tell you
[1:04:29] what to
[1:04:30] believe
[1:04:34] true that's right they try to get you to
[1:04:37] believe it by
[1:04:40] sual
[1:04:41] things is that the correct word sual
[1:04:44] deceiving
[1:04:46] orinal okay y'all pronounce
[1:04:51] correct to get to word it
[1:04:55] brother dick caught on to what I'm
[1:04:57] believing oh Lord go tell him about it
[1:05:00] brother dick
[1:05:03] yeah but you see I
[1:05:08] believe if you take out that soul out of
[1:05:12] any man on this
[1:05:15] Earth You know any
[1:05:18] man Christian or he's
[1:05:22] dead that's right
[1:05:25] yep because he's a unit
[1:05:29] MH you take that Spirit part out of
[1:05:34] him you
[1:05:38] de your body can't operate without the
[1:05:40] spirit right and the spirit can't be
[1:05:43] what it is supposed to
[1:05:46] be without the soul that's right right
[1:05:49] no he didn't it'd be another dog
[1:05:51] right right right monkey keep cat
[1:05:56] horse keep on it'll start
[1:05:59] talking and teach them to
[1:06:02] talk keep on keep on keep on get them to
[1:06:08] count no
[1:06:10] difference that Soul that's in
[1:06:13] you is so
[1:06:15] valuable God didn't die now listen
[1:06:18] closely he didn't die for this
[1:06:23] body that's involved yes come on he
[1:06:28] didn't die for the spirit that's within
[1:06:30] you right he died for that Soul that's
[1:06:36] in
[1:06:38] you then what is it body to body he's my
[1:06:42] brother right come on is I am I in the
[1:06:45] scripture that he wouldn't have a
[1:06:48] problem calling us Brethren y right in
[1:06:50] the scripture right body to body e my
[1:06:52] brother right
[1:06:55] Spirit to
[1:06:58] Spirit he's an anointing of God yep the
[1:07:02] love the joy the peace the
[1:07:05] goodness the soul to soul he's my savior
[1:07:12] amen n than New
[1:07:17] Birth that's why you don't see me like
[1:07:19] everybody else preaching and hollering
[1:07:22] and doing this that and the other I just
[1:07:24] keep right on
[1:07:28] preaching he said well brother Dale and
[1:07:30] I know I've been told a lot of times
[1:07:31] said you need to let up a little bit
[1:07:32] you're too
[1:07:37] deep I'm
[1:07:41] not brother Ram would stand there and
[1:07:43] preach the
[1:07:46] seals and hundreds would weep their way
[1:07:48] to the
[1:07:52] altar
[1:08:00] right Spirit to Spirit I can get you in
[1:08:02] the
[1:08:04] altar I know how to do
[1:08:07] it Spirit to Spirit I can get in your
[1:08:17] bill you know what I mean by
[1:08:20] that
[1:08:22] sure
[1:08:24] but if I'm talking to your
[1:08:26] soul I ain't worried about the other
[1:08:29] part right
[1:08:31] Amen brother Dale don't you think he
[1:08:33] need to preach what these bodies is
[1:08:37] doing ain't never converted nobody
[1:08:45] yet come on am I in the Bible or not the
[1:08:49] Bible said the goodness of God is what
[1:08:51] leads you to repentance it don't say
[1:08:52] beat you over the head
[1:08:58] if you're not
[1:09:00] condemned in your
[1:09:07] soul come
[1:09:08] on you ain't going to never become a
[1:09:11] Christian that's
[1:09:14] right word say condemned in your spirit
[1:09:16] condemned in your
[1:09:19] body go right on make a good
[1:09:21] neighbor fill up to church use and pile
[1:09:25] the money
[1:09:29] in pay the parking lot cuz you're going
[1:09:31] to get to have on count of
[1:09:34] that that's what you
[1:09:38] think you see where preachers are
[1:09:41] making Christians in the spirit
[1:09:44] real
[1:09:46] right they're not preaching into the
[1:09:48] souls of the
[1:09:49] individual that's right amen
[1:09:54] is it that they don't know what a soul
[1:10:00] is
[1:10:02] amen now with that in
[1:10:08] mind let's take a couple of questions
[1:10:10] and then we'll
[1:10:11] quit we're probably going to be on
[1:10:13] question and answer Sunday again but
[1:10:16] that's all right all right amen all
[1:10:19] right we got up to the point that said
[1:10:20] when someone dies it sounds like they're
[1:10:23] divid the body goes one place the body
[1:10:25] go Spirit goes another Soul goes it
[1:10:28] does the prophet of God emphatically
[1:10:30] States
[1:10:32] what the spirit is released from God
[1:10:34] goes to the soul so or which way will
[1:10:37] bring it and
[1:10:38] SWOT Spirit release come to the soul
[1:10:41] soul to the body stand on Earth amen
[1:10:44] Soul release come to the Spirit come to
[1:10:46] the body stand upon Earth and
[1:10:49] resurrect see we can get all tied up in
[1:10:51] why the words are swappy
[1:10:56] but just remember one simple
[1:11:01] Story one simple thing there's five
[1:11:05] senses down
[1:11:07] there that Spirit real with the
[1:11:09] individual that go somewhere when you
[1:11:15] die it has the memory love that thanks
[1:11:19] to the
[1:11:22] soul yep
[1:11:24] and that's where even I was missing it
[1:11:25] years ago preached on it for many many
[1:11:29] years and I couldn't see that Soul had
[1:11:32] any sense other than Faith or
[1:11:36] doubt then I got to dig it into the
[1:11:39] word I found out the prophet when they
[1:11:42] was beyond the curtain of time that was
[1:11:44] Souls under the altar of those
[1:11:47] individuals and they had memory reason
[1:11:51] conscience affections
[1:11:55] his old horse was there his
[1:12:03] dog see then I begin to dig and I said
[1:12:05] Lord there's something different here
[1:12:07] now this man's explaining
[1:12:10] something I always just believe that
[1:12:12] that Soul could just be Faith or doubt
[1:12:14] either born again or
[1:12:16] not but you see every person their
[1:12:19] soul is their individuality of
[1:12:22] themselves and whether you're lost or
[1:12:24] saved that's the next point we got the
[1:12:27] soul of the Lost are in a different
[1:12:30] dimension so they are The Souls of the
[1:12:33] Lost is not in the dimension the prophet
[1:12:35] said The Sinner dead is in The Fifth
[1:12:37] Dimension the Christian is in the sixth
[1:12:40] that's right different dimensions all
[1:12:43] right but that soul of that person in
[1:12:48] hell you remember the Rich Young the
[1:12:50] Rich Young
[1:12:52] Ruler
[1:12:54] he lift up his eyes in hell so we could
[1:12:59] see he said I'm
[1:13:03] thirsty his body wasn't down there
[1:13:07] right Des send the Temple of
[1:13:14] water he saying that he was still
[1:13:18] conscious of a
[1:13:20] God cuz you'll never lose that doesn't
[1:13:23] matter what
[1:13:24] whether your hot and tots in Africa
[1:13:26] whatever it is that knowledge that
[1:13:28] Consciousness and he said send somebody
[1:13:30] back send
[1:13:32] Elijah they didn't speak to my
[1:13:35] brothers said he wanted to get a a
[1:13:38] Salvation campaign
[1:13:41] started TR to help his brothers right
[1:13:44] and he was in
[1:13:47] hell that was that
[1:13:51] Soul see then if we can realize that
[1:13:53] soul of that individual has all of those
[1:13:57] senses right this is the way brother R
[1:14:00] said it and you've heard it because I
[1:14:01] give it to you many times he said a
[1:14:03] greater eyesight than what we have amen
[1:14:07] that's right he said a greater
[1:14:09] hearing than what we
[1:14:12] have you didn't leave it just little
[1:14:15] minute things that soul is
[1:14:20] greater cuz you explain to me what you
[1:14:22] see
[1:14:28] well brother what do you mean want to
[1:14:29] see what I see my
[1:14:33] eyeballs man if you're in Gams with
[1:14:35] years ago they told a story and youve
[1:14:37] heard of many
[1:14:38] others they take the guy they drove
[1:14:41] around the
[1:14:42] city they take his eyes up and he drove
[1:14:44] the
[1:14:51] city you want to argue with those points
[1:14:54] well I wouldn't die and I couldn't see
[1:14:55] it well it's good you got a good
[1:14:57] argument you die and go to hell that
[1:14:59] type of argument
[1:15:02] too but you see you can take a man's
[1:15:04] eyesight away who was it coin coin was
[1:15:07] his name the man in the Pentecostal
[1:15:09] thing brother tat them you about it
[1:15:11] brother M didn't knew about
[1:15:14] it had no
[1:15:17] eyeball had one eye didn't have no
[1:15:19] eyeball in the socket they take up his
[1:15:22] eye close it up can
[1:15:27] read you say well I see with my eyeball
[1:15:30] no you see with your brain
[1:15:35] right that's what science
[1:15:39] says and your brain is motivated by your
[1:15:44] spirit it is not your
[1:15:47] spirit
[1:15:49] right your brain is no more than a
[1:15:51] thumping gizzard or a recorder or a
[1:15:56] computer but that spirit is what
[1:15:58] motivates it
[1:16:01] right but that Soul inside of you is one
[1:16:03] that serves One belongs after
[1:16:07] God see that's why that when you even no
[1:16:10] matter
[1:16:12] what and it went on the question was to
[1:16:15] go with that one the soul of the Lost
[1:16:16] are in a different dimension uh the
[1:16:19] theophonic form experiencing torment CU
[1:16:22] that's what they do
[1:16:24] um
[1:16:25] thirsting had body senses had memory of
[1:16:29] a brother to send someone back MH and
[1:16:34] said don't they have a knowledge of
[1:16:35] having missed salvation I think by then
[1:16:38] they have a knowledge they something
[1:16:39] wrong right maybe they don't fully
[1:16:42] understand it they missed
[1:16:44] everything cuz once that person comes
[1:16:46] back to judgment and stands there you'll
[1:16:48] stand there and say have not I cast out
[1:16:50] devils in now
[1:16:52] name
[1:16:58] now I like this one so I'll try to
[1:16:59] explain it it'll take 15
[1:17:03] minutes said aren't the souls under the
[1:17:07] altar in the presence of
[1:17:12] God there's two in here on the presence
[1:17:14] of God so it it's dealing with the same
[1:17:19] point up and down so I just take it as
[1:17:21] one so under the
[1:17:24] altar in the presence of
[1:17:28] God
[1:17:34] now brother randam when he went beyond
[1:17:36] the curtain of time he wanted to see
[1:17:40] Jesus right the angel of the Lord Holy
[1:17:44] Spirit there with him told him
[1:17:46] said he's higher you can't see
[1:17:52] him so what is the presence of
[1:17:56] God it just like how many Heavens are
[1:17:58] there the Bible said there heavens of
[1:18:02] Heavens right heaven to us in the
[1:18:05] natural is the clouds that's atmosperic
[1:18:09] or what you call it out here you
[1:18:12] know then brother R said the first
[1:18:14] Heaven would be the
[1:18:17] Millennium so the first heaven we talk
[1:18:19] about is just natural heavens of mankind
[1:18:25] so is it with the presence of
[1:18:29] God I don't believe any
[1:18:33] person I hope you was catching on to
[1:18:35] that the other day on the dimensions and
[1:18:37] in that sixth Dimension they got to be
[1:18:39] different different overlays or whatever
[1:18:42] cubicles whatever you want to call them
[1:18:43] just you make it up that's all
[1:18:46] right sections
[1:18:49] positions as the question was that does
[1:18:52] your your belief make you a position we
[1:18:55] see I preached that as being a position
[1:18:59] right and see then in heaven they would
[1:19:02] have to be seven dimensional parts of
[1:19:04] the sixth
[1:19:06] Dimension maybe that's the wrong way of
[1:19:08] saying it but you need to be sections or
[1:19:10] whatever because you have to have one
[1:19:12] for his church age righten then you'd
[1:19:15] have to have one for the foolish virgins
[1:19:17] that has died down through those ages
[1:19:19] because I can't see that you C them
[1:19:21] their soul doesn't go to
[1:19:24] torment you know the hell or
[1:19:29] right the regions of the Lost I'm just
[1:19:32] honest I can't if I'm wrong I'm wrong I
[1:19:35] just can't see it that
[1:19:36] way so there would have to be a presence
[1:19:39] of
[1:19:40] God we come to church a lot of times and
[1:19:43] we come here
[1:19:47] and and we sing and we worship and we
[1:19:51] feel the presence of God
[1:19:54] sometimes we sing and worship and don't
[1:19:56] feel his pres
[1:19:58] right that's a way of describing his
[1:20:01] presence so those in The Fifth Dimension
[1:20:05] would not be in the presence of God or
[1:20:07] even in their thoughts brother R said
[1:20:09] hell is not burning he said really it's
[1:20:12] a falling right he said because there's
[1:20:14] no bottom to it right see it ain't got
[1:20:17] no word to Foundation it right you know
[1:20:19] it's just
[1:20:20] falling he said a burning hell would be
[1:20:22] a
[1:20:26] pleasure but there's no such thing as
[1:20:28] that being the presence of God that's
[1:20:31] absence of God
[1:20:33] right that's what it was in the garden
[1:20:36] when Cain went out from the presence of
[1:20:38] the Lord right had he stayed at the
[1:20:39] Garden he'd been
[1:20:42] okay he might have found out what the
[1:20:44] sacrifice
[1:20:47] was but you see it's one of those places
[1:20:49] of those churches down to the ages of
[1:20:52] seven churches ages and the the foolish
[1:20:54] virgin would even have to have
[1:20:56] a positional form that you can say
[1:21:00] that's the presence of
[1:21:05] God but then we have the fifth seal Jew
[1:21:08] and the Old Testament Saints and 144,000
[1:21:12] and
[1:21:13] things and we can say that they're in
[1:21:15] the presence of
[1:21:17] God because they were there in the filth
[1:21:20] Ste and said it was told God told them
[1:21:22] or somebody told them a presence of God
[1:21:25] was with those FAL Jews in Revelation
[1:21:29] 6 told him to rest a little while until
[1:21:32] your brother so you call out a presence
[1:21:34] of
[1:21:39] God but the bride under the
[1:21:42] altar you know the soul brother Rand
[1:21:45] went and saw under the altar in a
[1:21:47] different that was a greater presence
[1:21:51] than any of the others could possess
[1:21:54] yes but yet Jesus wasn't
[1:21:58] there because the plan wouldn't
[1:22:01] finished and I was trying to preach the
[1:22:03] other day the Redemption plan would
[1:22:06] finished he left that for you and I to
[1:22:11] preach wa we get to the seventh
[1:22:13] seal he left up for you and I to preach
[1:22:16] that's right we are to preach the Plan
[1:22:18] of Redemption for the entire
[1:22:21] being am amen Body Spirit and
[1:22:25] soul and that will bring a presence of
[1:22:28] God
[1:22:31] here that will take us there right and
[1:22:35] we meet him in the air so it's not his
[1:22:37] physical
[1:22:41] presence see then brother ROM couldn't
[1:22:43] go up into the presence of God
[1:22:46] right I know church I know I'm in
[1:22:49] trouble already takes
[1:22:51] M that's why why
[1:22:55] those Old Testament Saints when they
[1:22:57] went
[1:22:59] up they went in the presence of God
[1:23:05] right but I don't believe they went into
[1:23:08] the presence of God
[1:23:10] higher right than brother Brandon was
[1:23:13] representing when he went right and that
[1:23:15] John went up in Revelations
[1:23:21] 4
[1:23:24] I just can't follow that that they were
[1:23:26] there the Old Testament Saints was
[1:23:27] raised in Mortal bodies and made Eternal
[1:23:31] right I can't go I'm
[1:23:33] sorry one day you'll learn what I'm
[1:23:35] talking
[1:23:37] about CU I have to stand
[1:23:40] alone I have to preach
[1:23:43] alone that's always been
[1:23:46] me have nothing against
[1:23:50] nobody but I just kind of stay with what
[1:23:52] I believe now if you show me I'm wrong
[1:23:55] I'll be glad to accept
[1:23:59] it but you going to have to bring it for
[1:24:01] the Lord and let him bring it to
[1:24:05] me it's got to come from him right thank
[1:24:09] he take it just because anybody say so
[1:24:13] what is being under the altar in the
[1:24:15] presence of
[1:24:17] God is that where God
[1:24:21] is
[1:24:23] if you understand what I'm saying those
[1:24:24] fifth no uh foolish virgins wouldn't be
[1:24:28] in hell no they're in the presence of
[1:24:34] God but they're not in the position of
[1:24:36] the
[1:24:38] Bride the fif seal Jew is in the
[1:24:40] presence of God but not in the presence
[1:24:43] of God like the
[1:24:46] bride the Old Testament Saints are in
[1:24:48] the presence of God but not like the
[1:24:51] bride
[1:25:03] when Samuel was brought up now this a
[1:25:06] question or statement question Samuel
[1:25:08] was brought up by the witch of
[1:25:11] Endor he knew why God didn't answer
[1:25:15] Saul he had What's
[1:25:20] called the present
[1:25:22] our presence of mind you know thoughts
[1:25:26] of mind sure he had
[1:25:29] that he knew
[1:25:31] why Saul wouldn't get an answer from God
[1:25:36] he was a
[1:25:38] prophet he was still in that position
[1:25:41] sure doing that right let me run fast
[1:25:44] through this
[1:25:46] okay when God created Adam in theophany
[1:25:49] form Genesis
[1:25:51] 1:26 he spoke to Adam giving
[1:25:54] him
[1:25:57] information that Adam received you
[1:25:59] remember he named
[1:26:02] anal he understood what God was
[1:26:05] saying Adam
[1:26:09] could said could this be reasoning of
[1:26:12] the spirit
[1:26:18] sense
[1:26:21] no
[1:26:25] now Genesis 1:26 man is not not a spirit
[1:26:28] man now come on I know you going to know
[1:26:31] the quotes you know the quotes okay you
[1:26:32] got it go around call him a spirit man
[1:26:35] but you better go on and read a little
[1:26:36] bit and he called him spiritual
[1:26:41] be Genesis 1:26 man is not a creation of
[1:26:45] God of a spirit to come in and anoint
[1:26:47] you no
[1:26:50] right Genesis 1:26 man is the theophany
[1:26:53] Y
[1:26:57] amen he just put that in 27 and that man
[1:27:00] on Earth had eternal
[1:27:02] life because that theophany and God had
[1:27:05] eternal
[1:27:07] life so when the 126 was put into to 27
[1:27:11] now you got Adam on
[1:27:15] Earth as an eternal person but his body
[1:27:18] wasn't
[1:27:19] Eternal right
[1:27:24] are the spirits are are the Saints under
[1:27:27] the altar redeemed back to
[1:27:32] 126 sounds
[1:27:35] good but have to say
[1:27:38] no unless you're talking about the
[1:27:42] bride now when you're using Saints under
[1:27:44] the altar as
[1:27:48] bride you correct that's
[1:27:51] right but if you're using it as the
[1:27:54] fifth seal Jew and and even the 144,000
[1:27:58] or whatever they will never have the
[1:28:01] Genesis 126 man
[1:28:06] right even though they have eternal life
[1:28:13] right that 126 man is at theing of
[1:28:16] almighty God Amen that's right right
[1:28:18] which is the
[1:28:20] soul of God
[1:28:24] that soul of God was put in a man called
[1:28:27] Adam
[1:28:31] right cuz he was Body Spirit and soul
[1:28:34] Adam right but then that theoy soul of
[1:28:38] almighty God come into Adam and gave him
[1:28:40] eternal life right in his
[1:28:46] soul Those Old Testament
[1:28:49] Saints are giv eternal life
[1:28:52] the FI Shield you is given eternal life
[1:28:57] the 144,000 even receive eternal life
[1:29:02] here right but they'll never be the
[1:29:04] bride right that's right they'll never
[1:29:07] be the one 26
[1:29:11] man they can never
[1:29:14] say and listen to
[1:29:17] me they can never say let us make man
[1:29:23] in our own
[1:29:25] image
[1:29:28] than you catch
[1:29:33] it foolish virgins are given eternal
[1:29:37] life but they can never
[1:29:39] say let us make man that's right the 126
[1:29:45] man was a Creator
[1:29:49] God that's why brother brother say it
[1:29:51] you have within you the ability to
[1:29:55] create a world and go live on
[1:29:59] it but it's controlled by the law of
[1:30:05] God nobody but the bride if I'm wrong I
[1:30:08] want to know
[1:30:11] it even though those people are put in
[1:30:15] flesh all of those people that we Nam
[1:30:19] the Old Testament Saints 144,000 the pH
[1:30:21] you the foolish virgin even though they
[1:30:24] one day will stand in eternal life in
[1:30:26] Soul and
[1:30:28] body but they'll never be the
[1:30:31] bride that's
[1:30:35] right they'll never be the 126 man he
[1:30:39] said but you have to give them the
[1:30:41] soul it's all
[1:30:43] right I don't have no problems with
[1:30:47] you but I know what eternal life
[1:30:50] is the Bible said eternal life is in his
[1:30:55] son right eternal life is in his
[1:31:03] son and that's what we are that's
[1:31:06] right you remember here while back when
[1:31:08] I tried to explain
[1:31:10] it sure you can explain it like we're
[1:31:13] talking about Dimension like we talking
[1:31:14] about presence you can
[1:31:18] explain that when we receive eternal
[1:31:20] life we become the children of
[1:31:23] God
[1:31:26] yep but we're not called
[1:31:29] bride oh we're just
[1:31:31] babies
[1:31:32] right one day we can be called a
[1:31:38] bride then a day can come that we can be
[1:31:40] called his
[1:31:42] wife that's
[1:31:44] right we can ain't the end of the
[1:31:50] story we can be called his
[1:31:53] offspring yep his
[1:32:02] family but the Bible says it come a time
[1:32:04] when you be known as your
[1:32:09] known listen Church there is no word
[1:32:12] that I've ever Ted in any form that
[1:32:17] because you progress in stages upward
[1:32:19] that you do away with anything behind
[1:32:21] you
[1:32:22] if you're thinking that you got a carnal
[1:32:24] mind and you really miss what brother
[1:32:26] Dale what to try tried to say for 40
[1:32:29] something
[1:32:30] years we will always be his
[1:32:34] babies your little children
[1:32:39] right John in the writings of John look
[1:32:41] at him I write unto your children I
[1:32:45] write unto
[1:32:46] you young
[1:32:48] adults I Rite unto you fathers he was
[1:32:51] speaking to three different groups of
[1:32:56] people but you can never be his bride
[1:32:59] unless you're first his child right you
[1:33:03] can never be his wife until you're his
[1:33:06] bride you can never be his offspring if
[1:33:09] you're not all of those other
[1:33:13] things
[1:33:15] see he said when you trying to make us
[1:33:17] something special amen I wish I had the
[1:33:20] words
[1:33:22] to explain that
[1:33:25] amen amen it ain't going to be when we
[1:33:27] get to Heaven There ain't going to be no
[1:33:29] God come you're you're you're dumb if
[1:33:32] you think I'm talking that
[1:33:36] way when we get
[1:33:40] there the Bible says we will be like him
[1:33:43] right
[1:33:45] right he'll always be my
[1:33:49] father but at the same time he's my
[1:33:51] brother
[1:33:52] now you explain that
[1:33:54] one you explain that he'll always be my
[1:33:57] brother but he'll always be my
[1:34:00] father I can always call him
[1:34:03] daddy but he can call me
[1:34:08] wife I've got in trouble trying to
[1:34:10] explain
[1:34:11] that that you men think you're something
[1:34:14] cause you
[1:34:17] MN door in the body your feminist
[1:34:24] right that's right you don't want to be
[1:34:30] finished not this
[1:34:38] kind but you want to be his wife right
[1:34:43] man you can't explain
[1:34:50] that but if you you can see it you can
[1:34:53] see how he can be father son Holy Ghost
[1:34:56] healer
[1:34:57] deliverer Advocate amen
[1:35:02] comforter he can be all of that
[1:35:05] right and yet be
