========================================

honoring their mother on Mother's Day so thank good to have mothers that are alive huh on that passed on boy memories good things to have mommies are special they're different they got a lot to do you see in the paper this morning there a couple in Banks County just had four little girls four girl and they had them all in the paper they're what 3 months old two months born in January January yeah and they were the cutest things mon he had two with bottle she had two with bottle tell you what that' be a full-time job that's not fun one that wouldn't be fun that's not fun okay no that's where no West we com in all right now let's go to Revelation 6 we're going to justk God we're just going to review today you got that on we're just going to review today since we got a lot out and U all right come back back play you play [Music] he [Applause] well Gwen and Joe and her mom and another friend are traveling they're on Cru going to Yep they're going to S the Caribbean so good to good to be able to do that so all right let's just let's just we're going to uh um just go over what we have previously caught on the four seal and then to uh not now next Sunday um Bob come to next Sunday I kind of forgot I was going to let y'all do them in between but uh you got you got it next Sunday brother Ernie will be here so we'll all be under anticipation of that so you do Sunday school and then the next time we have it we're going to start on the fifth seal so now we've got one 2 three and four right yeah all right we got to the four still and and obviously there's five six and seven but as we've shown before we can break this down into parts and it and you can understand it a lot better right okay cuz if you go see you can go here you look justification sanctification the Holy Ghost and then the word the word at its Capstone Revelation all the way up but that for seal look it took a prophet and tell us that there's nowhere in that for seal that tells us there's going to be a Rapture nowhere right it doesn't plainly say and after the fourth seal the Rapture is going to take the Gentile bride up no but when the prophet and look how simple it is though he's on the fourth seal well he gets to the fifth seal and the angel says well where's the combat be in other words I'm just saying that's what happened because brother BR didn't know it right he didn't know what the fifth seal was he said he did because I don't think that the angel that brought him the revelation of those seal or brought him the the word for the seal he couldn't reveal it to him cuz it was an angel Jesus Christ had to reveal it to him through his new birth so the angel couldn't say now the Rapture is going to take place on the four seal the prophet would say well how you know that in other words all he'd have to do is say look in the fifth seal and do you see any combat Beast now you being a prophet you know that combat Beast is what the Holy Ghost in The Believer right right the combat Beast actually the combat Beast is all the way from here to here right and then takes you all the way up what I'm saying is you got you lion ox man and Eagle that's the whole bride right that's not just us that's the whole bride of Jesus Christ from the day of Pentecost till the day we go home all right so now just in plain language if you don't see those combat beefs anymore then they must have went somewhere and we know if they're Eternal they didn't didn't die right they went somewhere right right right cuz they disappeared so the here is God through all the church agers through the L man and eagle and then all of a sudden they disappear well it's they is not the Lono man and Eagle they is the bride that the liono man and Eagle is working through so he comes up to the fifth seal and you know the angel could say well William brandom what' he say and he could have said I you know scratched his head well I I don't know anything about this he said well where's your combat be and being a prophet he absolutely first thing he put the word together and said Somebody's missing okay somebody's missing in this next seal that was in these other four something's missing so there must be something take place so then brother ban said take place when the for and that's exactly correct right but now look cuz we're when we get into five six and seven we must know one thing for sure that something's got to work in a higher order okay not just you know like we said before you got you got baby form justification sanctification and then the baptism of Holy Ghost right all right then you've got justification sanctification baptism of Holy Ghost what in the pyramid yes right then you got justification satification baptism of Holy Ghost in The Believer in The Headstone right okay it's the same justification is just working in a higher in a higher realm more work so then we look here and we take this here and we know what the Rapture takes place then we know this is definitely to the Jews right it's all to the Jews but we know we're gone and nothing in that fifth seal refers to me and you as a natural happening got it natural happening you hear what say now but supernaturally though what's God doing he's taking us right back through and we're going to see justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and remember we got to go into an eight which is what which is the future home why I say future home because see sometimes you can you can argue and say this and it but we know one thing's for sure when we walk in the gates of that future home there is no somebody left here somebody left here somebody left down here somebody left over under there's not of this there's none of that right right that's why I love that message to Future home cuz brother Brown says I've taught justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost since the day I started and he said it looks like this city is going to be come from the same thing all right same three step same three steps all right but you have to look here that you have to add this because remember four is man's number and it's not a good number if you just use the four but if four like Brother D talking about it four death Messengers 1 2 3 4 ate it down are the horse riders right then there's got to be four life Messengers bring it back up and what take us up right so four is not a bad number in Redemption okay what is what is your number four your number four is one two and three mixed together right mixed with faith that's okay brings what the word or the Capstone The Headstone right here but then we must look and see that there's still these now there's not eight seals we know that for a fact right right but remember if you stay sevens is always seven seven 7 seven 7 seven cuz remember Jesus Christ was the seventh seal but he died he had to die so that you and I one day going to see that we don't have to that's right okay and then we're going to go into an eternal rest okay for Earth body All Souls yes all animals all plants all Earth is going to be in Eternal condition that has brought you out of a seven into the eighth day amen now but look you got but you get the eth day back here spiritually in your soul today if you're born again that's your future home you're done it can't go up down sideways it can't even be condemned that's our problem we don't really see what that genesis6 man is I don't think as much as we taught it and preached it and taught it and preached it taught it preached it it's still something that is if we ever see it that's what's going to take us to that body chain yes because in Genesis 126 man has never changed since eternity it's just continued all the way across we're the ones that drop down in time for Redemption purposes right but what if we're going back to we we're going we're doing the timeline not today but in a few weeks but that timeline you got eternity well eternity just as far this way as it is this way we just drop down in time for a little while okay and then we're going to go what go right back up right man fell on the seventh day cuz he wasn't in an eth day right right that right that's right man fell on the seventh day cuz he wasn't in an eighth day now Adam in his soul that's what we're going to talk about this afternoon a little bit Adam and his soul that was the man that that that ruled everything like we talking about Sunday afternoon that man ruled the whole world right storm wind move this over here if he didn't want this island right here he put it right over here the whole island right creative I mean he was a little Creator that's what the problem what what is the number of creation or the number of completion seven is completion seven is completion but you got to remember if you don't go over into that one like brother Dale was talking about if you don't go get in that Eighth Day you got to come out of that seven right that's right see you can be Eternal in a seven seven is completion all the church ages are completed in a seven but they're all dead right the body changes is that Eighth Day yes cuz God never come out of that Eighth Day right he's always been in that in that Eternal you know right condition he's always been an a we got to remember that he's never and he's never changed I U was reading some quotes last night and it's just amazing how the prophet words things and we'll get into them a little bit this afternoon about what Adam did and what Eve cuz remember Eve never got her name until she until the fall right she was Adam right her name was Adam yes when God talked to Adam he talked to Adam and Eve both and he was talking to one person cuz remember June and I or your your husband and wife can be so one and absolutely you share yourself I was telling uh Jun the other day and give you something to laugh about but we've been married 37 years and I uh was delivering mail saw mom and daddy that day too but I was delivering mail wasn't paying no attention so I put mail in the mailbox and I looked up in the mirror and there was this red car com it didn't I didn't see the little yellow lights on top that nny pops old car that's how I tell if start Trailblazer CU you can't see that most TR lasers don't have anyway so I looked back and I didn't see anything so I just put the mail on the mailbox why something just caught my eye and I looked over and this goodlooking girl had pulled right beside of me left the window down and she said what are you doing after work and I about BW a cind I was happy from my day that time so late up in the evening I was happy what are you doing what are you doing after work but you know what but we're that's we're so one and that's wonderful but that has that is not even close to the agape love that we are that that we have with Christ I mean that really that just blew my I was about to have a fit and U still turns me on it ought to be that way y'all not lose that but remember but look June and I never DNA wise will never be one right right humanly will never we share each other we we share everything we have but we're never going to be one but now Adam and Eve when he said she's bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh he meant that she was literally his body that's right made manifest in another form now that's what we got to see with Jesus Christ we got to become the literal body of Jesus Christ cuz if not then we're just another person and we're just we're just infal love we just and a lot of people love the Lord Brother Brown I'll tell you A lot of people love the Lord but they love him and feel your love like we have love for each other but they don't if you love him in agape love that's what that agape love is that's number eight that's an eternal love that never had a beginning never had an end sometimes we don't understand it we have to go through highs and we have to go through lows that's not to say that me and you don't have problems we don't do that every day we don't pull on one side of the road and you know and U and uh proposition each other but we have our bad days but still this right here is not a bad day and a good day though right when we get to that point right body chains living in a cuz remember what I said last Sunday the reason Adam come into the fall was that his flu would stop what do he have to do he started have worrying about a wife he started worrying about children brother I'm we read it we'll read it again I think maybe I may have cut it out business Affairs home Affairs that's what I tell you 80% of the time we live in this world right we think about what money time time to do things work family wife kid daughter son-in-law you understand what I'm saying a lot of that time is wasted and not really wasted but it's put in into our brain that 80% of the time we're not really thinking about God I mean really if you be honest with youself there's only certain times that you'll see something and it'll spark it and you'll but now remember Adam wasn't that way before the fall right so that's what we going we're going back to that point to where we have and Paul told us to have the mind of Christ but you can't have that's why he also said Paul said that a double-minded man is unstable right and we are we're double-minded we have the mind of Christ and we have the mind of the nature that we were born under right the nature of of taking care of four girls and and you know you understand what I'm saying that's why that um that I don't uh I don't see how some of you you know some some sisters have the four kids and but you know Charles and John Wesley had what 19 kids and their mama had to wash clothes and everything else but she sat down and read the Bible with them and she studied with them and all that but um but just telling you the Human Side so we but we got to come out of that Human Side in our thinking and when we do think about God this is what I think about the other thing when we do think or have that 20% of thinking about God it's valuable right it's in Revelation that's right it's not in just you say well I thought about this well you may be thinking about something how many of you have beening fing thinking about something though and God just drop down and and bring it right into what you're thinking and it really not be thinking about it' be a situation or a or thinking about what Christ did for you you know you do something for somebody and then and then God say well that's what I did for you you know that's right so so that's what but that's what we're dealing with but we got to come closer now to the supernatural than we do the natural but really it's not going to change it's probably going to get worse you know down at the squeeze part where we don't have a job we don't have no money we you know what God's going to say you're just like Abraham Abraham thought he could help me during his whole life but when he got down to where he couldn't help me no more he was dead his body was dead he said then Abraham said I can't do it I'm done and that's what we're going to have to do just say look cuz we sat trying to figure things out and we do everybody does everybody say trying to figure things out but forget figuring things out just listen to what the word said all right so now we've got the four life Messengers all right we got the four life Messengers we got the four death Messengers eat it down four life Messengers brought what brought us back to the word under the prophet's message it was so eaten down even in the Pentecostal realm when he did that restoration what he was doing he was restoring right restoration of the Bride tree I think that might be why he preached that message cuz he was restoring the bride yes back to an original condition all right back to what the word and then what's the word got to do the word has got to then take us the rest of the way right cuz you're not going to go back you know you're not going to go back and say well is this justification where I quit smoking drinking cussing not no that justification is when you move into that one you realize once and for all that you never did any of that right that real Genesis 126 man' takes over realiz you'll realize that you never that you never did the things you did listen there's therefore now no condemnation now Paul picked up on something there even in the first church act yes cuz what's our problem we're condemned every day that's right what was the problem with the girl or the sister walking across to get her healing brother BR said Satan condemned her and she didn't get her healing cuz she was a Christian and then he' said you do this you did this you did this prostitute walks across you know what she did the night before she knew she what she did that night she knew what she was going to do the next night that's right but she said I believe what that man says and God had to honor that faith of that prostitute that she believed what that man had said well let's start believing what the man said okay not just in the prayer line let's start believing the the message you know that he brought cuz these seals I'm telling you these seals are are are not for are not for babies right right this is not baby food right this is the this is the um uh prime rib at uh at Texas Roadhouse or or Ruth Chris whatever you know I mean this this is the Meat part and we got to start thinking like that if we don't then then we're going to be left behind amen or we're going to have like Brother D said we have to go by the grave amen which lesson is not and that's what I don't understand people I confess in till the body change but if something happens and and and and I go you know one thing's for sure something I couldn't reach God knew that and he's not going to be he's not going to let his child go on see even in the Old Testament when he let who was um Hezekiah lived 15 more years now I don't believe he'd have done that if it had been a born again child son and daughter of God you understand what I'm saying he takes care of his children now not saying Hezekiah is not going to be there Hezekiah is not his child some we do that we're going what he going to hell no he'll be there cuz he was a prophet in the Old Testament but he didn't have the new birth in his soul right if he had a new birth in his soul it would have been different yes all right so God would have took him home just like he did that brother um Ramsey Ramsey cuz brother Ramsey said a few months later he was gone cuz he didn't want God didn't want him Mar his name what he he didn't let him go 15 years he let him go just a few months that's right to try to straighten up and then took him home yes sir right but you see what I'm saying with all these things we we must realize that as long as we're living and breathing then we can move up into these steps yes even up the statue of a perfect man and even into cuz remember look there's no now don't get me wrong here but listen there's no revelation of the seals from here down okay partial but not full those Seven Seals was that headstone that man Jesus Christ and what he had in his brain not a human brain God's got a brain I hope youall know that yes okay so he he's got a brain that can be in 7even billion places at one time amen so but that's that right there that's getting us back to that Adam condition right here cuz brother R said whatever Adam lost Christ brought us back to and he ain't got to come back to bring it again he brought it all while he was here Jesus ain't got to come back brother ra ain't going to come back Jesus ain't going to come back in the corporate body we know that we meet him in the air then we all come back later on right okay to live through the Thousand-Year Millennium Reign and then then it's going to be the8 day future home everybody got that yes cuz there will be time in the Millennium there will be daylight and dark time A Thousand Years somebody's got to live a th000 years according to the 30-day calendar not the Thousand Years of 36 5 and four right so and I'm not going to sit there with a calendar when we in the Millennium I'm not going to sit there in the calendar and start figuring things out no done we're done with time we're done with we're done with time that's right we're creatures of Eternity right we still have to wear watch though we Twi a time but uh but when we get into that Eighth Day or we're caught up in a revelation now see that's what that's the the whole secret that God has before the foundation of the world he was going to take an eternal thought and bring it into time so he could get the ones out of time and bring them back into eternity to me that's just that's why I said Redemption brother said if you don't forget it he said don't forget that word Redemption why he come out that Eighth Day and come down into our time died resurrected ascended and started pulling his children right back up into that Eighth Day and Paul caught that Revelation he said sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus but it was only a partial remember is a partial Revelation this is not Jesus wasn't partially God right you and I are part God cuz we have a Humanity side that our parents brought yes right all right Jesus was the fullness of the godhead by but now all of us collectively as brother Dale has been preaching all of us collect ly is the fullness of the godhead body gifts callings preachers teachers people with wisdom faith that brings the whole that's what Christ was he was all that together and that's what brought us the headstone came right down here he was rejected remember became the Cornerstone and started building his body back up why he started building the BR tree amen so now as we go through these seals when you see these four horse riders leave now that doesn't mean that Satan left right no cuz in this fifth seal you going to see somebody died and somebody's going to get killed so he's still there but he's not going to be I mean the bride is not going to be in this time period that all right the bride's not going to be here that's right when we get what we're talking about so everything that we talk about right here has got to lap back you heard that word lap over before lap back into here to catch a body chain cuz you can be the word made flesh and your flesh still be getting older and right greater grer but once you come to this eth day cuz that's what we've got to bring I told y'all last Sunday and that's what hit me eternal life is in what is in the Eighth Day right eternal life now we're here stuck in time and death why would that even want to come back here why would that whole six Dimension want to come back into this Dimension where there death death Reigns in this Dimension but when you find a group of people and it may not be but just a few just a little spot in this Dimension yes that brings eternity so real till death like well brother L said this way but you got you got to brush him off death this way you don't bring him on when you brush him off but when you brush death off then what that do that brings them back into this Dimension cuz they got to come back into this Dimension to pick up their bodies they can't get an earth ly body where they're sitting at now right right right they can't brother BR said what he said well we don't either they said we don't need a drink over here that's right we're waiting in other words they're not they and listen they may be in an eighth day and that may be that's their theophany but they're not in a 100% condition that they're supposed to be in okay right their souls under the altar crying how long but not to judge judge and avenge our blood cuz listen they were a human on this earth right yes they got a body laying somewhere they got to come back and pick up so they can eat and drink and enjoy being a human way more than somebody pulling up beside you and saying what you doing after work I mean really former things have pass away behold all things have become new that's right amen we're not going to they're not going to come back into this Dimension and go well we got to go work more well I wonder if uh no now brother told us they come back in the resurrection and we were here for 30 to 40 days you know what he said remember what he said he said God knew they'd want to find out who made it and who didn't so he gave them at 30 and 40 days without him being here and then we're going to be changed and caught up and then we're going to go meet Jesus Christ in the air at 30 to 40 days these people are going to walk around and going you made it you made it you made it how about old Susan well she didn't make you know so no offense to su su but U Joan or but you know you understand but that's what the prophet God said that's right he said that 30 to 40 days he said these people coming back in the resurrection God knew they'd want to know who made it and and re you know re reunite with their families and who made it and who didn't make it they figure all that out and then we go home or we go listen we don't go home right we go to a marriage supper that's not home that's right we we God just rented a banquet hall somewhere you ready cuz that's not our home that's right then when we come back here this is our home potentially but there's still stuff around here that we got that's right amen cuz we judge the 12 tribes amen amen then we come to this is the home we always been looking for is that future home that comes down and when it comes down demons are gone everything swallowed up and as the Bible says Eye Has Not Seen ear is not heard but look we get a glimp of that though yes cuz you know Rapture is just just for a few minutes we talking about the Rapture Rapture is just an it's just because of an event that happened the Rapture will never take place until the Dead come out of the ground so we got to get the dead out of the ground first we got to get that Dimension here then we which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment ey caught up together CAU caught up but Rapture really now you got to remember that word rapture is not always caught up it's it's an it's a euphoric condition Rapture is a condition that everything is just wonderful right right Euphoria just you know that's and what it is hey when we get when we get a body change and we look around and see all this other junk still going on around here and we're changing the moment twk of an ey and caught up out of this to another dimension and let them fight it out over here what a joyous time ain't got to worry about the IRS we ain't got to worry about having money in our pocket we can travel like a thought that's right listen we're not going to go set in a building for three and a half years and just eat no we're going to be the happiest fch people we're going to be all over the place that's right and like I said before even if we could come back into this Dimension it wouldn't hurt us a bit how you going to hurt a glorified body Jesus Christ you know if somebody gets blowed up the angel comes in and takes that soul out it don't bother one bit that's right but in this Dimension when we have this kind of solid Lifetime and matter or life life and matter the prophet said then that's the problem we've come into a dimension that there's boundaries that's right and Jesus had boundaries he never walked through a wall before before the resurrection it was never recorded that he did but bu after the resurrection he be seen over here be seen over here be seen over here and he come right through that concrete and just be as human as as this right here Thomas touch me that's right hold me that's right and that's what brother Brown said he went when he even when he went across a curtain of time even in their theophany condition he can hold them there's a a lot more to that theophany body than than we think what about God we'll read it this afternoon what about God killing two animals and and stripping them of their skin I ain't seen many ghosts do that right it must be somebody that's solid could come down in this Dimension slay two animals pull the skins off of them throw them back in the woods and say here put these on make that covering but that's some things that we need to keep turning around her mind because it's just not white horse riders it's not just red horse riders no this is a scene it's a happening Brother Brown said this is a scene Jans saw a scene that happened same thing Revelation 5 that was a scene what in another dimension he saw a scene of a lamb coming taking a book all right but I believe the lamb when he when he brought these seals he brought the complete plan Plan of Redemption and give it to a prophet has to first cuz the word comes to Prophet first then that Prophet distributes it out and and I was thinking today you know we sometimes we wonder why brother around said the things he did well don't we wonder sometimes what Jesus the things Jesus said I mean it's a hard statement to say eat my flesh and drink my blood and never say anything about it and then you go over there and this guy says well let me go let me go bury my mom he said let the dead bury the dead he said you let you come follow me now that's pretty harsh that's right and all the some of the things that You' seen now that wasn't just well that was the human Jesus no that was he was God Almighty all the time all right he wasn't that's right he didn't slip into a second person or a third person and then he jump back to the first person no he was that was the mind of God sure there was things like let's go eat or what we going to eat today absolutely that's the human part but what's written in that Bible I think the Bible said they was all given for examples everything not just pieces of it was given for examples you read in Paul's writings to timotheus and he talks about the other people and the Saints of the Ephesus and he's writing a letter and you say well that's the Eternal Word of God well it's in there for something for somebody to catch that and and how many times have you read something though and a preacher come in and preach on it and you say I never seen it like that before that's right I mean I'm going back to the little I like the little Gospels Timothy and yes and Titus and John Little John first second third John and I'm reading them now and man you it's just and all it is though is I mean I don't mean that Paul is sitting down and he's going I came to visit you and this is what I saw right right this is what you did and this is what a Christian should do I saw you at and I pray that God will preserve you and he's writing a letter just like I'd write a letter to to to brother Aaron if he was off in another country and God thought so much of that it was his Eternal Word coming down they put it in the Bible I'm sure when Paul was writing that he was writing letter that's right but somebody got a hold of that letter and somebody got connection with the almighty and the almighty says that's U that was me talking that wasn't just Paul that was me talking put that in the Bible hello I mean the 66 books of the Bible is not 67 that's right man has tried to put the book of Judas and the Book of this and the Book of my but see God never but he put them 66 books together and he said here this is what you going to learn from this is what you're going to learn from and if it's Paul talking to Timothy over in Thessalonians to the Thessalonians that's my that's my Eternal Word of God that's me talking to you telling you to go talk to somebody else that's right you understand what I'm saying okay is that all right amen so before we go one more time you got your opening of the seals up to four for and then we take a Rapture combat Beast are gone but we have to lap this back let's get take that out for the moment we got to take these and we got to lap them back over here cuz to the Bride of Jesus Christ we don't get this in its natural form so we must get it in a spiritual form and see the different layers that this justification it's not brother Brown said he said if I didn't rob a bank I'm not guilty that's right right right he now somebody can say I did it remember we'll read it I I can't remember what book it's in but he goes through um you did it and then the real you and then you know you get it the number three we'll read it again and then I mean number two and then number three he goes the real you didn't do it start with he said you said brother you robbed the bank yesterday I wasn't there I didn't do it I was accused of doing it but I wasn't even there so that's the same thing with this justification right here that's not as it no it's as if you didn't do it is number two it's not as if you never did it the real you never did it in first place now when we come to that then you've come into this Revelation that this only does what this inside tells it to do only okay so it's not your flesh is your problem okay now know brother Brown said when God put Adam and Eve in flesh they fell why because they were finally in a form that they couldn't fall Genesis 126 man couldn't fall as long as they stay Spirit man there's no sex involved let's just be plain there's no there's no carnal mind there's no lust it's all um agape love right but he put them in in flesh to what to rule the ground so that some so that the animals could see their leader could see the person this that that they're dealing with the Beast and all that but God knew when he put them in human flesh they were they were going to fall and the flesh only manifested when she got the carnal mind her
