[20:10] you'll just make it mean so much more to
[20:12] us Lord we ask this blessing now in your
[20:17] word now Luke chap 2 verse1 says it's
[20:20] kind of a long reading we'll read the
[20:22] first 20 verses and it came to pass in
[20:26] those days that there went out a decree
[20:27] from Caesar Augustus that all the world
[20:29] should be taxed and this taxing was
[20:32] first made when cenius was governor of
[20:34] Syria and all went to be taxed everyone
[20:36] into his own City and Joseph also went
[20:39] up From Galilee out of the city of
[20:41] Nazareth into Judea into the city of
[20:43] David which is called Bethlehem because
[20:45] he was of the house and lineage of David
[20:48] and if you want to go listen to another
[20:49] good sermon that why little Bethlehem
[20:51] would be a good sermon to listen to to
[20:53] find out why I had to be Bethlehem to be
[20:55] taxed with Mary his espoused wife being
[20:57] great with child and so it was that
[21:00] while they were there the days were
[21:01] accomplished that she should be
[21:02] delivered and she brought forth her
[21:04] firstborn son and wrapped him in
[21:06] swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[21:07] Manger because there was no room for
[21:09] them in the end and they were in the
[21:11] same country shepherds abiding in the
[21:13] field keeping watch over their flock by
[21:15] night and lo the angel of the Lord Came
[21:16] Upon them and the glory of the Lord
[21:18] Shone round about them and they were
[21:19] sore
[21:21] afraid and the angel said unto them fear
[21:23] not for behold I bring you good tidings
[21:26] of great joy which shall shall be to all
[21:30] people uh aren't you glad for that
[21:32] promise tonight anybody can have
[21:35] access for unto you is Born This Day in
[21:38] the city of David a savior which is
[21:40] Christ the lord and this shall be a sign
[21:42] unto you ye shall find the baby wrapped
[21:44] in swaddling clothes lying in a manger
[21:46] and suddenly there was with the angel a
[21:48] multitude of the Heavenly hosts praising
[21:50] God and saying glory to God in the
[21:52] highest and on Earth peace Good Will
[21:54] toward men and it came to pass as the
[21:56] Angels were gone away from them into
[21:58] heaven the Shepherds said one to another
[22:00] let us now go even unto Bethlehem and
[22:02] see this thing which has come to pass
[22:06] which the Lord hath made known unto us
[22:08] and they came with haste and found Mary
[22:10] and Joseph and the Babe lying in a
[22:12] manger and when they had seen it they
[22:15] made known abroad the saying which was
[22:16] told them concerning this child and all
[22:19] they that heard it wondered at those
[22:21] things which were Wonder them by which
[22:22] were told them by the Shepherds but Mary
[22:25] kept all these things and pondered them
[22:27] in her heart
[22:28] and the Shepherds returned glorifying
[22:30] and praising God for all the things that
[22:32] they had heard and seen as it was told
[22:34] unto them you may be seated the Lord had
[22:38] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[22:40] now what a what an interesting story
[22:42] that is that um thank God that it was
[22:45] laid out for us in such detail that we
[22:47] can read all these things about how that
[22:49] the um that God was well think about
[22:52] that that the god that created the world
[22:54] that created that spoke to Moses and
[22:56] manifested in the pillar of five and and
[22:59] uh led the children of Israel out of out
[23:01] of Egypt out of bondage and all those
[23:02] things all the all all of that was
[23:05] bundled up in a little baby there laying
[23:07] in the major all of the things that that
[23:10] unknowable God that they could just kind
[23:12] of probe at that here and there they'
[23:14] get a little glimpse of that Joshua
[23:16] would see a man with a sword drawn in
[23:17] his hand and Moses would get a glimpse
[23:19] of uh uh uh the the backside of a man as
[23:23] he passed by but now he was all bundled
[23:26] up packaged up in that little baby that
[23:28] essence of of of the fullness of God
[23:30] there in that little baby in behind
[23:32] behind skin where you could go and you
[23:34] could hold him and he'd cry and you
[23:36] could touch him and the the fullness of
[23:38] God dwell in that little baby and there
[23:42] out in the field there was there was a
[23:44] bunch of little little Shepherds youd
[23:46] say a bunch of nobodies and isn't it
[23:49] strange that God would bypass all of the
[23:52] you know all the great all the Pharisees
[23:54] and the ones that had been trained up to
[23:55] know uh to be able to recognize that
[23:58] that that the pah was coming to be
[24:00] looking for him and God would bypass all
[24:02] of that and go straight to just a little
[24:04] a little Umble little Shepherd a little
[24:07] group of shepherds out there in the
[24:09] field with um we us say getting dirty uh
[24:13] all the Shepherds with all the all the
[24:15] the sheep with all the dirt and maybe
[24:17] maybe there was a sheep that had to be
[24:19] maybe had a baby that had to be a little
[24:20] lamb had to be delivered that night and
[24:22] they maybe got a little bit messy and
[24:24] things cuz that's how shepherds are
[24:26] shepherds are lowly Shepherds is just
[24:28] the meekest and isn't it strange now
[24:30] brother Brown's typing Shepherds
[24:32] Shepherds with with ministers here and
[24:34] isn't it strange sometimes how the world
[24:37] will hate a shepherd and is't it strange
[24:39] sometimes how how people just they they
[24:41] don't like Shepherds so much I it makes
[24:43] me wonder sometimes what is going on how
[24:46] that just in your natural ability your
[24:48] just human your Humanity you just
[24:50] something greats on people sometimes
[24:52] where I just don't like that well well
[24:55] you know what that's what the Pharisees
[24:56] the the world system they might have
[24:58] looked down at the Shepherds too and
[24:59] been like why why look at those
[25:02] Shepherds they're so dirty and so nasty
[25:05] and nobody would ever pay any any mind
[25:07] to them but God did and God came down
[25:10] and and an Angel that's why I'm titling
[25:13] it the message of an Angel to Shepherds
[25:15] those Shepherds were preaching what the
[25:17] angel told them now isn't that the same
[25:20] thing that's happening in this day the
[25:22] the Shepherds have got a vision that an
[25:24] angel come and told them straight from
[25:26] Heaven an angel a messenger an angel
[25:27] that's what a messenger is a messenger
[25:29] is an angel or an angel is a messenger
[25:32] and they they got uh they got wind they
[25:34] got told by that angel where that they
[25:36] could find God wrapped up and veiled up
[25:40] and bundled up in flesh where they could
[25:42] actually go and see him and look at him
[25:45] and and all they wanted to do they once
[25:48] they heard that once they heard the
[25:49] angel singing and the Angel's message oh
[25:52] they were just consumed with a great
[25:54] desire I got to go see this for myself
[25:56] and they ran and Went to went to
[25:58] Bethlehem and and they searched and
[26:00] found out where that that little baby
[26:02] was and they found it and they saw him
[26:04] and they saw they saw that the thing
[26:06] that had been prophesied all down
[26:08] Through the Ages that now it was laying
[26:10] there and they could see it with their
[26:12] own eyes Now isn't that how the gospel
[26:14] is when you can see it for your own eyes
[26:17] maybe one day you heard about it from a
[26:19] little Street Corner a little little
[26:21] Mission somewhere maybe you heard about
[26:22] it from somebody some little humble
[26:24] Shepherd that the world wouldn't even
[26:26] give nothing to and you heard it preach
[26:28] for yourself and you said I I got to go
[26:30] find out whether this is really true or
[26:33] not something grabbed a hold of your
[26:35] heart and pulled you drew you to himself
[26:39] and you had to go see whether this thing
[26:41] was really true or not and when you saw
[26:44] that it was true you had to go tell
[26:46] somebody else now that's what these
[26:48] Shepherds did they had to go find they
[26:50] had to go into the City and tell
[26:52] everybody I know where the Messiah is oh
[26:56] wasn't that isn't that your confession
[26:58] tonight when you first heard about the
[27:00] message of the hour when you first heard
[27:01] that these things were true that God
[27:04] could actually heal that God could do
[27:06] these things that signs and wonders were
[27:08] being done that the blinded eyes were
[27:10] open that the Mysteries that have been
[27:11] sealed up for ages now were be were
[27:14] revealed and accessible to
[27:17] us and all that heard it wondered at
[27:20] those things which were told them by the
[27:22] Shepherds a bunch of lowly a little
[27:25] group of lowly nobody
[27:28] nobody that that an angel from heaven
[27:30] came and told them where that they could
[27:33] find that little baby laying in a manger
[27:36] and brother B will say why was this
[27:38] great event revealed to Shepherds why
[27:41] was it revealed to Shepherds and not to
[27:43] the theologians of that day they were
[27:45] the one who trained to hear it and why
[27:48] did it come and bypass the rich and come
[27:50] to the poor why did it bypass the
[27:53] learned and wise and come to the humble
[27:56] and unlearned to unlearned untrained
[28:00] uncultured the poorest of all look like
[28:04] the most unfit person for such a task
[28:08] Now isn't that what God does is he'll
[28:10] it's so strange that he'll bypass people
[28:12] that been trained their whole life train
[28:14] their whole life to study study out the
[28:16] Bible and study out all these things but
[28:18] he'll bypass all of that and reveal it
[28:20] to you a little nobody you'll reveal it
[28:23] to somebody that don't know nothing
[28:25] about nothing all they know is the world
[28:27] all you maybe knew about was how to
[28:29] drink a good Coors or drink a Bud Light
[28:31] or something that's all you knew all you
[28:33] knew how to do was smoke a vape or smoke
[28:36] a cigarette or something or go to some
[28:38] beer beer Pub you didn't know nothing
[28:40] about nothing maybe you grew up in the
[28:42] message but you still didn't know
[28:44] nothing about nothing you grew up in a
[28:46] in a message church or grew up around
[28:48] message people but you didn't want it
[28:50] you didn't want it until God called you
[28:53] and pulled of your heart and something
[28:54] began to move and stir and and it wasn't
[28:57] a man that did it it was God begin to
[28:59] draw you just like those Shepherds heard
[29:02] straight from a from Heaven those
[29:04] Shepherds heard from God
[29:06] themselves why was it revealed to
[29:08] Shepherds and not to the theologians of
[29:10] that day they were the one were trained
[29:11] to hear it and brother br will say isn't
[29:13] it strange that it's the lonely The
[29:15] Humble the poor that will receive it
[29:17] before the heady and high-m minded isn't
[29:20] that strange that God wants a little
[29:22] sheep to hear it that God wants to grab
[29:25] get get a somebody that just ain't
[29:26] nothing he said a humble heart God loves
[29:29] if you don't know your ABCs that don't
[29:32] make any difference just a humble heart
[29:35] God dwells in a humble heart not in
[29:37] education it's not in schools not in
[29:40] theology seminaries not in all these
[29:43] other different places not in big words
[29:45] or Not In classical places God dwells in
[29:48] hum in human hearts and the lower you
[29:51] can break yourself down the more simple
[29:54] you can become greater in the sight of
[29:56] God
[29:58] now that seems that seems contrary to
[30:00] the way that we think sometimes we think
[30:02] maybe maybe the devil's got you
[30:03] convinced that you got to be a real
[30:05] smart real good intellect somebody that
[30:07] knows all that's got a PhD and the and
[30:11] the things of this world to be able to
[30:12] understand this message but all God
[30:14] needs is just a humble heart somebody
[30:17] that'll just open themselves up to this
[30:19] word somebody that will turn off the TV
[30:21] and turn off Facebook and turn off the
[30:23] social media and just get and lay in the
[30:25] word and let God have his way with you
[30:27] that's all God needs God is just looking
[30:29] for somebody that he can get a hold of
[30:31] that somebody just humble themselves to
[30:33] the word and you know what real humility
[30:35] is I think we get tripped up with what
[30:37] real humility is sometimes humility is
[30:40] just knowing knowing your strengths and
[30:42] knowing your weaknesses and not being
[30:45] overly lifted up and not being not oh
[30:48] see so many times we get lifted up with
[30:50] let this false humility well I I don't
[30:52] know if I'm a really good singer or not
[30:55] oh come on now I don't know I don't know
[30:57] see God don't want none of that false
[30:59] humility I don't know if I'm really
[31:01] called to preach oh if you're called to
[31:03] preach he wants you to be confident in
[31:05] it lack of confidence is not humility
[31:08] God wants you to know if if you're
[31:09] called to if you're called to sing if
[31:12] God has put you with a gift where you
[31:13] can bring the presence of the Lord
[31:15] because you can sing and you got a real
[31:17] gift then you might as well own it and
[31:19] say that's what I'm put here on Earth
[31:21] for if you're called to preach you might
[31:22] as well be confident in it and know that
[31:25] God God put you on this Earth to be a
[31:26] bless blingg to other people and God
[31:28] give you a gift to be able to speak his
[31:30] word you might as well be confident in
[31:32] God don't want somebody that'll draw
[31:34] back and some that sissified he wants
[31:36] somebody to be bold and preach it if
[31:38] it's got to be preached and sing it so
[31:40] somebody can receive a blessing that's
[31:42] false humility when you say well I I
[31:44] don't know I don't know I don't God
[31:47] wants somebody to sure if they're born
[31:49] again or not not just go around and say
[31:51] well I don't know if I don't know I
[31:53] might be he wants you to know to know
[31:56] whether you're a adopted or not to know
[31:59] whether you're born again to know
[32:01] whether you got it cuz you're going to
[32:03] have to know whether you got it if
[32:04] you're going to take a body change God
[32:06] ain't going to have a bride that don't
[32:07] know whether she's this or whether she's
[32:09] that that's going to step over into
[32:11] eternity he's not going to have somebody
[32:13] with some false humility but he's going
[32:14] to have somebody confident in what they
[32:17] are and who they are and what kind of a
[32:20] word they've heard and what it's done in
[32:21] their
[32:22] life Matthew Chapter 5 he said Jesus
[32:25] said blessed are the PO poor in spirit
[32:28] the poor in spirit that's real humility
[32:30] to be able to receive something like a
[32:33] real little sheep to be able to sit down
[32:36] and listen to what somebody else has got
[32:38] to say blessed are they that mourn for
[32:41] they shall be comforted blessed are the
[32:43] meek this this are the things these are
[32:45] the attributes of the kind of person
[32:48] that God can do something with blessed
[32:50] are the meek for they shall inherit the
[32:52] earth blessed are they which do hunger
[32:54] and thirst after righteousness for for
[32:57] they shall be filled and I got news for
[32:59] you my brothers and sisters tonight I'm
[33:01] still hungering and thirsting for
[33:02] righteousness after all these years I
[33:05] want to keep getting filled that's my
[33:07] that's my prayer and my desire as we
[33:09] step over into the other year I still
[33:11] want more of God I want more I want all
[33:14] I can get I want more and more the more
[33:17] I can get I believe the more that God
[33:19] will fill us up with it blessed are they
[33:22] which are persecuted for righteousness
[33:23] sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[33:26] and blessed are ye and Men shall revile
[33:28] you and persecute you and shall say all
[33:30] manner of evil against you falsely for
[33:32] my sake now this this is the cream of
[33:35] the crop somebody that's poor and meek
[33:37] and ain't got nothing but all they they
[33:39] need they they know that they if they
[33:41] can just get a hold of God that's all
[33:43] they want that's the kind of person that
[33:46] God can do something with so this
[33:48] afternoon I I just want to encourage you
[33:50] that if you're poor and you're unlearned
[33:52] and the devil's got you all beat down
[33:54] and your body's all beaten up by life
[33:56] and you're weary and you're mourning
[33:58] have I got good news for you that this
[34:00] is the type you're the type that this
[34:02] gospel was sent for that's the kind of
[34:04] person that God can do something with
[34:06] there somebody that's poor and meek and
[34:09] lonely that like a little sheep God give
[34:11] tell me where the green grass is and
[34:13] I'll eat it up Lead Me lead me to the
[34:16] water and I'll drink it up tell me where
[34:18] I can get it and I'll go get it aren't
[34:20] you glad that the true gospel me it
[34:22] wasn't wasn't meant to just make you
[34:24] feel stupid or to put you down or make
[34:26] you feel feel bad for just taking God at
[34:28] his word but it was said to an humble
[34:31] open heart that is what God is looking
[34:34] for somebody that just receive him like
[34:37] sheep like a
[34:39] sheep just a little
[34:41] sheep you can like like Monica tell us
[34:44] when they were growing up they' they'd
[34:47] kill little lambs to eat you know and
[34:49] the little sheep they wouldn't cry out
[34:51] cuz it's it's not their nature to cry
[34:53] out it's not their nature to complain
[34:56] it's just their nature to just eat and
[34:57] keep pushing out that wool it's not
[35:00] their nature to be anything else but
[35:02] gentle just a
[35:04] gentle sociable sociable creature and
[35:08] that's why sheep get they got to you got
[35:11] to come together bringing your little
[35:13] elix of fire together sheep got to be
[35:15] you got to be with other sheep oh I so
[35:19] terrible to see what the devil will do
[35:20] will just isolate people and get that
[35:22] little sheep off to the self and here
[35:24] comes a wolf to go put something weird
[35:27] in their mind put some s thought in
[35:29] their mind as soon as that little sheep
[35:30] goes off to itself it it it starts
[35:33] thinking well everybody hates me and I
[35:35] can't trust in those Shepherds and
[35:37] nobody nobody really lives the right way
[35:40] and nobody really does this and that oh
[35:43] you got to get together sheep are meant
[35:45] to be together you start getting
[35:48] together and things begin to change
[35:49] you're meant to be together you're
[35:51] dependent you're depend sheep are
[35:53] dependent they got to have that Shepherd
[35:55] that's why when you see that Shepherd
[35:57] that sheep begin to go away from the
[35:59] flock a real true Shepherd will go
[36:01] running after that sheep and say come on
[36:03] back come on back to church don't don't
[36:06] you miss fellowshipping with the other
[36:07] believers don't you miss being around
[36:09] with other saints of God don't you miss
[36:12] CU a sheep a sheep's got to follow
[36:14] leadership a sheep's got to be led and
[36:17] and what's the point of this message
[36:18] that brother Brandon was laying out
[36:20] there and why it had to be Shepherds as
[36:22] we're being led by the Holy Ghost amen
[36:25] we're being led by the Holy Ghost ghost
[36:27] now what a strange isn't that
[36:30] strange that God will put men to lead a
[36:33] a group of people but it's actually not
[36:36] men if they really will yield themselves
[36:39] and and yield themselves so that God can
[36:41] speak a word to them of encouragement
[36:43] and something that'll help it won't it
[36:45] won't put complexes on people if it's
[36:47] really God it won't put you into a place
[36:49] into B where it's binding you up but
[36:51] it'll actually liberate you if it's
[36:53] really the Holy Ghost speaking through
[36:55] through the men but it what a strange
[36:57] thing that it's he puts men but it's not
[37:00] men men preaching a word but it's not
[37:04] men sheep what else are sheep going to
[37:06] be vulnerable they won't be competitive
[37:09] they won't be competing with everybody
[37:12] why cuz they're just trusting in the
[37:13] shepherd trusting in the shepherd to
[37:15] lead him where that grass is they're not
[37:17] going to be pushing one another out of
[37:19] the way this spot of grass is mine
[37:21] there's plenty there's plenty for all
[37:23] they don't have to I don't have to
[37:24] compete compete with the next person
[37:26] over who got the nicest car or who's got
[37:28] the nicest this but we're just trusting
[37:30] in Our Shepherd now I think that's real
[37:32] what real faith is real faith is when
[37:35] you trust in your Shepherd not the man
[37:38] that's standing behind the pulpit but
[37:39] we're trusting in God trusting in God to
[37:43] lead us from pasture to pasture lead us
[37:46] from grassy spot to grassy spot lead us
[37:49] cuz we've got a promise that the spirit
[37:51] of truth will lead and guide us into all
[37:53] truth so we're not following a man we're
[37:56] following the Holy Ghost that's moving
[37:59] through men that's that's preaching to
[38:01] us a word that came not from man but
[38:03] Straight from Heaven straight from an
[38:06] angel's message an angel that come to us
[38:08] to deliver us a message straight from
[38:10] the Throne of God that will change our
[38:13] hearts and change our lives and change
[38:15] our thinking to be just like
[38:19] him why did the Angels go to Shepherds
[38:22] to bring the message brother B said if
[38:25] the Messiah was born in the shadow of
[38:26] the
[38:27] cathedral why do they have to go Plum
[38:30] back up into the mountains to a bunch of
[38:31] unlearned untrained Shepherds to bring
[38:33] the great message the first message and
[38:36] commission Shepherds not the wise and
[38:38] trained but Shepherds it's a strange
[38:41] thing isn't it look like the most unfit
[38:44] people for such a task to reveal the
[38:47] message and send them out to bring the
[38:49] message he would be more able to get his
[38:52] message to a unlearned group so that
[38:54] that than he would be to a mixed up
[38:56] group that was so set in their ways that
[39:01] nothing could turn them not even the
[39:03] word of
[39:04] God now that's why it's got to be
[39:06] Shepherds shepherds are like sheep
[39:10] Shepherds brother Brown will say
[39:12] Shepherds smell you got to smell a real
[39:13] true Shepherd is going to smell like
[39:15] sheep CU he gets in amongst the sheep
[39:17] and really really if you this is kind of
[39:19] a hard thing to imagine in your head but
[39:21] a Shepherd is really a sheep too a sheep
[39:24] they're all sheep and a sheep God God as
[39:26] Ates certain men to to kind of to be
[39:29] leaders of the others and the reason
[39:31] that he can get a hold of these men and
[39:33] anybody that fits under that that uh the
[39:37] umbrella of being a sheep is because
[39:39] they're willing to
[39:41] learn willing to learn he would be more
[39:45] able to get his message to unlearned
[39:47] group than he would be to a mixed up
[39:50] group that was so set in their ways oh
[39:53] Lord I don't ever want to be set so set
[39:55] in my ways that I can't I can't be moved
[39:57] by the Holy Spirit moving in the
[39:59] congregation the Holy Spirit
[40:01] moving people get so hard-hearted and so
[40:04] set well I I know this is right and
[40:07] nobody's going to tell me different I
[40:09] know the way that I see it is right and
[40:11] you're not going to tell me nothing else
[40:14] that's the kind of person that God can't
[40:16] do nothing with always be will that's
[40:19] true humility always be willing to just
[40:21] sit and listen to what the other person
[40:24] says cuz even when somebody's wrong
[40:28] sometimes you can get just a little
[40:29] glimmer of some truth or maybe they can
[40:32] reflect back to you an aspect of
[40:34] yourself that you haven't seen before
[40:36] always be willing to be humble and
[40:38] listen to what somebody else says the
[40:41] Messiah was here and there must be
[40:43] somebody to recognize it and brother
[40:46] rown will say the shepherd was the most
[40:47] illiterate of anybody he didn't need to
[40:49] know nothing but just about his sheep he
[40:53] didn't need to know mathematics he
[40:54] didn't need to know how to split an Adam
[40:56] he didn't need no scholarship he just
[40:59] had to know his sheep that's all he
[41:01] needed to
[41:02] know oh
[41:05] no get tangled up here again all
[41:11] right he just had to know his sheep
[41:15] Shepherd that's all he had to know is
[41:16] just his sheep he didn't know need to
[41:18] know how smart anybody was or all the
[41:20] things of science all he needed to know
[41:23] was about his sheep now what would a
[41:26] Shepherd need to know about sheep well
[41:28] first of all he need to know how to call
[41:31] sheep cuz the Sheep now a real true
[41:34] gospel sheep isn't this interesting now
[41:37] a real true gospel sheep is going to be
[41:38] able to recognize the voice of a
[41:40] Shepherd a sheep my sheep know my voice
[41:43] is what Jesus said so they're going to
[41:44] be able to know the rec recognize when
[41:47] God is calling them now that's how you
[41:50] call sheep as you preach the real true
[41:52] unadulterated word of God and the Sheep
[41:54] are going to respond a Shepherd's going
[41:56] to know what's going to help the Sheep
[41:58] they're going to be able to know well if
[41:59] I if I take them to this green grass
[42:01] over there then that's going to be a
[42:02] help to them but if I just lead them
[42:04] leave them alone then they're going to
[42:05] get here comes a wolf a sheep Shepherd
[42:08] is going to know what's best and what
[42:09] sheep eat and where the Sheep need to be
[42:11] led and what's the enemy of the sheep
[42:13] and the best way to protect them and how
[42:15] are sheep born CU a sheep Shepherd is
[42:18] going to know that sheep are born by the
[42:20] word of God and brother Brown would
[42:22] saying God the great wisdom and the
[42:24] fountain and resource of all wisdom
[42:25] would choose such a person as that he
[42:28] say persons persons rather as that and
[42:31] bypassed all the well- trained Scholars
[42:33] that's trained to know that the highest
[42:36] Heavens hastened to honor Earth's most
[42:38] humble and unlearned the highest of
[42:40] Heaven came down to make himself known
[42:44] to the lowest of the earth bypassing all
[42:47] between to make himself known to Common
[42:49] herdsmen coming to give these common
[42:52] herdmen the greatest message of all all
[42:56] times now what's the greatest message of
[42:59] all times I I believe tonight that we've
[43:01] heard a message Straight from Heaven
[43:03] straight from an Ang the angel of our
[43:04] age has come to give us a message and
[43:07] what's the message to know where Christ
[43:10] is to reveal Christ to you and what an
[43:14] honor I I believe this afternoon it is
[43:16] to know where Christ is what an honor to
[43:18] be able to carry this message carry
[43:20] whether whether you're sitting in the
[43:21] Pew or standing up behind the pulpit
[43:23] you're carrying the message you're
[43:24] carrying it in your heart to be able to
[43:26] know beyond the shadow of a doubt where
[43:29] Christ is today that God made himself as
[43:33] lonely as those he would receive he come
[43:35] down in that in that little manger as to
[43:37] associate with himself with those little
[43:39] Shepherds the lowliest of the earth just
[43:43] just covered in the in the in the things
[43:44] of the of the outdoors and all of those
[43:47] things and so many were bypassed because
[43:49] they couldn't receive it but God came to
[43:52] your
[43:53] doorstep oh we got so many things to be
[43:56] thankful for as we as we close out this
[43:58] year that God that God would come to
[44:00] your doorstep and bring the greatest
[44:02] message to ever be brought to know in
[44:05] this day when after after seven Church
[44:07] ages when people probed and wondered at
[44:09] this and wondered at that but in this
[44:11] day you can know where God is where God
[44:16] is in Matthew chapter 24 he says behold
[44:19] I told you before wherefore they shall
[44:21] say behold he is in the desert oh he's
[44:23] over there in the desert go not forth'
[44:26] behold he is in the secret Chambers
[44:29] believe it not for as the lightning
[44:31] cometh out of the East and shineth even
[44:33] under the West so shall also the coming
[44:35] of the son of man be for wheresoever the
[44:38] carcass is there will the Eagles be
[44:40] gathered together so where is God where
[44:43] is he at he's where the word is and
[44:46] you've heard the word and you've eaten
[44:47] the word and as you hear the word you
[44:50] become the word thank God that we can
[44:52] know by oh Jesus is telling us when they
[44:54] tell you he's a well he's over here come
[44:56] on now listen he's over he's over in
[44:59] Jeffersonville he's up he's up well I
[45:02] know he's in a specific geographic
[45:04] location he's at this specific spot
[45:08] don't believe it because you know where
[45:11] Jesus is you know where Christ is and
[45:14] what a blessing to know where he is I'm
[45:17] talking about by Revelation now you know
[45:19] real Revelation real a real revelation
[45:21] will give you overcoming power and I'm
[45:24] not talking tonight about just kind of
[45:26] an intellectual understanding where we
[45:27] have enough that we can we can kind of
[45:29] go to battle with somebody on a YouTube
[45:31] channel or something or we can go to
[45:32] battle with people on Facebook and we
[45:34] can tell everybody else how much we know
[45:36] and how much how much we've understand
[45:38] but real revelation will give you power
[45:40] over the de I'm talking about power to
[45:42] live a life power to know to know we
[45:47] overcoming power is to be able to
[45:48] recognize the devil in his tricks when
[45:50] he comes to you and tells you something
[45:52] that's contrary to what you know what
[45:55] you know and that's that's why you must
[45:56] know you must have confidence because
[45:59] when the Devil comes to tell you some
[46:00] lie that's contrary to what you know
[46:03] then you can recognize that that's a
[46:04] trap of the devil and say get get the
[46:07] behind me Satan like Jesus told Peter
[46:09] when because he told Jesus something
[46:12] contrary to what he knew that he had to
[46:15] go to the cross and die and Peter said
[46:18] something contrary to that anything
[46:20] contrary to the word of God is the
[46:23] Antichrist anything contr to the word of
[46:26] God and that's why you must know you
[46:28] must have a personal revelation not just
[46:30] head knowledge not just head knowledge
[46:32] that's been packed up but a real packed
[46:34] into your head and packed into your
[46:36] understanding but a real revelation of
[46:38] who Jesus Christ is and that's when you
[46:40] know you know where that that where the
[46:44] where the where God is revealed in flesh
[46:47] brother R will say here he comes with
[46:49] the greatest of all the messages and
[46:51] what was the message what was the
[46:54] message brother R will say
[46:56] Messiah is here now oh you think about a
[47:00] message that everybody out in the world
[47:02] they don't realize that they're put it
[47:04] off they put it off way in the future
[47:07] one day Jesus is going to come back one
[47:10] day he's coming back but to think that
[47:12] he's here now right here on the
[47:15] Wednesday night service right here as as
[47:18] you know the eyes begin to droop and
[47:20] people were wondering if how long is
[47:22] brother Bob going to go and thinking
[47:24] about maybe the thing that you're going
[47:26] to eat when you get home and maybe maybe
[47:28] you might be in that stage of your
[47:29] spiritual journey where you really
[47:31] wishing wishing that you could be
[47:32] watching some some movie or something
[47:34] instead of being at church but even
[47:37] despite all that God is here now and you
[47:41] can know where he is see to brother BR
[47:45] said to make that known to make that
[47:47] known where Messiah is where God is he
[47:51] bypassed all the train to make it known
[47:55] to humble
[47:56] Shepherds
[47:58] somebody that could receive a message
[48:02] what a strange message go to Bethlehem
[48:03] and you'll find a baby in a Manger what
[48:08] you'd think that that would be in this
[48:10] big Cathedral over here you'd think that
[48:12] I'd have to go to the to the high priest
[48:14] down in Jerusalem you'd think I'd have
[48:16] to go anybody but a little manger in
[48:20] Bethlehem but it bypassed all the Nobles
[48:23] and was revealed to the
[48:26] nobodies aren't you glad tonight aren't
[48:29] you glad to be a
[48:34] nobody notice brother rown said where
[48:37] the message was and the most unlikely
[48:39] place that anyone would expect it to
[48:41] come and I wonder tonight if we were
[48:44] looking for the true message of the Lord
[48:46] Jesus I wonder if it would be an
[48:49] unlikely group I wonder if that wouldn't
[48:51] be where we'd find him the most unlikely
[48:55] place
[48:56] and to the most unlikely speakers the
[48:59] most unlikely place a little off the
[49:02] road little place in the middle of a
[49:04] small town in Lula where we don't have
[49:06] smoke machines and glass pulpits and
[49:09] coffee shops down in in the bottom of
[49:11] the building where people can come and
[49:13] and and talk and and and network with
[49:15] all of their friends and people and get
[49:17] a good get past business cards out and
[49:19] network with other people and and it's
[49:21] not not in some Lodge not in some big
[49:24] building and to the most qualified
[49:26] speakers that people that weren't
[49:27] trained up in seminaries people that
[49:30] don't know that don't know how to speak
[49:31] that they just they were working their
[49:33] own job and doing their their normal
[49:36] thing trying to have a family and then
[49:37] God C grabbed a hold of their life and
[49:39] said I want you to speak for me I want
[49:43] you to share the gospel to other people
[49:45] and that's the kind of people that God
[49:47] can use that God can grab a hold of
[49:49] somebody's life your life and my life
[49:52] and and begin to change them by the word
[49:54] and use them for his purpose so the
[49:57] things maybe that they thought that they
[49:58] were going to do when they were young
[50:00] and the things that they thought that
[50:01] would make them happy God molded them by
[50:04] the word and changed them so all that
[50:06] they left behind and and all that they
[50:09] laid down and they didn't want it no
[50:11] more and they just gave everything to
[50:13] God that's the kind of people that God
[50:15] can use somebody that he can somebody
[50:17] that will lble themselves to the word
[50:19] and just let God make him a prisoner of
[50:22] his and say no matter what I do with you
[50:25] like Paul if you got to go to Rome and
[50:27] have your head chopped off or like
[50:28] Bartholomew and be skinned alive or like
[50:31] Andrew that was crucified in an ex I'm
[50:33] going to do with you what I want to do
[50:35] with you and they would say God thy will
[50:38] be done Shepherds that know nothing
[50:40] about speaking only calling sheep oh you
[50:44] think about those early disciples that
[50:46] they didn't know nothing about nothing
[50:47] Peter couldn't even write his own name
[50:49] but they knew how to call sheep Peter
[50:52] sitting there in that fishing boat and
[50:53] Jesus said follow me and I'll make you a
[50:56] fisherman and that man that didn't know
[50:58] anything more than just had a pull on
[51:00] that rope he got out of that boat and he
[51:02] followed Jesus and God began to mold his
[51:05] life so that he could do something with
[51:07] him the great Shepherd was calling we're
[51:09] not following men but we're following
[51:11] the great Shepherd the one that's
[51:13] drawing us the one that's pulling all of
[51:15] us God is the one that's calling John
[51:18] chapter 10 he said Jesus he said Jesus
[51:22] speaking he said Jesus answered them I
[51:23] told you and you believe not
[51:26] The Works that I do in my father's name
[51:28] they bear witness of me but ye believe
[51:30] not because you are not of my sheep as I
[51:33] said unto you my sheep hear my voice and
[51:36] I know them and they follow me oh thank
[51:40] God that sheep can recognize when it's
[51:42] God calling them sheep can recognize
[51:45] sheep can recognize good grass sheep can
[51:48] recognize when it's the Deep calling
[51:51] they know their Shepherd they know they
[51:54] know when it's
[51:55] that thing that they've been looking for
[51:57] their whole life and they hear it
[52:00] calling out to them and they respond cuz
[52:02] sheep know their Shepherd the shepherd's
[52:05] call what is the shepherd's call he's
[52:08] here oh think about all those people in
[52:10] brother Ram's campaign they come there
[52:12] and they they see the prayer line start
[52:14] and they begin to
[52:15] recognize that God is here that this is
[52:19] different than just a normal little
[52:21] church service and when you hear the
[52:23] real preaching of the Gospel preached
[52:24] across the pool and something begins to
[52:26] Echo in your heart and something begins
[52:28] to draw you and pull you you recognize
[52:30] that it ain't just some man talking to
[52:32] you that it's God drawing you and you
[52:35] begin to respond it's a deep calling to
[52:37] the Deep it's a deep pulling you it's
[52:39] something more it's something more than
[52:42] just something natural it's something
[52:43] Supernatural happening Brother would say
[52:46] the infinite wisdom of almighty God did
[52:48] it to make known to them the greatest
[52:51] message ever was that the Messiah is now
[52:54] on Earth
[52:55] Earth he is here he is here is the
[52:59] confession of every believer that's what
[53:01] John said in 1 John chapter 4 hereby
[53:04] know ye the spirit of God every spirit
[53:07] that confesseth that Jesus Christ has
[53:09] come in the flesh is of God and every
[53:13] spirit that confesseth not that Jesus
[53:15] Christ is come in the flesh is not of
[53:17] God now think about that that's the
[53:20] confession of every believer that Jesus
[53:23] Christ is come In the Flesh that's the
[53:27] confession a present tense confession
[53:30] that Jesus Christ has come and to know
[53:32] where he is to know that he's in your
[53:37] flesh to know that he's been born in the
[53:40] manger of your heart oh what a blessing
[53:43] that is at this time of year to know now
[53:47] I'm preaching as though you know but if
[53:49] you don't know let's don't go into
[53:52] another year not knowing if you don't
[53:55] don't know that Christ is born in your
[53:58] heart if you don't know that it's time
[54:02] it's time to get serious oh this weekend
[54:05] we're going to be we're going to going
[54:06] to be gathering here for the watch Night
[54:08] Service to all to gather together to
[54:10] step over into another year but let's
[54:12] don't step over into another year
[54:14] without getting real serious before God
[54:17] no matter where you are at your stage of
[54:19] your journey let's just just set it in
[54:21] your mind yes that I want God I want
[54:25] more of God and I'm not going to rest
[54:27] until I get him and I'm not going to
[54:29] rest until I see the promises the
[54:31] promises that are laying here in the
[54:32] Bible that are manifest in my life
[54:36] because if you look if you look for him
[54:37] if you come looking for him and
[54:39] expecting him to come on the scene then
[54:41] you watch and see if God doesn't
[54:43] manifest himself to
[54:47] you man is always praising God brother R
[54:51] said religious man for what he done and
[54:52] always pointing people to what he he's
[54:55] doing and then ignoring to what he's
[54:57] going to do and then ignoring what he's
[54:59] doing but can you see what God is doing
[55:02] now I I wonder if we could ask that
[55:05] question can you see what God is doing
[55:07] now like when we come to a church on
[55:10] Wednesday night I I I don't ever want to
[55:12] get to where it just becomes boring to
[55:14] me if we get bored by the by the word if
[55:17] you're if you get bored by the word
[55:18] let's set it in our mind that next year
[55:20] I want like pray like David did restore
[55:23] unto me the joy of by salvation if if
[55:27] you maybe you didn't lose your salvation
[55:29] if you really are got your salvation you
[55:31] ain't going to lose it but maybe you
[55:33] lost the joy of it and you just kind of
[55:35] begin to you you spent too much time on
[55:38] social media and you've spent too much
[55:39] time watching movies and things that you
[55:41] you know you shouldn't be giving all
[55:43] your time to that and you just you maybe
[55:45] you hadn't felt the presence of the Lord
[55:47] for a while because you just forsaken
[55:49] you've forsaken your prayer life and you
[55:51] just got away you it's been a long time
[55:53] since you read the Bible as as we step
[55:55] over into the new year let's let's lay
[55:57] all that stuff to the side let's lay all
[56:00] that to the side and just get real
[56:01] serious about being a real Christian
[56:05] I I I was reading a sermon the other day
[56:08] about just how brother R was saying that
[56:10] you like a woman is only got 20 years to
[56:12] have children and he was saying that how
[56:14] he was making the point that we we've
[56:16] only got so many so many years in our
[56:18] life that we can really make an impact
[56:21] to the family that we have to other
[56:22] people only so many years of life before
[56:25] you know your mind begins to deteriorate
[56:27] your body begins to give out and then
[56:29] you go down if if things go on you'll go
[56:32] down into the grave so let's maximize
[56:34] the time redeem the time give everything
[56:37] that we can to God I I was reading where
[56:40] brother Brown said he said I I've I've
[56:42] won a million souls to God but why not
[56:46] two million is what he said why not two
[56:49] million there he was laying there when
[56:51] he when he went beyond the curtain of
[56:52] time laying there and he was thinking
[56:54] before he passed up before he had that
[56:56] that uh experience thinking about how
[56:59] much he more he could have done for God
[57:01] and you think about a man like that that
[57:03] would have that kind of a confession
[57:05] think about I wish i' had done so much
[57:06] more for God when he had given
[57:08] everything in his life and just where
[57:10] where people were wondering brother
[57:11] randam how can you stand he he'd stand
[57:13] up behind the poop and say I faint I
[57:15] almost fainted 10 times while I was
[57:17] answering these questions and he all he
[57:20] gave everything and yet we can barely
[57:22] give anything we can barely give any
[57:24] time to read or pray or study we hardly
[57:27] know what the message is about because
[57:29] we can't get into the message and find
[57:30] out for ourselves but oh let's don't go
[57:33] into another year like that but let's
[57:35] really give everything that we've
[57:38] got cuz God wants a nobody a nothing
[57:41] that he can do something with somebody
[57:43] that he can get a hold of he wants
[57:45] somebody like Gideon that thought they
[57:47] couldn't do it somebody like Ruth that
[57:49] had a b bad background somebody like
[57:51] Elijah that just come out of
[57:53] nowhere somebody like like John that
[57:55] come out of the wild wilderness cuz God
[57:57] takes the nothings he takes the nothings
[58:00] to do the something with and as long as
[58:02] we think we're something then we can't
[58:05] be used in the hand of God we must
[58:07] forsake all we ever knew or learned to
[58:11] go after Jesus look to the word if all
[58:15] else is
[58:17] contrary that's what the Magi were doing
[58:20] they were looking they knew some one of
[58:22] these days A promise is coming but we're
[58:25] not looking for one of these days
[58:26] anymore are we oh that's what the
[58:29] message is that Christ is here brother
[58:32] Brown would say When God says he'll do a
[58:34] thing he did it regardless of what
[58:36] anybody else thinks about it what
[58:37] anybody says when he said behold a
[58:40] virgin shall conceive that might have
[58:42] been hard to imagine that a little
[58:43] virgin was going to conceive and bear a
[58:46] child but it came to pass when he said
[58:48] For unto us a child is born unto us a
[58:50] son is given that seemed hard to imagine
[58:53] that one day that would be fulfilled but
[58:55] then God brought it to pass and when God
[58:58] told Daniel when in Daniel chapter N9
[59:00] know therefore and understand that from
[59:02] the going forth of the Commandment to
[59:04] restore and build Jerusalem shall be
[59:06] seven weeks and three score and two
[59:08] weeks it would be hard to imagine that
[59:11] one of these days one day that would be
[59:14] fulfilled and the Messiah would be
[59:16] standing there think about all those
[59:18] things that were laying there for the
[59:20] Pharisees and the Jews to read that God
[59:22] actually gave them the timeline when the
[59:25] Messiah would be standing there still
[59:26] they couldn't see him and he's given so
[59:28] many people in the world a timeline of
[59:31] what exactly what to look for and yet
[59:33] they couldn't see it but yet the Messiah
[59:36] the the Magi the Magi were looking never
[59:39] stop expecting for God to fulfill his
[59:42] word don't ever stop expecting to see
[59:45] God fulfill his word oh we come to
[59:47] church day after or week after week
[59:50] Sunday Wednesday after year and and it
[59:53] and it might oh it might kind of get
[59:55] boring to you it might kind of get
[59:56] wearisome to you but don't ever now I'm
[59:59] I'm don't draw back on me now please
[1:00:02] don't draw back I'm telling you
[1:00:03] something real tonight don't ever stop
[1:00:06] expecting for God to fulfill his word or
[1:00:08] if you need some I was reading one one
[1:00:10] place where brother R said when we have
[1:00:12] a need in our life it seems like the
[1:00:14] first place we go is to the doctor the
[1:00:16] first place we go is to somebody else
[1:00:18] but if you when you got a real need when
[1:00:21] something happens maybe you break your
[1:00:22] arm or something go goes wrong in your
[1:00:24] body run to Jesus because why cuz never
[1:00:28] stop expecting to see a miracle never
[1:00:31] stop expecting to see God do something
[1:00:34] and that's what the mag I were doing
[1:00:36] night after night they look up in the
[1:00:37] sky look up this up in the sky
[1:00:40] continuously basing their faith on what
[1:00:42] they had heard Daniel say when Daniel
[1:00:45] was down in the Middle East years and
[1:00:47] years and years before that but yet they
[1:00:48] kept looking cuz they knew that the
[1:00:51] Messiah was coming why cuz it said in
[1:00:54] Daniel 9:24 it actually laid it out the
[1:00:56] timeline said the Messiah the prince
[1:00:58] shall be seven weeks and three score and
[1:01:01] two weeks and after that time period
[1:01:04] after that he's coming so the Magi were
[1:01:07] looking these wise men know that there
[1:01:09] would be a star of Jacob rise and they
[1:01:12] were looking for it and the star LED
[1:01:14] them straight up to Jerusalem where
[1:01:16] you'd think everybody would know what
[1:01:18] they were looking for up and down the
[1:01:20] streets where is he this born King of
[1:01:22] the Jews we saw saw his star in the east
[1:01:25] and after two years two years of those
[1:01:28] Shepherds preaching a message we know
[1:01:30] where he is we know where you can find
[1:01:32] him that great religious Capital still
[1:01:34] didn't have the answer or know nothing
[1:01:37] about
[1:01:39] it I think about
[1:01:41] that after all these years of the
[1:01:44] greatest message to be ever preached has
[1:01:46] been preached around the world and all
[1:01:48] these denominational systems don't know
[1:01:50] nothing about where you can find Christ
[1:01:52] where are you going to find the son of
[1:01:53] man
[1:01:55] but Shepherds had the answer Shepherds
[1:01:58] that a lot of people and I'll be closing
[1:02:00] in just a minute I'm not going to go
[1:02:02] long tonight Shepherds that most of the
[1:02:06] world just look down on Shepherds that
[1:02:09] maybe maybe people in the church think
[1:02:10] well they just don't even like me every
[1:02:12] time they preach all they got to do is
[1:02:14] they got to meddle in people's business
[1:02:16] and and preach on stuff that I wish they
[1:02:17] wouldn't preach on but Shepherds had the
[1:02:19] answer it was Shepherd what a strange
[1:02:21] things that God was set it up his
[1:02:23] patterns so you'd come to church all the
[1:02:25] sheep that want to be sociable would
[1:02:27] come to church and hear a Shepherd a
[1:02:29] little lonely person that that has no
[1:02:32] background no credentials why cuz
[1:02:35] Shepherds Shepherds were happy they were
[1:02:38] at ease with where Christ was born in
[1:02:41] that manger bride amongst all of the
[1:02:44] bleeding of the Lambs and all the the
[1:02:46] cows and the mooing and all the uh the
[1:02:49] the dirty thing they were fine they were
[1:02:52] comfortable shepherds are comfortable
[1:02:54] God knows where to send his
[1:02:56] messag God knows who's going to be
[1:02:58] comfortable with it what an honor how
[1:03:00] fitting it is to a Shepherd to receive a
[1:03:02] message of a newborn sheep it could come
[1:03:05] to nothing else but a
[1:03:07] Shepherd the Shepherds heard that the
[1:03:10] Messi that the Messiah was on Earth and
[1:03:12] came into his presence right in their
[1:03:13] own environment and found the message to
[1:03:16] be true was Vindicated there how that
[1:03:20] must have made those men feel to find
[1:03:23] that God had done this great thing for
[1:03:26] them now that's the confession of any
[1:03:29] real sheep to how great it is to
[1:03:32] recognize what God has done for you that
[1:03:35] he bypassed all the religious world he
[1:03:37] bypassed all these great religious
[1:03:39] writers you could think about this that
[1:03:41] you could go in the bookstore and pull
[1:03:43] off the book off the shelves all these
[1:03:45] all these great books that great
[1:03:47] theologians have written but God
[1:03:49] bypassed them to give it to you cuz you
[1:03:52] would receive it he' give it to you
[1:03:54] some of them her hers might not might
[1:03:56] not have even been able to sign their
[1:03:58] own name but he called them and give it
[1:04:00] to them poor humble
[1:04:03] Shepherds that had no
[1:04:05] education with a message what was their
[1:04:09] message I can prove it to you that this
[1:04:12] is the baby this is the messenger now
[1:04:15] that's crowd of statement in it and that
[1:04:18] is why this is not just kind of an
[1:04:20] intellectual Affair a real Revelation
[1:04:23] comes with power
[1:04:24] I'm talking about power to demonstrate
[1:04:26] the gospel power to make this word live
[1:04:30] and that is what the shepherd's message
[1:04:32] was power to talk about a living a
[1:04:35] living God they didn't go to that down
[1:04:37] to Bethlehem to see just a little a
[1:04:39] little dead baby laying in the manger or
[1:04:42] or just like a book laying in the manger
[1:04:44] but they went to see a living Christ a
[1:04:47] living baby that would open his mouth
[1:04:49] and cry a living baby that did baby
[1:04:53] things a living baby that's what this
[1:04:57] message is a Living Word it's got to be
[1:05:02] alive it's got to be alive in you and I
[1:05:06] I I was reading I was going back and
[1:05:08] reading all these quotes for brother R
[1:05:09] said the evidence of the new birth is
[1:05:13] not just knowing things it's that's part
[1:05:16] of it but it's got to be alive in you
[1:05:19] you have got to see something change in
[1:05:22] your life you've got to see something
[1:05:24] something happen in you and when it
[1:05:27] happens in you then you then you've got
[1:05:29] something that you can share with the
[1:05:31] world that's what those Shepherds were
[1:05:33] testifying of that Jesus Christ is not
[1:05:37] dead he's alive he's here today
[1:05:41] Shepherds praising God going around
[1:05:43] telling everybody that God is alive that
[1:05:46] he's still he's still a present tense
[1:05:49] god brother R said it's so simple that's
[1:05:52] how the wise overlooks it it's so simple
[1:05:54] it confounds them they look for a god
[1:05:57] way out there when he's right here when
[1:06:00] he's right here right here in this
[1:06:03] building tonight right
[1:06:06] here where we Overlook they're looking
[1:06:09] for something way Yonder when it's right

[1:06:14] dead the same yesterday today and
[1:06:17] forever thank God that we know what to
[1:06:19] do with the word brother said they were
[1:06:22] the only kind that would accept him they

[1:06:26] it today when we get the Lamb's message
[1:06:30] and we'll close we'll close on this

[1:06:56] singing When God well I'm talking about
[1:06:58] praise when God does something for you
