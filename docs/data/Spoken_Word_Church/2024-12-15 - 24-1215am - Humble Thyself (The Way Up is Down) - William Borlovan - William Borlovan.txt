dad had you know he had his business and all of his tools and man he just had so much so many things and my job maybe that's why I became an accountant I tried to organize many of the things he had and keep it organized and clean up and and um you know over the years as he's gotten older you know those things have they're gone you know he does have any of those tools anymore any of those things that he once had that took care of a family provided for us and now he has no need for any of them you know the time has comeing that season of his life and you know as long as we all here we're going to come to those Seasons you know and um we got to keep that balance while we're in the seasons of young Youth and things mean so much to us and keep our eyes on that side of it that's our permanent longlasting home you know you keep us in prayer you know our family's been through just so much you know my dear wife you know losing her brother and Mom and you know us coming to a new place you know teenage kids and and young adults and um it's been hard it's been hard you know but God is good through through it all God is good you know all we're doing right now is seeking the perfect will of the Lord that's our desire the perfect will of the Lord and to keep that Joy until until until we reach that permanent permanent home so I appreciate you all God bless you thank the Lord let's keep our eyes on Christ sister Janine you come up for your testimony [Music] good morning felle bear with me I hate public speaking um we are really blessed in this church to have the teaching and the leadership that we have and we're all aware of that and we're all grateful for that but I became aware of something really small to be grateful for for this church um our Christmas gift we get one every year it's just routine for us we're grateful for it and we're blessed to have it but we kind of expect to get something from the church I just thought that was normal for all churches but this the Monday after we got that from the church I was talking to a couple of ladies that go to church that I work with their churches give them nothing like Christmas and so they're always surprised when I say you know oh my church blessed me with this at Christmas this was our gift this year and they're like really and I was like yes and you know I really didn't think anybody I was grateful for it but I really didn't think anything about it Beyond saying thank you Jesus and but they're like they don't get anything from their churches they don't get a thank you they don't get a card they don't get fruit they get nothing from their churches from CHR for Christmas and it's like they get all of their TI give their ties to the church but the church really doesn't return anything to them extra they you know so I was like really blessed I just want to say that I'm grateful for that that that was really a big blessing that we have in this church that I'm really grateful for the second thing that I want to be blessed tell y'all been blessed with is the job that I was provided with when I moved to Georgia a little over three years ago it's really good company um they give us a merit raise it is in their things written up saying when you sign on from the company that they're guaranteeing you a merit raise every year and a bonus every year they don't tell you how much but they basically say that you will get a cost of living raise every year that's just the way it is which I'm really grateful for because a lot of companies don't do that but this year I not only got my Merit raise which was good I got a huge bonus above what the company usually gives which I'm really thankful for I was able to send that to Nicole and pay off the Disney trip that she asked me to help her take the kids on in February um and then on top of that I got a new job title and with that new job title I got another 4% raise on top of my Merit so I just really wanted to say that God not only bless me with a company good company to work for that has continued to appreciate me but every year God puts it in their heart to give me a little something extra that shows me that they appreciate me so I just wanted to say God thank you for that am brother Ryan you want to come on up FR amen for God bless you all uh sister June suggested we sing this song or requested it from that uh ladies I think it was from the L's Retreat and uh but we ask youall to help us sing along and if the brothers if the people in the back can project the song if you have the lyrics it's called listen to our hearts how do you explain how do you [Music] describe a love that goes from east to west runs as deep as it is why you know all our hopes you know all our fears words cannot express the love we feel but we long for you to hear so listen to our hearts here our spirit sing a song of Praise that flows from those you have [Music] redeemed and we will use the words we know to tell you what an awesome God you are but when words are not enough to tell you of our love just listen into our hearts if words could fall like rain from these lips of mine and if I had a thousand years I would still run out of time if you listen to my heart Every Beat would sing thank you for the life thank you for the truth thank you for the way so listen to our hearts hear our spirit sing a song of Praise that flows from those you have redeemed and we will use the words we know to tell you what an awesome God you are but when words are not enough to tell you of our love just listen to our heart amen God bless you sister Regina forgive the interruption but just right quick I want to share it with everybody all at one time Arline y'all know who he is my ex-husband he has Alzheimer's I was speaking to him a couple of days ago he doesn't know who I am so if anybody has had anybody in their family or been close to who has that disease remember us in prayer please and especially Kendrick who shut it down when we got

uh you know the bride is just so wonderful no matter where she's from no matter how far away she's from you just meet them and you just have a connection and we're so grateful for the love of God and uh it's been about a year and a half or so since we we've been here and uh we'd like to you know we miss brother Samuel Dell we appreciate his stand for this message for all them years but you know he went on to his reward he went on to his reward but we're still here fighting we're still in a fight and we've got to put our shoulder to the wheels with our brothers and sisters and keep fighting keep marching on in the truth because he stood for this truth we're fighting for this truth and if there's another generation there's going to be another generation these young people that when we go on to our reward they'll be fighting for the same truth we certainly appreciate appreciate the church and uh sister Peggy we love you with all of our hearts certainly pray for you as well as sister June God bless you so good to see you and Contin remember brother Wade is and brother Lis and Sister Christine is they on the mission field looking for that last one we can't go home till they come in and it doesn't matter if fits in in in Central America or if it's in China or if it's in Lula Georgia we've got to find that last one so we can go home so weer love you we bring you greetings from brother Ron Brother Andrew Spencer from the church Full Gospel lighthous Tabernacle in Virginia uh we believe the same message we're fighting the same devil and we'll all be in the same Rapture so he certainly appreciates all the prayers and the fight that he's in there with cancer and I tell you what you know the doctors initially gave him four months to live you know imagine feeling all right and all of a sudden you get a certain pain and you go to the doctor and all of a sudden you've got four months to live what that what that does to you and how that tests you you know and God's been good with he's going I believe on like five years and God's been faithful God uses doctors amen there're certainly thankful for that brother Boyd is an example so good to see you our dear brother and how God uses doctors to catch things and and uses hands of doctors to pull us through things amen God anoints real doctors to take care of us so God bless you we're not going to keep you standing but if you just turn the scriptures to me with me rather we'll go to go to the word Matthew 18 ver verse one the second one will be in Matthew 23 so we'll be in the Book of Matthew but we'll begin with Matthew the 18th chapter beginning there at the first verse don't you love the Lord amen he's so good to us that you know Satan would tell you he's not good to you but we know better he's good to us if you're here right now breathe in Air he's good to you amen the scripture reading at the same time came the disciples unto Jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and Jesus called a little child unto him and he set him in the midst of them now notice Jesus didn't say bring me caiaphus bring me a Pharisee he didn't say bring come here Peter he said bring me a child and he said verily I say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven think about that you got God in flesh he he brings a child and he said he you talk about a sermon all the the the great officers in the religion of the land and Jesus says except you become brother Bob as this little child you will in no wise enter the Kingdom of Heaven in Matthew 23: 11 but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be a based and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted so we're fa with two choices if we exalt ourselves even in our own thinking God's going to make sure that we're humbled but if we within our own selves humble ourselves and we realize that we are nothing then God's going to come behind and exalt you amen amen let's bow our heads dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you with all of our hearts we thank you Lord for these moments in your presence we thank thank you for our brothers and sisters oh God that have gathered together Lord under Lord the authority of your word we just ask that you just forgive us of our sins speak to our hearts our hearts are open and if they're not may you open them Lord that the spoken word which is the Original Seed may come into our hearts and bring forth the fruit of the word we ask you be with each need Lord you heard every request and every concern and you know every burden that's on the heart father I pray that you grant meet each and every need Lord you heard oh God the cry about the prodical and father we just send your spirit and Lord many times we pray we may not see that you're working but just because we don't see it doesn't mean you're not we love you and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you may take your seats in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ with the help of the Lord this morning I'd like to title this sermon humble yourself the Way Up Is Down you know the word of God is so often so contradictory to the human way of thinking because we think it's you know how can something how can I how can I put myself down and actually end up being up but that is the way that God has set in the in the sermon love brother R said we know so much God dwells in the center of humility and simplicity don't never forget that and you know in this end time God has blessed us and and send us a message M and there's so much truth and there's so much reality and there's so much Revelation there's so much power in this message it's important that in order that we harness and really benefit from all the power and the Revelation and the understanding and and the authority of the message it's important brother Ryan that we don't forget the basics because without the basics and you say well well preacher what do you mean by the basics the basics of love and how powerful love is and the the basics of humility and how no matter what God ever does for you whether he does for you in the natural realm or in the spiritual realm it is important that we always remain humble about it now to be humble is not to deny what God has done for you but in in in a way of how you perceive yourself of how we perceive ourselves we're always to make sure and we're always to double check and make sure that we remain very humble because as brother Bob even mentioned in the Sunday School lesson God hides in Simplicity but then he reveals himself in the very same thing he's hiding in Satan loves to make the new birth complicated he does he loves to make healing complicated he loves to make forgiveness complicated he loves to make it complicated for you to even forgive yourself brother sometimes we get so hung up on the past and what we did and it's already in the sea of God's forgivness but God's waiting on you to forgive yourself because if he forgave you and he does but yet you can't forgive yourself you're keeping your own self from developing and growing so it's time that we go back to Simplicity now Revelation it when sometimes whenever as as whether you hear the prophet or the ministry preach the word and it seems to be so complicated to you then it's not a real Revelation to you yet because Revelation is simple sir whenever Jesus came and he asked Peter who do you say that I the son of man am it was not complicated to Peter but yet it was such a deep mysterious revelation God hid it from the wise and prudent but yet he revealed it to Bab such as would learn and you see the order of the scripture where where where Jesus whenever Paul make or excuse me whenever Peter makes a confession and Jesus said you know Upon This Rock Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it I imagine that made Peter feel pretty good you know he didn't have the new birth yet so he might have his his brothers might have been quite impressed that wow Peter's got some Revelation but you find that a few verses later Jesus is saying the son of man's got to go to Jerusalem to be crucified and Peter begins to start rebuking him and what does Jesus say get thee behind me Satan yes sir right well John might have looked and said Peter I thought Peter was revelated now Jesus is is calling him Satan but see Peter was whenever Peter was talking about Jesus being who he was and and Jesus clarified or or or confirmed that he was correct and Upon This Rock Peter was got in a spiritual Channel but then Peter got carnal again and Jesus wasn't calling Peter Satan he was calling the spirit speaking through Peter trying to keep him from going to the Cross now humility the the definition here just to to to make sure we all have the understanding is the feeling or attitude that you have no special importance that makes you better than others it's the lack of Pride that within ourselves we're not to walk around and think I'm better than them people I'm better than this person I'm better than that you're not I'm not if there's anything good about us it's because of him amen now the sincerity and humility go go right hand in hand because the sincerity is a quality of being or state of being sincere honesty of Mind freedom from hypocrisy so we're to be sincere and what did the angel tell the tell the prophet when he seen that the vision of the mama there he said you've got to be more sincere and if the angel of God told the prophet messenger he's got to be more sincere then I believe we have got to be more sincere more sincere is a briide more sincere as individuals now again humility does not belittle you or take away from who you are but it keeps the carnal perception of ourselves in check that's what humility does okay because there's a spiritual aspect that that we have to understand who we are that is what the ministry does and to preach and to remind the bride who you are but there's a special part of that and it's in him amen because in ourselves we're nothing so see there there's it's to keep the human Spirit and the Flesh in check to make us think that we're somebody but whenever we get in the spirit we realize that we're nothing and it's all about him when we get on the other side it's not about how big your crown is and how many gems it's got and how shiny it is and how loud oh you know the the the the Applause will be there's only one thing we want to hear it was well done thou good and faithful servant that's all it doesn't matter then as long as you fulfilled your God's desire and God's will in your life that's all that matters God's will for your life may not be to minister the word it may not be to play an instrument it may be to amen the word amen and and it may be your faith that God anoints you with and yet your faith you're sitting in the back corner and your faith is pulling on the gifts of God right and because your faith is pulling on the gift of God somebody gets their healing up here you see you have a part in every single service in every single service you have a part now this this this this constantly we have to check ourselves is for the young people people it's for the middle AG it's for the elderly it's for all age groups we must humble ourselves more than ever amen we must keep in constant check Lord am I pleasing you we have to open up every door of the heart now in the sermon what when he out to see brother R speaking he says now a lot of people has the wrong impression of Christ some people thinks that Christ was a Christ was the greatest of all men he was the example man Not only was he man but he was God man he was God With Us Emanuel he was humblest of men but you can be too humble you can get so humble until the devil would make a puppet Out of You Now understand this humility come on okay is this good all right thank you humility is not weakness on when the prophet is speaking of here is that people well bless God that Satan is trying to take away my my child from under under under under the token and or I'm claiming the token he don't have the Holy Ghost and Satan's trying to take him away but I'm just so humble I I I don't want to get angry at the Devil Satan is trying to attack my body with sickness but I'm just so humble God humility is not weakness humility is allowing yourself to be done wrong by others and Still Loving them and still forgiving them that's humility but yet when it came time when it came time for Jesus to fulfill the word he went straight to the Cross when it came time for Jesus to cast out the money changers he got right to work but yet he was so humble and he was so Meek he goes on he says he was humble enough to wash the disciples feet he was forgiving enough to pray for those who drove Stakes into his hands but he was man enough to Plat ropes and to run the money changers out of the house yet he loved he's our ultimate example When Jesus washed the disciples feet do you realize that Jesus washed Judas is the Kat's feet after he served the Passover and and no doubt none of none of the he Jesus even said this is my body which is broken for you and he began to go down the line of communion and Judas was there yet he had such love and such humility none of the other disciples Jesus told them Point Blank he who dips the soop that's who betrays me and they still didn't get it because of his love and humility and then he begins to to wash the disciples feet and Peter and John and Matthew and then he goes to Judas is a carat and washed his feet knowing that the next time them feet are going to move is going to be to betray him but he was no pushover Jesus knew exactly who Judas was he knew who Judas was when he called him so now there's a difference between hump being humble and a coward a coward is actually afraid but a humble person is brave and very capable and does what's necessary but they don't go about bragging about it right you look at Saul versus David Saul looked apart but he was a coward brother bam said so here you have David who was capable but after he killed Goliath he didn't go around he went back he went back to his father's house and then Saul would have him at at the castle or the palace and so forth but he didn't go around bragging about it so David was humble with it so that the the strain of Fallen man is always a desire the new birth that's why we have to be born again is always to have more or be better at something than the next person now playing in sports and competing and you want you know you're a good sport of course you're going to try to win this isn't saying don't even try and win but this is our approach to life we must always remain humble if God anoints you and you're anointed to sing or you're anointed to play an instrument or you're anointed to minister you're anointed to do whatever it may be we have to be humble about it Mary Magdalene there were seven Devils cast out of Mary Magdalene and brother Ram actually points out too as being pride and envy that she thought she was so pretty there was no one like her Satan knows where to try and hit you he knows where to hit you he knows where your weak spots are and he knows and and and that's the thing is that whenever like for example whenever somebody says something to you that's not very nice or you don't appreciate whether they realize it or not you have to let it roll off like water on a duck's back we've all heard that expression let it roll off because if you let it soak in then that begin then Satan latches itself on that because remember a cancer is a bruised cell and when one brother BR would say that the cell would backslide and when it would begin to backslide they would it would start to spread and start building on top of one another well that's what complexes do that's what even if it was genuinely a wrong word spoken if you don't let it slide off it will then become a bruised hurt cell in you're a human spirit and then Satan comes beyond that behind that and he'll attach this to it and then he'll attach that to it and then he'll attach that to it and before you know it you've got a network of of complexes so you have to let it roll Let It Roll right into the blood of Jesus Christ and keep yourself pure because if if if we keep things in our heart and then we come in and and and and we hear the word if you if if we have that on our hearts you cannot grow you'll stay right there unforgiveness will kill your prayers that's from the words of Jesus Christ himself right just like on the other side of that whenever somebody pays you a compliment and tells you you did wonderful appreciate it but then let it roll you're a wonderful singer you bless my heart you you touch my soul give God the glory let it roll that was the most wonderful sermon I've ever heard you're my favorite preacher give God the glory Let It Roll because just like complexes will build up so will pride and then Pride will then turn to arrogancy and then it'll go from that was such a wonderful song you did so great you sang so wonderful and you let it hold on to you and then the next time something else builds the next time something else builds and before you know it you're the best singer in the church how dare they call that person up there and saying they didn't call me don't they know that I get people blessed you see Satan will build on that we've got to keep oursel humble let it roll off because when you really get in the presence of God when you really get in the presence of God you will quickly realize it's all about him you will quickly realize that worship is not how well you can sing how if you dance or if you don't if you speak in tongues or if you don't you really realize that it's all about him amen church is all about him Heaven is all about him him it's all him like brother said he said get a cup of water and fill it up with water and then you put your finger in there and you take it out and see where the hole is he said that's how important you are that's how important we are naturally speaking in First Peter 5 P first Peter 5:5 likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the Elder yay all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility this is Peter saying this Peter had to learn this for God resisteth the proud and he giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he carth for you in the sermon perfect strength by Perfect weakness he said I hope that gets down deep to us both here in the tape world too that you realize that you you've got to become nothing not a know-it-all not a great somebody but a nobody you got to become dust you got to get to a place where you know that you're nothing and don't never rise above that for as soon as you rise above it you rise above God you've got to keep yourself in the dust and on the road to Damascus you've got to keep yourself off your high horse from the poorest of us to the richest of us from the least to the greatest we keep God out of our Lives because of our own selves I've often said the greatest enemy I've got is William brandham he's the one that gets in God's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shoves God right out of the picture but when I get rid of that guy when I get to a place that he's out of the way then God can come over and do things William brandham knows nothing about that's when God can use you that's that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody when we get out of his way but as long as we got ourselves in the way then we cannot this message does not teach us to exclude one another this message teaches us to draw a circle bigger remember that preacher that came to brother brandom and said well I I'm I'm drawing a circle and you're out because of his Doctrine what did the prophet say he said I'll draw a circle and draw you right back in because if we're if we're if we're drawing circles and we're trying to cut people out how do you know that you're not actually wrong right and the person that you're cutting out could help you if you would only make the circle bigger or maybe you could help them amen big you could help them if you kept the circle bigger then they don't quite see it like I do something that's it come on you see we have to Humble ourselves Lord if I'm wrong then you help me amen but if I can help that brother or sister then you help me help them and help me humble myself and not not you know not walk around with a spirit of arrogancy now brother speaking of St Martin he said talking about what a great man he was and he says yet in the very secret of his power was in humility before God that's the secret of power is humility and we find today that the church yet teaching its power and teaching the signs to follow the believer yet we find them puffed out big me little you it isn't like that in the early church they were humble kind to one another and sweet in understanding amen that if somebody is wrong if you meet them out in the street they're your coworker yet your atmosphere is so powerful and so convicting it draws them they may not have a clue what you believe but yet the the the atmosphere and the humility and the love that you walk in they don't know what you have but they want it it then begins to create a thirst in their lives that's true Christianity it's the the word of God is yes there's Doctrine and yes there's Revelation and it changes our heart it sets our soul on fire we're ready to go in the Rapture but yet at the end of the day if you if it's not shared in love if it's not lived out in humility then what good does it do it's got to have power behind it the word the the message has got power the message has got the authority the message is the life of Jesus Christ it is the gospel it is the Original Seed it's everything but yet in order the message has got to live the message is not to be weaponized and to cut one another it's to cut the enemy it's it's it's to be brought and believed in love and humility and to bring the elect lady in correction and in Purity it's to keep us pure the prophet said whenever we walk through the doors in case I don't get to that quote he said the reason that we should come to church is to find out where are our faults not will the minister entertain us today will my favorite singer be singing today will will the preacher preach something I've never heard before where am I falling short and how can I be more like Jesus because then if you realize that we're brother Bob if we are constantly Lord where am I falling short then we're not worried about where this person's falling short or that person's falling short it's where am I falling short and as the word Goes Forth if if that's why we have to come to church with an open heart because if we come with an Open Heart Lord show me where I'm wrong we could be doing something that's wrong and displeasing and have no idea we don't know but then as the word begins to come forth it begins to prick your heart if your heart is open because remember in the parable the F whenever Jesus is talking about the seed and how some fell on good ground and some fell on Rocky ground and all these things you you know the parable it's important every single one of us fall in one of them categories some fell on good ground you know some fell on rocks but it's important important that during the week we prepare our heart to hear the word it's important that come youall have a midweek service but in all week start praying for Wednesday night service on Thursday start praying for Sunday service because you're preparing you're tilling your heart if you wait till you walk through them doors to start getting ready for service and and you had a bad day on the job and a bad day with a neighbor and your your spirits all all crusted over and hard ground how's the seed going to get in there but when all week you we water it with praise and we keep it tilled up and we stay in the word and we stay under conviction of the word we're ready for church we're ready for the word to speak amen he said in the unwelcomed Christ he said you know what I've noticed this in my travels you usually find Great Men or little men now he he's talking about well you you you'll see he's not just talking naturally here I'll go around where there's great men really great men and I know they're great men but when I start to leave them they make you think you're the great man and they ain't nothing I guarantee you that if any one of us would go meet brother brandom if he was still here in the flesh you would leave after you spoke with him for just a few minutes brother Bob you would leave feeling like man it meant the world to him that he just spoke to me and Jesus is the same way he got that from Jesus to to to be like man I can't wait to to meet Jesus I I can't wait to speak you know you can imagine you were waiting if this was a brandom meeting and it is but if brother R Was Here In the Flesh and and and and he would come and you would just wait brother Bob to just meet him and shake his hand and yet when he spoke to you he felt like he was he would make you feel like he was the one waiting and that's not to exalt the man that was in his humility sir the love of God that was in him and that's in the bride then begins to raise you up you're actually the one that's edified when these brothers get up to preach and they're preaching and they study and they pray they find the mind of the Lord and they're all worn out and the devil has them tore up on Monday you're being you were blessed on Monday right you can go rejoicing on Monday what God did for you in the weekend when they had turmoil you see it was it's the spirit of Christ in them lifting by the word of the Lord lifting you up and you benefit from it because it's the body ministering to the body he said but you take a little 2x4 don't know nothing he thinks he's all of it he ain't nothing to begin with he said it's great men are little men they never brag or take honor they make you feel that you're great that's great men and no doubt there's people and that's that goes for brothers and sisters there's people in our lives that we can look to and and and and and think about that maybe they already gone on to meet with to to be with the Lord but that's what kind of person they were think of the testimony and the Legacy that they leave behind athletes and and people in Hollywood and so-called influencers think they leave a legacy behind because of this score or this many fights won or whatever stats that perish a real Legacy is the legacy of Jesus Christ whenever you have a Praying Mother or a Praying father or a pastor that preaches for decades goes on to be with the Lord but the influence of what of his Works still follow that's a real Legacy brother Samuel Dell has got a legacy amen and here's the proof of the Legacy and you see it came through the word now God knows we we all how many fight a devil fight Satan we fight him every day he don't take a day off and neither should you Christians don't have days off so God will allow and he and he allows things in our lives and things that we have to fight and it may not be the same thing our whole lives it may be but there's always a battle why is there always a battle because you've got to always be humble amen that's right you know you start you start allowing yourself a to get uplift a little bit God will send something and then you got to start fighting right just like with Paul God gave him such Revelation he wrote most of the New Testament yet God allowed him a messenger of Satan to come and bother his eyes why he even admitted to keep him humble to keep him low unless he be exalted see it's still that human nature that we all have to fight because our soul our our excuse me our bodies and human Spirits are not redeemed yet so our souls that's that's where that's where where we have the weapons to fight so God allows things in our lives to keep us humble and some times things happen in life and it just Bob brother Bob it just takes so much out of you and but God ain't done yet he's still crushing and then more more oil comes out as it were more uh weakness or you know more more more tears more travail comes out of you and you say God I think I passed this but no you didn't not yet it's God humbling you it's God keeping you humble it's god making us humble now another sermon if you can listen to it is the perfect strength by Perfect weakness is very powerful but he says quite early on in the sermon he says the important thing one of the most important things that we must Master now remember this and especially you young preachers and lay members alike there's one thing we've got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life that is we have to master the thought of human ability I can do this I can do that you've got to master that you can't do it but yet you can do all things through Christ you see how you've got to do it through him he said and make he said if we ever get to a spot where we think we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities we've got to master in such a way that we get rid of that thing and lay it aside so that God can use us and it's a human struggle to conquer your own will and your ambition and your desires because as as humans we make plans we have Ambitions it's you know as long as it's in check it's good to be ambitious you most certainly don't want to be lazy that's terrible you want to be ambitious and L you know go out and and do things but you always want to keep that in check with God's will in your life and if it's God's will in your life even if you don't you know God Will Make A Way and then you can do all things so it so this idea and this thought this morning of humbling yourself and and realizing that we're nothing is not to put you down but it's to realize that we within our human abilities in ourselves elves are nothing but through him we're more than conquerors what is that John said greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world he didn't say greater are you the secret ingredient is him and he's humble and he's lovely and he's sweet and he's kind and he's corrective and he's the word and he's the truth and he's the way and he's the life but all these are secret elements and secret ingredients in the life of a holy ghost filled person that the world don't understand Jesus Christ was the rose of Sharon he was the perfect Lamb of God but he was crushed on Calvary his life his three and a half year Ministry was a crushing constantly crushing am they try to Stone him here they spread rumors here from birth really the Bible doesn't cover his young life but I guarantee you what do you see what do you think happened at school when he went what do you think the other kids said about him in school born of a virgin yeah right he had to deal with that his whole life his whole life all the way in his ministry the the the Pharisees and things mention it but he understands the oppression you have at school so that when you young people can go to school and you young girls get bullied or or get taunted rather for your long beautiful hair or your dress he understands when you little boys or you young young men get get you know at college or whatever stage or season of life you're in you may get ridiculed or ask questions he understands he's been through all that Paul said in Galatians 220 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me Paul also said that he died daily he dies daily we've got to die every day every day you've got we've got to die in Proverbs 16:18 Pride goeth Before Destruction and a hotty spirit before a fall better is it to be of a humble spirit with the lowly than toi than to divide the spoil with the proud our minds go to King Uzziah he was a blessed man an old testament King there during the days of Isaiah he was a blessed man and he he was in his place and God blessed him with riches and authority and he was the king over Israel but then he began to be lifted up the Bible would say when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction God called him to be king and God blessed him in his place but he was so blessed and he would not humble himself so that then he began to be what else can I do what else can I do and as we know the story he he began he intruded into the priest's office and he went into the temple and the priest tried to stop him he went to go sa to make I believe it was to burn incense or to bring to bring yeah to burn incense and he was going to the priest try to stop him stop him but he said I'm King I can do what I want and he went in there and he he tried to fulfill the office of a priest and God struck him with Leprosy immediately and we know that leprosy is a type of sin so it's important that we stay in our place and that affect that affected Uzziah I'm sorry Isaiah so much that he that he had a vision the year that Uzziah died he saw the Lord sitting on a throne Isaiah 61 upon a throne high and lifted up and his train fill the temple see what when when that happened to Uzziah That Shook Isaiah up they were very good friends that shook Isaiah up so much he then begin to examine his own place before God and he begin to have a vision and he seen God and you know s High and lifted up on his throne he begin to see the order of the chair and all the worship that was going for him and the in the worship and in verse 5 then said I woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of un of of a people of unclean lips Isaiah begin to Humble himself being a word Prophet he's the one that gave the prophecy of a virgin shall con see and yet whenever he seen God and he realized that it was actually all about him the seraphim the Train the temple the whole Temple that they had there where Uzziah went to try and was struck down with lepry all that reflected him Moses's Temple reflected him the Ark of the Covenant reflects him the Mana reflects him Moses was to build a tabernacle and he did after a pattern of what he seen in and what God showed him it's all about him whenever the 12 tribes were set in the wilderness they were gathered around the ark around him whenever he came to Earth he had 12 disciples that were gathered around him it's all about him now there's so much power and and we're going to try and go a little quicker just for the sake of time here but the power of humility is so powerful when we humble ourselves that it even helps the the wicked you say what do you mean Ahab was became an enemy to God and he went and he stole nebo's Vineyard and and and and Jezebel went and Rose up false Witnesses and stoned and killed an innocent man a man that refused to sell his father's inheritance his inheritance the land of his fathers he refused to sell his inheritance amen and Jezebel and Ahab comes and he mopes around and and Jezebel ask him what's wrong he won't eat and he just got the wowy wowy Woos and Jezebel said you you just hang tight here I'll get that I'll get that that Vineyard for you and she went and had two worshippers of bail come and and and you know come up false witness and the elders they stoned Ahab and then Elijah he could they couldn't hide from God Elijah came and pronounced judgment and told Ahab that the dogs would lick your blood and the dogs would eat Jezebel and yet that that that because Ahab was an Israelite a backsliding Israelite and that prophecy he knew Elijah's prophecy was right he knew it was going to come to pass and he he began to Humble himself before God now God wasn't going to change his word of what he already said but Ahab humbling himself so much that God actually sent Elijah back and said because he humbleth himself before me I will not bring the evil in his days but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house so Ahab who became an enemy to God humbled himself and had a little reprieve how about when when you as a son or a daughter of God humble yourself before God God had humble Moses 40 years man put all that into him and it took God 40 years to take it out of them and at the end of that 40 years he was finally ready to be an empty vessel and go down and fulfill the word of God in Second Kings the scripture tells us of a story by a widow woman let's read 2 Kings 4:1 now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the Creditor is come to take unto him my son take unto him my two sons to be bondmen and Elisha said unto her what shall I do for thee tell me what H has thou in thy house and she said thine handmaid hath not anything in the house save a pot of oil then he said go borrow the vessels of all thy neighbors even empty vessels borrow not a few and when thou art come in then shalt thou shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons and and thou shalt pour into all those vessels and th shalt set aside that which is full so she went from him and shut the door upon her and her sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out and it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there is not a vessel more and the oil stayed then she came and told the man of God and he said go sell the oil and pay thy debt and live thou on thy Children of the rest she had to find empty vessels and that's what God wants he wants empty vessels not he don't want half full vessels where we put in our own ideas and our own understanding and our own preconceived ideas he wants empty vessels and in order for us to be empty vessels we've got to Humble ourselves we've got to become humble Lord I'm nothing everything I think I know I don't now now when God gives you Revelation it's yours don't misunderstand me it is yours and you have that Revelation but everything that I I'm so revelated I think I know God I don't know as I ought to know help me fill me with your word the prophet of God said oh God's strategy is to take empty human vessels and shake the world with them he wants to take empty human vessels and shake your family with it to shake your community to shake your co-workers let us be that empty vessel empty and humble so that he can pour oil and then we leave church we're full next weekend or Wednesday night we're empty again fill us back up on Sunday we're empty again you humble yourself and that's how you move on with God that is how you reach because God can have a a will and he can have a desire for our lives but we get in our way we get in his way think of what God can do with us as individuals and in our individual lives if we would humble ourselves more and that's from the front to the back and from side to side that's all of us on the days of Pentecost and disciples after Jesus went back to Heaven they had 10 days to empty out they had to become empty vessels you can see how whenever Jesus went brother Bob on the mountain Transfiguration and and with with J with Peter and J James and John and and he was transfigured and he seen Moses and Elijah you can see how Peter was still full Lord let us build a tabernacle here one for Moses one for Elijah one for you he had his own ideas still but on the days of Pentecost he emptied out and when the Holy Ghost came he was able to then say this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel then he was able to walk by the by the lame man at the gate called beautiful and said Silver and Gold Have I none but such as I have I give to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ rise up and walk and you could be sitting here in your own condition and whatever it may be and it can be a lame condition you're not walking to your full potential but let the word of God this morning say silver and gold to fix your problems Have I None but such as I have the word of God I give to you in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk it may not be healing it may what it may be a mind battle it may be something that you need may need the joy of the Lord in your heart you may need the joy of your salvation restored but in the name of Jesus Christ I give it unto you rise up and walk empty vessels that's what he wants when there were 120 empty vessels waiting on him how that must have made God feel to have 120 empty vests was that when he came down he filled each and every one of them nobody left that service empty nobody left that service saying well I didn't get nothing why because they were all empty there's something for us in each and every service even if it's just a little bit and that's what you need to watch for it may be the the interpretive reading that the brother gets up and reads may be something in the brother's prayer when he prays it may be in the song that the sister sings or the brother sing it may be in what the minister says there's something for you in every service but we have to Humble ourselves to get it to get what God has for us he said you know people want power this is in the sermon humble thyself and really they don't know what power is they don't really know what goes with it the Way Up Is Down always Now understand P God gives gifts and he gives gifts sovereignly and they're without um they're without repentance but when a person has a gift in their life that requires that much more steadfast of humility because the gift didn't come from them but Satan will make try and make you think that gift did come from you and you've got to always keep that covered because to whom much is given much is required you think of the humility there was no accident that brother R was so humble or Moses the Bible specifically said that Moses was so humble but he talked face to face with God he literally had the pillar of fire come down the Finger of God and write the Ten Commandments and stone he's seen that he's seen he's seen the back part of the man he's seen so much be it he had to constantly stay humble the prophet of God would would see such things because of his gift he would have brother Ryan people come behind him and Pat him on the shoulder and say I love you brother brand and he would know they wouldn't but he still had to love him and no one ever knew brother Billy Paul testified one time he said I knew my dad so well he said when somebody invited him to go fishing go hunting or invite him to meetings he could tell by the prophet's response he could tell by the prophet's response if he meant Billy get me out of this Billy I'd like to do it Billy maybe or Billy get this done ASAP that's how he knew his dad that well but yet he said one thing I never knew is a different between his enemies and his friends that's powerful a man that was so gifted by God that he could that he could look into your life and he could know if you were really sincere he know if you're a real believer and he would know when a hypocrite would come and tell him how much he loved him knowing he despised him and couldn't stand them but he still treated him with such so cordial now I'm not here to uplift the man but I am up here to uplift the god in the man and I'm also here to uplift the god in you that you can with a God in you we can all humble ourselves more because the human element can't but the god element can see he says if you want Power see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking and just and humble yourself before God God and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a lot of noise because you've been able to conquer yourself commit yourself to Christ see to humble yourself before him that's really power you showed me a church that's humble not real humble not an arrogancy a church just a sweet Humble Church church I'll show you a church that has the favor and power of God that's why he said he'd rather have rather than having a church with all the nine spiritual gifts constantly working he'd rather have a church that's just full of love amen because if there's no love to control the gifts there'll be competition there'll be arrogancy there'll be Pride but if there's love God can use you God God can use you God can use you God can use you and then when he's done using you you realize you're nothing and if he wants to use you you realize you're nothing but Lord if you want to use me I'm here for you but it's all about you that principle has got to work in marriage too and in your family the principle of humility and putting others first if you don't have that when you get married you're for a very rough time right now there's no big eyes and little use in the body of Christ right just like you shouldn't we shouldn't love our children one more than the other there's no big eyes or big use it's all about him God is the one that ordains things to be done by certain people but it's all him we don't want to ever get an arrogant spirit we know that arrogance is whenever we think we're better than somebody else the realization whenever we come to church and we hear the word preach and we just latch on to that and amen praise God we realize that and we realize we're elect and that is you know you hear the prophet make statements about when John seen his name in the book that's how you see your name in the book your name in the book isn't every seventh letter every eighth letter from this chapter to this chapter I see my name spelled out like it's some code yeah you see your name in the book whenever you identify and you believe the word for your age Which is far greater than you know having your literal name in the days of William Aaron Brandon when he shall begin a sound the voice of the mysteries of God should be finished well how many William Mary and Brams would there be but there's only one that could come with the life and the ministry and then it's our and then it's our God's grace Upon Our Lives that makes us realize that's the Elijah just like when Jesus came to Earth it wasn't Jesus Christ of Nazareth there were hints dropped but it was not Behold a virgin shall conceive with Jesus Christ of Nazareth and then he's going to go here and he's going to do this he's going to do that there could have been carnal man that tried to make that happen but when he came yes sir the generation of that day that identified Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God that proved their election so when we realize that it's a humbling experience that God out of out of seven billion people on the Earth not only saved me but he elected me to be part of his bride I can see this and maybe my own family can't my own co-workers people I love can't see it but I see it that is a very humbling experience because you realize who am I what about people that are more qualified what about people that came from a good home and here I came from a broken home I came off the streets I came I you know I I came from the worst condition and possibility there was in life right and yet you have people that were raised in the most perfect good homes that are living very evil lives be it God calls them from here and he calls them from there but you realize in humility that we're nothing we should have the ability to Humble ourselves and receive the word regardless of who it comes through if it's your favorite preacher or if it's your not favorite preacher we should have the ability to discern that's God speaking to me that you that that's humble that's humble God I don't care who speaks it I don't care if a child says something to me on the way up I don't care who says it I don't care if it's through a song but God you spoke to me the person never has to know you can tell them that'll encourage them I don't now don't get me wrong it encourages ministers to know that their seron blessed you remember brother B meeting was being complimented on a sermon and another preacher no doubt jealous said bless God I won't want them complimenting me and brother R looked to him he said there's only one difference between me and you I like he said I like it he said but there's one difference between me and you he said I'll admit it why but see again you appreciate it and you let it roll and the reason is because it gives whenever Minister speak speak something to your heart it encourages them to know that it spoke to your heart because there's plenty the devil tells them there's plenty the devil tells them the opposite way so if a child of God in all honesty and sincerity comes and says that blessed my heart today that equips them but then you let it roll because remember the wheat whenever it's still green it sticks straight up but whenever it begins to mature and all the greenness is baked out that head begins to Bow like this there was no greater man on the scene with more Revelation than brother brown but he was the most humble we don't walk around all puffed up and uplifted see the bride was been given very special Grace so we are to we should be able to be humble enough to give that Grace to others and not just to people in our own church but even to our neighbors and to other people we're not to walk around puffed up and uplifted well bless God I'm a message believer and all of you are Canon fathered that's not right this message is sent to the bride but there's lots tens of thousands millions throughout the ages that will be be there in heaven as saved there will be people in our generation that will be there saved that have never heard a tape right that I've never heard the message but yet God called you to escape the tribulation now they're going to have to go through tribulation and there's there's process they're going to have to be at the white Throne judgment and God's going to give them eternal life they're going to enter there cuz he's that kind of merciful god so that's you know you work with other people you act with people and they're such good people and they love God and they serve God the best of their abilities well don't don't cut them out they may not be bride but we should never put them down God has an economy in the scripture Jesus refers to a story between a Publican a Publican were Tax Collectors Tax Collectors are never liked brother John you're you said you were an accountant you're just a middleman there but the actual tax collector nobody sends the IRS a Christmas gift has anybody done that nobody enjoys it so imagine the publicans were many times Jews that actually collected taxes that made it even worse it's one thing that to be a Jew and you have to go up and you got to pay the Roman system taxes but whenever the the kid you grew up in school actually is now your tax collector oh man that that's hard they were looked on with contempt they were ordinary the the I looked this up online but ordinary taxes such as land taxes were collected by the Roman officials but toll taxes for transporting goods were usually collected by Jews under contract with the Romans they were looked at as Traders now that was Matthew Matthew was a Publican he was a tax collector and Jesus chose him so Jesus tells the story here about a Publican and about it was like a a religious person and one went down and he went and he he went to the temple to pray and he he went and he went there all arrogant he said God I'm so thankful I'm not a murderer I'm so thankful I'm not like this person I'm not like that person and I see a Publican over there I'm so glad I'm not like that guy man not a traitor to my country thank you Lord I'm not amen and he just walks out just his stuff shirt and as aun as ever but yet you have that Publican that was sitting there in the corner and he so humbled himself he felt bad for what he was doing and he so humbled himself the scripture said that he wouldn't even look up to heaven he was so humble he had his head down he said Lord I'm not even worthy to look up and Jesus said he said and the Publican standing a far off would not so much as lift up his eyes into heaven but smoted his breath saying God be merciful to me a sinner I tell you this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other for everyone that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted he humbled himself we're coming up on Christmas time and we know that Jesus wasn't born on Christmas day but we take it as a day of worship and we we just begin to appreciate we take time the prophet said you you could do it if you want to do it in April do it if you want but Christmas because of of the tradition and how it's been that's usually the time we really stop to think about it and it should be a day of worship and we thank God for what he did because had there been no Christmas there'd be no Easter and had there been no Easter there wouldn't be us but that is the he is the most ultimate example of humility as we come to a close you see as we read the vision that Isaiah had of him so holy the seraphim and how they worshiped him and and and you know holy holy holy constantly and yet a god like that would leave that environment brother Bob that all of Heaven to brother Terence to come down in flesh flesh is humiliating our flesh is humiliating and you especially realize that as you change seasons of life and Jesus aged he had the humiliation of of of the Aging he had the humiliation of sickness because he bore our infirmities Jesus got sick he might have just healed somebody of leprosy and he might have walked away with a with a migraine because he bore her infirmities but he came from glory to Earth so that we could go from Earth to Glory brother called it a super sign when he said Jehovah was crying in a Manger in a barn from glory to the barn he suffered pain he suffered disappointments sickness Temptation he washed the disciples Dirty Feet brother man preached a sermon called Pride whenever that Pharisee had Jesus come and invited him because that Pharisee was arrogant and he wanted to show all of his his friends all of his social standing that were very curious about Jesus they wanted he wanted to put on a show for them and he purposely left Jesus there with dirty feet Jesus didn't even leave he didn't storm up he didn't chew him out he didn't get in his face he didn't go even wash his own feet he just sat there humble because what you have to realize is Jesus didn't go there for Simon the Pharisee when he was sitting down there he was waiting that's he knew why they invited him you think about this to be invited to a gathering by people that were acting to be your friends put yourself in his shoes you're invited to go to a gathering and yet everybody's making fun of you everybody's laughing at you everybody's talking about you and you know it not only humanly did he know it but he was God he knew what the thought thoughts were but yet he sat there any one of us would just leave we might as well leave that but he sat right there in humility because he was looking for a woman and when that woman came she had to Humble herself she had to Humble herself now she didn't have to Humble herself in the way of bringing of I'm So Elite and I'm so high class she had to Humble herself in a way of I'm so dirty he's going to know how I got this money but yet she had to get past her fight her own struggle to fight past that to get to his feet right so she had to Humble herself in that way to say I don't care he's going to know where I got this money but I've got to do this she had church because she she realized whenever she was washing his feet she realized that it was just her and him and it was all about him it wasn't about how messy my hair was getting it wasn't about how dirty my face was getting it was all about him may we this morning ask the Lord to Humble us more than ever before amen am be more humble be more sincere have more love because Isaiah tells us that we are all as an unclean thing and all of our righteousness are as filthy rags the best thing that we have that we could give him is as filthy rags in Isaiah 648 he says but now oh Lord Thou Art our father and we are the clay thou are our Potter and and we are the work of thy hand in Jeremiah 18:1 the word of the Lord came which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise and go down to The Potter's House and there I will cause thee to hear my words then I went down to The Potter's House and behold he wrought a work on the wheels and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the Potter so he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the Potter to make it we have to be remolded but it takes humility to do it you say well how how can I humble myself I have the desire to humble myself but how do I go about doing it it begins with repentance because for someone to get saved the first thing they have to do is stop and realize they're wrong admit they're wrong and turn around repent because whenever we repent and and you can sit here with the Holy Ghost for 30 years and we still have to repent because by repentance it's it's God's gift to us that we can keep ourselves clean we constantly keep ourselves washed out Lord I'm sorry if and then it can be even be sometimes things you can't put your finger on you know maybe you've kind of allowed Satan to attack you here and attack you there and you got to get that under the blood but sometimes you may not know so we open up our hearts brother R preached the door to the heart and we want to open up every door and he always went to that door of Pride and he said that's the big door right there but I want to say in the name of Jesus Christ Lord I open up my door of Pride and may you go in there and may you go in every door of my heart may he go in every door of your heart now here's the thing about Jesus in doors he'll knock on doors but he won't kick them in he's not he's not going to kick your door in but he'll knock he'll knock at this service and then you don't open it in the next service he'll be knocking again and you know the wonderful thing musicians can come on up the wonderful thing about our lord Jesus is that whenever we finally open the door and give up we're always so happy we did then it's like Lord I wish I would have done it sooner he wants to go in every door of our heart you know he said the prophet of God said talking about healing and love in 1 Corinthians 13 though I understand all Mysteries and though I you know my prayer faith heals the sick he said if I don't have love I'm nothing and brother R goes through the Beatitudes and he he speaks of those blessed are the poor in spirit for there is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God blessed are are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake let me even throw in the Forgotten beatitude blessed is he that's not offended in me he said you take the Beatitudes and you mix it with Mark 16 he said then you you got your healing right because all these require meekness the entire Plan of Redemption was botted up in one God man the Lord Jesus Christ there never was a man as humble and God help us this morning to be as humble as he was and it's not manufactured hum humility you get the spirit of Christ in you and it'll make you humble but you know the human Spirit In the Flesh that fights constantly that's where our Wars come from ain't that what James said from within us you have to extract humility from that Holy Ghost that God's given you that's where it comes from Brother Bob and sister Monica took us over there I can't pronounce the name of the of the Town donga Dela you can always tell when somebody's not local we can stand to our feet but he took us to a m there and and they showed you know how they used to kind of take out the gold and it was some intense work you know brother Bob and I were talking you know no matter how hard you think your job is now that was it's a cakewalk to what them poor guys had to do then you know but all that go was in the mountain and all they had to do was just keep chipping away keep chipping away and get that gold out the gold of God Is In You by the Holy Ghost and by the new birth but we've got to fight past our own flesh the laziness of our flesh we don't feel like praying we don't feel like reading we don't feel like studying we've got to fight through that we've got to fight through the human spirit amen to get to that inside man God bless you this morning pray something will said that encourage your heart we certainly love you we appreciate each and every one of you we appreciate the ministry here we appreciate you all and we love you um in case I don't get to shake your hand after the church just want to make sure I extend my love and appreciation for each and every one of you we kind of expecting some potential bad weather and ice so so we're not going to be able to stay too long after service but we love you with all of our hearts and we're thankful for each and every one of you amen God bless you turn the service back to brother Bob amen see what can happen when somebody humbles them themselves and and lets the Lord do something I I believe this morning we heard from the Lord speaking to us if we can just take those words to heart and humble ourselves I thinking while the brother was speaking that um Jesus Come into that that place where the uh Pharisee invited him and humbled himself like the brother was saying and did that because like the brother was talking about that he knew somebody was going to Humble themselves and come to him I wonder is if maybe just start playing something softly maybe maybe this morning God's drawing you think about all those times in scripture where to come to God you got to humble yourself like naamon there that dip myself seven times in the water go down in the muddy Jordan and dip myself but he did what Elijah told him to and he was healed the little wiow of zerath that you mean to tell me I got to make a cake of bread first but she humbled herself maybe this morning God is I I believe he's calling all of us to Humble ourselves and maybe if you've been putting off just emptying yourself out maybe now is the time see maybe maybe you thought church was over this morning but I think it's just getting started our brother was our brother was saying if you really want to have church if you're living to worship then humble yourself can we do that this morning humble oursel humble oursel like that little woman that knelt at jesus' feet when everybody was laughing at him and making fun but she humbled herself and broke that Alabaster Box cuz she did she wanted to leave everything behind and come to Jesus maybe the Lord is drawing you this morning and we've heard the word preached now it's time to reap the benefits so if you need something from God won you come step out in the aisle come forward and claim it our brother's standing here waiting to pray with you if you need a special touch from God now is
