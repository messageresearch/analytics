the author this afternoon Heavenly Father we thank you for this day Lord we thank you for your this opportunity Lord to be gathered with those of like Precious faith and father we just commit ourselves to you Lord we know that we're insufficient in ourselves Lord but you're the one that Lord you're the one that makes us sufficient in all things Lord and Lord each one that that's here tonight Lord you know each need each desire we just pray that you just come and touch each one here Lord the ones that couldn't be here tonight Lord you know all the needs and Lord we know that we just just commit them to you Lord because Lord we can't do anything in ourselves Lord but we can put our confidence in you and Lord we just pray that tonight Lord you just speak to us give us the word words of eternal life Lord give us what we have need of today and Lord there's so many that have needs and so many times Lord I I read online and there's so many that have needs and Lord is just it's hard to remember everybody Lord but you know who they are and L we just commit them to you in the name of Jesus Christ and Lord we lift up our our pastor brother Dale and sister Dale Lord the Dale family Lord you know all that they're going through and we just commit each one of them to you Lord is lift them up and Lord we're just so thankful Lord for all the all the blessings that you've given us Lord all the Miracles that we've seen and Lord sometimes we don't realize it but just to be in this building tonight's a miracle lord it's an overcoming and Lord we just thank you for that Lord because we know we can't do it in ourselves Lord but Lord through you are more than conquerors and we just thank you for that Lord we just look unto you tonight for all that we have have we commit all things in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Ephesians 4 and verse one and we're going to read through 13 it says I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called with all loneliness and meekness and with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace there is one body and one Spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore ye saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he Ascent ascended what is it but that he also de ascended first into lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all Heavens that he might feel all things and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come into the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and then we'll flip over to 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and we'll begin at verse 12 very familiar scripture and it says for as the for as the body is one and half many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have all been made to drink into that one into one spirit for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because I am not the hand am I not of the body is it not is it therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because I am not the eye I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole were hearing where were the smelling but but now God but now hath God set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him amen God bless you you may be seated tonight and just want to read verse 20 here says it says but now there are many members yet but one body and he says now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular and tonight I want to speak on being unified by the word and I love I love this scripture here where it talks about where Paul picks up in Ephesians and he begins to talk about what God done that he came to bring us through the spirit to bring us all into one body and he brings us all through all these all these things and we see that what he done he but he through all this of what he done because the work that he done on Calvary what he done to BR bring us in to fellowship with him to bring us into this body so by one Spirit we're all baptized into that body by his grace we were brought into that and because of what he done and brought us into that then it says it say he says that he gave some apostles of prophets and he said he gave evangelist pastors and teachers for the perfecting of that because we started on it we started God started on a path with us because he brought us in there but for us to come to our Perfection there's only one way that God has called people and that is through a five-fold Ministry because the scripture tells us that how he's going to how he's going to do this how he's going to bring us through and the only way that you're going to be unified how you're going to come to this place to perfecting of the Saints for us to be edified together to edify the body of Christ there's only one way to do that and that is through the word and the word puts a five-fold Ministry because God always works through a man he had his prophets that come to speak through the word through all down through history down Through the Ages we've all seen how God spoke to man and God had a man that he gave him the vision of what he wanted and that man began to speak and God brought that man through and he called him to do that job and no matter what come against him he always overcome because the word went forth and God had a vision of what was going to take place and it didn't matter how many de devils in Hell came against it it wasn't going to stop the plan of God and he always he always overcame and brothers and sisters we have we have received a message in our day we have received the word in our day we have received what God give us what came directly from the mind of God came in our day and spoke to us to bring us to a place because what God visioned in his mind you and I are the people that's been called to that vision and let me tell you if he if it was in the past when when Moses walked on the earth and there was no devils in hell that was going to stop them but they were going to bring forth and when when Joshua walked through through the land of promise him and Caleb walked through and saw the vision of what what God told Moses and he spoke to them and they walked through that and he came across and they told him said we're more than able to take the land because we've seen it because exactly what the prophet has said is just sayith the Lord and you know what I've seen it with my own eyes and you know what there's nobody's going to stop me because I have received a spirit that's inside of me that has quickened me that I know what my possession is and it didn't matter that Caleb had to wait 40 years to come into that place that he walked in because when he was old and gray and stoop shouldered and everything like that it didn't change who he was because when he come back in there later he told Joshua he said I'm just as capable to take this land as I was when I walked through it God called me to this place and nothing's going to stop me well let me tell you brothers and sisters the same promise waits for you and I because you and I have been called to this place that you know what there's somebody that's standing on the face of the Earth that has heard the end time message and that will take a body change that's what you and I have been called to God has called us well thank God that I have that I have rece received the understanding the Revelation to understand that God has called men in this last day that have given the been given the word to speak to us for us to come to the place that we all can become in in unity of the word that we can all come to the place where we all come to the unity of the faith the unity of the spirit that we all can walk worthy of the vocation that God has called us to because we have all been placed into this body and because because as the scripture says as Paul was speaking here because we're not we're not all of the same group and we're not all called to the same thing well you know what it doesn't make any big eyes or little use but we're all important we're all important in the plan of God no matter where you've been called to you've got a job to do and whatever God has called you to all God wants from you all God requires of you is to be faithful that's all God wants is us to be faithful to what God has called us to if we can just be called and just be faithful to the God's calling and we can just realize who we are and this is from the this is from the message hear ye him and brother Bram says he said that's what's the matter with the church today the reason that we don't have great manifestations he said the great Church of the Living God in this last day should be far down the road with every Divine Get Set set in order a great beautiful church but he said we've been broke up with denominations isms a little fusses and everything he said till God can do can do no more with us until we come together and get our hearts right with God he said that's why our blessings are about to run out he said it's it's getting cold and cooling off it's because we've been indifferent toward God towards God his spirit and his word and so we see that that because brother Bam could see the changing because of what had taken place here in here in the in the the mo moving of isua Street and he wait you know 50 years was supposed to be the Jubilee and he could see in 50 years from the day of the isua street Falling he could see all of the changes that had taken place when they should have been so much further down the road from where they were when the when the Holy Ghost felled and the gifts of the Spirit were placed in the church and all these things when they seen the opening of the word had taken place and when brother Bron began to preach the word to them then all of a sudden he could see that they had fallen away from where they had originally came from how many times he he stood there and told him he said he said your your parents and your grandparents he said they wouldn't they wouldn't stand for this and he said y'all went why just like just like a dog right back to its vomit a hog right back to its wallow he said God delivered you from that and you went right back into it and how terrible it was but God sent a message in our our day that that he brought us out of that that we can stand and see because you know it it's up to us to take this message and carry it on it's it's us to to live this life but you know what it's it's not it's not me and myself doing it but it's being yielded to the holy spirit because if I if I am a child of God then I'm DW then he is dwelling inside of me then you know what the only thing that stops the Holy Spirit from moving is Aaron Roberts I I'm the greatest hindrance that I have but you know what the greatest asset that I have is me because you know what when I hear the word I can act on it because you know what that's what God called me to do God called me to live the life he wants me to take it take it and and live it and operate it right yeah it's like well we're just going to wait on brother Wade to do it we're going to wait on brother Bob we're going to wait on somebody no it's you God wants you to do it God wants me to do it brother bandam says he said the he said in in the message conflict between God and Satan he said the real true bride would be United by the word and that's where I got that's where I got this title from he said the true bride must be unified by the word he says if she is a part of Christ she has to be the word of Christ in order to be the word of Christ you have to be baptized into Christ and when you're in Christ you believe Christ and Christ is the word he said the bride must be unified unified together by the word see he was speaking of of Esther you know because Esther had Esther had a commission of what she was called to do you know what there was death in the land but you know what there was nobody else that was going to do that was able because when Mori give her the the word there was nobody else that was going to be able to fulfill that except for Esther death laid at the door and the only person that had access to the king that would be able to do anything about it was Esther right but what did she do she didn't go in there by herself she went up there and she told all the Jews she said pray and fast pray and fast with me why because I'm getting ready to do something that I'm facing death she was the one that had to do that but you know what she had people that was unified with her to go before the king there was something that she was called to do and it was like well the Jews didn't say well you know what it ain't no none of my no they were all under that curse they all face death because of the king's decree but you know every one of them they got together with her and we were praying and and seeking God when she went in there see it takes everybody working together see he was speaking of the Bride Ador adorning herself just like Esther did see she had to get ready she had to prepare herself and the bride has to do the same thing he said what has she got speaking of the Bride he said what has she got he said assembling together in The Fellowship of the word amen Fellowship of the word fellowshipping sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he said tonight one Accord one place one Spirit one mind one hope one God one purpose amen see there you are every time the Bible says a anything we say Amen punctuating every word with amen see because they had to do just those Jews had the same had to get in the same channel that Esther got in because they had to get desperate that they realized what was going to take place and so she could walk in into that place into the into the king's chamber and all those people had been praying and fasting you know when it when it got to that point when it got real you know they wasn't always worried about what was going on in the news what the neighbors were doing what anybody else was doing why because it became important to them why because the the the seriousness of the of the time became became the most important thing to them when they realized where they were where they were at then all of a sudden they got they got to the place where they got serious with God and then they then they they began to pray well then Esther could go in on those prayers to be to be you know to to help you know because that that was that was a nerve-wracking thing that she had to do very nervous but see those prayers is what helped her go through that right she didn't go in there all by herself but she realized that the condition she was the one that could go in into the king's presence and and bring and bring that petition before them and brothers and sisters it's the same way with you and I sometimes sometimes we we think we think we're we're insignificant we miss we miss God's calling sometimes because we don't realize the position that we're in you know many many times brother brandham tell had told the story about about the sister and you know when the baby was was there and the and you know the the mother and you know she was standing there and and the Lord kept telling her to pray for that baby and you know she didn't want to do that because she thought she was insignificant to do that you know she began to question the calling of God and then when he when she saw that you know this this mother she's standing there she's got a prayer card like well I'm not going to pray for this baby cuz brother brandom's going to do it but you know what that burden laid on that mother because see that's what God told her to do and you know and then she then she tried to appease herself just by carrying the baby or letting the lady sit in her chair whatever but you know what God never got her away from that calling that was that was a desire that God had placed on her it was something that God had placed on her to do and you know what it didn't matter what she was like sister can I pray for your baby because I just can't I just just can't get away from this but what did Brother Brenham say when when he when when she came up into the prayer line with under discernment he's like that sister back there she prayed for the baby it's already healed and then when when he said that he said see see she was a mother she could enter in he said I might not been able to do that I'm not a mother but she was a mother she could do something but it also showed that that God was not a respector of persons because when when he had something to do there was something that he wanted that sister to do and so it was a it was a that's what God wants us to do he wants us to realize you know when God wants us to do then check it by the word but sometimes sometimes we're we're we're so in we think we're so insignificant to do something that God is trying to get us to do something it's like well you know it's somebody else's job you know and and if we if we spend all of our time dealing with how insignificant we are you know we never would get out of bed we never would do anything because all we could do is just living living a life of of our own insignificancy but thank God that God has called us to a place that you know what it's when we get to the place we realize that we are insignificant we are insufficient but God has made us to the place we are God has given us what what we have need of because if we've been birthed out of this old old life if we B out of this this flesh this old pest house and been born into the kingdom of God then guess what we're not God's not looking at your old flesh anymore but he's looking at you through the blood see if we can see who we are God wants us to see that you know because all all things that that you have need of he said it was given to you in the New Birth that if you had need of something that you've already you've already received it if you're if you're an heir of God and join heirs with Christ then if you if that's the position that you and I are in then praise God then we've got all the things that we have need of and it's at our it's readily at our disposal because if if if you if we're standing here today and we have and we have need if we're sick tonight then you know what he's already he's already took the stripes on his back and he's already completed it he said by his stripes we were healed so that that's a finished work then if you're standing if you're sitting here tonight then if you have a need in your body then guess what the healings already been completed it already lays there before you all you got to do is accept it all you got to do is claim it all you got to do is realize that tonight that he's a squatter the devil's a squatter on your property and all you got to do is cast him out right you don't have to stop you don't have to back up you don't have to apologize to the devil you don't have to apologize for who you are you know I was listening to a Jew one time and said well you know what it wasn't me that called me to be a Jew but you know because what God done for me that God done that I didn't have anything to do with it but I'm not going to back up I'm not going to apologize for who I am God's called us to be separate to be separate from the world to be to be completely or separate from the world I called out of the things of Darkness God has called us out of Darkness into this Marvelous Light well we don't have to apologize for what God's done for us we don't have to apologize for what God has showed us why because that we realize there's a special class of people that has been called to this it's not called to the whole wide world to see it but there's only a special group that's going to be able to see this see God has called us into this God God has a plan a purpose he has he has a way that he wants everything done you know we find a place in the scripture when we see a group in the in the Old Testament that came together and you know they had their own way of of coming together and and they wanted to have great things and and have great things take place and you know they all came together and they had their um the the all of the things together what what they wanted the purpose and all the things that they want wanted to have together and they got this great idea that they want to go out and build the Tower of Babel you know because everybody because the wickedness in the land had got so great and they all wanted to build a great tower to to their uh ideas and and their thoughts and how great they are and you know this is their great Monument to what their what their their achievements are in this world and everything we realized that that God allowed all this thing to take place and then he destroyed it and he uh separated all the different languages and everything like that and split all the people up why because when everybody came together and tried to do what God then God tore it all down and he separated it and he busted it all up and here's here's brother bandam speaking he says he said you see that as they they they traveled they come into this this Fair land he said and they United themselves as one people he said now that's all right but he said but they United under the wrong leaders ship he said they had United under the leadership of man he said and God wants man to unite under the leadership of himself he said he wants us to be one but he wants us to be one with uh but he wants to be one with us but man wants to wants his fellow man to be his leader and unite under the wisdom of his fellow man and he continues on see he said see how striking it is he said he said that's that's the reason that that he wants to be is because that God designed him for that purpose God designed man to be to unite together God designed man made him up to be one to work together to cooperate together he said that's the makeup of man that's the way God made him but man always wants to have his idea about it he said he wants to project something that God never intended him to do he wants to figure his own ways out he wants to make his own plans he said but he won't accept the plan that God made for him because it's his Fallen nature see God called a man and he's got a he's got a purpose and he's got a plan that he wants man to come through but you know everybody they get their own ideas on how things are and as they did when they tried to build the Tower of Babel they had this great plan of what was going to take place and what they could achieve and all these things that was going to take place and how great they are but the problem problem is it never amounted to anything but you know we see everybody there's so many people that have tried to come up with their own ideas and their own thoughts or how they were going to work things out and how things were going to come and you know they want to be so great but when God begins to speak to them and tell them exactly what it needs what you've got to do to come to the place to be great if you want to if you want to be like him if you want to be like Jesus Christ then what you've got to do many times people come to the place and realize it's too great of a sacrifice face because there was a you know the Rich Young Ruler that he came and had this great plan he come and recognize who Jesus was and he told him he said you know what Master what must I do to inherit eternal life see he realized he was insignificant what but when Jesus began to talk to him and Jesus loved him because he saw what kind of life that he that he lived what he's like you know I've done all these things since my youth look of all the all the things that I've done in my life I've kept the law all the things that I've been taught all these time but see when Jesus began to discern his life and come to the place and realize you know there's one thing that's holding you back there's one thing that's hindering you from coming to the place that you need to come to and he said it's your riches he said you need to get rid of everything sell everything give it all away just get rid of it why because it's such a hindrance to you and your life is holding you back from the place that you want to come to when Jesus standing there the word of life is standing there the son of man standing face to face with him began to speak to him and tell him exactly what he had need of what he needed to do and it was too great for him it was too much for him to give that up and he walked away sad sorrowful he had all that he had had need of and didn't realize the greatest thing was standing in front of him oh I've got great barns I got to tear down and build bigger I've got so much when he's sitting out there one day thinking you know what I can just take it easy now look at all the look at all the wealth I've accumulated I've got all this Prestige oh look at all the things that I have in this world and not realize he sold his own soul for bigger barns for wealth for a good name all the things that he sold his he sold out for but when it come to a time that he had to give an account for his life none of it mattered none of it was never accounted to anything brother Ram says here in in the Queen of Sheba see he's talking about the the people in in their lives and and the things that they go through he says what a disappointment it's going to be at the at the day is going to be at judgment he said when men who sought that they were all right because they had Faith to heal the sick because they had they had Faith to operate a gift they had great meetings great evangelist service and one Souls but see all the things that they had done and he says depart from me you workers of iniquity I've never I never knew you when they come through all these great things and done these great things and said Lord look what we've done all the great things that we've done and brother BR say see it takes more than power of gifts it takes more than just joining church he said it takes the birth of the Holy Spirit to break down our walls and to unite us together as one great Christian body moving for one objective and one goal see we have to be move beyond all these things see that's what God's purpose is for us for us to come together see you've got you've got to lay down all all of your your thoughts and ideas you've got to lay down everything and say Lord what do you have me look in the scripture to find out what God wants from you he said see that's that's the God's purpose we find here in sining the Holy Ghost was one purpose that God himself might dwell in his church and continue his plans through the church that God was in Christ continuing his plans through Christ out of Christ into the church continuing his work through the church so he continues his work through the church so what God had his in his mind he it's come to us to do that thing to to the plan of God for us to come understand what the purpose of God is for our lives and you know to see what God wants us to do you know to to and not see as as anything insignificant but if God's called us to this then you know what what is not insignificant what God has called us to you know what what God has laid before us see God has equipped us to the do these to what God wants us to do and you know if if we work to because we have to work together because you have to do your part and I do my part and it and it's all of us working together but but you know there's one thing that the one thing that you're going to find out and I know we all we all know it but you know anytime you you get in your mind that you're going to do something for God and God's called you to do something there there ain't no day that doesn't pass by that you know that the devil's not there to hinder everything that you try to do when you when you get when you get something God lays something on your heart and you just think you know I know this is the will of God for me and you just feel like this you're led to do something and there everything that comes against you and there's nothing that goes right and you think well why in the world is is that the way it is you know why is it that you know I was thinking about the message you know brother R preached the message recognizing your day and its message and you know brother Randon was talking about he kept trying to he felt like the Lord was trying to tell him something he kept trying to trying to get the mind of God and he said I kept trying to pray and he said you know he said I ate something that made me sick and he said I kept falling asleep and he said you know I kept driving and he said I kept trying to every time I kept trying to yield myself and trying to get to find out what the Lord was trying to tell me you know it was just like everything was just coming against him it just like you know but you know brother Bram never gave up on that every time that the thing kept going on he you know he just kept going and kept going he said you know he just kept yielding himself he just kept praying and he kept seeking God trying to get the and he said you know it was early in the morning you know he finally the Lord broke through you know come through and began to speak to him and tell him he said you know I just got this message to bring to you this morning so you know it's it whatever God has for you you you're going to find out the devil's going to hinder you he's going to try to hinder you and everything well praise God you know if if you realize it's the will of God for you to do something then you know when you just keep pressing on and don't give up you just keep pressing forward because you know if you because the devil's going to hinder you in every way shape form and fashion but praise God we've been given this contest because a contest is is a test of strength brother R said and say you got see the greatest contest there is but is between the church and Satan see you got to realize that he's coming he's he's a brother said he's the great strength the great strength of Satan but he said you know there's a great strength in the church too see we realize that see God has called us to this God has called us see the devil's going to try to hinder you but praise God that when when God try when the Satan's trying to hinder you God is still there and guess what you just got to keep pressing in you just got to keep pressing forward because if you keep fighting this battle then you're going to see that he's going to break through that God has something for you you know just like Daniel there waiting on 21 days praying you know because when when he you know the Lord tried to speak to him but you know he prayed and he was searching and looking for an answer but you know what God sent him an answer God had an answer for him but you know what he just kept waiting and waiting and waiting he didn't know when he was going to come but you know what God didn't give up on Daniel God already had his answer coming to Daniel but you know what you know but he said you know that Michael had to come and help him but you know Gabriel come and spoke to Daniel he said he said you know great you're greatly beloved of of God that that he wanted to talk to you and he had an answer for you Daniel and you know you know he thought about you coming and seeking God for an answer for these things that you saw in the word well you know what if you have an if you have a question in the word then he said that he would brother Ram said that he's obligated to put somebody behind the pull pit to give you an answer then you know what then if you've got if you've got an answer don't give up on on your questions you know I've had questions in my life that it takes years and years and years to get an answer there's things that that are not that are not clear you don't you just hold on to them and it's like well I don't understand this and I don't understand that but you know one of these days if you but if you never if you never get into the word just like Daniel you know he was he said he was studying by books and was reading what the prophets had to say reading Jeremiah and the different ones he when he began to read those things he began to see these things he began to pray about it and people you know they talk about well they don't they don't know uh I well I don't understand certain things it's like well have you ever read it you know you find you find people you know brother de and brother Wade they they definitely know you know you hear these people and they and you know they don't know the first thing about Daniel 70 weeks but some of them don't even own the Daniel 70 weeks book when you don't even own the book and you've never read it you've never listened to the tapes how in the word do you expect to ever understand anything if you've never got into the word you know if you don't if you don't ever begin to study these things and and read then all of a sudden you know people well you know I I've never I've never read that well how are you ever going to get anything it's like you know people expect how you know you go to school you know you they send you to school every day for 12 13 years whatever it is you never crack a book you never carry a pencil you never you never do anything and you wonder why you don't learn anything well you know if you just go and sit in the classroom and stare at the ceiling all day long you're not ever going to get anything well if you come to church and you're and you're so uninterested in what's going on that you're looking at the back of your eyelids you know and if and if if you're not interested that you ever go back and listen to what's being said when when when when when the brothers give us a tell you like brother Wade was saying you know uh what y'all to do now we're getting ready to get into the church ages youall to read the church age book well if nobody ever looks at the church age book if you never listen if you don't even listen to brother Brandon preach the church ages if you don't ever listen to any of it you never read the book you never listen when they when they you know you can actually hear the church age book written somebody actually read the book and you can actually listen to the tapes of it you don't even have to read read the book you can just listen to audio of it but if we never take the time to even look in the book if we never take the time to do that or when when brother Bob has told us listen go back and read this chapter you know if you never go back even skim the chapter if you never listen to the chapter well if you've never taken the time because you don't have the the desire that how do you expect to grow that how do you expect for anything to take Place well sometimes if things happen you know when they when they they they'll tell us things well you know what if if we if we take them and actually apply them in our life then things will happen you'll actually see because sometimes is that just brother Bob speaking or is that just brother Louise saying something or is that actually God speaking to us wanting us to take heed to what's being said then then if we can actually do that why because sometimes I just tell you the fact straight up sometimes I'm the one saying Lord I'm sorry because you know what they'll tell me something because I hear Brother Bob say something like that and then later on it's like you know what I didn't look at that and I you know I I apologize Lord I forgot sorry but Lord bring it back to my Rememberance because you know I you know I I I'm human I make mistakes I fail but you know what I I don't want to be like that I want to continue on see God has called us he he wants us to do these things see the Holy Spirit we yield ourselves of the Holy Spirit and let the Holy Spirit do a work in US brother BR said he said and in the message what is the Holy Ghost given for he's speaking of the Holy Ghost he said see it's it's to give unction to the preacher he said it's to give Holiness to the group it's to set the church in order he said it's to bring Unity of spirit it's to unite us together with power it's to unite us together with love brotherly love he said he said there's nothing present nothing Future No no hunger starvation nothing that can separate us from the love of God he said the love of Christ the love of God that's in Christ because we are born of his Spirit washed in his blood we are a new creature that's what God came to do that's what the holy spirit's for so that's what God has called us to do he's called us to this that that God wants us to take these things because it's going to give us power but you know what you're not going to have power you're not going to be able to overcome by yourself it takes it takes a it takes a body effort because I want you to understand it is a body Ministry it's a body Ministry and you know what you're important and I'm important but you know what you can't you can't put yourself above me and I can't put myself above you but you know what I've got to put myself into a place to understand that I'm here to help you and you're here to help me because we've got we're here to edify one another God didn't God God didn't call us just to be in one spot and and just you know be an island to unto ourselves so you've got to you've got to work together see I want I want to speak on this before I close T night and this this was something I was going I was going to preach on in in Honduras and I only got to cover just a little bit of it but I I want I want to cover this tonight you know brother Brandon was speaking one time and he said I was in a football stadium and he said I was staying there and he said a sign said it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog and he said that's right he said see it's it's what it's you've got to have a fight about you he said you got to get into it he said that's what you've got to do and he said you know he said he said anything that I hate to see as a spineless person call themselves a Christian he said God calls anybody he said they got gret and backbone he said he said as buddy robins and used to say Lord give me a backbone the size of a Sol hog but plenty of knowledge in the gamble end of my soul and let me fight the devil as long as I got one tooth and then gum him till I die see you've got you've got to come to that place he said see that's what God wants us to do he said that's what God wants us to do tonight God's always willing to give us he said if we're ready to receive it he said that's right God made the promise so it's ours the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that's a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call so the promise is here that's what God has done for us see God has called us that he wants us to come to this place we got to have the grit and backbone we got to realize who we are and we've got to understand the fight is on and you can't give up God has called you to this fight and you got to realize that you know what you've got to do your part you got to fight you got to fight and be brave against all evil you can't give up now brother brandham continues on here and he was speaking of of of football and you know he he talks about he said you know he said the problem is is you got to realize that you got to work together it's all it's all a body Ministry and he said you know he said the problem is is people he said everybody wants to pack the ball and everybody wants to fight and he said the problem is they're fighting a man that's trying to carry the ball he said he said no wonder we don't get anywhere he said everybody's wanting to pack the ball he said when a correct football game is going on they'll pass the ball to their best man he said all together we are in this great F fight of life he he said we ought to be we ought to stand behind our pastor stand behind our Brethren with all that we got within us say we got to all SP and we got to all do what what God has called us he said see what do you think the holy spirit says in the presence of God he said there is not no division in the Church of the Living God see when you realize who you are you've got to get to the place that God's called you to and do the part that you've got to do the brother Bram continues on here he said when when they run the he talks about he talks about there's two positions that he that he really talks about he said you know he said the one of the problems he said the thing is we want to do is not take the ball out of the man that's got the ball that's running it we don't want to take the ball away from him now he continues on there and he talks about there's two positions that we ought to have that he talks about in football the first one he talks about is is being a tackle when I played football I played tackle I know that surprised some of you but I played tackle I know what tackles do but you know you know when you when you play tackle and brother B also talked about playing a guard when you play tackle the one the first thing you got to do you don't look at what everybody else is doing the first thing a tackle's got to do is he's got to line up and see who he's supposed to be blocking he's got to know what the defense is trying to do because the defense is to hinder you you got to know what everybody you got to see where everybody's lining up the first thing you got to do is realize that when they line up on the other side of the ball what they're going to try to do is try to deceive you they're going to try to come in there and they'll bring people down and you think they're going to rush when they're not because as soon as they come down they'll run back they'll drop back in coverage I know some of y'all May don't understand that but some of you will Google it but what what happens is the first thing you got to do you got to know who your man is the first time I played in ninth grade first time I ever played in a football game in my life organized football I blocked the wrong man they sacked our quarterback you know what I was I was nervous I was I was you know I was all excited I was jittery but you know what after after I had screwed up and I went back in the Huddle you know the first thing they didn't do what are you doing you know what they just lined back up hey we gonna get them this time they didn't they didn't chew me out they encouraged me you know why because the guys that some of the guys on the football team they' been playing a long time I hadn't but you know what they got in there you know what it's like listen and then you I had somebody tell me one time it's like do you know you're supposed to block yeah I think I know who I'm supposed to block but you know what it takes time why because everybody but you've got to know what your position is you know I didn't look at what the quarterback's doing I don't look about what anybody else is doing I got to know where I'm at on the field I got to know what my job is and I got to recognize what's going on for my position because if I spent all my time if they got ready to snap the ball and I'm looking at somebody else and trying to figure out what everybody else is doing I'm no good I'm not I'm not effective I'm not doing anything so many times she was like well what do you think about this what do you think about that everybody's got their eye on everybody else it's like well let me ask you a question before you start asking what everybody else is thinking and doing and everything he's like have you prayed about it you know they used to sing this song many years ago and it was like uh you know if you see me doing something wrong it says then you go and tell Jesus on Me That Man From Galilee said don't tell another not a sister or a brother but go and tell Jesus on me you know if you see me something doing something wrong the first thing youall do is go tell Jesus about it well you know what oh did you see that well you know what if you do that on the football field you know what you're not effective then what are what what are the tackles to do they're on the end of then you're looking for somebody that's coming you got a block and you got to know how to block and your guards the next two men the on the other inside of the line on the other sides of the tackles are your guards that's exactly what they they've got to do brother Bram said we got to use our influence as tackles we've got to block we've got to support those that are running he said because the tackles that protect the runners he said we should be tackles he said be a guard guard the ball he said the holy spirit is trying to pack it see he said it'll condemn sin it'll condemn unrighteousness he said it'll manifest and glorify Jesus Christ he said it'll bring his person into the midst of the people see if you can if you can be the position that you need to be you guard those people well how well how do we protect each other by prayer when you pray and you're here in church when you're in fellowship with your brothers and sisters because you know what you gather strength from one another then he said that's the reason he said forsake not the assembling of yourselves together then we pray for one another because you know you've got to pray and I've got to pray for you to strengthen each other see he said guard guard your man guard protect the ball see that's what God wants us to do see guard them those that have that are going to run the wall he said he said see keep the rest of them so they can run keep guarding them and he said we'll have a touchdown after a while and Jesus will come and then it will all be over see God has called us to do these things how do you how do you protect one thing is Hebrews 13:7 1 says obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls that's what God wants us to do if you want if you want to be effective in the plan of God then know what your what your position is to submit yourselves obey what God has for us to do and then he says Hebrews 121 says wherefore sin we are so passed about with so greater cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight in the Sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us see we're all called to do these things God's given us a job but I want you to know one thing God wants us to be guards tackles but you know what you have a time you've got to run the ball we've all got to run the ball in your life your daily life as you go through life just like brother B talking about a young man a man going to work with a lunch P under his arm that's Jesus Christ to the world a woman doing her wash washing clothes going about her daily duties see that's where God's going to say you've got to carry the word you've got to be the light to the world see there's times where you can't carry the ball we're protecting the others but you know we're supposed to protect you when you carry the gospel you know it's not brother R said I'd rather you live me a sermon than preach me one see it's not just about preaching it but it's all of us coming together brother Bram says here in the angel of the Covenant he said we all have to work together as one unit he said we have to get our differences away and lay aside doctrines and things and put our arms together and press forward and take the promise that almighty God has given us he says he says Unity is not an isolated thing Brethren Unity is for the whole body of Christ you know there's so many times that people have have taken things and you know and things have happened and instead of and instead of trying to draw people in you know brother brother they told Brother Brandon's like well you know what're going to draw you outside our Circle and brother BR said well that's all right you can draw me out I'm going to draw my circle bigger and draw you back in you know what brother BR just because brother brandham disagreed with people you know what it didn't stop him from loving people it didn't stop brother Brandon from calling him their brother right he didn't compromise on the word with people but you know what he showed them the love of God and sometimes people you know they don't want they don't want to have anything to do with anybody but you know there's no way to show the love of God that way I was listening to somebody the other day and he's a he's a a denominational preacher and you know you know he was standing up and he was and he was talking about the that there there's so much stuff that goes on in the world today and you know there there all these celebrities and and different things like that well you know he just stands up and tells them listen this is what I believe and I believe that's wrong but you know he's not he's not against people but he's going but he wanted the world to know that the world is is full and he's like people you know just like the the Methodist Church and and different ones everybody wants to come up with their uh a a better understanding of the scripture and he stood up and said well you know what you can try to come up with a better understanding of the script rure but he said he said but two men living together and two women living together he said that's incompatible with the scripture he said you'll never he said you'll never bring that together he said he said there's no place in the scripture where that'll that stands but he said listen he said you know you people are trying to come up with you know trying to understand and love people if you want to love people you show them what the word says that's all that's the love of God it's the word of God and you know what and people are not going to accept it they didn't accept it in Jesus's day and if they don't accept it well you can't help that but you can still love them and show them what's trueu and you know they were he was talking about some some man had went to went to some he said he was speaking for the black church and know this man's was a black Minister and and he and he told him he said listen he said you don't speak for me he thought he said well you know there's so many people in the in the in the black church that that live that lifestyle and he's like listen he they were apologizing for the way they've been treated he said you don't speak for me and I I thought I thought it was really good because he began to speak but you know what he's he he wants people to see what the truth is and the only way that you're going to show the love of God is through the word you know what you can't compromise on the word because you know what if if you just if you just let people just go and do whatever they want to do then you know then you're doing a disservice to them because if you don't answer because if you've been called of God to give an answer to the people to explain them what the scripture says then on the day of judgment you'll answer for that but you got to tell tell the people what the truth is to let them know listen this is what God's called us to this is what truth is you know because God God wants us to know what the scripture says and you know God called us to this message and when he called when he called us to this truth people well you know brother Brandon was wrong here brother Brandon was wrong there but you know there's a lot of things that people don't you know when you began to look you tell me what brother brandham brought out of the scripture that was wrong let's let's look into the scripture and let's start bringing things out of out of the scripture that brother brandham said when you begin to start to look at in the things that came out of the scripture tell me tell me where when he preached the future home you tell me where what what he brought out of the scripture that was something that nobody understood nobody El saw those things tell me tell me where brother Brandon was wrong when he preached the 70 weeks of Daniel you show you show me when he started to preach the seals the things that he brought out you show me the things that's not in the scripture no they want to take things that that you know well how many people fell off the bridge and and this or that no show me where where he didn't preach the word you know what there was three things that he said that the scripture talks about there's three things you man's got to watch out for for money women and popularity you show me where brother brandham failed on that you show me where brother brandham didn't stand up and live the life that that when when the men that stood around him they disagreed with brother Brandon but they stood up and they and they began to preach and said we saw Jesus Christ walk in our day then all of a sudden when when brother banham's gone then they're like oh well you know we we we we want to argue about things I told myself I I don't I don't under I don't I don't put a lot of stock in a lot of that because you know I had a friend of mine when I was in school his name was Jimmy and and Jimmy wasn't that big he was kind of a small and he slim guy but he always liked to get around me when he when he wanted to like he wanted to show off to people just in a comical way but you know he' always come up to me and you know he'd always pull his my arm up in front of him like this and he he'd hold his arm my arm on his chest and he would stand in front of people and say you better be glad he's holding me back and he always stick his chest out while he had he had my arm in front of his chest and he'd stand there like well you know I told him I said that's exactly the way I see these people that want to condemn brother brandom they want to tear down this message I said that's exactly the same way they are that's the same that's the the same Ridiculousness that I see am but you know what God has called me and if nobody else believes it I'll believe it I'll take the way with the Lord's despised [Applause] few but you know what God's called us to this place and I thank God for him bringing me here and I I I I feel a closeness here I I feel I feel a Unity here and I I don't want anything to to happen to that I just want us to draw closer to him and if we draw closer to him we'll draw closer to one another because it's the hour is late and we don't know how much longer we got but I want to be faithful with what he's called me to God bless you let's have the musicians stand let's all stand the musicians come let's sing that little song If we can we'll give the glory to Jesus and tell of his love and tell of his love we give the glory to Jes Jesus and tell of his wonderful love will give the glory to
