[0:06] God bless you Saints good to be in the
[0:08] house of the Lord this morning let's go
[0:09] to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so
[0:12] grateful to be able to gather around
[0:13] your word I pray guide us today Lord
[0:15] Jesus bless the service Lord help us
[0:17] Lord to gain more understanding and more
[0:19] strength and more power Lord we ask Lord
[0:21] that you'll bless today Lord in your
[0:23] name amen so we're on 1 Corinthians
[0:27] 6 and 1 Corinthians six
[0:31] um starts off like this dare any of you
[0:36] having a matter against another go to
[0:38] law before the
[0:39] unjust um yeah I uh
[0:44] oh there we go thank you
[0:47] brothers that's a little bit
[0:49] better dare any of you having a matter
[0:52] against another go to law before the
[0:55] unjust and not before the Saints do you
[0:58] not know that the Saints shall judge the
[1:00] world and if the world shall be judged
[1:03] by you are you unworthy to judge the
[1:05] smallest matters know you not that we
[1:08] shall judge Angels how much more things
[1:09] that pertain to this
[1:12] life isn't that interesting that he's
[1:14] calling out that you you have the
[1:16] ability a saint a born again Christian
[1:18] should have the ability to judge things
[1:21] of life and uh you know sometimes we get
[1:24] caught up in the in uh maybe we look at
[1:27] scriptures the wrong way and we think
[1:28] well we're not supposed to judge well
[1:31] there are things we're not supposed to
[1:32] judge and there are things we are
[1:33] supposed to judge and look in this case
[1:36] Paul's saying you're you're supposed to
[1:38] have the ability to be able to judge
[1:41] situations and to be able to judge right
[1:44] from wrong and look at something and say
[1:45] whether it's correct or not uh e even
[1:48] even to the smallest thing somebody
[1:50] somebody says they did work for somebody
[1:52] else and they didn't get paid or
[1:53] whatever and then um he said why are you
[1:55] taking somebody to court to be judged by
[1:59] uh a
[2:00] a heathen somebody that's not born again
[2:03] when you should in the church have
[2:06] somebody that you can uh go to to
[2:09] reconcile uh these kind of
[2:13] situations so if we really examine the
[2:15] kind of judgments if kind of look at
[2:17] judgment for a second there's two kind
[2:19] of judgments there's that Judgment of
[2:21] you I I I've got this little table of
[2:25] I'm not going to go through this table
[2:26] too in depth but there's really two time
[2:28] kind of judgments the a judgment of a
[2:30] motive and then there's a judgment of
[2:34] fruits it's really hard to tell what
[2:36] somebody's real motive is it's like a
[2:38] Iceberg floating in the water you know
[2:40] there's part of the iceberg under the
[2:42] water and part of the iceberg above the
[2:44] water you it's real hard to tell what
[2:47] somebody's real motives and intents are
[2:50] under the water but you certainly can
[2:54] look at the fruit and tell whether the
[2:56] fruit is right or wrong and what what
[3:00] the fruit is fruit's usually like like
[3:02] at work where when we're when we're
[3:03] giving reviews or whatever they say you
[3:05] got to be specific and the fruit fruit
[3:08] is usually pretty specific like like
[3:10] this morning before we come to church we
[3:11] had a we had an
[3:13] onion that we found out was
[3:16] rotten and and you can be pretty
[3:18] specific that it it needs to be thrown
[3:21] out there's something wrong with that I
[3:22] don't want to eat that and so like for
[3:25] example if somebody tells a lie and they
[3:27] get caught in a lie then you can be
[3:29] pretty specific that that's not right if
[3:32] somebody is unjust about their payment
[3:34] to somebody they they they hire somebody
[3:36] to do some work and then they don't pay
[3:39] well that's pretty you can be specific
[3:40] about that so now you you you'd have to
[3:44] be uh you absolutely can judge the fruit
[3:50] to say whether the fruit is right now
[3:52] that might or might or might not speak
[3:54] to somebody what's under the iceberg
[3:56] what what's under the water it might U
[3:59] but it certainly speaks to what the
[4:00] fruit is now so so we look at all these
[4:02] different types of judgment there's
[4:04] hypocritical judgment where Jesus said
[4:07] in Matthew seven Jud be careful how you
[4:10] judge judge not that you be not judged
[4:12] for what me judgment you judge you shall
[4:14] be judged and with what measure you meet
[4:16] it shall be measured to you again so if
[4:18] if you're looking at somebody and you're
[4:19] judging them for the same thing that
[4:21] you're actually doing now and that
[4:23] that's the human nature we don't
[4:25] realize sometimes so often the things
[4:28] that we are doing so he's caution hold
[4:31] on before you start throwing out that
[4:32] judgment and point that finger you know
[4:35] what we say so many times that when you
[4:36] point your finger there's there's
[4:38] actually three pointing back at
[4:40] you so be careful when you point the
[4:43] finger that you're actually judging with
[4:45] righteous judgment there's also the
[4:47] personal preference and opinion judgment
[4:49] in Romans 14 why why does thou judge thy
[4:52] Brethren why does thou set it not thy
[4:54] brother so in other words we got to be
[4:56] careful that we don't judge somebody
[4:58] just because of a personal conviction
[4:59] ition or or in in the case of the
[5:02] Corinthians dietary choices or special
[5:05] days or Traditions that don't really
[5:07] have any direct bearing on salvation or
[5:09] clear biblical commands like a good
[5:13] example is that every every every
[5:15] December it comes up again that we start
[5:17] throwing out the Judgment because
[5:19] somebody gives gifts to their kids or
[5:22] somebody you know they have a Christmas
[5:23] tree or they put up some lights or
[5:25] whatever all of a sudden then uh people
[5:28] are preaching I've heard sermons about
[5:30] well these people are actually
[5:31] worshiping the devil cuz they got and
[5:33] and it's like that come on now you got
[5:36] to be careful that you don't get into
[5:38] the wrong territory judging just because
[5:40] of a personal conviction or something
[5:42] that doesn't really have any bearing to
[5:44] somebody's salvation in other words
[5:46] throwing somebody on the bus when they
[5:47] that you know condemning or final
[5:50] judgment speak not evil one of another
[5:53] brotherr he that speaketh evil of his
[5:56] brother and judgeth his brother now this
[5:58] is this is that that that Judgment of
[6:00] looking under the
[6:01] iceberg and saying I I I my you ain't
[6:06] even born again you ain't even this or
[6:08] putting that label on
[6:10] somebody judgeth his brother speaketh
[6:13] evil of the law and judgeth the law how
[6:16] how do you speak evil of the law if you
[6:17] judge somebody like that because the
[6:19] Leviticus 19 says Thou shalt not avenge
[6:21] nor bear any grudge against the children
[6:24] of thy people but Thou shalt love thy
[6:27] neighbor as thyself
[6:30] ain't that interesting that that's an
[6:31] Old Testament statement that's an Old
[6:34] Testament commandment we placed that in
[6:36] the New Testament but that's Old
[6:37] Testament to love thy neighbor as
[6:39] thyself to not bear any grudge against
[6:42] the children of thy
[6:43] people speak not evil one of another
[6:46] Brethren he that speaketh evil of his
[6:48] brother and judgeth his brother speaketh
[6:50] evil of the law that's looking under the
[6:53] iceberg I think one of the most
[6:55] dangerous things that comes into the
[6:57] church is is is when we kind of get in
[7:00] our mind that we have a special gift of
[7:02] discernment to be able to look under the
[7:04] iceberg I find I found just in my own
[7:07] life looking back at different people
[7:09] sometimes uh I'm throwing this out there
[7:12] sometimes the people that are so
[7:14] convinced that they have a special gift
[7:15] of discernment have maybe the most
[7:17] problems because they're they're they
[7:19] have the inability to actually look in
[7:21] the mirror at their own self they're
[7:22] more concerned with saying that they can
[7:24] discern the other person now if you do
[7:27] have a gift of discernment that's that's
[7:29] wonderful but it will be a help to the
[7:31] church it will not be something to Lord
[7:32] over somebody or to hold up and say well
[7:34] bless God I'm I I got you under my thumb
[7:37] and right I I remember years ago I've
[7:40] come across different people I've come
[7:41] you sit you sit there and they they're
[7:43] like I I I've got a gift to discernment
[7:46] and they they hold they want to hold it
[7:48] over your head and and place you in a
[7:50] place where where they are the one in
[7:52] control and meanwhile their whole life
[7:54] is many times a train wreck amen so if
[7:58] you've got if you've got a gift of
[8:00] discernment look in the mirror of God's
[8:01] word and make sure that your life is
[8:03] correct you you you look at brother
[8:05] brandom's life that that his he had a
[8:07] true gift of discernment but his life he
[8:11] was really living the gospel laying down
[8:13] his life uh like Paul's uh yielding
[8:18] himself and putting himself into a place
[8:20] where he he he uh his life was totally
[8:24] spotless now that's where we that's
[8:26] where the place that we want to be if
[8:28] we're going to put oursel into a place
[8:30] where we can look under the iceberg look
[8:33] under the water examine oursel first
[8:36] amen now what look at what brother R
[8:38] saying it this Corinthian Church really
[8:40] was a mess they're in such a mess where
[8:43] the people in that church are maybe
[8:44] looking around saying I don't have
[8:46] anybody that I have confidence in to
[8:48] judge things fairly if if I place my my
[8:51] situation in front of this person then
[8:53] they're they're going to be biased
[8:54] toward their family if I place my
[8:56] situation in front of this person
[8:57] they're not going to be able to look at
[8:58] look at things correctly that nobody has
[9:01] wisdom and and so Paul's saying look if
[9:04] you don't have any confidence anybody
[9:06] you ought to be able to just find like
[9:08] the least person the least in the the
[9:10] least in your church and just go to them
[9:13] there should be somebody that's got the
[9:15] holy ghost that you can go to that's got
[9:17] a fair impartial like a a gift of wisdom
[9:21] to be able to judge things rightly he's
[9:24] saying even a young Corinthian believer
[9:27] should know how to judge biblically
[9:30] dis distinguishing clearly between
[9:33] judging the heart and motives which is
[9:36] God's job
[9:37] alone or judging the actions and the
[9:40] fruit which is a believer's
[9:43] responsibility amen a Believer any
[9:46] believer should be able to uh you you
[9:49] know you you you look at your children
[9:51] coming in from work or or staying out
[9:53] late at night and you should be able to
[9:55] say well that ain't right you look at or
[9:59] a young person that's that's seeking a
[10:01] spouse should be able to look at
[10:02] somebody that's that uh uh seems like a
[10:05] a good candidate for to spend the rest
[10:07] of your life with and say and judge
[10:10] whether that person really is what they
[10:13] say they are if they got all these
[10:14] Facebook photos and things of them going
[10:16] to the beach and wearing shorts and and
[10:18] and bathing suits and stuff then you
[10:20] should be able to judge and say well
[10:22] that does not look correct that doesn't
[10:25] because of the fruit because of the
[10:27] actions because of the works it it looks
[10:30] like there's something misplaced in that
[10:32] person's
[10:33] life so Paul said in verse four he said
[10:36] if then if then ye have judgments of
[10:38] things pertaining to this life set them
[10:41] to judge who are least esteemed in the
[10:43] church I speak to your shame now when we
[10:46] read First Corinthians we can read it
[10:48] like like we're going to school but
[10:50] let's read it like we're actually there
[10:52] and and you'll notice as Paul Paul Paul
[10:55] says a lot of things that are sarcastic
[10:57] he'll he'll take their statements of the
[10:58] Corinth is he'll throw them back and
[11:00] we'll see in a moment he'll take he'll
[11:01] take their statements that they make and
[11:03] he'll throw them back in their face and
[11:06] and and he'll he'll say things in a way
[11:07] that to to bring shame to them like in
[11:10] other words you you say you're born
[11:12] again but hold on now have you really
[11:14] living it I speak to your shame is it so
[11:18] that there is not a wise man among you
[11:20] in your whole church is there not
[11:22] somebody that you can go to with your
[11:23] problems and that you have confidence in
[11:26] to to to lay things at their feet and
[11:27] say well look ch choose what's right
[11:31] know not one that shall be able to judge
[11:33] between his brother but brother goeth
[11:35] the law with brother and that before the
[11:38] unbelievers and verse 7even now
[11:40] therefore there is utterly a fault among
[11:42] you because you go to law one with
[11:43] another why do you not rather take wrong
[11:47] why do ye not rather suffer yourselves
[11:50] to be
[11:51] defrauded now there's a good question
[11:53] for a Believer isn't it would wouldn't
[11:55] it be
[11:56] better in light of your Christian
[11:58] testimony to Bear a little bit of
[12:01] personal
[12:02] Injustice to to just to just put up with
[12:04] one another sometimes rather than
[12:08] tarnish the reputation of Christ rather
[12:11] to drag all of your problems and things
[12:14] out in front of a court and and then
[12:16] have everybody in the in the Gentile
[12:18] world and the Heathen World question
[12:20] whether what you say is really true and
[12:23] dragging your testimony through the mud
[12:25] wouldn't it be better just to Bear some
[12:28] faults bear some wrongs nay you do wrong
[12:32] and defraud and that your brother now
[12:35] now look you can see how I tied verse 8
[12:37] with verse 11 that's where sometimes it
[12:40] helps to read things from the context
[12:42] just think about the context and verse 8
[12:45] he saying you do wrong and defraud and
[12:47] that your brother and then he's well
[12:49] well let's read the whole thing he said
[12:50] know ye not that the
[12:52] unrighteous unrighteous meaning
[12:54] defrauding robbing one another not
[12:56] treating one another right the fruits
[12:59] the unrighteous shall not inherit the
[13:01] kingdom of God be not deceived neither
[13:03] fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers
[13:06] nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves
[13:08] with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous
[13:11] nor drunkers nor revilers nor
[13:12] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[13:14] of God and such were some of you now now
[13:18] this is where he's throwing it back in
[13:19] their face in in a
[13:21] sarcasm such were some of you in other
[13:25] words you claim to be you claim to be
[13:27] changed but you are washed you're
[13:30] Sanctified but you are justified in the
[13:32] name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit
[13:33] of God what he's saying is so act like
[13:35] it you're sitting here defrauding one
[13:38] another and and doing things wrong I I
[13:41] don't mean I'm not preaching at y'all I
[13:43] feel like
[13:47] I'm it's okay
[13:51] y'all Paul's talking to the Corinthians
[13:54] here if you behave like the world you
[13:57] don't belong to the kingdom of heaven is
[14:00] what he's saying if you don't belong if
[14:02] you don't if you behave like the world
[14:04] you don't belong to the kingdom of
[14:05] heaven now now look you can see how
[14:07] these this evidence of the new birth
[14:09] kind of go is is there's something under
[14:11] the iceberg but there's something above
[14:13] the iceberg above the water something
[14:16] below the water something above the
[14:17] water of the iceberg there's your faith
[14:20] that God can see your motives the
[14:22] underlying you know where you where when
[14:24] you're home and you're praying and
[14:25] you're thinking about things what you
[14:27] really want to to see done you're Direct
[14:29] in life but then there's the fruits that
[14:31] are manifested so Paul's saying now look
[14:34] I'm looking at you and I'm judging you
[14:36] by the outward expression of your life
[14:39] and you're sitting here robbing one
[14:41] another and taking one another to court
[14:42] and not having confidence in in
[14:44] anybody's wisdom in church and not
[14:46] having confidence in in your church
[14:48] really a a and and I'm looking at this
[14:51] situation like uh if you don't if you
[14:53] ain't acting like the world something's
[14:55] something's wrong if you're acting like
[14:57] the world something's wrong
[14:59] in verse 12 he says now this's this is
[15:02] where he's taking a statement that the
[15:03] Corinthians make all things are lawful
[15:07] unto me because they believe they could
[15:09] just get away with anything because they
[15:11] got Grace and now he's throwing it back
[15:13] in their face you say you say all things
[15:16] are lawful unto me but he's like but but
[15:19] all things are not
[15:20] expedient in other words there there's a
[15:22] lot of things that because of Grace that
[15:24] I can do you know there I can I can uh
[15:28] you know I can
[15:29] uh but all things are not expedient all
[15:32] things are lawful unto me for me but I
[15:33] will not be brought under the power of
[15:36] any now I got down there at the bottom
[15:38] right the all the things on social media
[15:41] there's there's some good things that
[15:42] you can get off of social media we'll
[15:44] use that as an example you can learn
[15:47] about power tools and you can learn
[15:49] about what something that'll help you on
[15:50] your job and you can learn about cooking
[15:53] and all those kind of things but he say
[15:55] all all I can I can do anything but I
[15:57] will not be brought under the power so
[16:00] when you start being brought under the
[16:02] power of it and now you're a servant to
[16:05] it and you're just sitting there Doom
[16:08] scrolling scrolling through it all day
[16:10] every day and you've you're it's it's
[16:13] now has a power over you where you're
[16:14] not praying and you you're you're
[16:17] getting away from what God is calling
[16:19] you to do and now you're a slave to it
[16:23] so the Corinthians were probably saying
[16:25] since we are under grace and not under
[16:26] the law we can do whatever we want we're
[16:28] free in Christ Christ now look at verse
[16:30] 13 Meats for the belly this is another
[16:32] statement of the Corinthians that he's
[16:34] throwing back in their face Meats for
[16:36] the belly and belly for the meats and
[16:38] the belly for Meats in other words
[16:39] they've had this idea that if you've got
[16:41] an appetite any kind of an
[16:44] appetite whether to eat or the
[16:50] other it read between the
[16:52] lines that then you should feel it and
[16:55] you think that was the Corinthians but
[16:57] I've come across people in life you know
[16:58] where they they're raising their kids
[17:00] that way well you're not born again so
[17:02] if you got an appetite you might as well
[17:04] go out there in the world and feel it
[17:06] and fulfill it you you might as well
[17:08] take advantage of the opportun this is
[17:10] this is the way that this is the way
[17:12] that some people with a with a carnal
[17:14] unregenerate mind will think about
[17:16] things and why we need the new birth
[17:18] because if you're looking at things like
[17:21] well if you're not born again yet if you
[17:23] haven't come to conversion you might as
[17:24] well you might as well satisfy the app
[17:27] the carnal appetite that you're you're
[17:29] raising your children wrong you're
[17:32] raising your children like a like a
[17:34] carnal
[17:35] Corinthian amen this is what Paul's
[17:38] trying to straighten out he's saying but
[17:40] God shall destroy both it it and them if
[17:43] you got a good plate of grits in front
[17:45] of you one day that those grits are
[17:47] going to be go away right but think
[17:49] about the
[17:50] Eternal if you're uh and we get he's
[17:53] getting into this that if there's a a
[17:56] harlot one day that will be destroyed
[17:59] but think about the Eternal God shall
[18:02] destroy both it and them now the body is
[18:05] not for fornication but for the Lord and
[18:07] the Lord for the
[18:09] body so they believe that if there's an
[18:12] appetite you might as well feel it I
[18:14] remember years ago brother D preaching
[18:15] on Temperance and how even Temperance
[18:19] even applies to when you you're in that
[18:21] Buffet line and you just can't
[18:23] control that's something to think about
[18:25] in So that's what he's he's striking
[18:29] back at that the inability to
[18:32] control
[18:34] anything it if you got a anyway well
[18:38] y'all get the
[18:40] point Meats for the belly and the belly
[18:43] for Meats but God shall destroy both it
[18:46] and them now the body is not for
[18:48] fornication but for the Lord and the
[18:50] Lord for the
[18:52] body now you start thinking about what
[18:54] the body really is
[18:57] for the body is is not just and then I'm
[19:00] just going to read some some of my notes
[19:02] here that I got here on the left that uh
[19:04] in in verse 13 Paul saying your body is
[19:07] for the Lord not for sexual immorality
[19:10] and verse 14 says and God hath both
[19:12] raised up the Lord and will also raise
[19:13] up Us by his own power in other words
[19:15] he's saying here's some proof for you
[19:18] that God has raised Christ bodily and
[19:21] he's going to raise us as well so your
[19:26] your body isn't just some disposable
[19:28] shell that's going to be pushed over to
[19:30] the side that your body actually is
[19:31] something that's actually tied to your
[19:33] Eternal destination that when we're in
[19:35] glory I'm going to look like this and
[19:37] you're going to look like that you're
[19:38] going to look like how you did in the
[19:40] prime of your life and it's not just
[19:43] something to to to to just cast aside
[19:46] and that we're going to cast or just to
[19:47] use any old way but it it's our bodies
[19:51] serve as part of our Eternal Destiny
[19:53] being transformed at the resurrection
[19:56] into a glorified Immortal body so that
[19:59] we can dwell forever and the presence of
[20:01] God as part of his perfect and United
[20:03] body so our bodies are a means for us to
[20:07] honor God and serve his purposes now you
[20:11] think about so in verse 15 and 16 he
[20:13] says know ye not that your bodies are
[20:15] the members of Christ shall I then take
[20:18] the members of Christ and make them the
[20:19] members of an Harlot God forbid what
[20:22] know you not that he which is joined to
[20:23] in Harlot is one body for tooth saith he
[20:26] shall be one flesh which is from Genesis
[20:29] where he says therefore shall a man take
[20:31] leave his father and his mother and
[20:33] shall cleave unto his wife and they
[20:36] shall be one flesh now you think about
[20:39] that when you when you have a marriage
[20:41] there's two people that are separate
[20:43] that are coming together to join their
[20:45] lives together so that they are one in
[20:48] everything now now get your mind away
[20:50] from the carnal Gutter and and let's
[20:52] think about the the Oneness of of of of
[20:55] a married couple that's living life
[20:56] together when God created woman and from
[20:58] man's side it was to form a Unity that
[21:02] husband and wife would become one flesh
[21:04] so the wife is not merely an independent
[21:07] partner instead she is seen as part of
[21:10] her husband's body which means a deep
[21:14] intimate Union when where both are
[21:16] sharing the same purpose the Same Heart
[21:21] the same mind the same actions and the
[21:25] same spiritual lives now that's
[21:28] transcends all the carnality that
[21:30] normally where we go to when a wife
[21:32] takes her husband's name and both
[21:34] fulfill their roles according to God's
[21:36] word she becomes intrinsically connected
[21:39] with him her life her character and even
[21:44] her inheritance are bound together with
[21:48] his you you know you think now I look
[21:51] back at all my years of of being married
[21:53] to my wife and and uh we're we're so uh
[22:00] you know what this when I have a
[22:02] heartache she's got a heartache when i'
[22:04] when she's got trouble I've got trouble
[22:06] and now that's that's getting into
[22:07] Oneness when I when I'm going through a
[22:10] a like just a little a little spout of
[22:13] dness then she'll make some ice cream
[22:15] you
[22:16] know you know and we're we're bound up
[22:19] together and and I look you know I look
[22:22] in the we we've got our our checking
[22:25] account and our savings account and
[22:27] we're bound up together so much that
[22:28] that that's hers and you know you know
[22:31] you think as you as you grow older you
[22:33] know what if something were to happen to
[22:35] me and the Bible actually says that if
[22:37] you don't leave an inheritance then
[22:39] you're an Infidel if you don't leave
[22:40] something to take care of your family
[22:43] and so that's part part of our our
[22:45] Oneness is is is that I'm you know
[22:48] anything that I would leave behind the
[22:50] house the the little bit of the wind
[22:53] blowing through the bank account
[22:55] whatever whatever whatever's left what
[22:58] whatever I can scr up to leave for her
[23:00] because it's all parted together now the
[23:02] same thing in Christ you're so one a
[23:05] Believer is one with him to the point
[23:07] where whatever he has left for you
[23:10] whatever he your inheritance all these
[23:13] promises lay here are the whatever he's
[23:16] given whatever God has given to Christ
[23:18] he's also given to you because you're so
[23:22] you're so bound up together until you're
[23:24] one you can't separate so in other words
[23:27] now to think about that if if we really
[23:29] get it that that when you're going
[23:31] through a low point then then God he's
[23:34] touched by the feelings of our
[23:36] infirmities right when we're going
[23:38] through a a rough spot then then God he
[23:41] cares about it he he cares and he he's
[23:45] he's uh he he wants he wants the best
[23:49] for us which is his word and so you're
[23:52] so intrinsically connected with him just
[23:55] like my wife and I are intrinsically
[23:57] connected and your your spouse house are
[23:58] so intrinsically connected that our our
[24:01] lives and our character and everything
[24:04] are bound up together now now that that
[24:07] frames what Paul's trying to say to to
[24:10] take that to take all that and then join
[24:13] it with a harlot or join it with
[24:15] something that ain't right now now what
[24:19] we're getting to is is over in
[24:22] Revelation that the the true church the
[24:25] Revelation says is joined to that Harlot
[24:28] because through that balum Doctrine
[24:30] we're we're about about at time so I'm
[24:32] going to be drawing up here in just a
[24:34] minute but he
[24:36] said and and does God ever change mind
[24:38] his mind about his word now see what
[24:41] happens if you if you if you if you take
[24:43] the real Christian church and join it to
[24:47] a harlot idea like Roman Catholicism or
[24:50] something some false teaching then it
[24:52] begins to defile the Christian
[24:56] identity if a person in Christ were to
[24:58] unite with someone living an unrepented
[25:01] sin like a harlot the Christian identity
[25:04] would be
[25:05] defiled just look at it in the fields
[25:07] today he said as balum married into
[25:10] God's Church a harlot married the Harlot
[25:13] into God's church so is these false
[25:15] teachers today trying to tell you
[25:18] they're going to marry every one of
[25:19] these organizations and these people in
[25:21] the old Harlot of Revelation 17 their
[25:24] balum Doctrine going around today and
[25:26] say we're just the same were all
[25:29] Christians and Priests and popes and
[25:32] whatever more all compromising and doing
[25:35] this so you can see a Hara is a woman
[25:37] who's been unfaithful to her husband
[25:40] somebody that's unfaithful to to join
[25:42] yourself to that defiles your
[25:45] identity in verse 15 he says you know
[25:48] you not that your bodies are the members
[25:50] of Christ shall I then take the members
[25:51] of Christ to make them the members of in
[25:53] Harlot God forbid what know ye not that
[25:55] he which is joined to an Harlot is one
[25:57] body for two saith he shall be one flesh
[26:00] but he that is joined unto the Lord is
[26:04] one
[26:06] spirit and there's many scriptures that
[26:09] we can list out that show that when
[26:11] you're joined to Christ you're one with
[26:14] him John 17 that they all may be one as
[26:17] thou father art in me John 15 abide in
[26:20] me and I in you you're part of the vine
[26:23] you're you're the branches but he's the
[26:25] vine and Romans 88:9 but ye are not in
[26:27] the flesh but in the spirit so
[26:30] Christians are spiritually re United
[26:33] with Christ and this should govern their
[26:36] actions worldly
[26:38] indulgences especially sexual sin
[26:41] contradict that Union because the body
[26:43] belongs to God not personal pleasure
[26:46] true Christian freedom is about honoring
[26:49] that spiritual Unity rather than
[26:51] misusing Liberty for self-gratification
[26:56] so in verse 18 we'll close on this he
[26:59] said flee
[27:01] fornication uh and we could say
[27:03] fornication like in Revelation 17 and
[27:06] fornication natural flee it all every
[27:09] sin that a man doeth is without the body
[27:12] but he that committeth fornication sinth
[27:14] against his own body it it's not like
[27:17] you're just robbing somebody or doing
[27:19] something stealing a stapler at work or
[27:21] whatever you actually hurting your own
[27:24] self what know you not that your body is
[27:26] the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in
[27:28] you which you have of God and ye are not
[27:30] your
[27:31] own for ye are bought with a price
[27:35] therefore glorify God in your body and
[27:39] in your spirit which are
[27:42] gods and we made it to First Corinthians
[27:44] 7 so we'll stop there God bless you the
[27:47] musicians can go ahead and come forward
[27:50] [Applause]
