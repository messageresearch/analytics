truly we do thank you you for all things because you've given unto us everything that we would have need of that's right we have the material things Lord of life that we can right Rejoice over and be healthy and all as much as we can in the natural but especially to you to reveal your word unto us amen this is a wonderful age wonderful time Lord that would it would be that you would wind it all up by giving us your word in its fullness and we thank you for it and we not looking forward to things as much as we're trying to be able to see what's taking place right now because we want to realize realization in an hour We're living forgive our sins and just touch each one remember little heavy Grace there and that that vomiting and things Lord and just clean out that school room or the school and everything there Lord we apply the blood of Jesus Christ to that position the word that it'll come out and those demons or sicknesses will have to leave the little children that's right we love you and we thank you bless each and everyone here now this day and open our understanding that we may be able to walk in you forgive our sins because we want to be complete have your way in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 and then Revelations 19 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John by record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that is saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for what for the time is at hand right Revelations 19 we'll jump to verse 11 and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that set upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he that judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and notice already on his head now we'll try to get to that in a little bit because when it comes to this place the Saints is crowned him right all right now so remember that he had many crowns any name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God and the enemies which were in heaven excuse me and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed and fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should Smite the Nations and he should rule them with a rod of iron and he threat the wine price with the fierceness of the wrath of almighty God and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and Lord of lords you may be seated the Lord has his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been trying to get down and you know to a point and like I said we covered over to through the Book of Revelations and spent a lot of time talking about the things that will happen in all like that to the world and the situations of life and tribulation period and and all all kind of things but now we're coming over in more into the Glorious part to be able to talk we've got a couple of spots in here like the white Throne judgment but you know really the white Throne judgment is not a horrible thing if you think of it in the correct order and we'll get to that to try to bring it you say well that's a judgment that's true but there will be people there at that judgment if they've been correct and done right you know they'll be given eternal life right right so it's not you know a horrible thing to think of it's horrible in the fact of what we do and don't do on a lot of it but that's you know we'll get to that but we're over into the Glorious part of the Book of Revelations now to be able to understand and see our time where we are right now that's what I'm trying to get us to see but then where we're going and what will be in the future right all right see we we know that the bride goes up in Revelations 4:1 and she's not seen again in in there on Earth until you come back into Revelations 19 when you're riding back into the millennial Reign all right now I didn't say it wasn't seen in heaven cuz that's Revelations 5 the prophet said she's not seen on Earth through there see and that's that's correct because it'll it'll tie together but we were trying to cover our Sunday and I want to make sure sure that you you follow me you know in the first part of the 19th Chapter there but but verse 7 and it says for the marriage of the Lamb is come all right and his bride ha made herself ready now I hope you followed what I was trying to bring out Sunday about that because we're not going over there to get ready right the getting ready has got to be here right this is the place where they're getting ready there won't be no extra uh place there that we can earn things out or do whatever you want to call it that's right we're we're uh we got to get it right here amen because when you come to this scripture see it doesn't say the bride will make herself ready or the wife it says the wife ha right all right and then it says also that the marriage of the Lamb is come all right well see then we know that we're not at this position yet right all right right but then we were covering that the prophet said in chapter 18 where it says come out of her my people that then when you get over to chapter 19 it says after these things all right after what after the coming out amen the coming out is the getting ready that was the main thing I wanted you to see Sunday the coming out of the systems of getting away from organized religion and our thoughts and ideas and and all like that and anything contrary to the word is the main thing that we want to see because that's taking place now right it won't be that when we get up there right because that's what people thinks see we've always you know if you're there in organized religion very much you'd hear them say you know I'm not doing too good now but but when I get there when I get there Glory well that's good that's wonderful but I thought that the way the tree leans is the way it's going to fall right I thought whatever we are here that we will be that gu I didn't know this was going to be a a situation that we can have a court of appeal you know that when this is over with we can WIP out some of the things and problems I thought my understanding was that the bride doesn't go to the white Throne judgment we'll get to but there is a judgment of the Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad that the bride will have to face all right and see then that way we're going to have to face each other with it right that'll be the main thing it you know is we'll be judging each other right and that won't be a judgment of a decision of eternal life no because you already have it when you get to that place but it'll be be Judgment of the Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad now that was see I like to keep things in an order and that way I can use scriptures to to tie it together and and then I if I cross my scriptures up as I was saying about the coming of the Lord our Sunday see the coming of the Lord is many things in the scripture right and and you take a scripture that applies to the bride and put it to Israel look where you messed up you take one to Israel put it to the bride look where you messed up amen that's right cuz you see all of that is his coming all right and see then that way you can keep it together and certain scriptures apply to certain things then it can have compound meanings to word that it can apply to bride and you know Israel right but there's got to be a separation because once you bring the scripture together and you can see the bride of Christ she's his wife y right but Israel will never be his wife right she rejected that right right you know CU that won't that won't be connected but I I tried to say something Sunday and and you know maybe one of these days I'll get enough understanding myself to be able to preach on it but you know I've always thought about it as I say in Sunday there afternoon see we say that the Old Testament was Jehovah's bride the New Testament is Jesus's bride see if you ain't careful you got two two things right right right that are taking place Y and see then you can see how that the Jehovah the old is the Jesus of the new right right well you can see how those Old Testament Saints some of them came into the New Testament right right dispensation by the new birth but those that didn't some of those that will be chosen will actually be in the Millennium and things like that but they'll never be brought back as a form of a wife right right amen there will be servants and you know the 144,000 and they'll be you know breing and things we can call them all those things and we won't look down on them right amen it's like a said about the servants it's not the servants that they're going to be yes my Lord yes my Lord no see you're getting too much in your mind of thinking about one of these days is going to be something no they'll they'll be there and they'll have their job right they'll be servants for the bride but not running around doing your work for you right you know and you sitting back somewhere sipping on a Coke you know cuz I don't think none of that's going to be there right all right but I'm just you know just trying to get a point for us to see something that see that way then you can take those some of those Old Testament Saints bring them right into the New Testament and there's only then one bride right that's righten right yep now whether you like it or what you lump it that's right only those that were the chosen of Israel right was able to come into the New Testament dispensation right and that would have been Jehovah's bride yep had there not been a new testament y That's right right absolutely I tried to say that Sunday I know that if you get that tangled up just call me I'll try to express it to you maybe I can explain it to myself some of these days but see I just don't see all of this that ties up you got too many wives running around you got too many thoughts too many problems that's right see if they had not been a new testament group of people to come in then that would have been all Israel wouldn't have been the Bride of Jehovah right come on right he wasn't married to all of that junk it's like he's not married to all the Gentiles right right right yep it's the chosen amen see then that way I've got one wife to worry about you know that I can see how they come right on over into where we are and we go over here and then we all go up together one of these days right we don't have to worry about it then we go to the Millennium and they'll be there but they rejected the right of sunship some of them did right and they'll get to come up but some of them come over into our dispensation yep Peter Paul right James John amen the day of Pentecost was was Jewish sure as a matter of fact the prophet I think I put it almost to work that even the first church age was basically Jewish we said well maybe just a few Gentiles brought in but then when they come into the New Testament dispensation they were Gentiles right cuz that's what he come to get was a gentile bride all right now but see she's made herself ready we've got to get ready here right or there won't be anything there to be able to worry about so we brought it out like the prophet was covering off of of the message God's keeps his word in he says the garments are paid for they're ready but but you must be ready to wear those garments see I know it's hard for people to to realize and follow it to the correct way I know what the scripture says that salvations of the Lord that's Jonah 2:9 I'm pretty sure and we didn't do anything to get saved we just accepted Jesus Christ as our savior now he knew we would accept that so he knew what all of the rest would be but now after you're born again you know after you're born again you do have something to do with your salvation yes sir all right that's what I'm talking about the Deeds Done in the body we'll get back to that when we get to Revelation you know the the the white Throne judgment and then the Judgment of the Deeds we'll cover a lot of that and use what the prophet is saying but you see church then we must put on the garment they're provided right but we must put on the Garment you remember the prophet even in God's provided way was talking about the little girl that you remember the armor meat packing man come out looking for a wife and the things and the little girl saved all of her money yep she had a lot to do with it yep amen you remember Ruth she had a time that she was laboring yep but when she was sent home with those six measures of barley the seals and the things in other words that's right when she was sent home with that she was resting all right so that's what's happened in our day we've had the seals delivered unto us amen we're coming into a rest yes that's that's the rest day will be the Millennium amen all right that will be the rest day that will be the the real Sabbath right amen I've got it in here somewhere that be the real one but are we ready to put the garments on right well you you sound like you're making salvation some kind of works I thought Works was supposed to be our faith expressed right amen that was what I thought it was to me amen all right see then in doing that brother random talks about that little girl saving all of her money but we fail to look where he says and the money that he sent her right amen see he sends us gifts amen he sends us Ministries he sends us people to help us amen right all right he sends those to them that's what he says there in the scriptures they he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangels some pastors some teachers for the perfecting the bringing of the Bride into completion all right see we're not in the days of just being good and going to church come on right we're in the days that these bodies are going to have to be changed amen amen all right the prophet I gave it to you on the marriage of the Lamb where he said 1962 where he said if God put you in a pipe and pushed you through the other side there would be no overcoming for you that's right and you go check every Church age it says to the Overcomer right all right now he gives us the ability to overcome yes amen does that he does those things giving us that ability but the prophet said on on the marriage of the Lamb he said that she had to lay aside all of these things you know you remember he was referring to Esther right why was Esther chosen yep you remember who was it Mor that his name right you remember he kind of knew a little secret sure did he couldn't knew what the king liked that's it you know it amen so he dressed her according to what the king liked amen the rest of them pued theirselves up real flusty Dusty you know or whatever you call it flusty dsy and got all pred up but y he put Esther the way she was supposed to be right amen and when that King looked out there amen he saw her dress the way he wanted her he saw her living the way he wanted her and that's what the bride of Christ all right trying to review just to H now to get us to going brother said on the message PR uh pardon preaching 63 he said Jesus is waiting on his church to get ready the his bride has made herself ready we got the potentials the holy spirit is here see to get ready we got everything we need we got the message of the hour all right didn't we going on over to where we were in birth pain we brother around and said what kind of a garment did she have on to make herself ready his own word word now he's given us the word in the in timey to be able to come to that place right that we can be ready a baby is born to baby now trying to illustrate salvation but you know if that b don't eat right it's not going to live right amen all right see then we do have something to do with our Salvation after we're born again right because we can choose to go up the statue of a perfect man or choose to be blly just hoop BL and forget it Y and that's what I see a lot of the people of the message doing now that years ago they used to be so on fire right so built up and so gear it up but now it's just y well I'll go to church when I want to yeah I got the tapes I can watch it on the internet I can do what I want to Y but do you right do you come on very easy to snooze in the lounge chair home man at least here you got somebody around you might holler wake you up but now remember see she's got to put on that garment yep which is the revealed word amen and I was trying to illustrate it on the form of getting ready for this message tonight that see we talk about that when we're already married to Christ that's true I hope you listen to Sunday afternoon message y wouldn't hear do you say well but brother Dale we got the quotes we're already married amen but what about where we're going to the wedding Amen in the sky how about in the same message of invisible Union where brother R is talking about looking like that we're already in sin we're already married and then in a minute he says we're going to the wedding in the sky y but see there's not but one wedding right right amen all right right but it's in stages right amen it's just what it's developing and that what I was trying to get to point across on this our Sunday to to be able to get to the place cuz brother brandom covers it and he says on the second coming of the Lord said we're not only engaged but we're married right amen the church is married to Christ we are the wife of Christ bringing forth children right well amen that's true right cuz once you receive the new birth you're married to Christ amen by the new birth that's but there's a lot more of this part out here that's involved that's right all right this what I was trying to get across Sunday afternoon CU brother around and said why we're against or why I'm against organized religion says after these things after these things after this right come out of hurt after after these things is the shout of the bride with the bridegroom going listen to The Marriage of the Lamb going to the marriage of the Lamb see we're going to get married one day but we're already married when you're engaged you're married right right Y is that the way it starts we get on a marriage and divorce we finish up this when you ask a girl to marriage you and she accepts you're married right right amen but you're not married because that don't give you a right to go live together y that don't make that the legal legal part of it right all right so there's a lot going to a wed so the prophet can say we're already married and we are by the new birth but that's only in your soul that's your father strong strong right amen right see we're going to the marriage of the Lamb it doesn't say going to the marriage of the father right that's what we're that's what's going on now right amen and see then that word that we're received in I gave you the quotes our Sunday that we're uniting with him the word while we're here that's a wedding that's a part of a wedding is uniting with him right I thought we believed at least here in Lula to to say it that that we believe that the bride is going to be the son of man according to the way the prophet said right right correct now brother d That's only brother random w s all right you you just ain't read enough right amen the bride is going to be the fullness of the godhead bleen that's that's right like we were talking yesterday brother Mark brother Donnie and brother Chris and we sitting there talking I told him I said there's a whole lot goes with what we're doing right am am a lot of things go with it you know you say well I I brother I've got the quote right here that we're married to Christ what are you trying to say that I'm going to a marriage in the sky no I'm trying to tell you the prophet says we are right okay yeah right the same one you want to quote he says we're going to a wedding in the sky he said we're going to the wedding of the Lamb he says on the book paragraph 5 359 of The Sixth Seal talking about on The Sixth Seal and he says the bride is done gone forth the Queen's done went to take her place she's being married now to the king while this was going on see that's what I'm saying the people want some onesided idea or a thought now I'm sorry I'm just say what I believe and leave it alone that's as organizational as anything else is amen and for me to take a one-sided View and won't receive the other right if the people would take it that way it would correct a lot of things right see brother rown says while that the Ser listen this is questions and ansers back in 57 and while the ceremony is going on in heaven of the Bride the Gentile bride being married to the prince while they're being married there's three and 1/2 years taking place on Earth with Moses and Elijah right see years ago this came up and I just kind of bypassed it and let it go but I knew I'd come back to it eventually because I believe I believe by the new birth that we are the Bride of Jesus Christ amen that's right but it says our Revelation is why has made her sever day right so there's a lot of difference between to say a bride and a wife y because it signifies a wife as maturity right when me and Peggy first got married you know everything was yours yours yours I don't have anything yours that's yours I thought and understood that everything I had was yours and everything you had was mine right you know I don't like what the fell said one time he said everything I have is mine and everything my wife has is mine now that gets over kind of a little on the yeah wrong side but see since she finally got out of that now she says mine why because she's grown up you know she's become a wife she realizes that hey no matter what she's a part of me amen and she owns just as much as I do and that way see then you can get it all together and like I was you know I've tried to bring it out Sunday then what are we doing we're married to Christ the word right here we have a new birth amen and this bride in the end time is coming to a place that no bride down Through the Ages has had to come you remember there's a bride in each age now it's all one bride right come on it ain't brides and brides and brides and brides and Brides you know it's one bride right in each age made manifest right all right now in this age we are responsible for bringing them out of the ground that's went on ahead of us amen right all right and to do that we must become the word amen amen his wife has made herself ready right that's got to be right here right I believe that or we don't go there that's right that's right when we go there and 19 says that verse 7 says his wife has made herself ready the marriage of the Lamb has come y right see doesn't as I said I kept saying it Sunday it doesn't say the marriage of the father right that's what people can't understand they can't take the things brother R will be dealing with us talking with them yesterday about we are his Offspring right is that scripture right y we are his wife is that scripture right we are his bride is that scripture we're his children is that scripture come on is that right right are we all of them things but you know one thing that we are that we got to know in this day we are him made manifest right there amen not just a why right see there's where you putting the wife she's over here husband's over here right children's over here fathers over here see you're making two different things out of it you can't come out to the fullness of the godhead B being in the bride by making him one person and you another one that's right we are him made manifest amen right 1969 in Athens Georg of the first sermon I preached that the Bride of Jesus Christ was the son of man that's what she had to be in this end time right amen don't you think I feel wonderful about it that that has never been taken away but it keeps adding too amen the Bride of Jesus Christ has got to be him right right we become so much as one until he doesn't divide between us right now you notice where I said that he don't divide amen right he don't look over you another person yeah he said but that's getting too close I wish we could get it closer right right like I told the brother about it you know the Catholic believe the pope is God sure they just don't believe they that's it right there that's the problem it's like I told that man I talking to up Je Ville Indiana that day and he was a deity person believe brother Rand was God I said I believe in deity brother right I said take away all R R's gifts and the signs cuz that's that's not to dealing with right but as a human being I'll go along with you that that was deity standing there if you'll accept this brother standing here that has the baptism of the Holy Ghost is deity right he says oh no oh M well see I don't need talking to him anymore no cuz he's done settled see he's got his idea the Pope says he's God see he just don't have any children right right the pope ain't supposed to have any that's right it might have been a lot of them that did but they're not supposed to have that's according to their book but see God's Not only got children brother R said God would become visible among us but he says he doesn't come your Corporal no that's right we meet him in the iron but said he become visable Among Us raise the dead and we go into Rapture he well how much more visible can it be if the bride will ever get down to the basis of saying I'm him made manifest amen that's right that's just too much brother D no no no that's the truth of the word right I believe that but we don't want to believe it that way no we want to leave it as some kind of a he's over there we're over here that's right yeah right you say well well brother D will that make us the god of Heaven that'll make us to God that he wanted us to be right wouldn't it that when Paul got up on Mark Hill and they just had all these little places you know and they had all these Gods then they had one little place left and they just made a little cubicle something and they said to the unknown God right just in case they forgot one of them right we know what Paul said he said that's the one I want to talk to you that's right amen he said and now even your poets say man y we are his offspring Y come on but do we believe it Church come on do we believe that we are the children of God right amen well that's hard to be is it it's hard to be the children of God and the wife of God at the same time but that's what he says right my wife calls me Daddy not because I'm her father the kids call me poppy most of you around here call me poppy not because I'm your physical right you know Daddy or whatever see it's in the gospel right that's right see now she's not only my wife mother she's a part of me right yeah yep but see we we don't want to do it that way but we'd rather lean over to the other side and say well well I just make be in a way now in a way that might be right brother said there's no such thing as in a way you either one or the other right we are either Jesus Christ made manifest or we are the Antichrist made manifest one or the other I believe that amen that's right did you see church we are going to the wedding in the sky right we all talk about that yep right but you see then everybody wants to try to prove some kind of a point they say well over in Israel they have the the marriage supper before the wedding you know but what does that make right what does that change your Prophet was speaking in English terminologies human terminologies of our day and he'd say we're going to the wedding in the sky amen even said one time he said if I don't see you anymore I'll see at the marriage of the land I'll see at the wedding supper yeah but see the marriage of the Lamb is when that son of man we've got to be married to him because we're going to have faries like his right amen but you know what he is the father right Amen brother Brandon was chapter 5 of revelation will have him sitting on the throne and while you have him over here getting up walking around coming over here taking the book getting up on the throne and sitting down y that's right it's just simple acts of a play right right amen it's just simple ways of what he's doing he come to pay the price for our Salvation Amen to release his life to make us his children and to make us joint erors right is that scripture now that's right Revelations 8 I mean Romans 8 right that were joint a right ARS of God and join ours with Jesus Christ amen amen is that scripture right but you see church what do we are what do we do what are we see where his wife amen where his children where his offspring where his bride right we're his beloved amen there's many many terms of it yep it's only one church church that's right but see this end time people has to come to a place to realize that now that doesn't mean that them down through there in the ages gone by are not the bride of Christ right they're the they're the bride there is Offspring there is wife y but they would come to maturity to be fully called a wife right amen this is end time to do that we were talking and our son was asking Sunday about it said when we get there will they be lower than us I said no Luther and them will be just the same as we are when we get there but they're going to realize how come they got there right they're going to want to talk to you about it y because now if Luther if brother's right whatever we are here we are over here then Luther right was a trinit while he was here yep that's just the outside man but that Inside Man of that new birth was never a trinity come on I want to see that somewhere right y if you can show me in the prophet's message that wasn't a trinity no that new birth inside of him was a new birth just like everybody's new birth that's right amen making him an offspring just like it makes you an offspring so I'm not teaching an end time as to coming out to be a super duper special wife no but that's what we are amen because they're waiting on you and I to come that place yep to unite them together see when we get to the wedding supper we're going to get married before we have the wedding supper we're going to be married to Christ the word because the Bible says we'll have bodies like unto what amen his own glorious body amen all right there's going to be a wedding in the sky amen for the Bride of Jesus Christ but you see like I said while ago you take the second coming of Christ and you try to apply it wrong with his coming and you got the Jews and you got the bride you got this and see here you take the prophet's message of this about we're already married one group will go this way y the other group says we're going to get married y well I to be both of them the day you get the new birth you got married that day that's right that's right when we go to heaven in glory whatever you want to call that there's going to be a wedding in the sky remember we only deal with three and A2 Years A lot of times but we know for a certainty before we come back in the Millennium that that's right there got to be a 7-year period yep that's right we know that from Daniel 70 weeks amen that's where people don't want to listen to that part of it that's right that's what a man asked me and said where are we going after we get there I said I didn't answer him I went home I sat down I said the man asked a serious question Lord right what are we going to do he said just check out the prophet run a few things in brother said we're going to the father's house he said just like when Isaac and Rebecca got married they went straight to the father's house see we're going to have a beautiful time amen what kind of wedding is that going to be I ain't worried about it I'm not concerned about it that's right but I am concerned with one thing getting ready that's right and then everything else will take care of it all right now when we get to heaven let's jump over into going now a little we're going to the wedding the prophet said in the sky paragraph 277 invisible Union pull that up brother Joe in the SE Brother Anderson I just want you to read it but I want you to realize in the same message I'll be glad to show it to you he look like he's talking and he is we're already married y but look what he said here hallelujah now notice you're not only that but you're going to the wedding in the sky and you're weing the wedding band of predestinated unmar Grace a wedding band of Grace unmerited of your own what to a wedding in the sky and then there'll be a great marriage supper I gave you a quote our Sunday We R around and said they ask him was was the uh marriage supper where was it that he said the marriage supper comes before the Millennium right yes abs and see that's where it has to fit in you put everything in order and you don't have to back off of nothing amen see you don't have to change nothing in the Book of Revelation you got 19 and that's riding back into the Millennium and then you got like 20 covers the white Throne cuz see that's after the Millennium there's nothing out of order in the Book of Revelation all perfect right everything got to be put in order but now watch where are we going then and I want to leave some of this about the Millennium to be able just to take one thought with the Millennium point but I want your thoughts to be on this look what number two it says where are we going now we're going to the wedding supper and look at the message that's in yep it's in the future home right and look what he says help us Lord if there is one here that's called to the wedding supper of the Lamb this thousand years of Millennium rain and then and to then enter into the city after the honeymoon is over yep the Millennium is merely the honeymoon then she the bride takes his bridegroom takes his bride yep home see there's more after we get to with the Millennium amen it's hers her bridegroom his bride oh he's going to prepare a house since he's become engaged amen now if brother R I'm just honest now watch I know that don't mean a thing to you but if he hadn't said that like that look where you'd be y if he said we were already married just a BL but he didn't choose that he say engaged cuz see the Bride of Jesus Christ will be there amen those that was in each one of those ages coming down yep if you're engaged you're married [Music] right right all right so then look why he would choose I mean sometime I sat down and I weeped of the terminologies this man could use because if he said it this way look where it would be he said it this way look where it would be and he says it just perfectly we get all confused but just think about it see we're going to Millennium is going to be the honeymoon the honeymoon is going to be the Millennium a thousand years I read you one the minute where he said we'll be there building houses and things I ain't worried about working I enjoy it most people are lazy and don't want to work you know that four-letter word is dirty W RK you know but I've always just worked on my life and it wouldn't bother me to get there and just just build houses cuz it's not going to be like it is now right I mean I don't think you're going to have to worry about hitting your finger with a hammer how that would be I don't know but I ain't worried about it if you did it ain't going to hurt you cuz you're going to be in a glorified body cuz we're going to read that the second but you see it's just things you don't understand the brother R says it way in the future home he said there will be things in the Millennium that will not be in the future home that's correct absolutely that's his word right but just think about it that's what hit me we're going to the wedding supper of the Lamb you know no matter what you think about god let's see if I can get the r ter you know there's never a time that the lamb won't be present right right that's right when we leave out of here and we go to heaven the lamb will be there yeah but the father will be there but it won't be a pillar of fire over here and a halo over here and a little bird flooding around here we're just going to see him and know who he is if we could just if you could take what you have right now and be able keep what you have right now the words you have and back up and stand there and look at him as he was standing there and when he said unless you believe that I am he you'll die in your sins you you scream heyen I see it but you see it had to come the other way we didn't have it back there so we wouldn't there all right but listen going to a honeymoon going to a honeymoon y of the Bride of Jesus Christ in our groom go ahead to the next one 64 823 questions and answer number two will there be people on Earth in Corporal bodies during that time yes sir we will have our glorified body right here on Earth eating drinking building houses and then living just like we do now for a, years and it's the honeymoon of the bride and the groom right now I know that I shouldn't be I try to keep people from running off on the deep end now to a lot of people when you talk about a honeymoon it means husband and wife you understand what happens on honeymoon but see we ought to clean that out of our minds that's the point of what I thinking going to go see if we're married to him doesn't mean that we are having intercourse the Holy Spirit never had intercourse with Mary to bring forth Jesus Christ see let's get all of that washed out amen and see they come to brother brandom and they said brother brandham will it be children born in the Millennium he said I don't know he said sometimes it look like they will and sometimes it won't but just remember There Is A Healer to be draw up in the Millennium right that will be in corpal Corporal bodies absolutely right y a gospel to the Heathen that's what he told us so there'll be people there in Corporal bodies will he be having babies I don't know cuz they know my business but now us there in glorified bodies I don't think that there's going to be any babies more no they'd be glorified babies and it wouldn't be babies because it'd have to go up to be about 18 20 years old quick as it's birth that wouldn't work you say well you shouldn't no I shouldn't even have to explain that but there's a lot of people are so caral in their thinking until that's what they think about they think about all this other stuff instead of seeing what a beautiful wonderful thing is happening right now in The Bride of Jesus Christ that she's pregnated with the word to give four children unto God that's a spiritual condition wonderful position right look to the next one look what he's saying here in Revelation of Jesus Christ this is Page 41 church hbook then we see that when these light of Israel have been joined in love to the Lord that's in the tribulation period right and the enemy has been destroyed that's armag Edon God will prepare His Holy Mountain his new Garden of Eden for the bride and his and her attendance for the Thousand-Year honeymoon upon the earth now watching as Adam and Eve were in the garden and did not finish out the Thousand Years now Jesus our last Adam and his Eve the true church WIll F fulfill all the plan of God see somebody's going to live a th years to prove the sin curses go but it's not being you why because we're Eternal right you ain't going to be worried about it right just think about it all I want to get is a point acrop we look one more paragraph 149 of questions and answers real three which is 64830 does the Millennium have to do with 1,000 years could it be a generation no a generation is wred in the Bible there 40 generation a lotted in the Bible is 40 years but the Bible said and they lived and reigned with Christ 1,000 years it will be 1,000 years upon the Earth cuz 1,000 years upon the Earth is only counted a time for Parable like to God as one day 1,000 years upon the Earth is only one day with the Lord that's what scripture says right as God cting time how many you understand that now so it's that Sabbath yep Sabbath day right Millennium yep when the church will no more labor against sin Y and Satan is Bound for a little season A Thousand Years cuz his subjects are all in hell now he subject and here's the church that's on the earth is redeemed and right in the presence of Christ so he has nothing he can work on so it's not a chain as I said a log chain it's a chain of circumstances he has nothing he can do he's helpless and hopeless just waiting for the resurrection ction of the subjects then they're separated as sheep from the goats Satan is bound A Thousand Years a millennial Reign we'll get back to a millennial point on that when we're we're trying to cover that in the next message or so but you see what I'm talking about the order of what's Happening we as the Bride of Jesus Christ will one day take a change of the body we meet our Lord in the air because he doesn't set foot on this Earth until the millennial rign in a Corporal physical body that's what your Prophet said but we meet him in the air and we go to a marriage of the lamb as we go to the marriage of the Lamb then after that marriage is finished there will be a marriage supper right wonderful time during that period of time that we're being married to him and the marriage supper brother brandham says he slips back down here to reveal himself to the 144,000 now I've got my own thoughts S I ain't got no quote from brother Brandon but I got a thought I don't know what yours is do you think that he's leaving us and he slips out what's the point right can be there with us and be down here y absolutely right right he can be revealing himself to the Jews and still be with us right right you say well I don't know where it's true or not well he's up there and he's down here now so I just turned it around on you if you can't see it one way you surely won't see it the other that's right but if one of them right the other is he's right here with us now that's right right brother R said and brother Mark was bringing out yesterday outside of the Corporal body he's here just as much as he was when he walked a short just not the Corporal body right right but see then he doesn't have to slip away that's terminology that's words right he doesn't have to leave us right he can just be right there with us Brother Gary and yet he can IM morphe himself right down here to those two witnesses cuz remember one thing I quoted it let's see if you remember it he doesn't set foot on the earth in a Corporal body until the Millennium so revealing himself to the Jews is not a Corporal body right right come on I lay them down to where it get you get thinking then get move over and lay it down and just chop it off say there it is think it over he's not hearing a physical body to those you said but they say where did he get the nail print that's because of the Revelation in their hearts that they have seen Jesus Christ and they know that he has nail prints in his hands and those nail prints was there to make you and I his bride but they'll know they have rejected that R amen and that they must give their lives for what they believe big man in this message when I first run into some brothers they said brother so and so says the 144,000 won't be killed the two witnesses won't I said well I don't know what brother so and so talking about because my Bible says they will that's right that's right if you want to change the Bible to fit so and so that's all right but it ain't all right with me I want to see what the word says amen right but you see a wonderful time is coming you and I as the bride of Christ right amen and this honeymoon won't be just for the end time bride no it'll be for the entire bride right all Seven Ages Ephesus M perus AR Philadelphia lady right the Bride of Jesus Christ will be there in at that marriage to the lamb and be there at the wedding supper and then we'll come into the Millennium when a honeymo amen now some of you know which way I'm fixing to go because the scriptures to written but some don't so let me just ask you some simple questions what do you think God thinks of you you don't ever sit down and just say Lord why in the world did you choose me never do that oh my said Lord I think about some of the most marvelous people of their lives and their doings and way they everything and then seemingly because can I quote brother RAM on that he said there were flaws down for each one that he chose that's in the church A's book paraphrasing he said he chose Moses that he had a flaw he chose everyone and you know he even chose and I remember this from B back years ago brother Mo and I were up our family up in the mountains and this man was talking about uh Joshua was a perfect type of Christ and I said that's right except for one thing he said what I said he had one flaw Joshua didn't have no flaws I said sure did yes sir I said I'm quoting brother brandom you know you you CLA to believe him think Joshua told his daddy and him to tell them they were sheep her no wasn't sheep herders they were cattle herders J goat they didn't want to be no sheep herders and goats they be be Catt he lied see that was brother Brandon when he come on out later he said see Joshua had one flaw but see everyone that's ever been chos and has got a flaw right that's right I'm looking at him whether you like it or not and you're looking at me so that's all right we just look at each other and see all the flaws that's what I talking today about so you just don't worry about it just take the word I preach cuz if you look at me you're going to find plenty of flaws right but look at the word see where it ties together but what do you think in God's word does he think of you if I can prove by the Bible and even the writings of the Bible so beautiful but what God thinks about you will you believe it amen amen we accept it right we accept it in stages as the marriage is in stages we're married to him now and we're being united with the son of man the word here in this end time of the Bri and one day we go to the marriage of the L right take all of those things that I've tried to get you to see because that way people just take a one-sided view on something and and you leave out a lot of beautiful things and you know what do you think about what God thinks of you I know I'm no English person and I'm not a theologian but I got a little sense in the Bible when a word a noun is the name of a person place or thing right right a pronoun is a one that would take the place of a noun and uh there is certain ways that the word he which always mostly would signify a pronoun but that word he if it's emphasized correctly can be a noun see that's where we miss it and if your Bible doesn't read this away and what I'm going to get through I'm not telling you to throw your Bible away I'm just saying some Bibles doesn't totally italicized words they don't use what is known in English is Major of a point of uppercase and lowercase you know have you ever noticed in the Bible that it'll it'll be great big letters sometimes yep and sometimes the word God is spelled g o d but sometimes it's spelled g o d uppercase lower case over in the book of Hebrews is the only time that you'll find Hebrews one the word god used in the form that it's truly meaning the big capital letters look in your Bible while you're while I'm talking if you want to see it it says God Andra times and divers maners that brother Joe can find that in a hurry Hebrews 1 he's got a great big D there great big G he said well it's because it starts a sentence now there's something else trying to be said there see now they don't even use it there but it's big letters God but see in John where speaking of it says God is a spirit that's a little bitty G's they using it see if you get in your Bible and look at it you'll see that Hebrews one will give you a big G all right if you got a Scofield bible especially you'll see this a big G now the best way for me to determine anything you'll find it over in Genesis if you read that it says God it'll say the little g o d but then after a while it'll say Lord God and Lord is in bold capital letters you're looking at it in reverse but I have to give it you know l o That's r d you say well what is that mean it means there's more of God being revealed and then in a little bit you'll find it in Genesis it'll say big G God and little L Lord that's in there for a reason because the writers the Scofield coming from the words to bring it down to us and brother R said you see he said where says God created all things in Genesis said really you read that Capital Elohim right Elohim but if you'll keep one thing in mind while you're reading and you'll see that it'll follow throughout the word then when he's using the little G and the little L it's always something God speaking down to earth to mankind down here but when they a riter like Abraham referring back and looking at him he's saying the god of Heaven come down to speak to me so you can be a little Lord you can be a little God no you remember the prophet in explaining it he said when there's a little e on the or little yeah Angel when there a little a he said that could be an Earthly Messenger right he said but when there's a big a there he said that's a Heavenly messenger see Church what I'm just trying to get you to see is God has trying his best to reveal himself amen right right amen and you go in in Matthew and you're reading in Matthew about the birth of Jesus and it gives his name one time as Jesus and it's very bold capital letters that's right but about two verses down it's back down to a lower case when it's referring to his name as the god of Heaven his name is Jesus he said well what's that got to do with what we talking talking about see after the Millennium I mean excuse me after the marriage supper right we're going to take a victory ride Y into the millennial Reign that's amen a lot of people preach standage we're going to come back fight a battle I just don't get it that way I don't think just something wrong you say yeah the scripture says but you're in glorified bodies what kind of a battle are you going to battle you see a lot of that battle is going on right now right here in your brain when some of you are sitting there saying what in the world is he talking about is he some kind of a doctor or lawyer or now old you something the Lord showed me a long time ago that when I look at things and I see that Capital LD it's all way through the Psalms and you look it'll be God speaking to [Music] me you find a little L that can be down here can actually be an angel or a person you remember when Jesus was talking he said they asked him a question he said let me ask you a question he said let's see if you'll answer it that's right he said David in the Psalms in the spirit or by the spirit which one it uses there said the Lord said unto my Lord yeah right Jesus said now he was Lord right lose his son yeah question they just got up and walked out cuz that's the best thing to do then you better say anymore but see what do you think that mean the Lord said unto my Lord Sit Down On th my Throne until I make thine enemies thy foot right is that two Gods two Lords no it's sh me that the god of Glory condescended down to mankind to reveal himself am Y and you'll find all the way through the New Testament that there's a middle case used of Jesus Christ except the one time that it says Jesus is in bold letter rest of the time it will be in a form of of a middle case not a lower and not upper because God was on Earth dwelling in a man amen right what is a wonderful opportunity then but let's look at what God does and uses for mankind go ahead brother Joan number8 and pull up the scripture in first Timothy and let's just look at the scriptures 1 Timothy 6:15 which in his time who's he talking about who's he talking about Jesus Christ right who is the blessed and only potentate they do have it right here the king for y of Kings read it yep go in your Bible and read it he's the king of kings and Lord of lords right who's that referring to we know who he is y we know who the king is but who's the Kings go amen right will you get over chapter 5 of The Book of Revelations you want to read it chapter 5 it says that we are Kings and priest that's right look it up and see if it ain't little cases that's right that's right you want to do it while I'm talking go ahead look it up and see if there little cases it doesn't say there in Revelations 5 no go at Revelations 5 the wedding is not complete n right right you say yes it is no there's something still withholding there so it's referring to us as do he's King of Kings it's referring here blessed is the only potentate the king of kings and Lord of lords he is right now look at Revelations because this is used three times in the Bible First Timothy 6:15 Revelation 17:14 and Revelation 19:16 is these words are used king of kings and Lord of lords you have King of Kings many other things you have Lords of Lords but these are the only times they appear together Revelation 17:14 getting on up there where the brides at bring their close these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them he is Lord of Lord and king of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful but you still don't have your Victory ride the finality of God revealing himself to mankind is not made known yet you say yeah but if we get to heaven that's all I want to do that's right that's good but I want to ride back with him into the [Music] Millennium don't you well then after 184 come out of her my people that I tried to preach Sunday and his wife has made herself ready and the marriage of the Lamb is come that's in Revelations 19 verse 7 now you're in verse 16 which is coming back into the Millennium right you want to quote downi you where the prophets in Daniel 70 weeks that this is the victory ride yep this is the this is the ride of coming in this is us coming riding back so now look what it says re and he hath on his vesture on his th name written king of kings and Lord of lords all of is capital letter amen that's what he thinks about you amen until this thing is over with and we leave out of here and even when we leave out of here we go join him in the sky there's a wedding in the sky a very suffer and then a ride back into the Millennium y amen you know that brother Rand in Daniel 70 week says that when we ride back with him in the Millennium the anointing is upon on the bride to the Millennium Temple right mhm see when it gets over here up here the whole plan's not done in Timothy Revelations is still not finished but when you come into Revelations 17 is not Revelation 19 ain't no difference in him and you right I didn't write the book I didn't make the statement that the Bride of Jesus Christ will be the fullness of the godhead bodily I didn't write the book that says the bride will be the son of man those are statements your Prophet made that's what God thinks of you every what's written on his Sky is written on yours when you come riding back everybody wants to know what the new name is right but they think that some way if we find a new name we'll be able to get these bodies Chang I haven't exhausted or you use that word I haven't done away yet with the name of Jesus I'm still seeing things I said brother randam what about that new name he said referring to one part of it in the church ages he said maybe it'll be when we get when we get there but see that's what everybody thinks that it's got to be some kind of a new name and something that brother R's got to come back somewhere and tell us that new name it says there in the Book of Revelation that he has a name written that nobody knows but he himself that's right that's about verse 12 13 somewhere coming down to that but it says on that Revelations 19 that we're king of kings and Lord of lords and he has a name on his sty written which is the word of God what else do we need you mean brother Dale you're just trying to tell me that Jesus's name is the word of God that's what Jesus's name is is the word of God is that right his name Shall be Called Emmanuel why didn't they name him that they did that's right they did cuz Emmanuel means what God With Us right Jesus said unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins that's brother Brown said the only name that God ever had is Jesus that's right amen Jehovah is not a name you even go back to the Old Testament said by my name Jehovah was I never known Yahweh is not a name Jesus is his name you said yeah but I'm looking for a new name brother Dale well what are you doing while are you looking well I'm just standing waiting for to give me that name I got everything else when I was born I got all these virtues and things that just was in me brother said it wasn't n a you kind of missed the boat somewhere do you see my point of what I'm saying he thans so much of us until he doesn't separate you go ahead and pull that on up brother Joe just in case some of you think that even this the the strong concordance don't verify what I'm talking about pull that up to the J the Life part Brother Anderson I'm kind of hard on sometimes going up to the next now 9335 9336 King of the Jews King god king Christ king of Israel leader of the people Prince Commander lord of the land King 9:36 Reign King to be king or to exercise kingly power to Reign to exercise the highest influence to control and Timothy when it uses it's talking about him as Lord is this word King of Kings King of Kings that's in Timothy King of Kings the god of glory and his people to be king to exercise kingly Revelation 17 it is two-part word King and Kings Revelations 19 verse 16 it is both 9:35 you go read it when you home he's showing what we're going to be amen that's right but why can't we believe we're already amen at least we ought to believe that we're Kings and Priests right y you know and if we're Kings we got to have something to rule over and we're supposed to be ruling over sin right we're supposed to be getting ready well we're in the stage on the earth we'll wind up with those little Kings all the time but when we come back riding in the Millennium you'll be king of kings he shows no difference between him and her right amen amen see if you think things don't work out look over in the scripture there where he's talking about Elijah when it says that it be capital letter turn in your Bible while you're looking I can't remember the scripture but some of you can call it out and when Moses went to the burning bush you get a chance read it when it says I am that I am they're all in capital letter I am that I am amen there was no angel talking to Moses no right that's right it was God himself do I need to quote we don't believe in brother Brown being de i' done been through that a minute ago but you know there is a tape there where that brother brandom is speaking and all at once God uses his voice and said you're not hearing William brandom said you're hearing me well that shouldn't have be hard to [Music] understand shouldn't be hard to understand when a prophet says that a born again Christian take the word of God on his lips and speaks it he said it's deity speaking amen that's right there shouldn't be any problem right but yet we belittle ourselves and we don't try to look at What God Says about us amen that's right you see I like to talk to other people cuz I get things talking to other people they think I don't they think I'm sitting there thinking I'm going know it all they don't know nothing they don't know nothing but my mind's running when you're talking brother Mark was explaining something yesterday and he said he doesn't say a lot he's kind of quiet you know but he said that old man he said I saw it back there in that Old Testament said when that man walks up there and L his hand on that lamb and that priest cuts that throat he said that man has got to believe his sins goes in that lamb the price was paid all is you're exactly right Y and I said but brother we got to believe that when Jesus Christ died he died for my sins amen amen that man went away free from his sin but somebody just hasely walk up just throw a lamb down say here sacrifice that and I'm going out and do it again his sins wasn't forgiven I've never believ that if you do you're I want to sell you some stocking alcatra or something but listen church if we can't believe Jesus Christ paid the price then we're missing our Salvation that's right amen that's right he became me that I might become him right right come on you s Victory ride we come riding back into the Millennium as Victorious not as even just Little Kings not as little priests no brother BR said the anting will be on that bride to anoint that Temple but you know what that's just a victory ride because a red you there out of the future home where he said it was just just a journey going right on the end of that future home going to be a wonderful place in the future home we W be looking down on each other you w be looking down on somebody else and say boy I'm bigger than you are I'm great than you are I'm Bri you w even be there you got they got a lake of fire for them to yeah right you see people should read the Bible with what brother Bram says when he made this statement and then I was reading the scriptures I thought that's hard to get brother Brown brother R said no man will be cast into hell without being judged first you agree you need a quote and that would be at the whiteone Judgment right [Music] y but you need to go read your Bible That's [Music] right The Beast and the false prophet are cast into the Lake of Fire before y the white read your Bible Satan yep will be cast in the Lake of Fire TR but you beast in your false prophet it's not meaning listen it's not meaning people because you'd be R around him you'd miss him he said everybody's got to be judged see the Beast and the false prophet is a symbolic symbol because it takes many to make the Beast there were many false prophets does it mean all that would be false prophets be cast down and all it would be the Beast no no no we're not getting it it's a symbolic form showing what God thinks of it just like he burns Babylon he burns Babylon the Beast and the false prophet is not just counting human people it's a symbolic form you see now I know why the prophet could say it he said God cast no man into hell in first until he's first judged the Beast and the false prophet is not human beings it's a symbolic form of understanding see because Satan's cast in later Satan don't have to be judged he's already
