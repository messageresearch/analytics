circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we said that Faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness not in circumcision uncircumcision and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of

much and everything and it's an honor and privilege again to be here and I've been telling my brother Bob we'd be here for so long kept you know we had every intention of being here so we finally made it after about seven years or so and uh I was joking with brother Bob you know I said well now you know God is Not subject to time and we're his creatures so we're not subject to time so don't hold it against me amen but we're here and we're so thankful to be here my wife and I have enjoyed ourselves so much and I know that we're so happy to be gathered with each and every one of you Saints of like Precious Faith we're gathered you know we may all come from different backgrounds we may all come from different families but we all come from God the same father amen that's that's what makes us all brothers and sisters and that's that's what makes us have Fellowship because we come God has allowed for each of us to be brought up in a certain background to bring about certain qualities in each and every one of us and to bring us in amen so God bless you again this morning I'm probably gonna say that many other times before we close because brother B said that's the that's that's the greatest thing you could tell somebody was to God bless them because he said if God blesses me that's all I need amen amen so we're going to begin this morning reading out of three different places first place is going to be Colossians chapter 1 second place is going to be in Ephesians I'll give you a minute to get there I've even got to take a minute third place is going to be Romans chapter 8 we start with Colossians 1: 16 the Bible reads for by him him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence amen amen over in Ephesians the 1st chapter 17 verse that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he hath wrought in Christ Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his right hand in Heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and above and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all and Romans 8 one verse there Romans 811 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you thank Jes he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen amen let's go in prayer dear most gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful to you again for this opportunity Lord to be gathered in your name father God and to look into these things and we're so thankful to you oh God that you've called us as an end time people Lord to to walk where the wise people Lord and the Sages of Ages gone by could only could not walk father we're so thankful that you've called us up higher than that father you've come you've opened your word to us Lord I pray oh God that you just help me Father God help your people help us to get out of the way may your spirit have preeminence in this service oh God we pray we love you Lord and we just ask that you again bless each and every one in Jesus Christ's name we pray and ask all these things amen amen God bless you as you're seated I want to speak this morning on the sunrise which is the proof of his resurrection amen because we know that Jesus raised from the dead a lot of people say he raised from the dead but there's a way to know that he raised from the dead amen because God does not just if if he does something he's going to prove because God brother Ram said that God proves his word and we're taught by the prophet in the church age book that God cannot change that is the theme of the whole message that Hebrews 138 is that God can't Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen and brother Ram said the Keystone of the Bible is that God cannot change so once we get a revelation in our hearts that God cannot change how he acts the first time is how he must act each and every single time Amen brother brandom called himself a apologist another word for that is scriptural because brother Brandon was able to look at what God did the first time in type and see what God was going to do throughout the entire Bible because God does not change that is how he was able to identify God coming down to Abraham in a body of Flesh to discern the thoughts of Sarah's Hearts because he did that then and he was able to identify he seen the picture he seen that God was in flesh coming to his bride Discerning the thoughts of Sarah's hearts and he seen the two angels that went down to Blind Sodom and Gomorrah so he looked in the Bible and he said well what's next the fire's got to fall right exactly and that's what's going to happen because God does not change right he's seen how Joseph was treated by his Brethren how he was rejected by his Brethren he read how he took a gentile wife and was able to preach the entire Bible from that single story exactly because God does not change that is the Keystone is that God does not change amen so it's important that we know our place in the scripture right it is important that we know our identification in the scripture because that is what brings perfect Faith Jesus himself knew his place in scripture right amen Jesus was subject to his own word come on right Jesus was subject to his own word and you know whatever the head goes through the body must also go through because where the head goes the body follows amen so everything that Jesus experienced we must experience amen he found his place in scripture we've got to find our place in scripture he suffered and he left a little suffering for the bride as well because we are his body come on amen he we are his body so when we're able to find our place in the scripture then we're able to tell what's going to happen we're able to see what has been you know we're we're in this situation this is what God's doing next we are able to prophesy based on the Bible come on brother isn't that what Revelations 10 8 to1 we eat the book and then we prophesy Revelations 10 1-7 is Jesus Christ descended with the Shout with seven Thunders amen that and he came and fulfilled that and what's the other part it's the bride's part 8 to 11 right that's what the head done now the body is supposed to eat the book right and then she can prophesy again right when she eats the book and knows she recognize her day and her message she recognizes the presence of God didn't the prophet preach a message the presence of God unrecognized sir he comes and does the same work that he did 2,000 years ago and they don't recognize it bless right brother brand in the message future home of the Heavenly bridegroom in verse 267 there he says and if you are bride the Bride is a part of the husband right and the only place that you'll ever recognize it is recognize what part of that husband that word that you are or you can't recognize being bride thank you Lord how many sees that see see you have to recognize your position come on because if you don't recognize your position you don't know where you stand and then the devil can beat you around but Jesus when Satan came to Jesus Jesus knew exactly who he was he knew exactly where he stood yes siren and he fought off the devil's Temptations he defeated the enemy on down in the same same sermon there in 270 verse 270 said then Jesus said in John 14 when he the Holy Ghost has come he will bring these things to your memory see show you what day you're living in and then another thing you'll know him by he'll show you things to come see right back to the prophetic again when he's come see thank you lordess the Holy Ghost will tell the bride will show the bride exactly where she's living we show her in the scripture that this Jesus Christ is doing this this is what he did this is the day and hour you're living in that's right true because that is how the foolish virgins missed the Rapture is because they don't recognize the importance of the oil until it's too late and then they try and go get oil on but it'll be too late right and the trumpet gives an uncertain sound Jesus brother Ram saying again he said destroy this Temple and I'll see what I can do about it he's asking the question you destroy this Temple and I will raise it up again in 3 days nothing uncertain now I'll try you all might stand around and see if I can do it or not I know I will raise it up nothing uncertain I will raise it up you destroy it I'll raise it up oh my why he know that he was that person in the scripture that David spoke of I will not leave his soul in Hell neither will I suffer my holy want to see corruption amen and he knew he was included in that scriptural promise so therefore he was positive because Jesus knew exactly where he stood that's why in Luke chapter 4 he can go and stop exactly at what part of the verse pertained to him in his day and then say this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears the Pharisees and the religious people of that day were still trying to look at what Moses said right Moses spoke of him but they had already Twisted it all around that's right he said brother r says this he says now can't we be that positive we take him example for other things as long as God's word said it can't we be as positive about the word as he was about it I am the re I am the resurrection and life I will raise it up again amen why he know the word spoke of it and he was sure to come forth if I'm the person over there in John 5:24 he that Hearth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and I will raise him up again at the last days he'll not cometh to judgment pass from death into life that that's us what are we scared about what's the matter amen so as long as Satan can keep you from knowing where you stand he's got you amen exactly but when you realize your position because with position comes Authority because Jesus was able to cast Satan out by the Finger of God because he knew he was God amen glory he knew exactly who he was he knew what in his message he knew what he had to fulfill he knew that he had to come be expressed in flesh die be buried be raised again he knew that and the bride knows what's got to be done she knows there's got to be a Rapture amen so the question is are we preparing for the Rapture right because that is what's at hand right amen right we're not trying to build an ark right no that was God's plan at one time but it's not anymore that's right you know God sent a prophet he fulfilled Malachi 4 and we praise him for that but he fulfilled Malachi 4 so now he's got to fulfill other scriptures he's got to fulfill 1 Thessalonians 4:17 exactly the Rapture that's what's next right we're not looking for God to send Malachi 4:5 because he already did so if you're looking look at Malachi 45 still looking for Malachi 45 and not accepting God's Malachi 45 his interpretation of it then you're missing the mark right so we know that the church is the body of Jesus Christ and everything that he did she must do she must go where the head goes exactly so the church after the day of Pentecost began its Ministry just like Jesus did and all signs and its wonders right healing the people amen yes people are all excited but we find that after a while that the Sanhedrin Council and the different religious organizations of the day were trying to constantly arrest that word they were constantly trying to put him in prison just like they did Jesus they trying when he say something against their belief he they try and stone him they'd actually pick up stones and go to Stone him but he slipped through the crowd because his time wasn't yet am every detail of Jesus's life was based upon this word right on when it was time he went to the Cross but before then he didn't because in the Garden of Gethsemane he tells the disciples he said you know know you not that I could call 12 or talk to my father and he'll presently send me 12 Legions of angels but he said but that the scripture might be fulfilled he couldn't do it right see Jesus was subject to his own word right exactly and brother brandham was also subject to his own message because it wasn't from him he had to listen to his own sermons I've heard him on tapes say that he had to go back and listen come on sure because he was like a microphone yep exactly and God just spoke through him yes sir and sometimes he'd have to even repeat what he' say he would even you know after he say something he go praise God let me say that again he was getting it just as fresh as we were you know God would meet him in a vision or give him a message but when he stepped up in that anointing came forth come on he was getting it he was getting it so after three and A2 years they finally crucify the Messiah so I want to type that CU you know brother Bram tells us that we type Enoch and the church World types Noah as they go through the tribulation or over it or through it rather and we're delivered but at this in other instances we also type Noah because we are in the ark which is Christ so it all depends what angle you're taking it on because the bride just like every scripture points to Jesus Christ Glory but the bride will see sealed in Jesus Christ just like Eve was sealed in Adam so when you look in the scriptures and you see Jesus Christ we've got to see our own identification in there we must see our own identification so just as they got Jesus after three and a half years they finally got what they wanted so the church ages after three Church ages it went into a Dark Age they finally got their way right right amen they finally got their way the church World finally got their way and got the compromise they wanted and got the influence that they wanted at Nasa right in the message Masterpiece 1964 brother BR says at that night I see a council of 15 days of bloody politician debate when them Aristocrats come in and wanted to inject these big dignitaries into the church and the prophets come out of that Wilderness there eating herbs and wrapped in animal skins genuine prophets and they throw them out why the seed has got to fall into the ground it's got to die it died in the Dark Ages down beneath the dirt the dark dirt they thought it was gone you know St John 12:24 Jesus said except the corn of wheat falls into the ground it abides alone and the first church was that reproduction that bride that seed that word made manifest that fell into the ground at n of Rome listen Church throughout the Nations that will hear this there is your dirt right is them denominations there is where the word was crucified and they accepted dogma and for hundreds and hundreds of years of Dark Ages the power and manifestation of the word was hid from the world only Catholicism ruled we all know that as reading history only Catholicism rules right exactly right so do you see how the scriptures repeating itself yes that's right after three and a half years they got Jesus They Crucified him and he went in the Tomb with the Roman seal right and after three Church ages they got the word and they broke it down mhm and they took over the nicadan spirit you see that in the church age book so now the word he said brother Ram said here that they crucify the word and that it was in denominational dirt because Jesus said and his words can't fail that except the corn of wheat fall in the ground it abideth alone so that corn of wheat had to go in the ground just like he went in the ground because until Jesus died and was resurrected the Holy Ghost could not come exactly they had one man to deal with but after the day of Pentecost they had 120 because that corn of wheat went into the ground and when it came back up it was in a multiplied form yes sir so the church has to go through the same thing because she's the body so after three after three ages she goes in the dirt yep y just like he did in the message restoration of the brid tree said now notice after 3 days the first tree restored is at the beginning having the same signs same wonders Jesus come back the same Jesus doing the same thing at the end of the third day the signs appeared not at the end of the first day oh brother remember these days are the these days are typed as ages or the ages are typed as days exactly he said oh brother I hope you're getting it at the third day is when the real manifestation of Christ was made known at the end of the third day amen see notice are you getting it he says not at the first day dead form second day there was a rumor see the second day was still dead Luther Wesley at the beginning of the third day there was a rumor around all right nothing on the first day Luther nothing on the second day and in the third day the dispensation of the Holy Spirit there was a rumor around that he was the same yesterday today and forever because the Pentecostal age started with the restoration of the gifts so after all this time people begin to see the manifestation of the spirit in ways that they had not seen it so it began to be a rumor right he said but at the end of the third day that's where he made himself known come right among them come right among his people and said look at me I'm the same one amen yes sir so you see there's been another Resurrection right brother Bram said that that they have named it Sunday Su n day before the bride It's s o n Sunday because there's been it is the rising of the sun amen it's the rising of the Sun so the body we see the bride going through the same stages the very same stages that Jesus Christ went through right there in the Dark Ages coming on up and then there's to be a resurrection right sure in the message it is the rising of the Sun because remember Jesus when he was resurrected he was only identified right when he did the same works right right that was the only way that you know because we have to believe him by faith abely so when Jesus Christ himself was manifested in the flesh he had to do what was written of him right AB and it was the people's job to study the scriptures and to see the Messiah manifested when he came because all they had was what was written that's correct yes and it's easy to say well Believing on Jesus 2,000 years ago would be a whole lot easier because he was physical in the flesh but that's not necessarily the case it took just as much Faith to believe that Jesus was God then as it does now because all he was was a manifestation of the word so when people seen him they said that can't be God how can God allow people to spit in his face y yep how can God be on a cross yeah come on brother but he was manifesting the word so because remember when Jesus asked Peter who do Man asked his disciples who do Man say that I the son of man am right everybody had a different interpretation of who he was some Isaiah some Jeremiah some one of the prophets some a teacher they knew something was there but they didn't quite not everyone really understood but the elect of the day was able to identify and say I know Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God right the Bible did not describe the physical appearance of Jesus other than just to say that there's no beauty that we should desire him right right but the true description of the Messiah was his fulfillment of scripture right amen and when he fulfilled the scripture to the letter that was identification of the Messiah he gave the signs of the Messiah amen and we're about to get into that he gave his signs and he done what the scripture fulfilled and yet for all that people still were blinded at that was the Messiah yes sir that's right they claimed that they were Moses's disciples but if they would have been Moses's disciples they would have believed on Jesus if they were true Disciples of Moses because Moses spoke of him Moses spoke of him because they rejected the word and when they rejected Jesus they said we are moses' disciples we don't know who you are we believe Moses their very actions prove they did not believe Moses they were religious yeah come on but they were not the elect right amen they were not the elect let's go to St John this is the morning of the Resurrection St John chapter 20 and as we go along I want us to look and identify ourselves in the scripture amen right because brother Bram said that Elijah was sent to the widow woman because she had the same nature he did right right amen so we're able to see when you read a story in the Bible and you see right there because remember we're sealed into Christ yep we are sealed into Christ and we must put ourselves right there right because Ahab had three Syrian campaigns three military campaigns against the syrians and Ahab types the United States as we know oh yeah in between the second and third Syrian campaign Elijah comes and condemns he and Jezebel and then Ahab dies on the third Syrian campaign and his blood runs out in the Chariot in the evening time right right amen right and Kennedy see brother brandham had to be on earth at the time that Kennedy was manif was President because he had to be there because it was that way in the Bible Elijah was on Earth at the time when Ahab and Jezebel was on the throne the prophet of God was on the earth at the time that Kennedy went into office right he didn't have nothing against Kennedy as a man but he knew the spirit behind that he could see it in the scriptures so Ahab died in the evening time between the second and third Syrian campaign amen the campaigns typing the Wars three world wars and Kennedy was shot in his car in his Chariot and his blood ran in the Chariot so do you see the exact scriptures repeating itself exactly so we place ourselves there in between the second and third campaign and see that Elijah came out and condemned Jezebel and Ahab amen see we place ourselves there in the scripture when Elijah in 2 Kings 8 went to a widow woman when she had seven years of famine let's go to Second Kings because I want to I want to drive this in Amen to where you really understand 2 Kings 8 sorry brother Joe that wasn't I didn't originally have that down I want to read this so that we can understand of how old testament stories point to Modern Times And we identify ourselves with them scriptures amen 2 Kings 8 then spake Elisha unto the woman whose son he had restored to life saying arise go thou in thine household and sojourn wheresoever thou can sojourn for the Lord hath called for a famine and it shall come upon the land seven years and the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of God so she went with her household and sojourned the land of the Philistines seven years we know a woman in the Bible types A church right in verse three and it came to pass at the seven years end that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land and the King talked with Gesa the servant of the man of God saying tell me I pray thee all the great things that Elisha ha done and it came to pass as he was telling the King how he had restored a dead body to life that behold the woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her land and Gesa said my Lord oh King this is the woman and this is her son whom Elisha ha restored and when the king asked the woman she told him so the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even until now so she was gone for seven Church ages and then the king God himself appointed a certain officer his Prophet to the bride to restore everything that she lost in the seven years all seven Mysteries amen so let's get back to St John 20 this is the morning of the Resurrection so we identify ourselves with that widow woman who was restored by that officer that God appointed so we Place ourselves there in the scripture and we see the exact exact thing because remember the Keystone God does not change exactly come on St John chapter 20 we'll start with verse 11 but Mary this is the morning of the Resurrection but Mary stood without at the Seiler weeping and as she wept she stood down and looked into the seeler and seen two angels in white sitting one at the head and the other at the feet remember that would be like Paul and brother brandom oh yeah two angels there remember this is the morning of the resurrection and we're at the morning of the Resurrection it is the rising of the Sun so let's keep this in mind as we read here and see the events as they transpire because Alpha is Omega Jesus is not associated with part word like he is with full word he's full word and Alpha is Omega right and he really identifies himself with a pillar of fire at the beginning of the age and at the end of the age that's right am where in verse 12 where the body of Jesus had Lain and then over there in Luke you know the story is told a little differently they're told the angel tells them why seek ye the living among the dead and that's a good question to the bride why and as an individual why seek ye the living among the dead if Jesus ain't in the Tomb then where is he right he's got to be somewhere because if he's not in the Tomb that means he raised right amen so if you want life you've got to be where Jesus is because he is the light amen glory so the Bible them angels in Luke you can just write this down 245 tells them why seek ye the living among the dead and they say unto her woman why weepest thou she says unto them because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him and I want us to remember Mary types the church the bride specifically exactly Mary types the bride because brother Bram said and pick up your pen and write that the word was in The Bride amen she received the Spoken Word By An Angel and became pregnant with the word right and the bride is to do the same thing amen because God's continuity does not change it cannot be broken and when in verse 14 and when she had said thus she turned herself back now remember Mary being a type of the church the Angels told him why seek ye the living among the dead she didn't know where Jesus was and she turned herself back and saw Jesus standing and knew not that it was Jesus right people would come out of the denominations when brother Ram was on Earth and knew knew that God was doing something right but couldn't quite put their finger on it they just knew God was on the move so the bride turned around they seen Jesus standing there the message but they didn't quite understand yet Jesus saith unto Heroman why weepest thou whom seekest thou she's supposing him to be the Garder sayith unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou has laid him and I will will take him away yeah so Mary is seeing Jesus but she's not recognizing who Jesus was not yet right verse 16 Jesus saith unto her Mary she turned herself and saith unto him raboni which is to say master when she heard her name called she knew that Jesus that was Jesus resurrected he didn't brother Ram say when we hear the word of our day we've heard from our theophany you hear you say how do I hear my name how what does it mean that I find my name in the book it means to find your identification in the book that's right because we're sealed in Jesus Christ sir exactly what I just read in 2 Kings 8 one of the many examples is a perfect example of identification you say well God that's seven seven years that's seven Church ages there's been a famine the word been hidden the word's been closed up they just had portions but at the end of the seven years at the end of Lady OA God appoints an officer to restore everything back so you see yourself there and you identify yourself with that scripture Glory God sent her Elijah and God sends us Elijah who was a widow because our first husband is dead should be right the denominations right if it's not the only way to be married to Jesus Jesus is for your first husband to be dead and that could be you know worldliness that can be a life of sin that can be religion right right that can be denominational religion that could be message religiosity right because remember that brother brandham said that God does not have grandchildren right amen so even though back then he was dealing with the Pentecostals and he said God does not have Pentecostal grandchildren the same thing applies to the message that's right God does not have message grandchildren right amen everybody must come the same way no matter what right the prophet of God himself had to come the same way God does not make an exception for anyone so we see that Jesus called her name out of the book and when he did she immediately identified him as Jesus then she said Master she knew based on what he told her right that identified him as the Resurrected the Lord Jesus Christ amen Jesus said that my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow that's right Mary was a sheep of God and she heard the voice of her master and turned around and knew it was Jesus because before he spoke to her she didn't know who he was right and think of this she seen him in the flesh before his crucifixion right but after his resurrection she didn't know until he did the same works so you cannot not classify or identify Jesus Christ by crown of thorns and nail scars or anything it's got to be by the same Works he is the same yesterday today and forever Glory where the same works are done that's where he's at that's where he's at let's go to Luke chapter 24 another interesting thing is that when you read you'll see that after the resurrection of Jesus he only identified himself in secret right yeah before his resurrection he was open with things he'd go and he'd heal but after the resurrection only the elect seen him right exactly the Jews paid off the Roman soldiers to say that some that the Jew that they came and stole his body Jesus never appeared to cus anymore right he never appeared at the St hedrin anymore it was then only to the elect that seen him that's right they knew he raised from the dead because he appeared to them he proved his resurrection to them because God don't have to prove nothing to Satan right but brother Ram said that God proves his word glory and we are his word made manifest Glory he's going to come and get us out of here he's going to come and he whispers his secrets to us that's right the husband doesn't whisper secrets to any woman it's only to his wife so after the resurrection in Luke 24 verse 25 this was on the road to emus remember they walked all day with him and didn't know it was him absolutely yes sir all day with him and he started expanding to them scriptures and they had no idea it was him until he done something that was familiar right am and when it was familiar what he did before his resurrection their eyes were opened but until then they didn't they weren't open in verse 25 and certain of them which were okay he's talking over there to them on the road to emus he's coming on down and then Jesus tells them after he starts open up the scriptures he said then he said unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ have suffered unto these ought not Christ have suffered these things and to enter into his glory then he begins the scripture and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them and all the things all the scriptures the things concerning himself he didn't expound the things concerning Moses and things because they were in type of who he was Moses and Elijah and Noah they were all a type pointing to something amen their lives were led by the Holy Ghost to point to Jesus Christ as a shadow in a type verse 28 and they drew nine to the Village whether they went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went into to Terry with them in the evening time and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break it and gave to them he did something familiar right and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures that's when Jesus broke the bread he gave it to him their eyes came open wait a minute this is what he said before that they would they could never understand when Jesus would talk about his death even Peter tried to hinder him yeah they did not understand right they had not understand to this full capacity especially right so after they begin to understand then opened he the scriptures and after he break the bread their eyes were opened and they knew him because not because they saw Jesus remember he walked with them in a physical manifestation all day long and they didn't know it exactly until he did what he did yesterday and that identified him as Jesus and that identifies him as Jesus every time is when the word that was written for the hour is made manifest true the ark was Jesus Christ when Noah preached because that was the word of the hour amen and people couldn't see nothing but an old man building a ship they missed the mark amen but he was preaching the message of the hour the message of the hour should be no new term because the me there's been a message for every hour right that's no new term that's no new word Jesus was the message of the hour he is the message of the hour Jesus was the message of Noah's hour Jesus was the message of Noah's hour on he tied both the Passover they were eating and the blood that protected them from the death angel he's all in all yes amen he was the message of the hour amen and he is the message of the hour so how can somebody try and separate God from his word word how can somebody try and separate the message from the Bible come on because the message is a manifestation of what was written right come on the message makes this live because the Bible says that the letter kth but it's the spirit that giveth life everybody that claims Christianity has this but only the bride really understands manifestation of it the body of Christ because the head the body has to do what the head did does the body depends on the head to move right the body can't move without the head the head is the controlling Tower and they that are led by the Spirits by the by the spirit of God are the sons of God Amen so the same chapter in Luke 24 this is another instance verse 36 and as they and as they thus spake Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you and they were terrified and a frightened and supposed that they had seen a spirit they didn't recognize him and he said unto them why are you troubled and why do thoughts arise in your hearts behold my hands and my feet it is I myself handle me and see for Spirit hath not Flesh and Bones as you see me have and when he had thus spoken he shed unto them his hands and his feet and while they yet believed not for Joy wondered he said unto them have ye any meat and they gave unto him a piece of broiled fish and an honeycomb right and he took it and did eat before them and he said unto them these are the words which I spake unto you while I was uh yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me then opened he their scriptures then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures after the resurrection right come on before they didn't understand right he spoke in Parables and he'd even try and break it down for the disciples but their understanding was still they didn't understand it right but after his resurrection he opened the scriptures to them and that is how he was identified as the Messiah not walking all day on the road to emus they thought he was just a traveler right not when Mary met at the tomb she thought he was the gardener right brother R preached a message who is this when he came in that Palm Sunday the whole city was in an uproar who is this let's go to another scripture St John 21 these are all scriptures after his resurrection because that is the hour we're living in right I'm trying to by the grace of God to to show you how we're living in the same time because this was after the head was resurrected after 3 days so now he's coming this end time to prove his same word in the same way when his church the body has been resurrected by the same quickening power Romans 8:11 if that same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you then it will Quicken your mortal bodies so if the spirit that raised Christ from the dead don't Quicken and uh doesn't dwell in an individual or in a church they won't be raised St John 21:3 this is after his crucifixion the disciples brought discouraged just like they were on the road to emus think of how defeated it looked to the Flesh in the natural eye right everything they had hoped for everything that they that they just imagined in their mind a preconceived notion that Jesus would do it just abruptly ended When They Crucified him but that was Victory it was absolutely Victory so they're all discouraged in verse three Simon Peter saith unto them I go a fishing they say to him we also go with thee they went forth and entered into a ship immediately that night they caught nothing and when the morning was now come Jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus right then Jesus saith unto them children have he any meat they answered him no and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and he shall find all right now hold your spot right there and let's go to Luke 5 just hold your finger right there because Jesus they didn't recognize Jesus on the shore but in Luke 5 just a couple verses there in four and six they're fishing the same thing Y and when he had left speaking we'll start verse three and he entered into one of the ships which was Simon's and he prayed him that he would Thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship now when he had left speakon he said unto Simon launch out to the deep and let down your nets for a drought and Simon answering said unto him Master we have tolled all night and have taken nothing nevertheless at Thy word I will let down the net and when they had done this they enclosed a great multitude of fishes that their net break that's what he did before his crucifixion and his resurrection right so that's experience they never forgot so back to St John they were doing the same thing they were fishing Jesus came on the boat they didn't recognize him right and in verse six Jesus tells them and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and he shall find they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes does that sound familiar Hebrews 138 that's what he did before exactly therefore the disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter it is the Lord y amen John immediately said wait a minute the man told us to cast The Net that's what he did before he raised from the dead that's Jesus because he did the same thing amen right now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he GED his father's coat unto him for he was naked and cast into the sea and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from Land as it were 200 cubits dragging the net and as soon as they were come to land they saw a fire of coals there and the fish lay thereon in bread and Jesus saith unto them bring up bring up the fish which you have now caught Simon Peter went up and Drew the net to the land full of great fishes and 150 and three for there were so many yet was not the net net broken exactly because Jesus said that all that the father had given me will come to me he's not going to lose any of them right because remember brother Ram teaches us that when the gospel is preached or when a call is made you've got fish you've got spiders you've got Turtles you've got water bugs but there's real fish in there too right that's right over here it was fish and the Bible said that the net was not broken there's not one of them that's lost right Jesus saith unto them come and dine and none of his disciples Dar ask him who art thou knowing that it was the Lord Jesus said come and D we're living in a come and D age amen we're living in a come and dime age and we know that it's the Lord there might have been some guessing way back at first but now we know it was the Lord right and no man D to ask is it the Lord because we know right we know he resurrected from the dead because he does the same thing right so see without the resurrection there'd be no quickening power without the resurrection there'd be no identification in scripture like this without the resurrection there'd be no message there'd be no there'd be no seven Thunders there'd be no seals there'd be nothing without that quick power because the same quickening power that raised Jesus from the dead broke the seals on it's the same quickening power because he done it himself and Jesus said I have power to lay my life down and I've got power to raise it up that's right he laid the church down and he raised her up right because he laid himself down because that corn of wheat had to fall into the ground and that confuses carnal minded people too yeah that how could God do them things and let the people go through that dark Dark Age but there was an anointing for that amen they were anointed to be sacrificed with that Ox anointing right amen he said in the message it is the rising of the sun he said as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of them that slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church have to be a sheath waved again in the last days oh my waving the sheath what was the sheath the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat and that proved it was a sheath Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word is turned back again and his full power being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there amen because I live ye shall live also you live also speaking to his wife see he wasn't just speaking that to the church right right it was to his wife Glory right because I live ye live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was waved back to them on the day of Pentecost the word made manifest now as I say it's to be waved again in the last day and brother brandom is not God he's bride is that right but he was the first one that came to maturity in the age and he was waved over the people and the bride is to walk in the same steps now that's not to say we're going to have a Ministry where we deser and thought that was for him but we're going to walk in the same places of believing God like no one else can because he stood stood Pat upon the word when everyone else walked away you remember in in my new ministry he talks about where Deus has forsaken me and everyone has forsaken him just like with Jesus everybody loved the fishes in the Loa everybody loved getting healed but when it came to the word they walk away from it and the Word was the whole point right but see how that word makes all the rest of them all the you know the first and second pull attracts the little fish right attracts them and things and then it scares all all of them when it comes to that third pool which what catches the fish which is what catches the fish in the net here right that they were bringing up the rainbow trout now the body as I said has got to have the exact same ministry as the head does correct amen because it is the same right now Jesus had three pools is that right brother R teaches us that that Jesus had three pulls and the and brother random had three pools because it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now there's also three phases of the third pool right you have speaking the word that's the third pool you said let there be a squirrel God created it that was the third pool when he opened the Seven Seals that was the third pool right preaching to the souls in prison is also the third pool he said that in Souls that are in prison now he's talking about Noah and his heart is breaking he said God could it be this third pole when this message is preaching to those who can never be saved and he refers to all three as the third pool now Jesus cursed the F tree right he opened the word and he went to hell to preach to the souls that were in prison abely and the bride has got to do the same thing because we are his body am that's right Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever that scriptures quoted a lot and it should be brother Braham used it a lot but when you really get it anchored down you realize the importance of that scripture as all of them right because if he wasn't the same yesterday today and forever how could we know how to expect how could we expect uh how should how can we know how God's going to act but brother Bram was able to pick up the story of Abraham and Sarah and Joseph in the very first book of the Bible and preach it all the way to Revelations with 144,000 because God does not change with that very principle amen that's right that very principle right there that God does not change you know brother Brandon was so humble you know I hear so many testimonies where he said he always where people to say he always made the other person feel big and you and you and you can hear him on tape where God had given him the responsibility to bring bring the word for an age to call out his wife yet he makes it act like he's just I just have a seventh grade education all these brothers are so much more qualified than me I'm a typologist I don't have the education to get in there like these other brothers do but he was the one that God had sent he had more Revelation then people had theology but he had Revelation and that's the thing is when someone just follows this message intellectually yeah they can be talked out of it just like they were obviously talked into it but when you get the message and you bring it back to the Bible and you weave it together it's impossible to separate because the message is the interpretation of what was written amen yes sir so that shows that we're intellectual to begin with because if someone if you're doing something in the best way that you think and someone else and tells you there's a better way to build a house well you were just this is all you knew so you're going to go by it but when it's been revealed to you there's no there's no talking you out of it because it's a part of you and how could you deny yourself impossible no St John chapter one I want to bring this down now to not only Jesus's first resurrection but also the resurrection of the word the day on bring it down to our day because that's how the Bible should be read that's how the Bible should be interpreted and that's how the Bible should be understood is what's going on today I appreciate what God did yesterday but what is he doing now I appreciate what he's going to do but what is he doing now and remember the prophet of God said that's the problem is that people are always praising God for what has been they love what he's going to do but they're ignoring the thing that he's doing right ignoring the things that he's doing St John chapter 1 we start verse 40 the son of the Messiah that's how they recognize Jesus this was after John the Baptist identified Jesus one of the two disciples which heard John speak followed him which was Andrew Simon Peter's brother he first findeth his own brother Simon and saith unto him we have found the Messiah which is being interpreted the Christ and when he brought him to Jesus and when Jesus beheld him he said Thou Art Simon the son of Jonah that Shall be Called sephus which is by interpretation a stone the following day Jesus findeth Jesus would go forth into Galilee and findeth Philip and he saith unto him follow me and Philip was of BEDA in the city of Andrew and Peter Philip findeth Nathaniel and saith unto him we have found him of whom Moses and the law and the prophets did write Jesus of Nazareth the son of son of Joseph now you see Nathaniel's confession when he seen the sign of the Messiah is that this is who Moses wrote of when the Pharisees and other religious orders of the day seen it they said that was be elub and they both claimed to be Disciples of Moses oh yeah so who were the true Disciples of Moses those that went on with the word because Jesus said if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples verse 46 and Nathaniel saith unto him can there be any good things come out of Nazareth Philip saith unto him come and see Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and saith of him behold an Israelite indeed of whom there is no G Nathaniel saith unto him whence knowest thou me Jesus answered and said unto him before the Philip called thee when thou was under the Fig Tree I saw thee Nathaniel answered and saith unto him Rabbi Thou Art the Son of God Thou Art the king of Israel Nathaniel knew he was a student of the scripture and he was expecting the Messiah so he was not going by how Jesus was looked but when he heard the sign of the Messiah when he witnessed it for himself he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Thou Art he that was written Thou Art he that was supposed to come to pass that was prophesied of right and he did the same sign for the nation of Israel right but what was different is what their attitude was toward it right it that was the difference amen we know the story of the woman at the well the same thing amen and remember a woman types the church come on the woman was coming with her water part to get water to get Spirit she seen herself in need and God himself was there Amen in flesh right and he discerned her life and he told her that I give you water that you don't come here to draw right amen you don't come to this sister here to draw I'll give you what but she'll never thirst again because when she identified him as the Messiah she left her water pot she didn't e it anymore right cuz she found the water she was looking for amen that's what the church has done right because Jesus said that he'll give Everlasting water out of his belly shall flow rivers and a water pot you only have it for a little while you keep having to come back from one Revival to the next but she had rivers of ever flowing river of water so we see the the the sign of the Messiah that Jesus manifested to the nation of Israel amen so now that was what he did yesterday so now I want to read quotes to where you see what he's doing today what he did right and then see if you can discern that that is the same Messiah that they crucified 2,000 years ago in the message do you now believe brother RS in a prayer line and only the prophet of God could go in the scripture tell the story about the woman at the well about Phillip about Abraham and then he himself turned his back to the audience and do it right and do you know that people that obvious of a manifestation people still missed it and disbelieved preached for an hour or two about Sarah and Abraham about God coming down in flesh before Sodom was destroyed turn his back and discern Sarah's thoughts and he himself do it right and they still missed it he said now just a moment I heard a name your husband is his first name Lewis or something anybody said Lewis is that right and I see your house number it's 631 at 45th Street it's right here at Palm Beach is that right and you're going to be well and Jesus Christ makes you whole God bless you your faith your faith saved you lady now go on believing him just be reverent and have faith and on down and looking for Jesus quote 72 he said yes sir you believe me to be his Prophet you might have a mighty good faith and now you are suffering with stomach trouble is that right it's caused from a peptic condition in your stomach that's right you are also a very nervous person that's what's causing stomach condition and doing that is cause you to have hemorrhoids I see you have some kind of trouble coughing or some it's asmatic condition isn't that right and you also have heart trouble is that right you believe me to be his Prophet amen then I see somebody standing near your side it's a woman it's your wife she's got something wrong with her on her face cancer is that right and look your house number is 1154 on McKinley Street and your name is CB DT is that right go home and be made well and lay your hand on your wife and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now is that the sign of the Messiah right amen he done the same thing exactly and he's doing it after his resurrection he told them to cast their net on the right side of the boat yeah right is a special Ministry that comes to the bride in this end time let's go to St Matthew 21 21: 18 now in the morning as he returned into the city he hungered and when he saw a thick tree in the way he came to it and found nothing thereon but leaves only and he said let no fruit grow on thee hence hence Forward Forever and presently the Fig Tree withered away Jesus spoke the word to that fig tree and when the disciples saw it verse 20 they Marvel saying how soon is the Fig tree withered away now that was God in Jesus speaking authority to Creation on he spoke to that thick tree and said no man eat of you from from this day forth and that thick tree obeyed him that was the spoken word right Jesus spoke the word to creation and it obeyed him in the message Hebrews chapter 2 brother R is talking about the fish and a few weeks ago I seen a fish killed laying on the water all of you heard the story of it there's brother woods and his brother and them standing here to witness it that little fish laying dead for half an hour on the water with his anils pulled out of his mouth and the great Holy Spirit swept down and he said the day before you're going to see the resurrection of a little animal and the next morning after a little after sun up we saw that little fishy not over that long when the spirit of the Lord came down and said little fish Jesus Christ makes you whole and that dead fish had been floating on top of the water for practically a half hour and came to life and swam away as hard as he could oh blessed be the name of the Lord how wonderful he is so you have Jesus exercising the spoken word over fig Tre there and you've got Jesus exercising his authority over creation here it's the same thing it's the spoken word because only God can give life and life comes by the spoken word right that's true creation comes by the spoken word mhm come on because God didn't write let there be light he said let there be light amen and that word cannot return back to him void just like you know over there in in Jeremiah where Isaiah talks about as as the snow falls as the rain falls and it fulfills its purpose it's not going to come back to God void he said so will my word right and the bride is the spoken word of Jesus Christ and she sent to the Earth to do what he purposed for her amen and she's not going to come back empty-handed she's not going to get that talent and go bury it somewhere she's going to get that Talent she's going to multiply it she's going to invest it she's given so we are responsible for what we're given for exactly the word and the Revelation that God gives you you are responsible for it right so we can't God forbid that we be ashamed of what we believe well God forbid that he gives Revelation well that's wonderful but let me bury and not tell nobody oh my come on Revelation belongs to No One it belongs to God and he gives it sovereignly and when you God reveals something to you in whatever form it is whether it's a prayer it's a song it's a sermon it's reading your Bible listening to the prophet it's your responsibility to tell somebody about it it is your responsibility to believe it and go invest it oh not bury it on because you know what happened to that servant that buried it he was afraid to go and and invest it that's right y so we know the story of Jesus for the sake of time when he went out in the ship and there arose a storm and he was tired as a man and he fell asleep in the boat and the storm was coming the disciples were afraid they were about to die it was tossing he was so tired he didn't even wake up where the disciples go and they wake him up Y and Jesus said peace be still that's right and the disciples marveled because all of creation obeyed Jesus because he was God and we see that God comes down this time and gives the same authority to his Prophet exactly remember when he he warned the bre and he said the snow storm's coming in 30 minutes or so you're not going to be able to see your hand in front of your face as soon as the first uh sleep or snow or snowflakes fall you get down from the mountain he had already had it all set up and he himself had to get down and he started going down and the spirit of the Lord told him to turn around and go back where you were you talk about trusting God and knowing because he was walking right back into what looked like death exactly God told him to turn around and go back and he just at there that's all he knew what to do you know the the that U that lady that brother R talks about you know that ancient Mama about about how she knew that she was looking for that elishah she identified selfelf in the scripture with the widow woman and she had a son that needed help right right so she said Lord you know where's your Elijah right absolutely see that identification with the word with the power of it brought Elijah to her right and she got her son restored cuz she she told Brother brandom she said eyes like that shunamite woman right y she identified herself in the scripture amen and looked for that Elijah to come amen and brother brandom the spirit of the Lord told him to keep walking he had a plane to catch right but the spirit of the Lord told him to keep walking right glory and he kept walking and that PL that plane was delayed because of the faith of that woman that Faith was delayed I'm sorry the plane was delayed that's right see how powerful faith is so God gave the authority to his Prophet to speak to a storm right let me read it cuz he says it best he says I will s there I thought why would you want me to come up here I doubt very much I can find my way down now getting so terrific I could see about 10 or 15t maybe could hardly and hardly that far sometimes not over 5T getting rougher all the time well I thought well he said come back all I know to do is sit here and the snow then about an inch or inch and a half maybe two inches on the ground it' been about 20 or 30 minutes and it was blowing so hard it was blowing it away too and I just sat there just a moment and I Heard a Voice voice he said I am the god of Heaven who created heavens and earth I jerked off my hat cap and I just kept still set still and I listened again I thought that wasn't the wind oh it was blowing making noise and I heard it again said I am the one who steal the winds upon the Mighty Sea is the same Jesus he said I am the one the Creator I created squirrels in your presence I did these things I said yes Lord I believe you said stand up on your feet I stood up on my feet to my feet he said now speak to the storm it'll do what you'll tell it to do now that is true I when I meet you at the Judgment I'll have all this to answer for I said storm go to your place stop and son you shine normally for 4 days and no more than I said that the sleep and Hell which was about to blow me down just stopped and within a moment or two the Sun was shining right down thre upon me the spirit of the Lord came and told the prophet of God I am the one that steal the waters I am the one that Ste that steal the storm there in the gospel the same yesterday to today and forever now you speak right and calm the storm right the same yesterday today and forever and you can take that and run with that and apply it to every area of your life because brother brand represents the bride storm is what's going on with you come on you stand up and you speak to it amen and it'll obey you yes amen because the spirit that was in Jesus to make him calm the storm was the same one that was in brother Brandon that made him calm the storm and it's the same one and the Holy Ghost filed believer to make you calm your storm it's the same thing so see here's an example of a story out of the message that you can identify yourself with amen because the word of God is eternal glory you can identify yourself how many people how many times do we hear testimonies of people receiving healings from being called out in the prayer line with the same condition right yeah sitting down standing up maybe even wearing the same clothes right and they receive their healing amen because God is Not subject to time so we had the resurrection of Jesus Christ he came and he secretly made himself number KN only to his disciples come on brother only to his disciples the one the cist and all the ones that all the Romans and everyone that crucified him knew no more than nothing right even Josephus said talked about uh the communion about how they took the body of Jesus and were eating it and things carnal don't understand right but the Believers the 120 on the day of Pentecost understood very well amen but he went only to his elect right everyone else didn't believe righten if the disciples there Peter and John try to go tell a an acquaintance about what happened how Jesus rose from the dead and how he put the net and told them and witnessed to them if they were not elect well you just imagine that right I don't believe it it was only for the elect amen it was only for the elect so Jesus resurrected he made himself known in secret to his disciples amen now let's go to Matthew 27 and just watch how beautiful the order of the scripture is because that cannot be broken Matthew 27 verse we'll start with verse 51 and behold the veil of the temple is rent and Twain From the top to the bottom and the Earth did quake and the Rocks rant and the graves were opened and many bodies of the Saints which slay slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection when he went into the holy city and appeared unto many so the Saints and that's injected because then it says in verse 54 then went the Centurion and they that were with him and it keeps talking about the resurrection so it's injected in there that there's to be a resurrection after because Jesus was the first fruits he had to be the first one to be resurrected right then the other Saints did right so God comes in in his end time he makes himself known he opens the word to his bride and there's a resurrection that's right there's a resurrection that is the next thing let's go to real fast let's go to St John 11 I'm sorry brother Joe that wasn't on there either St John 11 you can read the whole chapter and things when we get home I just want to point something beautifully out to you we find that Lazarus had died and Jesus again being subject to the word could not do anything until the father showed him so he purposely stayed away right and kept himself busy so that he would not go back there and heal Lazarus because that was not the father's work he was supposed to let Lazarus die so he could go and raise him up from the dead that's right so see Jesus himself said I do nothing but what the father shows me first see his subjection to the word Glory when he read the word and he read the Psalms of David and he's saying I shall not suffer my Holy One to see corruption in things he knew that was him right so he could stand in the temple and say destroy this temple in 3 days I'll raise it up right amen he was able to prophesy so in chapter 11 there you have the story where Jesus is now on his way back he's on his way back to their house of Mary and Martha but he doesn't go straight to Lazarus first right he goes to Mary and Martha first right he goes to Mary and Martha and he gathers the living one he gathers the living ones first by the shout gathers his bride together right look in St John 11 we'll start with uh verse 21 then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou has been here my brother had not died see Jesus came to them first and I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it thee Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha saith unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the light at the last day one of my favorite scriptures here Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this she saith unto him yay Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of God which should come into the world right and when she had so said she went away and called Mary her sister secretly right saying the master is come and calleth for thee it's a secret the master is coming and he's calling for us exactly secretly amen then excuse me then he goes to lazarus's grave and raises up the dead right the dead in Christ do rise first before we're raptured that's right but he's got to send a message first to gather the elect come out of her my people come on and he comes in secret amen the master is come and calleth for thee right in absolute secrecy then they then he goes to the to the grave of Lazarus and raises him up see the order of scripture cannot be broken yes sir LED of the spirit the order of the scripture cannot be broken so in Matthew 27 you have the same thing you have the crucifixion of Jesus the word resurrects CU he's got to resurrect first right and then the Saints resurrect right just like over there in Revelations it says behold I come as a thief in the night it's just injected right in there it says a thief come on the prophet said the bride is going to be a little group and do you know that brother brandham said talked about Jesus how he would purposely say things to thin down the crowd now that can sound say well why would God do that because he knew who they were from the beginning he knew they were only after fishes and the loaves he knew that his disciples would not be shaken by what he said right amen you know and it's I my opinion I think it's easier now than ever to be to just fit in the message class but everything that can be shaken will be shaken right so everyone that that are just intellectual and can't cope with the word will leave because they were always after something else anyway but those that are truly Bride Can Never Be Shaken that's right they couldn't explain what Jesus said right at that time they didn't understand right so we see the picture exactly the same Rome was in control then and Rome is in control now just like they put Jesus in a Roman seal the Roman soldiers guarded it and things they tried to put a Roman seal on the word but he broke it and he resurrected amen he broke that Roman seal that's right so we find that after the resurrection after the Saints rose up from the dead they ascended with Jesus am is that right they ascended with Jesus well after that you've got people who tried to resist Rome oh yeah right sure and they were they were killed Titus came and destroyed them they called them zealots I believe right where they try to take matters in their own hand because they're hoping that Jesus would restore the Kingdom so they missed the mark right and the word they didn't listen and they didn't get out of Jerusalem when they seen that abom ation of desolation coming up right they didn't leave because they weren't true believers but they try to resist the mark of the beast and their own strength and the blood ran out the streets you see the exact picture Titus came and enforced Rome's mark on everything that was left and the blood ran up to the bridles of the horses it's already been foreshadowed so we see that okay Christ is resurrected from the the dead he's the first fruits what's next it's the Saints he's Gathering us we're Mary and Martha we've been gathered we're on our way to lazarus's grave come on and you look at St John chapter 12 and there's Jesus then goes to a supper right after he raises up Lazarus from the dead he goes to the supper and after the Saints are raised from the dead and we're caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air we go to the marriage Feast we go to the supper the scriptures cannot be broken right am we see the exact same thing the exact same setting and the blessedness Saints of being able to recognize your day and your message can never be overemphasized because we've been graced by God's grace and his Mercy because we're no better than anyone else God forbid any of us ever have a spirit like that we're never better than anyone else it's by God's grace that we're called it's God's grace that we're called his Grace and his Mercy but to be able to see because no other age really understood what day and age they were living in until the last onea right that's right that's when the understanding was opened that's true up until then it was just in Shadow and type Luther didn't understand the message that that that the messenger or or that the age went from this date to this date and that God was not had two more ages to come because he had to keep them in constant suspense of the coming of the Lord had they known that it was still going to be three other ages and a Capstone and all these things they would have relaxed right but God told them behold I come right constantly keeping them on edge constantly keeping them in expectation of the Fulfillment of the word right and it always always takes Faith to believe the manifested word just like brother brandom you know he talks about how people would say oh if I would have lived in that day I would have been on Noah's Ark had I lived in Moses's day I would have believed he said you check your present condition right because remember Jesus is the message of the hour right of any day right of absolutely any day let me see I thought I had a brother rman leadership he just brings it home he talks about I thought I had that quote with me but in leadership there he talks about how it's one of the last messages he preached and he's talking about how only Jesus Christ is eternal life he's the only one that can give it and he says even this message that we're bringing now just learning it cannot give you eternal life you've got to go to Jesus to get eternal life so I think that a lot of times people may get the misconception that they've got to understand the word yeah you get to Jesus and he's got eternal life and he is the word then he'll lead you and guide you into all truth it's not about knowledge it's not about learning on it's about knowing the Lord Jesus christall brother Bram is preaching here closing in the sermon trumpet gives an uncertain sound he's talking about the Garden of Eden how God gave us gave Adam and Eve in the church everything that ever needed be that they would ever need to be fortified he said now the enemy spy Satan try to find out what he could do to break into that so he knowed he just could come out and bluffer so only thing he could do was to get her on reasoning right and that's what God uses today to fortify his church as his word and Satan comes around with reasoning power is that cloud really yeah Jes Jesus Christ descending yeah or is it I don't know reasoning yeah because brother says here Satan know that was the loophole that was the place that people would break the easiest was that reasoning because Satan had 6,000 years of of knowing man he knows mankind better than we know ourselves he knows the weakness and he knows exactly what to stay away from and everything he said you say now let me just reason with you now is it necessary if God said it was necessary it's necessary whether we have to cry and boohoo and do all this if God said the baptism of the Holy Ghost is necessary I don't care how heavy it is and how much of the world you have to give up he said you're going to have to use it one of these days to stay alive the only way of survival that's right he said the Holy Ghost will be the only way of survival because because it's Christ in you believing his own word and that is the only thing that won't be shaken because God will not deny his own word that's true it is impossible for God to deny his own word so how can he deny you if you are the word expressed exctly you cannot be denied because you are the word expressed if this spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you then it'll also Quicken your body see the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead has got to do the same thing in his body right whether it's physically with the saints that have gone on or whether it's spiritually in the bride to the resurrection it's got to be the same spirit because he is the same yesterday today and forever and no man can call Jesus the Christ but by the Holy Ghost amen all these people that are denying the message are not called calling Jesus the Christ by the Holy Ghost and it's interesting it's something because Satan has gotten so slick before you know throughout people would just leave the word and go in the world oh yeah but now they're leaving the word to be religious oh yeah you see how it's coming up it's deny the message deny what God's is doing to follow Jesus yeah but they don't have the right interpretation of what Jesus is because when Jesus was manifested in the flesh he was the word made manifest so the word made manifest in every age is Jesus that's right people thought they were worshiping God when Jesus was made manifest people thought they were worshiping God Moses's way but that was God's way that was Jesus you couldn't worship Jesus Moses's way when God had already manifested himself in flesh he was done with him scriptures he moved on right right so we've got to recognize it is important that we recognize exactly where we are are plac in the scripture because then we know we are in anticipated in anticipation we know that the body changes next we know so we should be an expectation that's right of God's word being manifested we should be an expectation of our loved ones right that is the will of God is to be an expectation of the word that he's getting ready to manifest we're not in expectation of God sending Malachi 4 come on he did that and we we love him for that we're so grateful to you for we're so grateful to you Lord for that we're very grateful but be careful you've got to move along with the word as it comes move along with the light amen we're not trying to go and preach to the Jews to get 144,000 out because we know that God has two prophets to do that amen that is a blessing right to know exactly what portion that's right of the scripture is being that God is doing right now the present helping time of trouble right amen the manifestation of the word is Jesus Christ amen and it's the message that identifies him so perfectly right we see him doing the same Works Nicodemus and all all them people he said we know that thou are a teacher to come from God cuz who else could do these things they knew that God sent a prophet but for one reason or another they couldn't leave their denomination they couldn't they couldn't come on with it right right only the bride Will Truly Come on with it only the bride will really be there because in that day there's going to have to be oil in the lamp right there has to be oil in the lamp now but in that day oil you'll either have to have oil or you won't have oil right so you'll either go in with those that had oil or stay behind like them zealots who try to fight or resist the mark of the beast right because it all life on Earth will be wiped out the ones that aren't raptured they're all going to be killed that's right and then they're going to have to be raised at the judgment and answer for their works and what they done with the word as they know it because we're Justified and that's another wonderful thing that just so wonderful is the fact that God don't even remember your sins anymore because he promised that he would have a church without spot or wrinkle so sometimes we can be too hard on ourselves and Satan tries to bring something back to us that don't even remember Satan remembers and we remember because we're human right but God has the ability he's the only one that has the ability to forget and we are Justified amen through the blood of Jesus Christ amen the people on that day I mean I can't even begin to imagine trying to stand before God without the blood of Jesus that's right and everything be displayed on a screen like it will be with them right but for us as long as we repent and put it under the blood we have justification through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen God bless you Saints if we'll just stand to our feet thank you so much for the opportunity to share what I believe the Lord put upon my heart I just trust that God will just help us to meditate in these things and I was talking to brother Bob you know it's it's a wonderful thing to be able to retain the word that's heard right and I'm not saying that cuz I'm preaching I'm saying that that's my desire when I hear a brother preach when I hear a tape of the prop Propet is to be able to retain what's spoken and then God give me the wisdom to apply it to my life amen amen well I'm going we'll just go to the Lord in prayer and then I'm going turn the service back to brother Dale let's bow our heads to the Lord in prayer dear most gracious
