note right there away I was talking brother current or the current hat okay um but you go around 373 of the church age book and you'll find what we're talking about 10 pages backwards or for 373 Church age book okay I wrote that to myself I don't do that I'll I'll forget it okay Ephesians to father we thank you for this day and we thank you for your grace thank you for your love thank you for your understanding thank you for being you and we just ask you to come and be with us today Lord and open our eyes to thy word because that's the main part that we desire is to see you through the opening of you were to be revealed to our hearts we love you and we thank you Father we've been talking for quite a while about the new birth and being born again in things Lord and we pray that you would just help us all to understand the things that are required of us and then the things that take place in our life we love you and we think you bless and guide each one remember the sick ones among us and just touch each one deliver and God in Jesus name Amen cardi sister Johnny's not here brother Doherty he's still having trouble with his eyesight so remember him to pray for him okay seasons two now we read this for quite a while but what are we talking about for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God amen now let's go over to Joan of the coast we've been talking on salvation I like this of what it says in the Book of Jonah about this Jonah two and seven when my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord and my prayer came in unto thee into thine holy temple they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy but I will sacrifice on unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word and we've been for quite a while dealing with speaking on salvation now what we want to do now is to drop back and take our point and you know come forth in understanding about the new birth and the things and to be directed in that and now we're going to try to make it as though and I want you to think about this I hope to god that I can preach I've always said I had rather go to life finding out that I had something you know all of my time and all like that instead of going through life and finding out I didn't have it because you got a problem when you find out you didn't have it all right I want to try to preach salvation as simple as possible to where the children can understand but also the adults and I'd like to be able to preach it to worth it this is my goal to preach salvation to where everybody in the building and everybody that's listening in comes to a realization of their own selves of where they stand with God all right because that see salvation is the most important thing not our argument so well I believe this and I believe that we spent vast times trying to go through and you you go back and listen to the message and listen to the prophet in the way that he's describing it salvation is not speaking in tongues shouting glory hallelujah what is salvation salvation is the new birth all right and what is the new birth the Prophet said the new birth is the birth of the word or in other words a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you is your new birth all right see then we need to to think on these things and and here is my point if I could preach it good enough to where that you can realize that you're lost then I reach my goal to appreciate to realize that you're saved it's a great help and a greater understanding that's I'm serious about saying it now and listen I'm not trying to preach to get you to find out you're saved that's between you and God that is totally between you and God it is not you or anybody else is between you and God but to find out it's you're lost and need to be saved well that would be the great opportunity for that person to come to salvation all right and see then I want to prove as simple as we can and you say well brother Dale are you trying to tell me I'm lost that's exactly what I am trying to tell you that you're lost okay so no because if I can get you to realize you're lost a reasonable goal you said well you shouldn't be that way you need to bring us up and lift us up what good does it do to lift us up into something that we don't have no idea what it is what is the new birth brother branham Christ the mystery of God revealed the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you and season it's not to you in somebody else's to you all right then the birth is the birth of the word I want you to get that more than anything else could because I thought what I've always believed it to be and what I've always taught it to me the new birds I believe your prophet was trying to teach us what the new birth is then it's the birth of the word all right it's took Jesus three and a half years to plant that word into those disciples and then when it did then come forth the new birth all right then you say well is it gonna take us three and a half here I've tried to explain that we're talking about it last night at Bible study see the first account or the point of our braiding it you got to bring it from the disciples cuz that's worth salvation and begin and it did take them three and a half years so now is that right it took them that long to be able to come to a position to be born again all right but that doesn't mean after the end because he after that happened like I say it over and over it could take three minutes or three years or ten years whatever for you to be saved all right the point is that see on the day of Pentecost 120 in the Upper Room it had taken them that long to come to that place to be where they could receive what was taking place but see then my knowledge of understanding or by thoughts and ideas you get 3000 outside and they can receive Jesus Christ you get the house that canoeists they can receive Jesus Christ you get all of those things that can just happen all at once and receive Jesus Christ and they can go through what it takes to make the new birth what does it take to make the new world good to see our visitor back there with us today then we say welcome she can't hear it what's you don't even hear it one of these days let's see that's what I'm trying to get you to see the new birth is that word that's revealed to you all right now let's start as simple as we can to give understanding of this point all right now are you with me to follow me the first time it took three and a half years the next time it was just a our few hours or something sermon and do it we'll read some of that in a minute and they could receive the Holy Ghost why because they had at least heard a little bit of understanding all right now then in that it can move on in to giving understanding so don't think well brother Dale please you got a long time to be in your new birth no I believe you've got to be born again now whatever it takes how long it takes is none of my business that's your business that's between you and God that's your own personal experience of the new birth the you said well I believe the prophets message all right but that doesn't mean you're born again the devil believes it all right that's this blunt plain but this straight well I've got the only evidence I got I believe the probably meant I probably didn't say that is whether he said it's whether the spirit and you agrees with the word there's your final evidence that he brought forth as to give understanding all right he didn't do away with love he didn't do away with all of those things he just finally it come to a finality where he said the Lord showed him in a vision of what it is what the facts of the word the Holy Ghost inside of you making that word alive all right now the natural birth is the top of the spiritual birth okay and so that's where that Jesus starts with Nicodemus okay and he explains you know the new birth or you must be born again you must be born into water and I spirit right read your scriptures are all right as he gets to them to it or to Nicodemus to explain it then he's telling him the natural birth is the top of the spiritual birth the natural birth it takes what water blood life the spiritual birth it takes what that's why I said Jesus when he said it to Nicodemus Nicodemus was saying I can't understand you are you trying to say I got to go back to my mother's wound he said now if I tell you these things and you don't understand them what good is it good is it going to be me to explain spiritual things to you all right so he plainly you must be born of water and our spirit now he was plainly saying I have spent three-and-a-half years teaching the disciples the Word of God because what was he saying why didn't he say water blood and spirit he just says born of water and the spirit because we went to it explained that now because what the prophets say what the Bible say by the washing of the water of the word so the word is what was washing the disciples received the word take all the parables put you parables down how that the power was this power to take it and read you parables in the Gospels and you'll see what the new birth is it's the birth of the word it's the words you have taken the disciples the Bible said they took the word and one says it held it one said they kept it or something like that they've done that until the Holy Ghost failed when the Holy Ghost fell it fell on them that had heard the word all right so then faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word to be born again you're gonna have to start right we're not going to try to start with something much reading I keep saying it over and over you misunderstand me because I just make a statement and I know because yeah I try to cut down like messages instead of length in the mouth you think I'll run them out because you think I just hammer on something no I do have them on it because one thing's for sure you leave out of here you ain't gonna be able to say brother Dale didn't tell us what the new birth is well I don't know work out it or not yeah cuz I don't know well I've been told a new birth is it that's what we're talking about last night you know what's wrong with them I the majority of the Christian room you have been called a certain way or certain thoughts or certain ideas or some doctrinal idea and you take that as being the gospel instead of listening to the Word of God see that's why they couldn't understand brother Branham I can told you hee hee there he's preaching water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there are a lot of those people that were in that group that like 300 ministers a lot of those ministers there had been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if they were Pentecostal surely some of them fell in that class and there he was what would be against what would be against him brain because he was not bringing water baptism under regeneration because that's what a lot of them were already doing father son and holy God no Lord Jesus Christ but under regeneration because that's been a costal doctrine why and they was against that part all right but now let's get to the sea I want us to make it as simple as we can and start off where the children can understand alright so we can follow you know what is salvation now we went through a lot of things so let's go ahead and just pick up the scripture and read it and just look at the scripture so go ahead and pull up number 1 brothers we're not going to read the whole thing but you know what number you know what acts 2 is dealing with and when it starts and how that oh and the Holy Ghost had fell on the them in acts 1 and then you start into - is is coming forth of the Holy Ghost when they're explaining what it is all right so now listen to them explain it after they experienced it now are you seriously thinking with me what I mean here's Nicodemus and Nicodemus his idea is I've got him let go back to my mother's wound well what do you think the disciples believed come on think serious what did the disciples believe they couldn't have been much more above Nicodemus because they didn't get the baptism with the Holy Ghost until Jesus Christ died right they couldn't have so now let's go to them when they get the Holy Ghost and Peter describes the new birth okay let's think about what is being said now terrset like I said it now they Peter could have told you this before the Holy Ghost failed are you with me he could have told it but now after the Holy Ghost follows look what he said he's seen this before spake of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in Hell neither his flesh did see corruption now go back and read as I said verse 1 all the way through get the background of what's happening there over here the Holy Ghost Falls and then Peter and them is over here in a minute then we're going to read and they'll say what must we do but I want you to follow the thought of what we're talking about this Jesus have God raised or of we're all witnesses now my point listen it's impossible if you believe the new birth is the birth of the word that's left up to you I believe it firm believer of it I believe you've got to have the word to be revealed to you and if that's true then then it's impossible to get to new birth without the word stone for it's impossible to get a corn to grow in the ground if you don't plant the seed is that straight it's impossible so let's get the seed planted and I said about Jesus they took him three and a half years to plant the seed okay no what's him now as he starts Peter is telling them his experience now listen these geezers have God raised up we're we're all witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he has shed forth hid this whit which you now see and here for David is not ascended into the heavens when he said than to say if himself the Lord said unto my lord sit down my right hand until I make thy foes don't footstool therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ now Peter is laying down to them what has taken place you've crucified it you've done this well they could say well I wasn't there with him I had nothing to do that me that's the way we talk but he's telling them that now watch what takes place and when they heard this the message of Jesus Christ and his coming and giving his life go back to action - and read it all the way down you'll see that's what he's talking about that he's talking about Jesus Christ and who he is and what's taking place right now look what takes place and when they heard this when they heard them did you Peter it's alright faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word it's impossible to be born again unless you hear the word first okay is that closing straight enough well I didn't how well come on now and get off of the ceiling this nobody didn't teach me bless God I got it myself you read it out of a book so you got it from the one that wrote the book you know Bible whatever don't be silly with me on that part when they heard this they were pricked in their heart well when they heard about the Lord Jesus and what had happened are you following me Peter told them what had taken place and they were pricked in their heart okay now watch this we follow that point said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do are you listening they come to a knowledge a conscious state of something being wrong the word print is to pierce to prick to pierce to pain the mind there were something happening to your mind agitating that mind vehemently use especially of the emotions of sorrow so now when they heard about the Lord Jesus there was not great signs and wonders took place there were not great things going on Peter didn't say now you seen right here now we done raised four dead we doesn't that thing that happen oh he simply preached the sermon about the life of the Lord Jesus Christ brah and what had happened up to where they were and they become pricked in their heart they become concerned do you remember the day you become concerned do you remember your first thoughts or contact about salvation or maybe you never was pricked in your heart maybe you never was concerned iswhat I'm saying it I want to appreciate the work that you've got to make up your mind to decide what you got whether it matches the Word of God or not that's why brother Branham says don't come on now don't go back in the congregation and try to get them people to come to the altar he said it would be twice harder the next time am i right now because I've been there that was 18 years old my brother-in-law got killed in a car wreck and my sister she's always what and she always was a spiritual person she even felt God and things like that I'm not gonna argue with her about it but she came down and all and in the pews there where I was at and this is what she said she said Sam you know JC that he wasn't saved and said he's dead now and said he's in Hell and said you need to do something about it while you got a change well you know what she told everybody she was letter the Lord to come tell me that when your prophet said don't do that he says because you make them to where they're twice harder the next time to get them to come right you see was you pricked in your heart can you remember that can you remember when you started your journey of salvation because that's what we're trying to deal with right salvation is a journey being born again and all of that going through all it but do you remember when you first come to a conscious state or knowledge that you need to be saved what about it do you remember that well no I don't remember it well what happened you know because these when they come to a place that they were pricked in their heart about what had been told them about this Lord Jesus Christ and what he had went through what had happened to him had been crucified how the Holy Ghost had come back on them that's what Peters explaining had come back upon them and receive that new birth and they're out now being witnesses of what took place in their life now I know I'm hard and straight I'm plain if you don't remember where you started how do you know you started right if you don't know first off that you're lost how can you become saved well God does come down this dumped everything on meanness that's alright that's your problem they won't change you for what I'm saying because there's one thing for certain that pricking in the heart was not Peters words it was made are stirred by Peters words but something else had to take place what does it mean to be pricked in your heart what was what is the point when they become pricked in their heart about what had been taught them about the Lord Jesus and his life and his death and the things that had happened they become concerned right and as they become concerned and they said men and brethren what can we do I like it that away instead of what you think ought to be wrote there you think it ought to be wrote there what can we do to be saved now they were just standing there they didn't know what was going on except for one time they had become concerned in their heart something had happened to them because it had been brought to their knowledge by the disciples that had a witness that that this Lord Jesus Christ had died for their sins and that he had placed within them a call do you remember when he was called you remember when he was pricked in your heart you remember when you become concerned trying to talk to the children trying to talk you say brother daily so did he don't know I'm trying my best to break it right down to the baby form of what we're talking about you can't tell somebody how to be born again if you are not born again yourself is that simple enough well you could cause it yeah you could cause things to happen yeah but I'm talking about can you tell them what a new birth is what shall we do I like that better than just putting it what shall we do to be safe on that just want to know what can we do there's something happening that we're concerned you've brought our knowledge route to us the knowledge that this Lord Jesus Christ done all of these things died in our stead this is the message to the three thousand are you following me this is not the message to the Upper Room that's ax 1 X 2 you go down stars you go outside to the 3,000 of people that were just out there that had never heard about the Lord Jesus but when Peter got to his expressing about what this man had done they never just had never seen miracles they'd never seen signs and wonders to try to draw him the drawing was something else brother bob was hitting on this the other Linda's tee I mean the other day Sunday yeah what about it have you become pricked in your heart you see that's what telling you you can't convince people that's why brother Branham is telling you that you get people that they'll get up in front of a congregation they get people to move get them to do they now listen come on you're gonna get upset so go ahead you see preachers that can really bring people under a conviction preach things to do it I wish to God I can do that I'm not made that way but there are ministers I've watched him that could bring it it is like brother mote said one time he said these people were saying Redemption is over he said give me a hundred people and I'll show you he had that much confidence in his ability to contact people yet it was a deepest man in this message and I don't back off the yet he had a gift he could make kids weep their way to the altar it was a god-given gift because there's ministers who can do that see wives Peter it's not John it's not the eagle it's not the different ones if Peter Wright you remember there in the in the scripture in the book of Acts how that they had prayed for those people and praise one couldn't get the Holy Ghost come on them they sent up the for who it's for Peter and John I believe that's right now if I get the names wrong you put them together okay they sent for them to come down they come down spoke just a few words to the congregation the Holy Ghost fell on them there's people who know how to bring the presence of God to a congregation but I want to ask you another step did they continue on Billy Graham now I'm quoting your prophet okay you claim to believe him he said billy graham's that nobody had the ability that he had the Moriah because Billy Graham could bring thousands to the altar because he had a gift he could bring people weeping to the altar about their lives he said would you believe Billy Graham had a gift you're gonna argue with your prophet about what he said go right ahead help yourself I'm just gonna try to believe him because see all of those things always concern me when I hear a prophet say that Billy Graham has was said nobody can do it like him well you know what first off I got to do away with all of that other stuff that I thought he just whoo-hoo dude him up to it and he tricked him into it or her he's dead no he didn't get up and call out names now you need to come to the altar and you know you've done this and you don't you know Billy Graham didn't do that he got up there and preached it wasn't the other one that brought around was speaking up he said he can bring God one of you great men in his name and he said he can bring God I see Peter was chosen not John not under the rest Peter was chosen to bring the message because he had to gift his gift worked and he brought those people that had never heard a lot of them about the Lord Jesus but he brought him to a conscious state of what Jesus Christ had done and how he had died for them how he had saved you know everybody and had ever been at night he brought it to the understanding and those people then stood there pricked in their heart right concerned me do you remember when you first heard about Jesus do you remember that part can you go back in your life far enough to remember where you first contacted God now I don't mean you just thought about the first time you went to church most everybody would be here would be sad born and raised in church you know I'm asking you do you remember when you become pricked in your heart because that's the first stage the Prickett in your heart with the pricking in your heart is because at one time no man can come to God and unless he's called and remember many are called a few were children they're true let's hold that one right darkness for a second and jump over go to number three John 6 let's just read some scriptures cause you see something had to take place before they become totally pricked in their heart they had to get a knowledge and the knowledge tells you what was taking place now what did Jesus say no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him and I'll raise him up at the last day now you can't come to God unless he calls you that's where the trouble is at that's what I'm trying to get you to see there's people with ability to contact people to get them to the altar and God deals with that and wonderful but because a lot of them come to the altar don't mean they're saved cuz you go back in the congregation now well now you know now - you know now your mama now yeah you know and that scare tactics like I said my sister comes she said you know JC was not saved and he's dead in Hell now and you better get straight well I'm serious is convened I've told you this before it's on tape I would have took his experience with God over hers you see were you to use that - what you want to use it for she was telling me he was lost if I'd have said anything to her I look back sure to look back at her and said let's mean you both go to the altar because you need to get saved first the Prophet said don't do that I mean see telling soft love stories don't get people saved oh jesus loves you you need to do this you need to do that talking to the children you think that's gonna save those children this in church that's what I'm saying if you remember you remember they done that to you and you remember it never took you to Jesus Christ ain't saying it won't I said it didn't - the majority and probably the one sitting here me talking to you if you'll open up your own conscience enough to be pricked in your heart to realize what taking place you realize that you've done that same thing people tried to get you to come to salvation yet they tried to bring you the wrong way Peter was bringing them the right way he gets to it in a minute where we have time to get in for not we'll do it Wednesday one I want to be it just gets it to you simple this can be if you remember your first contact in church are you you know whatever or where you're at and home or whatever anybody talking to you about the Lord Jesus do you remember that did it lead you to the Lord well I went to the altar and I repented did you go to the altar - because you know I'm serious and you can do what you want to if my sister - kept on how to walk to the altar - got her off my back I'm serious and straight whether you are or not I would have done that - got her off my back because I wasn't concerned with that there was no conviction in my heart and told you she needed to be an altar the Deacon board in the church needed to be an altar the church the Prophet said has always been the thing that stood before mankind and God instead of leading us to God right you don't talk to your kids about don't do this don't do that because Jesus loves you and he's mad at you you're trying to scare tactics and those things won't work sure tell them about the love of God that he said his life to work they could have an opportunity to be able to be saved tell them the good side about the story but don't tell them about it to try to fear them into it then getting very few amens because you know what I'm telling you is hitting what I'm saying it's you know it's hitting because you know where you come from you know what happened to you in your life just be serious one time about it you might find that you are lost because if the people to try to lead you to God could not bring a point of being your conviction as we call it upon you then then it's become a hindrance then if we don't believe salvation is emotional situation and heaven help you with what you're trying to figure out what I'm saying I believe in emotions more than anybody in this building I've witnessed more emotions than anybody I can talk to about because I can tell you about seeing the Lord I can tell you about seeing the angel of God I can tell you about things that happen I can tell you about the witnesses of what happened into my life season I don't back up I'll take it and just put it that straight have you ever really had an experience I've asked you to read the future home go read the first 15 18 pages over and over and over where the Prophet said that that justifications that all it does is chops off you pi sins this does nothing to your nature your ways or being but what about it go to John 6 it was John 5 number John 6 and he said Darfur said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father now one of these days it will don't on us what the Prophet is saying which has always been one of the hardest things for me to follow you'll know what to hear the very fact of what the Bible said in the prophets it when it says no man assault god at any time you realize the Bible is telling you you never saw God the Bible the Prophet is telling you God saw you the Bible is telling you that the goodness of God leaders need in repentance the goodness of God something led you to repentance you realize it was God seeking you well brother Dale I remember when I cried enough right after I did too I remember two years after coming in this message that I'd listened to six books I mean read six books in one day and listen to two types all in that same one day I spent my whole life to learn this message because I knew if the message was right then I had the gold with in my hand I wanted the pearl of great price and I had it in my hand but the world didn't mean anything to me but I also knew that I wasn't born again and that's where we'll get to that one later we'll get back on like we said last night we talked about anointed ones you realized that there's no difference in the anointing of anointed ones and true born-again believers the anointing is the same would you admit brother Dale I'm an anointed one if you're not an anointed one you're not born again maybe get you listened to last night's message if you're not anointed with a genuine anointing of the Holy Ghost you're not born again Nova toxin or the ones rinses okay but look what he's saying Darfur said on to you that no man can come to me except it were given unto him of my father they surely didn't understand him right read the next verse from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him they just like Nicodemus they didn't know what was going on and instead of staying with a man that had to plan as we call it I used to like that old brother would because I think it's among the black people use the slang you got to go where the stuffs they happen or something like that you got to get where the stuffs and other would be he'd always say he said you got to get with the one that's got to stuff you know look from that time many of his disciples were but then Jesus said unto the twelve will you also go away now you want what the Prophet said you remember what he said about that anybody won't quote it for me then said Jesus unto the twelve why don't you go also that's why brother Branham said they were sayin that Jesus was saying to them why don't you go to now that's your prophet that's where I love the Prophet he's got the answer we've got the questions look Simon Peter answered them Lord answered him Lord to whom shall we go that has the words of eternal life he finally come up with a statement enough to place it would own it and I like the Bible code of that let's see how is it go do you now believe when Jesus got so far he said do you now believe do you understand what I'm getting at what's the first step of salvation God calling you know I cried and prayed they took me to altar I don't even think so that ain't step number one step number one is whether or not if God is calling you yeah but he called everybody mm-hmm remember he chose the twelve and one of them was a devil even had him walking with Him in Judas he chose him to be part of the ministry gave him part of the ministry they cast out devils and all kind of things and that was Judas Iscariot do you remember where you started because that's Romans two and four words the goodness of God is what leads you to repentance it's the goodness of God that leads you to repentance pricked in their heart they became concerned about what they heard well I don't remember being concerned brother Dale oh yes III just I just accepted Jesus cry how can you accept Jesus Christ if you don't know who he is now come on I got it written down here in front of me so if you want it holler just remember you can't run around there with all of those things if it's not God calling you then your coming is great ok good makes you a good neighbor but don't make you a Christian if he's not calling you then you're not in line of salvation that's what I said no we work when he calls everybody brother Dale no we don't and just remember the odd group did he call I mean here was three thousand that was gathered there and he chose three thousand give a message and they accepted it what about it in other words what is the plan of salvation and what does it take to be saved number one it takes the fact of knowing whether God has called you now there's where the good part comes in if he's bragging about Jesus and telling how good he is and what he's done and not telling about how bad he is and how he hates you because you're doing this you're scaring I stood in Jamaica and watched after the I wound up most of you know the story I wound up four priests of her five or six days and nights and I just my voice was gone they would just just totally I couldn't even hardly have whisper and they said what it what do you want us to do I said I want you to put all the kids on the front row it's probably somewhere to 300 people maybe in that building I don't know I said bring all the kids up on the front row I want to talk to them I had an opportunity to jump on to them old folks about their tongues and their gifts and her things that they had scared him with and I started talking to him about the love of God and I told him he even told them flat-out I said your mamas and daddies gonna differ with me about this well I said I got an opportunity to speak to your children I'm gonna speak to you I said I gonna tell you you got to speak in tongues got to do this that any other I said that's their doctrines and ideas but I said all I want to do is talk to you about Jesus Christ I want you to see about this Jesus that I've been preaching about this one that I've been talking of doctrines and ideas all these five sermons or something before I won't talk to you don't want to scare you it won't work I won't talk to you about the love of God and a guy through preaching this order was full the children came to the altar sure next came the people and I had to back up mmm you understand what I mean because they jumped down and tried to get all of them speak in tongues and shouting and do her telling them come on now say it's that say it all those things I had to back up why because I knew I knew better no move any further but I had done what I had set out to do was to try to get those children to think about salvation about Jesus Christ and how they needed a savior I didn't go over there to stir up and create that's why they invited me is that invited if you know the story because a couple of brothers had went over there and they really tore the island up about the message and you got to believe this you got to do that and it's going to Rome or just run it real bad I'm then gonna call her names and the brothers I asked him when I got there asked the pastor I said I know what happened I said I know what the situation took place they know what happened here and what they're doing I said brother branham told us not to do that I said preaching the truth is preaching the truth but now that's deliberately beating on people because they don't believe what you believe it's not it and I said the Prophet told us not to do that I said then I'm here at your point you tell me how far to go and I'll honor your words this is what he said and that's what I done he said the morning services is my people take them to the greatest depth you could take her preach to them whatever is on your heart when he said it not said you gonna be witnessing 300 people from the island and they don't even know what in the world about a prophet or anything like that should be led to say what you say but just don't beat them about it and when I finished I was invited to come back see preaching Jesus Christ is not a bunch of rules and regulations and things to try to get you saved you can stop drinking stop smoking stop chewing stop doing all of those things and still die and go to hell but I just asked you a simple question to where we are what about it have you ever witnessed within your own life a conviction that came upon you - what are you were young or old or whatever you are and you say what I shouldn't do that there were no better than the drinking smoking gambling and stuff like ads you ought to know that that we're not trying to preach you quit all that and then you know you saved no you could ever better that and still be lost I'm just asking you a simple question has God ever dealt with you has he ever come down in the night or something talked to you you ever had a children when God would talk to you and say you need to do that you don't need to do this you don't need to be doing those thing you need to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior cause you see there's your first step it's a no repentance if not no repentance is should be an outward working of an inward point of something taking place that come out right it should be to the point of repentance you know now what was we do to be saved what about it you ever heard the word has it pricked you in your heart ain't talking about today I'm talking about in your life did you come to a knowledge of God because that's what Peter was bringing those people to he had to bring them to a knowledge of Jesus Christ you see why the truth is so important you see why that's so important this message and what we do now come on I know what God has done I got him laying here and I got the scripture where there was a time that God winked at ignorance is right yeah there was a time he winked it to ignorances of the fact that we believed in three gods and taught three gods and and Jesus was this and this was that and that was that and taught all of our doctrines and ideas and things like that and a lot of people come to altar under that but he says now he commands all men to repent what about it have you ever been pricked in your heart have you ever had a conviction to come upon you and be troubled just be troubled in your heart trouble didn't thinking about it that if he's done all of that for me what can I do for him right was that what Peter was explaining all that Jesus had went through and what had taken place and all along and when he did they become pricking me heart and they said men and brethren watching how much we do you brought us out now this far what should we do okay what should we do alright let's go to acts back where we were the number one quote we got down to verse 37 when he's got through explaining what had happened and what Jesus had taken place and how he died and how they had even crucified him when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do well you believe run-around was a prophet you can shout you can cry you can do now what did the Bible say the thing we don't like what is the one word we don't like I'm sorry right did that come out all right what's the very first thing in your life that you don't like to say I'm sorry I was wrong well you really dug this did you what should we do now here is the plan of salvation the first part brings you to what was said it's God calling you not you calling him it's God calling you to salvation all right now once you come to salvation bricked any heart what happened then said then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I'll get to the other part in a minute because that's the worst misunderstood of all things is that little simple point this gets a simple point what it's saying what's the first thing to do in salvation repent repent everyone and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the whole to go it's that scripture also promises under you and your children repent the Bible says that repent what did it repentance and the remission is to priest in the name of Jesus so they said now what can we do they were concerned he said repent what is repent mean Europe means to say I'm sorry or didn't but what does it really mean it means to turn around the mean stop what you do cause you going in the wrong direction right is that a simple understanding of the word repent it means to stop what you're doing turning around and go the other way repentance you remember what you know did people bring you up and talk to you yet you do or did they say to you now what you need to do and here's the basis of what the most most altar calls leads you to is you need to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior all right that's good but that's not starting it what that's not starting it you need to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior you don't you believe that life now that something goes in front of that we just read it what is it you need to repent then ask Jesus to come in no I need I know I prayed for Jesus to come in did you repent first maybe Jesus didn't come in go to remember the thing that we've always been told of what the Prophet says he said it's not whether you accept Jesus Christ it's whether he accepts you now if you don't repent he don't how to accept you are you with me what I rather dare I ask Jesus to come in I went to the altar I cried out I ask him to come into my heart and save me but did you ask him to forgive you of what you've been now coming wedding we're in the future home you know how to repair for what somebody else doing you know how to say God I'm sorry that Adam and Eve mess this thing up in the in the garden and I just got I can't how no per I've got problems but I can't help it now you're a liar come on we'll just come to the altar and accept Jesus Christ as your Savior come to the altar and repent of your sins then you have a right to ask God to forgive you then you have a right to ask him to come in then he's accepting you to come in but he doesn't have to give come in if you don't repent you're trying to get him to come in a dirty house at least we'll get to say a justification where the Prophet said it chops off your pie sins but you see one a lot of people never get nothing they're never been taught what to do I didn't write the book your prophets when it said it so you argued with him he said it's not whether or not you accept him that was a hard one that was a hard one for me cuz I know how that I saw God and not like that back in their denominations and things like that I saw God and when I come to find this message then the man that I claim to believe told me that you never saw God there was him seeking you then I realized hey this thing has been under way a long time he's been trying his best to slow me down long enough to get me straight and the first thing to do to get me straight is what I need to repent well no no you need to accept Jesus Christ if you're listening listen to what I'm saying you can't accept Jesus Christ that away you accept Jesus Christ on the basis that he asking him to forgive you and that he has paid the price who said it Peter Peter what can we do to be saved what you need to do is go get baptized oh we're going we're gonna win long time today but we're gonna get them good with on that now what you need to do is you need to receive the Holy Ghost you ain't even started what about all that 3,000 standing there said what must we do in Jesus looks at him in his head first thing he knew to need to repent now he never stood out there and said what you need to do is accept Jesus Christ he said you need to repent if you ever repented from your sins here's my old faithful statement right I'd rather go through life confessing all of my sins repent of all my sins and coming at the end of the road and find out the Lord doesn't put them under the blood then to not do it at all and wind up the end of the road and I have no hopes what about you brother Dale do you repent every day do you ask God to forgive you every day you must be a dirty guy I am thank you pray for me I don't have no problems I know what straighten what's right do you understand what I'm getting at what is the first thing they heard the message they were pricked in their heart why didn't Peter say all you got to do is believe what he done they already believe what he done they said they did by the fact of them said what can we do well you go join the church you believe God you do this you do that you you accept this you accept that no first thing do is repent now come on children young kids and things come on dolls let's listen but you know people don't teach you you need to repent this is not the age of repentance right this is not the age of repentance nobody wants to repent me you whoever do we want to repent no we're like the guy was it said what said is why said well you ain't told me in 20 years you love me said I told you today I married you I loved you and I ain't changed my mind well God knows 20 years ago I went to Dollar and accepted him as my savior now here's what and you can't tell me I ain't saved because I was dire well where are you now write repentance and remission of sins is in the name of Jesus Christ told you gonna make you simple as again first to realize God called you come on folks you know yourself yours enjoying the world use in right he's enjoying the what early within and you certainly didn't want to repent doing that or stop it you want to keep on doing it but sup didn't come over you colognes Hurst's are we serious enough have you ever been serious enough to just say god I'm sorry just forgive me Lord no I asked you 20 years ago ain't asking him again well don't worry about it accepting Jesus Christ as my savior come on musicians I've accepted Jesus Christ as my savior what else can I do what did brother Branham say on that he said that's a good Baptist point or what else can I do but he said they'll say even look at Abraham and he you know but abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness you know what happened in Abraham received a sign of circumcision the proving his repentance was genuine I prayed I've done praise God so we're supposed to be asking Peter in him who had it received it Peter how did you get this well I spent threatened I've years with the Lord learning the word known Peter how did you get to hold a girl then I first had to realize God was calling me you remember that at least realizing something was calling you something was dealing with you right and then you said well Lord I'm sorry I repented the baptism follows after that but it's not to sign of salvation well yet there's a big portion of people of this world leaving water baptism under regeneration one form or another and I pick that up in the people of this message so we're gonna pick it up in the Bible I love the Bible for it was the truth is kind people say you can't be saved if you're not baptized it's a house the Canadians the Holy Ghost came on them before theirs baptized so now then go on do what you want to I'm in the Bible where you at I'm doctor so-and-so the bleeding yeah okay I'll this stay with the Bible make it simpler Stan well we got really oh there's honey and there's funny and Oh for you realize that God has been leaning leaves your sins for two blood honey what about your repentance now [Music] what about your repentance [Music] god no God I want to do what's right you wanted to tell

it's based on everybody else can have gifts and signs and wonders I just want the word I just want to hear what the word is said and we've already found this much if you don't call us we can't come if
