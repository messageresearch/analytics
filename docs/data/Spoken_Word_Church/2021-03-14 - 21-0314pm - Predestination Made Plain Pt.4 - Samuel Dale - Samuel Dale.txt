and we thank you in jesus name amen ephesians 1 verse 3 blessed be the god and father the word blessed be the god even father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ now remember i made the statement this morning that we're got up we were using abraham we'll still refer back but we're using abraham the old testament people now we're coming into the new testament form so this is this is speaking to me and you now this is bringing it into the bride of christ because watch the scripture according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children now what certain positions certain spots for this last days by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded that were heaped it up pilate on us toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will now in romans uh colossians and timothy you find a mystery there of the engrafting of the gentiles okay but this is not that mystery part this is a great mystery and the prophet says in the adoption series having made known unto us the mystery of his will he said to adopt us all right now that's the mystery of his will so now we're going into that see according to his good pleasure which he has purpose in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time in other words somewhere a dispensation somewhere a predestinated plan somewhere a destiny is set in the fullness of times that he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him you may be seated the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word so now do you understand what we're doing because there is a difference between the old testament salvation and the new testament the old testament salvation was speaking of a time to come sure that it would be jesus christ would come on the scene but as far as the time it could only be made manifest because as we're saying this morning see that jesus christ had not come and died all right until he died you didn't have redemption you had only the blood of bulls and goats speaking of that redemption to come you didn't have the new birth in the old testament they had a promise you know of a coming messiah they had a promise that they could go to uh to the uh regions of the blessed and wait until it would come time for them to come forth you know and some did in the resurrection of the lord jesus and uh but now so just remember what i'm getting at we're coming up now to where we are as i said i just brought that to you where you'd remember it see some people would say well the mystery we know the mystery of misters engrafting to the gentile okay that's right but now that's not this scripture this scripture is not applying to the engrafting of the gentiles all right now listen what i'm saying because that's romans colossians in first timothy that you have a mystery of the engrafting of the gentiles see because there was no promise back there was nothing in the old testament about us we just had little spots like rahab the harlot would speak of it uh you know this would speak of it you could just speak of the coming in of the gentiles because we had no uh connection we were not ours we were not ours we had to be brought into a position to an inheritance or brought into heirs of redemption through the blood of jesus christ all right so then that's you know that's word that we're doing but that's just laying that down where you won't get the thought in your mind it's a mystery well that's that's in gras there is a mystery of the engrafting of the gentiles okay but that's not this scripture this is a scripture of a predestinated predetermined position that someone must reach now i'm putting this out before i start the message part it may take a couple of messages to get through the adoption but that's all right but i'm just making the point to you the word that you'll think about it that this is the adopting into the family and brother brown said that's where the pentecostals even made their mistake he said they come up to the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth and he said they received the new birth but said then they stopped well see then that's why the prophet had to come a predestinated seed was laying in the word as i said this morning a destiny for somebody to reach and it was reached by a prophet in the last days to bring the gentile dispensation to a close all right so now get the difference between the two so that way you want to i do that because maybe some of you may call it well that confuses me well to others it's not confusing because they're they have in their mind their thoughts bless the gentiles being engrafted in no i'll give you the scriptures this is where they are here's where we are this is not the end grafting of the gentiles to see watch what i'm saying this is to where let's read it according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding without blame before him in love having predestinated set a destiny a destiny is set for someone all right having predestinated us unto the prophet said unto he said now like i go into the water fountain i go into the door i go it's something that is a travel emotion has been taking place in travel and it's going to a place but it's going to a position that is destinated for this last days we have a predestinated destiny all right now i want you to take that and just keep it in your mind cause we'll keep probably referring back to it in the next message or two to where we can follow it that we're not just haphazardly see in other words if it had stopped and the prophet had not been sent we would have been to the new birth sure we would have went to glory by passing home but everyone went by the grave right if you understand what i'm getting at this is a predestinated destiny that someone must come to the adoption in coming to the adoption we come to the position of a body change because redemption covers the body as well as the soul so then we're predestinated see unto adoption by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will okay what for now having made known unto us the mystery of his will see we're the only people that knows this mystery you follow me even the pentecostals that come up in line and were lined up and going good and all but still they never reached that right now you understand why the prophet would have to preach over and over the uh uh grain of wheat corn of wheat the things of coming in the promises there and all of those messages would be the christ the mystery of god reveal the which is more than just the end grafting of the gentiles that was taken place back there at calvary because when jesus christ was crucified see then the message was taken out peter went to the gentiles all right that fulfills those scriptures but it didn't fulfill this scripture this scripture comes forth as a predestinated position a destiny for somebody to reach we're in that day and time to where that we could that that can be reached let's see what's got to be who else is going to do it what are we going to do we're going to sit around here and wait another 20 years most of us ain't going to be here you know and what they are is going to be in nursing homes so it may not be a joke that i've always made about it in the minister's meeting fellowship meetings you know i always tell them saying lord don't hurry up and get back we're gonna we're gonna start having fellowship meetings in the nursing homes well you know that's pretty close all right but see somebody has got to to step forth and move into it and know now listen brother branham in referring to gifts and callings that's in my mind i thought in the gifts and callings he brings out moses and he said see thou moses knew the word and i thought oh yeah hey that's him he said moses knew the word see in other words he knew the word for his day because he was living the word he was walking in the word for his day and he knew where he was at he knew where his calling was all he had to depend on the fact of that burning bush to be god you know god in the bush that's all he had to depend on because that would take care of it because the one in the bush said throw down your stick and he throw down his stick it becomes a snake he's take it back up he said with this you're going to take over egypt all right what are you following me now so that we can get a a point and then we'll back out of it and and move back into understanding because see if moses knew the plan all right then he was the man with the word okay now think about that think about that to be coming down here to where that the prophet was sent a predestinated gift i'll cover those in the gifts where the brother around says they're predestinated and he says it's predestinated eternally now it's not the person come on i'll i don't mind quoting the rest of the word because like i'm saying about choosing and you choosing then i i don't mind telling you the rest of the word all right because there has to be a people to make manifest the message that the prophet has brought to this being the prophet coming a predestination that's wonderful god would send us a prophet but there's got to be a people now take that because that's where we stand in the last days not waiting on god to do anything i'm not waiting on him to do it he's doing it right i'm not preaching i've been preaching this message now for 50 years and i've never preached a past tense message i've never preached something of the past you have to tell about the past but i've always preached a future tense or a present tense of the way i like it because there at the burning bush when he said i am that i am that means ever present for eternity in other words why would moses try to even think about being afraid when he had to i am with him he said moses go down there i'm going with you i'm going to take care of it i'm going with you see the day that we're living the time is valuable to us don't worry about these things don't worry about your plagues and your viruses and things like that sure we're human beings hey come on but we're not to just stay that when we're waiting well i've had the virus and i just don't feel too good well start confessing the truth about it that you are healed that'll bring you to a position to move out of that situation you keep talking about how bad it is you just stay there that's the point i'm trying to get you to see somebody's going to reach a position in this day that is predestinated or was predestinated before the world ever begun for a group of people to walk in the last day word the present tense message and say i am that i am he made me that's right if not what are we doing here i mean come on that's like i said i've been here 50 years doing this i've never been down on the basis of wondering what's going on i've always been positive of trying to preach what's going on that's why we never got caught with all of these doctrines and ideas and things because with the same thing of of them coming a warning came to us to say no that's not it right here's the word if moses could have the word why can't you and me how the word after it's been delivered unto us by the prophet we don't have to worry about it it's been delivered unto us step out and take your position and say this is what he's done and to think about that he has come in the last days himself not the prophet not the man he came himself in the last days in the person of jesus christ to walk on this earth i believe that a prophet is god's mouthpiece he is instead of god for me and you he's not in god's stead to take over and do something but he's there to direct us what else would we want why would we be concerned i mean what what's the point and like i said though you keep everything lined up and then you don't have well well we're just mystery he's talking about a mystery we know that the baptist well sure did i did i noted in the baptist that the gentile dispensation had come forth and it was a gentile dispensation from the day of pentecost up because that the gentiles would be coming in and that there was no part back in the old testament about the gentiles to tell you anything about it other than little spots here in yonder of something happening a rahab the harlot or something like that why can't we just well all right to make sure we follow and understand how does god choose that's why we preached that message this morning titled it which is the the predestination made plain number three but really the title of the message was election and calling make sure your calling in election is sure make sure you're in the word don't get caught playing around let's see what is the word the prophet said being in the wrong ranks it's it's a rapture would be no excuse now you answer that one he said being in the wrong ranks at the rapture would be no excuse and now the only way i can do is just read that and just understand what to say it if i'm not ready then there ain't going to be no change of this body for me they may be for you but it ain't going to be for me if i'm not ready so it's my responsibility to make myself available to that and that's making yourself available to the word that's why i spend so much time in trying to bring you to the word and getting you to see things that's like saying about well this is not the reign in the gentile see people's mind gets locked in on those things and they just it just cuts off but see that's not what it is this it's the mystery to have his will which his will is his word and his word is the end time adoption right to adopt his people to become his children is one thing but to adopt it see all right now what was it what did we find then why did god choose the way he has without it being a respecter of person how does he do it all right now he did choose but remember as we studied on the you know the point that many are show many are but fewer chosen many are called but fewer chosen all right so we've got to find ourselves in the word and finding ourselves in the word we wind up talking about then president kent's gospel not something of the past not something in the future but what is taking place right now the only way you'll ever have any faith in the word of god is to have something present tense right well i why why don't we believe it that way now listen what was it about talking about abraham what was it about abraham what was it about mary that we were talking about this morning that made her to be chosen when the world was full of virgins the world was full of young girls capable of fitting into the category of mary but why did he come to mary because he knew by his foreknowledge what she was going to do right right he knew when he contacted her that by his foreknowledge what she was going to do and say now you agree now that's that's holding it all to predestination by foreknowledge he knew what she would do he knew what abraham would do and he knew that abraham would teach his children the prophet said that's a great thing to me he had confidence in abraham he turned around he had so much confidence in moses he said moses go down there he said and don't worry about it so just take that stick and mind me of what i tell you to do when i tell you to throw the stick down you just throw the stick down that's all you got to do you ain't got to do this or that or the other you ain't got to show great signs and wonders and power i'll take care of it and he took over a whole nation because listen i said mary when she said that she said be it unto me according to your word do you realize that's what god wanted somebody to say you realize now come on listen oh you just preached philosophies what are you going to preach it with how many how many young virgins do you think god maybe have dealt with in that day no no no no he he predestined okay now you're getting back to where i'm at so come on he knew before the world ever begun he had already seen it he knew it would take place he knew what would happen with mary and what she would do and when she said be it unto me according to that word that settled within her heart and brother brown said it gave her two wounds virgin two wounds one was her mind now how would you do it when you turn around in and like mary was go home and have to tell joseph which it meant death if he turned her down that's why it was an old man see why it was a married man come on i'm just giving you natural stories of what it is that was the reason it turned out to be that he had to find some man that would accept that not just mary had to find a man that would accept her and it had to be a married man because a young man just wouldn't go along with it sorry to talk like that and god knows my heart and what i'm trying to say but you see he had to accept her jerry had a dream all right but he had to believe the dream what if the devil gave him a dream the next night he had to come to a place to believe that that was god talking to him right that was the case that was the scenario the story whatever you want to call it was for him also to believe it now you can see what i was talking about this morning god choosing that's right he chose you but you must accept what he chose you must accept him in salvation he's not going to make you take it all right what was we talking about what have we been talking about in abraham abraham according to three scriptures romans 4 3 says for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was in it was counted unto him for righteousness that's romans 4 and 3. galatians 3 and 6. even if abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness james 3 and 23 and the scripture was fulfilled which saith the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god wouldn't that be something to be able to think that you're you could say i've got this wonderful friend i'd like to introduce you to who is he it's the lord jesus christ he's my wonderful friend abraham believed god in other words plain language to get it straight he believed god was talking to him amen right when that once appeared to him he believed that one and it's not necessarily there in the first part which is genesis 12. when he appeared to abraham it doesn't talk about him appearing physically maybe he did i don't know i ain't going to argue with you about it because they know we need of it i'm just gonna say it it doesn't say that that god come down in the evening and walked around with him no that's two or three chapters later that he contacts god god contacts abraham and just keeps time after time coming until he finally appears to him in a human form do you understand abraham believed god and it was counted or reckoned or imputed that he was a man of god that he could believe him know and being imputed unto him he could wind up being the friend of god what a wonderful position that you could spend months preaching on that very thing but get what i'm talking about now why was it that abraham was accepted is because that he believed god you say well i believe the lord well you know what now here's where maybe it's going to come down into us real hard see we prove what we believe right we prove whether we believe or not now you tell me i believe this message but yet you do like the people of this message are doing and acting and things and saying brother branham was wrong here and wrong here and this that and the other and then you tell me they believe god i'm going to tell you you're a liar i'm going to tell you you don't believe it and god knows whether we believe him or not right are you pulling anything over on him to be able to say lord i believe you now lord you know you know me now lord you know i believed you but think about it god came to abraham's believing all right that's the point i've made for three services coming into four now abraham done something that got god's attention and what was it he believed god not just believing in a god not just accepting that there is a god that's not salvation salvation is not because you're doing it salvation is when you believe it to the point that the person of jesus christ comes and lives in you in the new birth then you can say you believe him see no wonder faith is the substance of things hoped for because that's what abraham had for his day it was like who was it the other night was bringing it out uh the word brother louise i guess somebody where the word faith is only two times in the old testament two hundred and something in the new because it's not an old testament word the best you can do with the old testament wording would come out to be faith in god it is not a new testament it's not used there as it is in the new testament that turned out to be the faith of god abraham had faith in god it didn't give him a new birth never gave him eternal life but it was a human man that's what i want you to see that's what i've always tried to preach about abraham that he was a man yet he was a band that god come in contact with and god used him and typed with him and showed this and that and the other and bringing it all the way through until he was called a friend of god david it says he was a man after god's own heart you say look how bad david was but yet look how wonderful he was as far as god was looking at god could tell him to go do something he'd do it he just directed him to do it he'd go do it it didn't make no difference sure he was a rascal or everything in the book but he believed god he said that giant that little wimp and y'all afraid of it then i tackled a bear i tackled a a lion and said you mean to tell me that you're afraid of that he said whatever it was that took care of me in the situation will take care of me now get out of the way don't give me none of your armor don't give me none of your goodies don't give me none of your gifts none of your doings none of all the things you could come up with just let me go myself he took care of it he went up there and told that giant he said today i'll cut your head off probably had a little small knife you know maybe he had a little small knife where'd he get the sword to cut off the giant's head from the giant all he had to do is get him on the ground and he run and took his sword from him and oh that was easy to do probably hard to pick up but once he dropped it off went ahead see he wasn't afraid you know i believe sometimes that a lot of people just get just enough salvation to get to where they were maybe a little bit and stop being afraid just a little bit but they're still afraid afraid of these viruses and things i've tried my best to tell you i told you to start with you when it started this is not the tribulation this is pre-tribulation tribulation is the wrath of god it's not just these small things uh talking to brother ernie villanueva last night or yesterday and he said they was not able to go to church up there they were kind of like the way we done it said they they had the speaker the uh music the song leader and they could have the like track people keep up you know and stuff like that that what you would call it he said that's all they can go to church so you know what they're doing they're driving over into the united states because they bought that camp thing and you know they they own some kind of big camp area they got they're going to church there well that's a good smart thing to do you know what i mean it's like he was saying he said sam it's here it's done yeah they can do anything they want to they can go down there at the border right now and tell them they can't cross that and go over there if you go over there you're going to stay over there for 14 days or something that can be done but are we afraid of that we're not foolish never have believed it i was too foolish maybe a little stupid but not too foolish because i've always thought and believed in god that could take care of us okay so what happened god found him a man that would believe him but you know what god had it over on abraham you know why because god had already seen abraham right god had already seen abraham accept what he was doing and do the thing so he's just waiting on the man that's all he's doing with me and you that's right he's just waiting on us to step up right see the bride has got to realize who she is and that's what the prophet said is that when she does that she will be an invincible army when she believes who she is satan will be powerless the prophet said before us yeah but i just don't believe that well see that's what don't worry about it you're not going to be one of the chosen to stay here now i'm saying this the way i want it you're not going to be them that lies to the liest we're going to go by the grave if we don't have enough faith to be able to stand on the word of god and believe who we are and what we're doing we're going by the grave you think i have any trouble saying what i've taught you 40 or something years ago that i believe god showed me then that the biggest portion of the people of this message born-again believers i had no references and the reference was not to the basis of them not being the reference was of the people of the message would have to go by the grave because they cannot stand on the faith well i don't like you talking like that cause you're talking about my wife husband kids this die i'm not talking about them i'm telling the truth wherever one's going to die god don't do something in a hurry right come on i'm 80 years old what are you maybe we're like we used to be you know we talked about it after wednesday night i guess it was tony and a bunch of us were talking uh you know we used to when you had an old car and it got 50 000 miles on it you wouldn't got rid of it right some of you ain't old enough to remember that i'm well old enough to know that when you got 50 000 miles on a car you got rid of it because it was getting old it was worn out now you've got 500 000 miles on your car and it's still running what happened somebody just got smart enough to say well hey i got fifty thousand i'll just drive this to 50 55 anyway i'll drive to 60 000. you get up to 60 say well i might as well just keep driving it for a while first thing you know you got a hundred thousand miles well let's keep driving for a while right well why can't we get in the same way with god on the basis that we can finally get to word that we can believe what he said about us now you have to admit when he says the bride that he's talking about the bride amen see just like i was talking about i believe i believe my thoughts was correct the bride of christ the biggest portion of is going to die and go by the grave why because they can't stand here and stand on their own two feet in the message and believe it so where else are we going come on where are we going to okay let's go was it not that abraham believed god and god looking at what abraham believed in him and he foreknew all about it anyway and he knowed what he would do but he wanted abraham to find out so he put him through tests and trials right he puts you and me through tests and trials to see what we'll do not what he know he already knows what we're going to do i just don't know what i'm going to do that's what i told the man at work down there he's thrown off on me about the message and believing in god and everything and was working across each other and he looked over me he said i want to just come over there and whoop you i said well if that's what you want to do you know i said but i'll remind you of one thing i try to be a christian but you don't know what you're doing coming over here and i don't know what i'm going to do when you get over here you know what he didn't get over there he turned around went back down the line working i was just being honest i don't know what i'd have done i hope i'd had enough grace to took a slap in the face and i've had that i always wondered what that'd take and the man one day down there at work slapped me just man did he knock me almost down and i just turned around and looked at him i just stood there and looked at him had about a half grin on my face because i was thinking something else holding on it's going to ain't me i wasn't afraid of him no more than being afraid of a 10 year old kid but i was just standing there grinning he just turned off and went on back down to his job and we worked pretty close together he didn't come up from where i was at for quite a while maybe 10 15 minutes he come up here and he said i shouldn't have done what i've done while ago i said it's all right see it proved the point it proves something can keep you if you'll let it and it'll turn out to be your end that guy was a best friend of mine from then on he was you know but listen church abraham believed god that was what got god's attention mary believed god go all the way through the bible with the warriors of faith now that they'd believe god sure it may be a david like i said that david knew he wasn't going to die until he sat on that throne because he would anoint it to be king he knew that it may be that way but there's a predestinated position for every one of us right see you say yeah but you know predestination i'm glad brother around said that he said now god didn't just put you in a pot and push you through the other end and said you overcome see he leaves you as to choose and to walk in your part but he wants you to choose he wants you to accept the point and walk in it are you following me so maybe one of these days we'll realize what happened in our christian experience that it'll click with us and we'll say he was there all the time waiting patiently in line i like that song or time wherever it goes there he's been waiting on me and you brother branham said it like that he said i forgot what he used on the end of it but he said if god can get one man in his hands he had one man in moses right he had one man in david he said if he can get one man i forgot how he said it maybe maybe it was if we could get one man in line he said the rapture would take place or something there's something on the end of it would be a marvelous thing that if he could just get one man well okay i'm reading this lord so evidently i ain't the one you know and i don't use excuses well you know i could have no no no no no no i face it just up front that's just the way i face things straight up front whatever god says about me and you why don't we believe it good or bad because even the bad can you can turn away from that and go back to the good things can be changed to where they're disdifferent that's why the predestination is not a stamped thing it is on one basis he back there saw it he stamped it there he didn't come down here and stamped here he saw you and me before we ever for the world ever begun sitting in church today if you don't think about god that way what kind of a god do you have a flim-flamed wednesday some kind of a situation could it be that what caused god to look at abraham he finally found somebody that had just a little bit of a love in his heart for him you don't think like that you don't think about the situation see i think about what could be without doing it that's where wade was telling him about that story that i told him and and i was just preaching on predestination and what i was talking about was as a girl like gilsen she was a methodist and you know i told the story about it i said i could have married her and wound up being a methodist preacher you just laugh at it i know because you don't understand what i'm talking about because you're thinking nothing can't happen that way i'm saying we do have a choice how long do you want to stand here and quote what the brother the prophet said you had a choice in who you married you had a choice in where you work you got a choice in this you got a choice in that that's right that's why i've always told my wife you'd have been better off if you chose one of them other guys i don't think my brother but that's right she used to date him a little bit but that was okay but all right listen now get to the point in romans what did i do yeah romans 4 and 3 it talks about abraham believed god and you know what his believing was counted unto him for righteousness the definition of the word righteousness or no comes from the word right you know and so right is something that's right and then you bring on to other ways through science i mean through the wording to bring it up but it's counted unto him for the right act or being right galatians says even as abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness james 3 and 23 three times god uses the phrase and let me quote the prophet if god repeats something you listen when it says verily verily i say unto thee he said listen to what's being said when he repeats himself he's got a reason three times he said abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness well could that be the very thing that god was looking at now remember he didn't have to do it down here he done it back there in his mind before the world he saw abraham and doing what abraham was doing down there when he come to that believing that walking out was a manifestation that was just like jesus stood as a lamb slain back there but you couldn't put that to the point of bringing no great things until he came to calvary and died then could come into manifestation a savior a healer a deliverer all right god's just waiting on you and me just to step out on his word and then let him step out amen okay so think on these things all right now getting to the message today he predestinated us having predestinated us unto the adoption of children all right now i'll read some of these in a minute but you know the story of adoption you've been around the message long enough to have heard it your adoption is not your new birth you've got to get into the family because in the old testament adoptional form it was the fact that the son you know was all a son from the time he was born into the family because he was born a dale he didn't become one he was born to dale he was born to that farmer or that person all right and see being born to that person he was a member of the family with inherit rights of everybody in the family okay but if that child as we'll really have time to get into some of it if that child behaved correctly then he could come to the adoptional point you know what that word bar vitsu and what it is what it talks about i can't never pronounce it correct we were able while we were there in israel uh i assume that's what they were doing because they were like a a bunch of them gathered at one place and and they was coming down and they was going through ceremonies and and taking of bread and doing things you know and and i think that was probably what we were viewing was that person out in the public to be declared to be a child of god you know all right but now think about it you're predestinated unto which means you're going from here to there which means a traveling journey unto all right it's not the position for you to sit down and become a nonchalant and that's what your adoptional form is covered in right if the child was acting like the father then it would finally come to where that the son could be adopted now i don't mean this wrong because i didn't write the book but uh i've never found an adoption for the girl the women right it always talks about a son i don't understand that i understand one time i believe in the new testament you take from the old testament it would be a son but i believe in the new testament is sons and daughters okay ladies i'm on your side i believe that you've got to be adopted too you i believe you've got to do it as well as your husband it's not your husband to do it for you you got to be that yourself i am not my wife's savior i can't perform as that or act as that she has to have her own faith her own baptism of the holy ghost but see in the old testament it was brought into a family as like a type the child born into the family would be a type of the baptism of the holy ghost to you in the new testament situation all right and that child if that child lived and done correctly he was taken out and finally adopted and given the position to where he could sign the check he could do anything he was just as much as in charge as the daddy was and correctly speaking but if random and bringing it we'll get to these things and do it really it's to the point that what he was saying this is my beloved son whom i'm pleased to dwell hear ye him he said god was simply saying i'm stepping back if you hear anything you're going to hear him the brother brandon preached a lot of messages called hear ye him i invite you to challenge me on it to see it a lot of that was not to adoptional situations in other words he wasn't explaining adoption as much as he was explaining the straight truth hear ye him you're god hear the word no matter where it's coming from no matter who the speaker is it's the word of god it's the word of god just as real as any word of god that he had written you know hand wrote himself you follow me see i'm on the side with sisters too huh oh but listen he predestinated a people unto adoption now that this as i said this morning and bring it back now that see this is a this is a present tense gospel it would have to be put somewhere in the bible the word that you could read it as being the finality you know the answer to all things and the statue of a perfect man is that so you add to your faith which is a born-again experience you add virtual knowledge what as you receive the word as it's being revealed to you you're growing up the stature of a perfect man we'll cover that but the point i want you to see about it is it's predestinated unto it's a journey and see you started the journey your journey as a christian started with the baptism of the holy ghost come on right now you started with the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth that was your start of your journey all right justification is just a work of the holy spirit sanctification is a work of the holy spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit right all right so you started your journey in a new birth it brought you into the family of god gave you eternal life in your soul making your soul redeemed making you a son or daughter of god all right well see that's just the start of the journey because that's a baby every born and again believer starts their journey as a baby you don't start your journey as full-grown where would you find your types and things for it you start your journey it's the day you're born again that puts you in the body of christ but you're a baby desiring the sincere miracle of the word as the bible said that you may grow there by and being born again by the incorruptible word the statue of a perfect man can't be built by how much knowledge here is not just how much you can learn the message it's holy ghost knowledge it's the reveal word of god it's god's word revealed to you all right it puts you to a place to where that new birth just puts you in the body and there's where brother brown says your pentecostals messed up because you see he covered he said that justification had its time sanctification had its time in other words a predestinated seed a destiny luther destiny was the just shall live by faith protest the catholic church get out of there and leave that stuff alone that was his day a destiny he reached his destiny he had to go on then he had to go on by the grave wesley come along he done his part he sent the missionaries to the world and and the writings of the books and the things and on the bible and the songs and and things but that didn't finish it long come the baptism of the holy ghost on azusa street the prophet said that's where you made your mistake thinking that you got everything when you was born again he said when you didn't he said you just started come on take the natural story and see it with a spiritual you start your natural life as a baby right goo goo again all kind of things right but one day your journey has to complete in the basis of a growth development the baby has to grow up he said then we'll quit our little petey pattern and i've got to hear one i know i ain't going to get it today so i'll just use the parts of these notes and preach on it later i don't worry about it but see that child has to learn to walk right well you know what's the best thing about a child learning to walk i mean you don't want to hurt him and you don't don't go wrong with me just listen but you take him and you just stand him up against the wall you give him something to kind of get sturdy about on his back and then you walk away from him and say come on well now he's gonna fall right but you know in doing all that he's going to learn to walk then after they learn to walk you want them to sit down and shut up you know right you want them to learn to talk come on dad dad dad my mama come on come on come on and then they'll finally get to an end and be like i was one day coming road driving from all the way in atlanta and my brother-in-law was in the car with me and he had his boy with him and he was just a little small like fella and all the way up the road he said the same time over and over and over every mile that i went by it was over and over i wanted to spank him i'm sorry i wanted to at least tell him to shut up you know but he was growing up he finally learned to say some other things maybe that's why god sometimes spanks that's pretty good you know with kids crying you know and what do we tell the kids you tell them they fall down and then get up and go come on that didn't hurt well you know after a while that kind of gets in that kid's mind he said i felt i didn't hurt he gets something goes see he learns and that's what a child of god has to do we'll read these things as we go along and just bring some more about it but see you're predestinated i want you to get the point you're predestinated to a certain position zeus street was pentecostal predestinated a position of the new birth and your prophet said they turned it down well see somebody has got to go beyond the new birth somebody has got to go to a position i know you don't like it because i know what people think when you say anything think you're exalted or whatever but i've told you enough that you ought to know that at least i've done it but in 1969 in athens georgia i preached a message called the bride of jesus christ would be the son of man the fullness of the godhead bodily 1969 when others were dealing with whether brother branham was wrong i hear about this dates and that was this they was doing that back in the 70s we had ministers meetings about those things but it's like i told you back in that day you had enough old people to stand up and they stood firmly on the bases it didn't matter what everybody was talking about dates and times and seasons we had ministers meetings on the little thing in our colorado and what it was about to date so going up in the sky in the cloud and the thing like and i told them then i said you're denying the god that the prophet is the is the prophet of god for the age you're denying what he says you're just not arguing over dates and times you're trying to prove him wrong because if you can prove him wrong you're going to disbelieve him well you can see that back there i wasn't popular either so that's why i'm not popular now because i stand on one thing it's this message or nothing we're either going up or we're going down we got our choice let's take our choice our stand you know god might decide to look down and say hey them people's doing just what i want them to do and you know when he does he's going to move on the scene with a pity padded little baby you know no that's not what he wants he wants his bride to stand forth and be men and women of the gospel like i said you may not even think it means a thing in the world but see i like that kind of a doing to worry that i can say hey look this is not this scripture here is not the engrafting of the gentiles because they don't even mention them in ephesians you know in this scripture ephesians 1. so i give you the scripture that says hey here's the other scriptures about the gentiles you think well what does that mean to me someday somebody will come up to you and say something and you'll say ephesians 1 is not the engrafting of the gentiles and you're going to blow their brain because they've been taught of engrafting and they taught it as a whole thing it's not engrafting gets in you to the body of christ come on in grafting just puts you in the body of christ that don't put you to adoption growth development of a child eating and and drinking milk and and all i got it's what causes a child to grow up in the gospel by eating the word of god week in week out day in and day out hearing the same thing well brother dale you said that five times this week if we're gonna have five more services i'd say it five or ten more times why because one thing repetitive points is going to put it in your mind and you may need it someday because i believe somebody is going to come to a place to call god on the scene i believe he's going to come because of what they've done with the word he come to abraham because abraham believed him what about me and you but you see one thing in ending it whatever we he saw of us back there before the world is what we're going to do now there's no way for him back there to see you as a saved person and then see you come over here in reality find out and join a church and go to church and cry and please and get saved because you're not going to do it because he doesn't see you ain't going to do it he's seen that something wrong will be something wrong with you and you're not going to do it so we better be praying for god to try to match our predestination with our foreknowledge and to cry out before him and say lord whatever i was back there i am that now let me go that away amen you can't change your predestination do you understand the man that was at it 15 years he never trained it he died the prophet told him you're going to die he begged for god and god gave him 15 years god didn't change his mind he died in 15 years he'd have been better off though if he'd have died right there because he messed up in his 15 years that he was left you see we crying praying and you know and doing our little baby ways but brother dale i know when i was there i was there when i received the holy ghost because i shouted and spoke in tongues and and i done this and i done that i saw dreams i had visions amen for all of us but what about the word are you going to turn the word down see that's what god would see you do before the world he'd see you crying and praying and everything but you see you turn down the word of the hour you realize what these brothers are doing now when they're killing these the people of the message by their self-interpretations of all of the things they are destroying the people's opportunity be careful what you hear don't let it become a part of you don't let it become a part of you because it's hard to get rid of the hardest thing to get rid of is a false doctrine because you're going to do everything that you can that's why i always say i don't have to worry about you if you'll spend as much time trying to prove that what i've said to you is right if you do spend that much time trying to prove that i'm wrong if you'll try to prove that i'm right you'll see what i'm talking about so it's left into your life a predestinated plan a destiny is set for a group of people to reach an adoption opposition to where that she can come to romans 8. we'll get over to our right you remember in romans 8 what it does it comes down to wit to understand to wit the redemption of the body to understand the redemption of the body and what it takes to be there that was your adoption yeah but do i have to know everything not they you don't have to know everything i know and i don't mean that wrong because i believe you know more than i do because you can you can study on whatever you want to you can listen to any tape you want to i listened to my wife we'll do something we'll be there and maybe sometimes two or three tapes run right through listening i ain't saying that i'm about to mourn her more than me i'm just saying the point one of us might be sitting there of eating and and filling up on the word of god for whatever we have another and the other one's sitting there listening a good message right make your calling and say this morning calling an election sure come on musician make your calling an election sure make sure that you know what it is to be called make sure you know what it is to be elected but just remember all of that is covered under one thing if you'll remember the foreknowledge of god the foreknowledge of god he knew before the world what all of us would do and we're not going to change it you say well ain't no need of me trying then well he saw that if you say well is there any hopes of me changing my life and becoming a christian yeah if you'll do what god says well that's changing his mind no it didn't he knew he was going to change he knew he was going to come to a place that's what i've been talking about he knew you'd come to a place to want to be saved so he'll have it for you i don't see how anything of salvation could be any more simple than to understand that god before the world ever begun saw what we would do and he had it waiting on us when we got here how much more simple can you do that unless stan what we got brother that that sounds like home to me think on these things that sounds like home to me [Music] like where i want to be there'll be no tears [Music] the hills will let go with the story as we sing of his grace and glory where the saints of god will be that sounds like home to me that sounds like home to me right
