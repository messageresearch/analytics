[4:38] the field
[4:39] the fields out there and
[4:42] so for any of you that are at home
[4:44] please
[4:45] try to listen somewhere somehow
[4:49] get something until we can pray that
[4:52] this thing be over with i
[4:54] i we we never questioned god
[4:59] job in all of his we've not one person
[5:02] in this room come
[5:03] close to what he went through not one
[5:06] person
[5:07] and i said not even close to what he
[5:10] went through
[5:12] and he never he never
[5:15] blamed somebody else he he just went
[5:18] through it and he
[5:19] come out on the other side and you know
[5:21] what that's why god brought his
[5:23] attention to
[5:24] the devil because he knew that job would
[5:26] be an everlasting example
[5:30] for even now 4 000 years ago job lived
[5:33] or longer
[5:34] okay in one of the oldest books of the
[5:36] bible that was written
[5:37] here's job and we're still talking about
[5:39] him and marveling that he can stand up
[5:41] in the midst of boils all over his body
[5:43] his wife turning against him
[5:45] all of his children dead
[5:49] millionaire in this age would he he
[5:52] would be
[5:53] and he had to sit on a nice sheep and
[5:55] listen to three of his friends complain
[5:57] about why he was
[5:58] why he was the way he was he was some
[6:00] kind of secret center or some kind of
[6:01] joke and you really done something have
[6:03] you really not cleaned your closet out
[6:04] lately you know
[6:06] but thank god for elihue that fourth man
[6:09] in the fire when he came
[6:11] when elihu came he said job stand right
[6:13] where you're at
[6:14] be quiet and listen to what i got to say
[6:16] and we know who that is that was christ
[6:19] through that gentleman talking to him
[6:20] said he was he was a young man and he
[6:22] spoke to job i just got finished reading
[6:24] the book of job and it's really
[6:26] uh you ought to go back and read it
[6:27] again with us going through the things
[6:29] that we've went through
[6:30] um here and we lost a pretty good friend
[6:34] uh close to us from gainesville that was
[6:36] june used to keep his kids
[6:37] he passed away today he's younger than
[6:39] me um
[6:40] with uh covid 19. it was tony hamilton
[6:44] he knew uh
[6:45] he went to school with debbie
[6:48] at north hall so so he um
[6:52] a christian man as far as nominal
[6:53] christian goes and a very good singer
[6:56] so he passed away today from this nasty
[6:59] virus
[7:00] so uh god bless you we still think we
[7:03] still don't think we know god's got a
[7:04] hedge around us
[7:07] god's only gonna allow things to happen
[7:09] i i'm still bringing this quote again
[7:10] from shalom where brother brown says
[7:12] when you've done all you can do
[7:14] just keep on waiting when you've done
[7:17] all you can do to stand
[7:18] then stand just stand
[7:22] how can i keep going on stand
[7:26] how am i gonna do it stand
[7:30] because listen if we can't believe in
[7:31] god in this hour
[7:34] who in the world are we going to believe
[7:35] in doctors don't know they got all kind
[7:38] of this and they got all kind of this
[7:40] it's like a ping pong ball this thing is
[7:42] and nobody's got any answer direct
[7:44] answer
[7:45] of what to do but we know one there's a
[7:48] bomb in gilead
[7:50] and that bomb something in that bomb
[7:53] that when you apply it you get better
[7:57] so thank god for that that we can look
[7:59] at that bomb in gilead you don't have to
[8:00] go to walmart and get it you don't have
[8:02] to go to no pharmacy to get it
[8:04] the only prescription you have is the
[8:06] gospel
[8:08] all right this is all you got right here
[8:10] and i think we're since we're coming
[8:12] down to the end time you know i think
[8:13] we're narrow this thing's narrowing down
[8:17] all the things we thought we couldn't do
[8:18] without
[8:20] we can do without so god
[8:24] i think god's preparing us and showing
[8:26] us
[8:27] that this is like brother dale said this
[8:29] may not be the
[8:30] uh the this isn't definitely not the
[8:32] squeeze come on people good grief
[8:35] i'm still driving when going to going to
[8:38] out and eat and no
[8:42] brother brown said physically bereft
[8:44] that's a little bit different
[8:46] uh sitting in line at drive through at
[8:48] mcdonald's for 15 minutes is not
[8:49] physically breath
[8:50] that's just real slow service okay i had
[8:54] to do that today so i just reminded
[8:55] everybody that
[8:57] but but when we look at these things but
[8:59] i i want to warn you
[9:01] uh brother dale's got a i want him here
[9:03] sunday because he says he's got a good
[9:05] sermon
[9:06] to give for all this that's going on so
[9:08] we we pray that he's had plenty of time
[9:10] to study
[9:11] so so he he may just uh we might have to
[9:14] get out of the way he may park the water
[9:16] and
[9:16] take us to the promised land uh but um
[9:20] but there is there is something for us
[9:21] to look at but please don't try to put
[9:24] i i and we are put we're canning stuff
[9:26] and we're putting stuff
[9:27] up because the food chain may go out you
[9:31] never know
[9:32] but there's a there's a guy that that um
[9:35] he's a friend of ours
[9:37] and and i think from listening to him i
[9:39] don't want you get caught up in this
[9:41] he's trying to figure out if he don't
[9:45] make the rapture
[9:47] he's going to make it through that
[9:48] tribulation period
[9:51] no no
[9:55] i don't put any hope on making it
[9:57] through the tribulation period
[9:59] i won't i'm getting out of here that my
[10:02] and i don't even have a hope you have an
[10:04] assurity when you have the baptism of
[10:05] the holy ghost you have an assurity
[10:07] that you will not go through the
[10:08] tribulation what a great thing i don't
[10:10] have a
[10:11] i don't have a backup or a second plan
[10:14] or uh maybe if i put enough gold up or
[10:17] maybe if i
[10:18] you know grow enough asparagus or
[10:20] whatever you know just saying that
[10:22] if you like asparagus that's fine i hate
[10:24] it but um
[10:26] it keeps from it reminds me of the the
[10:28] asparagus on uh
[10:29] veggietale so i just can't eat anything
[10:31] hardly i see them vegetable
[10:33] so it's like eating bob and all them
[10:35] people so anyway
[10:36] a little john knows one's on that don't
[10:38] you because you grew up on that didn't
[10:39] you so do my kids
[10:40] but um but just don't try to
[10:45] like brother brown said if you knew god
[10:46] was coming tomorrow now listen how
[10:47] profound this is
[10:49] if you knew god was coming tomorrow
[10:53] he said and you were planting potatoes
[10:56] he said go ahead and plant those
[10:59] now to me that's profound if you knew
[11:04] so what's he telling us to do be
[11:07] diligent
[11:07] press even up to the door of the moment
[11:11] christians will be diligent christians
[11:14] will not be
[11:15] high we might have to physically hide
[11:16] from somebody who knows but i'm not
[11:18] talking about
[11:19] us having to try to get around something
[11:23] or get away with something no
[11:26] no it's going to take everything you got
[11:28] to get us out of here everything you've
[11:29] got in here
[11:30] to get us out of here so god bless you
[11:32] we're going to talk about the feast of
[11:33] the lord we're going to review
[11:35] and then we're going to talk about the
[11:36] three great feasts that all
[11:38] males were required in israel to attend
[11:42] three of these seven feasts and they
[11:45] have a significance
[11:46] if we can get to them so god bless you
[11:50] pray for everybody it's a long list i
[11:52] start at night and
[11:53] i start with sister jill because that's
[11:55] the first thing i feel when i roll over
[11:57] in the bed i feel that and i start
[11:59] praying for sister jail then i pray for
[12:01] mom then i pray for dad
[12:03] brother donny brother ron spencer
[12:06] brother ron
[12:07] peterson i just keep going down the list
[12:09] and man it's getting long
[12:10] so we need to remember these people
[12:13] in our prayers we still need each other
[12:15] more than anything
[12:17] amen all right reach out to somebody
[12:20] hey look reach out to somebody if god
[12:23] put somebody on your heart
[12:25] send them a text send them an email call
[12:28] them on the phone
[12:30] do something if somebody's put on your
[12:31] heart just go ahead and go ahead and
[12:33] make that say hey how you doing
[12:35] maybe going through a rough time you
[12:36] know or maybe not maybe just want to say
[12:39] hey
[12:40] brother chris long said to tell
[12:41] everybody hey i talked to him yesterday
[12:42] he was calling to see how mom was
[12:44] and they're doing okay out there it's
[12:45] hitting the indian reservations really
[12:47] bad
[12:48] out there but it's not hitting them uh
[12:50] hardly at all
[12:51] so um uh just remember people like
[12:55] uh poor brother uh daryl ward he i think
[12:58] it was like 17 days
[13:00] that he was still having it he was
[13:02] coming out he was on the 18th day when
[13:04] brother chris talked to him but
[13:05] he said for 17 days he said i've sit in
[13:07] my house
[13:09] and been bothered by this thing 17
[13:12] days so god bless you
[13:17] if you don't have it pray to god you
[13:18] don't get it
[13:20] all right let's go to the book of exodus
[13:21] 23 and this will be the three times the
[13:24] feast are in the year and then we're
[13:26] going to
[13:27] review all seven if that's all right and
[13:30] then we'll
[13:32] uh i think we're going to just to kind
[13:35] of
[13:36] tweak your interest we may uh
[13:39] we may uh either go back and do the uh
[13:44] timeline that we did many years ago
[13:45] about adam to the future home and
[13:48] we may do that or we may tell brother
[13:51] joe you know a lot of times our
[13:54] our sermon titles when you put some kind
[13:58] of mysterious something in the sermon
[14:00] title and then it's on youtube you get
[14:01] immediately you get 20 or 30
[14:03] more hits so we might speak on the trail
[14:06] of the serpent guess how many that might
[14:08] get
[14:10] but we know one thing's for sure satan's
[14:14] still here
[14:16] but we know who he is and we're learning
[14:18] more of his tactics every day
[14:20] we know what that trail is we just got
[14:22] to be careful and not get on the same
[14:24] trail he does
[14:25] like that on god of the evil god of this
[14:26] evil ages brother bob that kind of what
[14:28] struck my mind is
[14:30] is there's people literally worshiping
[14:32] jesus christ today and worshiping the
[14:34] devil
[14:36] not the not the people out there with
[14:38] the with the what is it the six point
[14:40] star
[14:40] or whatever the the devil symbol is and
[14:42] all no that's not them they're
[14:44] they're uh god of this evil ages right
[14:47] here
[14:49] that trail runs right through every
[14:51] church every person you just got to
[14:53] remember
[14:54] and realize who he is and what he's up
[14:58] to
[14:58] and that's what the seals do it exposes
[15:00] the devil because it tells me of
[15:02] redemption as it as it tells me of
[15:04] redemption it exposes the devil and
[15:06] where does he go
[15:07] here stands a lamb and there goes the
[15:09] white horse rider that's what i want to
[15:10] see
[15:11] i want to see the tail end of the devil
[15:14] you know what that means he's going away
[15:16] from you
[15:18] amen resist the devil and he'll flee
[15:20] from you that's the greatest seal there
[15:21] ever
[15:22] there ever was you know resist the devil
[15:24] and he'll flee from you
[15:25] there's not a formula there's not ad
[15:28] this and that no
[15:29] just resist him just say no not today
[15:32] devil not today
[15:34] so let's bow our heads and pray before
[15:35] we get started dear lord
[15:38] thank you for the time that you've given
[15:39] us to be on this earth
[15:43] for whatever heartache and trial for
[15:45] whatever tribulation for whatever
[15:47] happiness for whatever
[15:48] joy for what everything lord we've been
[15:50] given
[15:52] lord we stand here today as a 60 year
[15:54] old man that's been through a
[15:56] long life some of it has been sorry
[16:00] but lord some of it's been filled with
[16:02] joy
[16:03] lord especially that that night that you
[16:05] gave me the baptism of the holy ghost
[16:08] lord what a joy that's been from now on
[16:10] now the trials and struggles have been
[16:12] real and the same
[16:14] but we've just been able to handle them
[16:15] lord and i pray each individual will
[16:17] look back on their life and realize
[16:18] where they did come from
[16:20] look at that journey that they were on
[16:23] and that they're still in
[16:24] now and how this is going to take us to
[16:27] a future home father
[16:28] we pray that you'd be with us now take
[16:30] care of the ones that are sick
[16:32] we pray that all these test results will
[16:33] come back negative
[16:35] and we pray that the light will shine in
[16:36] the dark place
[16:38] and lord we know it's you lord that's
[16:40] doing all this you are in complete
[16:42] control
[16:43] you're just allowing the devil to do
[16:44] things lord but we know you are the one
[16:47] that we turn to lord
[16:48] for everything we need father give us
[16:51] this day our daily bread
[16:52] be with us now and take care of us bless
[16:54] all the other churches lord that's
[16:55] getting hit by this thing lord there's a
[16:57] purpose behind it
[16:58] sometimes we don't know it but lord you
[17:00] gave us resolve
[17:02] and a resilience through your word it
[17:04] tells us that there's no weapon formed
[17:07] nothing can come from wherever we say
[17:09] china wherever they say it comes from
[17:12] there's no weapon that's formed that's
[17:14] going to harm us
[17:16] and lord we realize that now because we
[17:19] know that we are covered by your blood
[17:22] lord be with our pastor keep him safe
[17:24] lord
[17:25] bless your mom lord and take care of
[17:26] each one each family lord has been
[17:28] touched by any of this
[17:29] we pray that you just give us strength
[17:31] in jesus name we pray
[17:33] amen that's what we need we need
[17:35] strength
[17:37] so here we are now at the end of the
[17:39] feast
[17:40] we're coming to the end of the feast but
[17:42] there was three times a year
[17:44] that all males in israel were required
[17:48] to come to
[17:50] all right not everybody but
[17:53] all males all right so exodus 23 verse
[17:57] 14 says three times thou shalt keep a
[17:59] feast unto me
[18:01] in the year thou shalt keep the feast of
[18:04] unleavened bread now remember here
[18:05] you're going to see this
[18:06] it says unleavened bread remember
[18:09] passover is connected to that
[18:12] because i'm going to read you another
[18:13] scripture and it seems like
[18:15] that it might be a little different but
[18:16] it's not feast of unleavened bread
[18:18] thou shall eat unleavened bread seven
[18:20] days as i commanded then the time
[18:22] appointed of the month of bib
[18:23] or nissen first month for in it thou
[18:27] camest out from egypt and none shall
[18:29] appear before me
[18:30] empty now there's your key and the feast
[18:33] of harvest
[18:34] the first fruits of the labor now you
[18:36] say oh no that's the first fruit no it's
[18:37] not feast the first fruit
[18:40] that's feast of the harvest remember the
[18:42] feast of first fruit
[18:44] was when the first part came to maturity
[18:48] and the priest waved it but then there
[18:50] was a harvest
[18:53] in the feast of weeks or the feast of
[18:55] pentecost
[18:56] which was the wheat harvest because
[18:58] we're going to see here in a minute
[18:59] that'll prove it it doesn't contradict
[19:01] itself and the feast of harvest
[19:04] the first fruits of thy labors which
[19:06] thou has sown in the field
[19:08] and the feast have been gathering which
[19:09] is at the end of the year when thou hast
[19:12] gathered in thy labors out of the field
[19:14] three times in the year
[19:15] all thy males shall appear before the
[19:17] lord god so it was required that they
[19:18] show up in these three feasts
[19:20] everybody that's in this room except
[19:22] sister esther would have had to win all
[19:23] three of those feasts
[19:24] all right now deuteronomy 16
[19:28] this one is a little more plain it says
[19:31] three times in a year shall all thy
[19:33] males appear before the lord thy god
[19:35] in the place which he shall choose in
[19:37] the feast of
[19:38] unleavened bread and in the feast of
[19:41] wheat now what is the feast of wheat
[19:42] feast of pentecost remember seven seven
[19:46] seven weeks you counted seven weeks and
[19:48] then there was a wheat harvest
[19:50] all right a feast of weeks and in the
[19:52] feast of tabernacles
[19:54] are in gathering when you gathered your
[19:55] crop for the last time
[19:57] and they shall not appear before the
[19:59] lord empty in other words you're not
[20:00] going to these feasts
[20:02] without bringing something with you all
[20:04] right
[20:05] every man shall give as he is able
[20:10] not everybody's the same position in the
[20:11] statue of a perfect man
[20:14] all right every man shall give as he is
[20:16] able according to the blessings of the
[20:18] lord thy god
[20:19] which he hath given thee you may be
[20:22] seated in the lord as blessing
[20:24] to the reading of the word if you will
[20:25] pull the chart up please and we'll kind
[20:27] of go through
[20:29] all the feasts again and that way it'll
[20:31] kind of give you a little bit of
[20:32] refresher course
[20:33] and then we will be finished here
[20:36] tonight
[20:36] so we're talking about now the the first
[20:38] one was the feast of passover
[20:40] now remember we talked about the feast
[20:42] of passover
[20:44] and what was that it was when the lamb
[20:46] was killed
[20:47] it was put up for so many days and then
[20:50] they killed the lamb and they not only
[20:52] just killed it they took the blood and
[20:53] they applied it on the doorpost
[20:55] it was something that they had to do all
[20:58] right it was a passover because the
[21:00] death angel was going to pass that night
[21:02] and it didn't matter who you were
[21:04] prophet priest or king
[21:06] if you weren't under that blood of that
[21:09] passover lamb
[21:11] you died if you were the firstborn of
[21:13] israel or the firstborn of egypt
[21:16] all right so that's why we were we were
[21:18] looking at the
[21:20] implication of that that jesus christ
[21:22] was the passover lamb
[21:24] and he died and shed his blood and then
[21:26] you and i must accept that blood
[21:28] sacrifice
[21:30] amen now look the blood doesn't save you
[21:35] it's a liquid but the symbol behind the
[21:38] life that was in that blood
[21:41] see the life that was in the animal
[21:44] blood
[21:44] couldn't come back and take away
[21:47] anything
[21:47] it just died and went on into whatever
[21:49] you want to say because they have life
[21:52] they don't have a soul they have a life
[21:55] but god accepted that until he came
[21:58] himself
[21:59] to become the supreme sacrifice
[22:02] that that man that blood cell when it
[22:04] was broke in other words when the life
[22:06] went out of that blood cell
[22:10] it didn't just evaporate it had a
[22:12] purpose
[22:14] it was eternal the blood wasn't
[22:18] that's right the blood somewhere dried
[22:21] up and went down into the cracks of the
[22:22] earth and
[22:23] and gone but it's the symbol it's the
[22:26] life behind it we know what was behind
[22:28] that life
[22:29] it was eternal and that life not only
[22:32] could come in just one back on one
[22:34] person
[22:36] it started with 120 went to 3
[22:39] 000 and now there's millions all over
[22:41] the world some that's already in the
[22:42] sixth dimension that's waiting on us
[22:45] that are waiting for this thing to
[22:47] finish up
[22:48] but it had to start somewhere so it
[22:50] started with
[22:51] a passover you know i was thinking the
[22:53] other day that's mine in your first
[22:56] month of life also
[22:59] all that other life you had
[23:03] if god forgive you of that sin and put
[23:04] it into god and to see of god's
[23:06] forgetfulness you didn't have a life
[23:07] back then
[23:10] and thank god you didn't have a life
[23:12] back then
[23:14] because god can't see it now the devil
[23:16] might be able to
[23:17] but that begins your life or your
[23:21] year that's your first month of
[23:23] existence because before then
[23:25] you didn't exist oh yeah you were a soul
[23:28] and you took care of this thing and you
[23:29] took it out and you
[23:31] you dressed it up nice and
[23:34] took it to the bars and looked good for
[23:36] the women and
[23:37] and did your thing that didn't mean
[23:40] nothing
[23:43] but when you came to that sacrifice that
[23:46] night you accepted jesus christ as your
[23:47] savior
[23:49] and you accepted that he died and that
[23:51] life came back inside of you
[23:55] that started your life
[23:58] because you're what the bible says
[23:59] you're a new creation
[24:03] a new creature
[24:06] old things have passed away behold what
[24:09] all things become what new
[24:13] lord so that's what was happening to the
[24:16] israelites they have been in bondage
[24:19] just like me and you have been in
[24:20] bondage for whatever year you want to
[24:22] declare it
[24:24] oh brother wait i never oh please
[24:32] i heard 25 tapes when i was a kid that's
[24:34] really
[24:36] so what you were still in egypt
[24:39] you were still in bondage until
[24:43] you come to calvary to that passover
[24:46] and you said lord you did that for me
[24:50] because that's what the israelites did
[24:52] in symbolic now
[24:53] they said okay their messenger which
[24:56] remember the three important things of
[24:57] passover
[24:58] god sent them a prophet give them an
[25:00] angel to guide them
[25:01] and give them a lamb to die in their
[25:03] place if they didn't have any of them
[25:05] three because it took a profit to tell
[25:07] them what to do
[25:08] moses said look go put this over the
[25:10] doorpost
[25:12] amen and you couldn't just put it on one
[25:16] you did exactly what the prophet said
[25:19] you put it over the doorpost
[25:21] because they were getting ready to
[25:23] separate
[25:25] from egypt and so were you and remember
[25:27] they never went back
[25:30] that group of people never went back to
[25:32] egypt
[25:34] you should never go back to egypt
[25:38] during this journey you their journey
[25:40] when they left
[25:41] when they left egypt they just kept on
[25:44] going now so what they went 40 years
[25:46] in the wilderness so are me and you
[25:48] that's what a bunch of hard-headed
[25:50] i was going to say americans but not
[25:52] we're hardheaded anybody
[25:55] amen even christians
[25:59] so the passover a prophet comes on the
[26:03] scene
[26:04] tells them what to do an angel is there
[26:06] to guide them
[26:07] and a lamb to cover their sin because
[26:10] what happened
[26:12] when they started on their journey when
[26:13] they started on their journey
[26:15] what did they need they needed a day of
[26:17] atonement right
[26:19] they needed every so often to be
[26:22] reminded
[26:24] these are all reminders of israel of a
[26:26] natural happening
[26:27] and these should remind me and you
[26:32] of the things here we come to unleavened
[26:34] bread which is the day after
[26:36] we see the unleavened bread what is
[26:38] unleavened bread
[26:40] it was a seven day feast brother brown
[26:43] said type in the church ages to get the
[26:45] leaven
[26:46] out of your life during that time of
[26:50] unleavened bread
[26:52] and you could you had to get it out on
[26:55] the first day and you had to keep it out
[26:56] all the way through
[26:58] same way with your new birth
[27:02] even i started to do this but i'm not
[27:06] but you can type all these with
[27:08] justification sanctification baptism
[27:09] holy ghost says what is unleavened bread
[27:11] it's getting stuff asked the unclean
[27:12] spirit going out
[27:14] leaving you when you're not born again
[27:16] yet because you get born again in
[27:17] pentecost
[27:18] all right but you got to realize right
[27:20] here though when you come to here you
[27:21] got to realize that day
[27:24] that day at calvary when god died for
[27:26] you
[27:27] you got to keep remembering that that's
[27:29] right so that's what's happening
[27:33] all the way over in atonement when we
[27:34] get to that unleavened bread with a
[27:36] seven day feast it was when it was first
[27:37] of the seven day feast
[27:39] and what happened during that time you
[27:41] were to what
[27:43] you were to get all the leaven out of
[27:44] your life get all the leaven out of your
[27:47] house and eat unleavened bread
[27:50] for seven days all right so now first
[27:52] fruit and then we come to first fruits
[27:54] now remember
[27:55] first fruits was not a was not a harvest
[27:59] of wheat
[28:01] it was a harvest of barley
[28:04] remember that it was a harvest of barley
[28:06] this is the harvest of wheat
[28:08] this is the harvest of barley when the
[28:10] first barley heart when the first ears
[28:12] came to fruition are come to maturity
[28:16] then you wave that over and they
[28:18] collected up the barley
[28:20] but it was not the wheat harvest because
[28:22] jesus christ
[28:23] died on passover stayed in the grave
[28:27] what did he do in the day of unleavened
[28:29] bread he was down
[28:30] in hell telling them people
[28:34] that they had too much leaven but what
[28:37] did he do
[28:38] he picked up them that didn't have
[28:40] leaven
[28:41] abraham isaac jacob job picked him up
[28:46] and resurrected on what sunday because
[28:49] the feast of first fruits happens
[28:52] the day after the sabbath
[28:56] all right and then jesus did all three
[29:00] right there and they fell right in order
[29:03] on three consecutive days
[29:07] and there was jesus christ the first
[29:09] fruit but he was a barley harvest he was
[29:11] what he was a common man
[29:14] he was no beauty that we should desiring
[29:17] read isaiah 53.
[29:20] he was barley made lower than the angel
[29:24] actually made lower than us because he
[29:27] took our sin
[29:29] he took every sin you ever committed
[29:32] have you ever thought about that
[29:34] when he went to calvary he didn't just
[29:36] take mine
[29:37] and i know we always say no it was just
[29:39] mine no think about it
[29:41] peter james john he took every christian
[29:45] sin plus the sin of the world
[29:48] to that day at calvary for the passover
[29:52] and he said if you'll believe in me
[29:56] i'll give you eternal life so he'd give
[30:00] it to everybody that wanted it
[30:01] it's just that some did not want it
[30:05] some people decided to stay in egypt
[30:09] that's why you talk to people and you
[30:10] try to tell them and you try to talk to
[30:12] them about the word of god and it's like
[30:13] talking to that wall why
[30:14] it's like brother brown said no
[30:16] representation
[30:18] there's no re there's no in other words
[30:20] there's nowhere in their life
[30:22] that they're going to accept it
[30:26] see now that way god can move on
[30:29] i wondered why god put a man named adolf
[30:31] hitler in this world he knew he would be
[30:32] that evil
[30:34] and then to give him to say well i'll
[30:36] give you eternal life if you'll accept
[30:38] me and he would have given it to adolf
[30:40] hitler
[30:40] but he knew that man if he'd let him
[30:43] live 10
[30:44] 000 years see that's the omnipotence of
[30:47] god
[30:48] that's the all-knowing of god he knows
[30:50] exactly if he tries to give eternal life
[30:52] to these people out here
[30:54] they'll never in a billion years ever
[30:56] come to the day that they accept it
[30:58] that's right so therefore he can let an
[31:01] adolf hitler come on the earth and then
[31:03] live out his time and then whatever
[31:05] happened to him happened to him and he
[31:06] just goes on
[31:09] what a tragic thing this man wanted all
[31:12] power
[31:14] this man wanted to take over the world
[31:16] make a supreme race
[31:19] get rid of the jews he's
[31:23] burning he's in the fifth dimension
[31:24] right now sitting waiting
[31:26] for judgment but he thought he was the
[31:28] king of the world
[31:30] he tried to be but you and i own way
[31:34] more
[31:35] than that guy ever on earth you and i
[31:39] will will will we are recipients
[31:42] of everything that everybody brother
[31:44] john has fought for
[31:46] marco polo uh all these different
[31:49] napoleon
[31:50] they tried to conquer the world
[31:53] if you've got jesus christ in your life
[31:56] tonight you have conquered everything
[32:00] oh i want to hear it in the home
[32:03] somebody say glory
[32:05] because that's what it is why do we
[32:08] fight
[32:08] and it's not bad to have money it's not
[32:12] bad to try to do better
[32:15] but when he gets in the way of god
[32:20] when he gets in the way of god seek ye
[32:24] first the kingdom of heaven
[32:25] the problem with napoleon is that he
[32:27] didn't seek the kingdom of heaven first
[32:30] jesus come and he said i'll give you
[32:33] this kingdom
[32:35] i'm the king i don't need subjects down
[32:38] here to fight for me
[32:40] i'm going to have some of them that's
[32:41] coming on a little bit later and they're
[32:43] going to be
[32:43] meek and mild and they're going to be
[32:45] some of them are going to be fighters
[32:46] like peter
[32:47] some of them you're not going to hear
[32:48] much of some of them going to make a lot
[32:50] of noise
[32:51] but you know what when all this is over
[32:54] i'm going to sit on the throne
[32:55] and they're going to sit right there
[32:56] with me it doesn't matter if you're a
[32:59] gates or a uh um berkshire hathaway guy
[33:03] and warren buffett
[33:06] they're going to die and they're almost
[33:09] going but you and i are not here's the
[33:11] when we look at first fruits
[33:16] we got the whole field
[33:19] it's ours
[33:22] just take it and that's what i try to do
[33:26] on sunday
[33:27] that's why we we declare the
[33:29] resurrection when we come to church on
[33:31] sunday
[33:32] we don't just declare the resurrection
[33:34] 2000 years ago folks
[33:36] we declare the resurrection that happens
[33:38] in here
[33:39] we should have a perpetual feast
[33:43] day not 24 hour
[33:48] but the day of the lord as john was in
[33:53] is that all right so there's the feast
[33:56] of first fruit
[33:57] the first one to come to the maturity
[33:59] jesus christ come out of the grave and
[34:01] he said what
[34:02] all power in heaven earth has been given
[34:03] unto me
[34:05] but now what did he say he said now you
[34:07] go
[34:09] take what i got i'll be back in a few
[34:12] days
[34:14] i'll be back in a few weeks
[34:18] because see you come back in seven weeks
[34:23] and he didn't come with the people he
[34:26] came in the people
[34:28] that's the difference when we see the
[34:30] feast of pentecost to the feast of weeks
[34:33] we see that we come to a place that they
[34:36] count days you complete seven sabbaths
[34:39] but remember it's it's out of the seven
[34:41] day cycle
[34:42] or seven week cycle because it's seven
[34:45] sevens it's 49
[34:46] and then the next day
[34:49] see that's where you see brother branham
[34:52] he picks up that eighth day holy
[34:53] convocation
[34:54] but then he takes it right back to all
[34:56] the to the feast of pentecost
[34:58] because you don't get born again under a
[34:59] seven
[35:01] you get born again and an eight and
[35:03] eight puts when you get born again
[35:04] you're eternal
[35:06] that is your eighth not a seven we are
[35:10] living in the day of the seven
[35:12] seven day cycle or seven week cycle but
[35:15] when you come
[35:16] to your day of pentecost which is 50
[35:18] which is 7 7 just 49
[35:21] so the first fruit the sunday after you
[35:23] see this happened on a sunday
[35:26] and this happened on a sunday jesus
[35:29] raised
[35:29] on the eighth day or the first day of
[35:33] the week
[35:34] everybody got that say amen all right so
[35:36] the same thing at the day of pentecost
[35:38] they were not born again under a seven
[35:41] they had one more day which made an
[35:44] eighth day a holy convocation
[35:46] that we see observed down here at
[35:49] tabernacles
[35:50] but it happens strangely
[35:53] at your new birth and then it's a wheat
[35:56] harvest
[35:58] remember that it's a wheat harvest
[36:01] you are so important to god
[36:05] he makes you wheat
[36:08] wheat's three times more expensive than
[36:10] barley is
[36:13] now i'm saying that's what he's done for
[36:14] us now see if you put yourself up there
[36:16] you got a problem let god put you up
[36:20] there
[36:20] remember what the bible says take the
[36:22] back seat if god wants you he'll bring
[36:25] you to the front seat
[36:26] amen so on the day of pentecost
[36:29] we see that
[36:33] we just got off of unleavened bread god
[36:36] said get that stuff out
[36:38] get that stuff that makes you rise up in
[36:40] anger
[36:42] amen but he turns that right around
[36:45] and on the day of pentecost he says you
[36:49] need to add some back
[36:52] because remember they use leaven all the
[36:54] time
[36:55] that was another question it was asked
[36:57] only on that
[36:58] seven day period did they have to get
[37:01] rid of the leaven and eat the little
[37:02] cracker the little matzah
[37:05] now after that seventh day they
[37:07] continued
[37:08] they had to add leaven when jesus was
[37:11] standing there
[37:12] giving out loaves and fishes he wasn't
[37:14] giving out crackers
[37:17] he was getting one time the bible says
[37:19] they were barley loaves
[37:22] and they were loaves not crackers
[37:25] so they added leaven back in they just
[37:28] at this point in time god wanted to say
[37:30] look
[37:31] and that's what you do every sunday you
[37:34] bring your 11 in
[37:39] you bring two types of 11. you bring
[37:42] your 11 which is sin
[37:45] and you're 11 which is what you're
[37:46] sitting in right now
[37:48] because you got to bring those two
[37:50] loaves
[37:51] as christ in the bride but christ was in
[37:54] flesh
[37:55] and now he's going to be in our flesh
[38:00] i have always said and i i have been
[38:03] through this
[38:04] message since i was a kid and they
[38:07] always beat on the flesh
[38:09] beat on the flesh beat on the women be
[38:11] on the flesh don't do this do that do
[38:13] this don't do that don't do that no
[38:15] right amen some of you didn't grow up
[38:18] through that but i know we did
[38:20] and they beat on the flesh and forgot
[38:23] about the soul
[38:27] get the soul turned around first
[38:30] amen and then there's nothing wrong with
[38:32] this leaven
[38:33] right here nothing wrong with it
[38:37] listen if there was something wrong with
[38:39] it god would give us something different
[38:40] when we got born again
[38:43] he wants us to win the battle with this
[38:44] right here
[38:47] remember not the picnic beast we need
[38:50] the combat bee
[38:51] and what's it it's in your soul working
[38:53] its way out
[38:55] and you are displaying it with this so
[38:58] when they bake the two loaves remember
[39:00] it wasn't baked in the
[39:02] in the uh temple can't do that now you
[39:06] can't put leaven in the temple
[39:08] but it was bacon in your habitation
[39:12] it was bacon in your house you baked the
[39:15] two loaves and you took them out and
[39:17] handed them to the priest
[39:18] now the priest i don't know whether he
[39:20] didn't know that was christ in the bride
[39:23] but it was an offering but in symbol it
[39:26] was christ that had to be
[39:28] in leaven when he stepped out of that
[39:31] tomb folks he was in leaven
[39:34] he was a loaf i am the bread of life
[39:39] and i'm not a real thin cracker
[39:42] i'm the bread that'll sustain you for
[39:45] all eternity
[39:48] and then they brought those two loaves
[39:49] and he said you know what i'm gonna have
[39:51] a second loaf
[39:53] because i'm not complete with just one
[39:54] loaf
[39:56] i'm going to have another loaf and you
[39:57] know what i'm going to do as i walked on
[40:00] the earth and flesh
[40:01] i go i'm going to have this bride that's
[40:04] going to walk in flesh
[40:07] on the earth and going to be wrapped up
[40:10] completely in leaven
[40:13] it's a secret folks the secret to this
[40:15] whole thing is
[40:16] is god living inside of you and you look
[40:20] no different now you understand what i
[40:21] mean we do look different or
[40:22] and we are different but standing in
[40:25] just
[40:25] an instant you look out in a crowd we
[40:28] all look the same
[40:31] but when you break us down in
[40:32] individuals and start talking about the
[40:35] word or not talking about the word
[40:37] or start using the sign language of the
[40:40] world instead of the sign language of
[40:41] the lord
[40:43] you know what i mean so there's your
[40:45] leaven that's what your leaven is going
[40:47] to display what's inside of you whatever
[40:49] it was added in your habitation when you
[40:52] cook it brother brown said you cook it
[40:54] in the oven of affliction
[40:56] when you cook it what happened to the
[40:58] three hebrew children
[41:00] who was the most preaching the other day
[41:03] they they well it's southern they hit
[41:06] that thing
[41:08] they hit that thing seven times and it
[41:09] killed the people that took him in there
[41:11] what it was that thing was so hot it
[41:12] burst their flesh
[41:13] before the other three even got there
[41:16] but what brought out that the three
[41:18] loaves
[41:20] the fourth loave in the fire amen the
[41:23] fourth loave in the fire he will be
[41:25] right here with you he'll never leave
[41:27] you
[41:28] he'll never forsake you so on the day of
[41:30] pentecost
[41:31] there was two loaves brought in because
[41:33] what happened was christ
[41:35] left the earth he took his leaven he
[41:37] couldn't stand there and say all power
[41:38] in heaven earth has been given unto me
[41:39] he was in a glorified body never could
[41:41] die again never could have a problem
[41:43] never could have a coronavirus
[41:46] amen and you know what he said
[41:49] he said now i'm going to come back and
[41:51] get in your loaf
[41:53] and i'm going to perfect that
[41:59] oh what a day of pentecost it ought to
[42:01] be a day every it shouldn't just be a
[42:02] day
[42:04] it should be every day that god used
[42:07] this loaf
[42:10] your loaf and he's gonna rapture your
[42:14] loaf
[42:16] and then you're going to see two loaves
[42:17] of bread in the millennium
[42:19] christ and his bride standing there in
[42:20] human flesh
[42:22] christ in a glorified body me and you in
[42:24] a glorified body
[42:26] cold equal amen that's what he said i i
[42:29] believe i sent romans
[42:31] he said uh uh joint heirs heirs and join
[42:33] heirs with christ
[42:34] so when christ stepped out of the tomb
[42:36] guess what we've got to come to that
[42:37] place
[42:39] all power oh all power and have a nurse
[42:42] been given to me
[42:44] no when he stepped out of that
[42:47] tomb he knew that something had changed
[42:51] his body had to yield to what was inside
[42:55] where
[42:55] at the beginning what was inside had to
[42:58] yield to the body
[43:00] doesn't that sound familiar
[43:03] doesn't that sound real familiar
[43:07] because that's what happened before you
[43:08] got born again
[43:10] but now that you're born again that
[43:12] thing inside
[43:15] is working on the outside and gives you
[43:18] a day
[43:19] of penta pentecost
[43:23] two loaves i love that christ didn't
[43:25] leave us out
[43:27] folks he's not left us out now god has
[43:30] not gone anywhere he's more close to us
[43:32] now than he
[43:32] ever has been because listen we do
[43:35] better under persecution you know why
[43:38] i've prayed more the past two weeks and
[43:40] i've prayed in
[43:41] a month if you hadn't then pray for me
[43:45] i just needed a little bit of prayer a
[43:47] little bit extra prayer
[43:49] uh push
[43:52] haven't we all haven't we all
[43:56] because we see situations right
[43:59] brother boyd's seeing one now we at home
[44:02] there
[44:03] with with one and we it it's all
[44:05] bringing it up
[44:08] and where do we depend on doctor
[44:12] god we depend on god
[44:17] there is no way we can make it without
[44:20] him
[44:22] so on the day of pentecost you know what
[44:24] peter said he said god
[44:26] he said this is that
[44:29] this is that that was promised by joel
[44:32] he got right into that old testament and
[44:34] brought it alive
[44:36] he said this is that which was spoken up
[44:39] that i'll pour out my spirit upon all
[44:42] flesh
[44:44] all loaves that'll accept him
[44:50] because truly folks i'm just going to
[44:54] say this one time
[44:55] if you're not born again you're cannon
[44:58] fodder
[45:00] you have no loaf you have no purpose
[45:06] and understand me i agree for people out
[45:08] there
[45:10] don't you but if you've accepted god
[45:16] he's put you in that loaf for a reason
[45:22] i love what brother brown said he he he
[45:25] took this one how many of you go back
[45:28] and look at the history of your life and
[45:29] see how in the world you even got here
[45:32] i'm talking physically physically got
[45:35] here
[45:37] yeah how'd you even make it to georgia
[45:38] well it's a fine place
[45:41] you know it is now but you realize your
[45:44] journey and how this one brother brown
[45:45] said this one was bred to this one and
[45:47] this one's bred to this one and this one
[45:51] and we just happened to pop up one day
[45:53] and god looked in the oven and there was
[45:55] a loaf
[45:56] well i think i'll call him bob no
[45:59] he knew you were coming he was just
[46:02] waiting on the right time
[46:04] i was reading today in the book of
[46:05] psalms this morning david said
[46:08] in continuation i was fashioned and in
[46:12] continuation in other words what
[46:13] this one come in this generation this
[46:15] one come in this generation
[46:17] inc i was fashioned lord i love that
[46:20] song i can't remember who sings i think
[46:21] it's
[46:22] um zach williams he says before
[46:27] my name was ever called on earth you
[46:29] already wrote it down in heaven
[46:32] before your mama and daddy ever called
[46:35] your sweet little name
[46:38] god already had called it in eternity if
[46:40] you're a child of his
[46:42] amen he knew your name
[46:45] before your parents even knew it so
[46:48] who's your real parent
[46:50] amen we were we
[46:54] listen we're changed in the image of
[46:56] that
[46:58] and like i said before i believe we were
[47:00] changed when you got born again that
[47:02] changed your soul
[47:03] into that 18 year old kid that god saw
[47:06] before the foundation worker brother
[47:07] brown said he put it in an album
[47:11] and he don't have to run over and go i
[47:12] think no he knows exactly who it is
[47:16] he's just waiting on you to realize it
[47:18] waiting on you to come to it i'm taking
[47:20] too long
[47:21] but this is to me this is good
[47:25] to me this is good when it gets down to
[47:27] where my loaf
[47:28] you talking about my loaf okay
[47:32] and you know sometimes god slices that
[47:34] loaf
[47:35] but you know what he does you know what
[47:36] you do when you slice loaf
[47:38] you hand it out amen that's what he
[47:42] wants you to do with your life
[47:44] god may slice that loaf and you think oh
[47:47] that hurt
[47:48] but there's a slice of bread that falls
[47:49] off and you might be able to hand it
[47:52] somebody
[47:53] and hand it to this person and hand it
[47:55] to that person
[47:56] lord cut me brother brown said one time
[47:59] share me lord you shared me one time you
[48:02] sheared me again what about a man
[48:04] that prayed for the sick by the millions
[48:07] and he watched his baby die
[48:10] he said god pulled the black sheep down
[48:12] in front of my eyes
[48:14] just because he didn't do what god told
[48:15] him to do
[48:17] but you know what he said it's all
[48:20] brother branham
[48:21] did you hold on your religion he said
[48:23] nope he said my religion
[48:26] held on to me and that's what it was
[48:29] that
[48:29] inside of the inside that's right
[48:32] it says the lord giveth and the lord
[48:36] taketh away
[48:38] blessed be the name of the lord amen
[48:41] so pentecost complete seven sabbaths 49
[48:44] days
[48:45] 50 days which was the eighth day and
[48:47] remember we were talking about
[48:49] uh circumcision when the circumcision
[48:51] happened on the eighth day
[48:53] and you and i were circumcised on the
[48:55] eighth day
[48:56] of our journey when we received the new
[48:59] birth all right so let's go
[49:00] down to trumpets because remember from
[49:03] pentecost to trumpets you're looking at
[49:05] you know your first three months
[49:07] basically and then you got about a three
[49:09] month what dry spell
[49:14] you got about a three month you got
[49:16] about a three year you may have even a
[49:17] third a year
[49:19] dry spell where you don't hear a whole
[49:21] lot from god
[49:24] but he's trying you to make sure
[49:28] that you know that you know
[49:31] that you know when you've done all you
[49:34] can do
[49:35] god i've applied to blood i've cleaned
[49:38] as much sin as i know of out of my life
[49:40] lord forgive me
[49:43] you come to the first fruits to where
[49:44] you know that you come to church you
[49:47] read your bible you study
[49:48] you press play when you want to not when
[49:51] you have to
[49:54] and then you come to that day of
[49:55] pentecost where you know
[49:57] something anchored in then guess what
[50:01] stand just like i said like brother
[50:04] brown said
[50:04] all you've done all you can do just
[50:05] stand right there if you're seeking the
[50:07] baptism of holy ghost
[50:08] you're gonna fight and fight and fight
[50:10] but you know what you're doing you're
[50:11] standing there
[50:13] what did ruth do you can't give yourself
[50:15] the holy ghost
[50:19] ruth couldn't do anything what did naomi
[50:22] say
[50:22] she said you go rest
[50:25] even boaz said uh you go rest it's my
[50:28] time to work
[50:29] let god fight our battles for us let's
[50:32] don't try to figure something out let
[50:34] him try to let him not try
[50:35] because he's never lost a battle he
[50:37] never went into a battle and lost one
[50:40] now we have and even the devil has
[50:43] but god's never went into the battle
[50:45] into a battle that he's lost
[50:50] so we come now to the feast of trumpets
[50:52] because what's going to happen
[50:54] and we think that sometimes it is
[50:56] silence in heaven for the space of
[50:58] not even a half hours but 30 years
[51:00] sometimes you know
[51:01] right sure if you've never been through
[51:04] a dry spell you're fixing to go through
[51:05] one
[51:05] that's right because everybody's going
[51:07] to go through that what wilderness
[51:09] journey
[51:11] uh-huh real dry and and ain't got
[51:14] nothing to eat
[51:16] and you think like you know you're the
[51:17] only one on the island and
[51:20] and the sand is all you got and a couple
[51:23] of trees and that's all but
[51:24] no god had his hand on that
[51:28] on the children of israel the whole time
[51:31] listen he was so much in the camp
[51:34] listen he was so much in the camp so
[51:37] much in your camp listen
[51:42] two million people
[51:45] got fed every day
[51:50] and watered 2 million not 2.
[51:55] he knew that 99 of them wasn't going to
[51:58] make it
[51:59] he fed him anyway he clothed them anyway
[52:05] same way on our journey folks i can see
[52:08] the children of israel going to these
[52:09] different ones
[52:11] and they look in these journeys and they
[52:13] what they do they murmured and
[52:14] complained all the time
[52:16] they sinned like 10 times but as they
[52:18] would get finished sinning you know they
[52:20] wanted
[52:20] well you know what this bread ain't
[52:22] enough
[52:24] we loathe this thing because every day
[52:26] we got to come pick it up
[52:28] every and if we hold any over oh it
[52:31] turns into wiggle worms and we can't eat
[52:33] it and
[52:34] but god give them enough on the sixth
[52:36] day
[52:38] he gave them a double portion to make it
[52:40] through the next day
[52:41] he had this thing written
[52:44] they plant them meals out in in them
[52:47] schools
[52:48] and and and they ain't nothing to what
[52:50] god done
[52:51] nothing two million people a day plus
[52:54] horses and camels and
[52:56] oh whatever else they took right and the
[53:00] water didn't just trickle out
[53:04] it's like five fire hydrants at one time
[53:10] because you ever seen a cow tea knows
[53:11] about cow cow drink 50 gallons of water
[53:13] in a day
[53:14] easy almost cause they'll suck you down
[53:17] what about a camel
[53:18] and two million people and they didn't
[53:20] have coca-colas
[53:23] and pop they didn't have dr peppers
[53:27] they didn't they had water that was
[53:29] sustaining
[53:30] life they had was what and god through
[53:33] your journey folks
[53:34] what are you saying by the way through
[53:35] our journey
[53:37] god's going to give you not what you
[53:40] want
[53:41] he's going to give you what you need
[53:44] because remember
[53:45] they couldn't hold over from one day the
[53:47] next somebody said well i'm going to
[53:48] gather a little bit extra because
[53:50] i might have a midnight snack god said
[53:52] no i didn't say that
[53:56] you're not gonna die your clothes are
[53:59] even getting new
[54:00] every day obviously they didn't have a
[54:03] weight gain
[54:04] issue like we do
[54:08] if it did their clothes just grew with
[54:10] them louise some kind of nylon i don't
[54:12] know but
[54:13] but you see what god did every day just
[54:15] like a bunch of kids
[54:18] what more that he knew they were going
[54:21] to
[54:22] not make it but he knows you're going to
[54:25] make it
[54:26] he knows whether you're going to make it
[54:28] or not if you're a child of god you're
[54:30] going to make it
[54:32] so he's right there giving you
[54:33] everything you
[54:35] need not everything you want
[54:41] but then all of a sudden about three and
[54:44] a half months later
[54:46] of this long journey
[54:50] drawn out silence we've come up now
[54:54] you know dad's been laboring for 50
[54:57] years
[54:58] some of you been in the message that
[55:00] long some not
[55:02] doesn't matter it's just the labor and
[55:04] all of a sudden
[55:07] you're going to hear a trumpet
[55:10] and you're not going to hear a trumpet
[55:12] with an uncertain sound because
[55:14] because what did joshua and caleb they
[55:16] never
[55:17] got away from their first revelation
[55:21] everybody got that joshua and caleb
[55:24] never got away from their first
[55:26] revelation
[55:26] what about two men in two million
[55:30] unbelievers
[55:31] thinking think about you got a problem
[55:33] in three or four hundred people in your
[55:35] department or wherever it is you work or
[55:36] even three or four
[55:38] two million people and joshua and caleb
[55:42] said
[55:43] today we're more than able to take this
[55:46] thing
[55:49] and remember if you'll remember the
[55:50] reason that what this day right here
[55:54] the feast of weeks is one of the three
[55:55] is because remember that's the day the
[55:57] law was given
[55:59] 50 days after they left egypt at mount
[56:02] sinai god give them the law on the day
[56:04] of pentecost
[56:06] the day of pentecost amen
[56:09] so they had something to go by and they
[56:12] still hated it
[56:14] we'll do all brother dale says
[56:22] we'll do all moses said whatever god
[56:24] says that's what we'll do
[56:27] joshua and caleb's going now you ain't
[56:31] cause you can't see what we see
[56:34] what is joshua top of the baptism in the
[56:36] holy ghost right and caleb is the type
[56:38] of me and you
[56:41] he walked through 40 years of unbelief
[56:46] and he was like 80 years old when they
[56:48] got to that end
[56:49] and he said um didn't you give me that
[56:53] mountain
[56:53] 40 years ago
[56:56] didn't you give me that mountain didn't
[56:59] you give me a
[57:00] birthright to that mountain
[57:06] you in this church have a birthright to
[57:08] that mountain
[57:11] and if you can't claim it now like you
[57:13] did 40 years ago 40 days ago 40 minutes
[57:16] ago
[57:17] you're not a caleb
[57:20] caleb waited 40 years
[57:26] with them unbelievers and they're going
[57:29] joshua and caleb's going we good we're
[57:32] all right
[57:34] because see they got a revelation at the
[57:35] beginning of their journey
[57:38] that they were going to the promised
[57:39] land because they already got a little
[57:41] glimpse of it
[57:43] but remember them other 10 lion
[57:44] preachers is what kept them out
[57:47] oh my you ought to preach a certain oh i
[57:48] did so anyway
[57:50] feast of trumpets we'll get we'll get to
[57:53] this everybody all right
[57:55] what is a trumpet a trumpet is a message
[57:59] amen a trumpet is a message the feast of
[58:03] trumpets
[58:05] sounds a message and remember we read
[58:08] the scripture at the last
[58:09] trump for the trumpet shall sound
[58:12] there's a two part to even your journey
[58:16] you get born again under the trump
[58:21] what's the trump do you you're standing
[58:22] out in the crowd standing out there in
[58:24] the wilderness
[58:26] nothing going on maybe the birds
[58:28] chirping or the crickets chirping or the
[58:30] frogs chirping or whatever
[58:31] for frogs to do whatever they're doing
[58:33] frogs don't chirp i know that
[58:36] i just know about frog gigging i can't
[58:38] thought what's frogs do frogs
[58:41] frogs burp bee wait and all of a sudden
[58:47] what are you gonna do now you're not
[58:49] worried about you're not worried about
[58:51] like when our train goes by at the house
[58:54] i'm so used to it i never even looked
[58:56] but we were standing out yesterday
[58:57] talking to a technician from atnt and
[58:59] we were standing there talking and that
[59:01] guy hit that horn about not at my
[59:03] not at my crossing the one down there
[59:05] about a half a mile
[59:07] and he goes when he did i think he
[59:09] almost jumped in the bucket
[59:11] because he wasn't used to that sound but
[59:14] i was
[59:15] you know why because it was familiar
[59:19] if the trumpet makes an uncertain sound
[59:23] see it's scary
[59:26] but if it's just a if it's a if it's a
[59:28] sound that you know that's coming and
[59:31] and you know that it means something
[59:34] what does that trumpet mean in that
[59:36] instance it means danger
[59:39] don't come across this railroad track
[59:41] while i'm blowing this horn
[59:43] same way with god he wakes us up
[59:48] at the last trump the trump wakes you up
[59:51] inside
[59:52] right here to me the the feast of
[59:54] trumpets or your feast of your trumpet
[59:56] sounds right here
[59:57] because there's a trump that sounds and
[59:59] you say oh god
[1:00:01] that's for me you're talking to me
[1:00:05] you listen you got to hear something
[1:00:06] from somebody
[1:00:08] i don't care what it is you can't
[1:00:11] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:00:13] without
[1:00:13] realizing you're lost and but realizing
[1:00:17] you're lost is not just you sitting
[1:00:19] under a pine tree
[1:00:21] half asleep no you come to a realization
[1:00:25] and something goes
[1:00:30] that's a sound i hadn't heard
[1:00:33] i've heard my hip hop
[1:00:37] i've heard my lionel richie
[1:00:41] john knows who i'm coming up line up
[1:00:44] come on now
[1:00:46] but you let but see that that's the
[1:00:47] familiar sound of the world
[1:00:50] but see that's unfamiliar now you turn
[1:00:52] that baby off
[1:00:54] where we used to luis was finding the up
[1:00:56] button turn that thing up let me hip hop
[1:00:58] a little bit more
[1:01:00] huh at the base
[1:01:04] base all right but you heard a gospel
[1:01:07] trumpet
[1:01:09] i'm being silly but you did you heard
[1:01:11] all these other sounds and noises
[1:01:13] and you were acquainted with that
[1:01:17] right you actually identified with a lot
[1:01:19] of those
[1:01:20] trumpet sounds but when you heard the
[1:01:22] trump
[1:01:24] that trump of god that says
[1:01:27] danny time for you to turn around
[1:01:33] time for you to listen to what i got to
[1:01:34] say
[1:01:36] because on the feast of the trumpets
[1:01:37] what happened it was coming up to the
[1:01:39] fall
[1:01:40] this is all your summer feasts this
[1:01:42] these feasts are all like i said before
[1:01:44] these feasts
[1:01:45] were now these feasts went on all year
[1:01:47] when jesus was here there was a lot of
[1:01:49] times he was in the tabernacle
[1:01:50] and on the feast of tabernacles but
[1:01:54] what he was involved in was right here
[1:01:56] he died at calvary
[1:01:58] he stayed dead the next day yeah he was
[1:02:00] dead his body was dead his soul wasn't
[1:02:03] yours is not either if you pass away and
[1:02:06] then he resurrected
[1:02:07] and then he came back in spirit form on
[1:02:09] the day of pentecost now what's these
[1:02:11] other three
[1:02:12] these other three have to be done by me
[1:02:14] and you
[1:02:15] or by something that's going to be at
[1:02:18] the not the harvest here
[1:02:21] but the last harvest i was reading the
[1:02:25] commentary just a few minutes ago
[1:02:26] the feast of tabernacles was a joyous
[1:02:29] feast
[1:02:30] but it also was a feast where you had to
[1:02:33] get ready
[1:02:35] for the planting of the next year
[1:02:38] because you gathered in all your
[1:02:39] harvests see there won't be one of us
[1:02:42] left
[1:02:44] that's why we're under the feast of
[1:02:46] tabernacles god is going to
[1:02:48] what harvest his bride
[1:02:51] and then he's going planting where to
[1:02:55] israel
[1:02:57] he's going right over there to open
[1:02:58] their eyes and plant
[1:03:00] over there to gather a harvest
[1:03:04] under the feast of tabernacles all right
[1:03:07] everybody okay
[1:03:08] so the feast of trump is
[1:03:12] good evening friends
[1:03:16] boy that that just you know what's
[1:03:18] coming afterwards
[1:03:19] it's not really that content
[1:03:23] a lot of people say good evening friends
[1:03:25] but when you heard that on the tape you
[1:03:26] knew something was coming
[1:03:28] or when you were in service which was
[1:03:30] none of us sitting here i think it was
[1:03:31] maybe about tony
[1:03:32] but when you were in service and he said
[1:03:34] good evening friends you really didn't
[1:03:35] really know what was going on but now we
[1:03:36] know
[1:03:38] that that trumpet makes a certain sound
[1:03:42] because you can hear it listen you can
[1:03:43] hear a gospel trump and it not be the
[1:03:45] message of the hour
[1:03:46] we don't explain that is everybody okay
[1:03:47] with that
[1:03:49] but you can't hear the last trumpet
[1:03:53] and not hear the message of the hour
[1:03:56] can't do that
[1:03:56] this is the last trumpet this is the
[1:03:59] last church age this was the last church
[1:04:02] age messenger
[1:04:03] and under her messenger you and i are to
[1:04:05] be the final voice
[1:04:07] the final trumpet to the final age
[1:04:12] amen so we're getting ready though
[1:04:16] for our fall feast because like i said
[1:04:18] before
[1:04:19] you've got harvest here barley wheat
[1:04:24] fruit you're coming to a fruit harvest
[1:04:27] god's not going to harvest your wheat
[1:04:31] he's done done that he's got your loaf
[1:04:36] he's going to physically take you out of
[1:04:38] here but by what
[1:04:40] the fruit that you bear that's right
[1:04:44] the fruit that you bear that's what he's
[1:04:45] going to take out of here it's not going
[1:04:46] to take luis yourego out of here
[1:04:49] no he's going to take what luis yourego
[1:04:51] has become
[1:04:53] because of what god has planted he's
[1:04:56] going to become that and that's what god
[1:04:58] is going to harvest
[1:05:00] listen we know one thing's for sure
[1:05:01] god's not coming back after you he's
[1:05:03] coming back after himself
[1:05:06] he's coming to get a part of him
[1:05:09] just like the armored meat packing guy
[1:05:11] he's coming back to get a part of him or
[1:05:12] he wouldn't be coming back
[1:05:15] he has decided that was his bride and
[1:05:17] the bride had decided that's my husband
[1:05:20] amen and he's coming back to get a part
[1:05:23] of himself
[1:05:32] and i love this part here on the feast
[1:05:34] of trumpets
[1:05:36] that there's two special silver trumpets
[1:05:39] announced that feast announced the
[1:05:43] sacrifice
[1:05:44] when the trumpet sounds the signal all
[1:05:46] the people who were within the sacrifice
[1:05:48] prostrate themselves stretch out flat
[1:05:51] face down on the ground
[1:05:52] two special silver trumpets
[1:05:58] the two witnesses are going to come on
[1:06:00] the scene
[1:06:01] because what they're going to do is
[1:06:02] they're going to sound a trumpet
[1:06:04] two witnesses they're going to sound a
[1:06:07] trumpet
[1:06:08] and what's he going to take them to the
[1:06:10] day of atonement
[1:06:12] not that christ is going to have to be
[1:06:14] killed again they're going to realize
[1:06:17] they're going to mourn the day of
[1:06:19] atonement
[1:06:20] is a day that you realize what happened
[1:06:24] and you realize that it either happened
[1:06:27] to you
[1:06:28] or it's happened somewhere else
[1:06:33] anybody good this is the first time the
[1:06:36] bible tells you to afflict your soul
[1:06:41] i say today afflict your soul
[1:06:46] what do you mean brother wade make sure
[1:06:47] you've got what you think you got
[1:06:50] make sure you got make sure that you
[1:06:52] know that you know that you know
[1:06:54] where brother wait how do i know stand
[1:06:56] right where you're at
[1:06:58] now that don't mean stand right here
[1:07:00] like that
[1:07:01] okay that means stand on what you got
[1:07:05] stand right there on what you got and
[1:07:07] say god i'd be like that man i said god
[1:07:10] if you don't give me the holy ghost
[1:07:11] you're gonna find a bag of bones right
[1:07:12] here in this one spot
[1:07:14] have you ever been that desperate you
[1:07:16] need to be that desperate somewhere in
[1:07:18] your life
[1:07:19] that your life has just went to
[1:07:23] i mean like the children of israel
[1:07:26] they just that god gave them quail
[1:07:29] they also paid for it you know why
[1:07:32] because it wasn't part of god's required
[1:07:34] plan
[1:07:36] his required plan was manna
[1:07:39] but they wanted something different they
[1:07:42] wanted to interject
[1:07:43] something else into the program now see
[1:07:45] that's our problem
[1:07:47] but you know what he'll allow us under
[1:07:49] permissive will he'll allow us to do
[1:07:51] that
[1:07:52] but look what it does about 20 something
[1:07:56] thousand of them died
[1:07:59] because there were serpents came out and
[1:08:01] bit them
[1:08:03] and they died why because it wasn't a
[1:08:05] part of god's required plan
[1:08:08] he said i am the bread of life he didn't
[1:08:11] say i'm the quail of life
[1:08:13] i mean really you just look you do what
[1:08:15] god said
[1:08:17] that's just and you say well that's do's
[1:08:18] and don'ts no it's really honest
[1:08:21] i don't go home and say go go home to
[1:08:24] jim cook lord i got to say i love you
[1:08:29] no there's a longing that if i don't see
[1:08:31] her
[1:08:33] i want to see her so bad don't you think
[1:08:35] god wants to see us so bad
[1:08:39] he's been so long in these feasts
[1:08:42] he's trying to get to israel but he's
[1:08:44] got to take me and you out of the way
[1:08:45] first
[1:08:46] all right so now also in the day of
[1:08:48] atonement
[1:08:50] we see that there's two goats brought in
[1:08:54] all right there's two goats brought in
[1:08:58] on the day of atonement and what one it
[1:09:00] flicks your soul then they take one goat
[1:09:02] and they kill it
[1:09:02] top of christ being killed for our sin
[1:09:05] and then not just being killed that day
[1:09:07] for our sin
[1:09:09] see because the scapegoat is not we know
[1:09:11] christ died in
[1:09:12] 2000 years ago at calvary for all the
[1:09:14] sins of the world
[1:09:16] but that didn't do away with all the sin
[1:09:17] of the world
[1:09:20] people just kept right on center but the
[1:09:23] scapegoat
[1:09:25] is the one i depend on that he takes
[1:09:29] that blood of that dead one
[1:09:32] and he carries it all the way into the
[1:09:34] sea of god's forgetfulness never to be
[1:09:36] remembered again
[1:09:37] that's the one i want because remember
[1:09:40] when you hit your knees and you
[1:09:42] say god i did that i know i did it and i
[1:09:46] know it was wrong
[1:09:49] and you know it was wrong please forgive
[1:09:52] me of that
[1:09:54] there goes the goat there goes the goat
[1:09:58] you got you got to see that that sin now
[1:10:00] has been carried away
[1:10:02] even through two thousand years of of
[1:10:05] heartache and trouble
[1:10:06] god had a bride a sinless
[1:10:10] spotless bride why because he took their
[1:10:12] sin
[1:10:14] as far as the east is from the west or
[1:10:16] as i say
[1:10:17] off into the sea of forgetfulness never
[1:10:19] to be remembered again
[1:10:22] the day of atonement on that day of
[1:10:23] atonement remember to
[1:10:25] israel's eyes will be open
[1:10:29] when the two trumpets sound the two
[1:10:30] silver trumpets sounds the message
[1:10:34] the message and then
[1:10:37] the 144 000 god releases their eyes so
[1:10:41] they can see
[1:10:42] remember he's got his hand over their
[1:10:44] eyes blinding them so that you and i can
[1:10:46] come in but see since when me and you i
[1:10:48] me you and i come in he has no reason to
[1:10:51] blind him anymore
[1:10:53] now he has another purpose he's got to
[1:10:54] go get them
[1:10:57] because there listen they are very
[1:10:58] important in this plan of redemption
[1:11:01] he said i'll never forget israel
[1:11:05] so he's not going to forget her listen
[1:11:08] boaz never forgot naomi
[1:11:12] never forgot her when she come to the
[1:11:13] very end they actually
[1:11:15] had a baby and handed it to naomi a type
[1:11:18] of what's going to happen to us
[1:11:20] we're going to take this jesus christ
[1:11:22] and we're going to hand it to israel
[1:11:24] through two witnesses and we're going to
[1:11:26] say here here's your salvation
[1:11:30] your eyes will be opened on the day of
[1:11:32] atonement and they're going to realize
[1:11:35] there in zechariah they realize that
[1:11:38] they had killed jesus christ
[1:11:40] 2 000 years ago so that day of atonement
[1:11:43] even our day of atonement we must
[1:11:45] always look back to calvary
[1:11:48] always look back to calvary because what
[1:11:50] does calvary do
[1:11:52] calvary gives you the two goats
[1:11:55] the one that died right there and the
[1:11:58] blood that keeps us covered
[1:12:01] brother brown said this world right now
[1:12:03] is covered
[1:12:04] with a small finger of blood all the way
[1:12:07] around and he said he don't see your sin
[1:12:09] he looks he hears your voice
[1:12:14] i say thank you too thank you for the
[1:12:17] atonement
[1:12:19] thank you that we come to a day that we
[1:12:20] realize that that atonement
[1:12:24] was eternal the bible talks about
[1:12:27] eternal redemption
[1:12:29] somebody read it the other day eternal
[1:12:31] redemption
[1:12:32] you know what eternal redemption is when
[1:12:34] we get to heaven jesus is going to have
[1:12:36] the scars still in his hands
[1:12:39] he's going to have the wound in his side
[1:12:42] and he's going to have
[1:12:43] footprint nails in his in his feet
[1:12:47] and he's going to that's going to be our
[1:12:49] eternal
[1:12:50] he's our eternal sacrifice he's going to
[1:12:53] let and you and i are going to walk
[1:12:54] around in a complete
[1:12:55] beautiful no cuts on us no blemishes
[1:13:00] and he's going to walk around for an
[1:13:02] eternity just to show
[1:13:04] see we'll come to that day of atonement
[1:13:07] you need to come to that day of
[1:13:08] atonement every once in a while yourself
[1:13:09] and do some checking up
[1:13:12] check up a little bit because you know
[1:13:13] what the very next feast
[1:13:15] is going to be a harvest
[1:13:20] the day of atonement's one day when we
[1:13:22] come to the feast of tabernacles it's a
[1:13:24] seven day feast
[1:13:25] and you have to go get boughs and you
[1:13:27] have to do a little bit of work
[1:13:32] you got to gather in what the fruit
[1:13:36] but i picked this up the other day i
[1:13:37] want you to see in john 1 14
[1:13:40] don't don't pick it up just leave it
[1:13:41] right there in john 1 14
[1:13:43] remember john said in the beginning was
[1:13:46] the word
[1:13:47] the word was with god and the word was
[1:13:48] god
[1:13:50] then we always like to skip over to 14
[1:13:52] and the word
[1:13:53] was made flesh and dwelt
[1:13:57] look that word dwelt up that word
[1:14:01] dwelt john used that word dwell because
[1:14:03] it means to dwell
[1:14:05] in a tent
[1:14:08] you say well he dwelt among us no he
[1:14:10] dwelt in a tent
[1:14:13] called jesus christ now he dwells in
[1:14:16] your tent
[1:14:18] called whoever you whatever your name is
[1:14:21] all right so this fault this means that
[1:14:22] the fall feast is complete
[1:14:24] it's a seven day feast and they rest in
[1:14:27] booths for seven days
[1:14:31] they sit out there for seven days in the
[1:14:32] booth they make little bitty houses and
[1:14:34] they go sit in it
[1:14:37] and it reminds them that god give them
[1:14:41] tends to live in the wilderness
[1:14:43] and protected them for 40 years
[1:14:47] protected them for 40 years so he
[1:14:50] protected you for the same amount of
[1:14:52] time
[1:14:53] but now remember what is connected to
[1:14:55] this the feast of tabernacles if we are
[1:14:58] now
[1:14:58] feasting brother brown said under the
[1:15:00] feast of tabernacles we're feasting
[1:15:02] under a seven
[1:15:04] because it's a seven day feast but then
[1:15:06] remember where brother brown picks up
[1:15:08] the bible says
[1:15:09] on the eighth day is a holy
[1:15:12] convocation on the eighth day
[1:15:16] is when you are born again it's on the
[1:15:18] eighth day
[1:15:19] when you're circumcised it's on the
[1:15:22] eighth day when eternity begins
[1:15:24] so the feast of tabernacles see you and
[1:15:28] i
[1:15:28] are under the feast of tabernacles here
[1:15:31] but you and i
[1:15:31] are not under the feast of tabernacles
[1:15:36] as that is because you've separated from
[1:15:38] the world
[1:15:41] he's inside of you now
[1:15:44] because what does revelations 3 say
[1:15:47] i've been able to sit with my father on
[1:15:49] his throne
[1:15:51] and you are going to sit with me not on
[1:15:54] the throne
[1:15:55] the bible says in the throne look how
[1:15:58] intimate that is that's intimate so see
[1:16:01] israel can go out and sit in booths and
[1:16:03] they can say oh god protected us and and
[1:16:06] we're
[1:16:06] this is what they're saying now oh we're
[1:16:08] waiting for the messiah and we're the
[1:16:10] chosen people
[1:16:11] and those gentiles are dogs and here we
[1:16:14] are sitting today
[1:16:16] knowing that god is in your tabernacle
[1:16:20] he owns that loaf of bread he needs that
[1:16:24] loaf
[1:16:25] bro wait he yes he does
[1:16:28] he needs a body
[1:16:31] he's the head i'm just reading scripture
[1:16:34] he's the head
[1:16:35] we are the body he has no body
[1:16:38] on this earth today but our body and
[1:16:41] when we give him headship
[1:16:44] he is not it's not just us alone in this
[1:16:47] tabernacle
[1:16:49] we're sitting with him in his throne
[1:16:52] not on the throne in in the throne
[1:16:56] the throne room now is not over yonder
[1:16:59] with the holy of holies and all
[1:17:00] no that was done away with by
[1:17:04] more pure the bible says and perfect
[1:17:07] sacrifice so the feast of tabernacles it
[1:17:11] lets
[1:17:12] us realize to me it lets me realize that
[1:17:16] i'm still human
[1:17:18] but i'm eternal on the inside i am in a
[1:17:21] booth
[1:17:22] and i am feasting under the feast of
[1:17:24] tabernacles
[1:17:26] listening to the message of the hour
[1:17:27] listening to these brothers preach
[1:17:29] listening to testimonies from people
[1:17:31] what god's done in their life
[1:17:32] listening to all these things and it
[1:17:34] ain't crowded in my house
[1:17:38] there ain't three or four of us in there
[1:17:43] if he if he told me sister asked her if
[1:17:46] he told me i'm just dumb enough to
[1:17:48] believe that
[1:17:49] i can sit with him in his throne and
[1:17:51] they it's plenty of room
[1:17:54] you can be there and you can be there
[1:17:55] and you can be there but that's the
[1:17:58] symbol of what that
[1:17:59] feast of tabernacles is it's a seven day
[1:18:02] feast and then you go
[1:18:03] to the eighth day holy convocation
[1:18:08] look what happens when brother brown
[1:18:10] picked that up i want you to see how far
[1:18:11] that was
[1:18:13] we'll be finished in a few minutes how
[1:18:15] far that was
[1:18:17] because if we're feasting on the feast
[1:18:18] of tabernacles
[1:18:20] we're feasting still in the seventh
[1:18:21] church age right
[1:18:24] and that's got to go to the one week
[1:18:27] left for the jews
[1:18:29] that's got to go to the thousand years
[1:18:31] of millennial reign
[1:18:34] and you're still in the seven but you
[1:18:36] and i the day we got born again
[1:18:40] we stepped into the eight and all we're
[1:18:43] waiting on
[1:18:44] is the feast of tabernacles to end
[1:18:50] for you some have already laid their
[1:18:53] tabernacle
[1:18:54] down because they got too old or they
[1:18:56] something happened in their life
[1:18:57] who i don't know that's god's providence
[1:18:59] not mine
[1:19:01] but they're waiting on me and you
[1:19:03] because you know what
[1:19:05] they're not in their right to be booth
[1:19:11] what is there right to be booth the
[1:19:13] flesh they lived in on earth because
[1:19:15] that's their
[1:19:15] that's their possession that was
[1:19:18] something satan had a hold on he watched
[1:19:20] it die
[1:19:22] satan went to all the funerals and said
[1:19:26] but remember he can't even get i don't
[1:19:29] believe satan knows where the sixth
[1:19:30] dimension is
[1:19:31] oh hallelujah i hate he can't even touch
[1:19:34] it i don't think he knows where he's at
[1:19:37] that's right they just disappear brother
[1:19:40] gary they just disappear and satan's
[1:19:41] going
[1:19:42] i had him i had him here
[1:19:45] just a second ago i had him
[1:19:51] i'm just i just the way i believe i
[1:19:53] don't say satan ain't got nothing to do
[1:19:55] with that sixth dimension
[1:19:57] god put the believers in that dimension
[1:19:59] he put perfect love in that dimension
[1:20:02] and satan ain't got he can't even
[1:20:04] scratch the wall
[1:20:09] can't even peek over in there and see
[1:20:11] who she just don't know nothing about
[1:20:12] them people
[1:20:13] but you know what's gonna happen one day
[1:20:20] where'd you come from you didn't look
[1:20:23] that way when you went down that place
[1:20:25] right there
[1:20:27] your old body's laying down there it's
[1:20:29] rotten
[1:20:30] job it's dust paul
[1:20:34] peter you're dust
[1:20:38] hey we're more alive than you ever ever
[1:20:40] will be
[1:20:43] so you see what's coming that's what's
[1:20:45] coming that's a reality
[1:20:48] that when they step back in this
[1:20:49] dimension the devil is going to know
[1:20:52] he's in trouble because you know one
[1:20:56] thing's for sure
[1:20:58] death in your tabernacle is fixing to be
[1:21:00] destroyed
[1:21:01] and we're fixing to just take what satan
[1:21:04] has used all them years
[1:21:07] and bent us over made us ache where we
[1:21:11] didn't know we had a
[1:21:14] didn't know we had a muscle
[1:21:18] took all of our hair away
[1:21:23] but when they come back through that
[1:21:24] dimension
[1:21:26] he's going to have to shake his head
[1:21:30] because you know what he's not the daddy
[1:21:34] that took your picture
[1:21:39] he will not recognize you because he saw
[1:21:41] you when you were born in sin
[1:21:42] shaping iniquity but god looks back at
[1:21:46] that picture before the foundation of
[1:21:48] the world
[1:21:48] and he said that's what you're going to
[1:21:50] look like
[1:21:54] satan's going to go i shout out
[1:21:59] shut up you have no hold right
[1:22:03] over me anymore resist the devil
[1:22:07] and he'll flee from you tabernacles
[1:22:11] you say oh i hate this thing i'm in this
[1:22:12] old pest house yeah
[1:22:14] in the condition that it's in
[1:22:18] but you're going to live in what you've
[1:22:19] got for an eternity
[1:22:22] but it's going to be brought back young
[1:22:23] again and to me that's the great mystery
[1:22:27] that satan can't find it's where them
[1:22:30] people are now
[1:22:31] and what's fixing to happen when they
[1:22:33] come back across here because he's a
[1:22:35] spiritual guy
[1:22:37] he's a spiritual man remember he's the
[1:22:39] he's the second man
[1:22:41] to the god in spirituality amen
[1:22:45] he's the anointed cherub i made you
[1:22:48] perfect god said until iniquity was
[1:22:50] found in you
[1:22:51] so he's a spiritual man he's going to
[1:22:52] feel that and he's going to go where'd
[1:22:54] that come from
[1:22:57] and god's just over going
[1:23:00] he don't have to explain to him because
[1:23:03] you know what's going to explain it to
[1:23:04] him
[1:23:05] it's when them dead saints come out of
[1:23:06] that ground
[1:23:08] it's when they walk back in here in a
[1:23:09] glorified body and then me and you
[1:23:11] brother brown said death will crawl up
[1:23:13] your arm and you'll go
[1:23:15] because you know what that is that's
[1:23:16] devil that's not god
[1:23:19] that's the devil doing now and you just
[1:23:20] go i think that's what we're getting
[1:23:22] trained for now
[1:23:25] i think that's what we're getting he's
[1:23:26] give us warfare to train for this
[1:23:29] and i just feel that's what we're we're
[1:23:31] training for
[1:23:33] is that boy has death not ever been as
[1:23:35] close to now
[1:23:37] i want to ask all of you has death never
[1:23:39] been as close as it is now
[1:23:42] because we're looking at this thing and
[1:23:43] we know one thing like like tony
[1:23:45] hamilton
[1:23:45] he was okay a week ago dead today
[1:23:50] another person at uh josh um leo
[1:23:54] at school gone
[1:23:58] death is so close but what are we doing
[1:24:01] about it
[1:24:03] we're running off and going where's god
[1:24:05] no
[1:24:07] we're going to continue on as we can
[1:24:09] we're going to pray for everybody we can
[1:24:11] we're going to pray fervently
[1:24:13] and we're going to see him come through
[1:24:14] this and all
[1:24:16] in the feast of tabernacles because the
[1:24:19] first time this earth sees that feast
[1:24:22] culminate will be in the future home
[1:24:24] when it goes through the seven
[1:24:26] and when they step into the eighth day
[1:24:29] there's your future home brother brown
[1:24:31] when he preached that message he
[1:24:32] preached it
[1:24:33] a thousand years
[1:24:36] back this side of when it's going to
[1:24:38] happen what a prophet
[1:24:40] nobody knew much about the future future
[1:24:42] home right
[1:24:46] listen folks we grew up in the baptist
[1:24:47] church where they said heaven and earth
[1:24:49] will pass away that's exactly what the
[1:24:50] bible says
[1:24:52] right so boom and we're just gonna we're
[1:24:55] gonna be
[1:24:55] on a cloud you know
[1:25:00] even brother brown remember he said i'd
[1:25:02] go brother neville hey brother neville
[1:25:04] couldn't shake his hand because because
[1:25:06] you're just not really real you know you
[1:25:08] got your harp up there and you're
[1:25:09] sitting on a cloud they know what we
[1:25:11] were all brought up
[1:25:14] then we had a prophet come and say ah
[1:25:16] brother branham you've run out of your
[1:25:17] types
[1:25:18] he said now i got one more
[1:25:21] he said on the eighth day holy
[1:25:23] convocation
[1:25:25] he said that's past time
[1:25:29] that's not the millennium the millennium
[1:25:32] is not to us
[1:25:34] our home is the eighth day
[1:25:38] future home and it won't be future then
[1:25:41] it'll be the present day the present day
[1:25:45] place i'm gonna live
[1:25:47] not just a temporary dwelling like it
[1:25:50] was described in there
[1:25:52] so now let's go back to exodus just for
[1:25:55] a minute
[1:25:56] if you don't mind give me just a second
[1:25:59] the three feasts go away the very end
[1:26:02] brother joe thank you
[1:26:04] they do an excellent job back there
[1:26:07] three times
[1:26:08] thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the
[1:26:09] year now remember all the males have to
[1:26:11] go
[1:26:11] be just about four minutes all right
[1:26:14] three times thou shalt keep a feast of
[1:26:15] me in the year thou shalt keep the feast
[1:26:17] of unleavened bread
[1:26:20] thou shall eat unleavened bread seven
[1:26:21] days as i commanded them the time of
[1:26:23] point of the month abib which is nissan
[1:26:25] for in that thou camest out from egypt
[1:26:27] and none shall appear before me
[1:26:29] empty and the feast of harvest the first
[1:26:32] fruits of thy labor which is the feast
[1:26:33] of weeks
[1:26:34] which is pentecost which thou has sown
[1:26:37] in thy field
[1:26:38] and the feast of end gathering which is
[1:26:39] what the feast of tabernacles
[1:26:42] which is at the end of the year when
[1:26:43] thou has gathered in thy labors out of
[1:26:45] the field three times in the year all
[1:26:47] thy males
[1:26:48] shall appear before the lord all right
[1:26:50] let's read the next one deuteronomy
[1:26:53] three times in a year shall all thy
[1:26:55] males appear before the lord thy god in
[1:26:56] the place which he shall choose
[1:26:58] and the feast of unleavened bread and
[1:27:00] the feast of weeks and the feast of
[1:27:01] tabernacles
[1:27:02] they shall not appear before the lord
[1:27:04] empty what have all three
[1:27:06] got in common
[1:27:10] number one it's a harvest
[1:27:15] okay all right now remember you say oh
[1:27:17] no unleavened bread but now remember
[1:27:19] your unleavened bread is heading toward
[1:27:23] the uh feast of first fruit feast of
[1:27:26] weeks is what
[1:27:27] wheat harvest and the feast of
[1:27:29] tabernacles
[1:27:31] fruit harvest that's why the
[1:27:34] the people the boys couldn't come to the
[1:27:37] tibet or couldn't come to
[1:27:39] israel or jerusalem empty-handed they
[1:27:42] all
[1:27:42] had to bring something that they planted
[1:27:47] in their field
[1:27:51] and it could be bananas
[1:27:54] oranges wheat during wheat harvest
[1:27:59] but you got it out of your field
[1:28:03] and you brought it to the lord
[1:28:07] as you were able some
[1:28:11] brought virtue some brought knowledge
[1:28:15] some brought temperance patience
[1:28:16] godliness brother kindness all the way
[1:28:18] up to the capstone
[1:28:19] now everybody's not going to bring the
[1:28:21] same
[1:28:24] but it's the fruit of your harvest
[1:28:28] is what you bring to god now what's the
[1:28:31] second thing
[1:28:32] and we'll be done what's the second
[1:28:34] thing that they all three have in common
[1:28:39] i'm gonna just wait a minute
[1:28:47] they are all seven day
[1:28:51] feast
[1:28:54] feast of unleavened breads how long
[1:28:57] seven day
[1:29:00] feast of weeks seven times seven
[1:29:03] but remember the feast of tabernacles
[1:29:07] was a seven day feast
[1:29:08] but every one of them
[1:29:11] has an eighth day involved
[1:29:15] every one of them you say oh no no feast
[1:29:16] of my love of bread remember you forgot
[1:29:18] passover
[1:29:19] what makes this an eight day feast oh
[1:29:22] wait a minute now feast of weeks
[1:29:24] seven sevens is 49 that extra day
[1:29:27] makes it an eight and the feast of
[1:29:30] tabernacles oh we know that
[1:29:32] is an eighth day holy convocation you
[1:29:35] all
[1:29:36] every time that you brought something
[1:29:39] you brought it into eternity
[1:29:44] you brought what you brought your fruit
[1:29:47] you were bringing it for a seven-day
[1:29:48] feast but you were there for eight
[1:29:50] days
[1:29:54] every man what head of the house the man
[1:29:58] the male nothing to say against the
[1:30:00] females but the man's the head of the
[1:30:01] house god's a man
[1:30:03] all right so in symbolics what do we do
[1:30:05] as christians
[1:30:06] not three times a year
[1:30:10] i hope you can church more than that but
[1:30:12] three times in the year
[1:30:14] they were supposed to bring what they
[1:30:17] had
[1:30:18] planted in their field took
[1:30:21] it in and brought it
[1:30:24] and they would go seven days and then
[1:30:27] they'd go one extra day
[1:30:30] proving there was an eternity
[1:30:34] proving that you and i are heading
[1:30:36] toward
[1:30:37] an eternity oh yeah we're already
[1:30:40] eternal in our soul
[1:30:42] but this thing is still in a seven
[1:30:47] we got to take the fruit that we harvest
[1:30:51] and we got to take it and step into that
[1:30:53] eighth day
[1:30:55] the holy convocation that every male
[1:30:59] was required every year and there's many
[1:31:01] times and i'll go
[1:31:02] and i'll not get into it if you want to
[1:31:03] look at the history of it many times
[1:31:06] jesus came up to many feasts and a lot
[1:31:09] of them were the one of the three feasts
[1:31:11] because remember on the feast of
[1:31:12] pentecost they stand to our feet
[1:31:14] and musicians come on the feast of
[1:31:17] pentecost
[1:31:18] is where they lost jesus well that was
[1:31:21] one of the that was one of the three
[1:31:23] feasts that the males
[1:31:25] had to come to and where did they find
[1:31:28] him
[1:31:29] they found him three days later
[1:31:32] but they had to go back to where he left
[1:31:34] him
[1:31:36] pentecost never went back and found him
[1:31:38] under justification sanctification of
[1:31:40] baptism and holy ghost
[1:31:41] they never made that three-day journey
[1:31:43] back brother brown said i read the quote
[1:31:44] to you brother brown said they lost him
[1:31:46] at the day of pentecost
[1:31:50] they never stepped in to the eighth day
[1:31:53] they stayed in that old seven day feast
[1:31:56] and you know what that's okay for the
[1:31:59] pentecostals of that day
[1:32:02] because that was the message that was
[1:32:03] the trumpet that was the trump that
[1:32:05] sounded
[1:32:06] but today that won't work today speaking
[1:32:09] in tongues shouting
[1:32:10] that's fine that's good that's okay but
[1:32:13] you got to go through justification
[1:32:15] sanctification in the baptism of the
[1:32:16] holy ghost to receive
[1:32:19] the new birth
[1:32:23] that was kind of strange though seven
[1:32:25] feasts those three feasts that were
[1:32:27] required
[1:32:28] had a seven day period and then they had
[1:32:30] to step into one more day
[1:32:33] that's you and i we're required to bring
[1:32:35] what we have folks
[1:32:36] we're required to bring what we have and
[1:32:39] bring it what to the storehouse
[1:32:42] and what does that do that keeps us here
[1:32:45] for the eighth day
[1:32:47] now you skip a day or two it's not the
[1:32:49] eighth day
[1:32:52] i said what do you mean by the way well
[1:32:54] you know what
[1:32:56] run it through your head how many times
[1:32:59] you study read the bible like brother
[1:33:01] bob said you know what do you put in
[1:33:02] front of god
[1:33:08] brother brown said you can't wait for
[1:33:09] the doors to open to come to church
[1:33:13] and we just don't open them in the
[1:33:14] morning
[1:33:18] i'm just telling you what the bible says
[1:33:22] i'm just telling you what the bible says
[1:33:26] maybe that's why we have a lot of
[1:33:27] problems sometimes because we don't do
[1:33:28] what god tells us today
[1:33:32] oh what fruit are we bringing
[1:33:36] are we bringing it just at one feast and
[1:33:38] then not bringing it to all of them
[1:33:40] listen they were required all males in
[1:33:44] israel were required or they were cut
[1:33:46] off for the whole year
[1:33:47] they were required to come to them three
[1:33:49] feasts
