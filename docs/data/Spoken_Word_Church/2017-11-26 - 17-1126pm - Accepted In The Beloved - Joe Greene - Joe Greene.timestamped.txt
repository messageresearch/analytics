[20:35] [Music]
[20:55] only holy holy holy holy holy want to
[21:06] see
[21:06] [Music]
[21:10] do you really want to see in this
[21:12] evening a man god bless you have your
[21:15] seat for just a moment like to share
[21:17] something with you
[21:18] just before we go to the word this
[21:20] evening and the all musicians I'm not a
[21:23] singer so I won't try to do that tonight
[21:26] I came across this little note little
[21:34] thought from Spurgeon and I hope that's
[21:36] okay
[21:38] he says that a book is the expression of
[21:42] the thoughts of the writer the book of
[21:46] nature is an expression of the thoughts
[21:48] of God he said we have God's terrible
[21:52] thoughts in the thunder and lightning
[21:54] God's loving thoughts in the sunshine
[21:57] and the balmy breeze God's bounteous
[22:02] bounteous prudent careful thoughts in
[22:05] the waving harvest in the ripening
[22:08] meadow said we have God's brilliant
[22:11] thoughts in the wondrous scenes which
[22:14] are beheld from the mountain top and the
[22:16] valley and we have God's most sweet and
[22:19] present thoughts of beauty in the little
[22:22] flowers that blossom at our feet but you
[22:26] will remark that God has in nature given
[22:30] most prominence to those thoughts that
[22:33] needed to have preeminence he has not
[22:37] given us broad acres over spread with
[22:39] flowers for they were not needed in such
[22:42] abundance but he has spread forth the
[22:45] fields with corn that thus the absolute
[22:48] necessities of life might be supplied he
[22:53] said we needed most of the thoughts of
[22:55] his Providence and he hath quickened our
[23:00] industry so that God's providential care
[23:02] may be read as we ride along the
[23:05] roadside on every side now God's book of
[23:09] grace is just like his book of nature it
[23:12] is his thoughts written out this great
[23:16] book the Bible this most precious volume
[23:19] is the heart of God made legible
[23:21] it is the gold of God's love beaten out
[23:24] into leaf gold so that there with our
[23:29] thoughts might be played in and we also
[23:32] might have golden good and holy thoughts
[23:35] concerning him and you will mark that as
[23:38] in nature so in grace the most necessary
[23:41] is the most prominent I see in God's
[23:45] Word a rich abundance of flowers of
[23:48] glorious eloquence often I find a
[23:52] prophet marshalling his words like
[23:53] armies for might and like kings for
[23:56] majesty but far more frequently I read
[24:00] simple declarations of truths I see here
[24:04] there here and there a brilliant thought
[24:06] of beauty but I find whole fields of
[24:10] plain didactic doctrine that's doctrine
[24:14] that will help you and instruct you amen
[24:17] he said which is food for the Soul and I
[24:21] find whole chapters full of Christ which
[24:24] is divine manna
[24:25] whereon the soul doth feed I see starry
[24:29] words to make the Scriptures brilliant
[24:32] sweet thoughts to make them fare great
[24:36] thoughts to make them impressive
[24:38] terrible thoughts to make them awful but
[24:41] necessary thoughts instructive thoughts
[24:46] saving thoughts are far more frequent
[24:49] because far more necessary here and
[24:53] there a bed of flowers but broad acres
[24:56] of living corn of the gospel of the
[24:58] grace of God you must excuse me then he
[25:01] said if I very frequently dwell on the
[25:04] whole topic of salvation he said last
[25:08] Sabbath I brought you one shock of the
[25:09] wit this week in the fashion of Christ's
[25:12] promise which says he that calleth on
[25:14] the name of the Lord shall be saved
[25:16] and then I sought to show how men might
[25:19] be saved I bring you another bring you
[25:22] now another shot cut down in the
[25:24] self-same field
[25:25] teaching you the great philosophy of
[25:28] salvation the hidden mystery this the
[25:31] great secret the wonderful discovery
[25:34] which is brought to light by
[25:35] the gospel how God is just and yet the
[25:40] justifier of the ungodly let us read the
[25:43] text again and then it once proceeded to
[25:45] discuss it he said I intend to do today
[25:49] as an in last Sunday I shall be just as
[25:52] simple as ever I can and I shall not
[25:55] attempt one single flight of eloquence
[25:58] or oratory even if I am capable of it
[26:02] but just go along the ground so that
[26:04] every simple soul may be able to
[26:07] understand for he hath made him to be
[26:10] sin for us who knew no sin that we might
[26:15] be made the righteousness of God in him
[26:18] now I don't know what to think about
[26:20] that but I think that is lovely tonight
[26:22] amen and it's just a wonderful
[26:25] expression a wonderful thought that God
[26:28] has given us this evening and you know
[26:31] when we look at what God has done and
[26:33] and the message that he's given us in
[26:36] this hour and how that Grace has been
[26:42] expounded upon because we realize each
[26:46] one of us is seeming that without the
[26:48] grace of God without the grace of God
[26:51] you know sometimes we go down the street
[26:53] and we see somebody maybe ungodly
[26:55] dressed or doing ungodly things and we
[26:57] think my my what a condition but then we
[27:01] have to stop and think if it weren't for
[27:03] the grace of God there go I a man you
[27:07] know brother Branham had the the thought
[27:10] of you know leaving the ministry and
[27:12] going going to the mountains and not so
[27:15] much leaving the ministry I guess but
[27:17] just come out when the Lord would give
[27:18] him a word you know thus saith the Lord
[27:21] he'd come out and delivered and then he
[27:22] go back to the woods and and live his
[27:24] life there but you know the Lord opened
[27:27] his eyes and opened his understanding
[27:29] and let him see the old man there that
[27:31] favored him and you know I was old beard
[27:34] and scraggly looking fella and the Lord
[27:37] began to tell him if you do that you'll
[27:39] lose your wife you'll lose your family
[27:40] and all those things and and he began to
[27:43] realise if it wasn't for the grace of
[27:45] God there I would be a man so
[27:48] this evening we we want to look at the
[27:51] Word of God again and feel stand with me
[27:54] tonight and open to the book of
[27:55] Ephesians praise the Lord praise the
[28:02] Lord again it's just a real privilege to
[28:06] be here with you tonight and try to
[28:08] share something from the Word of God
[28:10] that would maybe help you along the way
[28:12] and be a blessing to you and that's we
[28:16] have nothing of our self as a minister
[28:19] we don't bring a revival or stirring in
[28:21] our pocket
[28:21] it's only by the grace of God tonight
[28:25] that that he gives us anything a man
[28:31] it's by His grace before we read tonight
[28:33] we just like to pray again and ask his
[28:35] blessings Heavenly Father God we're so
[28:38] grateful and so thankful this evening
[28:40] for your love and your mercy and your
[28:42] grace that you have shed abroad in our
[28:45] hearts and God we realize that without
[28:48] you tonight Lord we are nothing the Lord
[28:51] it's by your grace and by what you have
[28:54] done for us tonight Lord that we can
[28:56] recognize our position as the body of
[28:59] Christ we can recognize Lord that you
[29:02] have chosen us in you before the
[29:05] foundation of the world and you have you
[29:07] have made us meet to be partakers of
[29:10] this glorious gospel that you have seen
[29:14] this glorious salvation god I pray
[29:16] tonight your blessings upon this
[29:17] assembly but there Salman brother Wade
[29:20] and all the other brothers that labor
[29:22] with them all the layouts you lord
[29:24] the congregation as a whole Lord I know
[29:27] they love you with all their heart I
[29:29] know they want to serve you god I pray
[29:31] that you just strengthen each one with
[29:34] with that desire Lord and may it ever
[29:36] grow stronger in their lives may it
[29:38] never wane may it never falter but Lord
[29:41] until the coming of your son the Lord
[29:43] Jesus our Savior God made that desire
[29:46] and that burden grow stronger and
[29:48] stronger each day
[29:49] help us Lord every one to stand against
[29:52] the wiles of the wicked one and and be
[29:55] victorious in this hour so we thank you
[29:58] for these things now take the vessel
[29:59] this evening Lord move the men aside
[30:01] maybe
[30:02] speak through lips of clay and help us
[30:04] Lord to hear through the ears of
[30:07] understanding and and revelation tonight
[30:10] God that your word can become a living
[30:12] reality in our heart we thank you for
[30:15] these things bless the service again at
[30:17] home tonight in Jesus Christ's name we
[30:19] pray amen
[30:21] reading this evening in first Ephesians
[30:25] chapter 1 and read verse 6 and we'll let
[30:28] you have your seats
[30:29] tonight and the writer wrote this he
[30:32] said to the praise of the glory of His
[30:36] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[30:40] in the beloved a man may the Lord at his
[30:45] blessings to the reading of the word
[30:46] this evening as you have your seats
[30:48] again we're just thrilled and happy to
[30:52] to be a part of God's great plan and
[30:56] happy and thrilled to be here with you
[30:58] and again we certainly appreciate the
[31:00] what warm welcome and invitation to come
[31:04] and fellowship with you today amen you
[31:07] know in in ourselves we think well what
[31:10] can I say what can I do but it's not
[31:12] what we can do but it's what he has done
[31:14] for us tonight amen
[31:16] so we look here and we realized the
[31:20] reason we're here tonight is because of
[31:23] the grace of God we realized this
[31:25] evening that as we said at the winding
[31:28] up this morning that he has chosen us
[31:31] and he has called us this evening for a
[31:34] purpose a man and and it's not our
[31:37] purpose but it's his purpose amen all
[31:40] things work together for the good of
[31:43] them that loved the Lord to them who are
[31:45] called according to his purpose and we
[31:49] realized that grace this evening is
[31:51] God's unmerited favor upon our lives in
[31:55] the way that we live and do and it's
[31:58] divine influence upon our hearts tonight
[32:01] that is reflected in the way that we
[32:03] live we act and we do and it has been
[32:06] termed God's unmerited favor now there's
[32:11] not a one of us sitting or standing here
[32:13] tonight that deserves God's favor
[32:16] we don't deserve it this morning because
[32:18] as we said we were born in sin shapen in
[32:21] iniquity as we come into the world
[32:22] speaking lies amen and we we understand
[32:27] that it's by him this evening and by His
[32:30] grace by him giving us that unmerited
[32:34] favor amen and as we as we realize and
[32:38] understand that God is His grace is God
[32:42] giving and showing favor tonight to
[32:44] someone who is completely and totally
[32:47] destitute of any merit of grace amen
[32:51] it's the bestowing of all the benefits
[32:54] of grace without any regards to one's
[32:57] goodness now god don't look at you and
[32:59] say well you're good you deserve grace
[33:01] you're not so good you don't deserve
[33:03] grace or you're this good and you
[33:05] deserve this much grace it's God giving
[33:08] you grace undeservedly tonight unmerited
[33:11] nothing you could do nothing you could
[33:14] pay a man it's nothing you could provide
[33:16] in exchange for it it's just God
[33:19] extending favor to you tonight Amen now
[33:23] it's not because you're smarter wiser
[33:24] richer or any more educated or more
[33:28] deserving or more you know more you know
[33:32] of anything to cause you to merit it
[33:36] more than anybody else because we're all
[33:37] in the same boat to not amen we're all
[33:40] without without hope except it be
[33:43] through Jesus Christ now we realize this
[33:46] evening that there's nothing we could do
[33:49] if we lived in this life 150 million
[33:52] years and each of those hundred and
[33:54] fifty million years we earned a hundred
[33:57] and fifty million dollars amen and we
[34:00] saved all those millions of dollars and
[34:02] we put it in a bank account let it grow
[34:04] interest and and accumulate an
[34:07] additional amount whenever it's all said
[34:09] and done at the hundred and fifty one
[34:11] millionth year we still wouldn't have
[34:14] enough money to by the grace of God amen
[34:17] we still wouldn't have enough resources
[34:20] we wouldn't have have done enough good
[34:21] it's not by what we have done it's what
[34:25] he has done
[34:26] Forrest is seen a man now the scripture
[34:28] tells us in first Corinthians 125 231 he
[34:32] said he said for you see your calling
[34:35] brethren how that not many wise men
[34:37] after the flesh not many mighty not many
[34:40] noble are called
[34:41] but God had chosen the foolish things of
[34:44] the world to confound the wise and God
[34:46] hath chosen the weak things of the world
[34:48] to confound the things which are mighty
[34:50] and the base things of the world and
[34:53] things which are despised hath God
[34:55] chosen yes yea and things which are not
[34:59] to bring to nought things that are that
[35:02] no flesh should glory in his presence
[35:06] but of him
[35:08] are you in Christ Jesus of who God who
[35:11] of God is made unto us wisdom and
[35:14] righteousness and sanctification and
[35:17] redemption that according as it has
[35:19] written he that glorious let him glory
[35:23] in the Lord so we realized tonight that
[35:25] all glory belongs to God any good in you
[35:29] it only comes from God tonight it's not
[35:33] you being good but it's God in you now
[35:36] you know you look and you see people and
[35:39] you know you deal with people all the
[35:40] time and and you know you have some
[35:43] people that that are just plumb ugly so
[35:47] to speak they just never have a good
[35:49] thing to say they they're never happy
[35:51] they're never never settle in peace they
[35:54] have nothing amen and I want you to
[35:57] realize tonight if it weren't for God in
[35:59] your life you would be right there with
[36:01] them
[36:02] amen well brother Joe I'm an easygoing
[36:04] person I don't get upset too easy and
[36:07] all of that
[36:07] amen that may be true tonight but still
[36:10] without the grace of God in your life
[36:12] you'd be just like them amen that you
[36:15] you'd be in such a condition Amen that
[36:18] nobody would want to be around you you
[36:21] know maybe y'all don't have those kind
[36:23] of people in Georgia either that you
[36:25] just don't like to be around but then
[36:29] there's some people that my you just
[36:31] can't wait to get in their presence
[36:33] because you know that they are always
[36:35] going to be positive I know but the Sam
[36:37] is that way and when we have talked
[36:39] on the phone a couple times and
[36:41] arranging coming down and so forth and
[36:44] yesterday just to get the details worked
[36:47] out and you know when I asked him how
[36:49] you doing he said I'm always doing good
[36:50] I'm always feeling good I'm always just
[36:54] wonderfully man and I like that
[36:56] sometimes people ask me so how you doing
[36:58] I said well I'm doing good so good if I
[37:00] was any better I'd be twice as good in
[37:02] the world couldn't stand two of me
[37:04] amen so I'm doing good hey man so you
[37:06] know we've got to make a positive
[37:09] confession tonight because we do you
[37:12] realize we're little creators this
[37:14] evening brother madam told us that we
[37:17] have the ability to create a world and
[37:19] go live on it
[37:20] amen but I believe we can create a world
[37:23] right here and go live in it well how's
[37:26] that brother Joe by what you say amen by
[37:30] abide the words of your mouth because
[37:32] you are little creators tonight amen you
[37:35] know people will always want to to look
[37:38] at the downside of life well I you know
[37:40] how you're doing brother well you know I
[37:42] got up this morning this was hurtin that
[37:44] was certain this was broke that's going
[37:45] wrong this is happening over there and
[37:47] that's bad over yonder and that's seen
[37:49] you know what you're doing you're just
[37:51] projecting a bad attitude well let me
[37:56] just preach a little while tonight if
[37:58] that's all right
[37:59] amen we we this evening by the words of
[38:03] our mouths we are justified and by the
[38:06] words of our mouth we are condemned
[38:07] tonight amen now we can speak positive
[38:12] we can speak blessings or we can speak
[38:15] cursings amen but because we're sons and
[38:18] daughters of God we speak good things we
[38:21] speak positive things amen because we
[38:23] with there there's nothing in as we call
[38:25] it except Christ and Christ is good
[38:27] tonight so out of the abundance of our
[38:30] heart the mouth speaketh this evening
[38:32] amen so we go for it when they ask you
[38:34] how you doing I'm doing wonderful
[38:36] amen I'm the best I've ever been I'm
[38:39] happy I'm joyful I got the Lord in my
[38:41] life amen he's good to me and and I've
[38:44] got my little cap over there in the
[38:46] office he said God is good all the time
[38:48] God
[38:49] is good amen so I just you know I find
[38:53] myself many times you know looking at
[38:55] people and whenever you say things to
[38:57] them like that they kind of look at you
[38:58] sort of crossways and funny and they say
[39:00] well you know look at the condition
[39:02] you're in as I said this morning I'm not
[39:04] looking at the condition I'm looking at
[39:06] the conclusion and I know beyond a doubt
[39:09] and all of this is laid down amen there
[39:12] is therefore laid up for me a crown of
[39:14] righteousness
[39:15] amen in this old body that's that's
[39:17] getting a little older and getting
[39:19] little problems here and there and
[39:21] losing it sight losing its hair and
[39:23] losing this and losing that losing it
[39:25] strength
[39:26] thank God one day I'm gonna lay this one
[39:28] down and step into one that will never
[39:30] get tired anymore
[39:32] it'll never lose its hair it'll never
[39:34] lose its strength Amen it will be an
[39:36] eternal body Amen that's prepared in the
[39:39] heavens just for me I want to tell you
[39:41] you can't take my place you might want
[39:45] to but you came because it's prepared
[39:47] just for me
[39:49] amen oh why did God save you this
[39:54] evening was there anything in you that
[39:57] caused him to do it
[40:00] what Act did you perform that caused God
[40:04] to say I want to save this brother
[40:07] nothing
[40:09] amen what goodness did you demonstrate
[40:12] that move him to redeem you there was
[40:15] nothing amen there was no reason why he
[40:19] should have chosen you and listen he
[40:21] didn't just choose you you know the old
[40:23] song says I a new name and glory was
[40:26] written down the night I got saved well
[40:28] that song is a lie Amen because when I
[40:32] got saved it was before the foundation
[40:34] of the world
[40:35] I might have accepted on Friday night
[40:38] June the third or fourth right along in
[40:41] there 1974 I might have realized it and
[40:44] accepting what God had done for me but I
[40:47] want you to know it the mind of God I
[40:48] was saying before the foundation of the
[40:50] world and
[40:52] so were you this cement a man it wasn't
[40:54] on a Friday night or a Monday night or a
[40:57] Sunday night or Sunday morning it was
[40:59] before the foundation of the world your
[41:01] name was written in the Lamb's Book of
[41:03] Life
[41:04] amen and all you had to do is catch up
[41:06] to that reality this evening and let it
[41:09] become real into your life tonight now
[41:12] the scripture said here to the praise of
[41:14] the glory of His grace wherein he hath
[41:19] made us accepted in the beloved now the
[41:23] Greek word there translated accepted
[41:25] it's used only one other time in the
[41:27] scriptures and that's found in Luke
[41:28] chapter one verse 28 and the angel came
[41:32] in unto her and said hey o thou that art
[41:36] highly favoured or accepted and the Lord
[41:40] is with thee blessed art thou among
[41:43] women now I would like to bring that up
[41:45] to our date this evening Amen hail thou
[41:48] that art highly favoured or accepted of
[41:52] God
[41:53] listen amen Mary didn't have not one
[41:55] thing to do with it brother Branham
[41:57] described as maybe her and Joseph were
[41:59] reading the the scrolls together and
[42:01] just going over the prophecies of Isaiah
[42:03] amen have read the scripture there where
[42:05] it said behold the Virgin shall conceive
[42:07] and you know maybe something just moved
[42:09] over her and and she was just thinking
[42:11] wow what wouldn't what a glorious thing
[42:14] that God is going to do he's going to
[42:16] come down amen and and be born in and a
[42:21] little baby and and B being become a
[42:23] child and this legend is going to bring
[42:25] forth a child never knowing a man now
[42:28] can you imagine the thoughts that must
[42:30] have went through their mind
[42:31] amen as they just mulled over and Heist
[42:34] over those thoughts and then the next
[42:36] morning as brother Branham described it
[42:38] going down to the will a meant to get
[42:40] the water for for the home there and as
[42:43] she was going around the corner there
[42:45] stood Gabriel the mighty angel and said
[42:47] Hail Mary thou wert highly favored of
[42:50] God well I want to tell you this evening
[42:52] saints of God amen we not a bit might
[42:54] not have gone down to the whale but in
[42:56] this generation there has been a mighty
[42:58] angel amen that's come down once again
[43:00] and said hail
[43:02] bride you're highly favorite of God and
[43:05] that which will be conceived in you is
[43:08] all the holy ghost tonight amen and you
[43:10] will bring forth the Son of God afresh
[43:13] in this hour
[43:14] Amen what am i favored people we are and
[43:18] as I said that word favored I accepted
[43:21] they men accepted in the beloved this
[43:24] evening not in our merits but what he
[43:26] has done for us tonight amen what a what
[43:31] a blessed thought that he is our
[43:33] accepting acceptance rather it's not
[43:37] future tense
[43:38] he's right now Amen it's not it's not
[43:43] something that's going to be it is an
[43:45] accomplished fact tonight Amen it's
[43:49] already done I have to do this it's a
[44:04] beautiful illustration let me see I
[44:08] can't see
[44:09] I got a $20 bill I'm gonna give it to
[44:16] somebody now the choice is mine and
[44:21] there's nobody here that's done anything
[44:23] for it there's nobody here that well you
[44:28] might think you deserve it but you know
[44:30] it's not up to you it's my choice all
[44:35] right let's see who am I gonna give it
[44:37] to tonight is it Thomas Tommy Thomas
[44:46] would you come and get this $20 bill
[44:51] okay
[44:56] go buy you some ice cream or something
[44:58] okay now you see how easy it is to get
[45:09] something from God he believed I was
[45:15] going to give it to him and God has
[45:18] already told us what he has done for us
[45:20] and what he has given us and all we've
[45:23] got to do is like Thomas get up out of
[45:26] our seed of doubt and confusion and say
[45:28] Lord you said it I'm gonna take it for
[45:31] myself it's mine tonight now I've used
[45:34] that illustration quite a few times and
[45:36] a lot of times the kids with Sam they'll
[45:38] look at mama really yeah they're looking
[45:42] daddy is he gonna give me that if I go
[45:44] up there you know with that kind of a
[45:46] mentality and you know what to do they
[45:48] set there many times long enough to well
[45:50] I said all right you're not gonna come
[45:52] all right I'm gonna pick somebody else
[45:53] and that's exactly tonight what God does
[45:57] if we sit there in our seat and say well
[45:59] I'm not sure God goes and find somebody
[46:02] else that will accept his word and it
[46:05] gives them the benefit of that tonight
[46:07] Amen so that illustration works anyway
[46:10] it comes out tonight amen but you know
[46:13] we have got to come to the place to
[46:15] where we realize God has said it God
[46:18] will do what he said he will do
[46:21] Amen it's up to us tonight to take him
[46:23] at his word and receive what he said
[46:28] amen now the scripture tells us in
[46:32] Jeremiah 31 and 3 said the Lord appeared
[46:35] of old unto me saying yea I have loved
[46:38] thee with an everlasting love therefore
[46:41] with loving-kindness have i drawn thee
[46:45] now a lot of people say well I sought
[46:47] the Lord and I sought the Lord but I
[46:49] want you to realize take it all the way
[46:51] back to the book of Genesis amen man
[46:53] does not seek God God seeks out man when
[46:57] Adam and Eve were hiding themselves
[46:59] because sin came into the picture God
[47:02] said Adam
[47:03] madam where art thou he meant God salt
[47:06] man but man does not see God because man
[47:10] a man is full of sin in himself amen in
[47:14] that regard tonight now I know we pray
[47:16] and we call out to God but in that
[47:18] measure are looking for God when we're
[47:20] in sin tonight we don't go looking for
[47:23] him he comes seeking us out tonight amen
[47:27] and I'm so glad that he did well maybe
[47:31] the rest of you'll catch that revelation
[47:33] after a while I'm so glad that he did
[47:35] come seeking me amen because I needed a
[47:39] savior tonight I needed a redeemer
[47:41] I needed somebody that couldn't pay the
[47:44] price that I couldn't pay I needed
[47:47] somebody amen not only that could pay
[47:49] the price but was willing to pay the
[47:52] price
[47:52] amen we look at Ruth in the Old
[47:55] Testament and there was a nearer kinsman
[47:57] a man that could have redeemed her which
[48:01] we realized tonight a man in our
[48:03] standpoint it's the devil amen he could
[48:06] have redeemed us he had a claim on us
[48:08] amen but because they met at Woodmoor
[48:12] his testimony it would mess up his
[48:14] program he couldn't do it tonight but
[48:17] all thank God Boaz he reached them he
[48:20] said I'm willing I'm able and I will
[48:23] this evening and our boy ask the Lord
[48:25] Jesus amen he was we're ready willing
[48:28] and able and he has redeemed us tonight
[48:31] out of the pawnshop of sin amen now the
[48:36] scripture tells us in John 15 9 as the
[48:38] father hath loved me so ever I loved you
[48:42] continue you in my love so tonight we're
[48:46] continuing in the love of God and
[48:49] allowing that love to express through us
[48:51] this evening now I wants to consider
[48:53] something found in Hebrews chapter 7 7
[48:56] to 10 and without all the without all
[49:00] contradiction the less is blessed of the
[49:03] better and here men that die receive
[49:06] tithes but there he receiveth them of
[49:10] whom it is witnessed that he liveth and
[49:12] as I may so say Levi also received
[49:16] tithes
[49:16] eight times in Abraham for he was yet in
[49:19] the Lords of his father when Melchizedek
[49:21] met him now when I asked you the
[49:23] question do you think that Levi
[49:26] literally physically paid tithes to
[49:30] Melchizedek when he wasn't even born no
[49:35] not physically not literally but it was
[49:38] imputed to him it was laid to his
[49:42] account if you will a man he never
[49:44] actually a man paid tithes but he was in
[49:48] his father Abraham a man and in him he
[49:52] paid tithes to Melchizedek now listen
[49:55] tonight we never paid the debt of sin
[49:57] yet it's credited to our account this
[50:00] evening amen because he he Levi was in
[50:05] the loins of Abraham we were in the
[50:07] loins of the Lord Jesus tonight we were
[50:10] in him when he died on Calvary we were
[50:13] in him when he died before the
[50:15] foundation of the world in the mind of
[50:16] God
[50:17] so therefore in him amen we have been
[50:21] accepted all the Lord tonight amen now
[50:25] we look at that and we realized Amen
[50:29] that that that gives us dying grace
[50:32] tonight to realize that we have been
[50:34] accepting not wondering Amen will they
[50:37] accept me when I stand before him on
[50:40] that great day he has already accepted
[50:43] me praise the Lord
[50:48] he has already accepted me this evening
[50:51] like the the worshiper in the Old
[50:55] Testament he had to bring his lamb or
[50:57] his turtle dove and he had to identify
[50:58] with that lamb and I know you've been
[51:00] told all these things but you haven't
[51:02] heard it from me so just listen tonight
[51:04] amen he he had to identify brother Sam
[51:07] lay his hands up on the head of that
[51:09] lamb as the priest slit his throat and
[51:11] the blood ran out what was he doing he
[51:14] was saying this lamb is dying in my
[51:17] stead tonight his blood is pouring out
[51:20] that should be my blood but thank God
[51:23] there is a substitute tonight and I want
[51:25] to realize we have a substitute his
[51:28] blood spilled on Calvary and we identify
[51:32] with him we lay our hands upon his head
[51:34] and upon the finished work of Calvary
[51:36] tonight and because of that we are
[51:38] already accepted in the beloved this
[51:42] evening amen now I may be poor but I'm
[51:52] accepted in the beloved
[51:53] I may be uneducated but I'm accepted in
[51:57] the beloved I may be crippled up but I
[52:00] am accepted tonight in the beloved I may
[52:03] be blind but I am accepted this evening
[52:05] in Christ Jesus amen when death comes
[52:08] knocking on your door ready to do it's
[52:10] worse
[52:11] you tell him Amen I fear you not death
[52:14] because I know
[52:15] Amen that I have been redeemed I have
[52:18] been accepted in the beloved amen and
[52:21] I've got nothing to worry about because
[52:23] he took my place he took my sins up on
[52:27] him tonight and he paid the price that I
[52:30] couldn't pay so death come on and take
[52:33] me home what what does that do to a
[52:36] child of God it just carries you into
[52:39] the presence of God we as believers we
[52:43] we shouldn't fear death all we fear the
[52:47] unknown what's it like what's going to
[52:49] happen what what what what kind of pain
[52:51] is it going to be you know sister Dow
[52:53] we've heard sister Dow by the DAO sister
[52:56] Dow undertakes brother Dan asked her
[52:58] talk to her sister Dowell sits you
[53:01] talked to brother Branham and she'd
[53:02] asked brother Branham said brother
[53:04] Branham what's it gonna be like when the
[53:06] rapture takes place and brother Bentham
[53:08] she said brother Bentham told her said
[53:10] well sister Gladys said when the rapture
[53:12] takes place because this old flesh
[53:15] cannot inherit eternal life this place
[53:18] has to die so it will be like a quick
[53:22] sharp pain and it'll be over with don't
[53:28] get quiet on me now
[53:30] because this flash has to be changed it
[53:34] has to die because why it was born in
[53:37] sin shapen iniquity conceived coming to
[53:39] the world speaking lies amen so it
[53:41] cannot eternal inherit eternal life
[53:44] there has to be a change he men and all
[53:47] I'm so glad a man that there is one
[53:49] already prepared for me tonight a man
[53:52] that when this one is done away with
[53:54] there's one I can step right into this
[53:56] evening and it's a glorious body
[53:58] fashioned like unto his glorious body
[54:01] tonight
[54:01] amen now we are manifested examples of
[54:08] the grace of God this evening in our
[54:10] lives living examples of God's grace now
[54:16] I don't know you like I know me but you
[54:21] don't know me like you know you and you
[54:26] know where you came from and you know
[54:29] the road you was traveling on and you
[54:33] know where you were headed
[54:34] now you know a lot of people look at me
[54:37] and say brother Joel you never went out
[54:40] in the world I was raised in church
[54:42] since I was a little bitty baby you
[54:44] never went out in the world you never
[54:46] drank you never smoked done all those
[54:48] things that a lot of people do but you
[54:52] know what I was just as lost as anybody
[54:54] else
[54:55] amen I was just as on my road to hell as
[54:59] anybody was because I had not been born
[55:03] again amen but when God came into my
[55:06] life amen had changed me what was that
[55:10] it was the grace of God the unmerited
[55:13] favor of God extended to me now you may
[55:17] have been the worst drunk you may be in
[55:19] the worst drug addict you may be the
[55:20] worst this or that the other amen but it
[55:23] took no more grace for you than it did
[55:25] for me tonight the same saving grace
[55:28] amen the same grace tonight that was
[55:31] saved me
[55:32] amen born and raised in church all my
[55:34] life but yet in need of a savior Amen
[55:37] you might have been the drunk or the
[55:39] prostitute or whatever you were
[55:41] amen the drug-addict I don't know and
[55:44] and I don't want to know
[55:45] Amen but God knows and you knew Amen but
[55:49] thank God because you accepted his
[55:51] propitiation now now God don't even know
[55:54] what you were all he sees is you're a
[55:56] son or daughter of God how can he do
[55:58] that because he throws your sins in the
[56:00] sea of forgetfulness never ever ever to
[56:04] remember them against you again tonight
[56:06] Amen so when God opens the book and
[56:09] looks and that Satan comes accusing you
[56:11] and saying did you know this rather did
[56:13] that did you know that sister did that
[56:15] and God pulls up the screen you know
[56:17] what he sees a blank piece of paper a
[56:22] blank screen tonight there's nothing
[56:24] there
[56:25] Amen to accuse you of nothing there to
[56:27] condemn you of because it's all
[56:29] underneath the blood of Jesus Christ
[56:32] amen it cannot be remembered against you
[56:35] again
[56:36] amen well brother Joe how come the devil
[56:38] comes up and he showed because it's
[56:40] really his sin it's really belongs to
[56:45] him tonight and he can remember all of
[56:47] that
[56:47] amen and he brings it tries to make your
[56:50] mind Mull it over and think about it
[56:52] amen but when he comes and does that
[56:54] brother Sam what do we do we don't just
[56:56] sit there and dwell on it and and you
[56:58] know sometimes we have to fight those
[56:59] things well maybe that's the North
[57:03] Carolina thing too he comes and he
[57:07] brings those things up and you know he's
[57:09] gay he had 3d Living Color long before
[57:12] NBC did or Sony or whoever invented it
[57:15] and he brings those things up and he
[57:18] begins to roll that in your mind and you
[57:20] know the first thing you know you begin
[57:22] to oh yeah oh God and if we're not
[57:28] careful we'll let that thing begin to
[57:30] play and that's what the devil wants us
[57:32] to do right he wants to just let it keep
[57:35] playing and then you know what he's
[57:36] doing he's getting us sidetracked and
[57:39] getting us into a position to where we
[57:41] if we're not careful amen when that
[57:44] takes over our mind what are we gonna do
[57:45] we're gonna go do it again but thank God
[57:47] amen for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[57:50] tonight because when that feeling begins
[57:52] to roll you know what
[57:53] the whole egos come down and convince
[57:55] you that it says that's not you that's
[57:57] uh that's somebody else that belongs to
[58:00] the devil you have been cleared of those
[58:02] things it's not on your record it's not
[58:05] yours
[58:06] amen the screen is blank tonight and
[58:08] there's nothing there against you
[58:10] because it's been done away with by the
[58:13] blood of Jesus Christ tonight it's a
[58:20] clean slate this evening now grace makes
[58:26] the most unaccepted among men acceptable
[58:30] among the notables of heaven a redeemed
[58:34] prostitute is made higher than the
[58:36] Angels the angle is not a son of God
[58:45] they're a created being created to serve
[58:48] God to worship God to carry out his
[58:53] orders but they have never been redeemed
[58:57] amen they don't know what Amazing Grace
[59:00] how sweet the sound means tonight amen
[59:03] because they have never been lost in sin
[59:05] they have never stooped that low amen
[59:08] they are holy angels and they stand
[59:10] before God crying holy holy holy Lord
[59:12] God Almighty they don't know what it
[59:14] means to be lost and be redeemed but you
[59:17] and I do tonight amen and we buy that
[59:20] knowledge and buy that reality in our
[59:23] lives we can worship God oh how I love
[59:26] Jesus because He first loved me Amazing
[59:30] Grace how sweet the sound that saved a
[59:32] wretch like me I once was lost but now
[59:35] I'm found I was blind but thank God now
[59:38] I see and we can sing that with the
[59:41] reality because it has happened to us
[59:43] tonight amen
[59:46] but the angels they don't know nothing
[59:49] about that a drunkards name is whispered
[59:52] among the population of heaven no one
[59:55] becomes as someone all because of grace
[1:00:00] remember tonight salvation is of the
[1:00:03] Lord it's only because of God's grace
[1:00:05] that we can
[1:00:07] stand in the presence of a holy and just
[1:00:09] God unconditionally
[1:00:17] how speaking some of these things and I
[1:00:20] had the brother to lower the screen I
[1:00:22] said now turn the projector on and when
[1:00:25] he turned the projector on it was just a
[1:00:27] blank screen I said do you realize
[1:00:30] that's what the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:00:32] has done for you
[1:00:33] he has wiped it clean tonight now when
[1:00:36] they brought that lamb and they lay
[1:00:38] their hands on him and felt the the
[1:00:39] pulsation of the blood running out that
[1:00:42] life of that lamb could not come back
[1:00:45] into the believer oh but let me tell you
[1:00:48] when Jesus Christ died on Calvary his
[1:00:50] life tonight has come back on the day of
[1:00:53] Pentecost and it ends well the believer
[1:00:55] and it's been doing it to those that
[1:00:57] believe those that obey the Word of God
[1:00:59] is that life is still coming into the
[1:01:02] believers today amen because that life
[1:01:05] is in you what is it done it has driven
[1:01:07] out the very desire for sin amen and you
[1:01:10] don't desire the things that you used to
[1:01:12] desire tonight I want you to understand
[1:01:17] I smoked all I want to Oprah through Joe
[1:01:22] oh don't get excited about that I drink
[1:01:25] all the will to to I curse lie cheat and
[1:01:29] steal all I want to commit adultery
[1:01:32] all those other things all that I want
[1:01:35] to but thank God on a Friday night a
[1:01:40] long time ago something got ahold of
[1:01:43] this heart and it took the desire for
[1:01:46] those things out of me tonight and I lo
[1:01:49] longer amen have a desire to drink I no
[1:01:52] longer desire to smoke I no longer
[1:01:54] desire to do the things of the world why
[1:01:56] there has been a change in me amen and I
[1:02:00] have accepted what he has done in my
[1:02:02] life and recognized tonight it's grace
[1:02:05] grace I stand there crying grace tonight
[1:02:08] amen recognizing that in myself amen i
[1:02:11] I'm doomed I'm condemned but thank God
[1:02:14] Amen we we look
[1:02:16] on that and we recognize that he hath
[1:02:19] made us worthy this evening if you all
[1:02:26] had the faith of Abraham the seal of all
[1:02:29] the prophets all the good works of all
[1:02:32] the apostles you'd still need the grace
[1:02:34] of God amen brother Ram tells us in the
[1:02:38] visible union he said one of the books I
[1:02:41] read Oh mr. Dwight Moody that moody
[1:02:43] after reading Romans seven ran to the
[1:02:45] street and the first man he met he said
[1:02:47] to him do you know grace and the man
[1:02:50] replied grace who and mr. moody said the
[1:02:53] grace of God so it is so thrilled him
[1:02:57] when he saw or when he seen how Grace
[1:02:59] have separated us from the law and what
[1:03:03] part grace fled he said I always told
[1:03:04] the people when I crossed the line on
[1:03:06] the other side I'd like to stand up and
[1:03:08] sing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound
[1:03:10] that saved a wretch like me grace
[1:03:12] precious grace none more of grace to
[1:03:16] know for it is by grace where save not
[1:03:19] but what we can do what we can whatever
[1:03:22] we do is not accounted to us grace is
[1:03:25] what saves us it's by grace are you
[1:03:28] saved through faith
[1:03:31] it doesn't curse say that grace has made
[1:03:35] us acceptable and you know what
[1:03:38] acceptable means it'll be okay if if
[1:03:43] rather Sam and I make an agreement and
[1:03:46] and we have a contract then we have to
[1:03:49] sit down we have to iron out and bring
[1:03:52] it to a place to where both sides will
[1:03:56] accept the contract if he's gonna do a
[1:03:58] job for me he has to be willing to
[1:04:00] accept what I offer him and I have to be
[1:04:04] willing to accept that the the quality
[1:04:06] of labor which I know would be good that
[1:04:08] he would provide so that means that the
[1:04:11] contract is acceptable we can work from
[1:04:13] that amen but that's not what the
[1:04:15] scripture says the scripture says you
[1:04:17] are accepted and the word accepted means
[1:04:21] it's already completed
[1:04:25] it's already done tonight it's already a
[1:04:29] finished work Messina you have been
[1:04:32] accepted now brother Thomas back there

[1:04:38] about a $20 bill and listen he didn't

[1:04:43] of hesitated just a minute then he got
[1:04:45] on up out of his seat and come on up and
[1:04:47] he accepted what I had given it you know
[1:04:50] it would be acceptable for anybody to
[1:04:52] come amen but it wasn't given to you it
[1:04:55] was given to him tonight and God has
[1:04:58] offered it to the whole world but it's
[1:05:00] not acceptable to them they won't accept
[1:05:02] it but thank God before the foundation
[1:05:03] the world God knew that you would accept
[1:05:06] it tonight amen and they presented to
[1:05:08] you you receive it and it has changed
[1:05:11] your life this evening and giving you a
[1:05:13] new perspective and let you realize Amen

[1:05:53] him
[1:05:54] amen and by him and no one else because
[1:05:57] he alone tonight has the redemption
[1:06:00] price and can pay that price tonight
[1:06:03] through the instrument of his blood amen

[1:07:15] and let me give it to brother Joe
[1:07:17] because he has paid the price for his
[1:07:19] watch that's not how it works like

[1:07:25] if I take this book and I drop it on the
[1:07:27] floor amen and I go over here and I pick
[1:07:29] up this book and say I've redeemed that
[1:07:31] book that wouldn't be right
[1:07:33] amen I have to pick this book up and
[1:07:36] plan and lift it up and pay the price of
[1:07:39] my price to get it back with the reach
[1:07:41] down and get it
[1:07:42] amen and that's what God has done he
[1:07:44] reached further down than you could
[1:07:45] reach up tonight and he redeems you out
[1:07:48] of the pawn shop of seeing a man not
[1:07:50] another but you you were lost you were
[1:07:53] sold in the pawn shop and he had the
[1:07:56] price and he redeemed you this evening
[1:07:58] that brought you back and restored you

[1:08:21] price Amen everybody is in under the
[1:08:25] same conditions this evening Psalms 151
[1:08:29] and five said behold I was shapen in
[1:08:31] iniquity and sin did my mother conceive
[1:08:32] me
[1:08:33] I remember Redemption is through the
[1:08:37] blood
[1:08:37] not just any blood but his blood amen
[1:08:42] the blood of God which he has shared for
[1:08:45] his own church amen Romans 5 and 9 he
[1:08:51] said much more then
[1:08:53] being now justified by his blood we
[1:08:56] shall be saved from the wrath through
[1:08:59] him
[1:09:00] man now a lot of people when it comes
[1:09:04] time for communion and again this might
[1:09:08] be a North Carolina thing I'm not sure
[1:09:11] but when when it comes time for
[1:09:13] communion half the church stays home
[1:09:19] well you know like I said maybe it's a
[1:09:22] North Carolina thing and many times you
[1:09:27] talk to people why won't you come and
[1:09:29] take community enough newsflash you
[1:09:33] never will be
[1:09:37] I'm sorry to tell you you never will be
[1:09:42] well you know I've got this thing well
[1:09:46] you know how hard it is brother if I
[1:09:50] offended you I'm sorry I didn't know
[1:09:53] it's done and then what you can come to
[1:10:01] the community table I guess they had
[1:10:09] North Carolina thing but people make it
[1:10:14] so hard
[1:10:19] jesus said scripture says I should say
[1:10:23] if any man sin we have an advocate with
[1:10:26] the father Jesus Christ the righteous
[1:10:29] and that advocate you know a few years
[1:10:33] ago quite a few years ago thankfully I
[1:10:36] got a speeding ticket I was on my way to
[1:10:40] church back when I had a few sprigs of
[1:10:44] hair and I was in a car that we had just
[1:10:46] traded for and I wasn't used to it the
[1:10:48] way it's drove and handle and everything
[1:10:50] and we were on our way to church and I
[1:10:53] was gonna preach that morning wanna see
[1:10:55] him and I was kind of trying to
[1:11:00] straighten up my couple of hairs on top
[1:11:02] and and be presentable and the next
[1:11:05] thing you know I was doing
[1:11:07] let's see I think it was about 75 and a
[1:11:10] 55 more than 15 over which is not a good
[1:11:15] thing so all of a sudden I saw the blue
[1:11:18] light and heard the siren and I pulled
[1:11:21] over and the officer come up and said
[1:11:24] sir you in a hurry I said well no I'm
[1:11:27] going to church you know I just didn't
[1:11:29] realize the new car didn't realize it
[1:11:31] was speeding up like that he said okay
[1:11:33] said well now you were doing so much
[1:11:36] speed in the certain zone and he said
[1:11:39] you know he said you know I could take
[1:11:41] your license on the spot I said yes sir
[1:11:42] I realized that honest mistake I didn't
[1:11:46] mean to do it so anyway long story short
[1:11:48] I contacted a lawyer an advocate and
[1:11:54] that advocate for a price he said you
[1:11:58] won't even have to appear in court I'll
[1:12:00] handle it for you and he did I didn't
[1:12:03] have to go to the courthouse I didn't
[1:12:05] have to go and appear before the judge I
[1:12:06] didn't have to stand there and see the
[1:12:08] officer and the officer accused me and
[1:12:09] all those things my lawyer handled the
[1:12:12] case I want to change that we have an
[1:12:14] advocate and our lawyer handled the case
[1:12:17] tonight and listen we didn't have to pay
[1:12:20] him a dime he did it as an unmerited
[1:12:23] favor to you and I this evening he paid
[1:12:26] the prize he judicata the the case
[1:12:30] tonight he plead plead our cause and he
[1:12:33] made a way listen not only did he
[1:12:36] adjudicate or or plead our case he paid
[1:12:39] the fine this evening and made it so
[1:12:42] that it's not even on our record anymore
[1:12:47] amen Romans sorry we read that one
[1:12:56] Colossians 1 in 14 in whom we have
[1:12:59] redemption through his blood even the
[1:13:03] forgiveness of sins a man we have
[1:13:07] redemption and our sins are forgiven
[1:13:11] when we used to go up to brother Paget's
[1:13:14] up in the mountain brother Stewart was
[1:13:16] there and I just love to hear brother
[1:13:18] Stewart sing and he would sing just if
[1:13:22] justify I never did it in the first
[1:13:25] place justified amen
[1:13:28] and and and what does that mean it means
[1:13:30] that it's just as if I've never done it
[1:13:33] in the first place and that's the way my
[1:13:36] record looks tonight clean and white I
[1:13:38] never did it in the first place to see
[1:13:43] don't forget what brother Branham told
[1:13:45] us this evening this is what God
[1:13:49] accomplished for us way back in the
[1:13:51] eternity before the foundation of the
[1:13:54] world God laid it all out and and in his
[1:13:58] great mind listen when God first said
[1:14:02] let the earth bring forth you know what
[1:14:05] brother Joel was already justified
[1:14:08] brother Joe was already sanctified
[1:14:11] brother Joel was already glorified amen
[1:14:16] already redeemed by the blood of the
[1:14:18] Lamb well how can that be brother Joe
[1:14:21] Jesus hadn't died yet physically he
[1:14:23] hadn't but in the mind of God and I want
[1:14:26] to tell you as I stated while ago I was
[1:14:29] going to give that $20 away sometimes
[1:14:31] I'll just say that and I'll just wait on
[1:14:33] somebody to catch the revelation you saw
[1:14:40] me do that direct brother Josh's brother
[1:14:42] Joe I held it up us and I'm gonna give

[1:14:55] give this away I'm gonna give this away
[1:14:58] I'm gonna give this away and finally
[1:15:01] somebody caught the revelation and they
