========================================

thanks okay testing all right here we go so thank the Lord for bringing us through the ice storm this week right amen all right so we could all be together right right um so that's uh that's really the scripture I want to read before we kind of get into it well let's just you know what there's a lot of people sick and and uh brother Claude had a little mini stroke and and that brother Wayne was just talking about a minute ago so um let's just go to the Lord in prayer real quick and and a personal report Lord Jesus we're so thankful to you God for your grace to us Lord in this hour to open your word to us Lord and I pray God that you'll just be with us today and help us to see you more and to understand give us a greater understanding of how we should approach this topic of communion to know more of you Lord and I pray God that you'll be with all the ones that are not here today Lord credit Lord that you'll give brother to call a special touch with you just to raise him up and help us the people out there or that um the devil's attacking their Pastor Lord Jesus and I pray God that you're touching the Lord Lord I pray God that you'll have give us a special mercy and a special Grace here but a way as he goes to the overseas this this coming Wednesday Lord Jesus and just be with him and bless him the Lord Jesus bring that Lord until bless the services today we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so now the topic we've kind of been on with we've kind of run down through uh a lot of different scriptures and a lot of different things and and communion I believe is is it maybe it might seem uh parts of it deep and and uh but you know when God begins to reveal it it really becomes real simple right that's what I want to stress is that a lot of these things are are really so simple that you almost can Overlook uh it it should be it's something that's attainable it's something that God can reveal to us it's something that um is God bringing us closer to him and close fellowship with him and and that's what Ephesians chapter 5 is speaking of that the relationship between God and his church is one where what God's trying to do is he that that stone that came out of the mountain he's trying to build us up into into the privilege of that mountain it's the whole church into the reflection of of the mountains Jesus Jesus himself when he he the Bible says that he will he was in the express image of the father all right hey no nobody could know what God was like unless they looked at the sun to see what the father was like and what he looked like what what his attributes were and now God is putting himself in the into the into his people to make manifest to show the world Amen the image of the of the Unseen God now communion is is really is drawing nine to the uh under God and and and the Bible says uh you know in James chapter 4 verse 8 draw all night of God and He will draw nine of you that's right cleanse your hands you Sinners and purify your heart she double-minded because Jesus said if my hobby lifted up I'll draw all men to me and that's his purpose is to draw people to him and that's I I got to think well you know what makes a good sermon you know you can read a lot of these uh chapters and things right after this Paul starts talking about children obey your parents in the Lord and and a lot of times we get so critical of Minister that seems like they're they're bringing a real basic sermon but it's real the gospel is really is really simple and in any you know I believe that any Minister that's trying to um bring Point people to Christ right that that's really uh A good sermon a lot of times we you know my motive is not to preach something that's so far above the people that actually you know you can't hardly grasp it but just kind of to bring it down low and and um and and point everyone to God that's it now because communion is not it's not just a it's not just a you know when you when you speak about communion you you think of of joining two things together even that that story that that that uh was told that you just told in Luke chapter 16 verse 26 that of of the um the Rich Young Ruler and the uh Lazarus had died and when he went into Paradise he said between us the the rich man looked across he said there's a goal fixed between us okay there's a a great Gulf and what what God is trying to do is remove the middle wall of partition between us to bring us together and anytime you speak of communion you're really talking about joining two things you're talking about joining Christ in his church right spirit and Truth even our natural birth is really came about because of a communion between our parents and and and that's why Jesus said in John chapter 4 right after he got done when he was talking to the woman at the well right after he got done talking in John chapter three uh speaks about Nicodemus and and he was telling about the new birth and John chapter 4 he said that the hour is coming and now he is when the true worship will worship in spirit amen and truth and now all down through the Old Testament they they had the truth of the letter of the law right they had the truth and the builders that were supposed to be building the body of the of the church rejected the spirit of the real truth when it came right they they rejected that Cornerstone but so they had the the written word all down Through the Ages but now when when the spirit and Truth was going to come and be joined together they they turned it down right on the day of Pentecost the uh the Spirit came and quickened that truth that they had heard for three and a half years that's right and it was joined together and that that was real community now I I got I got to look at it uh it's amazing how all these different stories just just tie together now think about this the the statue of perfect man is building going up a ladder and in the Old Testament you remember that story that we were looking at Jacob that laid his head on a stone and he saw a ladder where the Angels were ascending and descending right now the Jews believe that that stone they they actually know where that stone was and and that's in at the Dome of the Rock where they they call it the foundation stone right and there's a uh an actual rock and it has uh over the years man has has flattened out pieces and whatnot and there's a flat now part portion of where the holy of holies in the same dimensions of the Ark of the Covenant and they believe that that's where the the holy of holies was actually on top of that foundation stone and that's the place where Jacob laid his hand because he said he put his hand on a rock on the stones right and and went to sleep and that and they call that the foundation stone now that's the the same way that the the temple was built upon that foundation stone that's the same way that the church is built upon the foundation of that that stone that came out of the mountain that stone that came out of the mountain is what you're built on where the whole church is built on and we got we were talking about and then it was rejected by the builders we were talking about this way on the way to church is it what think about how that stone fell when he was in The Garden of Gethsemane as as he right that he was about to go through with with the most difficult yeah you know I get nervous when I'm going to go on a job interview or things like that but but this was uh he knew what was going to happen he knew the the sacrifice that he was going to have to make that he was going to be stripped naked and put up on the cross and so the whole world could see him but that is the stone the foundation that the whole church is built upon the price that he paid for them I I just want to stress how how simple it is because it this this little man that that uh no man would desire and the Bible says he had no Beauty up on that cross dying and such a great profound thing in the whole world overlooked it and and that's what God is he's doing something today that thing was so simple from the outside that the whole world were overlooking that's right the world the world can't understand it and remember that what scripture we're reading Jeremiah 50 verse 2 that that Baal is confounded it confounds the the minds of the wives Improvement you can't understand it but the simple and long-learned the simple and unlearned are the ones that get it that's right and now let's see I want to read in Hebrews chapter 2. let's start at verse seven foreign oh yeah I thought I'd change it up a little bit today I think sometimes uh everybody gets a little bit tired looking at the slides or whatever so we'll do a little different I don't yeah we'll we'll make you flip the scripture make it work a little bit for yourself so Hebrews chapter 2 verse 7 says Thou mayest Tim a little lower than the angels that crowns him with glory and honor and it set him over the works of thy hands see because God starts his building in humility he took not like that that that building that the devil made starting at the head it was a head of gold trying to be all uh look at me uh right starting because yeah Power without character is satanic so the devil starts at the head and God starts a defeat in humility and begins building himself up so he he came down from glory and remember what we were just reading in Ephesians chapter five he left it all like a man that leaves father and mother and Cleaves to his wife amen now now you know a lot of times we're making we'll kind of make the excuse to try to well uh you know I'm not going to talk about that I feel a little bit sick not to say that so Dow has put all things verse eight thou has put all things in subjection under his feet everything's under his feet all power and Heaven and Earth is given under me he said everything for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things but under him we don't we don't see it yet because look at this place it's still got you know you get sick exactly getting older it's getting skin spots right it's getting uh problems in life exactly and so so he put He in that scripture we read last Sunday it is finished when he was up there on that cross and out of his side came the blood in the water and he cried it is finished and gave up his Spirit it was finished right there all right but the mechanism by which it would be complete came out of him the water and the blood and the spirit his bride came out of his side the mechanism by which we could enter back into him enter back in the community with him came out and it was manifested that rock came into the people uh on the day of Pentecost into the Believers and that word that they had heard for three and a half years was quickened so now let's go to uh First Corinthians chapter 15. verse 24. First Corinthians 15. but I will start at verse 20. but now is Christ the Risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slip for Since By Man Came Death by man came also the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order crossed the first fruits afterward they that are act they are that are Christ that is coming then come at the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the father when he shall I put down all Rule and all authority and all power and all authority and power now there's what we're talking about when we're talking about that stone that came out of the mountain and destroyed everything Babylon is not just a city but it's the work of the devil in your flesh because he mingled with his he mingled his seed with God see and he don't have a seed he's just messing around with it he's putting his own with ideas and own thoughts in the into God's word right and and that's what God is doing by the New Birth by communion with him putting down all rules and all authority and power for he must Reign he must have preeminence until he hath put all enemies under his feet The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed right before he has put all things under his feet but when he saith all things are put under him it doesn't manifest that he is accepted which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all now if you're having trouble understanding what that scripture is talking about just imagine in your mind that stone coming rolling down through the seven churches and and off down to the seven churches that that uh that uh uh that cushion Nimrod system was in trying to get in amongst the people and God is tearing that thing down Martin Luther comes out and he says now I know something that that maybe was good from the people a few hundred years ago that that just shall live by faith and that Stone's coming rolling through yes tearing it down I I we're listening to that song that they sing that it says the stone came from Battle Heaven that stone didn't come from Babylon it came from the Mountain of God but pay attention to the words and songs a lot now because it didn't come from Babylon it came rolling through and destroyed backwards extra Martin Luther and John Wesley and higher and higher until the war bird is standing there and can be anointed so that God has preeminence just like on the on the Jordan River that now now the Jordan River real quick the Jordan River is is the big problem today in the in the uh it was a problem back then with John and his problem now in people's minds right that's right because brother Reynolds said the Jordan River is is your is is it represents separation it represents uh uh when you come to the the Jordan River of your life is the deciding Point whether you're going to stay with the things of the world or were you going to cross over and be separated right but remember Elijah and Elijah when they came to the river the River Jordan and Elijah said I'm not going anywhere but I'm going to stay right with you right through thick or thin and that represents the church and Christ staying right with him and Elijah went up and and that anointing came back on the church to do greater work a double portion the anointing that was on Elijah now can come back and and go all around the world right just one person then all around the world that's right that little Stone grew into a great Mountain you see so John chapter first John chapter 5 verse one whosoever believeth that Jesus Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments that's right for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world now there's that stone coming out of the mountain and destroying destroying the things of the world in your life you know you can look at that stone coming out of the mountain and and destroying uh during the the uh tribulation and destroying all the the Russia comes out and shoots this errors into Babylon or anything but I won't focus on our lives right now because that's uh for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith faith is the it starts in faith that's the rock that's the foundation stone who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth Jesus is the son of God this is he that came by water and blood now look how he wears this this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that birth witnessed because the spirit is true right now Irene has said this about surrendous because see he's dealing with the same thing that's being dealt with today was Jesus God and flesh was Jesus God it is very important to understand what that was because on the River Jordan the the Dove came down upon the lamb which is the same thing as happening today when you get to adoption the lamb is the god in the in his church and we're led by the dove the dove comes down and told the word when you're when when the word you're built up into the image of your maker then that that Capstone can come down and have preeminence on your life and leave the church amen so he had to be the word for that Dove to come down upon him and lead him into the ministry that he was ordained to be right so Irene says this about serenthus who back back there had that the same the same concept that on the at the River Jordan he was not God he was just he came by natural means he came by his mother and father and then then the Dove came on and made him God and listen to what every hand says sirens again a man who was educated in the wisdom of the Egyptians taught that the world was not made by the primary God but by a certain power far separated from him a separate person yeah and at a distance from that principality who was Supreme Over the universe and ignorant of him who is above all he represented Jesus as having not been born of aversion but as being the son of Joseph and Mary according to the ordinary course of human generation while he nevertheless was more righteous prudent and wise than other men moreover after his baptism Christ descended upon him in the form of a dove from the supreme ruler and that then he proclaimed the unknown father and performed Miracles but at last Christ departed from Jesus and that then Jesus suffered and rose again while Christ remained impassable inasmuch as he was a spiritual being so in other words he was not God at the River Jordan and he was not God when he died that's the same thing that's being preached today right and that's the same thing that you know John had a harsh words to say about that if you can't say that Jesus was God when he paid the price that he was God from the beginning to the end right because Hebrews 13 8 says he's the same yesterday today and forever then what what is your face faith based on so so look at first you John 5 1 he says this is he that came by water and blood and in John chapter 3 he tells Nick and English you must be born of water and spirit the washing of the water of the word the water represents deity he was not just he didn't just come by by uh by natural means and and he he was a emerging a communion of Heaven and Earth God in flesh so that's what he's saying not by water only but by water and blood it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth and then he gets under that scripture that we're all familiar with therefore there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one and that was manifested right there on the repertoire and it that's that scene is so you know you've got a voice from Heaven a dove coming down on a lamb and it seems like without Revelation that there's three different people there but by revelation we know that God is one right and there are three that bear witness in Earth a spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one and they agreed to put you back inside of that one so that's that's that that the mechanism by which God puts that stone in you to start to start tearing down Babylon to bring you in communion now now look at that word communion communion has the word Union in it because communion is uniting you if you have communion with you between the husband and wife then that Ephesians chapter five just like Adam in the beginning the bone of My Flesh bone my bone flesh in my flesh that's how you know brother I'm told that he talked about his wife like he said I wish that I could just pull her inside that's right because they they had such love for one another but you know really he was talking about Christ in the church because that's how that's what God wants to do to us he wants to take that little piece of the ocean that he's that little drop spoonful of ocean that he's putting us and bring it back into himself that he might be all in all that's right that's right now so communion where uh and we're we're running out of time a little bit but now so you can see how every Community communion is is is uniting it's it's the coming of the Lord to you and and see on on that day of Pentecost that stone came rolling into the hearts of all of the beliefs and to fulfill that promise that Jesus gave them he said I will not leave you comfortless am I I will come to you okay now see that just to clarify a little bit it seems like that that uh when he was there on the River Jordan many have the idea that that the Dove and lamb were two different things is it is it the same person is it the same person that fills you with the Holy Ghost and then caps you off right is it or is it something different it's the same person right it's this exact same person right that that fills you with the Holy Ghost and gets you to play a place where he can have preeminence and then cast you off so that he can lead you now look when when when when when that anointing came on Jesus at the River Jordan there was nothing in the world could stand in his way when that anointing Came Upon David when when uh when he was anointed to be king there wasn't nothing in the world no Goliath everything came before Goliath and said I don't I don't care yeah I I'm gonna you know I don't have nothing but five little stones and and a little a little Rinky Dink slingshot and you got uh armor Bearer and people to help you and everything but it doesn't matter amen and that's the same way the church will be is when that anointing comes down their death we'll have will be conquered and remember it death on the cross he said it is finished death was finished it was conquered but yet God that stone had to come rolling down through seven churches kept come rolling down through your life amen and destroyed death and that's why in First Corinthians 15 24 the income of the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom of God even the father on each shall I put down all rules and all are already in power foreign well I had a few of I had a lot of other things but I think that'll be a good stopping point but um this uh while Brooke Wade's gone um we're gonna uh look brother Ryan's going to take the next Sunday school lesson and then uh brother Joe and then brother Louise brother Luis is doing the children's the older kids Sunday school lesson this morning so we'll we'll just uh have a a little brief period of respite until brother Wade gets back and then he'll hit the ground running so God bless you all have some of the Run may be gone but
