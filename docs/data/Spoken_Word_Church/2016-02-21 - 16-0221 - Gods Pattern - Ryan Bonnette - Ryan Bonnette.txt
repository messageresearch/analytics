TRANSCRIPT
========================================
our little bit early cuz i don't wanna leave someone done everybody see that one back that way touch screen show plan how you want to remember here white Ryan's doing frogs at times good i'm not here to think it's a little egg scerbo that's what is it okay asleep on the street Harriet yeah nail now there you go boom well in lock you can enlarge it okay okay let's all pray everybody they're going to follow the things for this day and thank you fans did they gathered here today in your name and we pray just bless the center services in the sunday school I all before you're going on her and just helps to understand the work as it comes forth upright and over the bills that just being nice to hear that's all the services for older broads around the wall of the period work and help me teaching the Sunnis cookies to say something here in the love you thank you for blessings of us all those who are sick and away from this Lord among all the other sicknesses and problems in Jesus very far away Go Fish Company on this okay what we need yeah he don't take a look just for that if I say something wrong right behind a buddy stop me so I'm going to talk about today is a variety of things but there's something on my heart for a long time and this is the culmination of a thought that I've had going for a long time and basically before I get past this slide you know this is a mustard tree called a mustard tree it comes from a mustard seed he was said if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed right you know and mustard see it yields a tree that's rests all these great all these birds of the air can rest in the lambs of this monster tree yes now thank your brother dale has been not to exalt her posture i'm just saying he wants them had a must agree mustard seed faith and for one thing he wouldn't mix it with anything because that's what mustard seeds do they don't mix with anything for another thing it's a small seed too strongly and it grows into this great big tree and all of us little eaglets addressed in the lens of that tree anything off of the freedom and all of our lives can be a mustard tree if we plant that seed of faith and believe it and won't mix it with anything after many years you know we can grow to this great big tree that's should their hope in our design I said I thought about not that much today with this lesson it kind of has something to do with it but what I want to talk about is God's pattern so Dodd has a pattern the general pattern that he follows of bringing things up from a scene from a very small form and he's very secret very mysterious about it and he brings it up slowly he's you know very slow meticulous and very secret where the role camps it was going on there's only a few instances I can think of where he deviates from that where he didn't bring from a seed of that's like in the case of Melchizedek he made a full mature man you know body sprinkled those elements over that body and stepped into it and then one for angels and came down as a grown man grown men okay that was for purpose for that time for a pint okay and then save them the scrolls brother branham god adam speaks crawls into existence bulvar on parole not little parole seeds you know and then Jesus didn't bring fish eggs and wheat seeds you know he multiplied he blessed the bread loaf livia bread and fish right and they came is fully matured fish and loaves yes so there's cases where God for a purpose to prove some point to show something he'll leave it from that but in general the pattern remains the same that it's from a small seed and very slow growth development up so small that that new birth taken place in us we almost don't even detect it sometimes we don't feel like we're making any progress but we're moving little by little we just have to keep going and when we are going to stop so our debt our objective in this lesson I want you to see how God does miraculous things and absolute simplicity and it has a pattern that he follows you carry on his work okay so Isaiah 28 10 you can read the before and after if you want four preset must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and they're little ok very slow growth process spiritually brooke being born again for numbers peter wants my dream not of corruptible seed but I've incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever God comes humble slowly in simplicity just a little bit of time and is not flashing you don't do things to show off yes until things where the Robles Lee what's going on he doesn't care to show off for anybody and you know brother Desmond talking about the body of the Son of Man was produced by was Old Testament prophets you know the foundation the Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph made that foundation and then the other prophets that built the body for Jesus coming to then the son of man Jesus he sowed the seeds for our body okay in the four Gospels all that was going on throughout those thousands of years the Old Testament nobody really knew outside of New nobody what was going on that they've been a body built that son of man will get himself a body to be to come here in and then you know the body that that Jesus sowed the seeds for our bodies okay nobody knows what's going on you know I go to work every day I work with a bunch of guys that are you know truck drivers and I'm not even better than them know that separates me from them is my new birth I'll be just the same saving that for the new verse but I sit in that truck at these farms and they're out there clucking like hens you'd be surprised how much like a truckload man can pluck like legs gossip don't sit out there go for hours on end I said oh I read my Bible and someone's growing in me and there's no idea and all of you brushes and brush shoulders with the world every day and everybody was going on it's very secret yes but it's wonderful cuz we know what's happening here identify where for when he cometh into the world he said sacrifice and offering though what it's not better body and stop repaired knee and then we know Ralph merit be drawing 2929 the secret things belong to the Lord our God but those things which I reveal belong to us and to our children forever when they do all the words of this law very secret things that God's kept hits since the foundational world since I can heaven things that have been hidden all doubt their timing slowly bringing it you know to Revelation you're not at that time Matthew 1125 that time jesus answered and said I think they'll father or if heaven earth because I hid these things from the hours of the wise and prudent that's revealed them unto babes simple babes very simple not anything great you know very simple I must quote here before he started intellectual lesson vision church age from church a book and now to these sons of God who by him overcome are given the privilege of the paradise of God and the constant Fellowship of Jesus Christ there will never more be any separation from him whether he goes his bride will go what is he is he sheriff with his beloved on a joint heir relationship his secret things will be revealed in a dark tank will be made plain we should know as we're known and we should be like him this is the heritage of the overcomer who has overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of testimony to Jesus Christ there's one of the smallest verses in the Bible ten words and in those ten words is an enormous creative act it took place over most of time we've only been here since the fall six thousand years right but science says according to the big bang theory is 13.7 billion years ago six thousand years is the money just a few minutes in the scope of all of time and that verse Scofield in the scope of the Bible says gives scope give us a ability for all those geological ages that science says happen over all the billions of years in other words it's possible the bible does not deny what science says about those millions of years after the Big Bang big man itself I believe and the fact I've got taken so many years because the six thousand years or six days of creation in the seventh day he rested was after every after heaven on earth was created then he started working specifically on the herbs okay creating us in the animals and the plants and so forth but up until that time could have been millions of years of being in here you say it was very in the beginning that denotes the beginning of time the starting time in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and the heaven there means in Hebrew Mexican all right visible heavens the sky the visible universe has all those things God created the heaven and the earth that was an enormous creative that separate from the six days of creation I already said that ok so now I'll do something a little bit different here I've got about eight minutes of a tape play for y'all and y'all ready long Josh for the random talk about this thing for the big man if you consider it their business to the place were can be sure here now the state over critical back row idol a lot of the effects get orange I don't Walker motel them and then now let's go back all runners million years before there was of stars in her anymore now the time there was nothing here dissolve forever eternity and all of every jerseys long gone you were better begin now this water made the dispenser look over and see the same time now I know man he's the father area no man can see God in the body for the goal not in body form God in interior then alright though they had seen a bummer but the only begotten of the thought of half a penny for Johnson down step notice now they're done it just fades in July there's no dark just gonna get that these nothing but in there is a glitch supernatural beans yo Olga dogaru cover all face the whole way you will Romero lasting from everlasting he into the gift of bringing that gun tasty nothing can get up now move over there nothing no matter what happens but get dongle there as a gun now let's watch for human hey what no man has seen that now that's the bomb assault upon sir in other words then everyone I begin to feel loose sacral eyes begin to form like a little halo the Sun you don't spit on spiritual eye on the look now my world in the old turf now where they are very sad if you're watching my god doom and if I down this question urgency time brings in now no one is being gone and now the next thing we begin to see by how does a supernatural looking we see little white lies morning out there quite a bit that appalled by Bible rear wheel guns are the anonymous are they are not a party then out facing the part of God begin to develop into something so human beings at tyber idea what 1000 Life food these efforts the ward off now God gave himself for do this son which was before that was even a head in it the VRA area and that was see Jesus it going by the father with a goalie that he had been bored of foundation of the world since we left in st. John was it is beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word made flesh and garden God unfolding himself down to a human being and what I did now back there's an article from that we think see nothing yet but if I out of the distant gradual we see I a little thing I that's the Sun job no gun now I can he play child full the probable later then in his imaginary makeup he begin to think of what things would be agony races next 13 life and I did every business in a sons any jurisdiction jus over friends many of the year horny quicker 30 and 45 is today still burning still pretty hair give the atomic bomb every dip lessons the comic chamber take this earth would be like this are now discussing your voice gives you the stable longer the talk a little bit and go back into the Sun where the atoms of the brain deserve so that chain where ever get any worse than just our attorneys all right then millions of in the home with Lisa's explains those spins a fair amount of a pink people had better watch this dude now you may the sun that is a single and cleaner goal but later up to stuff like dessert then we'll talk sure now just saw regarded watchman here it is all about listening years since Thompson then another device called electric world fall for millions of years then stop noticed anyone who pledges didn't now he's got coming any time and what's he doing he's right in first is the first fighter that manner will do will disarm Cecilia is the furthest distance though table despite over his dark Falls the bush celui ax is a burden to that I'm the length of the reactor wallet real one at the first coming to Jesus he came to aversion to fair come to the Wonder Cairo Tunis to Catherine's everything down to we brought it all the time and place it down all these leaders pieces of Earth our son hang out there how the sign for look at those missiles of all weapons and forgot that his friends of the names and that is Victorino now numbers all these missiles hanging out there without my boy out of the airport a question first thing you know together the iceberg now that is the further come in transition it's available piece of centered water then we need algebra turning burning block feel completely and kinda at this on top of it it's not like the Beehive know how to play power ballad hologram is probably eight thousand I'll that they brought me a lot of things and it's never been there is a burning bulkini and two-thirds of their then there's end of it in the water and 10 didn't blame about one-third and this will just crushed it living on in full of danger this folding dad nestling oil everything in that line and a to burn notice then it deserves of it water where's the father water simple hydrogen one type oxygens take foliage there's enough like 50 haverhill rooms are separating it from the whole and it may be left like this is at Birth the room did you put under a golf ball Hill New York Alton stay here in the mayor said hello kitty separate entries in fire absorb or better no such a place of elves I got that damn you a little bit we're going to see you're saying or a big pocket area now Norman but now it is a first panel and Jesus powerful away owner I can see move out to the dirdir you go to the top of begin the middle to the Sun is another big ball time and whether it is to get Belton that very big going surfing in a cut through up of our friends and come down and why did it cut out and just texted and all the places there well mentally doable makes it over first thing you know the whole thing with her with water and now we get to Genesis 1 we get diviner however picture tomorrow this one the world without form and void and was upon the face of the future that night and a fears are movable window now he's ugly the water for the you know and so forth drive all vegetation everything boundary to the sea voyage about pack your own blanket they all here okay that wasn't just occupy time look I'm not as dynamic as brother branham so I'll be better this is real then me I'm kind of monotone this is a rimini all know this but we're in a solar system and that's kind of the smallest scale of celestial bodies and a group you know in the universe is a solar system as a central either one or two stars you know some more binary system which means there's two stars in the middle of a bunch of plants but in any case most stars have planets orbiting around that's a solar system you know that I look it up it's a galaxy and it's comprised of about a hundred 100 to 400 billion stars in one galaxy in each of those stars having plants around them we live in the Milky Way galaxy they can't see it science can take a picture out because we're in the middle of it okay you can't send a probe out there it will take one hundreds of thousand years to Center about to get a picture but just to put it in the scale for you this is a called what do you call this of the world noble above spiral galaxy angle whirlpool whirlpool galaxy it's the most kind of like the standard form of most galaxies where it were rolls around like that no sir same space is orbiting or spinning okay if this were our galaxy which is the Milky Way it's a hundred thousand light-years across from this side to that side there's a hundred thousand light-years I mean it takes life 100,000 years to go from here to here I'm just trying to show you how small we are now big spaces that God made ok we live about 27,000 light-years out from the galette galactic center which is here I halfway out to the edges where we're at just in our little solar system that might be like to say our little sign there and we're already around it tiny little place and used to give y'all some perspective here now here's where it gets to me more interesting Edwin Hubble you might have heard of Edwin Hubble or the Hubble Space Telescope all right y'all know he lived without looking on board all right if born 89 1889 that's 1953 sort of like brother balance time and we live in eagle age all right in the spiritual and this age we can see further than anybody's ever seen before we can see all down to the church age we can see the range for their day and the message for our day and where we're going right because of you know the Prophet Cohen our age and God revealing to us through him all these wonderful things there's so much spiritual life you know the natural coincide was spiritual so in the natural there's also must be an ability to see further in 1929 those in authority built this Observatory was built on Mount Wilson in California Los Angeles County it was about 30 miles north of Los Santos you know one of the same cities of world they went and built this up on a mountain because as an analogy if you were standing on a swimming pool floor with all the water bubble you look up at the sky everything looks murky because of the water when they're looking out in space with these observatories the atmosphere of the earth all the air molecules keep them from seeing that good it just hinders their vision so they went up above this sin city if you will up on a mountain and build an observatory on Mount Wilson and peered out in space and saw further than man has ever seen in his face before and that man you know this just think spiritual you know then going above all the cinahl this smog fog natural but then although all that sin city to see further than ever and again and they saw further I've inspection every they're trying to prove one thing for years and years men always thought that our galaxy the new brand galaxy but I thought that was the whole universe they said the Milky Way galaxy must be the whole universe that's all there is no other galaxies they want to define him into space they wanted to find where it stops is our galaxy all there is this man was the first one to make this discovery 1929 you know do brother branham's time he saw not this galaxy but he saw one little star you know using a very primitive equipment he couldn't see that whole galaxy but if you see one little star in the corner and he determined the distance of it there's a long story behind how they judge how they mentioned the distance but they found out it was 2.5 million light-years away far beyond our galaxy so this is called the Andromeda galaxy okay and that's the posted Scouts their neighbor galaxy is two and a half million light-years away and he found out from that that we're not alone that our galaxy is not the only galaxy there are other galaxies how many we don't know okay that's that they discovered he made all right now and modern day they built the Hubble Space Telescope on the same premise that they wanted to get it above Earth I'm sure they put it out in space and now Lex even further than ever for this image was taking this and many other images you'll see here in a moment okay now must be able to go okay so now here's from science from the message from the Bible this is the best illustration that i can give you of the Big Bang and of creation this is God acting and creating you I hope you'll see the pattern here so this is what was in the beginning if you can stand there on that banish her brother Brennan was talking about and watch this is what you would have seen invisible just totally there seems nothing it's what brother Brennan said its limbs nothing no space even there was nothing but God dwelling along his attributes and the angles were there right before time again performed the creation angels of where they were God and because he traded them to make to worship him to make him God be already was God he just did you know something to worshipping to declare him to be that well there he was dwelling on with attributes and I think about him being alone morning a wife and God said it's not good that man should be alone on making a lot see so that showed some little part maybe that we can understand in all the long for any years and I wonder why for all those years I want to throw a wife to expand myself to make the family I wanted a family he wanted a family and you know and for many other reasons it's good for man to have a wife well God wanted a bride and that's the point of doing all these things creating all the universe dragging us creating everything he did was opening to get a prize here to share it in yourself with so there I thought in all his attributes and instead now here was powerful the very Spoken Word of God God had thought of creating universe the very Spoken Word of God mixed with the faith of God created the universe he spoke it he thought it he spoke it and then he believed it and nothing could stop from happening then how did that came a big bang now what's interesting what most people don't know the best that I can find let me say some more things about this before i go on to the next slide alright science says this about the only time science says this about the big thing i did it happened very fast it was very intense those in it very intense light very intense heat all of the energy the matter of time itself space and all the four fundamental forces of nature were all contained in one little impetus inspect smaller than an atom brother venom said Adam brush it up John okay whether it's a size and out of our smaller doesn't matter what is it was all in one speck it sounds like dogs pattern was snorting from a seed working his way up brenna I think referred to him as a contractor lane I was building material she just stretched his building materials across space for just eons of time for infinity just stressed everything out late I was building material he started building the ground up who else lived in brother branham's time that was interesting is Einstein just born in eighteen seventy nine left to 1916 365 them what if Einstein gave us the e equals MC squared but they always talks about energy cannot be created or destroyed that's a calculation or only a formula about energy and matter energy can convert to matter and matter can convert back to energy so what was in that little speck how can everything be containing that speck was because it was energy was pure energy God traded it science doesn't know what started that Big Bang back and they can see pretty much holla back to that big bang they don't know what happened before that they don't know that God spoken I'll spoke that into being and then he said let there be and then it broke off and there came creation and energy also took on mass matter and spread out and start to form protons neutrons electrons this camp which became atoms and molecules and gases and stars and planets and so forth okay but it's just unfathomable unfathomable what happened in that personal moment of creation now here's what y'all probably don't know after that a sort of a dark age now I don't know there is any indication in the message if the angels were back there watching this but wouldn't they have been if you're back there with God both the fallen angels I mean well the unfallen angels okay well certainly I would say watching the creation happen and I wonder if you could say maybe that they were beginning to get nervous because here have God had made this wonderful creation just let there be and everything came out from that and also nothing because science says that it went to something called opaque which it means it's invisible nothing going on as far as you can see just like a mixture of really no substance just just like a cloud of nothing just North cloud spread out over space and for hundreds of thousand years there was nothing no light or nothing until stars begin to form from that goals happiness is building returns were laid out and he was forming the building blocks that make up everything little by little okay and I wonder if the Fallen Angels could have seen that and they probably laughed at God and said well he messed up because he created had this big bang and then nothing no sounds like a lot of what God does is happening so subtle that the world that fallen angels can sort of see it happen it takes them off guard I'll have time to give all the particular about this just a few minutes oh I see but then now this that was a this is a computer-generated image of that Big Bang well they think might look like this is the real image from Hubble Space Telescope this is actually early the earliest stars from after the Big Bang these are the early stars began to form the reason we could seem today after 14 billion years is because energy spread out faster than light and went faster than speed like much faster and so the light from those stars that originally formed is just now getting turf okay that's how come they can just now see that in the original after that big bang as these stars no galaxies get their stars you see a lot of gas that's where stars form from is the gas okay it was all floating around gas and dust and so forth began to form in the stars then these are something just taken from Hubble as well of modern-day you know what we can see a bit of galaxies all across the sky and they say that there are about all together something like 100 billion galaxies in the whole universe in the observable universe but they can see with modern day technology 100 million each of them with several hundred billion stars in there and then this is taking us some kind of a some kind of a light radiates there's different forms of life that we can't see that's out there in the universe there's a whole big spectrum of life that's not visible all right only a portion of the visible with telescopes so they have to use infrared telescopes ready radio telescopes and so forth and they can see that these galaxies these are galaxies that are connected sort of in a way of that you know science didn't know that until during the last ten or twenty years and so in the big slope of things this is the web of the universe of all the galaxies combined and you would say you know in ours isn't shown on here this is where they've taken it in of an image proton space but just to prove a point arge might be this one little speck might be our guy and inside that one respect and on corner that speck is our son and outside of that little son is our earth but God's whole focused out of all this his whole focus is is centered on that one little speck over in the corner you know that's where all God's focus is and has been for all the time to try to get a product that's pretty much my whole lesson so now I'm going to just show you all some other slides that might interest you this is another picture taken of a galaxy from I don't know which one that would be much what that's called but you can see all these billions of stallers whirling around mountains base fascinates me I've always been so fascinated with space because my god make this and you make for purpose you know and I believe someday will be able to you know when we travel like a thought and I wouldn't be surprised if in eternity if we could travel out these on these things I love me this is a this is a black hole surrounded by the matter that's being pulled into it let's say that every galaxy has a black hole in the middle of that's what kind of holds things together a black hole is where her son has gotten so big that it collapsed on itself the gravity is too strong and it collapses well then when it does it forms like a negative whatever antimatter or whatever and it cools the other stores and things in on it and converts matter back in energy this is pure energy shooting back out into space which eventually turns into other stars back in the matter that's just energy and life or they were broken down from there and that's two galaxies somewhere that have collided coalesced or whatever they call me these are images in space of dust and gas these are probably most of these you would see or several hundred thousand light years in size you know you fit several of our galaxy's inside of some of these clouds of dust that come out of nebulae where stars are born gases and things are floating around where stars are born I don't know how many gods ever seen and these things but these are immaculate and our God is the one that created all this and other nebulae where stars being born gases helium hydrogen gas and so forth and it's interesting to me that a lot of these you can see some figures some forms you know brother branham saw that and many people saw that cloud that uh you know with the pillar that cloud that descended and how all those figures in it and a lot of these you can say some figured I don't know if there's a significant say that I'm just saying but there's a lot of figures that you can see in many of these things just like in our daytime sky you can look going to see a lot of things where there's any thing to that or not as a nebula where stars are born a star being born that is a many of them in space look like a giant I just a teacher hydrogen helium gases Oh crown and this is just many many galaxies and stars having space right mm-hmm I fastest will people like 186,000 miles per second I didn't ever say that sorry needed it 186,000 miles per second between play is a speed of light if you want to talk about the best mrs. face and so like I said our galaxy if you look at this being our galaxy right there so basically this is Milky Way galaxy it's 100,000 100,000 light years across so like troubling hundred eighty-six thousand miles per hundred and eighty-six thousand off per second goes across month or something like this you can see it moving Arlene that's how much space is and you know it took a big God to make a big space like a fair God put that into perspective you can go around this earth seven and a half the one second with lot yet like yeah so we think we're baking something weird on we're nothing we're a tiny little speck and getting gone thanks so much else yeah that's what makes monochrome cry like a baby sometimes because i think you know Jesus a heaven earth will pass away heaven earth in the beginning God created the heaven Jesus turning said heaven earth will pass away my world never passed away I don't believe he meant that all of this will pass i want to make it just to destroy i think he meant that the sin will be burned all through all those things you know even the earthy is going to maintain it but the frame oh but he's got to burn the sin off oh and we'll draw here first trip but you know there's a wonderful universe out there to enjoy you know just look up some time on google topping hubble space telescope in you'll be really amazed at what god has done and it's right around this whole time i just think about ssl having having questions compression two things without a purpose in there right when we get there we'll know exactly he's kind of purpose for all so okay thank y'all folks if you have any questions on that simulates question makes a bit of where we're at so far not what we're going to move beyond
