uh we will have some games and prizes and things to do after that for the for the young people and the adults we can just Fellowship around the word of the Lord amen you love the Lord put the word first the word's most important then when we put the word first everything else should fall in line so let's sing bro Louise saying is our brother comes every praise is to our God every word of worship Every Praise every praise is to our God sing Hallelujah [Music] do I pray who is to our God oh God my savior God my healer God might deliver yes he is yes [Music] God my healer Lord God might deliver Earth yes he is yes he is [Music] amen how many can testify today that he's your savior he's your healer he's your deliverer amen he's our everything amen with him we can do all things without him we can do nothing amen I'm a firm believer that the word says if God be for us then who can be against us amen if somebody said well all we've got is him I believe that's all we need amen we want to say God bless you all this afternoon how many is glad to be a Christian today amen you're thankful to be in the house of God on a Saturday afternoon and to be enjoying the presence of the Lord and fellowshipping with the Believers and amen it's just a special time to be serving the lord it seems like everything is attacking Christianity and the things of God in this generation but to be in a numbered is one of them I believe that's the greatest honor of Our Lives amen and if you have your Bibles today will you go straight to the word we want to turn to the Book of Matthew the third chapter The Book of Matthew the third chapter and then also we're going to look in the book of Ephesians the sixth chapter and that we also want to say God bless you and we sure appreciate the invitation by the way he's inviting us to come back and be with you all again and I think last time he asked me if about coming I asked him if he was going to be here because it's just not the same being here and him not here picking on you I think last time we was here he was uh I think he was out maybe in Illinois killing them little old deer out there you know I I tell you man him things are small out there you know no we're just just joking with him amen but we sure appreciate by the way he appreciate his stand for this message and what the church here stands for and just to have a burden on your heart to do something for the young people we want to say thank you Amen to stand for this word and give him a place to Fellowship amen we sure appreciate the burden here on this assembly for this word and of course it's good to have my wife here in Mirai I think sister uh June back there has already grabbed a little baby so we're sure sure thankful to have them here with us this weekend and in the Book of Matthew the third chapter we want to look here in the 10th verse very familiar scripture here the Bible says and now also the ax is laid unto the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth forth not forth good fruit is shown down and cast into the fire I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I'm not worthy to Bear now he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand he will thoroughly purchase floor gather his wheat into the Garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire now then cometh Jesus From Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him but John forbade him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and cometh thou to me and Jesus answering saith unto him suffer it to be so now so this is not in the future not in the past but suffer this to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him amen now what I like about that is John is speaking to Jesus Jesus speaking back to John and he's showing them this is our purpose or this is our commission now in the book of Ephesians the sixth chapter I just want to read two verses from there and we'll pray and let you be seated this is another very familiar reading to to the Believers it's where Paul is addressing the Christian Soldiers and in Ephesians the sixth chapter and in the 13th verse he says now wherefore take unto you so you gotta you gotta possess it you gotta you gotta you gotta take it take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to they and having done all to stand now watch this stand so he does not give you another option if standing don't work here's something else to try he said but when you've done all to stand stand therefore having your loins Girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness amen let's just bow our hearts together how many would say Lord speak to me today Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here this afternoon we're very well aware that we're not in this building by ourselves but Lord I believe there's an Angelic host in this building father to push back against the spirits of unbelief the spirits of doubt and Lord to bring of faith into the hearts of your children now Lord I pray that you would send the anointing in the building for Lord without the anointing the Yoke will remain but Lord because of the anointing the Yoke shall be destroyed father may you destroy the Yoke over the lives of these young people or whatever the enemy would be trying to tempt him in their minds and bind them in their Spirits oh God I pray that you would release him by your word today and Father may this be an Emmaus Road experience Lord and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory and the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the believer says hey man you may be be seated here today I want you by the help of the Lord for just a few moments to take those two passages of scripture and if I'd speak to you today I want to title this it becometh us to take a stand it becometh us to take a stand now brother Brandon preaches 1961 he preaches an entire sermon beautiful sermon and he calls it it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness now uh those of you that have the table you have the folio views on your computer if you'll look there you'll find that right underneath the title it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness you'll see that brother random actually originally titles that sermon stand for righteousness so it becometh us to fulfill our righteousness and in there I remember when I was first studying that tape over and over and over you're hearing him talk about stand Stan Stan and I begin to wonder why is he focusing so much on a stand but then I realized he's actually preaching stand for righteousness now in the book of Ephesians Paul says having done all to stand he says stand therefore amen having your loins gird about with truth now when you look at this word stand the word means to set it means to establish it means to stand still it is to be it to stand by it is to set up in the presence of others Amen in the midst before judges before members of the Sanhedrin it means to place to make firm to cause a person amen or a thing to keep his or its place so when something is standing it's in a position when something is standing it is not moving to the left or to the right but it is fixed amen it is to establish a thing it is to uphold or to sustain amen The Authority or the force of anything it is to stand and movable to stand firm of the foundation of a building so actually the foundation of this building is the stand of this building amen another definition means to continue safe and sound to stand unharmed he meant to stand ready or prepared to be of a steadfast mind of equality I love this one it is one who does not hesitate or does not waver amen so when one is standing they're not hesitating they're not wavering amen they're standing there amen without waver now my next question for you is how are we going to stand amen without wavering well brother Branham says the only way we can stand without wavering is we must have an unwavering Faith now in the message resurrection of Lazarus 51 he says now look deity I'm a part of Charles Branham because I was born from Charlie Branham my Daddy I'm a part of him I got a forehead like him my hair was like him I'm a small man like like him I'm in the nature like him because he's my dad and if we become in spirit sons of God Amen then deity dwells in the man see then you talk about blind eyes being open he said they said nothing is impossible to God Amen but God said nothing is impossible with you amen if you'll believe not with God but you amen deities in man amen amen deity is in man see the very God that stood back there on the mythical platform of the eternities and rolled the worlds off of his hands and created these things give you the privilege Amen to be his son and you are a part of him and God dwells in mankind and man himself is deity now that that's not that's not a skim milk man himself is deity amen there you are it might choke you amen but God dwells in man and man becomes the Son of God not him and himself amen about the Holy Spirit that's in him is God Amen the Creator lives in the creation he said then stand within an unwavering faith and ask what you will amen and it will be done unto you amen if you have got the holy ghost in your soul amen then you're not just a son of an Earthly father amen and an Earthly mother but there's an element of deity amen God himself is in you amen now come on church because you're a twofold being amen you're a human being but you're also let me sit this way you're you're a human being but you're also a god being amen I believe that the humanity is the wavering part amen I believe it's the humanity that wavers I believe it's the humanity that gets discouraged I believe it's the humanity that gets tired amen but there's another part of you amen and greater is he that is in you amen than he that is in the world now come on church amen it's the humanity see that is wavering it's the deity that's unwavering now the prophet of God said what made that big tumor disappearing my wife yesterday amen just a few days ago she was ready for the operating table and now they can't find a thing it's because the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that token of God that he still lives destroyed it what does these things what causes them to happen amen it's because you're he said no he said you're a product see amen so hold the token in your unwavering faith in his Word of Promise Amen to hold the token in his unwavering Faith In The Word of Promise now amen I know there's two ways we could say this amen we could say make a stand and take a stand now I know you're probably thinking there's no difference but actually I got to study on it and I found out that there is a difference in making a stand and taking a stand I didn't I did not title this it'd becometh us to make a stand I totally it became a faster take a stand because when you make a stand amen refers to a single event or a decision amen but when you take a stand it is more often applied to taking or adopting amen a stance or position to actions amen over a period of time so if you make a stand it's temporary amen but if you if you take a stand amen it's something that's going to last more than just a service it's going to last more than just the Youth Camp it's going to last more than just a special meeting amen when you take a stand you are avowing to God that what I'm standing for is something I'll still be standing for a year from now amen or two years from now amen because see our stand is our position amen our stand is our position that's why the prophet of God said amen God may we tonight take our stand amen our position in Christ he said they're like men and women of God Sons and Daughters are the Creator who just spoke the world came into existence he said God we call ourselves Christians and can't even believe for little healings amen what you promised to give us God forgive us amen of our stupidity and may we rise tonight like real men and women Sons and Daughters of God and go forth in the earth conducting ourselves in like manner amen then as Sons and Daughters of God Amen it is our duty Amen to stand for Jesus Christ I love what the prophet said he said it's our duty to take our stand it's God's duty to back us up amen it's our duty to take the stand amen but it's God's duty to back us up amen that's why now I'm just going to preach for a second he said because if you do your part amen then you'll find out that God will do his amen if you do your part your part is taking the stand amen but God's part is to supply Supply the strength Amen to continue in the stand that you've taken now another place you said then when we take our stand today when men say these things can happen don't be fussing with him amen that's wrong don't fuss with them but pick up the sword see now watch here's your part amen pick up the sword amen look at what's supposed to be in this day when God give his promise for today he said now pick this up this Bible The Sword and go and all the goliaths will fall under it amen when you pick up when you do your part and you pick up the sword amen and go forward amen all the goliaths will fall underneath the sword come on church it was not David's job to put Goliath under the sword it was David's job to pick up the sword to take God at his word and to withstand amen that uncircumcised Philistine but it was God's part Amen to lay the life underneath the sword of David listen church it's not your part Amen to put the devil underneath her foot it's not your part to defeat the Devil amen God already defeated that devil 2 000 years ago amen your part is to pick up the faith in the word of God Amen and March over those Devils with a full unwavering faith in the Vindicated word of God now come on amen amen sometimes you've got to realize it all and all up to the preacher it ain't all up to the pastor it ain't all up to the youth leader amen sometimes you got to realize you got a part to play amen it was David's part to pick up the sword it was David's part to take a stand it was David's part to confess that God was bigger than that uncircumcised Philistine amen but it was God's part to lay glass under David's sword amen David was too small to do that David had no physical ability he meant to take a giant and make a and make a a a a a a a defeated enemy out of him but God had the power because David had the courage to take a stand you know I find many times that people make stands at camps and they make stands and meetings and conventions and the reason they make those stands is because the atmosphere amen is so charged and amen it's so easy to say that's right I'll I'll stand for Jesus you know amen getting a good hot meeting on a Saturday night in the power of God moving amen and it's easy to Rejoice it's if you got a sickness in your body amen go through a good prayer line and the anointing is there and the power of God is there and you say I'm Healed and you walk out the door amen now what you did was you made a stand amen but when you get home and you wake up the next morning and that old lying symptom is still there amen you've got to take a stand now amen you made a stand last night amen but now you got to take a stand remember said you've got to make a stand and then continue to stand amen you got to take a stand by continuing to stand I don't believe that God is looking for people Amen to make us stand temporarily but I believe he's looking for someone who will take an eternal stand now the prophet of God said faith cannot rest upon the shifting Sands of man's theology but Faith takes its Eternal stand upon the unchangeable and unshakable Rock of Ages and can stand there while the waves amen is beating the bottom out of it amen and the grave is open and look across the sea to him that said I am the resurrection and the LIE see amen stand there now I'll sit like this if you don't stand for something you're going to fall for anything if you don't stand for something you're going to fall for anything do you realize that there's actually only two positions today amen that people will find themselves in they're either standing or they're bowing they're either standing or they're bowing you say now now preacher what are you getting at well as Believers I believe that we are to stand I I just don't believe we're to Bow till they ought to see you I don't believe we're to bow to spirits of this world I'll be honest with you I don't believe that a church ought to bow to the spirit of lukewarmness I I just don't think we ought to bow to these things I believe amen that the time has come that Satan don't want us to stand amen but God is calling for us to stand but remember said it's so strange to see that when people take a stand for God looks like the devil throws everything in their way that he can Amen to throw in their way but do you realize we're one of the greatest experiences in your life comes from it comes from standing brother Emma said the greatest experience I've ever had is to come up against something I could not get over or under it but I just stand there amen and I watch God make a way through it see that's the way to do it just move just keep moving amen press your nose against it and amen just keep moving on God Will Make A Way amen then your stand is connected to your Victory amen your stand is connected to seeing amen the situation changed amen and God come on the scene and get the glory I believe that time is at hand Amen to make a stand and take a stand what about it young people I think it's time to make a stand but I think it's time to take a stand but remember said if you're going to make a stand for God make it now amen this is the time now's the time that we need it he said another place I want to go on record in heaven tonight that in this Auditorium here in this great City of Chicago in the High School auditorium I want to go on record amen that I stand for Jesus Christ I want to go on record today that I stand for Jesus Christ and for his righteousness another place if you'd lived in some days gone by when they crucified Jesus you'd say oh I would have stood for him I'd give my life for him amen but you have more of an opportunity to do that now than you would in them days see he said stand now amen the opposition is greater today than it was then amen well if I'd have been there man in the days of the crucifixion I would have stood for him amen but right here in this age they're crucifying amen the word of God young people and you've got as much a chance right now to take a stand amen as they did on the day of Calvary amen because the word is being crucified again but I believe that God is raising up a generation of young people who will not back up they will not turn around they will not lay down amen but they will put their nose to the devil and they will push back against that devil until Liberty come on church I think that's what we need in the house of God Amen it's not so much arrogant infested and who can do what who can say what I think we need the liberty of the Holy Ghost Amen to come back in the church in the fire and the Dynamics of the spirit of God until there comes a strength in the church now amen I don't believe that God Amen has called us to be weaklings I don't believe God has called us to be cowards amen but I believe it takes courage to make a stand I love what the Bible says in second Peter 1 it says the prophecy came not an old time amen by the will of men but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost you know what kind of men we're talking about we're not talking about church members we're not talking about religious uh social gatherers we're talking about God called individuals the prophet of God said and God don't want cowards oh brother God don't want cowards he cannot use you if you're afraid to take his word and believe him he wants Gallant men amen that won't pay attention to nothing amen but what the Lord says that's the kind he has to move with now listen Church regardless of what the church says what the pastor says what the church stands for he stands for God and righteousness and his word amen a god-called man is not a coward amen A God Called man is a gallant man he's a man that stands for God his word and righteousness now as message Believers I know sometimes as young people we spend a lot of time Amen instilling in our young people what we stand against we we let's just be honest we do we stand against this and we stand and we do we do we we actually do stand against things but I just want to say this as message Believers we don't just trying to get something but we actually stand for something we're not just here standing against something we actually stand for something everybody said in the church age book he said now remember this that Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and would defile it make it lukewarm amenformal and Powerless it exposes Satan it Reveals His works the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word amen right down to the time he is cast in the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it because he knows listen the devil knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is now listen and what she stands for amen not just what she stands against amen but what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works she won't be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits we in the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit amen then Satan will be powerless before her come on church amen the devil is not powerless before us amen because of what we stand against I'm going to preach to you amen because we're not the only people that stand against women cutting their hair we're not the only people that stand against boys not wearing shorts well we used to amen we're not the only people that stands against having televisions and if we used to we ought to do it now because it's still the word of God now now it's Saturday morning or Saturday afternoon I might as well preach I'm here amen what we've stood against then we still stand against today but that's not where the strength is coming from Amen to defeat the Devil and to do the Greater Works amen the strength is coming from what we stand for see he will be as definitely forwarded today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him and the dancer oh yes Satan hates Revelation amen but we love it amen we love Revelation with the true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail against them see what she stands for amen not against is what produces an invincible Army now somebody said well brother Ram said there we've got to discern that's right amen but let me break this down for you Discerning is one thing and with standing is another Discerning is one thing but withstanding what has been discerned is another you know the prophet preaches an entire sermon called the discernment of spirit right he says and every Christian is under commission Amen to discern or to try the spirit amen and to prove whether it's of God or not right amen now listen it's easy to discern something and say well that's right or that's wrong amen but where the battle comes is when you've got to withstand what you discern to be wrong I can prove it to you from the Bible in the book of Samuel the Bible says that David spake to the man stood by him and said what shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine and taketh away the approach from Israel amen now watch for who is this uncircumcised philistine that he should defy the armies of the Living God now watch a prophet amen pick this up in scripture he shows you what the Bible says how that David threw both The Lion and the bear and he said now this uncircumcised Philistine amen shall be as one of them when David identified this that Goliath was an uncircumcised Philistine who had put a reproach upon the armies of the Living God and something ought to be done about this therefore amen David discerned Goliath amen but that was not David with standing Goliath the Bible says that he went and took his staff in his hand and he chose him five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had even in a script and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the Philistine so David didn't just stand out there and say brother Zach something's got to be done something's got to be done but when David went over there and picked up five smooth stones and he got his slingshot and he walked out there and met that Goliath he was no longer just Discerning Goliath amen but now he was withstanding Goliath and I believe there's an army here today that's not just Discerning things and laodicea is wrong amen but there is a strength and there is a courage that has come into the heart of this generation Amen to withstand those Devils they said we don't just withstand the devil at church we withstand him on Monday morning we were standing on Tuesday week amen because we're not here just to say well this is wrong and that's wrong we're here to withstand these things but you got to take a stand now but membership by faith David saw the victory he said he saw the victory he said look out Goliath you've got to fall and when he set that loose the Holy Ghost amen got a hold of that little Stone and picked up a speed about a thousand miles per second and struck that giant between the face and he fell forward Hallelujah Oh my he said like a little Jim Crow danced up there jumped on him pulled his sword out chopped his head off said how do you like fat boy reached down got him by the hair of his head said come on boys amen let's preach Divine Healing and away they went he said you know what they done the rest of them seen it could be done and they cut Philistines Plum to the wall the come on Amen Goliath had every one of them as a bunch of cowards they've been scared to death to do anything amen but when God got a hold of a David and he discerned that devil and he withstood that devil and he cut Goliath's head off amen that brought a liberty into the entire Camp he meant to believe that God God if he could do it for David he could do it for me let me say church amen we don't need a thousand people here today we just need one believer Amen to get in contact with a god of Abraham and believe that if he did it for you he can do it for somebody else and in a few minutes devils are going to find spirits will be defeated listen because God just needs somebody to get some courage to get some grit to take a stand listen David I love how David says this in psalm 16 verse 5. he says the Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup thou amen maintain this my lot you know what David here is saying brother Wade I believe that David is saying the Lord is my portion you agree the Lord is my portion now when you start looking at this word portion amen portion means territory so what David is actually saying is the Lord is my territory in other words he is all that I have and all I have is because of him in other words there will be no fight until the devil gets on my territory they'll be we know there'll be no Bloodshed there'll be no swords drawn until the devil gets over on my inheritance then there's going to be a battle because the Bible says in Psalm 73 26 My Flesh and my heart failth amen but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever Psalms 119 57 Thou Art my portion O Lord I have said that I will keep my words Psalms 142 verse 5 I Cried unto thee O Lord I said Thou Art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living Lamentations 3 24 the Lord is my portion saith my soul therefore will I hope in him so David here is speaking of an inheritance he is speaking of apportion he is speaking of a Heritage now do you realize that we as spiritual Sons and Daughters of God we have a spiritual Heritage and our spiritual Heritage is none other amen then the word of God the Bible says in Acts 20 verse 32 now Brethren I commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up amen and to give you an inheritance among all them which are Sanctified amen now the word of Grace can justify you then it can bring you over into the Second Step a stage of restoration and can give you an inheritance among those which are Sanctified that's what the prophet of God said he said if God can ever get a people under his own control if you'll get a man or a woman that won't compromise on his word but will stand there like the Rock of Ages amen when you have been given a portion of inheritance among those which are Sanctified you have been given a place in the Rock of Ages and you will stand like the Rock of Ages stood they'll believe every word of it that'll believe that he's behind it and a man who believes it you must act like it and if you don't act like it then you don't believe it but if you believe it then act like it and you know that's powerful can I read that again amen if you believe it then act like it if you don't act like it then you don't believe it but if you believe it then act like it and you can put it to work and the word will be in you see then how is our heritage lost amen our heritage is lost by compromising when we give up our stand when we give up our position the polygon said we lost our heritage because we just compromised and when we compromise now listen church when we compromise eyes then we cannot expect God to keep his promise to us when we compromise we cannot expect God to keep his promise to us are you ready for this because we broke in up on this sacred Trust yeah and they found the trust that God gave us he said then let us keep that trust keep it sacred keep it holy keep every word of it and compromise nowhere then do you realize as young people that you did not stumble into this age you did not accidentally stumble into this age amen we have been sent into this age do you know why we've been sinning this age to prove God's word Paul said in Romans 12 he said I beseech you verse one therefore my brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable amen now watch this unto God which is your reasonable service and being not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove that you may prove that ye may prove what is that good amen and acceptable and perfect will of God Revenge preaches an entire sermon and he calls it proving his word paragraph 210 he said he proves all of his words just think of it all of his words and you were his word he was the word and you were a part of this word and that's the reason you're sent here is to confirm your place in life so you didn't stumble people into laodicea you didn't stumble into this message but you were sent here amen by the predestination of almighty God Amen to confirm your place in life now watch a prophet turn a corner and say there will be a resurrection of the Dead there will be a Rapture of the church there will be a millennium there will be a new heavens and a new Earth amen and he'll prove it because his word said so and only the righteous will be there only the righteous only the ones who took a stand amen and they did not back off of the Sacred trust they did not defile The Inheritance they did not compromise one place but they stood and they put their nose against the devil and every day every week every month every year they fought back against the devil amen because they're here to confirm their place as a Victorious son and daughter of God Only The Righteous will be there oh that now can I preach to you only the ones that's been made part of this word see will be their part and their position in this word for this day for their age will be the only ones who'll be there because that's just what it is he is the word and what is a woman she is the image of a man what is the church the image of the word only the True Believers in his word amen know this and can believe it amen only the True Believers in his word know this and can't believe it then what is this message the message of the hour amen is a spiritual union to Christ by the word amen you are the bride of Christ right then listen what a prophet said he said the bride will know her husband will know her mate the revealed word then you are married to the revealed word there is a sacred trust in the revealed word you have got a position to confirm in that revealed word and this right amen this bride then she's not going to come into this Sanctified among the Sanctified but the way she's going to come in is she's going to be Washed by the Water of the word Paul said amen that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word I love what the prophet said he said cleanse us Lord how many say Lord today just cleanse us man just cleanse the sword amen from all unbelief that we might be drawn nigh unto thee as a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God Amen for this is our reasonable service what did Paul say he said that we might be washed By the Waters of the word do you know what a washing means a washing means a bath or a bathing amen do you know what a bath does Amen a bath actually separates you amen from the dirt now now some of you Brothers you come home you've been outside working all day dirt under your fingernails dirt behind your ear smell like a pole can amen and there's a there's a beautiful table spread with all kinds of good food you know amen you don't walk in amen kick your boots off go sit down at the table all that filth on you and partake of the meal but your wife says honey go take a shower amen and what do you do you get in the shower now when you get in that bath you're going to get underneath the water then there's going to be some soap now come on Amen hopefully you believe in pain gonna be some soap amen and what's going to happen is the dirt is going to be attached to you but when you get out of the shower you're going to get out but the dirt's going to stay you know what that tells me brother Mike Matt tells me that the dirt is not more powerful than the water the dirt is not more powerful than the soap there is something in the water and the soap that can a serp an authority over that dirt and cause it to take its hands off of you and let you come out clean don't you see why you need to come to church it's cause dirt gets in our lives it gets into our homes and when that word begins to lay out over the church the washing of the Water by the word amen begins to push back the dirt and you come out clean you come out clean and the dirt stays behind amen because our bath is the Waters of Separation brother Bob it's not the Waters of mixing it's the Waters of separation and the Waters of separation is by the word now we read Matthew three I love Matthew 3 because in there Jesus is speaking with John and John is asking Jesus why would someone like me have to baptize someone like you basically yeah and the prophet picks us up and says now why would a man like Jesus have to be baptized he said why would a person have to be baptized like a man coming baptism is after confession he had no confession to make because he was God see but what it is is he was our example right our example is Christ so then there must be a basis that we can put our faith on remember him said like this he said the truth of it was he was the anatype he was the high priest and before the high priest could be anointed he had to be washed amen so before an anointing there must be a washing I'm just going to preach to you what I believe for a second I believe we've tried to have too many anointings without without it without Washings they're gonna come on Amen we're screaming for the anointing but we don't want no washing amen but the anointing follows the washing it's an Ezekiel or Exodus rather sorry Exodus 29 when the Bible said shall wash them with water then shout thou take the anointing oil and pour it up on his head and anoint him see Aaron the high priest before he could ever be anointed he had to be washed with the water see the Bible said that Jesus was anointed where the Holy Ghost and went about doing good things so before Jesus was anointed with the Holy Ghost he was at the river of Jordan the water and he received the baptism amen as an example to every belief her who will believe on the name of the son of God and will be baptized in that name will come through a washing that there will come an anointing upon the life of that believer because why we are Kings and Priests unto God now the Bible says Revelation 1 5 he said we have been washed which means loose from our sins in his own blood see then the blood was greater than the sin when you went through the blood you come out but the sin stayed in the Sin could not pass to the blood because there was something greater in the blood than there was in the Sin oh if you've got Hallelujah if you can raise your hands and say God I've been sealed I've been saved I've been cleansed by the blood you ought to be the happiest person in this church today that there's a blood there's a propitiation there's an atonement and there's something in that blood that's greater than what was in your sin come on Church the blood is strong the blood is powerful program said what washed he said actually the word wash means loose he said now it was in his own blood that he loosed us completely from our sins it was not human blood can we agree it was not human blood he said now watch it was the blood of God Peter called it the blood of Christ Paul called it the blood of the Lord and the blood of Jesus it was not three persons but it was one person there's that Revelation again one God that omnipotent Jehovah God came down and made himself in a body by means of the Virgin birth and indwelt it that he might be the blood of God that would free us or loose us entirely the blood of God would loose us entirely from our sins and would present us spotless before himself with exceeding great joy Revelation 1 5 he has washed Us in his own blood Revelation 1 6. now watch after the Washington comes 1 6 and hath made us amen Kings and Priests unto God right after the washing amen comes in identification that you're not just a wash church member but you was washed for a purpose you were washed to become a king and a priest unto God oh God wash first you were washed first now come on Church you were washed first but now watch a prophet and then anointed for service it you were washed first and then anointed for service amen see you've been washed and anointed brother brother brother Elise what have we been washed for what have we been anointed for to bring forth a testimony for God said now watch in First Corinthians 5 he says read it now to whip that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us amen the word of reconciliation are you ready for this amen that Christ was God's testimony because God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself amen God was in Christ reconciling the so what was Christ doing he was bringing forth the testimony of God now come on church let me preach because all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into the church then Church of the Living God you've not been brought on the earth to be a slave to depression to be a slave to Suicide to do a service under the world you have been liberated by the washing of the water of the word to bring forth the testimony unto God you're not put here to do la Odyssey a service you're here to do God a service you're not here come on don't get mad at me you're not here to do education a service you're here to do God a service come on adults you're not here Amen to put your business on the map your business on this Earth is to do God as service and everything everything everything falls secondarily to the word of God having preeminence you're here to do a service now I think it's amazing because I'm just gonna I'm gonna slow down and read this I love this because who else could go to the Book of Matthew 3 like a prophet and could go back and could rehearse to you a conversation between John and Jesus he said now and Reverend picks it up he said now he said so for this to be so he said that's right in other words now listen to this John now now John here is asking for the Bible he's asking why do I need to baptize you you need to baptize me he's got all these questions but what he don't realize is John has a position he has a place in life to confirm and Jesus says John you're a mighty man you're a great man you're a mighty prophet your revelation of me is exactly the truth you know who I am you know because your ministry didn't come from man your ministry came from God you never learned it of man you wasn't taught this in a seminary but at the age of nine years old you went into the Wilderness because you were born an odd peculiar child and from your very birth God began to deal with you and even before your birth the prophet saw you and you are alive to this day now watch this you know who I am you know who I am because God in the wilderness told you there'd be a sign following me and you've already bore witness of it and you know it and we know who each other are we know each other and it is true that you need to be baptized to me but let's suffer that to be so for John if we are the lights of this day if we are the lies of this day then we must fulfill all righteousness all of God's word must be fulfilled by us for this day for it is becoming to us it is behooving it is becoming it is like us for if we are the true Witnesses of God today then John we are the lights of this age and if we are the lots of this age there's so much scripture that's got to be fulfilled during this age and it's up to us hallelujah it's up to us to see amen that all of God's righteousness is fulfilled and what is his righteousness it's his word so before Jesus sat down and had a youth service with John on a Saturday afternoon and looked at him face to face and said John you're here for a greater purpose you're here to do more than just run the woods you're here to do more than just eat the locusts and the Honey amen but you are here because you are the light of this day John you got a commission upon your life you got a purpose upon your life and the prayer to God said every age had light I don't know how to do this maybe like this you know brother Wade it'd be like me and you sit down here you know and we talk and you're sitting over there and I'm sitting here and you say now brother Andrew we're gonna go in this building we're going to tear out the walls we're going to build a new wall we're going to lay a new floor we're going to paint the ceiling we're talking about this and I'm saying but brother brother Wade who's going to do this who's going to do this brother Wayne I know some of y'all there can't see me let me move over here brother Wade uh oh sorry I put it back who's gonna do this uh by the way I'm not good enough brother I just I just don't think I can see you're a carpenter you're you're a real Carpenter I'm I'm just an old body by the way if anybody could do this it should be you but brother Wade said but listen you're a part of this you got a job to do listen and if you don't do it Andrew it ain't going to get done this is your assignment you're this this project you know what I'm gonna do when when reality strikes me that I gotta do this I'm gonna stand up and I'm gonna say well it ain't gonna get done sitting here crying about it we got to get to work when the reality hits my heart that I've got a job to do and as long as we're sitting here rehearsing it it's never going to get done come on church when are you going to realize you got more to do amen than just send Church three times a week you got a job to do it's to be more than a church member it's to be a live and walk and breathe and talk and manifested adopted son of almighty God walking in Authority walking in anointing walking in power walking in reality walking in Revelation listen it falls your lot it falls your lot we got to do it amen we got to do it if it's going to get done it's going to be done by the ones who's called to do it so let's get up and get to work I'm preaching to you now let's get up and get to work in other words see but a lot of this age should do the same thing the word will not come easy it comes by observation you've got to press your way to it but yet it be who with us it's becoming to us to fulfill all of God's righteousness we must do it can we say that together we must do it program said let's go back for just a minute and take up some characters who knew their position in their day and was willing to stand criticism or anything else amen that the word of God might be fulfilled do you realize that John had to overcome amen the Mind Battle of being criticized for baptizing Jesus brother he had to overcome that but when he realized that it becometh him to take a stand and taking a stand to fulfill the word of God he said let him criticize let him say what they want to I'll Stand for God and let the world go by I said like this Jesus desire should be our desire you say preacher what was his desire brother his desire was to fulfill the word that was written concerning him that's why he said amen suffered to be so for now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness amen can I preach to you a little bit amen it be cometh us look at this word becometh it means to be comely over the Wade to stand out when Jesus told John it's not now you see where I'm going when Jesus told John it's becoming of us brother Bobby was saying time it falls out it falls our lot to stand out to be conspicuous to be imminent to be seemingly to be fed in Hebrews 2 9 Paul says but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the Angels what was Jesus he was conspicuous he was made to stand out from the angels for the suffering of death crown with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man look at verse 10 for it became him it became him for whom were all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect suffering this in church it became him in other words young people amen it behooves us it falls our lot to fulfill all righteousness that's why David said thou maintaineth my light and in verse number 6 and psalm 16 6 he said and thy lines are Fallen unto me in Pleasant places thou lines are Fallen unto me in Pleasant places yea I have a goodly Heritage Brethren should remember me and the days are numbered my Lord is sent my Lord is set someday that's going to squeeze the body and the life of my body and I've got to meet Jesus another place oh you know and speaking the horses you know putting the bridle on them they know the work was coming well I'm just glad the Lord makes us a Workhorse so we can so we're never too tired to do something we're never too tired to do something for the Lord if it falls our Lord today listen young people you ain't got to go to some counselor Amen to find your lot of life you ain't got to search through 10 steps of dolesting or some or some psychology or some some Seminary amen the word of God is your inheritance the word of God is your life and your lot was sent before you was born the only thing you got to do is come face to face with God and recognize you got a position you got a purpose you got a lot you got something to do so you got to get off your excuses you got to get off well I come out of a broken home I didn't have a family I did amen you got to get rid of all of that that's not a part of your lot your lot is a greater lot your lot is a place of inheritance remember your reason for being is to fulfill the word I rebuke them mind battles I rebuke them right here right now in the name of Jesus Christ they shall not have authority they shall not have free reign in the minds of our young people your mind don't belong to the devil that belongs to God hello quick quit letting the devil live in your mind rent free evict him evict him kick him out well I know I know some of y'all want me to move on but I'm gonna I'm gonna go out to that devil and you can sit there and watch me you let them devils live in your mind rent free and there and oh God and every thought they plant you speak you know why because they want that thought to get out well amen that never moves in your mind and says no man the church loves you nobody cares for you amen and you're letting that dumb squatter live in your mind rent free you want to get some grit about you and take a stand and serve that devil eviction notice and say you will not live in my mind you will not live in my spirit you will not trespass on my soul I belong to God and I have a goodly Heritage I have a lot in life to fulfill I must know my position I must know my day and I'll stand there in it unwavering put the devil in his place come on Church put the devil in his place if he's in your mind he's out of his place if he's on your shoulder he's out of this place if he's in your spirit he's out of this place the devil belongs underneath your foot then put put your foot on that therefore put that devil in his place show him who you are you're a Son of God you're a messiah you're a part of the heritage of God now I'm going to take a few minutes here and I'm going to hurry but I'm going to lay this out to you no one knew his day Noah knew his position and you know what no one knew he knew brother it was becoming of him to build the ark he knew the plan for his day Noah was criticized but listen what the prophet of God saying he said no matter how much they saved they're so they're such and there's no such a thing as the Holy Ghost there's no such a thing as Divine heal him it behootheth us it is becoming to us that we fulfill all righteousness are you ready for this that we stand in this hour of trial and pound away at the Ark of the Lord what are you saying preacher I'm saying this what is becoming to the believer is Unbecoming to the critic and what is Unbecoming to the critic is becoming to the believer that's why Peter said amen knowing this verse that there shall come in the last days scoffers who will walk after their own lust Jude 1 16 there are murmurs complainers I hope they're not here murmurous complainers walking after their own lust and their mouths speaketh great swelling words having men's persons in admiration because of Advantage but beloved remember ye The Words which were spoken before the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ how did they told you there should be mockers in the last time we should who should walk after their own ungodly lust can I say this to you it become just as it becomes John to baptize Jesus it becomes the critic to criticize it falls their lot that's what they was brought on the earth to do was criticized well brother Andrew I tell you what one of these days precious name when they quit criticizing me I'm gonna do something for god well I'll see you in another 10 years of time tarries and you'll still be saying the same thing because the critic is never going to stop criticizing no matter if you call them up and ask them how they wanted it done and did everything to the T they would still find some little something that didn't get done and they would criticize you but you got to learn to walk as a Believer and if you're going to walk as a Believer you've got to walk unconscious of criticism the Bible said that Jesus had given us an example that we should do unto others as he has done to you remember I said now watch are you ready for this anybody ever been criticized three of you four of you you ever been criticized he said when he came in the world when there was more as much unbelief in this world right then as there ever was it didn't even slow him up he went right on preaching just the same healing just the same it never bothered him there was critics the man was criticized from the time he was a baby until he died on the cross did it stop him no sir well let me say this if criticism didn't stop the head it will not stop the body if criticism didn't stop Mr Jesus Christ it will not stop Mrs Jesus it was because of Daniel amen it was becoming of Daniel to stand for the word in the face of idolatry amen it was becoming of a Christian to be it's it's Unbecoming of a Christian to be ashamed I love what Paul says he says listen church I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ it is the power of God and the Salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek brother said because it's becoming to a Christian not to be ashamed of your religion come on young people lose your lose your embarrassment of this message lose your embarrassment of the church you go to come on I'm going to preach to you amen you got to lose that you got to quit getting all blessed you know all red face when somebody asks you what you believe come on you got to take a stand and you got to let this world know I believe this message and you got to know what you believe from the Bible so you can back every devil in the corner up and say this is not a man's idea let's just not following men's words for Advantage this is following Vindicated word it's a it's a oh God and I'm not ashamed of this message I'm not ashamed of this prophet I might as well go attack another devil while I'm here and don't ever be ashamed of the church God put you in amen can I take some Liberty don't you ever be ashamed if God puts you in a word based message teaching Holy Ghost Field fire baptized church that believes this message and gives this message premium don't you let some devil of carnal comparisons amen anoint you to compare your church with some other church and say well if this church he do this and if that's her well God I'm here I might as well preach and now it's got down to where well if this church ain't doing this it's a dead church and if that church ain't doing this amen but when in God's name did we put the measuring stick in the hand that some preacher to identify what is life and what is death what identifies life and what identifies death is the message of the hour and if the church is in the word of God you want to get behind the vision it's a devil that crawling out of the pits of Hell of carnal comparisons they don't do it like we do well they ain't you listen I've been evangelizing I started preaching when I was 13. I've been been traveling since I was 16 by myself on the road preaching I preached in churches God's give me Grace to preach in churches all over this world but you know what I can't do I cannot come to Lula and see how they do it Lula and go to go to go to Alabama and tell them how to do it in Alabama like they did in Lula all right come on church I cannot go to Canada and tell them to do it in Canada like we do in Virginia every church is Sovereign in itself [Music] you know what brings us on the same page is the message of the hour so if we're all preaching the message then we ought to be able to go in each other's church and have good Fellowship because the basis of Fellowship I hope that's okay the basis of Fellowship is the message that's why Paul was saying don't you ever be ashamed of the Gospel that's what you are not ashamed of the Gospel it's the thing are you ready for this it's the thing that holds in the hours when the ship is rocking and every stars outside and the moon and the stars and the storms are blowing but it still holds it's the Gospel of Jesus Christ in Genesis 22 it was becoming of Abraham when he walked up there to sacrifice Isaac it was becoming of Abraham to separate from unbelief and acts the second chapter it was becoming of the disciples at Pentecost to go to the upper room and to receive power in Acts 3 it was becoming a Peter and to John to speak the word over the lame man it's a gate called Beautiful it fell there a lot now I'm going to close on this one said look here at Enoch in paragraph 126 it become a first to fulfill our is this okay to fulfill our righteousness in the days of Enoch just before the flood when Enoch looked out there and saw Noah building away on the ark Enoch was a prophet now watch Enoch knew that he was a type Enoch knew that he was a type and he knew that before the floods came that he had to give an example so one afternoon it was becoming to him to take a walk brother brother Wade it was becoming of Enoch it fell his lot it behooved him it was conspicuous of him to be to be translated without seeing death because Enoch knew he was a type of rapture he meant to go before the floods came can I can I lay some word to you young people it's in Genesis 5 22 the Bible said that Enoch walked with God after he began Methuselah 300 years and he began Sons and Daughters listen Enoch was a family man he had a wife he had babies he had grandbabies but all the days of Enoch were 360 and five years but in all that brother brother in all that Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him you know what Enoch means it means dedicated you know what no matter how dedicated Enoch was he was still in a battle you know what he did he battled with the position listen sometimes we're going to battle with the position that God called us to but Enoch was an example that whatever position God calls you to you can walk with God if he calls you to be a preacher you're going to walk with God if he calls you to be a Sunday school teacher you've got to walk with God if he calls you to be a housewife come on Church you're going to walk with God because how is he not walking brother Louise by faith my faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before somebody preached with me now before before before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God not after he was translated but before he was translated he could testify that his life was pleasing to God you know what the prophet of God said he said faith is unconscious you've got faith and don't even know it that's right Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a storm and the gaels were knocking the boat from one side of the other or he was standing in the face of masses of demons if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right along just as calm and quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear or anything around him that's right whether it's going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knowed it was going to happen because God said so he didn't say oh wonder if I prayed through wonder if I fasted long enough wonder if I did this he just walked right on unconscious what are you saying preacher Spoken Word Church walking shoes home put your walking shoes on it's time to quit sitting there letting every bit of criticism that flies by amen stop you from walking it's time to make some footsteps it's time to take some important of inheritance come on young people put your walking shoes on it's time to walk in Joy it's time to walk in faith it's time to walk in Revelation it's time to walk in forgiveness it's time to walk in Liberty it's time to walk in Freedom it's time to walk in peace it's time to walk in authority listen you called to walk with God oh God you gotta walk with God church he walk with God he walked right on unconscious he believed what God Said was the truth are you ready for this the words must be fulfilled he knows what his life was to fulfill them that's right turn the corner he said that's right about Jesus that's right Lord that's right Lord Jesus that's right you want you that's right Lord you had to walk that's right well that's right Lord but you're here to fulfill it too direct quote you're here to fulfill it too so just walk unconscious of fear it's here yeah but you're not focused on it walk unconscious of criticism are you ready for this walk unconscious of the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right or left hand just keep moving on are you ready for this if something comes up in the church get on the phone and call everybody and have you heard the latest what does so-and-so say did you see brother so and so it's not what my Prophet said if something comes up in the church walk with God if sickness tracks you walk with God if the neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep on Walking with God Enoch one day walk like that you know what he done he walked all the way home with God he was so far off the road he didn't want to come back anymore walk with God if the doctor says you're going to die just walk with God if the doctor says you can't get well just walk with God for God has promised you I'll never leave you or forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the world and he took an oath by the Covenant that he give you that he confirmed to you just walk with God you ready for this you'll have your ups and downs don't worry you'll go through your Briar patches over shop rocks over Bluffs down on the hillsides up through the mountains over Waters but walk with God listen Enoch had a wife he had kids he had a life he had grandbabies he had troubles he had situations but he walked with God program says this he'd gone for a stroll he never took the old familiar path he took the King's Highway went on to Glory it was becoming of him to do so you ready for this he didn't want to leave Enoch didn't want to leave but yet it was becoming to him to fulfill all righteousness because he was the type of the church today he was the type of the church is going to take an afternoon stroll we're going to strike the King's Highway and Away we'll go it was becoming of everyone in the Bible to stand then can I say this to you now somebody say now it's becoming of us to stand he said now it's becoming to us in this day we know we've just been through the church ages we know we've received the Holy Ghost we know that beyond the shadow of a doubt we know we have the gospel out the prophet said it'll be light in the evening time we know this everything she was given the message we see it Vindicated with signs we know we're at the end of the way out of sin age we know that National Strife science wonders are appearing everywhere we know we're at the end time God bearing witness and it behooveth us it's becoming to us that we fulfill all righteousness now we're at the last hour We're in the laodicean church age every ages message has been given the message is in his age and we're here at the end that God has Vindicated with signs and wonders and nobody can say it isn't so he's here now he's here in the church he's in the people nobody can say this and so we know he's here so it behooveth us to take his word it behooveth us to believe all righteousness it's behooving to us it's becoming to us that we fulfill everything he spoke of the church is weak the churches of today he said but we know that with same purifier that led Israel man that same Ministry that accompanied Jesus Christ by that Pillar of Fire that had him anointed is a company in the church today scientists proved it we didn't need that but God proved it we need the ministry of Jesus Christ to fit that headstone coming Yonder that's brought the church into a place where this ministry is exactly like it was when Jesus left let our musicians come this afternoon what are you saying preacher I'm saying it's your turn to stand Noah stood Enoch stood Daniel stood Paul stood Peter stood brother branhamsted now it's your turn to stand there it's your turn to stand I want you once you stand with us this afternoon it's your turn to stand you know I wanna I wanna leave this with you right here when you brother Brandon says it very beautiful he says now when you say I believe Jesus Christ is my healer I believe this morning he's going to heal my sick body something told me to come to church I'm here among the Believers I'm taking my stand this morning I believe it I'm going up to be prayed for now what I'm prayed for they're on that stand I'll remain no matter how dark it gets or where it's at it's what I want it's what I want you to take home with you Church I'll still stand on that stand I'll still stand on that stand you took your stand because it's becoming to you after you once made a confession you must stay with your confession that's right it's behooving you as a Christian as a Believer to stay with your conviction don't let the devil push you off here and there you're always muddied up you're always off the main road you're always in and out that's why you can't stay nowhere you can't have confidence in yourself or you can't no one can have confidence in you you've got to stand and when you've done all you can do to stand then stand amen just keep on standing that's right we must do that it's becoming to us it's behooving us that we do it how many can say I want to stand there amen I take my stand my position is my stand amen my position my inheritance will not be taken from me I'm going to take my stand Peter did that's right Enoch did he said brother Andrew they all had it easy they were Bible characters they had it all they had it all easy brother Zach I mean it was just easy for them what are you doing brother said Enoch didn't want to leave do you realize Enoch left his family when he didn't want to to fulfill a type for you because there had to be a top for the seventh from Adam to take a change one day without seeing death there had to be somebody walk like Enoch walked there had to be there had to be somebody so it fell Enoch's lot to do it and he didn't want to leave his family he didn't want to leave his wife he loved his home probably they had to walk what are you saying I'm saying there's going to be times you got to do things you don't want to do but it behooves you to do it part of your lot so what do you do not do it and not fulfill the will of God or say Lord I'm gonna put my nose to it I've been anointed to fulfill this position there's going to be a resurrection there's going to be a rapture there's going to be a new heavens and a new Earth there's going to be a body change there's going to be a marriage supper of the Lamb and only the righteous will be there can I say it this way only the ones who fulfilled his word in the age and day they were living we'll be a part of it how many say Lord give me courage Lord give me courage give me courage sometimes I just get to thinking brother Bob where would we be had people give up their stand yeah where would we be I think about you in this church where would you be today if brother Dale give up his stand somewhere along the way just backed up a little bit and said well you know I guess we could probably read but he stood there declaring this message you know why because it failed his lot well it follows your life to stand in your home to uphold convictions in your home I don't know why I'm here but I'm here on this point right here do not tamper with an eternally right word for a temporary situation don't tamper with it well but then we're just going to change a few things here in the message in the word we're going to do a few things yeah I had a guy tell me that one time he said oh God I get in trouble he told me he said yeah he said brother and he said I got a television I said oh really he said yeah he said yeah when I said my son growing up he said I think he had like three or four or five boys you know had some Sons he said yeah he said I had a my son he said he wanted television he said we wouldn't get one because you know brother I'm taught not to have one that's why that's what he taught he said well I got one I said Well why'd you do that he said well I found out my son was going over to other people's houses watching it and so he thought well I just bring one in the house and he can watch it here and we'll be at least he'll know what he's watching you know I'm sitting there scratching my head I'm thinking they're all out of the house and the television's still in there hello we'll just give up a little bit here and it's okay and then before long the devil gets a foothold come on Daddy's makeup comes in your homie might as well stand with a profit because we gotta go eat the message is Right regardless of the situation regardless of who it is what home what family the message is right so if you stand on the message then you'll always be right but if you change it a little bit well we're gonna give a little Grace well it's a message of Grace So stand on it stand on your stand how many can say today Lord I want to take a stand I don't just want to make a stand I want to take a stand put my nose to them enemies put my nose to them trials and stand in my position unwavering focused moving forward let's bow our hearts together today Heavenly Father we love you today Lord father we thank you for this message that you've sent us we thank you for the truth of your

college working maybe already on the job Force wherever they're at Lord but father I believe you've called us to be courageous believers Lord I believe you've called us to stand to stand when we've done all that we can to stand just stand Lord I pray you would bless every one of these young people father I pray that if the devil has moved into their Spirit their minds and is living their rent free I pray that you would give them the Grace today Lord to take the promise of Ephesians 4 27 neither give place to the devil and drive that devil out of their mind drive that devil out of their Spirit Lord if that devil supplied them with thoughts it's bringing them down they can't worship they can't believe your word I pray today God may your anoint him Lord may your anointing break the enemy's whole over the life of the young person father I pray for our elders here today Lord maybe some not here some streaming or we'll go back and hear the archive archived Lord I pray father I pray Lord that though they would be getting up in years Lord and no doubt tired from the battle but Lord I pray you would continue to give him the grace to stand Lord we as the Next Generation Fallen we need somebody to look up to Lord we need to see some Elders that knew how to stand in hard times to stand when things were falling apart when there was troubles and situations and issues in the church or issues in the lives but Lord they knew how to stand father we need that courage Lord presented before us give our brothers and sisters the grace father we commit this congregation into your hands Lord may you give this church the grace to continue to stand Lord we don't know what's in front of him we don't know what tomorrow or next month or the next month holds but we know who holds it so

stand brother wait I want to stand like now like never before I want to stand God bless you today [Music] so let your kingdom come yes let it live in me this is my prayer this is my plea let the worshipers arise today and let the sons and the daughters see I'm surrendering my oh yes Hallelujah I surrender to the king let the worshipers arise oh let the worshipers arise [Music] and the daughters [Music] oh pause but I hear it going [Music] every day never [Music] here [Music] there's always a generation let the worshipers all right sing it to him [Music] let the worshipers arise [Music] oh father I see the Lamborghinis people [Music] but of the seals [Music] [Applause] [Music] I surrendered once again [Music] generation of the sons and that the generation of the people that's going to take a Rapture and a body change [Music] amen you love the Lord let the worshiper arise come up out of this place I was thinking when you was preaching I thought man that's true God has never there's always been a cycle of God somewhere on the Earth amen may not have been in your generation at where you were standing but in somebody's generation there always was a bride amen when he come under their Pentecost he never put a gap anywhere because God's moving all the time he's moving he's moving through his people and you think well who well if you figure out it's you then you don't have to worry about anybody else hey man Enoch kind of figured out he said there's something going on here and uh I don't know I don't know what's going on but I gotta go amen because the Bible said he walked with God he didn't surround he walked with God that's right and he was not amen because God took him well that's what he's doing in the every generation God took a people but he's going to take a people by a body change correct destroying death where they stand on their own two feet it could be a young kid could be an old guy it really doesn't matter what does that matter to God but we're heading towards something we're walking as our brother said this it's a paradox though Paul said let's run but our brother said let's stand well it's the same identical thing that's right because you're not standing sleeping you're you're taking a stand on what you believe right right amen amen and as we move forward you take a stand as you move forward like I said every generation I've got a little sermon on that that's good now every generation though Aina left his generation but there was still a generation of people that came through Methuselah all the different ones and that's why the Bible gives you genealogy tells you that God has been he just there's a big strand of God that just he just pulled it out and said I'm gonna have people everywhere there's not going to be a gap and I'm gonna put the best at the last that's right I'm gonna put the best that's the last that can handle it they can take it Enoch took it then we're going to take it now but it's by listening to the word of God it's the washing of the Water by the word you're not going to get it any other way you're gonna get you're going to get watched by the word can't get it sitting at home no no you gotta get on the fountain that's right this is the fountain that's right Elijah brother said the the message of the hour is what we stand on and if it's true then we're true that's right amen I like my brother Ernie Villanueva always said he said we have plugged ourselves into the Eternal and that's what I like because it's Eternal and you decide and you plug yourself into that well guess what that does that puts the current back inside of you and makes you oh wow anytime you touch Eternal hey eternity is the only thing that can come from it and man so we we have we have plugged ourselves into the Eternal and then we're just Eternal people that think different talk different act different and we look different yes amen so let's give our brother another big ham and God bless him he's always poured his heart out he's always been a somebody that stands for the truth and I appreciate that and always have appreciated him since he was I've known him since he was about 14 years old when somebody when brother uh Bill yountz had to haul him around to preach and I remember that kid so it but he stood for the word even as a young kid when other people were you know doing other things he was studying the message and it sure has made an impact on the world he said he's going to New Zealand in about another month so let's just pray for him there there and and over in the
