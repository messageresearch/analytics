[27:30] you'll find him he'll be somewhere it
[27:33] amen good to see everybody in the house
[27:35] of the Lord you'd like turn in your
[27:37] scriptures turn back where we were this
[27:39] morning Revelations 3 and John 14 we
[27:44] didn't get to the message this morning
[27:47] so we just made a little addition in and
[27:50] you know hope it helps you to understand
[27:53] a little bit
[27:54] where I am and what I do and try to do
[27:58] do and maybe it'll open her eyes to
[28:01] something because there's no way that a
[28:04] human mortal can interpret the word of
[28:08] God I don't care if it was brother
[28:10] brandom or who it was he couldn't
[28:12] interpret the
[28:13] word but he said when it comes to
[28:16] Pi there's your interpretation so then
[28:20] we know and believe what we're talking
[28:22] about what that nobody can interpret but
[28:25] what we do we try to explain
[28:29] what we see and then God takes that and
[28:33] can reveal himself to you from what
[28:37] we're trying to explain not what we're
[28:38] trying to interpret cuz you can't do it
[28:41] the interpretation is the revelation of
[28:43] it so we're we're tied to that point I
[28:46] hope you follow that this morning right
[28:49] father we thank you for this day and we
[28:51] pray that you would just be with each
[28:53] and every one of us this afternoon and
[28:55] that you'd open our eyes to that
[28:57] understanding Lord of Thy word that we
[28:59] may see you and want to walk in your
[29:01] love forgive our sins and cleanse us and
[29:03] keep us Lord and help us to walk in you
[29:06] be with those that are not with us some
[29:08] sick different things Lord and know and
[29:10] just bless each one just have your way
[29:13] Lord with each and every one of us be
[29:15] with the Thomas family there and the
[29:16] loss of the brother and just remember
[29:19] the family there Lord and take care of
[29:21] them and just have your way with each
[29:23] one of us we love you and we thank you
[29:25] and we commit it all to you now in Jesus
[29:27] Jesus name amen
[29:30] amen Revelations
[29:34] 3:14 and then we'll go to John
[29:37] 14 and unto the angel of the Church of
[29:40] the lady oan right these things sayith
[29:42] the amen the faithful and true
[29:45] witness who is he the beginning of the
[29:48] creation of God all right let's go to
[29:51] John
[29:52] 14 and begin about the 11th
[29:56] verse
[29:58] believe me that I am in the father and
[30:00] the father in me or else believe me for
[30:03] the very work sake verily verily I say
[30:07] unto you he that believeth in me the
[30:10] works that I do shall he do also now
[30:12] what when he say up here for what
[30:14] believe him for the work sake The Works
[30:17] was proven who he was
[30:19] right now look what he says verely
[30:21] verely I say unto you he that believeth
[30:23] on me the
[30:26] works
[30:27] what that I do shall he do also and
[30:31] Greater Works than these shall he do
[30:35] because I go unto my father and that's
[30:38] the reason it can be done and whatsoever
[30:41] you shall ask in my name that will I do
[30:44] that the father may be glorified in the
[30:47] son if you shall ask anything in my name
[30:50] I will do it if you love me keep my
[30:53] Commandments and I will pray the father
[30:55] and he shall give you another your
[30:57] comforter that he may abide with you you
[31:01] forever even the spirit of Truth whom
[31:04] the world cannot receive because it
[31:06] seeth him not see because you don't have
[31:08] Christ in you you can't see what Christ
[31:10] is doing right because it seeth him not
[31:14] neither knoweth him but you know him for
[31:17] he dwelleth with you watch and shall be
[31:20] in
[31:22] you I will not leave you comfortless I
[31:24] won come to you yet a little while the
[31:27] world seeth me no more but you shall see
[31:29] me because I live you shall live also at
[31:34] that day this day right this
[31:37] day not we'll pick us more Wednesday
[31:40] night but at that day how why would he
[31:42] say at that day meaning this
[31:47] day you mean they're not supposed to
[31:49] understand until this day no that's not
[31:52] the point right it's not what he's
[31:54] saying at that day you shall know that I
[31:56] am in my father and ye in me and I in
[32:01] you you may be seated the Lord had his
[32:04] Blessing now what day would be that
[32:11] day the prophet said on Christ The
[32:13] Mystery of God revealed I believe it is
[32:16] he said the day of this Revelation
[32:18] that's right well now that would mean
[32:20] forever age and every time right so
[32:24] that's why I said now watch what he's
[32:26] saying
[32:27] he's explaining the whole
[32:30] Kingdom to come down into
[32:32] being not just this
[32:35] day but to be every day and every age
[32:40] would be to that place and that would be
[32:43] that day and it would find up wind up in
[32:46] its finality as what in this
[32:49] day the day the Revelation comes forth
[32:52] really that you can see what he's saying
[32:56] what he said I and you that can be
[32:59] understood that's the new birth but what
[33:02] about you and
[33:04] me he's he's emphasizing more something
[33:08] else that we've got to understand in our
[33:10] Christian Journey all right and as I
[33:14] said this morning I hope you will take
[33:16] that message and listen because you know
[33:20] people say uh well I can't understand
[33:24] brother Dale he's just so deep he's into
[33:27] these deep
[33:28] things that's I said this morning I've
[33:31] studied the message now for 50
[33:33] years and every day it's becoming more
[33:39] simple every day it's becoming more
[33:42] simple it's not becoming deeper that's
[33:46] what we
[33:47] think because if it's becoming deeper
[33:49] where are you going to run into it
[33:50] because Jesus said what did I say in
[33:52] this
[33:54] morning reveal it unto babes which would
[33:59] learn if it's deeper you ain't got a pro
[34:02] I mean you got
[34:03] troubles but if it's more simple then it
[34:05] just keeps coming
[34:07] down and coming to that point and after
[34:10] studying for 50 years it's more simple
[34:12] today in any time has ever been in my
[34:15] life to be able to see God's word and
[34:19] really see what it means because it
[34:21] means what it says and says what it
[34:25] means see we say but now I think this
[34:28] what who give us the right to
[34:31] think well that's the way you interpret
[34:33] it that's what I'm talking about this
[34:34] morning that's why I hope you
[34:36] listen nobody has a right to interpret
[34:38] God's word the interpretation is when
[34:40] it's made
[34:42] manifest when he said a virgin shall
[34:45] conceive that was never made manifest
[34:49] for for 4,000 years well we'll say 2,000
[34:54] years that scripture was not fulfilled
[34:58] but one day a virgin conceived you know
[35:01] what fulfillment of that scripture
[35:04] bringing it into a basis of reality so
[35:07] when the word is revealed to
[35:09] you there's your revelation of it so I
[35:12] hope you follow that thought and then
[35:14] maybe you'll get away from thinking well
[35:16] that's just too deep for me to
[35:17] understand what it means is you're
[35:19] trying to figure it
[35:20] out that's right I don't mind saying
[35:23] that because I've raised that I'm I'm
[35:25] born and raised in that human
[35:28] mind all of us was to try to figure
[35:31] things
[35:32] out that's what that we think is
[35:34] supposed to be we think the preacher he
[35:37] just supposed to figure it out a little
[35:39] different from the congregation I didn't
[35:42] know that I've never found out in the
[35:44] word of
[35:47] God I've always found that the minister
[35:50] was to be the servant amen I didn't know
[35:54] he was to be this the one to be served D
[35:57] yeah I thought he was supposed to be the
[35:59] servant to everything so that means I'm
[36:01] supposed to be the smallest there is
[36:05] right see you've got a whole week to
[36:07] read and study and listen to texes I can
[36:10] do that to a degree but I have to be
[36:14] thinking what's
[36:16] next see I'm set on a channel I'm having
[36:19] to think what's coming next then I have
[36:22] to study in that thought and pattern
[36:24] where you can just read and study all
[36:26] you want to and just have a wonderful
[36:28] time that's right and why not why
[36:31] wouldn't you want to do that I wish you
[36:33] would uh go back in especially because a
[36:36] lot today would be out and I've been a
[36:38] lot of I wish you would go to the
[36:39] Philadelphian Church age and listen to
[36:42] that
[36:43] one and then
[36:45] take the lady you'll see an age right
[36:47] after that and
[36:49] listen because that is a
[36:52] great understanding that was explained
[36:54] to us about a lot of things things and
[36:57] that's what we want to get into today
[36:59] cuz what I want to do is just kind of
[37:02] look at the things and see where we're
[37:07] at and we'll call it you know and I do
[37:10] this every once in a while but we'll
[37:11] call it review and preview cuz I like to
[37:15] review where we are to make sure cuz I'm
[37:19] like Paul it doesn't bother me to say
[37:22] things twice right you ought to know
[37:24] that by now it doesn't bother me to keep
[37:27] saying things over and over I do know a
[37:30] little bit about the human mind I hope I
[37:32] got one somewhere in the between the
[37:34] ears and you know what it is repetitive
[37:36] things can be
[37:38] remembered right that's the whole thing
[37:41] of schooling repetitive repetitive
[37:43] repetitive repetitive you know and it
[37:45] just becomes a part of you well that's
[37:47] all I want to do is to just this word of
[37:49] God to be so in inside of me until that
[37:55] it'll all be based upon what he says
[37:58] then we'll find out what the scripture
[37:59] says ask the father in my name because
[38:02] who's it asking is it you
[38:05] asking or is the father in you
[38:08] asking we do a lot of asking ourselves
[38:11] but if we get down to the basis of
[38:13] letting
[38:14] him he he's never turned down of prayer
[38:17] yet okay now let's get into a
[38:20] thought back a few weeks ago we begin to
[38:25] deal with some things of thinking
[38:28] about in the stature of a perfect man
[38:31] and I've asked you to listen to the
[38:34] messages like the adoptions to hear ye
[38:37] himm uh all of those get
[38:40] into
[38:43] uh Masterpiece se's not out with a Shook
[38:48] and those messages because we're going
[38:50] up to something in our understanding and
[38:52] we're climbing slowly into that position
[38:56] to understand all right and I I do that
[39:00] deliberately because that's the way I
[39:03] understand is I come up slowly and one
[39:06] thing picks up to the next and the next
[39:08] and and that's what I want to do all
[39:10] right but what what have we been talking
[39:12] about we was in the stature of a perfect
[39:14] man and trying to understand there in
[39:16] second Peter where it says add to your
[39:19] faith virtue knowledge temper patience
[39:21] godliness brotherly kindness and then
[39:24] the love of God and we went through
[39:26] through uh many services talking
[39:30] about that brother brandham when he made
[39:33] that drawing he made the drawing and he
[39:36] added to as we would look at it to the
[39:39] scriptural point because instead of
[39:42] going Faith virtue knowledge temper
[39:44] patient godliness the Bible says in
[39:46] brotherly kindness and in love see he
[39:48] draw it out Faith virt knowledge temper
[39:51] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[39:54] Holy Spirit and then love all right but
[39:58] then he'd turn around and he'd say but
[40:01] there's only seven
[40:03] ads you know that's right remember that
[40:06] there's only seven ads so we found out
[40:10] there was some keys there and the reason
[40:12] that the prophet was putting it there
[40:14] because that's exactly what it is the
[40:16] holy spirit is sealing these things into
[40:19] you as you are coming up and then it
[40:23] seals in then the head can come down
[40:26] they don't have to come down cuz that's
[40:28] what we're doing now what do we tell
[40:29] tell you the last few
[40:32] messages we're building up that filling
[40:35] that up with the message of the hour
[40:38] instead of trying to bring the head down
[40:40] we're filling up with the message of the
[40:41] hour we're letting the prophet bring the
[40:44] things and just build it up to where
[40:46] it's supposed to be all right so we
[40:48] found out then this say seven ad so we
[40:51] found out that birth the B New Birth is
[40:54] Faith so that's not an ad it does
[40:56] doesn't say add faith it says add to
[41:00] your
[41:01] faith virtue knowledge so then looking
[41:04] at the pyramid it's exactly right we
[41:06] have seven
[41:08] ads but there's eight manifestations of
[41:11] God in that that you're doing cuz what
[41:14] do you start the new birth is God made
[41:16] manifest in you first vir then come out
[41:19] to love the top and the bottom has got
[41:22] to be the same Stone because it is the
[41:25] chief
[41:26] Cornerstone let's see the prophet said
[41:29] in the church it's the Cornerstone in
[41:31] the complete church it's the fullness
[41:34] it's The Headstone all right so the the
[41:38] Cornerstone and The Headstone is the
[41:39] same Stone it's just the difference in
[41:41] position we'll get to that the Lord
[41:43] willing Wednesday and you'll see that
[41:45] the Cornerstone could only make
[41:49] manifest certain
[41:54] things or else why would you have a
[41:56] headstone waiting that's right we'll get
[41:58] to those things Wednesday and trying to
[42:01] understand a little bit all
[42:03] right then we went through the church
[42:06] ages because the prophet saying that the
[42:08] the individual comes up the same way the
[42:10] church ages comes up all right so he
[42:13] brought it out and we covered in the in
[42:15] the church ages that there were seven
[42:18] Church
[42:19] ages and seven only seven angels
[42:24] Messengers to those Church ages
[42:28] right but then we found
[42:31] out that there's eight manifestations of
[42:34] God now some of you that wasn't here
[42:37] I'll try to Endeavor to do a little bit
[42:41] but there's eight manifestations of God
[42:45] all right see then you got
[42:47] what Paul irus Mar clo and then you come
[42:51] up to this being the last age the lady
[42:54] of seean
[42:55] age but there's eight manifestations of
[42:58] God through those
[42:59] ages we cover that in a whole sermon
[43:02] I'll get back and read it in a minute to
[43:03] you because that is the key to
[43:06] understanding the Bible you know the end
[43:08] time the message that we talk
[43:11] about is to see that God manifest
[43:15] himself Through the Ages through the
[43:19] individuals as he's building a
[43:22] body for him to dwell in all right see
[43:26] because that's what it's made manifest
[43:28] for all right see then we got up to
[43:31] talking about moving up now what that
[43:35] the messenger would always come at the
[43:38] end of the
[43:39] age and that that would be the key to
[43:43] understanding I was thinking the other
[43:44] day about well let's see this morning I
[43:48] was thinking about you
[43:51] know as I tried to explain one day that
[43:55] John on patmas was told about the
[43:58] churches right there was a church out
[44:00] there there were seven churches out in
[44:02] that area that God used to express to
[44:06] John his thoughts okay all right now so
[44:11] as he brought them see we can understand
[44:15] how John knew the churches and he would
[44:18] call it the
[44:21] ages but I ask you how would brother
[44:23] brand how was it that he knew the
[44:25] messenger
[44:28] well I got thinking about something else
[44:29] on
[44:30] there how did Brother randam know the
[44:33] time
[44:40] wise how did he know the TimeWise he
[44:43] could pick up thoughts from different
[44:46] ones and bring in at this that or the
[44:49] other but it's like I said remember
[44:54] Columba was not even in the age
[45:00] period right but yet he was picked as a
[45:03] church age
[45:05] messenger I got to thinking about that
[45:08] this morning while I was waiting on my
[45:09] wife to get ready to come and I I
[45:12] thought
[45:13] Lord the prophet said the pattern was
[45:17] the one that stayed closest to the
[45:19] truth all right now we dealing with the
[45:22] messenger the one that stayed the
[45:24] closest to the truth
[45:26] and I thought how was it that and I told
[45:29] you he had some help in reading some
[45:32] things and picking some
[45:34] dates but yet he was the one that gave
[45:36] the dates right of how long those ages
[45:42] lasted and I was sitting there thinking
[45:44] I said
[45:46] Lord there's got to be a key
[45:50] there you know what that key
[45:54] is
[45:56] let me examplify it as one why would uh
[46:01] Elias be called a lady of cnh
[46:06] H why would it be
[46:10] that because it would perfectly fit the
[46:14] times
[46:16] right
[46:18] right what is it people's
[46:22] rights perfectly fits the age
[46:28] right read your church ages and look at
[46:32] the message to that
[46:34] age and look all it all God had to do
[46:39] was to take that man's thinking and
[46:42] place it right into watching them
[46:45] scriptures and he'd look at that
[46:47] scripture and he'd say this age ends
[46:50] right
[46:51] here in this age starts right
[46:54] here
[46:56] cuz he would know the condition the
[46:59] existence and the things that happened
[47:01] during that period of
[47:04] time
[47:06] right and see you come over to what is
[47:08] it Columba that was the longest one of
[47:10] those come through the Dark
[47:14] Ages a thousand years or 1500 years
[47:16] right it of Dark
[47:18] Ages see the holy spirit says you see
[47:21] that that's the Dark
[47:23] Ages and he says yes that fits right
[47:26] here and that's this man's
[47:30] message I I I like it when he opens up
[47:34] things to where that I can see what is
[47:37] transpiring and see then the man was not
[47:40] sitting picking it himself that's
[47:43] right it would be the scripture related
[47:47] for whatever the age is right we'll get
[47:49] to it in a minute bringing it down Paul
[47:51] come at the end of the
[47:53] age to rebuke
[47:58] right and read that first church age he
[48:01] said you have left your first
[48:07] love it's
[48:09] Revelations is it 2:4 some we're right
[48:12] in there it's in the first church
[48:14] yet that identically
[48:17] places the time and what was taking
[48:21] place and shows right where we're at
[48:23] okay but now we went through it to show
[48:27] what that there's seven Church
[48:31] ages so we count out on the per
[48:34] individual Faith virtue knowledge
[48:36] Temperance patience Godly brotherly
[48:38] kindness and love makes
[48:41] eight manifestations of God in your
[48:46] life but then you back up to seven ads
[48:50] and you realize that faith is not an
[48:54] ad it does say add
[48:57] love there's your
[49:00] key it doesn't say love will just it
[49:04] says
[49:06] add love that's your seventh one which
[49:09] is love all right so looking at the
[49:12] church ages what do you
[49:16] got you got seven Church ages but you
[49:20] got the headstone left
[49:22] off you say well where's the eight
[49:24] manifestations of God that's what I
[49:26] showed you your Prophet tells you how it
[49:31] is God was manifested in those things
[49:34] and then when it come down to
[49:36] the last
[49:39] age in the last Church age you had a
[49:43] wonderful thing happen that ausa
[49:46] street brought the
[49:49] message the prophet said no Messenger to
[49:52] the
[49:53] age he said CA the Holy Spirit came
[49:58] itself he said then after all at the End
[50:01] of the Age the messenger sent so now you
[50:04] got eight manifestations of God cuz you
[50:06] got to have that to make eternal
[50:08] life that don't mean nothing probably to
[50:11] you or your thoughts but it really does
[50:13] to me to hold a whole point all right
[50:16] now we'll get back in a minute to some
[50:17] of this and we'll reread but what I want
[50:20] you to see is what what was we dealing
[50:22] with the past couple of
[50:24] services how
[50:27] that when you say age you know an age a
[50:31] Time Philadelphian age you know ladies
[50:33] see and age the word
[50:35] age means time right you're not talking
[50:40] about how old you're talking about the
[50:43] word age is a word signifying
[50:47] time aging is time it takes time to age
[50:51] you know all right see then as it's
[50:53] doing then
[50:56] there's been the seven Church
[51:02] ages
[51:04] right but the bride has never been in an
[51:07] age that's
[51:11] right you can't put the bride in an
[51:14] age physically speaking
[51:18] yes physically speaking every age was an
[51:22] age with time and recordings of it and
[51:25] 24 hours a day and we're living now in
[51:28] the lady oan age cuz there's not another
[51:32] age Beyond this
[51:34] age but that's physically
[51:37] speaking but by the baptism of the Holy
[51:40] Ghost by the new birth in your soul your
[51:43] soul is already in the Eighth Day by
[51:46] that new birth are eternal life well
[51:49] don't you believe Paul's birth don't you
[51:51] think Paul had a new birth don't you
[51:53] think irenius had a new birth don't you
[51:55] think think don't you think all them
[51:56] people down through there had the new
[51:58] birn well see that how can you put the
[52:00] bride in an age you say well that don't
[52:02] mean nothing to me about a bride in agel
[52:04] it certainly does to me amen it means a
[52:07] drastic thing CU it means that here I am
[52:12] while I'm in lady yosia getting older
[52:14] every day but yet inside of me is one
[52:17] being
[52:19] formed he ain't getting younger right he
[52:23] was young to start with cuz he was
[52:27] eternal all we got to do is get them two
[52:31] together and that's why the ages had to
[52:35] be like they were to bring it out to in
[52:38] this
[52:41] age in this
[52:43] age comes to a wonderful
[52:48] time but yet it's believing what the
[52:52] prophet says like I said there's big men
[52:54] big people people preachers that'll tell
[52:59] you zeusa Street they didn't have
[53:02] nothing they had the
[53:05] gifts brother brandham said they had the
[53:08] Holy Ghost in his fullness in the
[53:14] baptism that's not an
[53:18] interpretation
[53:20] okay you see one of that thought this
[53:22] morning was laying on me it's not an
[53:28] interpretation it's a
[53:31] revelation and the Revelation is
[53:35] eternal it's not an
[53:37] interpretation to think about the bride
[53:39] being in each age being in the
[53:42] bride Paul and them was in The Bride
[53:45] right called out of the
[53:49] age right that's right into eternal life
[53:54] right
[53:58] right body was still in
[54:00] time going to the
[54:03] grave but I thought we believed there
[54:05] was going to be a time that somebody
[54:07] wouldn't do
[54:08] that so there has to be some reason for
[54:12] it to take place and it does in this
[54:15] age so had to have the key to that all
[54:18] right now the bride is called out of the
[54:21] age because she's called into eternal
[54:23] life by the new birth
[54:26] right all right now see then that's why
[54:29] you see that brother says on 49 future
[54:33] home believe that's right he says the
[54:36] soul is
[54:37] redeemed but said we're waiting the
[54:40] Redemption of the
[54:41] body now that don't need interpreting
[54:44] does
[54:46] it
[54:48] right you believe your soul is Redeemed
[54:51] by the new birth
[54:53] okay then
[54:55] we know for certain we're still in
[54:58] time and tied up with this getting older
[55:01] that's right right you ain't look in the
[55:04] mirror when you get home okay look the
[55:08] next day you'll start seeing chicken
[55:10] fingers and line marks and things
[55:12] that'll show a whole lot of things
[55:13] getting older all right but listen by
[55:16] the new
[55:18] birth I said this would be a review
[55:20] preview by the New Birth the bride
[55:27] is in eternal life in her
[55:29] soul but in her body she's still in time
[55:32] yes all right now that's why watch that
[55:37] we've been dealing with why the
[55:40] messenger would always come at the end
[55:43] of the
[55:47] age right
[55:50] right that's what your Prophet said over
[55:52] and over right you don't believe it
[55:54] going into pH left in age and you'll
[55:56] find 90% of what I'm talking about see
[55:59] the messenger always came at the End of
[56:02] the
[56:05] Age all right and brought the message to
[56:08] the
[56:10] people so he called him
[56:12] out
[56:16] right he called him
[56:18] out you have been called
[56:21] out of this
[56:23] age if you just believe
[56:26] it don't try to interpret the thought
[56:29] just believe
[56:30] it well I just don't see how that come
[56:33] on see that's what I
[56:35] mean take what he's saying that's
[56:40] right why can't we believe what brother
[56:44] randam has
[56:45] said right well I believe
[56:52] it but why are you always trying to
[56:54] figure it out that's right
[56:57] right if you believe it why are you
[56:59] trying to figure it
[57:03] out it don't need to be interpreted
[57:06] that's
[57:11] right all right now
[57:14] listen when the messenger came at the
[57:16] end of the age is the key to eternal
[57:19] life that is present to you and I in the
[57:22] soul for one thing but then to step into
[57:25] eternal life
[57:27] physically someone's going to have to do
[57:29] that right why don't we contend we are
[57:32] one of them all
[57:34] right but see we we don't listen we want
[57:38] to figure out I watch some of you some
[57:42] are sitting and looking and wondering
[57:44] what's he saying some are saying yeah he
[57:46] going to go in yeah got and I said don't
[57:50] don't read just
[57:53] listen what you
[57:56] think that's human
[57:58] beings and I'm not beating on you I'm
[58:01] just telling
[58:03] you I got in trouble one time I said put
[58:06] your pencils up and quit writing don't
[58:09] tell me I can't
[58:14] right I didn't say
[58:17] that it's almost virtually impossible to
[58:20] write while you're
[58:23] thinking you see you think but you
[58:25] better be thinking about what you're
[58:28] writing
[58:30] right come on uh sister where's she at

[59:28] you get
[59:31] home you will get three words right and
[59:35] the rest of it will be wrong till you

[59:40] over that and you'll have him saying
[59:42] thing he ain't never even thought of let

[1:00:04] pocket cuz it'll bring it back to me
[1:00:07] later see I'm just asking you to
[1:00:11] listen and this morning was what I was
[1:00:13] saying not to try to
[1:00:15] interpret but to listen what a the man
[1:00:18] would be bringing to
[1:00:21] us and you might find out it's not such
[1:00:23] a big mster
[1:00:26] you might find out it's something
[1:00:33] simple
[1:00:36] see the messenger coming to the end of
[1:00:38] the age well you go one way you go the
[1:00:41] other way which way you do we put the
[1:00:42] drawing up we had that we won't do
[1:00:46] that but Paul came at the end of what
[1:00:52] age see you'd say well Paul came end of
[1:00:55] Ephesus well how could he bring the
[1:00:57] message to Ephesus if he came at the end
[1:00:59] of
[1:01:02] Ephesus
[1:01:03] right and who did he rebuke that's
[1:01:09] right right I gave this the other day I
[1:01:13] had a bunch more but I wonder if you
[1:01:15] thought about what brother BR said Paul
[1:01:19] done pull up number one and let's just
[1:01:21] read a little bit is this the sign of
[1:01:23] the end sir
[1:01:28] Paul was the first messenger the first
[1:01:30] trumpet sounded the first seal broke Lo
[1:01:33] Paul was the first Messenger as we found
[1:01:36] and what did he do declared war on
[1:01:44] what did you read that when we was doing
[1:01:48] it other
[1:01:49] day I said just a few words and went
[1:01:52] on what is the Orthodox
[1:02:00] Church
[1:02:04] oh so brother R said he declared war on
[1:02:07] the Orthodox Church he rebuked the
[1:02:09] Orthodox
[1:02:13] Church oh I know all about politic but
[1:02:16] who was he
[1:02:18] rebuking now you watch him he's going to
[1:02:21] do two
[1:02:23] things with carry that on over till
[1:02:25] Wednesday night he's going to rebuke two
[1:02:32] groups Orthodox Church who is that for
[1:02:37] not believing the Messiah sign that
[1:02:40] Jesus had produced to
[1:02:44] them so that's the Old Testament Church
[1:02:47] right the Orthodox don't worry about it
[1:02:49] I got them here right now okay don't say
[1:02:52] well I don't know what that means I not
[1:02:53] well I got them right here here so we'll
[1:02:54] read them in a minute
[1:02:56] okay so take my word until we get
[1:02:59] there all right so who does Paul
[1:03:06] rebuke he rebukes the Old Testament
[1:03:11] Church for not believing the Messiah
[1:03:14] sign of Jesus
[1:03:17] Christ Paul was a great
[1:03:20] man no wonder they hated him no wonder
[1:03:24] they tried to kill him every time he
[1:03:25] turned around look what the man was
[1:03:31] doing you realize in those
[1:03:34] synagogues churches and things that
[1:03:36] while Jesus was alive and preaching you
[1:03:39] ever read your Bible you know that it
[1:03:40] says a lot of the Pharisees or believed
[1:03:46] him in the read your Bible a lot of them
[1:03:50] believed him but where where were they
[1:03:53] later on as he begin to say I and my
[1:03:56] father is
[1:03:59] one
[1:04:01] right you know I've often wondered about
[1:04:03] we think about the the synagogues I
[1:04:06] wonder sometimes how that's handled
[1:04:08] because we think that it must have been
[1:04:10] a a set strict run of case evidently it
[1:04:13] wasn't you remember Jesus as his custom
[1:04:18] was never went to school today in his
[1:04:20] life be learning how to read somewhere
[1:04:23] and he says as his custom
[1:04:27] was he went into church and read to
[1:04:30] them don't you know what he must have
[1:04:32] been a pretty popular
[1:04:34] reader maybe they like the way he
[1:04:37] read come
[1:04:39] on they didn't come in just have a
[1:04:41] church and they looked at their they
[1:04:43] looked at this they do no evidently
[1:04:45] every group was a little bit
[1:04:47] different evidently had some pretty good
[1:04:49] discussions read the book of Acts how
[1:04:52] Paul would go into those Sy OG
[1:04:55] right you remember Paul one time was
[1:04:59] going along with them until they asked
[1:05:02] him to shave his head
[1:05:06] yes he backed out study your Bible then
[1:05:11] when the prophet says something it'll
[1:05:13] ring a bell who was Paul rebuking who
[1:05:16] did he declare war on cuz a messenger
[1:05:19] rebukes the age or time prior and brings
[1:05:22] a message right
[1:05:25] Paul was rebuking the Old Testament
[1:05:28] people from getting away from the Messi
[1:05:31] sign that Jesus had brought they should
[1:05:34] have known
[1:05:35] him remember Paul came at the End of the
[1:05:38] Age all the messengers come at the end
[1:05:40] of the age it's at the end time when
[1:05:43] these things are brought forth Paul
[1:05:46] knowing the
[1:05:49] scriptures and knowing that Jesus was
[1:05:53] Messiah and he blasted those
[1:05:56] synagogues from place to place with the
[1:06:02] scriptures and was put out of every one
[1:06:04] of
[1:06:06] them who did he rebuke the Orthodox
[1:06:10] Church who is the Orthodox Church go
[1:06:14] ahead number two questions and answers
[1:06:16] law having a
[1:06:17] shadow we'll see in a few moments she's
[1:06:19] the Jewish Orthodox Church the wife of
[1:06:22] God the begotten
[1:06:25] who was the wife of God the begotten the
[1:06:28] Old Testament Saints
[1:06:30] people the Orthodox Church hey I've got
[1:06:33] a little bit I can read there's 22 times
[1:06:35] R around and talks about Orthodox and
[1:06:37] one or two of those times he brings
[1:06:39] Orthodox over into our day cuz Orthodox
[1:06:42] means a group of
[1:06:44] people that are set to a Doctrine or
[1:06:47] idea okay but who's he talking about
[1:06:51] who's Paul
[1:06:52] rebuking go going well stay in that one
[1:06:55] run it on
[1:06:58] up now there's the Jewish Orthodox
[1:07:01] Church as the law is fading out the
[1:07:04] gospel is coming in so now you know what
[1:07:06] it is right so was everybody satisfied
[1:07:10] with the fact that Paul rebuked the
[1:07:12] Orthodox the Old Testament
[1:07:15] people you see yeah but he was way on
[1:07:18] over he he was over a little bit P
[1:07:22] Calvary
[1:07:25] but let me ask you a
[1:07:27] question why was it he finally turned it
[1:07:30] we'll read in a minute and he said you
[1:07:33] can't
[1:07:36] unworthily he said lo I turn to the
[1:07:44] Gentiles the seven Church ages are
[1:07:47] Gentiles I don't care if they're Jewish
[1:07:49] descendants or whatever but they're
[1:07:52] Gentiles right right I don't care if the
[1:07:55] biggest portion of that age was Jew it's
[1:07:57] Gentiles Gentiles means
[1:07:59] Nations that's why you had the secrets
[1:08:01] of Paul writing and them about the age
[1:08:04] and the doing but you everybody
[1:08:06] understand before
[1:08:09] Paul could do
[1:08:11] this he wanted to give the people
[1:08:13] something he had to leave a high
[1:08:16] position he had in the church of his day
[1:08:19] to stay with the word that's right
[1:08:25] who is Paul
[1:08:29] rebuking the Old Testament
[1:08:31] Saints the people the Old Testament
[1:08:34] people the rabbis the priests the guys
[1:08:37] and with
[1:08:40] him and he finished his
[1:08:43] message to
[1:08:46] them cuz come on Paul was a Jew he went
[1:08:49] to his own the same as Jesus that said
[1:08:51] he went to his own his own Paul went to
[1:08:53] his own yes right Paul stayed with the
[1:08:57] Jews and and stayed with them and stayed
[1:08:59] with
[1:09:01] them but then one day he say lo I turn
[1:09:05] to the Gentiles roll that up where they
[1:09:07] can read 3A acts 13
[1:09:11] 40 6-
[1:09:15] 48 look you count yourselves Unworthy of
[1:09:19] everlasting life Lo we turn to the
[1:09:22] Gentiles
[1:09:25] you know that there was a lot of
[1:09:26] argument in the book of Acts read the
[1:09:28] book of Acts there were a lot of
[1:09:29] argument among the
[1:09:31] Believers socalled in the book of Acts
[1:09:35] they were arguing who was the greatest
[1:09:36] they were arguing who was this and over
[1:09:40] that a few years after Calvary a few
[1:09:43] years after Jesus Christ they were
[1:09:46] already arguing over who was to be in
[1:09:50] charge read the book of Acts that's
[1:09:53] right Paul comes in the book of
[1:09:58] Acts Paul begin to nail that Orthodox
[1:10:01] Church behind there for not believing
[1:10:04] Jesus Christ to be the Messiah right but
[1:10:07] then what did he turn to when that
[1:10:10] scripture started to be fulfilled who
[1:10:12] did he turn to why does it bring it that
[1:10:16] way he said that the word have should
[1:10:19] have been spoken to you Paul and
[1:10:21] Barnabas whacked bold and said it was
[1:10:23] necess that the word of God should first
[1:10:25] have been spoken to you to the Jews
[1:10:28] right but you but seeing you put it from
[1:10:32] you now this man's in the New
[1:10:35] Testament he's rebuked the past right
[1:10:39] for not believe in Christ now who's he
[1:10:44] rebuking who's Paul rebuking
[1:10:47] now those in the book of Acts
[1:10:51] that's come on that's why he comes at
[1:10:53] the end of the age he didn't come at the
[1:10:56] end of Ephesus he come at the winding
[1:10:59] down of the Old Testament and the book
[1:11:01] of Acts and then he declared his message
[1:11:04] even brother brandham stating the fact
[1:11:06] that he started in 53 ad as the time
[1:11:09] because he said that was when Paul
[1:11:11] started his missionary journey probably
[1:11:14] when this started I don't know cuz
[1:11:16] that's no business no word but he said
[1:11:19] that's right you judge yourselves
[1:11:21] Unworthy of everlasting life he wasn't
[1:11:24] just talking to the Old Testament people
[1:11:26] he was now in the book of
[1:11:28] Acts rebuking those in the book of Acts
[1:11:33] what cuz what could he do the
[1:11:36] Corinthians even after coming on over
[1:11:37] later what were they Corinthians means
[1:11:40] book of
[1:11:44] Correction they want to know who the
[1:11:46] father ain't it kind of like you here
[1:11:48] you know what it was when we first come
[1:11:50] in the message who do we
[1:11:51] follow the prophets G
[1:11:54] 6768 who do we
[1:11:56] follow the prophet's gone who's the
[1:11:59] messenger to take us
[1:12:01] over some of you older ones remember
[1:12:07] that but
[1:12:09] look you count yourself Unworthy of the
[1:12:11] Gospel Lo we turn to the Gentiles watch
[1:12:14] him why did he turn
[1:12:16] that
[1:12:18] look it was necessary it happen you
[1:12:21] judge yourself unworthy
[1:12:24] so so for so hath the Lord commanded us
[1:12:28] saying I have set thee be a light to the
[1:12:31] Gentiles that thou shouldest be for
[1:12:35] salvation unto the ends of the Earth and
[1:12:37] when the Gentiles heard this they were
[1:12:40] glad and glorified the word of the Lord
[1:12:43] as many as were ordained to eternal life
[1:12:48] believed who was Paul
[1:12:51] rebuking if you get him anchored then
[1:12:53] the rest of the ages and the things will
[1:12:55] fall in place and you'll see it come out
[1:12:58] perfect but if you bring him down here
[1:13:00] at the end of
[1:13:03] Ephesus you got him a lot of problem
[1:13:05] trying to do and brother Brandon won't
[1:13:07] line you
[1:13:10] up if you don't understand what I'm
[1:13:12] saying brother Brown was lining it
[1:13:15] up all right you remember this quote
[1:13:18] that we gave I said this is preview
[1:13:20] review and preview go ahead to number
[1:13:22] four
[1:13:24] you remember this from the first
[1:13:27] seal then Along Came the Pentecostal age
[1:13:29] with the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:32] that's why I kept on that so much to all
[1:13:34] of these saying oh they didn't have
[1:13:36] nothing brother R said they had the Holy
[1:13:38] Spirit you can talk to him do what you
[1:13:40] want to it's nothing to me look and they
[1:13:42] cabbage down on that now there cannot be
[1:13:46] no more ages that's all of it that's the
[1:13:48] philadel or the not the the ladies in
[1:13:51] age but the we found in the study of the
[1:13:54] scripture that the messenger to the age
[1:13:56] come right at the end of the age ever
[1:13:59] time Paul come at the End of the
[1:14:01] Age watching we find out irenius come at
[1:14:05] the End of the
[1:14:06] Age
[1:14:08] Martin End of the Age Now watch him
[1:14:10] place it Luther the end of the Catholic
[1:14:15] age there is no Catholic age listed in
[1:14:20] ages Luther come at the end of the
[1:14:22] thousand
[1:14:23] years of the dark ages of the Catholic
[1:14:28] church
[1:14:31] right well look and what Wesley at the
[1:14:36] end of the Lutheran
[1:14:44] age now Wesley come at the end of the
[1:14:46] Lutheran
[1:14:49] age then that's place in your ages
[1:14:56] see we want to make it back here trying
[1:14:58] to go now make it right with the prophet
[1:15:00] and then you got it right and at the end
[1:15:02] of the Lutheran age watch and Pentecost
[1:15:07] he puts it he don't tie the two at the
[1:15:10] end of that age of sanctification
[1:15:12] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost at
[1:15:14] the end of the Pentecostal age we're
[1:15:17] supposed to receive according to the
[1:15:20] scriptures a
[1:15:22] messenger now your messenger comes at
[1:15:24] the end of the
[1:15:30] age you say well that doesn't mean
[1:15:33] anything to me then Christianity doesn't
[1:15:36] mean anything to you
[1:15:40] either
[1:15:42] oh but you're just being sarcastic well
[1:15:45] what are
[1:15:48] you don't you want to know the
[1:15:51] truth you said well how in the world is
[1:15:53] that going to help us to do anything
[1:15:55] help us to find out where the messengers
[1:15:57] at cuz we got to be where the messengers
[1:15:59] at remember that we got to be where the
[1:16:03] messengers at in Martin Luther's age it
[1:16:06] was no good to stay in the Catholic age
[1:16:08] prior and claim to believe Martin
[1:16:09] Luther's
[1:16:11] message we got to be where the messenger
[1:16:14] was at where's the
[1:16:16] messenger I thought according to the
[1:16:19] Bible that he was put out of the lady
[1:16:23] you see in church age that's
[1:16:28] right that's what I
[1:16:30] thought well where are we supposed to
[1:16:34] be TimeWise living in lady
[1:16:39] oia
[1:16:41] wordwise we at least be confessing where
[1:16:43] we're
[1:16:44] at now listen I'm going to say it so
[1:16:49] listen for three messages I've been
[1:16:52] trying to drive a
[1:16:56] point and that point is if we don't
[1:16:59] recognize right exactly where we're at
[1:17:03] and what we're doing then don't talk
[1:17:05] about the
[1:17:12] message if we don't start saying who we
[1:17:16] are then why don't you start saying who
[1:17:19] you ain't because that's what you're
[1:17:22] doing
[1:17:26] if I call the names of the brothers that
[1:17:29] preached at Pentecost was false most of
[1:17:31] you would get mad at me get up and walk
[1:17:40] out but yet they're the
[1:17:44] brothers all
[1:17:47] right but look when brother brandham
[1:17:51] explains that Wesley come at the end of
[1:17:53] the Lutheran
[1:17:55] age that's enough right there to explain
[1:17:58] the
[1:17:59] ages and that Paul came to
[1:18:03] rebuke the Orthodox
[1:18:06] church and the people in the book of
[1:18:09] Acts for getting away from God's
[1:18:14] word and he turned to the
[1:18:17] Gentiles thank God he turned to the
[1:18:20] Gentiles right
[1:18:23] amen because he turned to me and you
[1:18:26] okay go ahead to the next one which is 4
[1:18:28] a this is Anointed ones at the end time
[1:18:31] read this one real
[1:18:34] careful you see church I try to bring
[1:18:36] prizes to you and bring things you know
[1:18:39] prize parts to point for you to see it I
[1:18:42] don't go and bring you ever quote I wish
[1:18:45] you would go
[1:18:51] read Bob Bo a go come and handed me a
[1:18:53] piece of paper where I talking about the
[1:18:55] other day how that one Prophet always
[1:18:57] lined up his message with one prior you
[1:18:59] know what he landed me a
[1:19:02] copy we know I like
[1:19:07] that I like
[1:19:11] that Joe brought me a list I asked him
[1:19:14] to this morning to look up a few things
[1:19:16] about something that had been
[1:19:19] questioned you know what he brought me a
[1:19:21] list I like for you to get
[1:19:26] involved
[1:19:28] right you know what your soul is
[1:19:32] involved okay listen Revelations 10 said
[1:19:36] in the days of the sounding of the
[1:19:38] seventh angel I'll reread this in a
[1:19:40] minute but I want the rest part now
[1:19:42] remember seventh latest in church age
[1:19:45] the sounding of that angel when that
[1:19:47] church age is done denominated and
[1:19:50] become a church age when it's done in
[1:19:54] its Pentecostal
[1:19:56] organization when the messenger to that
[1:19:59] now watch you what was each messenger
[1:20:03] what was Martin Luther a rebuke to the
[1:20:06] Catholic and watch him what was Wesley a
[1:20:11] rebuke to them
[1:20:17] lutherans so to be a rebuke to the
[1:20:19] lutherans he comes to end of the
[1:20:21] Lutheran age yeah but but if he's in the
[1:20:24] Lutheran age he's wrong age you don't
[1:20:26] get the
[1:20:31] overlap you don't get the point the
[1:20:33] prophet explains an overlap for
[1:20:38] us
[1:20:42] right you see do you believe what he
[1:20:46] says do you believe go ahead to the next
[1:20:49] one what is it it rebuke the Pentecost
[1:20:52] so he's going through the Shu the Grain
[1:20:54] and all we're going to
[1:20:57] rebuke this whole Pentecostal thing when
[1:21:00] we become the
[1:21:02] grain The Messengers done Del delivered
[1:21:05] his message go ahead to number four
[1:21:07] number five I've read this over and over
[1:21:10] to you but do you believe it you see
[1:21:12] each one of those ages only taking a dip
[1:21:13] into the Holy Spirit justification is a
[1:21:15] work of the Holy Spirit sanctification
[1:21:17] is the work of the Holy Spirit but the
[1:21:18] baptism is the holy spirit that's the
[1:21:21] reason it took reason that's the reason
[1:21:25] it took a prophetic Prophet to come
[1:21:30] down that's not brother random keep
[1:21:33] reading no Messenger to the
[1:21:37] age right C the Holy Ghost came himself
[1:21:43] in his fullness of the
[1:21:49] baptism and know you know yourself that
[1:21:51] a lot of people said Zeus didn't have
[1:21:54] anything go talk to some of these
[1:21:56] preachers
[1:21:59] about and you know what they're
[1:22:02] saying and some of you know it for
[1:22:05] certain that they're saying we don't
[1:22:07] have what they had at
[1:22:10] Pentecost talking about back
[1:22:13] under now if we don't have that we're
[1:22:16] not born again that's right that's
[1:22:21] right you know what I said to a man that
[1:22:23] told me that he said brother Dale what
[1:22:26] do you think is wrong cuz he just got
[1:22:29] through telling me that we didn't have
[1:22:31] the baptism of the Holy Ghost like they
[1:22:32] had in the book of Acts he said what do
[1:22:34] you think's wrong I said I'm going to
[1:22:36] tell you exactly what I think wrong most
[1:22:38] of the people in this message don't have
[1:22:39] the baptism with the Holy
[1:22:41] Ghost I still hold that
[1:22:44] today if they had the baptism with the
[1:22:46] Holy Ghost it wouldn't have so many
[1:22:48] twisted up
[1:22:51] ideas
[1:22:54] look see that's the reason it took he's
[1:22:56] talking about the bapt
[1:22:58] sanctification work but the baptism is
[1:23:01] the holy spirit where did the baptism
[1:23:02] come Luther Wesley Pentecost that's the
[1:23:07] reason it took a prophetic Prophet to
[1:23:08] come down no Messenger to the age
[1:23:10] because the Holy Ghost came himself in
[1:23:12] his fullness of the
[1:23:15] baptism zeusa
[1:23:17] Street with the fullness of the
[1:23:21] baptism
[1:23:23] just like the book of
[1:23:26] Acts because if not what is it
[1:23:30] like look but at the end of the age as
[1:23:34] it always ends upon the others we find
[1:23:36] in there the Messenger s and all these
[1:23:40] Scruples and things are to be placed in
[1:23:45] their places like that then the Rapture
[1:23:49] comes for the church W who was to come
[1:23:53] and to tie up all the Loose
[1:23:56] Ends the
[1:23:58] messenger that we claim to be Willam
[1:24:03] Brad
[1:24:05] right well I just can't place that
[1:24:07] together that means you're trying to
[1:24:09] figure it out so you're not reading it
[1:24:11] to take what he
[1:24:13] says the same way we read acts 238 and
[1:24:17] Matthew 28:19 and swore by it and
[1:24:20] baptized in the name of Father Son and
[1:24:22] Holy Ghost
[1:24:28] devil don't change his
[1:24:32] tactics but
[1:24:35] listen I ain't going to be able to read
[1:24:37] a lot of it cuz I've read it to you
[1:24:39] before so I'll scan down and read and
[1:24:41] you just listen if you want these I gave
[1:24:44] them to you last
[1:24:45] Sunday You're supposed to have
[1:24:49] them I ain't going to ask for whole show
[1:24:52] hands of how many kept
[1:25:01] them we see the messenger always comes
[1:25:03] at the end of the age he comes back to
[1:25:06] rebuke them each age like that that
[1:25:11] makes a lap over in each one of the
[1:25:14] church
[1:25:15] ages Philadelphian Church age I'm
[1:25:18] reading from a lap
[1:25:21] over
[1:25:23] why lap over between each
[1:25:27] age listen
[1:25:30] folks the bride is not in the
[1:25:33] age even the drawing that was made by
[1:25:36] brother brandom after what was put on
[1:25:39] the wall at the
[1:25:41] Tabernacle the last one showed it total
[1:25:47] darkness he said I left a little
[1:25:51] light
[1:25:52] right that wasn't no bride was
[1:25:55] it Brides were the lights at you
[1:25:58] remember it started off big went down
[1:26:00] and
[1:26:02] my no bride's ever been in the age
[1:26:05] folks she's been into the bride age for
[1:26:09] her age she's been in the overlap
[1:26:11] between the
[1:26:12] ages
[1:26:16] listen in between the open door was set
[1:26:20] in between the last two ages
[1:26:24] it wasn't was not in Philadelphia I mean
[1:26:26] it was not in yeah Philadelphia and it
[1:26:29] wasn't in lady OA it was in
[1:26:32] between in the lap
[1:26:35] over the lap over is where you messenger
[1:26:38] stands your lap over is where your bride
[1:26:41] better
[1:26:48] stand but you see we're not looking at
[1:26:50] it like that
[1:26:52] what was that open door that comes in
[1:26:55] each one of those leftovers that we
[1:26:57] covered the other day Philadelphian
[1:26:59] Church age what is the open door the
[1:27:02] revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus
[1:27:07] Christ you remember how the prophet in
[1:27:10] the Philadelphian age said it he said he
[1:27:12] started off in the first age declaring
[1:27:14] to them his name
[1:27:16] y he said he comes back in the sixth
[1:27:19] Church age declaring his name
[1:27:25] the name of Jesus he said begin to be
[1:27:28] restored not in lady oia he said in the
[1:27:32] lap over
[1:27:34] between now let me say it like this
[1:27:37] who's standing in that lap over between
[1:27:40] lady Osa I mean Philadelphia and lady
[1:27:45] oia you better put what he said that the
[1:27:48] Holy Ghost came himself who's the one to
[1:27:51] bring his name
[1:27:53] back like I said we're so carnal though
[1:27:56] we fight with words we said well the
[1:27:58] name of Jesus was lost I guess they call
[1:27:59] it Jim Joe
[1:28:01] Charlie it wasn't the name spelling of
[1:28:05] the name it was the revelation of the
[1:28:07] name and who that
[1:28:10] was the open
[1:28:14] door standing
[1:28:17] there the angel of the lady oan Church
[1:28:21] to end it
[1:28:27] up and on down P the end of the age and
[1:28:30] on down End of the Age the lap over End
[1:28:33] of the Age End of the Age that's what
[1:28:36] makes it
[1:28:39] lap what makes a life
[1:28:45] over
[1:28:47] uh what's the lap over he talking about
[1:28:49] on the ladder rungs of a ladder right
[1:28:55] right right rungs of a
[1:28:59] ladder where's the rungs of a
[1:29:05] ladder I mean you got a bottom you don't
[1:29:08] put a rung
[1:29:09] right you don't put one down on the
[1:29:11] bottom right they raise up about that
[1:29:14] far and you put a step and you call that
[1:29:17] a rung on the
[1:29:19] ladder where's it at it's between the
[1:29:22] bottom and the next
[1:29:24] part
[1:29:27] right it's like climbing a ladder to
[1:29:29] Prophet
[1:29:31] said you step up on the first rung of
[1:29:34] the
[1:29:35] ladder don't do like brother H and come
[1:29:38] down and decide you don't need that to
[1:29:40] below and just step off you'll get your
[1:29:44] leg
[1:29:46] broke we better come back down the way
[1:29:48] we go up all right rather than an Abrupt
[1:29:53] end and a clear-cut
[1:29:56] start you have an
[1:29:58] overlap where one Church age just Fades
[1:30:01] into the other
[1:30:05] one I told you and you don't listen and
[1:30:07] pay attention to it CU it took me a long
[1:30:09] time for that to sink in brother
[1:30:11] brandham
[1:30:12] said God dwelt with Israel 40 years
[1:30:19] after
[1:30:20] Calvary do you need that
[1:30:24] quote he was still dealing with Israel
[1:30:27] until Titus destroyed
[1:30:30] Jerusalem now I told you what don't try
[1:30:33] to figure it out cuz you will he didn't
[1:30:36] have salvation to
[1:30:39] him but he was still healing them
[1:30:41] fighting for him right you know what
[1:30:44] they don't believe him now you know what
[1:30:46] he's doing he's healing them you know
[1:30:48] what he's doing he's fighting for
[1:30:50] them right why because they're his
[1:30:54] people see church we need to be called
[1:30:57] out into the lap over between each age
[1:31:00] and you'll see then Paul came right here
[1:31:02] irenius Martin Columba Luther Wesley
[1:31:06] here the Holy Ghost came right here on
[1:31:09] theusa street and then right here your
[1:31:12] Elijah
[1:31:14] comes to stand between Time and
[1:31:20] Eternity you said brother Brown was a
[1:31:23] messenger to Lady
[1:31:27] oia he said that wasn't
[1:31:31] correct on the Feast of the trumpets if
[1:31:33] I come with a message of Pentecost I
[1:31:35] would be in the ladyo church age and
[1:31:38] that wouldn't be
[1:31:42] right I gave you these
[1:31:45] quotes but listen do you follow it yes
[1:31:49] Have you listened to what I've said
[1:31:51] about him
[1:31:52] yes that brother Brandon's message was
[1:31:55] in two
[1:31:56] parts according to 327 Church age book
[1:32:00] One turn the hearts of the children back
[1:32:02] to the faith of the father two reveal
[1:32:04] the seven Thunders which is a revelation
[1:32:06] contained in the seven seal it'll be
[1:32:08] these divinely revealed truths that
[1:32:10] literally turn us back so the only way
[1:32:13] we're going to get turned back to Faith
[1:32:14] of the fathers is for those seals to
[1:32:16] break to you and I right righten
[1:32:22] two things he's doing two things Paul
[1:32:24] was doing Paul was rebuking That Old
[1:32:27] Testament
[1:32:28] people but then he turned to those
[1:32:33] people in the synagogues and the thing
[1:32:36] that was claiming to believe Jesus
[1:32:37] Christ claiming to believe the New
[1:32:40] Testament
[1:32:41] message but they wouldn't have it
[1:32:43] correctly and Paul said I turn to the
[1:32:50] Gentiles
[1:32:55] what about brother brandham when he said
[1:33:01] that that the last day message would
[1:33:03] have to have the
[1:33:06] identification as Elijah
[1:33:10] had it would turn the hearts of the
[1:33:14] people not to the denominations but back
[1:33:17] to the original Apostolic fathers back
[1:33:21] to the word trying to do God a service
[1:33:23] without his
[1:33:24] will then M them Mysteries will be
[1:33:27] revealed in the last days when the
[1:33:29] seventh Angels seventh Angel's message
[1:33:33] when he not when he starts out doing
[1:33:36] this but when he begins to sound his
[1:33:40] message them Mysteries are to be
[1:33:43] revealed and here they are not knowing
[1:33:47] them and you people are a witness of
[1:33:50] that
[1:33:52] so brother randam what did I say the
[1:33:54] other day he did he had to turn the
[1:33:56] people back to the faith of the fathers
[1:33:58] before he could talk about the
[1:34:00] seals he rebuked the Pentecostals for
[1:34:03] getting away from their
[1:34:06] message and his message began in the
[1:34:09] seals
[1:34:11] right go on and read
[1:34:13] Rapture top of the seven Church ages
[1:34:16] when in Revelation 10:7 that the great
[1:34:18] mystery of the book was to be unfolded
[1:34:20] by the seventh angel message now there's
[1:34:23] a messenger above always and a messenger
[1:34:25] on Earth the English word angel means a
[1:34:28] messenger and in the seventh Angel's
[1:34:31] message while he was making his
[1:34:34] proclaiming his
[1:34:37] ministry then when he began to sound
[1:34:40] forth his ministry not when he started
[1:34:47] out what about
[1:34:50] it
[1:34:52] Rapture he gets on later and he says
[1:34:55] talking about his message he said all
[1:34:57] the time knowing backd under the healing
[1:35:00] and so forth like that was just to catch
[1:35:03] the people's
[1:35:04] attention knowing the message would come
[1:35:09] and here it is and them Seven Seals
[1:35:12] opened those Mysteries showing those
[1:35:16] things is what happened he said I didn't
[1:35:19] know it
[1:35:23] right come on let's be
[1:35:25] honest brother randam preached the seals
[1:35:27] in in 56 or somewhere there where he
[1:35:32] preached on them you when he came down
[1:35:34] it's about 56 where he was doing and he
[1:35:37] said I preached them like four he said
[1:35:39] like put four of them together you know
[1:35:40] and
[1:35:43] he we see then God showed him that that
[1:35:45] wasn't right cuz you know what he
[1:35:47] preached the white horse
[1:35:49] rider was the Holy Spirit that's right
[1:35:52] why because the seals had never been
[1:35:53] broke that's he thought they
[1:35:56] had that's why he come up with the idea
[1:35:59] that there was Seven Seals in the book
[1:36:01] and Seven Seals on the outside the
[1:36:05] book he said until I found out
[1:36:08] later that couldn't be he said because
[1:36:11] you'd be adding to the
[1:36:13] word so it had to be just the Seven
[1:36:18] Seals the Seven Seals was his message to
[1:36:21] bring
[1:36:22] to you and I and then like I've asked
[1:36:24] you to do I've asked you to just sit
[1:36:27] down and read the titles of the
[1:36:33] sermons after the seals
[1:36:37] broke and they're all dealing with
[1:36:39] eternal
[1:36:41] life why because he
[1:36:44] came right
[1:36:46] here to stand between man and
[1:36:53] eternity this message is to stand
[1:36:58] between all
[1:37:01] right he said not in the Pentecostal
[1:37:04] age this is not the P you remember the
[1:37:07] last on I gave you this is not the
[1:37:09] Pentecostal age this is the bright age
[1:37:13] this is the evening light this is when
[1:37:15] Malachi 4 must be
[1:37:19] fulfilled we're not in l we're in Lady
[1:37:21] oia Lady oia physically but we're not
[1:37:25] in lady oia we're not in the
[1:37:30] Pentecostal
[1:37:32] age we got something different the word
[1:37:36] now watching listen to this one you
[1:37:38] remember
[1:37:40] it listen real careful the word that
[1:37:43] fell on the day of Pentecost will not
[1:37:46] work this day pull that up if you want
[1:37:48] to Invisible Union number
[1:37:50] 22 and they can read
[1:37:54] it no
[1:37:56] sir that was for
[1:37:59] Pentecost watch
[1:38:01] him this is for the bride going home
[1:38:04] with the bride we got something
[1:38:06] different the Pentecostals represented
[1:38:10] that
[1:38:11] again we're in the bright age who did
[1:38:13] the Pentecostal
[1:38:16] represent According To Masterpiece and
[1:38:18] Seed not a with a sh brother randam says
[1:38:20] Mary was not the seed that's right but
[1:38:24] she was a carrier
[1:38:26] amen he said Mary
[1:38:30] represented
[1:38:32] Pentecost that's right
[1:38:35] amen the Pentecostals is the Mary he's
[1:38:38] talking
[1:38:41] about the Pentecostals represented Mary
[1:38:46] because they were carriers but we got
[1:38:48] we've got to become the
[1:38:49] word huh we got something
[1:38:57] different do you want to hold on in that
[1:39:00] denomination because your mother and
[1:39:03] grandmother held on that she comes out
[1:39:07] of something to come into that that was
[1:39:11] the light of that day that like in the
[1:39:14] times of
[1:39:16] Noah modern events made clear by
[1:39:19] prophecy what about at
[1:39:25] church he says on that message paragraph
[1:39:27] 3:17 may want to find it look what he
[1:39:30] says this is not the day of Pentecost
[1:39:33] the Pentecostal age is
[1:39:36] passed Pentecost is gone this is the
[1:39:40] Harvest
[1:39:44] Time Harvest
[1:39:48] Time no longer an age
[1:39:52] very close to eternal life
[1:39:56] physically but just needs a couple of
[1:39:58] more
[1:39:59] steps right why because the combine has
[1:40:03] got to come together the wheat but you
[1:40:06] know what the combine also
[1:40:11] does brother B said I hear the coming of
[1:40:14] the
[1:40:16] combine the World Council of churches
[1:40:19] you need that quote that's
[1:40:22] direct he said I hear the coming of the
[1:40:25] combine cuz you know what a combine does
[1:40:28] it does two
[1:40:32] things it gathers the
[1:40:35] wheat right and it binds the to
[1:40:41] stock the stock and everything goes out
[1:40:45] the wheat comes and you run another
[1:40:47] vehicle right alongs side of and it
[1:40:49] falls over in there
[1:40:51] I can hear the coming of the combine he
[1:40:53] said the World Council of churches why
[1:40:56] cuz they're going to push us into that
[1:40:57] one day that's right are you looking
[1:41:01] forward to times no but I just wish it
[1:41:04] come
[1:41:05] on cuz I am getting tired of this
[1:41:10] situation what are you looking for then
[1:41:12] brother Brandon brother BR well that's
[1:41:15] what brother R what he's looking for go
[1:41:16] to L by
[1:41:19] him
[1:41:21] the Dynamics of this church will be a
[1:41:24] refilling of the Holy Ghost holy
[1:41:28] spirit that we have worked in a small
[1:41:32] measure while The Headstone is coming
[1:41:35] down to unite with the
[1:41:38] body but when that head and body unites
[1:41:41] together the full power of the Holy
[1:41:45] Ghost would raise her up just exactly
[1:41:48] like that even the Dead
[1:41:51] he said that's dead in
[1:41:54] Christ what are you looking
[1:41:57] for I used to quote this statement and
[1:42:00] I've quoted it and I'll keep quoting it
[1:42:03] probably the same way but I had to
[1:42:05] correct a little difference in a
[1:42:07] wording I always said it like
[1:42:10] this I said the prophet said one day
[1:42:12] there'll come s a baptism of the Holy
[1:42:14] Ghost it'll fill over fiber of your
[1:42:16] being and take you in the
[1:42:19] rapture I still believe that I just
[1:42:23] looked it up to make sure cuz sometimes
[1:42:26] you're quoting from what you had in your
[1:42:28] memory for 50 years
[1:42:30] ago I wish you would pull the last two
[1:42:33] which is 25 and 26 off the message
[1:42:37] called
[1:42:39] Oneness 1962 what is it you got to get
[1:42:42] with the word get yourself killed out
[1:42:45] I'm persuaded that many of us friends
[1:42:48] have received the Holy Ghost
[1:42:52] but we just receive enough holy ghost in
[1:42:55] us to make us to a place where we don't
[1:42:58] want to lie we don't want to steal we
[1:43:01] want to don't want to do
[1:43:03] anything now that's your
[1:43:07] Prophet but God wants to fill every
[1:43:09] fiber of his
[1:43:12] church now watch him he wants to fill
[1:43:15] your thinking he wants to fill your mind
[1:43:18] he wants to fill every bit of you just
[1:43:21] make you completely totally dead to
[1:43:23] yourself or to your thinking your so
[1:43:27] surrendered in God till his word's just
[1:43:30] living right through you you don't know
[1:43:33] nothing else but God's word just stay
[1:43:36] right with his word it is his life but
[1:43:40] he wants to fill every fiber of the
[1:43:42] church now go on to the next one it's
[1:43:44] the same message that was paragraph 189
[1:43:47] is paragraph 298 209 here we are in the
[1:43:51] end time coming from the East and West
[1:43:53] North and the South what are we doing
[1:43:55] getting ready for that Rapture getting
[1:43:57] ready for holding ourselves steady for a
[1:44:00] few minutes till every fiber is filled
[1:44:03] with the Holy Ghost then she'll go
[1:44:07] up I misquoted it as saying youever fi
[1:44:11] of your being and take us in the
[1:44:13] Rapture so I said okay I'll go back and
[1:44:15] make sure everybody understands you
[1:44:17] know but is that what he said
[1:44:21] feel every fi of our being Amen to take
[1:44:24] us out of
[1:44:25] here you so are you looking for that
[1:44:28] I've always look for that from the day I
[1:44:30] read
[1:44:31] that well it don't sound like I listen
[1:44:35] to you preach it don't sound like you're
[1:44:37] looking for something I will tell you
[1:44:40] something right now that next that
[1:44:42] Wednesday and from there after you're
[1:44:44] going to think I'm not looking for
[1:44:47] something to
[1:44:48] come as long as you're you're looking
[1:44:51] for something to
[1:44:53] come you cannot have faith in what is
[1:44:56] taking
[1:44:59] place but if you'll get in what is
[1:45:02] taking place then you can have faith for
[1:45:06] what is to
[1:45:08] come did you catch the what I said
[1:45:13] it if you're in what's going on you can
[1:45:16] have faith for something but if you're
[1:45:18] not in what's going on you can't have
[1:45:20] faith for what's coming you're only
[1:45:22] taking what somebody
[1:45:28] said you know if we're not the people
[1:45:30] that God fills every fiber of our being
[1:45:33] evidently we're not going to be
[1:45:36] there that
[1:45:38] right so you know who that's left up to
[1:45:41] you and
[1:45:44] I to make ourselves available to where
[1:45:47] God can fill every fiber of our being
[1:45:51] with his
[1:45:52] word just remember that until Wednesday
[1:45:55] if you're not looking at what's taking
[1:45:59] place and you can't see what's taking
[1:46:01] place
[1:46:04] now and I ain't talking about Hillary in
[1:46:09] the White
[1:46:12] House I made my statement to my wife and
[1:46:15] some of them if she have picked a woman
[1:46:17] for vice president that have throw her
[1:46:19] out she now picked a man to be her vice
[1:46:22] president she's smarter than you
[1:46:25] think she wanted a woman for a vice
[1:46:30] president but the big guy says don't do
[1:46:33] it ain't
[1:46:36] time I've said I hope she gets it if
[1:46:39] she's the one if not I hope they pick
[1:46:44] somebody else cuz I want to get out of
[1:46:49] here
[1:46:53] right but you see that's what I've
[1:46:55] always been the prophet said a woman in
[1:46:58] the white house everybody's waiting on a
[1:46:59] woman in the white house right you know
[1:47:03] what I am
[1:47:04] too but you know what all these years
[1:47:06] ain't been sitting down well when the
[1:47:08] woman gets in the white house I'll start
[1:47:10] reading I'll start
[1:47:13] studying because you be
[1:47:16] ready no because you won't be in the
[1:47:19] word of the age
[1:47:21] that's right if we're in the word of if
[1:47:22] we're not in the word of the age there's
[1:47:24] no need to worry about anything
[1:47:27] else you can have all the quotes right
[1:47:29] you can have all the statements
[1:47:32] right and still be as lost as anybody
[1:47:36] can
[1:47:39] be you see what I talking about this
[1:47:42] morning if it ain't
[1:47:45] revealed is a
[1:47:49] quote and if it's revealed it can be
[1:47:51] made
[1:47:54] manifest but if it ain't revealed it
[1:47:56] can't be made manifest that's
[1:48:02] senseful so you say but I don't
[1:48:05] understand cuz you'll say this and you
[1:48:06] try to make it look like it was the
[1:48:08] emphasis do you know where you're
[1:48:14] standing do you know where you're
[1:48:19] standing
[1:48:24] no just we're in the
[1:48:29] message is the message in us come on
[1:48:32] Brothers come on musicians we appreciate
[1:48:35] these kids for singing and doing their
[1:48:37] part really appreciate them but it's
[1:48:40] part of the work we're having to work on
[1:48:43] now make a plunt plain plunt we're
[1:48:47] working on getting another Sunday school
[1:48:49] class worked in
[1:48:50] because we got so many kids now until we
[1:48:54] don't have the room we need another
[1:48:57] church with 10 Sunday school rooms
[1:49:00] anybody got the
[1:49:02] money no so we'll make out what we got
[1:49:06] so we're going to have to start moving
[1:49:07] some things
[1:49:09] around and whether you like it or not it
[1:49:11] ain't going to be on basis what you
[1:49:14] like it's going to be on the basis of
[1:49:17] the best thing that we can do I'm known
[1:49:20] for being arrogant and hateful
[1:49:22] somebody's got to do it we were sitting
[1:49:25] out here at the church one day and we
[1:49:26] was talking about how to redo inside in
[1:49:28] here we was all out there eating dinner
[1:49:31] well there was a bunch of Brothers they
[1:49:33] was all sitting out there eating away
[1:49:34] and they were talking about what we was
[1:49:35] going to do and one w't do it this way
[1:49:38] one won't do it that way and you'd be
[1:49:40] surprised what a lot of people can
[1:49:44] want
[1:49:46] right after a while he looked around
[1:49:48] they said where Sam
[1:49:51] Nanny looked at him and said he's
[1:49:53] upstairs said he's doing it his
[1:49:56] way because he's up there doing
[1:50:00] it yes if I'm going to be responsible
[1:50:03] I'm going to stay in
[1:50:05] control like that so if you get your
[1:50:08] feelings hurt put them in the seat in
[1:50:10] you Brites and forget
[1:50:13] it right but we're doing the best we can
[1:50:16] do to try to work we're going to have to
[1:50:20] put a locking key on the downstairs part
[1:50:23] cuz a lot of you bring your food in and
[1:50:25] thing we're going to have to put a class
[1:50:27] within that room to where we eat
[1:50:32] at so then we're going to try to make it
[1:50:34] the best you can if you come in late if
[1:50:38] it's very late you'll find a door
[1:50:41] locked I don't understand that now I
