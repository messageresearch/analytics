you uh how many enjoyed that sermon this morning that we heard i i we were actually talking about when we were up um i'm going to say some things about brother dale even though he's here when we were up at the camp meeting we were just kind of got to talking about how fortunate we are to have a good pastor that's taught us and settled us in the word so that when you go to a tent meeting that you can you know kind of understand what's being what's being preached on so we certainly appreciate brother dale and all the years that he's ministered to us and everything um all right here we go are we good now everybody can hear me yes okay appraisal all right so i wanted to speak uh this afternoon on a little subject from hebrews chapter 11 and then from second corinthians chapter 12 if the brothers could could get set to turn to those chapters and just take a little topic of of empty vessels this afternoon and speak home and uh and and just see what the lord has for us let's go to the lord in prayer before we go to reading of the word lord god we thank you so much lord for the privilege to be able to gather together among your people lord we're so privileged to be able to know people that believe the same thing that we do lord and be able to gather together and fellowship with them lord and glean little tidbits of knowledge and information from one another and help one another along life's way lord and i believe lord you set things up so that we could lord we need one another we need to fellowship together with one another lord and all together under the leadership of the holy ghost lord jesus we come lord god i i believe lord maybe maybe this afternoon many have come with full vessels lord maybe with with pride and maybe enmity and bitterness that we build up against one another and maybe all kinds of doctrines that we've held over the years and things that people have piled up in us lord but i pray lord tonight lord you this afternoon lord that maybe we'll empty those things out lord and come with empty vessels that so that you can fill it up lord realizing that there's nothing within ourselves lord jesus that we can that can be of satisfaction to you lord jesus there's no strength within ourselves but all of our strength comes from you lord lord we look to you lord jesus with everything that we have need of lord tonight we pray lord that you'll be satisfied with our offerings of praise and our songs that we sing lord and lord that you'll just feel welcome to move among us this afternoon lord lord that we'll have church this afternoon lord and there won't just be a gathering together of just a vain worship but but of true worship knowing what we believe and in the god that we serve and lord we ask this blessing upon your people lord knowing that you hear and answer prayer and that you'll meet every need in the name of the lord jesus christ i pray amen so hebrews chapter 11 verses 32 to 40 it starts off and it says this and we know we all know hebrews chapter 11 is that that faith chapter that you know even you can't hardly read this without building up your faith and almost getting emotional and when you go and read all of the the things that that people have endured and everything and it starts off in verse 32 it says what more shall i what shall i more say for the time would fail to tell me of gideon and the barack and of samson and of jephthah and of david also and samuel and other prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed value and fight turned to fight the armies of the aliens now now you know brother branham when he after after he got done reading the scripture he said he's talking about god's heroes these are god's heroes and and god wants to make a hero out of you so listen to how god made a hero out of them and that's how he'll make a hero out of you was it through their own effort and through their own might women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sown asunder were tempted were slain with a sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goat skins being destitute afflicted tormented maybe maybe one time a good sermon to be preached what's the cost of being a christian because these people these gods heroes endured a lot and you know every every person that comes to god is going to go through a little testing time little little valleys and things sometimes it's not easy being a christian of whom the world was not worthy because they were god's heroes god's heroes they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise god having provided something better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect right now set that in your mind as we go to second corinthians 12 9 and we'll read this and he said unto me paul's speaking he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore i will rather glory now this seems a very odd statement if you dwell on this and meditate it i will i would rather glory in my infirmities my what a strange thing for somebody to say that they will glory in their weakness i will rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me you may have you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now one thing i maybe call out when we were up there listening listening to the brothers at the tent meeting and everything you know every night the different brothers was preach and and one thing i was talking to zach about this earlier that each night a brother would take a message that brother branham preached and you know of course if you don't read the message or listen to the message it's kind of hard to tell but you know one one night born brother preached on the countdown one night one brother preached on the masterpiece one night one brother preached on the attraction on the mount what is the attraction on the mount and you know those things kind of read true in other words the thing that i'm doing is taking a message is very common if you just know what to listen for so i'm taking a message to a perfect strength uh by perfect weakness and just kind of breaking it down and looking at some of these nuggets that are in here and even in this message when brother brian priests his sermon he talks about what a strange sermon what a strange kind of topic for somebody to take in kind of the pentecostal realm the pentecostal believers that's always talking about the power that we have and then to preach on weakness how how that how that weakness is almost a good thing we talk about in this this last verse in this in this chapter god having provided something better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect ends with the word perfect and we talk about coming to perfection a lot perfect faith a perfect perfect love a perfect from a perfect god a perfect bride we talk about coming to perfection through the stature of a perfect man but really how do we come to perfection we come to perfection it won't be it won't be through our own power or our own might or anything that we can do within ourselves but it'll be a total reliance on god it'll be a total reliance you know even even maybe taking a step back looking as you look at me standing behind this pulpit i'm really there's almost like two two individuals maybe standing up here there's me the person the person and then as brother dale was bringing out this morning there's the office that i'm standing in the office being the the spirit of the living god that can speak through me if if i could get out of the way and that's the problem with every christian every believer if you could get out of the way and let god live brother brother said if we can get out of the way if we could get ourselves out of the way then deity could be expressed if we can get out of the way then god can make himself express so the problem that i have this more this afternoon is if i can get myself out of the way then i can say something profitable to you but if i don't get out of the way then i might be just be preaching for my own bitterness or my own complexes or their own my own things that i think need to be corrected in the church and i might be coming up here just to say something that would not be truly edifying but just to speak something that i within my own mind without my my own reasoning capacity i think would be helpful and it in the end would not be helpful at all but if i can get out of the way and let god speak then then you've got something now brother brahma said in the perfect strength by perfect weakness he said oh god strategy god strategy listen to this is to take empty empty human vessels and shake the world with him now to think about that that he can take a life that's all broken and all messed up and and if you just bring your empty vessel regardless of what your past is regardless of where you've been in life and bring that empty vessel to him then he can fill it up and make something useful out of it then he'll shake the world with it he'll shake your job with it he'll shake the church with the life that now you're demonstrating you'll shake everything with it because now you become one of god's heroes somebody that was maybe before was living a broken tore up life and now god comes and fills you up with something that beyond all of your human effort anything that you can do of yourself and fills you up with the life of god to shake the world and brother brown said that at pentecost what did he do at pentecost he said it took them 10 days 10 days to get all emptied out now imagine them sitting up in that upper room wondering who is going to be the greatest and wondering who wondered who you know remembering who offended somebody and peter i remember what you did you'd betrayed jesus three times and all these kind of things and heaping all that but ten after ten days every day maybe a little bit more emptied out emptied out into it out until finally god was able to come on the scene and do something and if you and i could ever get ourselves emptied out to where we lay aside all of our reasoning and lay aside all of our bitterness and lay aside all of our complexes you'll see god come on the scene and do something you'll see god be able to shake the world with your empty vessel with your poor tore up life see god be able to grab a hold of you and do something with you and jesus brother and said they was all standing there with their vessels turned up with their vessels turned up and god took himself and filled them up that's all they shook the world you see if we could just realize like they did they realized that they were insufficient how could they take a gospel to the world how could they fulfill mark 16 they needed something that they did not have and there's something else that you and i need you and i need brother when he got to the end of this message he was talking about how all the devils had been unleashed at this age all the devil's loosed at the river euphrates all everything coming against the bride and how will you be able to conquer how will you be able to overcome without god on your side without god without god making complete preeminence giving yourself holy over to god so that he has your soul and your spirit and your body and everything under his control now brother brown let me let me let me get on to a come maybe an odds odd way to start this sermon off we're talking about the insufficiency of man the insufficiency of you to do anything the insufficiency of the preacher to do anything of his own self and the way brother branham started this message off was talking about altar calls he said i want to say that and clear so that you'll understand now listen the way that he brings us out this is such a controversial topic he said there never was an altar call made in all the bible there's no such a thing in the scripture nowhere down through the ages was it made to the methodist stage about 200 years ago see altar calls now later on in this message he'll call it an artificial altar call so if there's an artificial altar call there's got to be a true altar call there's an artificial altar call where man gets involved and there's a true altar call where it's god doing the calling and so we don't want an altar call where man gets involved where man is the one saying come up where man is the one saying surrender but when god gets involved and you lay your heart on the altar because not because a man could miss you not because a man told you a good old sob story and maybe told you to go go watch a movie about jesus dying on the cross and it made you cry big old crocodiles crocodile tears but because you heard the word and the word of god caused something on the inside of your heart to respond then you've got a true altar call you you see why you maybe when you miss it listen go back and listen to this message you begin to wonder what does altar call have to do with perfect strength by perfect weakness because you've got to be successful in anything to be a successful christian to be successful message believer you've got to get all of your humanity out of the way you've got to get all of your human involvement out of the way and let god do everything bill brandon said altar calls are when people come up and try to persuade and pull people come on john you know that your mother died praying for you your mother died and you get to cry no big old crocodile crocodile tears come on john that's not conviction friends that's not conviction them kind of very seldom if you ever hear that one goes very far and in that you get everything that's the reason the church is all muddled up the way it is today is because of such things conviction you don't have to say a thing brother you don't have to say a thing of yourself you don't have to tell a big old sob story anything god's there and done done the work wow and he quotes while peter spake these words the holy ghost fell on them and they heard the word in other words what does it what causes a true altar call the preaching of the gospel and when the preaching of the gospel goes what is the preaching of the gospel to realize that jesus paid the price for you that you don't have to work up nothing that he's already done it that he's looking at you now through the blood of the sacrifice that he's not looking at your sins but they're covered by the blood all he hears is you crying up to him saying father forgive me i know i've done wrong and he's not looking at you that's what the gospel message is and that's what will bring conviction not somebody cry making somebody tell somebody a stop stop or anything he said see there's no altar call see no such a thing a real altar call a real altar call is god doing the calling god doing the calling and brother goes on to quote what he said because jesus listen jesus said no man could come to me except my father draws him first and all that the father has given me will come to me that's right that throws your altar call completely out altogether see our responsibility has preached the word the bible said as many as believed was baptized now what's really strange though is at the end of this sermon brother branham makes a true altar call a true altar call where the word being preached causes a reaction to the people and they begin to lay their lives down they begin to call upon the name of the lord they begin to give their hearts over to god because you see a true altar call is god doing the work a true anything is when god actually does the thing when man gets himself in the way when man can get himself in the way it just messes everything up we fail to realize we fail to realize that god wants us he wants us to come empty so he can use us he wants us to come empty now brother adam told this story he's told this story about how he he said mama charlie cox up there in kentucky that uh uh she she began to hand out tracks and she got some a little sister to start coming to the church there and when brother branham went to preach there in kentucky that the little sister wanted to talk to him now listen listen good to this story we're talking about weakness and he said i went into a home just a little before that i was standing on the outside and the lady said i'd like to speak to that minister and i went into their little home and she said your brother branham and i said yes ma'am and she said i am so ashamed of the looks of my house and she said to ask you in she started weeping she said but i have such a need and i got real confidence in you now here's a little sister that's living in maybe a little ramshackle shack on the side of the road now we we've been monica's brother lives right across the street from the house that uh mama cox was in and we every time we go up there to visit we look at that house and and that house as a little almost run down little house where brother brown used to stay at that house and this house he's talking about another little sister that lives in such a humble little place and she said i'm embarrassed for you to come into my house i'm embarrassed now now you think about maybe you let's put it personal to you you and your ramshackle house with all of your your torah back life all of the stuff that you've been maybe involved with who knows what your story is and maybe you're ashamed to have jesus christ come into your house like this woman was because the way brother branham explained it was she did not realize that god wants you to be weak he wants you to be weak and realize that you need him and we get all built up we want to be somebody she thought that that brother brandon would feel more at home and maybe a mansion like donald trump has with gold leaf bathrooms and all that stuff all over are decorated but god wants humility and meekness and he just he said i looked around in this home a little home a little home about like i was raised in but the wall full of pictures of christ he stepped in and all around that home was decorated with pictures of christ he said there laid a bible on the table i said i never any more honor in my life i never any more honor in my life this is the kind of home i like to walk into a home that looked poor on the outside now your your house on the outside you might have knee problems you might have back problems you might have all kinds of things but god god does not care he wants you to be weak so that you trust in him because you will not overcome by your own efforts or by your own your own abilities he said she asked a request for someone five hours from the time that we prayed together this little grandmother and i prayed together god had answered god answered the prayer of that little sister down in her old ramshackle house in the middle of kentucky back where probably no great man had been the president never went there but a little prophet came and entered in that home and felt welcome there he said we try to make our weaknesses excuses now if you could get this we try to make our weaknesses excuses he said we want to tell how big we are how great we are i think that's one of the things that god gave me the text for this is brother brethren saying this was to get that out of our mind get it out of your mind that you're supposed to be a big shot get it out of your mind that you're supposed to be a big shot message preacher that you're supposed to be an evangelist on the field all the time get it out of your mind that you're supposed to have a big position in church get it out of your mind that you're supposed to be real important get it out of your mind because god wants to see somebody that's weak and humble that he can work through that ain't got nothing no ability to their name they can't do nothing of their own self they're completely relying on him [Applause] brother braham said there's so many of us likes to testify or likes to think that we're insufficient and therefore we make that an excuse we'll make it an excuse we'll say i don't have any education i ain't got no education where that's exactly where god wants you to be so that you'll rely on him you'll say i ain't got no ability i can't do it on myself and that's exactly where god wants you to be how how can you how can you get rid of all those problems how can you get rid of that pride on your own how can you get rid of that bitterness but if you rely on god he'll get rid of it he's the one you'll say i'm unable to do this and brother i said if you keep that up and do that in that way keep going that like that then you can't mount to anything you'll never amount to nothing if you keep looking at your excuse and your weakness as an excuse you'll never amount to anything but the very thing that we make excuses by our weaknesses god uses that very thing to tackle the job with do you realize that your weaknesses is what god wants to see he doesn't want to see a strong church somebody that can't be taught somebody they can't be reasoned with come in with your big old intellect and everything sit down on the pew and say i'm not accepting none of that but he wants to see somebody come in with an empty vessel pour it out with you don't have no pride you'll understand of yourself you're ready to receive somebody say i need god because i'm weak in myself how can i heal myself how can i save myself i need jesus christ brother of america said we must come to find our weaknesses find our black bad places and see how little we are and put our trust in somebody that's strong this afternoon are you ready to put your trust in somebody that's strong maybe all this time you've been putting your trust trying to put yourself make yourself strong and trying to put your trust in your own self now it's time to come with an empty vessel and lay down all those ideas and cut put your put your trust wholly in in one that's strong one that can one that can meet every need one that can satisfy every empty place brother brown said that's the reason that's the reason why he chooses us because we're in that condition and he said we find out that those people who are the weakest and the rejected by the outside world is what is god's heroes god's heroes so don't ever don't ever try to be great don't ever try to work up something within yourself i'm reading these are these are brother brown's words practically this whole sermon is brother brown's words don't ever try to be great don't ever try to work up something within yourself to try to work up something so that you can show your great ability don't ever try to be strong within yourself because god wants to use somebody that is weak so somebody brother brown says so somebody came up to him and he said they said to me long ago said brother branham said we just received the holy ghost shall we now seek for gifts for our ministry now listen to the way he lays this out what should i seek for gifts for the ministry now what would a gift do to a little baby christian a gift what what purpose would a gift a gift would help maybe a little bit but a gift before long it would begin to puff up somebody in their head a lot you know one of the chiefest gifts that a lot of people want is they want discernment it seems like in my christian walk i've run across so many people i i just there would be reams of pages of a people that i met before that say they have some level of discernment now let's think about that for a second what would discernment do for you let's say that you were able to talk to somebody and all of a sudden you realize that they had adultery in their life or they had they were living in fornication or whatever now what you going to do with it what you going to do with that information now you got the goods on somebody what you going to do with that something a little baby little baby christian i'll tell you what they do they go on facebook and make a lot of vague posts about it okay but when i ran across somebody i can't believe that so-and-so would you know make a vague because what what would you do with that information if all it does is puff up your head and make you think that you're a big shot then why would you want a gift but gifts i believe that god reserves gifts for adults god reserves a gift for mature christians that will know what to do with it that won't pit or pattern around with it and it won't puff up their head but they'll they'll be mature enough to know what to do with it maybe maybe if god gives you a gift maybe if you got a true gift a mature christian you won't go running around telling everybody about it bragging about it maybe it's something that maybe only between you and god that you know of him or and maybe the pastor maybe just a few people but maybe god is withholding that from you maybe god is waiting to unleash that gift in your life because he knows that you won't do the right thing with it now listen what brother brown says about it he said i said i said don't do it let it alone don't seek for gifts and he turned and looked at me said i just read a certain brothers book that told us after we received the holy ghost we should seek gifts for these to use this holy ghost i said and become a stuffed shirt see and become a stuffed shirt right and what is this stuff shirt a stuffed shirt is a smug conceited and usually pompous person a person who behaves in a very formal way and expects expects to be treated as somebody important i'm important my do you do you realize if a little baby had discernment my goodness i got the goods on you i i know all the uh maybe it will be able to list all your faults out but what good would that do what good would that do what good would it be able to talk to little young people and whatever and and say well i know all you're false i don't want to know everybody's faults i want to i want to see you saved i want to see you delivered i don't want to have a big old list that i can parade in front of you you know you see becoming a stuffed shirt is the exact opposite of what god wants us to be what we would say i'm the one i'm the one that would should sit on the platform with all the ministers i'm going to parade myself up there and sit on the platform whatever so that everybody can see me i'm the one that should sing the songs you see what happens when god gives you a gift maybe you've got a gift of singing and before long if you're not careful you begin to think that i'm the one that should always be singing the songs i'm the one that can bring down the presence of the lord i'm the one that can do it right and then before long you i've got a big old stuffed shirt i'm the one that should have first place is what what you begin to think i'm the one i'm the one you've got to regard me you've got to pay attention to me and that's the exact opposite of what brother now listen listen these are not my word i'm just i'm just saying what brother branham said you would be surprised how it causes a reaction when you just say what brother branham said i'm just saying what brother graham said if you want to get mad at anybody for saying these things get up brother branham he said i said don't sing nothing god's got anything for you he'll give it to you and just let him take care of that just let him take care of that because it would be better it would be better to walk in weakness and humility than to be a stuffed shirt with a gift it was better to be a nobody it would be a better better it would be better to be a a doormat where everybody in the church could walk by like brother brown mentioned an influence and the message influence and just scrape the bottom of their boot off of you and wipe their boot off for you it would be better to be like that than to be a stuffed shirt with a gift it would be better to be a nobody in the church i i want to be i want to live in weakness listen if you can get to the place of ministers where you don't care if you never preach another sermon as long as god can have the preeminence in you i i i don't care about being a great man i don't want to be a great man i want god to be able to do something in my life instead of trying to be great we ought to be trying to find out how little we can get brother brahma said see then god can use us he said when you are big you know when you are big god can't use you but when you are little god can work psalm 24 7 says some trusting chariots and summon horses but we will remember the name of the lord our god some put all that trust in what what you can do with your big old chariot or your big your big car or whatever whatever it is and second corinthians says such trust have we through christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god second corinthians 4 7 but we have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god maybe of god and not of us you see brother brahma said when they feel like they can't they haven't got nothing that's when god can take a hold of him and do something with him but when we are thinking that we're able to do it then god can't use us because we're wanting to do it ourselves so if you can get it out of your head that you can do it yourself then god can begin to work god wants you to recognize your insufficiency so that you'll put all of your trust on him all of your trust on him and not on yourself but then he said on the other side we get these feelings and then we think that we're insufficient and we don't want to do it but then if we just listen to the call of god that's the very thing that god wants us to get into that kind of a shape so he can now am i to think about that that we think that god wants us to come out all bold and everything which boldness comes from the spirit of god you see but when you come out thinking that god wants you to be in a place of insufficiency god wants you to feel like many times god god wants weak preachers that's a weird really strict strange thing to say god wants weak weak young people god wants weak old people he wants you to realize that you can't do it in your own self and to rely completely on him he said so long as we're trying in ourselves and depending on our abilities and so forth why we'll do nothing but when we get to a place where we know we're nothing then god can use us god wants to pour the backwards the outcasts the broken vessels and he said there's one thing that we've got to master there's one thing that we've got to master if we expect to fulfill god's desire in our life and that is we have to master the thought of human ability the thought that i can't do it the thought cause you can't do it but when you think that you can then you won't you won't be able to he said if we ever get to a spot where we think that we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of that thing and lay it aside so that god can use us he said we cannot use one ability we've got to make a complete surrender and to come to god you've got to surrender to him both soul body and spirit everything that you are has to be surrendered to god in order that he can work his will in you and me in order that he can work now see then he goes on to talk about how you can't you can't get strength you can't get strength from your own self and you can't that also means that you can't get strength from any man you can only get strength from god you cannot you and that's our problem we so many so often start looking at one another as our example but if we'll keep our eyes solely on god because you don't get your strength you don't get your strength from yourself you don't get your strength from anybody else and he quote john chapter 5 verse 41 to 45 he said i receive not honor from men but i know you that you have not the love of god in you i am come in my father's name and you receive me not if and another shall come in his own name him you will receive how can you believe which receive honor one of another and seek not the honor that cometh from god only and brother branham's explanation when she preached this sermon was how are you gonna have faith if you're trying to get strength from somebody else's relationship with god you can't even get strength from your own from your own doings from your own ability how are you going to get strength from looking at another man keep your eye solely on god when he said when we are expecting saying this guy he's a great person this is a great person i'll just lean upon him i'll just lean upon him he said that displeases god when you do that we must lean upon god and god alone we mustn't trust the ability of ourselves or any man we must completely yield to god and that's why in jeremiah chapter 17. now this is a this is a powerful scripture to quote jeremiah 17 says cursed be the man that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departeth from the lord and do you see you see the danger in that as soon as you begin to trust in somebody like look at all these people that left the message as soon as they their congregation doesn't know which way to turn because they they begin to trust in somebody instead of putting all of their getting all of their strength from god alone he said no ability i don't care whose it is will never be usable in the sight of god i don't care who that is god has to get all of our abilities out of us before he can achieve his purpose if he's got something for us to do and as long as we feel that we're doing a pretty good job of it then we'll never be able to use to be used of god see what god is looking for he's looking he's looking for little rejects he's looking for those broken vessels that he can grab up out of the out of the pile the ash heap and put back into purpose for himself he's looking for shattered lives like like rahab now you think about rahab sitting on that wall and in her life she had gotten herself into that miserable situation where to make money she had to sell herself she had to sell her body and there she was on that wall and here come the messenger the ministers to pay her a visit and that was exactly the kind of person that god was looking for because she was all she was broken up she was her life her backstory was just miserable she had a shattered life at least brother branham would put it she was the off scourer of the earth and that's what god is looking for he's looking for the off scour of the earth he's looking for somebody that can't say they're save their self and knows it the woman of samaria the woman at the well who had five husbands and and the one she had then when jesus was talking to her she she wasn't living too with an and she wasn't married to and you know the samaritans the jews couldn't even talk to them they were they were treated like dogs they were treated like they would they would skirt around some area but that was exactly the kind of person that jesus wanted to find he wanted to find somebody that could not help themselves a little woman like ruth that that maybe a lot of the jews wouldn't even talk to from moab from moab with all think about that horrible backstory of where moab even started from from lot and his daughters maybe they what a testimony to think about the the heritage that the the the people of moab had from but that that's exactly the kind of people that god is looking for unpopular somebody that doesn't fit in somebody that doesn't fit in with school with maybe maybe you're not interested in sports and all the popular stuff that they're doing at school but that's exactly the kind of person that god is looking for people with problems people with issues somebody with a lot a whole a whole laundry list of issues that that somebody's got to deal with and you can't deal with him yourself but god can god can take those issues and do something with he can take that broken empty vessel patch it back together and fill it up and do something useful with it see brother brown said history proves that god always chooses the nobodies to to become his somebodies he always chooses the nobodies to become his somebodies god takes the person he takes the person that's nothing now that should build all of our faith up right let's see there's nobody in here that's beyond the reach of god because he wants somebody that's nothing he wants somebody that's broken on the ash heap of despair on the ash heap of life and brother said that he said here's something to console us here's something that encourages out of weakness and humility god chooses the people to build his kingdom out of if we ever get to heaven if we ever stand in the presence of god with his church we'll stand and a bunch of people that's been weak and rejected and cast out by the world and know what nothing's you'll stand amongst all of those people that were listed out in the chronicles of hebrews 11 all the ones that through fire and through torture and all of that overcame not through their own power but through their own weakness trusting in one who had the strength through through their own denying their own ability my my you think about what how glorious heaven is going to be to be amongst people that did not come out of maybe king's palaces but came out of the the side of the road that's pulled up off the side of the rejects the world's rejects brother brown said that's god's opportunity that's god's way of getting to us is when we're weak we get something then this encourages us encourages of course because god's whole kingdom is built out of these kind of people his whole kingdom is built out of rejects his whole kingdom was built out of people that don't know hardly how to read their bible after like like a certain minister what we know of that they couldn't even read his bible and said god help me to read my bible and god opened up his eyes so he could read so he could read the bible rejects that don't even know how to read rejects like peter and all the disciples listen i'm preaching to you an encouraging message this afternoon i'm preaching to you there's hope it don't matter what where you are in your life he said remember it's the off scours that god always picks up the nobodies then he makes them somebodies for him he said may not know it in this life but it will be in the one that's coming that my you think after this life's over after all the heartaches and trials and everything we're going to something more glorious than you could ever comprehend and it'll be a place where all the rejects and the nobodies and know-nothings are gathered together where god made somebody that ain't nothing somebody he took somebody off the side of the road and put him and made him apprentice with god he said if you're nothing you're something to god if you're a nobody you're somebody to god all right but now listen listen now the devil the devil wants to get you and that's where he wants to get you the devil wants to get you to make you think that you're already full to make you think that well i'm in a i'm in a good state right now i i i'm in a good now listen to how brother brown says he said he made this statement if the devil can't get you on this side he'll put you off to that side and we got to have a balance what are the two sides how much you know and how much you sense how much you know and how much you feel he said some of us build it upon intellectual conception oh that this know-it-all this man's a trained scholar we should train our people and school them in other words look how much i know look how much understanding that i have and now i'm so built up within myself and then you become arrogant and you get real prideful now look let's look on the other side of the fence the next one bases it upon some sensation of movement shaking crying shouting dancing in the spirit or something some emotional outward work and he said that's just as bad as the education both of them are just as bad on the one side it's just as bad to have your head full to know all these things not not bad to know we want to know we want to know the truth but what's bad is when you begin building up an arrogant complex when you begin thinking that thinking that you're somebody because of something or on the other side when you go maybe to a camp meeting and you run through the congregation and and the spirit falls because you preached or something and then you begin to say well look how spiritual i am look look how spiritual i am when i preach all these young people come to the altar when i preach the spirit of god falls and now behold behold the workmanship of my ability i'm a great man i'm a great preacher or whatever whatever it might be i'm more spiritual than somebody else and you begin to get further and further away from god on either way that you look at and that's the devil the devil trying to convince you that you're already full that you don't need nothing else but what i want to convince you of this afternoon is if you come with empty vessels god will fill you up he'll fill you up to where you get rid of all that pride and all the arrogance and you're able to fellowship with other people you're able to get around other people because the pride and the arrogance has gone he said but the thing of it is the thing of it is having nothing that you can depend on in your own self or anything that you can do just a complete total surrender of your weaknesses unto god and say here i am here i am having nothing no ability that you can trust in no ability that you can trust in he said some people some people as soon as they become christians they become arrogant indifferent and different that's right when they're just taking a vice versa of the path arrogant is when is when you you begin to get lifted up within yourself and and you don't want to fellowship with people you don't want to talk you start looking down at people you start doing like we'll get to it in a second like paul before he was converted he was squashing the wrong thing he wanted to smash the weak he wanted to smash the weak people smashed the wrong thing so when you get er brother said get small stay humble keep your eyes on god just keep your eyes right on god and stay as small as you can now paul brother was using paul as an example there in first corinthians chapter two verse one he said this man this man paul was trained this man was trained he could speak he said he could speak near pretty near any language there was in the world he had to brag about it he was brought up under the strict sect of the pharisees and his father was a pharisees later he was a pharisee of the fair season that means that he was absolutely the strictest of the pharisees he was a great fellow he was he was he was good he was he was great and he had authority and he was smart his father had given him an education under the best teacher there was in all the land abundantly the best teacher that there was gamaliel at that time the most notable teacher of any of the schools so he had been taught really well he knew in other words he knew the doctrine paul became become that type of a man he learned every language he learned psychology he learned all the different things that there he is in to be learned that way and he said now brother brown said this he said listen to this same man with all this education after he had received christ listen to what he said how strong and great he was he had to forget it he had to realize that he could not depend upon himself he could not depend upon all that learning that he had to correctly interpret the word he could not depend upon all that gamaliel had taught to correctly identify the the risen christ he had to realize that he could not depend upon himself he had to realize that his education was nothing all of that background all the fact that he had learned all those languages all that he had to deny and now listen in first corinthians chapter two verse one to five how paul approached the corinthian church paul approached him like this and he said and i brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom in other words not with my own ability that i got from gamaliel in other words he's coming with a revelation directly from jesus christ for that age he's coming with a predestinated word for that day not because he got a lot of education not because he got he got it all a good schooling declaring unto you the testimony of god for i determine not to know anything among you look how weirdly this is worded for i determine not to know anything among you saved jesus christ and him crucified he's speaking to a group of people that say he's looking at them with all their problems and all their weaknesses and all their failings and all of their background that many of them came out of the gentiles and many of them came out out of rough backgrounds and stuff but he's saying that don't matter to me i want to see nothing in you i don't want to see your background i don't want to see all your intellect or your ability i don't want to see nothing but jesus christ in you hey listen i believe that's what brother dale's been trying to get into this all these years as he's trying to get all of our own ability baked out of us he's trying to get our own self baked out so that nothing is left but jesus christ so that we're not relying on our own selves to preach the gospel so that we're not relying on our own ability to live the gospel but nothing he said i'm determined to know nothing about your abilities right i know that this is brother brown i'm explaining this scripture i know that there's nothing in you and i'm only determined that i know that there's nothing in you i know that there's nothing in you nothing good of in you and i'm only determined to know one thing that i see in you that's jesus christ and him crucified the crucified savior among you that's all i'm going to recognize all i'm going to recognize as jesus christ in you not your abilities not your own strengths and he said he said and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom not with a lot of good intellectual teaching that came from gamalie or from the schooling from the from the the the what he had got growing up but in the demonstration of the spirit and power the demonstration of the spirit of god actually quickening the word and making it live that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god now look the reason brother branham said that he was fearing that he said i'm come to you in fear he said the reason he was fearing not because he was scared of anything but he was scared that he would displease god in some way that he'd get his own ability mixed up into it something that he learned oh imagine him coming to the corinthians and thinking my what if i get something that gamaliel taught me that was off the word mixed up in here and they were looking at that instead of the true power of the gospel what if i get something something even within my own self mixed up in here but i i listen to get to get uh people ready so that there's nothing in them but god it takes a pure unadulterated word without any any kind of man's involvement that where i started off in this message with the altar call will get messed up when man messes with it anything will get any move will get messed up when man begins to inject their own ideas and you see that's what paul was afraid of he came to them with fear afraid that he would get his own self in the way inject his own ideas and his own complexes and maybe throw in a little a little bitter jab at a roman soldier or something that had done something wrong to him it's got to come you are what you eat and the pure word if we preach only christ in him crucified we will become only christ and him crucified amen he said i come to you in fear that i would come that way but i come to you knowing nothing but christ and him crucified what that means what that means is that no psychology no psychology being preached no church gossip no parables from the world no no movie references just the word of god only no preaching about his own weakness in other words not preaching from his own bitterness or ready to come and attack somebody no bitterness from things people say no messages rooted in his own complexes his own failings wondering if people's listening to him if we can just get out and get all that stuff out of the way then god believe god can do something no no revenge messages no revenge messages of coming up to attack somebody because they didn't like something because paul said i determined i determined not to know anything among you nothing among you saved jesus christ and him crucified that was his objective is to see nothing in the people of the corinthians except jesus christ and him and him crucified and brother ram said listen to this man listen to this man who was a warrior who had stripped himself if there's anything that our schools needs today if it's anything our churches needs today it's a stripping of themselves of your own thoughts and your own abilities strip yourselves before god unless you would try to do something within yourselves he said you've got to become nothing not a know-it-all not a great somebody but a nobody you got to come dust you've got to get to a place that you know that you're nothing i don't never rise above it now listen for as soon as you rise above it as soon as you rise above it you rise above god as soon as you begin to think that you have some special importance or you have some special ability within yourself you're rising above god he said you've got to keep yourself in the dust and on the road to damascus you've got to keep yourself off your high horses when i when i get everything out of me brother brown said then god can come in but as long as i got some of myself there then god can't get in and he said now now let's dwell on paul a little bit more he said this great fellow paul he was a prince among the preachers he was respected by every denomination that man could have went to a city and had a meeting anywhere because why because he had credentials now see it matters where you got your credentials from he had credentials from from his learning and from his background and from his education from his own ability but the credentials that come from a christian come from god come from the power of the holy ghost he said he was so great and so determined to smash out all the people that was weak smash out the weak smashing out the weak see see you've got to be so careful who you smash but paul was smashing the ones that that god wanted to work through he was smashing the ones that were weak now these are brother brown's words that he smashed the weak smashing the weak because they have a background of sin we don't smash people because they got a background because they got a torah background we don't smash people because they maybe they don't believe like we do we don't smash people because they somebody struggles with theology and they're having a hard time but you see that's that's who god works through somebody that can barely understand somebody who's having troubles he said he was binding the christians but notice him he had to become bound himself so he could lose it he could lose his strength and authority and then we go on to moses brother i said we know he was strong and well trained and and he said seeing the need of the day moses with his intellectual powers and his ability that he had to do it with he was a smart man he was the coming pharaoh he had psychology he had power he had physical strength he had everything so he said i'm well equipped i know all of it and if there's a man in the land that's able to do what i am if there's somebody that's able to do it i am and brother brahma said he couldn't use it then neither can he now god cannot use our natural abilities he said i can quote that bible with my eyes closed and god can't use a bit of that if somebody were to say that that i can quote that bible with my eyes closed god can't use a bit of that but he said one thing that moses had going for him was he recognized when he was licked he recognized when he come to a place and that's what that's what that's what the back side of the desert your backside of the desert experiences for is to get you to a place to realize that there's no inability in yourself that you can't do it of your own self to realize that that you can't do it to realize that you're weak and and in this sermon brother branham outlined the six weaknesses that moses had and he said he said he said moses came to god and he said lord i ain't no good now how many of us have said that before i ain't no good see that's when god is getting you to a place to realize that that you can't do it on your own lord i ain't no good i ain't no good of my own self and he said i can't speak i can't speak i can't talk right there's something i i don't have any kind of ability within myself how am i supposed to speak and and then he'd go back to his background well i slew an egyptian i killed somebody i don't think there's anybody in here that's got a backstory that bad i killed somebody and you see none of that none of that mattered to god because god was able to take that and patch it all up fix it up and put god and put moses into service sure he had killed somebody and moses said i i can't go back i can't go back to where i came from that's the same story that the little woman that came in and and washed jesus feet with her tears said when she broke that glass of ointment there was no going back for a refund at that point there's no going back there's no going back only going forward he said i can't go back they won't receive me they won't receive me with my message how many times how many times has ministers thought that maybe in your private hours they i might i might start preaching and nobody will nobody will want to hear me it falls on deaf ears nobody will receive me but that's the weakness that god wants to work through weakness where you can't do it of your own self he said and he said i got no message in other words i don't know what to say how am i supposed to know what to say how are you supposed to know what to say because we got a prophet that came and told us what the true interpretation of the word is he told us he told he said everything he gave us a message of what the true what god we should serve that there's one god he gave us the understanding of how to be baptized and how to live a good christian life and and how there's no ability within your own self which is what i'm preaching tonight and you say i got no message but god is able to give you one god is able to give you the truth the true understanding and see brother i said to see how he was he was nothing he was nothing he had been a brother he had been cured you realize that's what your backside of the desert experience is for when you feel like everybody's hating on you and and everybody's just using you at church maybe nobody's giving nobody's putting you on a pedestal nobody's giving you maybe the time of day maybe nobody's shaking your hand the way that you think that and you're going through a back side of the desert experience to get good and cured just like moses was you're that man that's when god is really doing something when you're going through that curing process and you come out and you realize that maybe you ain't as big as you thought you were and then that's right when god can get a hold of you and do something do something in your life he said yeah god could use him then after he was cured he said did god feel sorry for moses with all of his weaknesses say poor little poor little moses something sure has happened to you you fell from your degree he said no no he was a little bit upset with him and he said brother brahma said don't expect pity from god when you've come through your wilderness experience and maybe had everybody been treating you wrong and he said don't expect pity after going through your backside of the desert experience god because then right then is when god can do something amen right moses getting cured up god could use it and then jacob jacob wrestling he come to you know how many times brother branham would use jacob as a as a type of somebody that was born again and then coming to their place in their life coming at that place crossing over ready to meet esau realizing that they needed something else and you see jacob who had the birthright come to a place he was walking on brother brown was using this as an example he said he come to that place where all of his family he sent all of his family on and there he was all alone at the crossing over place ready to go over to meet esau and esau and then he began to be afraid of death he began to be afraid that he was going to die and he began to realize that he needed something else and he began to empty out and that's when he had their experience wrestling with the angel i i i maybe would just want to get it get across to you pay attention to how brother branham explained the experience wrestling with the angel it's so different maybe than a lot of times we think about it he said oh god let the church get like that get to the church to a place where it can't hold on any longer with its natural abilities but has to give over to god now see who was jacob really wrestling with he's he's wrestling with the angel he's wrestling to get rid of his own abilities when he comes to the place where he knows that he can't do it of it on his own self then he just gives it over to god and he conquers he's able to overcome able to overcome by just giving in and letting god take over a lot of times we see we wrestle we wrestle within ourselves because we think that there's some innate ability within ourselves to overcome some ability within ourselves to get rid of the vaping or to get rid of the cigarette smoking or to get rid of the pot smoking or to get rid of the drinking or to get rid of whatever it is as you move up the statue of a perfect man to get rid of all those things and to see the devil leaving you to see the devil getting away from you there's no ina ability in you at all there's nothing within yourself at all it all comes from god if you can just give in and let god take over you see that's many times that's our problem with our kids as we think that somehow we can say the right thing to our family or the right thing to our kids but if you'll just give it over to god like moses mama did when she put him in the bull rushing just turn him loose and say god you take over you take over while he's going through the crocodiles and passed all the hippos and everything you take over then watch god actually perform a miracle watch god do something i i so appreciated brother luis's testimony the other night by about his prayer because i i have i've seen that as well in my own life listen if you put something before god in prayer and and just say i can't do it i can't do it anymore you're gonna have to do something you watch and see if god will not come by whether you lost your keys or your wallet or you lost your kids or you lost your loved ones or your parents or whatever it is watch watch and see if god won't come on the scene why because it's you're surrendering your own ability you're coming to a place where i know that i can't do it and i got to rely on somebody that's got strength see brother brown said it was then that jacob become a prince of god the bible said he'd become a prince and his name was changed and he was a strong man on this side intellectually powerful but on the other side on the other side he was a limping prince weak and wore down but add power before god my that's a paradox now right to think of a man you talk you're talking about coming to adoption and coming to hear your hem conditions and coming to a place where god can use you but what what would that look like what would it look like on the outside what it looked like jesus on the cross dying coming to a place where he had given everything over what it looked like peter who was cross crucified upside down when it looked like somebody that had given their whole life over brother branham who everybody had left him and left him deserted preaching in a little mobile home nobody listening to him it seemed like anymore until he died killed by a drunk driver and it looked like he had died in weakness but he died in power his life was lived under the strength and the power of the gospel many times you see god is looking for a weak vessel a weak empty vessel that he can work through somebody that will yield themselves to him he said let the angel get a hold of you one time the angel of the lord that'll bring you the truth of the message let him get a hold of you one time you'll humble right down to the baptism in jesus name you'll humble right down to all the rest of it if you'll just give it over to give it over to god and let god move and do through you as he will and david david the poorest excuse there was on the field to go father to favor david the the eighth child after after all those seven church age after all the the church ages had gone through and finally there's a little one that everybody had neglected somebody a little smaller group of people that is willing to fulfill the word of god that everybody had overlooked that david's own dad had overlooked that even the prophet the prophet had overlooked the prophet came to anoint him and he's like uh well you know what i i don't know what to do it didn't seem like any any of the ones that would be acceptable of god were present there all the big ones all the strong ones but god selected the weakest the weakest out of all of them and i'm kind of i'm kind of hurrying through my notes here but and david came david came to goliath brother brown said with a raisin pie in his hand for his brother a little raisin pie in his hand and he didn't come with a sword and he had no had no use for the for the all the armor that saul had but he came well he picked up the weakest weakest most miserable looking weapon that you could find on the battlefield a little sling that he could twirl around and instead of picking up a like a trebuchet or a catapult or something he picked up little five little stones listen that's all you need to overcome you don't need any of your own abilities you don't need any of your own strength all you have to have is f-a-i-t-h and j-e-s-u-s and you can overcome everything every goliath that the devil throws at you in your life he said all he wanted he said i got my trust in god and here i go that's it and the giant went down the giant went down with the weakest the weakest out of all his brethren the weakest out of all of israel with the weakest weapon that he could possibly have chosen with no armor on because all he had he put everything every ability was was just thrown on god he stripped himself before god he had stripped himself and called himself unworthy willing realizing that he had no ability to himself brother bryan said we need a david untrained in the theological schools we need a man who knows nothing about that some little plow boy or something some little guy with his stooped shoulders not much to look at will come walking down the road with the power of god you see we've got victory through weakness we've got victory through weak weakness paul paul sitting there in a jail cell with with 39 stripes across his back with he brother brown said with tears scalding his eyes until he couldn't see no more he couldn't see with his natural eye but he could see a crown of righteousness laid up beyond her brother brown said his ankles were wore out and fell off so much from the all the molded bread they throw it in the air his weak he just got weak from all the molded bread and he couldn't hardly hold himself up and the rats were running all over him and spiders and things but he was looking at that crown of righteousness that's why first corinthians chapter 15 says the old death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory when death come at him when death was right there at the door he was not looking at his own abilities but he was looking at a prize that was laid up for him and elisha elijah after he had combed through brother ramsay combed through all the people until preaching that hard message until there was hardly anybody left to listen to him anymore they didn't want to sit and listen to that hard message being preached comb through until until there was just nobody left how he calmed them and they all just kept falling away till there was nobody and then when he got weak didn't become strong that's when brother brown said he gave him a new message he gave him a new message when he got weak when he got to the point he said now now you go tell the tell the king he said go down there and tell that hypocrite thus saith the lord they'll not even be do fall from heaven till i call for it when he became weak when he realized that when it within his own self there was no ability then he then god gave took him up on the mountaintop to show him something and then i'll be closing in just a second now now how about how about that widow with a handful of meal there in second kings chapter four when she got to her weakness she had you see she had a debt to pay off and she couldn't pay that debt off and they were going to come take her two sons away and elisha now brother branham in this sermon he says elijah but it was elisha in the bible elisha that was that was coming to this little widow woman and he said she she got to her weakness she she'd probably starved herself to death she had no meal and a lot of elijah said you've got what have you got in your house just a little oil and a vessel just a little oil and he said go to your neighbors and borrow plenty of them get all the empty vessels that you can bring all the empty vessels and then you're going to see god do something when you bring all the empty vessels he said they're look getting ready before it even happens get ready david heard that sound in the morbid but she was getting ready she was going around bringing me your empty vessels because the prophet of god told me that i'll bring my empty vessels then something's gonna happen and she began to go get ready if you'll get ready then get ready how do you get ready by emptying yourself out get ready before you come to church if you'll get rid of it before you take communion get rid of all that pride go pray up before god and get every get ready because god then you'll see god do something for you he said elijah saw a cloud just the size of a hand if god could only get some empty vessels that's right he said fill the house full of them fill the house full of them see what god wants god's got to have empty vessels there's only one thing left to do turn to god and his word and if you'll do that get some empty vessels take out all the methodists out of them all the pentecostal out of them all the baptists out of them and and just let them be vessels and set them up in the house in other words if you can get rid of all your ideas about how things should be all your pride all of your enmity just get rid of everything and just lay it before god lay whatever the situation is before god and say i'm coming empty i'm coming and i believe the prophet told me that just like that little widow woman the prophet told me if i would get my vessel and just empty out myself that you'll fill it up he said god send us a prophet that will take the word of god that will not take something else but just get empty vessels if god can just get empty vessels and then take the word of god and pour it into the person not some say oh i shook when i received that i spoke in tongues when i received it i danced in the spirit forget it just stay there until it comes that's all till the vessel's full that's it that's the way you do it yes sir the simplicity of it the vessels was filled up why because she did what the prophet told her to do she brought those empty vessels and and just abated he said he said if you can come if you can come just based on one word of god just based on nothing now listen to how simple this is just just with nothing else no other understanding we think a lot of times you've got to come with you can't get nothing until you understand daniel 70 weeks and the seven seals but brother branham said i can just take one little scripture acts 2 38 and that's all we need just obey that repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall be filled up with the oil and you shall be filled and listen to the way he explained that you add to that drop another drop and it keeps dropping in drop drop drop until you get full full that's all you need to come and then you just keep adding to that add and add little drops one drop at a time and he said that's the drop that peter used on the day of pentecost that's the drop that paul used that's the drop that all the disciples used the rest of it will be added you just take that drop and follow that true and the rest of it will be all right get weak get empty come with an empty vessel come ready to receive come ready to receive those drops straight from the word of god and god will fill you up with his word god will feel and you see she that little widow woman she had gathered all those empty vessels from all of her neighbors and she come and she heard the word of elisha that said now bring them here bring them here the musicians can come bring them here bring your empty vessels and god will fill it up you don't have to go to seminaries you don't have to be smart only thing you have to do is recognize that you know nothing let god let god get a hold of you and he'll take care of the rest of you if you if you can get just get empty you believe that this afternoon let's just worship the lord i want to empty myself out so that god can feel me i want to empty myself out of everything that is everything that is displeasing to god
