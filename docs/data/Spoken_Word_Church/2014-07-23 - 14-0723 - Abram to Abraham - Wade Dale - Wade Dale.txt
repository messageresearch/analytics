your f tonight let him know it holy holy holy holy holy I want to see my own now amen amen good to be the house of the Lord good to see each and every one of you again Amen in the middle of the week amen hope you've had a blessed part of the week and a really good end of the week so I we don't have a lot of announcements just remember U June and I be going into to Oklahoma during the Labor Day weekend to be brother Claud and sister junor for a few days so keep us in your prayers also remember the four families of the loved ones that were were lost I don't know if some of you knew it or not but that plane crash in Arizona was four young believers that left brother Dalton's church Sunday morning and was flying back somewhere and they were killed in the accident and actually one of them the Jonathan McGary was brother Gerald Hughes son's wife's brother so uh she her name is Sister Leona so remember her in your prayers called him yesterday and obviously they're already out there and uh for the funeral so just remember them they were very young um but the Lord Knows Best he knows uh he knows what he's doing we don't we don't question we don't question the word of the lord we don't question what he does we just say thank you Lord that they had time on the earth and that they were good Christian uh young men the 18 to 20 25 years old so just keep the family in the prayers one girl was from Germany one was from Canada so there's families from all over that are affected by that so just remember them so let's turn our Bibles to Romans 4 and get started I it's a little thought that I had been uh kind of running around in my head then we spoke on it just a little bit briefly in Sunday school um this past week and we're going to speak on from Abram to Abraham but a lot of people take and and I think they take Abram and they do away with Abram and put it all on Abraham but remember Abram got promise Abram produced a child and we think oh that was a bad child well the Bible doesn't say that the Bible said he would be a wild child but the Bible I'm going to read you the Bible gave him promise too so there was promised is there but I want you to see I was talking about in the in the Sunday school class we go and type as and we're going to tonight we're going to go through the Book of Genesis where Abraham took a journey or Abram took a journey but I want you to see that that that's a type of me and you we know that for a fact but also even after we're born again you know we believe as as a church body here we believe that that you go through justification not just one time amen you go through baby form justification that cuts off your past sins does away with your past and starts you on a journey then when you come into the body and then when you come into the statue of a perfect man there's another part of justification a a a secret part or a mysterious part of justification that we go back through all right and then in The Headstone there's another part a higher form of justification brother R I'm Tau this you know he didn't teach it verbatim but he said there's a mysterious part of justification that we need to know there's a mysterious part of sanctification that we need to know all right so I believe Abram shows that even to Abraham but let's don't throw the baby out with the bath water because Abram got some promises and and put this little seed in your mind we in the end time have been given a mandate for a body change that's our mandate that's our requirement we're not required to just go through a church age and just be good and just be all right we have a mandate to take a body change we have it's not been given to anyone else it's been given to this age this message and this group of people the people that are dead and G on they cannot fulfill that amen they're part of that Abram which produced something but didn't produce the a promise and then we're going to see that we're going to read a quote here in a few minutes where brother Brown said every son of the faith has got to take this journey in the Final End no one else can take that Journey Brother Dean except the ones in this Final End so let's narrow this thing down tonight that that mandate is for you and I that are still alive not the Dead the Abraham Covenant right wasn't the Abram Covenant sure he got what he needed he got land and stuff but the Abraham Covenant was a body change to produce a child all right so you love the Lord so let's get started let's bow our heads and and pray before we before we begin but just keep your Bibles because we're not going to when we get to Genesis 12 we're not going to put it on the screen we're going to read it out of our Bible cuz I want you to look down and see it instead of reading it from here so no cheating tonight I mean there're going to put it up but I want you to read it in the Bible all right so let's bow our heads and keep these families in mind losing these young ones and uh uh only God knows but you know we don't question but you know what all their trials are over their trials are done they don't have to get up and go to work they don't have to pay a bill anymore they're in the presence of God so which one's better which one's better amen amen dear heavenly father we pray Lord that you would take care of us tonight lead us and guide us you be the speaker you be the hearer you be the active participant in the service father because without you we're just standing here talking about something that we have an intellectual concept of but Lord if you'll come and Quicken the the power that's behind it that this Words As It Goes Forth that you heal the people that you deliver them that they see their self in the scripture that it's not just Abram in Abraham but it's put your name in there and Lord we pray that you just bless each one thank you for bringing each one together tonight we pray Lord especially for that family out in Arizona Lord and different parts of the world that were affected by the plane crash lord it's like I said you you're the one that knows you know best for each one and when our time's done our time should be done and we go home to see you thank God thank you Lord that they were Christians their report of all the ones that come from the report from them were that they were fine Christian individuals so we pray Lord that you just take care of the family now because of the separation and the grief Lord just be with each one we thank you for all things thank you for your healing power that you've helped each one of us get through Lord certain things to make it here tonight father we pray that the Overcomers will get something because the scripture says he that overcometh we'll receive these promises Lord so the ones that have overcome are sitting here tonight Lord we pray that you just be with each one lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus name amen that's what I believe I believe if you come on Wednesday night you've overcome work jobs tired weary whatever you know Sunday's set aside for service most of y'all don't come anyway but Wednesday night is something special but the Bible says he that over cometh it's easy to set home but it's really hard to get up and come to church the devil will make sure that Romans 4:13 for the promise now this is Paul speaking of Abraham for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be HS faith is made void in other words dos and don'ts all right and the promise made of none effect because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it may be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all I don't have a time for a quote tonight but brother brandham said Abraham is the father of this Nation the United States of America because the Bible says he is a father of Nations amen we're here we're here that's what makes it that right because it's the faith seed who is the father of us all as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he he might become the father of many nations so he had to go through something it just wasn't given to him he had to go through it through the Journey according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform and therefore it was imputed or or reckoned or counted to Abraham for righteousness now it is not written for his sake alone it's we're going to bring us in here is not written for his sake alone that was imputed to him but for us also Amen to whom it shall be imputed what this promise if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord Lord from the dead so Paul brings it from the Old Testament and brings it to Jesus Christ in the New Testament you may be SE in the Lord I his Blessing to the reading of the word let's go and read quote one from who is this mzc we've read it before several times brother Dale has also but we're going to read it again now God in this stage paragraph 64 65-21 it is this stage of his creation later formed into flesh Jesus now who's he talking about MDC everybody understand that say amen amen from what from the great beginning Spirit then came down to be the word bringing itself out the word doesn't yet make itself it's just spoke out in morphe later he becomes flesh Jesus mortal to taste death for all of us sinners when Abraham met him he was mzc the priest not the Savior but the priest at the end okay he meets him in the beginning but watch he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end now what are you and I we're the attributes amen we'll do in the Final End every son of Abraham every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing so we can look at Abraham Abram Abraham look and see his journey and you must be able to put yourself in that Journey amen and then he goes on talks about the kinsman redeemer but that's okay right now but every son of the faith so so one we have a mandate to take a body change two we have to go exactly through what Abraham went through because if he's the father of our faith then you are and I are the production of that faith if he's a father amen if he's a father he's got produce something he's got to produce Sons and Daughters of God Amen so now in type we're going to take Abram's Journey just real quick to becoming Abraham because you and I have to go through the same thing and brother Brandon brings it we'll read it in a little while through justification in Genesis 12 sanctification Genesis 15 so he goes through a journey for those of you that are that are new Bible readers you ought to read this you ought to go in your Bible and read Genesis 12 through Genesis about 18 or 19 that is Abram's journey to Abraham and that's God speaking to Abram bringing him through a journey of life I mean Abram to me I I don't think Abram woke up one day and God started talking to him and Abram said I'm special right there's billions of of people going to preach about me at 6,000 years from now no he just got up and lived his life amen amen like Jesus he just got up and lived his life but Abram developing into Abraham because the promise was to Abraham all right through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and about Genesis 18 somewhere in 17 and then come up to brother brandham I I have a couple of quotes we're going to read where brother B says he goes through justification sanctification baptism and the Holy Ghost placing you got to put the adoption in there placing an air amen you got to go through justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost to get the new birth you can you you can still mess up do things wrong okay but now you come up a little higher to the placing uh we we were talking about it yet last Sunday when God bursts you into the body it's the same thing he says to Jesus on the River Jordan This is my son or daughter in whom I'm pleased to dwell but not hear ye him right Jesus had to preach and go through three years of a journey yet he was God Almighty himself so what about me and you right we don't just get it all at one time right he had to go through a three-year Journey we can go through a 20-year journey and just be born again but God remember one thing if you're birth into the body of Christ God is pleased to dwell in you for some reason that's why I told him downstairs I said some of you may not like me I really don't care I don't but God saw something about me that he likeed and that's what I'm going for really doesn't matter to me what you think as long as God thinks enough of me to birth me in the body then he thought something of me saw before the foundation of the world there's a character of that man that I like you ought to think that about yourself I'm G to tell you something we got to take this Fear Part out of it I was telling you know we're going to give you a testimony a little bit later on but but Ryan saw the same thing the other day on a on a sign at a church it says take your fear and make it Faith or from Fear to Faith and I'm working on a sermon from from Fear to Faith cuz fear means nothing remember Adam first thing Adam said now listen Adam talked to almighty God he talked to the Creator every day right had no problem at all until the fall happened and what's the first thing Adam said I was afraid where'd that come from come from here it didn't come from here it came from here same way with you and I amen but if you're not born again the fear is here you better fear something right if your Soul's not born again you better fear something cuz those two I I'll guarantee you one thing those four kids that were in that church service they didn't know that was the last day they'd ever see their parents or or another day they were sitting in a church service and they get in an airplane they're gone not trying to scare you into anything but you know what if they weren't born again but what a mighty God we serve that he's able to produce what he said he was going to produce I'm going to have sons and daughters I'm going to have sons and daughters that I'm going to be pleased to dwell in and then some are going to make it to a journey to where now I'm going to say if you're going to hear anything you're going to hear it from those people people right amen cuz there'll be no body change without an adoption amen even with an adoption there wasn't a body change amen so we got to go on we got to see the air I don't know why I'm doing this but it's not in my notes air that air is you got when you're an air you own it it's yours it's not going to be yours oh yeah naturally we have to wait till Daddy and Mama dies our Rich Uncle dies but not with God he he was slain before the foundation of the world our Daddy's done give us all the things that we need then whose problem is it mine right you can put your name in there if you want to but mine but look Abram was a unique man when he went through his Journey we see that Abram the first thing now let's go and turn to Genesis 12 cuz remember your name means something amen the word Abram means High father it doesn't mean a man sitting on a hill it doesn't mean a guy that sits beside the bush it doesn't mean somebody by the Brook then Abram was able to produce something I hope you're getting something here in other words Abram doesn't mean a man riding a horse right then he's changed to a father of many nations no he's high father right which means he can have children right to be a father you got to have kids amen so God's telling Abram even in this part of your journey the very first part of your journey you're going to be able to produce something well I hope you see it like I see it maybe tonight we'll see something but Sarah look at Sarah now watch her name means contentious and boy wasn't she it was her idea right and even God said listen to her right God said listen to her but that contentious spirit is going to be turned to a princess but God couldn't produce the promised child with a contentious nature cuz remember she didn't ever produce anything now Abram did being high father Abram produced something right all right now Genesis 12 look in your Bibles or you can look here if you want to but mine's so written up in notes so I've got a few notes here that I can use so I'm just going to read my Bible and I left my iPad back there but watch God unfold The Plan of Redemption now watch now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred from thy father's house into a land that I will show thee now look and I will now watch this cuz we're going to come back to this I was telling brother Jo and him in the back and I'll give you a little Point here Abram when he becomes Abraham he's right back at the same spot when he's at when he was Abram the M PLS of mamry we'll read it in a minute he was at mamry went away took his journey come right back to mamry because remember mamry means strength so justification you need strength but you need that same strength over here when you meet mzd all right called Abraham so he called him out he said okay he said sea put your name in there Shaunie sea get out of the land land of Egypt land of the world world separate yourself I'm calling you to do something he called Abram to do something right he knew he was going to become Abraham but Abraham didn't right you know what Abram done he just started to come to church on Wednesday night that's the way the Journey Begins take a Abram put your name in there right start doing something different right because watch verse two Sean this is not you it says I will so God takes over he said I will make you this I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and th will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed right now there's nothing in there about being a prom a promised son nothing because Abram cannot produce the promised son Abram so God's not going to put in there right now but now later on he's going to add a little to it later on in your Journey God's going to add a little something to you all right so Abram departed so he went on I told him we were going to kind of skip around a little bit let's go now to now he goes on and he keeps going on his journey in verse 7 there in chapter 12 says unto thy seed will I give this land and there build he an altar of the Lord who appeared unto him and he was there at bethl look at verse n says and Abram journeyed going on Sean it's a journey everybody it's a journey it's a journey we go through all right but now remember there's a lot of thing goes on things go on when Abram is going through his journey so now let's go to chapter 14 but the problem with Abram was he listened to God but he didn't listen all the way same way with you and I listen in justification you can still smoke you can still do some of the things of the world because remember only your past sins have been chopped off God's not going to remember those anymore but the very next day you do the same thing that's where you're going to be judged again if you continue in that amen that's everybody's Journey no exceptions none you're still smoking you're just ified just put yourself in there you're on your way on a journey if you're still doing the things of the world you know what the things of the world is still in you because God just Justified you he just cut your past sins off right he just said hey I'm not going to remember that anymore but tomorrow I'm going to remember it again because you're on a journey all right now in verse in chapter 14 excuse me chapter 14 we're still under justification we're still if you want to look at Verse 18 of chapter 13 Abram removed his tent came and dwelt in the plain of mamory which is in heon which is called a seed of Association so see that's where Abram started his journey all right now where does he meet mesd in the plains of mammory through this whole journey he comes right back to the same place in justification because remember the Bible says those who he has Justified he has already glorified all right so you got to come right back to that same Journey listen if brother brandham if we believe he's a prophet which we do absolutely if he said every son of the faith is going to go through this then your journey is going to have to parallel Abraham Abram and Abraham if it doesn't you need to start somewhere and say God I'm leaving I'm leaving something but what did Abram do God said Abram separate yourself well Abram separated himself but he took his little demon with him now I'm not calling lot a demon because he was a righteous man but what happened in type is instead of him shedding all of the world he brought lot with him he brought his family with him God didn't tell him to do that God told him to separate himself that's why you can still do the things of the world you can still smoke cuss and do the things you used to do but you're in a journey okay you're not Sanctified yet you're definitely not full of the Holy Ghost yet because sanctification cleans all that stuff out all right I know we have some new ones here maybe it'll help some of the new ones some of you old ones can sleep through it and listen to the tape later Genesis 14 verse 18 and MDC king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Who Abram even in your journey if you're in a true Justified condition God's blessed you amen amen he's done something that he hasn't done for billions of people in the world he called you and you answered amen gosh you talking about a special group of people right even in justification you're a special group of people he met mcdc in justification right that's the same thing with you and I you got to meet God you can't just say God forgive me of my sins and then never come to church anymore and never do the things you know read your Bible and never study and never pray you didn't get Justified you just like they do you find Jesus in jail you know ain't that a problem Sean you go through life and everything's fine you got a little weed in your in you I don't mean to do that got a little weed in your in your car though and everything's fine and dandy and and then you get stopped by the police and they put you in jail and the and the and the judge says you're going to get 20 years for this Sean goes and gets his Bible and he finds Jesus in jail he starts living better because he got caught one more time because he got caught not because there because remember Godly sorrow leadth to repentance that's our problem the Bible says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ we've been baptizing people have you repented that's the first thing you got to do before you go to the water you got to repent cuz we took many to the water and they hadn't repented and they're not sitting here tonight what'd that do just got them wet I'll still baptize them brother Dale still baptize them then it's up to you it was up to Abram to get up and go on that Journey now he might have made a hundred million mistakes but at least he was moving at least he was in a journey at least he was doing something that he was supposed to be doing amen cuz remember when when God started this whole program with Abram he didn't tell him now now Abram you're going to be changed to Abraham you're going to be this and you're going to have he didn't tell him that right he just said I'm going to bless you right I'm going to bless the land that you're in and right here mzc said he blessed him he said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hands and he gave them tithes of all that's pretty good fell at least God met him in his Justified condition right but now did Abram quit now look at chapter 15 just keep rolling up chapter 15 verse one after these things come on after the journey that you're taking after the things that you're doing that are correct see like I said about finding Jesus in jail see people find Jesus in jail and then they'll come to church for about 3 or 4 months every service this is the greatest thing since SP sliced bread never heard anything like this before now listen to me I'm talking to some of you then you stop coming on Wednesday night then you stop coming on Sunday afternoon then you just start coming once a month you know what you on your way out that was the Jesus in jail part and you know what it's okay I'm not I'm not being critical of that but I've seen too many people do that you remember the long haired people they'll cut their hair short they'll hide their tattoos to go before the judge to what make an impression that they've made a change still got it on under them it's still there but that's what Satan does he'll feel Satan's spiritual he more spiritual than we are people right he feels that move of God towards you and he'll beat God there most every time cuz you let him cuz you let him well I can't get to church on Sunday afternoon now because XYZ well what happened to that three months ago that this is the greatest thing since sliced bread and I've never seen anything like this never heard anything like this this is the greatest preacher ever heard in my life I've heard it a thousand times and those people are not sitting here tonight now Abram didn't do that AB what my Pro my whole thing is Abram didn't start this journey and then about the middle he says I'm done I'm done I'm God you can talk to me all you want to but I'm done no Abram keep reading that's what I mean read Genesis 12 13 14 15 16 17 and 18 put yourself in this man's shoes because this is all the sons of the faith Journey right chapter 15 after these things the word of the Lord capital L day so that's God himself came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not there's that word fear fear not Abram fear not Abram hadn't called him Abraham yet God's perfect had called him Abraham yet he's Abram fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and look at verse two and Abram said Lord God now he's talking to the one inside Lord God bring it down now Abraham didn't have the new birth but God was speaking to him right in his senses all right Lord God what will thou give me seeing I go childless now God he knew his name was Abram he knew he was a high father but he hadn't told him about producing a child he hadn't told him he he had said you'll be a father of Nations yet okay in other words some of you young ones God's not going to pour this thing on you because he knows as human beings we cannot take it all at one time that's why Abram started and he said just separate just separate yourself just just get out go on a journey come go walk with me for a little while get around some Believers cuz remember Abram went to Egypt which is the type of the world that was his problem right he come back out and got into Canan and got to feeling better CU Canan land is where we are Glory so he got around a bunch of Believers right why in the world would you want to go around unbelievers right especially in your journey when you're real soft and very impressionable why would you do that listen I've Got Friends of old that knew me of old and they put through they put me through a couple of tests and thank God through God's grace I passed them so you know what that was the separator I didn't have to go up to them and say I ain't dealing with you guys no more y'all drink smoke cuss run around women all this time I'm not dealing with y'all anymore now no I never said that did I Jun I never totally just sat down with my friends and said I'm not dealing with you guys anymore no they would want to go hunting they'd say well we're going to drive would you ride with us well I knew that meant I wasn't coming back till Sunday afternoon see there's the test I said no I'll drive and I'll come back Saturday night so they saw that Journey same way with Abram they saw Abram's Journey Don't you think it wasn't people watching there's people watching you so in that Journey you got Abram coming up through there and remember Paul says Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but remember at one time that man was Abram he had to believe there had to be a faith come all the way through that Journey it wasn't that just Abraham got faith at the Final End right same way with you and I we got got to have faith that this thing will take us through amen and not us right what a mighty God we serve Genesis 15 where was I 15 2 and6 we're reading it here and Abraham said Lord God what will thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house which is elzar of Damascus is the elezar of Damascus and Abram said behold to me thou Hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is my air and behold the word of the Lord came and saying this shall not be your Heir right now remember I don't know about your journey but in my journey I took a lot of Correction me and Hanks the only two that's went through this whole thing one more time thank you all right to me thou Hast given no seed he's what Abram is in a pity party like we do a lot of the times Abram said God You' not given me anything I'm just out here by myself and you've given me no I ain't even got nothing to go on God said shut up verse four says and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine right but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowel so now Abram knows he's going to produce something got it everybody with me say Amen Abram is going to produce something okay out of thine own bow shall be thine air and he brought him forth the broad and said look now toward the heaven and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto them so shall thy seed be right and he believed not on the Lord in the Lord right in other words he was in that Dome or that Spear of Faith where he just said hey God watch what he says right here and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness God counted it or imputed unto him for righteousness because he believed right now your journey is going to be the same way all right everybody okay say Amen amen all right and he believed in the Lord and he counted him for righteousness for he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of Earth that child to give thee this land Abram would have still been in the earth child he was fine where he was at my world was wonderful where I was at wasn't yours I went where I wanted to thought what I wanted to did what I wanted to didn't care a thing about church but something happened something happened to Abram God's telling him say look buddy it wasn't you right it was me remember he said I will I will I will I will watch this then Abram asked a question and he said' Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it now we're not going to go through it but read it and and listen to The Prophet's message go get Abraham's Covenant confirmed and several others brother Dale's preached on it maybe about six or seven years ago and I think I did it maybe a few years ago where we took every scripture and went down through Abraham's Journey or Abram's Journey um because you take takes sacrifices and he breaks them apart and he stands between them and all those things it's all meaning a type of our sacrifice to God because remember he's heading towards sanctification because remember in sanctification sanctification means cleaned and set aside for service not put in service remember Abram is not going to be put into service right cuz Abram's in God's mind Abram's sole being of of of existence is to have Isaac Abram just doesn't know that same way with you and I it's what I said about when we at the beginning at the beginning we got a mandate and God knows who's going to finish this thing up but you and I don't so we have to go through the Journey but if we can type that Journey with somebody in the Bible which is the final resting place of our faith should be in Scripture that we find a man that went through everything that me and you are going through just make it modern cuz remember we don't do sacrifices anymore but you know what we give our body a Living Sacrifice you read in Paul's scripture where we give our body a Living Sacrifice we we sacrifice this thing we don't it does in sanctification it does come to the dos and don'ts okay cuz you're not born again yet right sanctification the unclean Spirit goes out of a man right the smoking the drinking all that goes away right you don't do that anymore that's in sanctification that's not when you get that's not when you become a Christian cuz remember we believe that when you're a Christian you're born again all right Born Again Believers in this ma in this in this church are born again they have God living in their soul they don't do them things anymore okay because that sanctification is where those things have to go out because remember sanctification is cleaned just like Sean if you took a glass you okay if I use ear up here close I fig I figured it was okay good to see you man I love that smiling face but you take a glass if you picked up the glass down at the car lot don't ever pick up a glass at the car lot but if you picked up a glass at that car lot but you know what that you know what God didn't care where that glass came from it could have come from a sewer of sewers right God picks that glass up Sean and he says I'm not going to drink out of it but I got it for a reason amen justification I picked the glass up that glass can be used to drink real good clear water but you don't want to do that with all that dirty stuff in it that's justification you're still dirty inside you still want to do the things of the world you still have that desire but now when God takes that glass and washes it with the water of the word we come to church we do the things right we Fellowship we get around good Believers we quit doing the things we're doing because what God he's cleaning it and setting it aside to put it into service not into service yet he's not going to drink out of it yet he's got to clean it up first cuz remember God will not dwell in an unclean vessel right right so if you're in justification God's not in your soul if you're in sanctification God's not in your soul exactly you're not a Christian right you shouldn't be taking foot washing you shouldn't be taking uh communion or anything like that unless you're born again now that's what the prophet of God said right am I okay that's what he said he said you got to be born again to take communion you got to be born again to do these things foot washing and all those things amen now you can head toward that right that's okay right right but don't just come in here and take communion just because everybody else does because remember the scripture says you're eating and drinking damnation until yourself if you're not in the position to be able to take that's a serious thing that's not just drinking wine and eating a piece of bread that's a commission you know what it's saying when I take that wine and I take that and that I take that bread that I'm clean right that I'm clean and I'm in service for God not putting me in service but I already in service for God so you take the bottle Sean and you clean the thing up God cleans you up puts you up on a shelf and says I'm going to use this guy for something I'm going to use this glass for something right but I don't know yet what I'm going to use it for now God does but you don't right if I don't get finished with this sermon is that okay we're just going to talk to the young people tonight okay young in God but he takes that glass and he puts it up it's clean you can drink out of it but God's not ready to fill it up with anything yet amen all right same way with Abram's Journey Abram was okay in justification he was called high father so he could produce something well Abram is still in sanctification and he's walking with God he's meeting God he meets God himself right MDC is God in human flesh no other so he meets God well you know where you meet God now I'm going to read you a quote in a few minutes it may just blow you backwards cuz we don't look at one man now sure we have a pastor we have assistant pastor we have a Deacon's Elders we have five-fold Ministry but God said MDC was God in human flesh he said now we eat a calf we drink Mel mezic in this group of people not one person anymore Right add don't to make a Baptist SH now look let's go to chapter 16 and we're not going to get finished now Sarah now remember she's contentious woman Sarah means contentious now Sarah Abram's wife bear him no children and she had a handmade an Egyptian whose name was Hagar and Sarah said unto ABR behold now the Lord capital l d hath restrained me from bearing all right I pray thee go into my maid it may be that I may obtain children by her and Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarah so what did they do Sarah was the same as Eve she wanted to produce her own program all right Abram Abram sitting there he can produce right he does doesn't he he does doesn't he right I mean I mean look let me give you a little for those you that that are young Abram and Sarah were first cousins but now that's okay back in the Old Testament because they were from different fathers or mothers everybody understand that say Amen okay so they could have children but they had been having relations since they were just a a teenagers here they are almost 100 years or 75 years old and they've not produced a child so they've had relations all this time somebody was Barren right wasn't Abram it was Sarah the contentious one she couldn't bear cuz it says right here Sarah said behold the Lord has restrained me from bearing and Sarah Abram's wife took Hagar now you can do that in the Old Testament we don't do that in in the New Testament we don't take handmade and concubines and married two or three women if you can handle two or three go ahead one's enough for me and am men say amen that's what I thought once enough ain't it Johnny yeah buddy once enough all right so anyway so now watch here is still Abram's Journey God's still with him because he produces a child amen it may be ish y'all may say he's a wild child but I'm going to read you in a minute where God blessed that boy God said I'll make Nations out of you right now sure they might be fighting but still it was a promise God gave the boy remember he was almost dying there at one time you know Hagar put him under a tree or something and he was just going to die an angel of God that's right not an angel the devil an angel of God came and said I'm going to bless that boy he's not going to die we'll read it in just a second this is what I'm saying in our journey God in Abram's Journey God blessed Abram Abram messed the program up right exactly Sarah the contentious one messed the program up just like Eve messed the program up she was supposed to bring forth God's children but Satan got to her first right same thing with Sarah Sarah says hey I'm Baron I can't produce anything but here's Hagar have a child by her so Abram did what she said and had a child now look watch where the contentious one comes in and he went into Hagar verse four she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes so Sarah is the one that says hey have the child through have a child through Hagar once Hagar gets pregnant Sarah says I shouldn't have done that and I want you out of my house now wait a minute Sarah is the one that put her in that place but here's the contentious Sarah that would be contentious don't you think but look Sarah said unto Abraham verse 5 my wrong be upon thee gee I love you women but my you can be contentious it sometimes know what the Bible says Sarah I said unto Abraham my wrong be upon thee I have given my maid into thy but and other words she's breaking Abram down for having to think she was going to she's the one that told her to go in there when she saw that she had conceived I was despised in her eyes and the Lord judged between me and thee and but Abram said unto Sarah Behold thy maid is in thy hand do to her as it pleaseth thee and when Sarah dealt hardly with her she fled from her face now look at verse 7 and the angel of the Lord capital L O R D so that's an angel straight from God Amen found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way of Sher and said Hagar Sarah's maid when cometh thou and whether wi thou go and she said I flee from the face of my mistress Sarah and the angel of the Lord said unto her return to mistress and submit thyself under her hand and the angel of the Lord said unto her I will multiply thy seed exceedingly right that it shall not be numbered for multitude and the angel of the Lord said unto her behold thou art with child and shalt bear a son and shall call his name ishmail right because the Lord hath heard thy Affliction the Angels tells what what to name that child and ishma doesn't really he is a wild child but ishmail means God shall hear what am I saying in sanctification God's right there with you right he was right there with Abram he was right there with that whole situation that went on God was right there angel of God comes and it looks like they just messed the whole program up and he says no he said I tell you what I'm going to do he said I'm just going to bless this child too right now listen he's not the promised child just me and you right now we can go home now we can go home Ishmael is not me and you ishma is our journey and if we continue and live a Christian Life and die and go by the grave that's okay but there's a mandate from God of one promised child one son take thy son thy only son now ishmail was Abram's son now remember if I was looking at at Abram it Dad now from a world from from say his uncles or aunts he looks the same as he did when he was Abram now that he's Abraham everybody understand where I'm going here same way with you and I this is the same way Dale that hold the beer in the can and right here in my hand and spoke dirty things out of this mouth just as bad as any of you right but this body's the same Abram's still here in body form but when it moved to Abraham there was a promise given right that was a promise giv of a body change yeah what I want you to see is what I saw too is is everybody wants to do away with Abram do away with ishel you want to do that again she's back there doing the same thing I'm doing Ula you want to preach but people want to do away with all that's part of the journey that's part of your journey right in sanctification you can still be a wild child right Pentecost was a wild child amen but they were born again God gave him a promise right just like he gave him a promise just then I'm give you a son and shall call his name ishel because the Lord ha heard thy Affliction he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his Brethren right in other words not separated my whole point is don't throw away Abram right but don't stay Abram right Abram didn't stay Abram Abram's okay Abram takes you through the church ages amen but Abram can't get you to a body change God has to come on the scene and change you right to Abraham to receive a promise which is not just to live a good Christian life not just to come to church every Sunday I sound contradictory when we say that don't but if you don't come to church that's one thing for sure you're not you're not in the Bible all right so so there is a comparison there but it is not all that it's that God has G us a promise GL a promised son we were reading in Psalms the other day where it says this man shall be born in you not a baby a man shall be born in Zion remember we were reading that Sunday school class A man shall be born in Zion we're not going to birth a baby in the end time we're birthing a grown man a mature man somebody knows what he's doing Abram didn't know what he was doing he was just sitting there going Sarah Sarah you just tell me what to do and I'll do it well that's okay you just handle her and I'll just go about my business but buddy when it comes to Abraham I'll show you in a few minutes when it comes to Abraham you watch that Journey come right and Abraham was like a laser beam he knew what he wanted and he knew what had to happen cuz he said God I can't do it cuz see remember right here is Abram a lot of times we think we can do it and you know what we do and mess up cuz he could produce a child but not the promised child cuz God says take Isaac thine only son now remember if the aunts and uncles come to a family reunion they're going to say Ishmael and Isaac are the sons of right but they weren't one was the son of Abram and one was the son of Abraham a promise from God that's what I'm talking about not an Earthly promise I'm talking about a promise from god let's get through this let's hurry Genesis now let's go now remember Abram Abram did I mean Hagar bear Abram a son and Abram called his son's name which Hagar bear ishma and he was was 86 years old when Hagar bear ishmel to Abram so he was still able to produce he was high father he had a kid so he produced that promise and justification you do you produce a promise of God God promises you if you'll get up and walk away from the world I'm going to bless you then is in sanctification that glass is still sitting on the shelf Sean God is just saying all right I got to find a place to put this guy he's clean he's doing the things he's supposed to do but I hadn't put him in service yet all right now watch this though let's go to chapter 17 now remember this is where Abram is circumcised and he gets a name change in chapter 17 so this is the chapter that shows the new birth and you and I because for the for those of you that hadn't read Bible much circumcision was obviously you men know what circumcision is they cut off the foreskin of your of your member and throw it away well that means you're circumcised well see in the end in the at this time God had to give a sign a natural sign a natural sign to Abraham Abram he gave a natural sign right in other words you could show it right the excess part of your skin was taken off the the world this is the world so in circumcision when Abram listen Abram was 90 years old 99 years old when he circumcised himself so there's a there there's something goes with that right you don't walk the way you used to walk righten naturally but you got to put that to the spirit spiritual right cuz remember when God comes and gives you the new birth the forkin of yourself of the world is gone right and you don't put it back it's gone done away with in the sea of God's forgetfulness never to be remembered again Abram was 90 years old and nine and the Lord Capital lrd appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect that's Abram right that's not Abraham yet and I will make my Covenant now here it comes I will make my Covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly Abraham fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee now here he's making a covenant with this man in front of him that's the same way with the new birth this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell you have come through a journey sh now he reaches and gets that glass and said okay I'm going to fill it with the Holy Ghost and I'm going to put it in service because you know if you set it up you put a glass on a shelf and it's not full of anything what good is it do what collect greas yeah collect G and dust if you leave it there long enough cuz remember the Bible says the unclean Spirit goes out of a man but if you don't fill it with something guess what that Demon's going to come back back with seven other worse than him and they're going to try to they're going to fill that glass with something you'll get religious you'll get religious but if you'll take that and God says hey I've got this thing clean now I'm going to fill it full of water so that others can drink from it now Sister Gil they couldn't drink from it when it was empty there was nothing in it right but when God takes it off the shelf and he fills it full of water you know what when God FS something full of water have you ever noticed it never goes dry you just keep drinking it keeps filling up you keep drinking it keeps filling up that's God that's the same way with you with the Holy Ghost others drink from you then others drink what you have it's like brother Dell said he said that's the only thing he's ever had a possession that you can't buy with money but you want to give it away every time you as soon as you get it watch this neither shall thy name anymore verse five be called Abram but thy name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee now here's the program he's telling him exactly now you're going to be a father of many nations verse six is the same as Genesis 12 vers vers two I will remember we read it in Genesis 12 when he first started his journey in justification God said I will God said I will look how many times I've read this thing look my Bible's about broke apart verse two says I will make thee a great nation I Will Bless Thee I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee now let's go back over here now he's coming up in from justification to sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I will make thee exceedingly fruitful I will make nations of thee so obviously he's going to have to have some children and I will make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of thee Kings and Priests and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee and their generations for an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee watch how God's bringing it together and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger this is strange this is strange this is a Strange Land this won't inherit the Kingdom that's right amen wherein thou art a stranger all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God look how confident verse 10 this is my Covenant which you shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised all right so we go through that and we see the circumcision versus uncircumcision uncircumcision means you still got part of the world and God can't use you God can't make you walk different he can't do the things that he can do because you still got a lot of excess skin flesh worldly stuff all right everybody understand everybody gets the type I know most of you do but we got some new ones here and they need to understand this cuz look if every son of the faith has got to go through this journey you got to put yourself in this right here you got to put your name in this journey right here and take that same identical journey in type you understand me in type so you got to see your types you got to see your types and your shadows in the scripture and the only way to do that is to come to church and listen CU somebody will tell you something and God sent un to Abraham now he's not Abram anymore he's Abraham and God sent un Abraham as for Sarah contentious one thy wife Thou shalt not call her name Sarah but Sarah shall be her name shall her name be now Sarah means princess that sounds a lot better than contentious let me marry a princess not a contentious woman yeah and I did absolutely and I will bless her and give her and give thee a son also of her now here God has said look he's finally said who he's going to give the sun through okay see that's what I mean about in your journey you read the word of God and you don't really get a lot is that all right you don't really get a lot you just believe you believe in God you believe that people people can help you but there's a time when you come to a new birth where you got to have a relationship with God and he talks to you and you talk back okay now and I will bless her and give thee a son also give thee a son also of her y I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations now God's never mentioned this before cuz Sarah is contentious you don't want a contentious woman to be it's like you know raising bees when you raise bees you you look at the character of The Beehive if that thing's if you watch outside and everything's running smooth and those bees are going in and out and and you open that Hive up and they're doing their job and everything's cool you got a good Queen she's a prince you look and you see if she's laying eggs everything's fine but you let something happen to that Queen we had one the other day go queenless we don't know if it died or they killed her or something because those bees if if the queen doesn't do her job they'll kill her cruel world but they make their own Queen and then they raise up one of their own so we go out there the other day we buy a queen and we're getting ready to put the queen and I said June you hear that this other Hive over here is just as quiet I mean you got 60,000 bees in that Hive they should be making a noise they just barely humming over here because this one's got a queen this Hive this Hive doesn't have a queen and it sounds like a buz saw that's how it sounded didn't you they were queenless they didn't have a queen they had no guidance they had no no no no uh stabilizing Factor she had become contentious and the whole Hive was upset but see you put a queen in there a princess it calms everything down amen natural types of spiritual then Abram listen and I will bless her and give thee a son also of her and yay I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations Kings of people shall be of her then Abram fell upon his face and laughed Abraham not Abram and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that's 100 years old and shall Sarah that is 90 years old bear and ABR Abraham said unto God oh that ishma oh that ishma he's heading back in the other direction oh that ish may live before thee God just promised him another son and God said Sarah hello I'm sure God went Abraham well now he not ever done you that way yeah well then you're in the same Journey Abraham was in kind of knocks on your head and go hey hey get your attention like brother Tom F Bush said get their attention get their attention you punch somebody nose you'll get their attention I promise you that and God punched Sarah Abraham in the nose and said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name Isaac and I will establish my Covenant with him right the Next Generation with him and with his seed after him now and as for ishma he's not finished yet he's not forgotten and as for Ishmael I have heard thee behold I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly 12 princes shall he beget and I will make him a great nation but but I'm not finished he's going to be a wild child he's not going to be able to take a body change he's going to be a good Christian he's going to live his life he's going to be among his Brethren is that not what he just said in the Bible he's going to be among his Brethren he's not going to be separated he's going to be among his Brethren but my Covenant will I establish with Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year God's bringing it right down and said look this is where it's coming from right from right here so he goes and he cuts off the forkin and chapter 18 we see what happens and the Lord capital L LD appeared unto him in the plains of mammory he's right back to where he was in justification same place positionally everybody got that say Amen naturally Abram has took this journey now now he's Abraham God's giving him a promise now now Abraham knows where it's going to come from not another woman it's going to be Sarah and you're going to call his name Isaac so he's got it all he's got the program together and the Lord appeared to him in the plains of mamry and he sat in the tent during the heat of the day so he's right back to where he started at now look now they're in a condition for a body change cuz remember Abram was Journey Sarah was contentious Abram was the high father but now you and then they produced ishol which was a wild child now God said no Sarah no not Isaac see what God's doing when he when when God brings you the new birth and when God gets ready to place you it's all positive this is my son in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him hear what's going on all right so now we just be a few more minutes now they're in a condition for that now let's read the second quote quote number two Jehovah gy Long Beach California did you notice his name was a r h a m Abram Abram Abram then when he changed his name he gave him a name of ab a r a h a m Abraham taken in his own name Elohim making him a father see remember we get a name change that's a new birth right everybody wants to look for a name change over there you get a name change now you're Christian Jun got a name change when she married me amen she's a Dale now she's not a Thomas anymore she's a Dale she took on my my name so when we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you repent and you go through this journey and you do the things of God and God burst you into the family your name's not whatever it is anymore it used to be drunker liar Thief stealer reviler name them all no you're Christian you're part of the family of God now see now you can partake of the communion now you can partake of the things and remember there are promises for ish so there's promises for everybody amen there's even promises for the foolish virgin there's promises for the 144,000 but it's not the promise that you and I get as being the Bride of Jesus Christ do you see what I'm talking about we're Abraham seed not Abram amen but he give us a part of his own name Elohim making him a father he's Elohim and he changed and put put part of his name on Abraham because he through the promise was to come through his seed father of Nations Abraham changed his name put part of his name onto it now making him a father of Nations now notice to Abraham and to his seed after him now not to his seeds but seed after him remember Galatians 3:16 it's not the seeds of Abraham that gets the promise there's a lot of people that was born even of Abraham that didn't get anything remember he got married to cout right or one of them it's over here somewhere is that right coutur I don't want to be wrong on that I don't want to but anyway they had about seven or eight more kids but you know what when he got ready to die he did give him a little something but he said Isaac is going to get the heir of all things same way with you and I I noticed Abraham and to his seed after him I not his seed but seed after him Abraham had many sons but the promised one was through Isaac and through Isaac came Christ The Royal seed the real Seed of Abraham all right the real Seed of Abraham amen so in Abram and ishal there's no body change Abram just had ish he' have to have a body change he could produce what he had right amen but remember the miracle was that Abraham and Sarah were almost 100 years old and required to produce that's the great mystery of you and I people look at you and and of course us males we don't change a whole lot because we we don't have to wear dress and long hair and stuff like that I hope not but the world can't see a difference shny if you become a Christian started coming to church here normal people would just see you as a regular person just normal but your actions and your reactions will tell what you are but see the sisters they can walk down through Walmart with their long hair the long dress no makeup no earrings you know what that makes you different so we as the Bride of Jesus Christ though we are female right amen we harp on the women all the time we're all women in the body of Christ so we should all have long hair and spiritually you understand what I'm saying not naturally in other words we should look different to the world even us males because don't don't fool yourself these little kids and that world is watching you cuz remember there's no other God they're going to see right hello there's no other God they're going to see but you and you can be contentious Sarah but God wants to change you to Sarah right to be a prince princess all right so Abram and ishal no change nobody changing Abram and ishm Abram's a good guy ish's a good kid ish's not that bad he just he's a wild child he's just different from the other because he got a different promise right same way with you and I we got a different promise and and remember even even Sarah what we look and we see there in chapter 18 Sarah there's God now remember MDC meets Abram Abraham meets Abram in justification now he's meeting Abraham in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the placing changing his name all right so God meets Abraham Abraham says my Lord and and God says you going to have a baby according to the time of life well Sarah goes back in the tent she's 99 years old or close to it and she starts sniggering she says me having pleasure with my Lord again natural she was thinking natural she needed some Faith problem is she had a little fear but what the problem was she didn't look at the promise that's why listen that's why Abraham is the father of our faith he looked at the promise he didn't look at the circumstance same way with with when with Ry and Gabby that you got anybody you got to the the circumstances are just that circumstances hey if you go to the hospital they going to stick you full of something they going to put a tube in you down you through you you going to look like not very healthy that's circumstances that's man's way of doing things that's man's idea that's not not God's way of doing it we got to look past that take that fear and let that fear sure we're all human we all have fears but turn that fear into Faith right that's why a lot of you think I'm hard about things but I just have faith I just believe God's going to take care of the thing your situation or mine God's just going to take care of it you know you you sat around and I'm sorry you sat around and you talk about well I wonder why this one died and I wonder why that so what they're gone what does it matter that's circumstances get up and go a great example King David remember the first child God said is going to die Bible says King David he' laid down on the floor all night long sackcloth and Ashes prayed to God for that baby and you remember the servants the servant was afraid to tell him that the baby had died because they thought man if he's acting this way he's going to go ballistic when he finds out that baby's dead well he perceives and looks at him and sees and says hey is the baby dead they say yeah Bible said he gets up goes takes a bath puts on his King's robe go sits down and eats bread and drinks wine and the servants are going and they ask him David David said there's nothing I can do now the only thing I can do is is make sure I go right to where he is right now boy you talking about something that settles all fear right something that settles anything I you know it I've never lost a child but but losing a child would be the the probably the worst thing in the world but being a Christian you have to do the same thing David did get back up put your robe on right go to work the next day testify that God's the greatest healer that there ever was know one thing for sure that God knew better than we did about what was going on and forget about the circumstances that's right now look if every son of the faith has to go through this journey let's read number three we're going to read three and four together Abraham's Grace Covenant Middletown Ohio 196 61 how they sit there now wait what's he doing he's showing to Abraham this what's he going to do to the Abraham seat now what was he on the road after Abraham after that he had been Justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost in topes and shadows so see Abraham wasn't filled with the Holy Ghost in tops and shadows and had been placed got a your name then he came and he was giving a sign that the end was at hand he come down to destroy the the wicked sinful world of Sodom is that right now remember Jesus said Do you believe him Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man right there's no doubt we're in a sodomite condition right well Sodom all around but now look let me read number four it's it's a continuation down to paragraph 65 and the man God dwelling in flesh the man with his back turned to the tent said why did Sarah laugh saying in her heart that it can't be so told what Sarah was doing and what Sarah thought in her heart when she laughed to herself is that right what was it just a little bit before destruction he's doing the same thing to the Seed of Abraham and they don't recognize it Brethren that's 1961 they don't recognize it do they recognize it now I don't think so some don't he's doing the same thing to the Seed of Abraham and they don't recognize it Brethren see what I mean justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost placing of the sun air God dwelling in his church human flesh eating drinking like man the Holy Spirit oh you know what people in the congregation are going he's talking about himself no he was talking about them right if they had a new birth dwelling in his church human flesh eating drinking like like man and the Holy Spirit God himself dwelling in the sons of Abraham manifesting the same thing that Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of son of man do you get it amen MDC is not someone that we meet on the plains of mammory like Abraham did it's somebody you meet in church our fellowship our Bible study remember mzd became Jesus Christ and Jesus melz listen what was in in MDC is in you so there's not two Gods what was in mzc sitting there talking to Abraham is in you tonight right now the form it had to take another form to get into you cuz mzc couldn't die for you mzc was a priest of the most high god without ending of days or beginning of days or ending of life right but he became Jesus Christ so that soul of MDC was Jesus amen amen we know that we preach that but I'm for the young one the soul of MDC was Jesus Christ not another person amen one God and Lord of all sir brother Bram says Abraham say God Jesus goes down tells the people in hell I'm the one that you turn down he comes back up through Paradise knocks on the door he said the first person to open the door was Abraham right Abraham said Sarah that's that man we fed a calf to well who was it Jesus Christ the theop of the man that had died just recently right in this Dimension was in another dimension and Abraham recognized him right now he's took a different form he's hid himself in his people amen he's hid himself in his people right it's not one man anymore come on all the god you're going to see is right here tonight it may not be me I'm talking about you amen amen amen but now watch I was telling the Sunday school class this is to get all this down to one thing if every son of the faith has got to take this journey at Final End right all right this was the thought that came to me the other day and we're teaching downstairs on the Statue of a perfect man and we're on brotherly kindness well now let's go to Mark 12 Abraham actually fulfilled the two greatest Commandments before the Commandments we even written oh I'm glad you're quiet Mark 12: 29 says and Jesus answered him in in other words the Scribe asked him say what's the greatest of all commandments of all 10 what's the greatest Jesus answered and said the first of all the Commandments is here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord one God and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind with all thy strength this is the first commandment verse 31 says and the second is like namely this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these I'm telling you people come downstairs sometime and let's talk about brotherly kindness some of them head's been rolling in the floor boy you ought have seen them the other day when I told them because you know what brother Brown said the the example of Brotherly kindness was in the book of Acts the whole congregation sold their possession and give them to Peter money and land any y'all want to try it then you ain't got brotherly kindness that's what brother random said he said they sold everything gave it to Peter remember that's where ananas and sa fire came cuz there was two people a husband and wife team that had sold some land kept some of the money and just give them and said is this all it wasn't that they it wasn't totally that they kept the money is that when Peter asked them said is this all and they said we give all well they were lying Peter didn't say you li didn't lie to me he said you lied to the Holy Ghost well now what the Holy Ghost tell him to do sell everything everything bring it common and let brother Dale distribute it to us they got quiet just like you got quiet brother BR said that is a perfect example of Brotherly kindness you do what you want to do but that's what he said and it's the second of the greatest of two Commandments you shall love thy neighbor as thyself and Abram Abraham said no we'll talk that in just a second hang on so Abraham what's the first thing Abraham says to MDC when he sees the three walking down the road what does he say he says my Lord he got his one God Doctrine right here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord Abraham had a revelation that that was God and them two beside wasn't Jesus and the Holy Ghost amen amen so he got his one God Doctrine that's the first commandment second commandment you say how did that happen after all that happened God said I'm going to Sodom and I'm going to destroy that Nation I'm going to destroy every person down there what Abraham say love thy neighbor as You Love of yourself he said God if you can find 50 people would you spare Sodom if you can find 20 will you spare Sodom God said I'll spare it you can find 10 will you spare Sodom look at the look at the kindness of the man now Abraham didn't have nothing to do with Sodom he didn't like Sodom he didn't go to Sodom but when he saw God getting ready to destroy a Brother come on people brotherly kindness is one of of the hardest things we're going to have to be able to conquer because it's right up there next to love you got to love your neighbor I don't care if that neighbor shoots your dog I don't care if that neighbor is so contrary to you it doesn't matter you got to love that person as you love yourself not just it's easy to love it's easy for me to love June cuz I love her because she loves me but how about me loving somebody don't care a thing about me right see that's what Abraham so every son of the faith has got to take that final Journey there's those two greatest Commandments and Abraham is producing them in that one scene he knows that that man's God and there's no other and then God said I'm going to Sodom and I'm going to destroy everything down there Abraham said God please they're my brothers they're my neighbors they must have been close because remember you could turn and look and see got him from where Abraham was that's what the Bible said so God says no if you Abraham said if you can find 50 you know he got down to 10 well you know there was four down there he didn't get down to four you know what if he had said four God would have spared Sodom amen lot his wife and two two girls they were down there but he stopped at 10 Abraham if you can Abra said if you can find 10 God said if I can find 10 I'll spare but he couldn't find 10 so he destroyed that Nation but do you see what I'm talking about every we can't just take this journey of Abram and disclude it because it's important it does produce amen then you got the Journey of Abraham which produces something different amen not just be born again and live a good Christian Life that's okay but our mandate is to go on and produce a son and God's got to change our bodies for for us to produce that son and we're in the change now but watch how that God through Abraham in Genesis 22:5 this is the last one let's stand musicians come and Abraham said unto his young men now God had told Abraham Abraham Johnny the Bible told Abraham God told Abraham to take that one son that he had now you've only got one son he's your son he's your promised son there's nobody else he's only the one that's going to perpetuate your species your your your generation okay God tells Abraham should go up there and kill him that what he said take thy son thine only son Isaac and go sacrifice him but watch Abraham in the spoken word I know people said well he can come back with a spoonful of Ashes that's not what Abraham said Abraham said unto his young men I'm not afraid I'm going to take him up there anyway that's right I have no fear abide here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to you you that's right Ryan that was from Fear to Faith you and I would have been so fearful to say God you give me one child to create Nations out of that child and now you want me to go kill him no there circumstances If Abraham would have looked at all those circumstances no the Bible never said he staggered he said we're going up there right and I'm going to trust by faith that when I walk in that room that's my baby that's my child and though man says it's going to die though we've done everything we can do because Ryan and Gabby came to Bible study that night I didn't know this till he told me later they were expecting that baby to die right I told him I said Ryan you walk in that room with fear and that baby's going to feel it you know what I said I said you walk into that room with fear that baby's going to feel it I said you walk in there with faith that none of that's going on you can't deny what's going on baby's there baby's sick but you deny what the doctor said you have faith right you have faith for that baby cuz that baby can't have faith change that fear to Faith tell them what happened from that point Ryan said from that day the very moment they walked in that room from that day till now that baby's got better every day every day hallelujah oh we'd love to have a miracle and have her here now what does that matter the human body if there's not an instant Miracle the human body has to go through a process to get rid of all the drugs that they gave the to get rid of all these things that the baby that tracheal tube and all that stuff you know there nurses and people that's had them before I've never had one but it just tears your throat up so you know little baby the same way your body's got to heal but my point is Abraham took that child up there and he said me and that child are coming back now he didn't say I don't care what God said he said no I heard what God Said I know what God Said but I got a promise Isaac can't be ashes and me bring him back he said the lad and I will return He said same way with you and I you when you go through a problem say God whatever the problem is the lad and I will return amen oh you see a lot of problems happen and you go man I I've never been through this problem before you know what somebody has and there one thing for sure Jesus knows all about it anyway when are we going to do that one thing take God at his word right regardless regardless now put your yourself in Abraham's shoes I've only got one son that the promises to be made through and now you want me to go kill him he went and done what God Said but his attitude his attitude changed didn't change God's mind but it changed the circumstance right cuz remember he was getting ready to kill the child he wasn't up there trying to yes and trying to figure out how to get out of it that's our problem a lot of times we try to figure out how to get out of it no he raised the knife he was going to stab that child God said now I know in other words God really he said that but God said Abraham now you know that I'm with you and that whatever you say what do you think Jesus got believe on that mountain it's what you say to this mountain it shall be mve right amen Abram's voice Abraham's voice thundered into heaven the lad and I will return God thought so much of his son he said that's exactly the way it's going to happen right same way with you and I any situation we're going to sing a song tonight let's turn to page 389 we've sung it before but tonight's a very fitting night to sing this song and I listen if you can't sing I want to hear

songs oh it can harm our body and Satan we live in Satan's domain and he just beats us to death but all if it's well with your soul what does it matter what does it matter what's the circumstances make any difference God never dealt with circumstances you going to have a son Abraham well now you're 99 you can't produce you're God don't have checklist we make checklist what we should do and shouldn't do what should happen and what shouldn't happen but down inside there's only one sense Faith or doubt Faith or doubt that's it there's no gray area there's Faith let's put it this way there's Faith or fear there's Faith or fear in your in your Walk of Life we thought we had the world bull by the horns they say we were indestructible that's a lie that was Satan's way of giving us something to appease what God wanted to give us but if you'll be real honest with yourself if you're not born again there is fear there is fear and even being born again we have a fear of God okay we have a fear of God which is not like that kind of fear because fear that fear of God is reverence of God we we fear that we're not worthy enough but you know what there we go again making checklist no it's Well with My Soul if it's well with your soul if we're Abram if we're Abram and don't make the change we still got a promise we're going to come up we're going to live in the city we're going to be just as Eternal as God is but listen people like I said before there's a mandate I'm sorry we stayed this long but there's a mandate of Abraham coming on the scene meeting MDC and taking a body change somebody will do it now you need to figure out whether you're under the ministry to be able to do that or not and if you are then stay there if you're not find somewhere cuz that's your mandate God will tell you if you're honest enough he told Abraham he said Abraham or he told Abram walk before me and be perfect then he said I'm going to change your name then I'm going to change your body then you're going to bring the child you love the Lord thanks for coming and listening tonight we appreciate you pray for brother Boyd and he said to tell people thank you for the prayers he circumstances it's hard to get over that same thing is it's hard to get over brotherly kindness to love somebody that hates you but we must do that and you know what God has not give us that and then said there's no way you can do it if he gave the promise he's got to make a way to get that promise fulfilled by us in human flesh if William brandham could stand on Earth and they couldn't tell who was his enemies and who was his friends that's got to happen to me and you plain as day and and Abraham showed that so perfect he said oh God please don't destroy my neighbors I love them if you can find so many but he couldn't but here we are in the end time and it's it's going to be the same way sodom's going to be destroyed but we still have to have love for the brethren we still have to have love for the people you love the Lord let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you for tonight we pray that something's been said Lord that will help the people father that that we'll all take this promise of of Abraham and see that Covenant fulfilled in our body Lord we pray that you just touch each one of us Lord be with the ones that are sick the ones Lord just ask for prayer truly bless that family Lord us out those families out in Arizona Lord just be with them in their time of grief father give us our daily bread until we come back again with you on Sunday Lord to visit one more time father we pray that you'd just take care of us lead us and guide us by the Holy Spirit in Jesus name amen you're dismissed there is a flag flown
