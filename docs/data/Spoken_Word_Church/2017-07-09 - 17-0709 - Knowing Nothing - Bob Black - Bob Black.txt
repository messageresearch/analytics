[Music] recorder god bless it more efficient more oh really so I'm gonna this morning I'm just going to launch it to try and just kind of a little slow methodical little teacher and we're just going to go through the scriptures and talk about the importance of the word understand commitment about occupation and I took maybe a strange scripture for this maybe off you can see the topic your knowing nothing sometimes we get we misinterpret some of the things that brother Graham saying we can almost get in our head that that is unjust to not even understand anything about the message then it's fine just you got to go along with just a little read some of the quotes a little bit but we'll just kind of talk this morning about the importance of understanding what brother Branham taught that it's important to know what the message is about is not it's not that the end goal here is not just to say well I believe that God sent prophets and I believe that the message is bright and those kind of things but it's important to know what the message is about now maybe this morning we'll talk about a lot of things that we're all familiar with and we've heard before but it kind of I think it comes helpful to kind of review just maybe so that we can see that our and understand the times that we're living in and kind of understand the things that are happening around us as well and maybe also just to have sort of will have an answer when maybe somebody comes and and prevents some things too you'll be able to have a response and this scripture that I found this will first slide it and the list of him to have others any wisdom Israel belies for the back of him that Android of understand my kind of strong you know when we compare that with a child child run around I didn't know I was supposed to say we could used to liquor the job then it's time for spank it so you give a little whooping but so that they'll understand this time we'll the same time in the same way in the Apple accessories something good that Paul told the tires so Titus was set up on the island of Crete and all said look they're silly to begin to teach people and kind of fall down to second couple numerous set up some ministers because bishops you know and that elders in each church so that the people will be able to be educated and these are the simple words that Paul gave to titus instead for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers specially they of the circumcision and he's a special enabled in other words the people that should have been knowing what they were talking about didn't have any understanding they didn't know what they should have known because they were just going based on intellectual conviction and and told policies and very great words here they didn't know what they were talking about and this is his worst to title as he sent him up on the increase and telling it not to approach the ministry to tell them not to approach of teaching people and had to approach his ministry they said whose mouths must be stopped who subvert whole houses teaching things which they ought not for filthy lucre sake in other words for their own personal in it for for the blessing of the people but they're in it just sooner that they can get following and get money and things like that he said one of themselves even a prophet of their own said the cretians are always liars evil beasts slow bellies this witness is truth now see a lot of times we kind of people kind of you know must get to the point where you don't like playing somebody just appreciated what somebody tells it to set it out there on the table where you can see it and you can even disagree with it or three it nepal's is pause is laying out there the accretion don't tell the truth and it's Sunday Monday when you get this from let's go throw this crime real real quick and we'll read the poet the Prophet that he's talking about the minute he was this was the guy's name it he what he wrote this poem about Mizzou's and I'm just kind of quickly flipping over to this whether you have a little bit of context and he wanted to convince the people that deuce was immoral but he said they fashion attorney for the ill holding and I warned the cretins always liars evil beasts idle Bailey's that now are not dead i liveth and abideth forever frenzied we live and move and have our being so F amenities was the profit to the credence try to convince them to instead Zeus was not just somebody who could have died and was immortal and all those things so that's were Paul getting that the cretins always liars evil beasts idle really and he's agreeing with it and so he said wherefore rebuke them sharply that they may be sound in the faith not getting any P to Jewish fables and commandments of men that turn from the truth so that's the whole point of the gospel to raise up people that are swayed by every wind of doctrine that are grounded and rooted in an understanding of what the scripture is what the Scriptures talking about and who Jesus Christ is and then when you begin to see Jesus Christ is you can begin to see your pardon him and so without understanding without knowing what the gospel is about you're using the whole essence of what what this is it proverbs please agree to the prudent man proceed to evil and itís themself but the simple past home and unpunished proverbs 28 5 does equal men understand not judgment but they that seek the Lord understand all things Ephesians 4:17 18 says this I say therefore and testify Noah that he gives birth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them they call the deployment of their art and you can see on these scriptures that whatever you get a chance maybe it certain just do a search across the Scriptures a bottle first and find all the little references of ingress and no understanding and blindness and having your mind dot you because that the purpose of the gospel is to enlighten us and to show us these things so that we're not we will be walking around not knowing which way to turn not new you're not knowing what what to do Hosea 4:6 says my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou has rejected knowledge I will also reject me - thou shalt be no priest to meet seeing thou has forgotten the law by God I will also forget that children I'm just going to kind of go through so many scriptures talking about it acts 17:30 at the times of this ignorance God winked at but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent so there's a time there's a season where God will wink at your ignorance when you begin to hear about the gospel on the day of Pentecost Peter came out and begin to preach a nice day you know if you asked him what do you believe the people that are sitting out there on the street they would have said I don't know I need somebody to teach me to tell me something they said openly to brother what should we do and Peter was able to tell them he knew he had understanding of what the Scriptures were I'll tell you what you need to hear you repent I think you need to die being baptized at the time of your death the top of your dinner reservation without a lot of dying a type of being dying taking up your cross and dying with Christ and you come up and rest in a reservation a type of communis of life and then you help an insurance is going believing that the whole ego the promises to you and so the people out there that there is a point in your life where you don't you're kind of growing you need somebody to teach you so God weeks is that period at the ingress but there's a time if going along with when we need to come to a place where we begin to other state he had the point of the day in the weeks you will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he has given assurance unto all men and if you raised him from the dead and literally of this scripture right here for a second Matthew 16:23 this is way when when when Peter was kind of fruit it divided he rebuked Jesus and he said that you're not going to die the way that you said during Jesus will say that that you don't have to die so forth and and Peter turning mr. Lord not stone and Jesus turn right you and he said baby turn it instead of the Peter get thee behind these take an hour and a fits unto me but our favorites not the things that real God but those that billion so what does that work favor mean I don't know if you can see that I'm just going to read it that's worth favors and agree in the word throw nail and it means to plead to regard to be minded to save her to be of the same mind down here and read says to have understanding to be wise in other words Peter didn't understand what was happening what was taking place and so when you begin to understand you begin to that number they have allowed to direct one's mind to a thing to seek to strive for when you begin to understand importance of the opening of the word then that will become your objective and that's why we're the eldest of a new birth is to be inward all the way because you continuously strive for that your that's all the did you mind is to get closer to God you just begin to desire a stick and strive for that to get to get more understanding now you know there's two different kinds of understanding there's an understanding from the hand and there's an understanding what they'll drop valley to the heart if you believe it and open the door to faith over the door of faith so they will drop down into the heart then that gives you a spiritual understanding so there's two different kinds of understanding that it can overfill the confusing one up you first you have to have that mental kind of understanding there's gotta be somebody that lay it out for you so that you can be and these kind of have that you know note you know there's such a thing that salvation know that God can do something for you in your life that you need to repair and then those kind of things and you let it drop down in your heart so that it can become a living reality and change your life so that's maybe my for this morning is it it seems like many maybe this almost sounds a little bit critical huh so we're saying that you don't need understanding and you're miss Chloe but rather where you said to just just you don't have to understand just believe well that's true because you start out now not understanding from a spiritual standpoint but you must understand from the head standpoint let's have it lay it out there for you now to look at some of the closer program said and Satan beat I don't think you got it because I've already ordered I'll read it think they were that I don't know it is mistakenly in the 96 poverty today so does ministers and seminaries learning man-made theology it may it be right it may be a good understanding of the thing but it's wrong and may be a good mental understanding and maybe just to put this in a context like life for example Augustine who studied the scriptures and laid them all out and he got in his hand the idea that if the people won't believe that will force them to believe that and then he began to kill the people because he said if you won't believe what I believe that it would be better for me to kill you let's force the people to believe and he had a mental understanding a mental concept of what it was to be a Christian even though he had started it out and had it all in his he and lay it out in his mind and still it was not a correct spiritual understanding so that's what I believe that brother I was speaking over he said we all have to understand it we believe it because God said it's though and that settled it forever and he said oh how evil up stood to have a PhD see how she lost it to be smarter than what you will so let's look at some examples of this where what people try to understand it before God gives them what spiritual revelation or spiritual understanding this is this is what he's talking about Latif where God spoke and justice 1:28 he's getting God bless them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air over every living thing that moveth on the earth be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth so it comes along as she's sort of tried to she doesn't know what that is yet she knows that is true because God spoken of course it's true but it's laid out there but she tries to put her own mental content to it and it gets it all twisted up he had tried to figure it out and it produces Cain because she's trying to figure it out with her own life wait until God reveals it to you and then you'll know you have that spiritual understanding because you can't figure it out but when it when it when God comes on the scene then you know and so maybe if I'm jumping ahead a little bit and so my slides if God has revealed it to a man they can hear behind the pulpit and he knows because God has come on the scene and building with the Holy Ghost and he knows what the revelation is and he's presenting it that's that's what the gospel is you can trust you have trust in that man because he's got the word though God had come on the scene and spoken through that man it is revealing his word for that man there's another scripture they are 714 really [Music] really obvious of working that there for the Lord and stuff shall give you a son behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel well there's another scripture that people trying to figure out they all know through the ages is it going to be this person or this person who's what kind of person he god I actually do this and even though God has spoken it but when the time change for that baby to be born they'll want to know more figured it out it was the evidence was right there so God purpose is a word when God brought his word and passed and there was no more question they had an understanding of what that was what I was supposed to be Mary knew with that well as you went and be any problem started to Elizabeth and son of the door brother I said as soon as the Lord Jesus was was spoken from her lips then the child Elizabeth woman begins at leap for life because she was speaking of a revelation of the day God had you know there is she was speaking about a revelation because now she knew she had an understanding of what this scripture was and I've replace it because it seemed like when God when God interprets his word there's no more question you have an understanding and then it can be communicated it can be imparted to others so they're saying that we don't have that we don't even know what the message is about that that we don't have to have to understand that there's all of these your message is something that can be probed and questioned and and there's no way to understand the thing to deep things I believe it the reason brother Graham came was to give the bride a message so that we could become one with the word and receive it and a grouse become one with that miss mark 9:31 32 the pre-college disciples of said the son of man is delivered into the hands of me and they shall kill him and after that he is kill he shall rise the third day he plainly told them what what that was you know it's that famous question that he asked Peter who do you say that I was son of man am he even told me to the engine who do you say that I was so demanding and Peter didn't quite have a foreword he had her of the revelation that was a church to be founded on down to the seven churches the revelation of the Son of God he said I know who you are the son of God but that revelation of the Son of Man will be hidden until just of just here the last the last and so he tell them the Son of Man is delivered the hands of men and they shall kill him and after that he is kill he survives the third day but they didn't have a spiritual understanding of what was happening so wait until God and services onward and then you know but my point maybe this morning is when God and purposes murdered then you know and you have an understanding of the day and hour as you're living into what's taking place in this spiritual that this kind of scripture Jesus said the woman at the oil which he began to he begin to tell her about the things that are alive and she asked that famous question well ok well where are we supposed to worship my fathers worshiped in this mountain and you say the Jews saying you're supposed to worship it in Jerusalem and he said I'll take you where I worship you worship in spirit and truth and people are beginning to realize because the world is beginning to open up how I worship and then she begins to realize you know the Bible said I've been taught that the Messiah is going to come so he had been taught that the Messiah was going to come but now the Messiah was staying there in Rome it's right there so the things that she didn't understand before now it was right there right there standing in the front of her she said I know that Messiah cometh Testino - so my hippo burst to make some and destructed her which is called Christ when he has come he will tell us all things and he's offended her I that speak unto the end he and writing as she opened up the door of faith and to see that and it went running down into the village killing everybody and now she knew who the firewood she had heard about it but now she did and see the importance of having understanding of of seeking and savoring the word this little story of Jesus telling the disciples that except to eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood you have no life now of course they didn't understand that and you know this is when when Jesus begins a the first part of his ministry he cast out Devils you know started off kind of the first the second pull start off slow but then he begin to drop the truth and and that's when people begin you know in the assembly lips then they will fail it up after you begin to say these things he's dropping the waters laying out their truth can you receive it and so many said oh well this is I don't understand it so I I'm going to have to leave it I'm going to have to it's too harsh you know and and so Jesus asked the disciples are you going to leave also and and the Peters famous response Lord to whom shall we go that has the words of eternal life that that's the most important thing of all you know you think of this little span of life where things are hard and sometimes even going to church is hard and it seems like sometimes maybe friends abandon your things and things get rough and there's so many struggles and stuff but think about this little three-panel true when you got all eternity laid out and before here if you'll just accept the word of the lower so that's the most important thing for any of our lives is the word of God and if you can grasp that if you can see why that's so important then you will begin to savor the water you'll be into hunger after it beyond everything if you hungry thirst for the world of the love of world do you the love of God is not in you because you're still hungry after those things and creating anger thirsts for the things of the world it's better for the word that's what John 626 miss Dillon says labor not for the meat which perishes but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life will a ver it's a labor and that's what Paul offered labor that you might enter into the rest labor and even after you enter into the rest you're resting but you're still labeling your you're hungry you're searching out trying to find the word let me give you a little illustration the Bible says then man in the wilderness was like coriander seed this is coriander seed over land so it was about that size and if every morning when they woke up they would go out and it would be scattered across the ground if you didn't get it by noon that it was dissolved it will be gold so you had to hurry you've got to get everybody got you the homework reach man so that is about the side of court inside of the coriander seed and it looks like valium which is this Robin so it looked like that though this is the description from the Bible so if you can imagine it being about that size and about that appearance that's what the man and the wilderness look like so every morning it would wake up and they would see - scattered out and and I want to name the people as they began to go out I thought it should be easy to get it up off the ground just doesn't go out just look so long and your work is done but if you think about the size of this and just amongst the rocks and things and it takes a little bit of effort to get an overfull for each man which is not about nine and a half cups to get nine and a half cups of this for every man and and then Saturday you got to get done for a person so that you carry over 230 so it's always been an effort it's an effort you know find out the word remember those six dreams that the different people in brother branham's church had and one of them was with the cow going through the brush trying to find the little green plus trying to find that food cutting it out and brother branham's aluminum alone we call it a labor it's an effort to find the word that you have to put it out it's not going to be this late in your lap but if you're savoring the things of God if you're straining the word then it will be a joy to you and get is a word and find those little nuggets where it just begins to open up to you and where first it was all your like throwing in darkness but then the word begins to come together and you can begin to see a picture clearly then you know the word man I know there's a lot of speculation about what that word means but what what one person says debt up the word manna came from this scripture in numbers 11 6 but whether the Israelites are kind of complaining and they said now our soul is dried away there's nothing and all beside this man before our eyes their complaint they didn't know they didn't know in other words what it woman and so that's what they strong is number says that the word man it goes from as you can see it right here the meaning of it is what is wood they didn't know what it was and that's maybe my point this boy is do we know what the word is do we know the value of it that is not just something that we have a feel of understanding of then we're just kind of going along trying to try to know more than other people but as to the Word of God will change us this change that's what Elementary's the power of transformation when you receive the word and begin to become the word it takes you out like it took the Israelites out of Egypt and you get to you out of the world and they get to remove you from the world and you begin to eat one day this word that we been feasting on will take us from the world your boat it will change or more funny how we be quicker so we don't need to be saying what is it we should know what it is an importance of it what it what kind of question but God is giving me food and their responses out what is don't know what it is and they begin to be getting grumpy about it and it will wait you know God has made it in this layout of CNAs yes so we have it so easy week we should be able to lean back in our recliners and put the tape in and to put them open the Bible and relax and study the word but we're so relaxed it is we got to the point where we just do it do we really savor the Word of God today and that's worth a whole nother than a scripture from from Hebrews four nine were prompted let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief because it is a late your Lavery and struggling and striving even though arrested because it's not your words your horse cries to live in you but you got to bring water to you so that you can open it up and it I have a paradox in the word is in you but you have to bring the word to him then he could so he can open it up problems 12:11 he that killeth his land shall be satisfied with bread he that followeth vain person in void of understanding some if you follow somebody that's just in it for their own game you will be void of understand well then we'll kind of get in it that's my brother instead false teachers will bring false birth true prophet will bring the word the birth of the word of Christ false prophets will bring all birth the birth of churches the birth of preach the birth of denominations and he goes on declared Iowa false teaching is Paul's teaching gets you away from the word being the birth of the word it gets you over looking at evidence evidence being sensations and anything told anything other than the word being born that's the only evidence the evidence for the new birth is to receive the word for your day the evidence of the new birth is to work bring the word Baur the evidence of a new birth is and that you're in the word all wait the word is being over to you and then down to the end the last couple of years but every sense that famous message fate is worse expressed because when the word comes in you begin to believe it it will produce the life of Christ and now you've got the evidence you got the light of Christ expressed in you so so see if if the word of God is come on the scene if does is there then it can be preached it can't enough it's not like the message is some something that we just nobody really understands I just believe that God for the problem because he came so that we would believe what he brought what he taught now I know this was got up this you've got a saint that will ever everybody heard so many times there's been but I'm sure gravity so look look at this another quote that's so many misinterpret and you know this is one of the things that in the message today who can interpret what the ransom note end on Wednesday so and so there's so much confusion there's so much you know kid is it possible to know what more around me at least space he said God need to nobody to interpret his words because his own interpretation by bringing to pass the things that he said he would do we got to him to let there be life there was life that needs no interpretation it's clear a virgin shall conceive and she did the son of man goes up to Jerusalem given advance of sinful man they'll crucify little referred he'll rise again that needs no interpretation you get a little while and the world fiddly little more yet we shall see for our be weave it into the into the age to the consummation he is here it doesn't need any interpretation the worst that I do shall he do also either believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and we know that that three so it doesn't need a interpretation let's just read this friendly quote God don't need anybody to interpret this word he interprets his own word when he said anything it happens that the interpretation they don't need anyone to say well I believe that means this God I didn't find it by his own interpretation me so that sounds like well it is not appreciated let's just kind of let's just read the Bible around and we'll just like begin in the early the beginning where it says Abram and did according to as I don't like to get out at home whatever he want to be he said the reason that they had this to teachers to my opinion now they had interpreted the word because they all believed in it coming sighs always relieved it may be yesterday but the reason that they didn't recognize him his message wasn't according to their ecclesiastical fear they their interpretation they had of the word the Messiah never manifested himself in the way that they had interpreted that he was do it so God will come on the scene is show the correct interpretation of the word if man tries to interpret it by their own understanding the ecology ah that's what Lauren said mountains the seven churches men the water began to Auckland but man was always probing in it so God had to send a prophet all the same to straighten everything out and this is the quote lay off the interchange of the roads that there are those who say that God's people are going to come together through a collective revelation in other words that there won't be one man a prophet that comes on the scene to straighten everything out but everybody will just kind of have get come to there come to the to the right understanding altogether these are not challenge that paper this is a fault and valid assumption in the face of Revelation ten seven there is one prophet messenger to the Saints and he said he will need to speak for himself of God must be ported by the voice of the son so the Prophet goes on the scene he begins to speak a message to interpret the word the people to get giddy if God is interpreting his word by revelation let's see what it says here in Tennessee in searching he says but thank God of this moment this age is not a room get down to the pole he will speak out and those who receive that prophet in his own name whereas these have been a beneficent effect of that property minister and they that hear him will be blessed and become part of that bride of the last day who are mentioned in revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come so now you got the bride speaking where she speaking she's speaking the same thing that she's heard the messenger speak she can't get out under that messenger so the messenger has the correct interpretation of all the things that people probe that doesn't the seven churches but now the true interpretation has been given forward so you can receive it and hear it and become one with it and then you can begin to speaking he says what he says from God the bride will say the spirit and the profit of the bride will be saying the same thing and what they will say well had already been said in the word they are saying it now come out from a monitor now and he snickered they're saying it now is what he did they're saying it right now they're speaking the same thing the cry has go out the cry is going out how long with a voice cry we do not know but one thing we do know it won't be long for this is the last eight and then there's that quote that we're all for me with them I'm running out of time so a rattler it's just just a thing there in the beginning other people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final eight how is that possible because they're saying well the messenger saying they're not saying oh I believe God to a prophet and I'm not sure what is what he brought I'm not sure what the evidence of a new birth is and what the new birth day is or or how to get or what the cast stone is or even they you have to grow that there is such a thing that the statue of a perfect man or they have to come to adoption to body change or all these things but they they have an understanding of what this message is the bathroom [Applause] let me just get through this these talk about interpreting a message of being able to preach and this is the example that you gave aware how how do we know what to dislike what I will finish them in this life is pillar fire they came down accepting he told and he said then he talked about what that filter fire is about the body said then if you race through the dead here's his picture scientifically they into the same Pierce's works reveal that you the same but the reason you're looking at it and maybe compare that with a Bible to the reason you're looking at the bottom and looking for what the Bible say in their provider quote the reason you're looking at the call from an educated person like myself is bringing your message don't you look at the messages look at the message I'm talking about a man for the message is more than God's and a prophet the message is what's going to take us in Iraq [Music] [Music] that place
