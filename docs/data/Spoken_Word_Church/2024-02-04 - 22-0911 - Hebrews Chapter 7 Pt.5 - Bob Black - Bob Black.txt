========================================

through that chapter today Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word Lord and I pray God that you'll just Lord O open these things up to our heart as we study these scriptures Lord today and and unpack the things that Paul said uh thousands of years ago Lord we asked it Lord you'll just be with brother wait as he's preparing Lord God and open our hearts Lord Jesus to receive what you have in store for us today in your name amen now we're uh you know just to just to kind of summarize what we left off in Hebrews you know we Paul Paul kind of set the stage that we've heard from someone greater than all the prophets greater than greater than the Angels the the one that we've heard through is is God him heard from is God himself and and uh you know Paul I I you know you read what Paul's saying and sometimes it's hard to understand but he's it's such an encouraging message that he's bringing in the book of Hebrews he's telling us to do do better than the Israelites who who uh who kind of gave up in the wilderness who got so complained in the wilderness and and kind of got foged down with uh with their own own desires and and and lost sight of what God wanted them to do to make it to the promised land and and and Paul's telling us to strive to enter into into the rest enter into the rest that uh the rest of God's word where we're not resting on our own works or or what we're doing in ourselves but we're resting on God's promises and then you know really the theme of the book of Hebrews is is uh we'll get to it in in Hebrews chapter 10 that I've got here up on the sleep on the slide but the the law is a shadow all those things in the Old Testament were a shadow of something that we have access to now they were speaking of a life to that the Life of Christ would be given to us and all the things that you see in the in the Old Testament Tabernacle and the rights of the high priest and the uh the the way that things were conducted all the the the the way that the everything in the Tabernacle was built and the way that the priest behaved and everything was a shadow speaking of of Christ's coming that he would Tabernacle himself and us and so really you know when you when you read through the book of Hebrew uh read through Hebrews chapter 7 and and you you begin to look at what mil what Paul's saying about melkisedek you you really need to uh have it within that context of what that is to really understand it that that Paul's he's trying to make the case that um the chickens are moving around my backyard again I got to ignore that Swip Paul Paul's trying to make the case that that the the law there's there the law has to change that the priesthood has to change there's coming a New Covenant the Covenant has to change and so he's set setting all that uh in view as he's as he's explaining about who who is this melkisedek who was that melkisedek so Hebrews chapter 10 says for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect so what's Paul trying to lay out for us in Hebrews that that if if you want Perfection it doesn't come and he's writing to the Hebrews it doesn't come by what you think God wanted you to to to you know by by trying to fulfill some the the law by by working it out and trying to trying to just be a good person trying to trying to be a good person like the uh the Rich Young Ruler that came to Jesus and said well I've done all these things but he Jesus told the Rich Young Ruler you yeah but you're lacking something what you what are you lacking you're lacking a relationship with Christ you're lacking Life of Christ a personal relationship with Christ all of those things could I make the believer per perfect Perfection only comes by Christ and so that's that's really who is melkisedek that melkisedek is the one that can make you perfect so you know we we need a we need a priest after the order of mezc we need a priest that could uh so Paul in Hebrews chapter 8 he's saying for if that first Covenant had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the second if that first Covenant was faultless then you wouldn't need another Covenant you wouldn't need another Testament there was something lacking in that first Covenant the first testament for finding fault with them he saith behold the days come sayith the Lord and I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt because they continued not in my Covenant and I regarded them not sayeth the Lord now you you you last time we talked about how that you know that they had been searching for that Royal high priest to come that they looked for you know the requirements couldn't be met in the flesh by by Abraham or by Isaac or by Jacob or Joseph but when this man come out out of nowhere melkisedek he come here's the one that's going to be able to satisfy now maybe maybe just kind of sit in your mind what's what's the difference between that me melkisedek and Jesus the difference is the melkisedek when he came he he could he couldn't he couldn't uh God's got to come in the flesh to be your Kinsman so the difference is that when when God put that life in in in that manger now he's manifesting the flesh so that he can bring to pass that new test that New Covenant that uh that God could come down and die for your sins and pay the price for you and atone so so the melchisedec couldn't Usher in that new cut New Testament he couldn't he couldn't move move you into that new New Covenant but Christ when he came he could and it's you know don't get in your mind that it's a different people it's the same God it's the same person the whole time now now you you talk about um let me see okay here we go let me get my slides mixed up so Hebrews chapter 7 when we were reading it says uh in verse three it says without uh well let's just read the whole thing again for this melkisedek king of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness what that that's actually what melkisedek means meel uh Meli is a is is is actually the Hebrew for King and sedc is is uh Hebrew for righteousness so you know the the Hebrew I was listening to this Rabbi talking about melkisedek and boy he was all confused he was saying that that Paul raped Jeremiah's words and all sorts of horrible things that but anyway the way that the Hebrews pronounce melkisedek is they actually pronounce it as like two different words melis sedc so you you take those two words King and righteousness and Tack them together and you got what mzc means the king of righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest continually now consider consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the SPs now let's just rehash what you know looking at uh verse three there without father without mother without descent you know we talked last time about how that that God just just flipped everything that the Jews understood on his head when he this man when Christ finally came he come out of the tribe of Judah in other words he just threw out all kinds of genealogy so I think that's one of the the Great greatest uh misunderstandings that people in the message have is that that your that your new birth or your eternal life or any kind of relationship you have with God is tied to any kind of genealogy so see you see how God is just throwing that all the way out it's not he didn't he this Christ did not come tied to any kind of genealogy like that but this man doesn't have a father or mother is he doesn't you know you think about think about Christ when he came that that the Bible says in Matthew chapter 1 the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost so Mary wasn't his mother he was born of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the one that that created him in the womb that created that flesh that that his life was the Holy Ghost he he didn't have Joseph wasn't his father Mary wasn't his mother because if you make Mary his mother like like a lot of the denominational ideas then you got some kind of you got some really a perverted picture of how he came he came into life so so this melkisedek was without father and mother and then when he was manifest In the Flesh Christ was without father and mother because it's the same person the flesh the flesh is not what matters you see he took he he he just disgarded all the genealogy your flesh has nothing to do with whether you're born again I wish I I wish we could kind of get get that completely burned out and baked out that that we how you come in this natural life has anything to do with your with your new birth I was talking to somebody recently that's uh uh you know just well I'm not going to get into that listen listen Peter even Peter when he uh when he began to preach and began to unlock the door he unlocked the door to the to the Jews and the Gentiles and the Samaritans and who did he unlock the the Gentiles and the Samaritans were the people that the Jews thought they had no way to receive the new birth a gent a gentile dog or a Samaritan that that uh uh that everybody looked down on that they don't even know where to worship a Jew was thinking well we got to we're special because of our genealogy and here God flipped everything on his head and gave the Holy Ghost to people that that they thought were just dogs why because there's a promise in the scripture whosoever will whosoever will let him come we've got a we've got a supernatural family tree we got a we got a a genealogy that that that uh a genealogy of above what's our genealogy Genesis 1 12627 that's our genealogy that you were predestinated in him so so what's melkis melkisedek was that life now brother R would say and who is melkisedek he said think of this great person of how great this man would must be which is what what uh what Paul said here in in uh verse four now consider how great this man was andto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tent of the spoils so who was he he was a person a man a personality an eternal person brother ad said he was God because he's the only person that can be immortal and now God changing himself into person the same person the same person all the time veiled in flesh he was the Su the supernatural life is what mezc that life that's behind the veil which is what Paul says in in in chapter 6 he says which hope we have an as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast this hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and it and which entereth into that within the veil which is that flesh the veil that he entered into is that flesh whether the Forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made an high priest Forever After the order of melkisedek now now you see why how we we're tied together uh melkisedek come out seemingly out of nowhere the king of Salem and he brought forth W Bread and Wine and we're timeing that we're tying that in together with with one day Christ as when that melchisedek was manifested in the flesh there in the upper room he gave his disciples Bread and Wine I I I hope I hope we can tie that together in our mind of what that's that's that same one that offered Abraham Bread and Wine and now he's as he ushers in a New Covenant he's given Bread and Wine to his disciples this is the New Testament in my blood what's the difference now melkisedek couldn't bring in that New Covenant but Jesus could bring in that New Covenant MK Jesus could because he come to die for our sins so in in Hebrews 7 and: 22 he says by so much was Jesus made assurity of a better Testament a better Testament and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death but this man because he continu with ever hath an unchangeable pries to he's got he he's entered into behind the veil not like not a curtain in the wilderness behind the veil of your heart wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them so now now see what is what is this new C New Testament that he's speaking of the New Testament in my blood that there Jesus in that upper room he said after the same manner also he took the cup that Paul speaking speaking of about the communion when he had up saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as you drink it and remembrance of me what what is that new testament the New Testament the Old Testament is is is putting you in prison that you you to to to show you that you're you're in prison and you're you as as much as you try like David God said he was a man after his own heart but yet he he was looking at baath Sheba down there on the roof of her building uh taking a bath and and you know he there he needed something to to brother brownman I was listening to a message while I was working in the yard the other day and he said David had the word but what he needed was the spirit he needed that Spirit to Quicken that word to to live in him that's that's the thing that makes you perfect that's that's what this new testament is the Life of Christ and the believer to perfect you and change your heart and change the way you think and change the way you live and and give you something that can that can fulfill the law so what's the difference M kedc could wasn't able to get you out of the prison house but this new testament will will break your chains the New Testament makes a way for you to get out of the prison house for the law to be satisfied in Genesis chter 14 we looked at it and and melkisedek king of Salem you see me Abraham paid tithes to melkisedek because he realized he was getting something from this man he realized who who this man was that he talked to you know when you when you come to church and you you realize your chains are being broken and you realize you're hearing from God and you come expecting then then you come with a different attitude you come with a different a different outlook on things and you realize like Abraham did this is the one that fought the Battle this is the reason that I could come with only 318 men and defeat all these all these uh uh like the Navy Seals and the Army Rangers of CH ched om and all of them that he was able because God was only on his side and it says he gave him TI he gave him ties of all because he recognized who he was serving you know you know uh brother Brown laid out and and when he was preaching who is this melkisedek that melkisedek is is one person all the time one God and he would say we find that many people teaches three Personalities in the God's head say you cannot have a personality without being a person it takes a person to make a personality so who was when when melkisedek when Abraham paid tithes to melkisedek he was recognizing that one God when when when the three men came walking to him in the cool of the evening and he met him there in the tent door he he didn't recognize three different people three different gods or three different like like that but he knew who he that that man was somebody that he had met before that's why in Matthew 28:19 it says Jesus said go and Bap and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost and then in Acts 238 it says Peter said unto them repent be baptized everyone in in the name of Jesus Christ because it's one God and Jesus is is his name what's what's the name of that king of righteousness that melkisedek king of righteous that came and talked to Abraham his name is Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is his name because he said I come in the father's name I come wrapped everything that I stand for is everything that I am all my qualities all my attributes I I come to represent that God that nobody knew who his name was in the Old Testament and all the time God has changing himself in morphe in morphe means changing like a put putting on a mask where you change from one character to the other you know that uh maybe I'm I'm I'm kind of running through some of these quotes a little bit fast so I I'll try to slow down a little bit but and morphe comes from in Philippians chapter 2 where it says who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a serpent and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient under death and morphe mean morphe is like morphe is uh the the the definition of it is the dictionary said English has no exact equivalent unlike form in English morphe does not mean shape it is a philosophical term that means the outward expression of an in Inner Essence so on the outside you might look like uh look like you know mechis DEC come walking on the outside you look like like Jesus Christ on the outside it start on the day of Pentecost God put that same life into the Believers so on the outside you've got uh uh you know a different believer Peter and John and them but on the inside the Inner Essence is that life the same life that was manifested in melkisedek so brother R said the Greek word there in morphe means that one person is changing his mask to make him some other character what's the point Paul's trying to make that this man Christ Jesus that paid for our sins that that that that brought in a New Testament is that same man that walked that that walked and talked with Abraham he said that's what God did it's the same God all the time God in the form of the Father the spirit the pillar of fire the the same God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and morphe brought out so he could be seen and now that same God is the Holy Ghost you look I I got a little slide of showing an actor you I don't know if you know who this actor is it doesn't really matter but it this this actor portrayed like like putting on a mask he put on uh in one movie or one film or whatever he he he's portraying this first character and then the next one he's got a top hat on and the next one he's he's got uh he looks different and and and the next the next he's got glasses on and each each one he looks a little different but it's the same person all the time and brother rman said and who is this mckisic he said changing himself in morphe from one person it was taken from the stage act that one person is changing his mask to make him some other character brother and going talk about how that in the beginning God dwelt Alone and he said what made Jesus and God different that Jesus was the tabernacle that God dwelt in see now melchisedec Jesus had both father and mother and this man never had father and mother Jesus had a beginning of Life and he had an end of life this man had no father no mother no beginning of days or ending of life but it was the selfs same person it was melchisedec and Jesus was one but Jesus was the Earthly body born and fashioned after sin what what what's he saying he had a father and mother he he was he was he was born in flesh he come into the world so that he could be your kinsman redeemer there's your there's your difference between this mkis melkisedek and Jesus Jesus could die for your sins and and and make a way for that life to come back into the heart of the believer but it's the same person all the time and who is this mekis DEC he said his first being was Spirit God Supernatural all right the SEC the Great Eternal second be to form himself towards flesh in a theophany called the word a word body this then is the state he was in when he met Abraham was called melkisedek he was in the form of theophany he was the word so in verse six it says but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promises and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better and here men that die receive TI what what's he what's point he's trying to make he's he's trying to make the point that the priesthood pay ties to this man that Levi the priesthood came from Levi so Levi not just in tight but brother B said in the spoken word is the Original Seed Levi paid actually it was counted as though he actually paid tithes to melkisedek and so the priesthood that came from Levi was less than this man melkisedek cuz he's the one that that made them the priest of the Old Testament and here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witnessed that he liveth and as I may say so say Levi also who receiveth tie paid tie in Abraham for he was yet in the loins of his father when melchisedec met him oh you you think about how that that that Levi Levi actually paid ties and and you in the same way the life that you have by the new birth was actually there in that melkisedek wrapped up in him because you you are actually that your life is actually part of Christ your life is actually part of him that's why we make the statement that as Christ is revealed as you as you read the Bible and you see the revelation of Christ being made known and the word unfolds then it can't help but also reveal you because you're part of him so as his word is revealed to you you begin to understand you yourself and your own journey and your own life and how you fit into that because you're part of him that's that's what that's what the Seven Seals reveals it's you're placing you placing you putting you as part of this as part of this great plan and brother say the thought when it's expressed it's a word a thought expressed is a word but it has to be a thought first so it's God's attributes then it becomes a thought than a word if you have eternal life you always was those who have tonight eternal life was with him and in him in his thinking before there ever was an angel star cheram or anything else that's Eternal and brother Brown he made this statement and who is this MDC he made this wonderful statement that I love he said after he thought it he spoke it and here you are a manifestation a manifestation of that same life back there in Genesis 1 12627 back there that talked to Abraham that you were in him you were part of him that's the story that's that God is that Paul is trying to unfold that Levi actually paid tithes it was counted to him even though even though he was what uh Abraham's great-grandchild Abraham Isaac Jacob Levi and uh that God thought about you predestinated and we're going to get into something really interesting here but you as we kind of close in the musicians can go ahead and come forward but we'll we'll stop on this but brother am will say even though even though God thought about you brother R in the Hebrews chapter 7 he's laying the point down that what what you're doing right now is what matters your attitude towards Christ will make a great impression on what your children will be your life that you live before your family will make an impression on what your children will be cuz the Bible said that he would visit the iniquity of the parents upon the children to the third and fourth generation and in Genesis Chapter 18 the reason he said the reason I make all these promises in this Covenant with Abraham was because in verse 19 he said for I know him Abraham that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he ha spoken of him and we'll just stop right there you love the Lord this morning am let's be in great expectation for what the Lord has in store for us today and make the Lord pleased with us and our thoughts and our actions this morning amen
