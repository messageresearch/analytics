[17:23] study we had a good time at least I did
[17:26] so that's you know know want everybody
[17:29] to hear what we talk about on these
[17:31] services and we had a real good time
[17:33] went up to the Ruth meeting and had a
[17:35] good time there good services and
[17:37] everything and they took up I believe it
[17:39] was
[17:41] 106,000 wasn't it 106,000 something but
[17:45] $106,000 that they took up for the for
[17:48] the uh missionary uh people things and
[17:52] and you know it would help it wouldn't
[17:54] enough cuz they had a couple $1,000
[17:57] request but you know still it's enough
[17:59] to to take what we could and do what we
[18:02] could you know in the church we always
[18:03] do and we always tell you when to come
[18:05] back where you won be wondered we always
[18:07] put in at least
[18:09] $3,000 offering into that from the
[18:12] church okay so everybody would know that
[18:14] you know and we do that and they I know
[18:17] they certainly appreciate it amen we're
[18:19] glad to have brother Quinn with us he'll
[18:21] be ministering for us today and then

[18:47] because of the cake and ice cream after
[18:50] the evening service and everything for
[18:52] our wedding anniversary uh 58 years
[18:57] today am
[18:59] 58 years and I telling somebody last
[19:02] night there's one thing about it I
[19:04] probably wouldn't be and was talking
[19:05] about it coming up this morning or the
[19:07] other day I probably wouldn't be where I
[19:09] was at if my wife hadn't wanted to go to
[19:11] church so when we got married she wanted
[19:13] to go to church cuz you see I wasn't a
[19:15] Christian of any form back then and I
[19:18] just you know she wanted to go to church
[19:20] so we went to church and I thank God for
[19:22] that so the family's built on that part
[19:25] of going to church there's never been a
[19:27] question of whether to go to church or
[19:29] not or what to do it's always been
[19:31] settled and finished so we we thank God
[19:34] for that amen and I appreciate my wife I
[19:36] want to give her a hand for putting up
[19:38] with
[19:39] me for 58 years and it's not been fun
[19:45] I'll agree but that's all right okay
[19:47] we're glad to have brother Quinn with us

[23:44] they've got their big base they're right
[23:45] on the border of of of Israel that's

[24:00] when we always celebrate uh our morning
[24:03] service you know the uh uh Dawn Service
[24:07] uh my people love that and uh we were

[24:11] even death does not scare the Seed of
[24:14] Abraham death does not scare the Seed of
[24:17] Abraham because we know death has lost
[24:20] its thing amen see so it's it's

[24:36] today if you wanted to see it uh when we
[24:39] were in non pan with him in in Cambodia
[24:42] I haven't been in Cambodia for about 10
[24:44] years but he said would you come down

[25:02] will be here but the pastor but all the
[25:04] people that could come had all walked in
[25:06] the hot sun just like that there how
[25:09] would you fancy a two-hour walk in that
[25:10] Sun out there and they do it they had

[25:27] stilts the house is built on stills and
[25:29] you might think why that cuz if you're
[25:31] standing underneath that it causes a a
[25:33] draft and you can feel a nice cool wind
[25:36] hitting you there you know and right
[25:37] beside the house uh we took the
[25:39] photograph of it is where uh the church

[31:36] Holy Spirit wants to do amen and he did
[31:39] the same thing he just handed it over to
[31:40] the Lord you couldn't do any better than
[31:42] that I remember when we did it in Africa

[32:48] power by whom also he made the world's
[32:51] how did he make the world's Church by
[32:54] his son Hallelujah n who being in the
[32:57] brightness of his glory and the express
[33:00] image of his person and upholding All

[33:18] the angels as he ha by an inheritance
[33:22] obtained a more excellent Name than they
[33:25] For unto which of the angel said he at
[33:28] any time Thou Art my son this day have I
[33:32] begotten thee and again I will be to him
[33:35] a father and he shall be to me a son and
[33:39] again when he bringeth in the first
[33:41] begotten into the world he saith and let
[33:43] all the angels of God worship him which
[33:47] they did when he was born Hallelujah

[34:38] Genesis here so would you turn to it
[34:40] just a moment Genesis chapter 1 and we
[34:43] could actually quote it verbum amen but
[34:45] in Genesis chapter 1 we'll just read the
[34:48] scriptures and it says and God said let
[34:51] us make man and our image after our
[34:54] likeness are you glad Hallelujah let
[34:57] them have dominion over all the fish of
[34:59] the sea that's the human form amen and
[35:01] let the fil of the air and over all the
[35:04] cattle and over all the Earth and over
[35:07] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[35:09] the Earth so God created man in his IM
[35:12] own image in the image of God created he
[35:15] him male and female created he them and

[40:02] that Prophet Hallelujah to put us on the
[40:05] right straight track Hallelujah and
[40:07] that's where it's going to take us
[40:08] because it'll take us somewhere amen and
[40:10] so we do serve a wonderful Creator this
[40:12] morning sir amen and uh this morning I
[40:16] want to speak praise the Lord on Oneness
[40:19] that's the title of the message I don't
[40:21] know if it comes up here or not I don't
[40:22] know but amen Oneness that's what that's
[40:26] what I want that that night when I stood
[40:28] in the presence of almighty God in the
[40:30] throne room that is what I wanted amen
[40:33] that was my heart's cry that I would be
[40:36] one with God hallelujah one with God
[40:41] Amen and that's what I want to speak
[40:43] about this morning uh uh Oneness of God
[40:46] and his people just Oneness Hallelujah
[40:48] one with God and uh you know it's a deep
[40:51] desire it's a deep desire now the thing
[40:55] is this morning if you had a
[40:57] questionnaire and you were asked in this
[41:00] life we're all human beings amen you get
[41:03] up in the morning you have to eat your
[41:04] breakfast you know you go to work you do
[41:06] whatever you have to do we're all human
[41:08] beings but if I ask you really what is
[41:11] your heart
[41:13] desire that's that's the question what
[41:15] is your heart desire what is your goal
[41:17] in life right because I was listening
[41:19] that we were at the at the uh uh cracker
[41:22] barl yesterday and you know they got
[41:23] this kind of uh division and on the
[41:26] other side this guy was talking about
[41:28] business and he was talking about hard
[41:30] we're going to get the business you do
[41:32] this you do that this will do and you
[41:34] know on big business and I thought
[41:35] that's that's that's that's their goal
[41:37] Hallelujah get the business up make
[41:39] multi-millionaires here to themselves
[41:41] and well that'll be their goal if they
[41:42] have changed that that's up to them amen
[41:45] but that's not my goal Hallelujah my
[41:47] goal is not to become a millionaire I
[41:49] don't want to be a millionaire I
[41:51] wouldn't know what to do with a million
[41:52] dollars folks I have to give it away or
[41:53] do something Hallelujah but you see
[41:56] there's a desire in your heart and
[41:58] that's why you're here this morning
[41:59] brother Gary that you can't you can't
[42:01] even maybe explain it Hallelujah but it
[42:04] is there Hallelujah it is there and what
[42:06] is your goal you know some people might
[42:08] say well to get to heaven that would be
[42:10] nice to be in the Rapture that would be
[42:12] nice amen that would even be the wrong
[42:15] goal because your goal must be God
[42:19] himself and I'm going to try and explain
[42:21] it to you explain it to you as best as
[42:24] best I can amen it must be God himself
[42:28] amen now that would be the correct goal
[42:31] praise the Lord uh we know we know
[42:35] there's no question even the the most
[42:37] humble person here this morning would
[42:39] know that we're born with a thirst we're
[42:43] born with a thirst brother Len for God
[42:46] we can't explain it but we're born with
[42:48] that thirst all over the world the
[42:49] natives and you know uh are born without
[42:53] thirst they want to worship something
[42:55] sometimes they don't know but you can
[42:57] come and show them the true way to show
[42:59] them the true worship that's what Jesus
[43:02] said to the woman that God wants those
[43:04] who will worship Him in spirit and in
[43:06] truth that's what he desires so there's
[43:09] a that that hunger that thirst amen for
[43:13] God even as a child we were talking
[43:15] about it yesterday and I just didn't say
[43:17] anything at all but amen as a child you
[43:20] know there was something there you may
[43:22] be playing out there with the other
[43:24] children and you just feel something
[43:26] around you and you what and then you
[43:28] just carry on plane you didn't even know
[43:30] what it was Hallelujah something just
[43:32] there with you there was always it was
[43:34] always there amen and there was a deep
[43:37] calling onto a deep Hallelujah I said to
[43:39] brother Samuel this morning it was good
[43:41] that sister Peggy I wanteded to go to
[43:43] church praise the Lord but God would
[43:45] have got him some way Hallelujah uh
[43:47] you're you're a Son of God Amen you
[43:49] didn't become a Son of God the day you
[43:51] got saved Hallelujah you were a Son of
[43:53] God way back in the thinking of God
[43:55] before the foundation of the world he's
[43:57] going to get you somewhere amen under
[43:59] that token Hallelujah and so there's
[44:01] that thirst that hunger we couldn't even
[44:03] explain it couldn't even explain it
[44:05] Hallelujah even his children amen and
[44:08] you know a deep calling onto a deep we
[44:10] didn't even know what's happening
[44:12] Hallelujah but God was working on us
[44:14] hallelujah cuz he had plans the plans
[44:17] that I believe the brother read it
[44:19] Isaiah 55 today but there again and and
[44:22] Isaiah the plans I have for you are good
[44:26] their plans that are good plans
[44:27] Hallelujah and and so it's wonderful and
[44:30] and that deep amen like the little boy
[44:33] eating the the the the the the are suck
[44:35] in the pedal when it used to be made of
[44:37] rubber don't know what they're made of
[44:38] today I could H you but anyway you know
[44:41] now what was it what science could
[44:44] explain that to that little boy right
[44:46] see you know he didn't go to the doctor
[44:48] and say oh I know what's wrong with you
[44:50] son go and start licking the pedal of
[44:51] your basic go that'll swort you out you
[44:54] think oh that's a quack doctor you know
[44:56] but you see that little boy there was
[44:59] something in him he couldn't explain it
[45:02] the doctor couldn't explain it but then
[45:04] when they found out that he was lacking
[45:05] in that vitamin D or whatever it was
[45:08] that's what was in the Rubber and that's
[45:09] what his little body was so that's how
[45:11] the circle works that's how it works
[45:13] hallelujah amen and it's wonderful
[45:15] praise the Lord and uh so it had to be
[45:18] there you've got to need this morning it
[45:21] has to be met you desire to go to that
[45:23] City there has to be a city to go to it
[45:26] has to be that way there's a deep
[45:27] calling onto a deep and it doesn't
[45:30] matter what the President says or
[45:31] doesn't say we're past that Hallelujah
[45:34] you know I'm sorry just to use this this
[45:36] expression but if I was in a restaurant
[45:39] and and maybe Michael Jordan I think
[45:41] it's basketball that to tell me anyway
[45:42] is basketball I great you know if he
[45:45] comes in and says do you know who I am
[45:47] well I wouldn't know who he is and Not
[45:50] only would I not know who he is I
[45:52] wouldn't care less who he is you see do
[45:55] you know who who I am I'd say to him do
[45:57] you know who I am hallelujah amen so and
[46:01] that's only an illustration there plenty
[46:03] of other illustrations there you know
[46:04] but that that deep calling on to a deep
[46:07] amen now and the thing is folks that man
[46:12] actually wants Oneness with God he
[46:15] really does Hallelujah with his creator
[46:18] with his maker it's deep in the psychic
[46:20] of man that's his desire and it
[46:23] certainly is and that's why they when
[46:25] they talk about uh you know making man
[46:28] God but you see it's still if you boil
[46:31] it down it's the same idea to to be God
[46:34] you see amen that's deep in the psychic
[46:36] amen and and amen it's the desire of
[46:39] every True Believer and and the hemorr
[46:41] or certainly got it right when he said
[46:43] my goal is God himself you know if you

[1:05:43] we've got this anointing in us
[1:05:44] hallelujah that we are one with God
[1:05:47] because his word is in us and that's
[1:05:49] what the scripture says that's what the
[1:05:51] prophet's telling us we know it to be
[1:05:52] true and it's an anointing word am
[1:05:55] that's the key hallelujah we're not
[1:05:57] wling about there in some Lutheran
[1:05:59] church this morning as dead as a door
[1:06:01] Neil Hallelujah we are one with the word
[1:06:04] the anointed word is in us this
[1:06:07] morning amen he said this is Oneness
[1:06:11] with God see the Oneness of God is the
[1:06:13] word anointed in you see and when you
[1:06:16] become a son a messiah a messiah of the
[1:06:19] age Imagine amen you're gods and who the
[1:06:22] who the word of God came to we I'm mat
[1:06:24] your Gods
[1:06:26] folks Hallelujah we knew who we are
[1:06:29] praise
[1:06:30] God
[1:06:31] Amen yeah Hallelujah and so of the age
[1:06:36] the anointed in our age every one of us
[1:06:38] could tell us yes brother Bram preach
[1:06:40] the the false anointed ones at the end
[1:06:42] time which is perfectly correct it's a
[1:06:44] real anointing brother you know it but
[1:06:46] Samuel hallelujah amen The Vessel
[1:06:49] themselves is not right amen but it's
[1:06:52] like the rain that falls on everybody
[1:06:54] praise God if you're in the meeting
[1:06:55] it'll fall on you that don't mean
[1:06:57] nothing Hallelujah it don't mean nothing
[1:07:00] amen see but we're talking about not the
[1:07:02] false anointed ones but we're talking
[1:07:04] about the true anointed ones that has
[1:07:06] the word of God in them amen amen see
[1:07:10] because Judas sat sat through it we were
[1:07:12] talking about it yesterday he sat
[1:07:13] through all the messages saw all the
[1:07:15] Miracles and actually did them himself
[1:07:17] when they went he of the sick cast out
[1:07:19] devils and and no doubt old Judas was
[1:07:21] going bubbling too oh wonderful Wonder
[1:07:24] you know but he couldn't come to the
[1:07:26] Holy Ghost he couldn't receive that new
[1:07:29] birth he couldn't receive it because he
[1:07:31] was a son of predition yes sir okay I
[1:07:34] might get a little quote on that praise
[1:07:36] the Lord amen so that's what we are
[1:07:38] today that word anointed in us the
[1:07:40] allotted word for our age that's the
[1:07:44] most important where we see ourselves
[1:07:47] like like Samuel was saying uh
[1:07:49] Revelation is our book Hallelujah
[1:07:51] they're telling me that the Catholics
[1:07:53] are trying their next Edition they're
[1:07:54] trying to get the Book of Revelation out
[1:07:57] they don't like it probably they see
[1:08:00] themselves there in Revelation 17 that's
[1:08:02] probably why they don't like
[1:08:03] it amen praise God so amen and and and
[1:08:08] so hallelujah what kind of Oneness no
[1:08:11] the elot word for our age the age of the
[1:08:14] Overcomer right my when I look at people
[1:08:17] this morning to see that you are an
[1:08:19] overcomer that's what you were born for
[1:08:22] you were born to overcome Hallelujah you
[1:08:24] don't have to worry about nothing that's
[1:08:26] the way you were born and when you
[1:08:28] received that word God has been anointed
[1:08:30] that word in you ever since Hallelujah
[1:08:34] and you're a messiah of the age you
[1:08:35] might realize it like my sister she
[1:08:37] might realize she the strength put you
[1:08:39] heart to get the 80 years of age
[1:08:41] Hallelujah and so what kind of Oneness
[1:08:44] amen the bright age that's the anointed
[1:08:47] word in us today this morning and I'm
[1:08:49] not a b ashamed of that and I'll tell

[1:08:53] of brother Bram
[1:08:54] hallelujah praise God to give them the
[1:08:57] place where God placed them as a prophet
[1:08:59] of our day when we were up talking to
[1:09:01] the the brothers in uh in Laos and I got
[1:09:04] my turn and I just felt to say to them
[1:09:06] why did God have to send Elijah what
[1:09:08] does it mean and we went right through a
[1:09:10] whole series like that with him to show
[1:09:13] why God had to send allei because he
[1:09:14] said he would destroy the world if if if
[1:09:17] allei didn't come but Elijah did come
[1:09:19] and he came to restore that's what he
[1:09:22] came to do and that's what he did
[1:09:24] right amen amen well if the Baptists
[1:09:27] don't agree with it then they haven't
[1:09:28] got the same anointing as I have right

[1:09:34] thinking about that uh we are not we are
[1:09:36] not uh talking about the oness

[1:16:11] when you talk about the stature of a
[1:16:12] perfect man I at back home praise the
[1:16:15] Lord that we were thinking about the
[1:16:19] seed on the path or the trail of The
[1:16:21] Serpent and that's why thing a lot of
[1:16:23] people will emphasize that they'll
[1:16:25] emphasize the trail of The Serpent and

[1:16:29] can follow it through Kean right on down
[1:16:32] H amen and uh right in the Nimrod my B

[1:16:58] seven Church ages all through the seven
[1:17:01] Church ages there's only had been two
[1:17:02] seeds I listened to it yesterday in the
[1:17:04] record amen see the seed of the serpent
[1:17:07] that came down by K nourished by
[1:17:09] doctrines and Creeds but what about the
[1:17:12] seed of the woman and you can come right
[1:17:14] through to see that seed of the serpent
[1:17:16] as a thought then that that Bishop comes
[1:17:19] over from Babylon right into what thara
[1:17:22] whatever whatever it was
[1:17:23] and you know the Catholic church has it
[1:17:25] it was born in Babylon I tell you one
[1:17:28] thing folks if you could have heard a
[1:17:29] message by Nimrod and heard a message by
[1:17:32] by the present Pope you wouldn't know
[1:17:34] the difference they're preaching a
[1:17:37] bloodless religion oh my that's what
[1:17:40] they're preaching there's no blood
[1:17:42] religion in the Catholic church it's a
[1:17:44] bloodless sacrifice well you how do you
[1:17:46] do that uhuh how do you do that okay so
[1:17:50] and then when you go right on through
[1:17:52] the right up to to the end it becomes
[1:17:54] what the Beast then the Antichrist
[1:17:57] that's that group but what about the
[1:17:59] seed of the woman hallelujah what about
[1:18:02] that seed amen that came through Seth
[1:18:04] amen then came through Enoch Hallelujah
[1:18:07] who walked with God and was not because
[1:18:09] God took him amen then Noah himself
[1:18:13] following on the seed of God Amen coming
[1:18:16] right through and ham sham and jao and
[1:18:19] then right in to Seth and right on
[1:18:22] through amen and to Abraham Hallelujah
[1:18:26] see you can talk about the seed of the
[1:18:28] woman the seed of the serpent but here's
[1:18:30] the seed of the woman coming right
[1:18:31] through and he tried to destroy it so
[1:18:34] many times but he cannot see you can
[1:18:39] stand up this morning or this evening or
[1:18:41] anytime you want to and you can quote to
[1:18:43] the devil hurt not the oil or the wine
[1:18:48] he cannot do it you can challenge him
[1:18:51] anytime you want he cannot hurt the oil
[1:18:55] or he cannot hurt the wine the
[1:18:57] Revelation on the Holy Ghost cannot hurt
[1:18:59] it amen and you can come right on
[1:19:02] through praise the Lord King David King
[1:19:04] Solomon right on down through until the
[1:19:06] day that maray brought that little child
[1:19:09] and give it in the hands of Simeon and
[1:19:11] Simeon could have said as easy as he
[1:19:13] could have said anything behold the seed
[1:19:17] of the woman and he shall bruise that
[1:19:21] Serpent's head Hallelujah HJ praise God
[1:19:25] I think they would find it hard sitting
[1:19:26] through a meeting like this you know

[1:19:30] very comfortable amen I put it that way
[1:19:32] okay and I'm glad I don't want them here

[1:35:34] I'll hear Larn over the email or
[1:35:36] something that that there was a woman
[1:35:38] that had TB and she went back and she
[1:35:40] got the x-rays after prayer and and it's

[1:36:03] United to him and in this prayer of
[1:36:05] Jesus our high priest it has to be
[1:36:11] answered because he pray it that's right

[1:36:28] into the godhead we we certainly don't
[1:36:30] believe in no Trinity amen but what I
[1:36:33] would like just to say in the closing up
[1:36:34] of of the message amen that in the book
[1:36:38] of Philippines amen where we read amen
[1:36:41] that I and the father are one praise the
[1:36:43] Lord and here he was he took the form of
[1:36:46] a servant he could do that Hallelujah he
[1:36:49] humbled himself even to the death of the
[1:36:51] Cross wherefore God has highly exalted
[1:36:54] him that at his name every knee shall
[1:36:57] bow everyone and glory and Heaven and
[1:36:59] Earth amen and as I said nothing in that
[1:37:02] passage teaches the Eternal Word emptied
[1:37:04] himself of his divine nature or his
[1:37:07] attributes cuz he proved that he proved
[1:37:09] who he was Hallelujah you know if it had
[1:37:11] have been 10,000 people at that Seaside
[1:37:13] that day he would have fed them everyone
[1:37:15] right would it been anything to him and
[1:37:18] that's what people say that they always
[1:37:19] talk about the historical Jesus the
[1:37:21] hisorical Jesus you know that was the
[1:37:23] word made and flesh standing there and
[1:37:25] he could do it Hallelujah cook food

[1:37:57] a good thing isn't it Hallelujah you're
[1:37:59] brother Bram in this message when he was
[1:38:01] preaching the spirit that you've got
[1:38:03] agrees with the word and that's never

[1:38:18] problem with that at all none whatsoever

[1:42:35] Hebrews this morning and I just want to
[1:42:37] read this of a May if you just give me
[1:42:39] two more moments he said he PID a debt
[1:42:41] of sin now in order to get Oneness
[1:42:43] between God and man Jesus could not do
[1:42:46] it as long as he was here in a body of
[1:42:49] Flesh so he had to become the complete
[1:42:53] sin offering to take away the guilt of
[1:42:56] the believer so we ain't got no guilt is
[1:42:59] that right hallelujah amen amen we ain't
[1:43:01] got no guilt so praise the Lord and he
[1:43:03] says so that the Holy Ghost could come
[1:43:07] into mine and make mine and God oness
[1:43:11] again see there had to be something to
[1:43:15] reestablish see when we see this the
[1:43:18] penalty must be paid and know the
[1:43:21] highest form of animal life is a human
[1:43:24] being and the human being fail itself so
[1:43:27] how could one human save another it
[1:43:29] taking God and God is a spirit but could
[1:43:33] not die so God had to bring himself a
[1:43:36] little lower than the Angels Hebrews
[1:43:38] chapter 1 that's why we read it amen had
[1:43:41] to do it himself lower than the angels
[1:43:44] in order to take death to pay the
[1:43:46] penalty to bring the Oneness between God
[1:43:50] and my and I can tell you this morning
