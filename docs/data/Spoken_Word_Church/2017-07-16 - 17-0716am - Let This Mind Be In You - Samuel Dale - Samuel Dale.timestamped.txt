[7:39] meetings and things where they bring in
[7:41] a lot of the missionaries come in and
[7:43] have them count meeting tonight we just
[7:45] basically schedule services because that
[7:48] way we get to bring in these brothers
[7:50] and let a minister to you and you know
[7:53] to do and helping had to have some back
[7:56] that have been away and it's heard our

[8:12] just pray and go right into the word of
[8:14] the Lord father we thank you for an
[8:17] opportunity of gathering today and we
[8:19] thank you for your love in your grace
[8:21] and your guidance and to us
[8:23] thank you for Calvary because that's the
[8:27] main part of our lives and we thank you
[8:28] for all of these things we ask you now
[8:31] that you would just come and be among us
[8:33] not as an recorder of our actions and
[8:36] lives and thoughts but yet that you
[8:38] would speak to us by your love in your
[8:41] grace because it's my we've gathered to
[8:43] hear and truly we believe faith comes by
[8:46] hearing and hearing by the word of the
[8:48] Lord so we ask you to just have your way
[8:50] bless and guide each one in order to
[8:53] forgive our sins because we want to stay
[8:55] clean in you and just have your way open
[8:58] the eyes of our understanding to thy
[9:00] word that we may walk therein we love
[9:03] you and we thank you in Jesus name
[9:08] Philippians 2 if there be therefore any
[9:14] consolation in Christ if any comfort of
[9:19] love if any fellowship of the Spirit if
[9:21] any bowels of Mercy enough there be any
[9:24] of these fulfill you my joy that you be
[9:28] like-minded and once like-minded having
[9:32] the same love being of one Accord of one
[9:35] mind okay let nothing be done through
[9:39] strife or vainglory but in lowliness of
[9:42] mind let each esteem other better than
[9:47] themselves look not every man on his own
[9:50] things but every man also on the things
[9:53] of others let this mind I notice mine
[9:57] mine mine - keeps constantly stating it
[10:01] let this mind be in you which was also
[10:04] in Christ Jesus
[10:06] now what did it do what it was in Christ
[10:08] Jesus who being in the form of God
[10:11] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[10:15] God but made himself of no reputation
[10:17] and took upon him the form of a servant
[10:20] and was made in the
[10:22] - of men and being found in fashion as a
[10:24] man he humbled himself and became
[10:26] obedient unto death even the death of
[10:30] the cross now look what the mind of
[10:31] Christ caused to happen to Jesus Christ
[10:35] so what was do we expect it for
[10:37] ourselves
[10:38] alright wherefore God has highly exalted
[10:41] him and given him a name which is above
[10:44] every name that at the name of Jesus
[10:47] every knee shall should bow of things in
[10:50] heaven and things in earth and things
[10:53] under the earth and we'll do the life
[10:56] partner and that ever tongue should
[10:58] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the
[11:01] glory of God the Father and then you may
[11:04] be seated the Lord that is blessing to
[11:06] the reading of the word now we've been
[11:10] talking lately about to the church and
[11:18] trying to bring out a few things of
[11:21] understanding and trying to see and
[11:25] comprehend God in his ways because
[11:28] that's what we're supposed to be doing
[11:30] you know we come to church to learn of
[11:34] God what is the purpose of coming we
[11:36] come to see each other well we got
[11:38] houses to do that in we come to do this
[11:40] we can go down to Walmart and see each
[11:41] other because 90 times you're going to
[11:44] see 90% of people in one Walmart
[11:46] somewhere across the United States they
[11:48] ever close them out it's going to be bad
[11:50] because it won't be nowhere to go but
[11:52] everybody runs to Walmart to visit but
[11:55] yet see we we are talking about the mind
[12:00] of God what about your God is your God
[12:02] real that's the question I've asked is
[12:04] he just a myth or is he a thought is he
[12:08] some idea that you have um you know you
[12:12] have the groups that believe that the
[12:15] good thoughts of mankind is God and the
[12:18] bad thoughts is the devil well let's
[12:20] just put you in a mind of thought but
[12:23] that will not clear up and give to me
[12:26] the understanding that I believe because
[12:28] the Bible speaks constantly of the mind
[12:31] of God well wouldn't it be nice to have
[12:35] mind of God then why not why couldn't we
[12:42] have the mind of God because on
[12:47] Corinthians 2 and 16 1st Corinthians he
[12:51] says we have the mind of Christ the ever
[12:55] born again believer now the mind is not
[12:58] this part of year we think this is mine
[13:00] we think this is called brain you know
[13:03] the mass we think that is the mind that
[13:06] the Bible is speaking of course it let
[13:08] this mind be in you alright we don't
[13:11] believe in taking a brain transplant
[13:13] right they say that will never be done I
[13:17] hope they don't I hope they do one of
[13:20] these days that I can get one it I can
[13:22] think better maybe but the mind see is
[13:25] the part of you that's doing that
[13:27] thinking right now and considering
[13:30] things and even your eyes doesn't work
[13:32] without your mind everything works from
[13:34] the mind but that's just your mechanical
[13:37] brain it's causing you to do things your
[13:41] mind is really what you are you know you
[13:46] are you what you're thinking your
[13:48] thinking is your mind that's you that's
[13:50] the part within you that's doing the
[13:52] thinking all right and see in that we
[13:55] know by having the new birth as we
[13:58] called it the born-again experience that
[14:01] Paul would be saying in the right order
[14:04] that the life that I now live after he's
[14:07] born again I live by the faith of the
[14:10] Son of God well then that way that is
[14:13] bringing into as he's talking about the
[14:16] mind as we read here let this mind that
[14:19] was in Christ being you well if that's
[14:23] not meaning in other words if the Bible
[14:26] means anything is telling you to let
[14:29] that happen or life is telling you to
[14:31] let that happen
[14:32] it means it can happen or else why would
[14:35] you say let this mind that was in Christ
[14:37] being you all right see then the mind is
[14:40] the part of you the thinking mechanism
[14:43] that causes it and that's what keeps you
[14:46] alive while you're asleep and all of the
[14:49] things through all of the great way that
[14:52] God made us to operate all right but I
[14:56] want the mind of Christ don't you well
[15:00] then we can have that mind of Christ by
[15:02] the new birth by born-again experience
[15:04] by accepting Jesus Christ as our Savior
[15:06] dying to ourselves and accepting him and
[15:10] believing his word then see he can give
[15:13] us a part of his own life which is not
[15:16] in this brain I wish that there was a
[15:19] way like I said I'm truthful that if
[15:23] they could take my brain and take it out
[15:25] and throw away the things I don't like
[15:27] and leave me the parts that are good I
[15:30] would be glad to do that because you
[15:34] know that would be our i but that
[15:36] wouldn't be it because if something else
[15:38] is motivating that something within us
[15:42] which is deeper than just our thinking
[15:45] just as our brain is recalled see then
[15:48] the mind as Paul was saying let this
[15:50] mind be in you and he said if that mind
[15:53] is in you what are you going to be over
[15:55] in the Corinthians you're going to be a
[15:56] new creature a new creation in Christ
[16:00] Jesus honor by accepting Jesus Christ as
[16:04] your Savior then he can come in and live
[16:06] in you and coming back out of you then
[16:10] would that not be the mind of Christ
[16:13] would that not be the new birth as we
[16:16] call it the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[16:19] whatever terminologies salvation
[16:22] whatever terminologies or words you'd
[16:24] like to be using see then you could
[16:27] understand that the Bible is really in
[16:30] simplicity explaining the fact that you
[16:34] and I need a new birth that's why
[16:37] Nicodemus see the first message Jesus
[16:40] preached in the world was what to
[16:43] Nicodemus right the first sermon the
[16:46] Lord Jesus preached was the nicotine
[16:48] what do you say you must be born again
[16:51] now Nicodemus couldn't understand that
[16:54] because he first he thought oh I got to
[16:57] go back to my mother and be born again
[16:59] he said
[17:01] you know he thought that was the way he
[17:02] was speaking and Jesus said if I explain
[17:06] earthly things to Europe you can't
[17:08] understand my simple language of saying
[17:10] you're surely not going to understand
[17:12] heavenly things but he was simply
[17:15] speaking of the fact that on the day of
[17:19] Pentecost in the Bible those disciples
[17:23] went to the upper room and they dwelled
[17:26] in that upper room and when they did the
[17:27] Holy Ghost fell upon them over there in
[17:30] the book of Acts and they came forth as
[17:33] new creatures in Christ Jesus having the
[17:39] mind of God now come on get what I'm
[17:45] saying having the mind of God not a
[17:46] brain transplant they wouldn't want it
[17:50] was that brain is just something that's
[17:54] transmitted it doesn't even do it see
[18:00] you don't see with your eyes you see
[18:04] from your heart as the Bible calls it
[18:06] the heart is the center of man are the
[18:09] mind of God
[18:10] or the mind for the person so that mind
[18:13] of trying to get your thoughts that
[18:14] looking at the mind see then you can see
[18:21] by God coming and living in you by the
[18:24] new birth then he can give you his own
[18:30] mind then Paul said it's not I live with
[18:34] the Christ that liveth in me the life
[18:37] that I now live in the flesh I live by
[18:38] the faith of the Son of God what about a
[18:42] great mind of great things at all of
[18:45] this world you've got all of the people
[18:47] of the world all the minds you've got
[18:50] all of them you know the Einsteins and
[18:53] the great brains of the world but where
[18:56] do they get their thinking from you got
[18:59] great brains of people in all of these
[19:02] countries you know that that are real
[19:04] very intelligent until it's almost um
[19:09] it's almost impossible for not do just
[19:13] about anything today
[19:14] can travel through outer space they can
[19:17] do all kind of things they can move
[19:20] objects they can do everything because
[19:24] that there is a god right okay so you
[19:30] say well I don't believe in God well
[19:31] then you're believing you're the god
[19:33] then you said well you're just crazy to
[19:37] believe in God well I don't want to
[19:40] believe in you and see if you can tell
[19:43] me there is no God you're greater than
[19:46] he is right so I certainly don't want to
[19:50] listen to you to think about you being
[19:52] God be that way I believe in the fact
[19:56] that God can give mankind he's wrong
[20:03] thinking it can give mankind his own
[20:11] word he can deliver and give
[20:16] understanding to us of all of the things
[20:19] that we have need of because he can give
[20:24] us his mind
[20:26] you can change our way of thinking is
[20:29] that a better way of saying it it can
[20:32] cause us to stop thinking wrong and
[20:34] start thinking right why because it
[20:37] works from the inside that's where most
[20:40] people have salvation as an outward
[20:42] experience they go to church they do
[20:45] this they pay tithe they they do this
[20:47] they do that they dress the clothes they
[20:49] do all kind of things they do everything
[20:52] to try to show where they are but then
[20:54] they don't really see Jesus Christ well
[20:59] why not I thought the whole purpose of
[21:03] mankind was to the fact that God could
[21:08] come and dwell with us and then take us
[21:14] to where he is
[21:16] I thought that was the goal of all
[21:19] mankind I thought everybody whether you
[21:21] believe your God is Buddha into Muslims
[21:24] whatever you think it is a totem pole or
[21:26] or any kind of a God why would you
[21:32] believe in a god if you're not going to
[21:33] believe that there's things for here
[21:35] after the old Indian with a happy
[21:37] hunting-grounds and the different thing
[21:39] that everybody's always believed in some
[21:41] other way you know of something after
[21:46] this world because I guess we finally
[21:49] figured it out we're all dying you know
[21:53] when you look at these young kids and
[21:55] boy they're happy they're joyous they're
[21:57] they're doing I mean they got the
[21:59] energies and and they're running and all
[22:01] like that but just give them a little
[22:03] time and they'll start feeling old the
[22:10] more time older you feel you know why
[22:13] because you're going to the grave well
[22:16] is that all a lot to just come into the
[22:22] world and live and be good even and do
[22:24] good is that all there is to it
[22:26] is there something beyond this world is
[22:30] there a life Hereafter and if there is
[22:33] not a lot Hereafter what good is alive
[22:36] we're living through if there's not
[22:41] something you're after why would we
[22:43] worry about what we're doing now and see
[22:49] what I'm trying to get you to see is
[22:51] what we need is we need to get born
[22:57] again and let that mind start working
[23:02] not up here and let it come in here and
[23:07] start controlling from the inside and
[23:12] then we find out the mind of crisis very
[23:15] simple then is to accept Jesus Christ
[23:20] the fact that what he done for us
[23:21] because if we believe in a god that's to
[23:26] you now that's not to me if we believe
[23:28] in a God surely what would be the
[23:30] purpose what would be our thoughts about
[23:33] God well I believe in Jesus I believe he
[23:39] exists amen
[23:41] what do you believe that Jesus was
[23:43] Almighty God now in the world today see
[23:48] most of the religious realm believe that
[23:50] Jesus was a second person or a third
[23:52] person where would you get that in the
[23:54] Bible there's no such thing in the Word
[23:57] of God
[23:59] jesus said unless you believe that I am
[24:01] he now is that scripture that unless you
[24:06] believe that I am he you will die in
[24:09] your sin come on
[24:13] the Bible says there is no other name
[24:15] under heaven given whereby men must be
[24:20] saved except in the name of Jesus Christ
[24:25] why wouldn't we want the opportunity to
[24:31] be able to accept Christ as our Savior
[24:33] why would we not desire to want to know
[24:37] about God I mean from a child I've
[24:40] always had that desire always had to
[24:44] desire me from a childhood to want to
[24:47] know about God let me know I'm not
[24:52] saying I was a goody-goody good little
[24:54] boy I ain't saying that I was just like
[24:56] the rest of you all right but yet it was
[25:01] the desire in my heart to want to know
[25:04] about God and in doing that I believe
[25:12] that brings him to us
[25:18] if you'd want to know about God why
[25:20] would he not come to you why would you
[25:24] not come to you when he wouldn't come to
[25:25] somebody else it didn't want nobody
[25:27] right to our desires of ourselves
[25:33] through our mind our being of what we
[25:36] are has a lot to do with the salvation
[25:41] to be given unto us why would we not
[25:50] desire to know more about God why would
[25:56] we not desire to want to know his name
[25:59] why would we not desire to want to know
[26:02] how really is or is your God just a myth
[26:09] or a thought or a spirit as we'll go by
[26:12] in the spirit of the scriptural say you
[26:14] know God is a spirit amen I agree with
[26:16] that but then it says he's a being then
[26:21] I go without Jesus have you seen me you
[26:24] saying about you see the Bible gives a
[26:27] correct answer to our thinking if we'll
[26:30] just open her eyes to listen because he
[26:35] made away why would he create us doesn't
[26:40] remember what we read there you go from
[26:44] Philippians to Colossians and read them
[26:46] together and you'll find that God has
[26:49] always wanted to dwell with us and to do
[26:52] and what was done through Jesus Christ
[26:55] was an example of what he wants us to be
[27:00] though we read there in the scripture
[27:02] that then put as I said put it with
[27:04] caution being in the form of God for
[27:10] means the word in Moorthy is where it's
[27:13] coming from the word form in which means
[27:16] to change or to bring something from
[27:19] part that you can't see bring it into
[27:23] the open to where you can see it was not
[27:27] that what Jesus Christ did not he come
[27:29] to reveal God
[27:31] did he not come to make known God to
[27:34] mankind we see then why wouldn't that
[27:39] want to be our desire you mean you have
[27:45] a salvation if you don't want to give to
[27:47] somebody else I've always told you that
[27:50] the day God gave me salvation I tried to
[27:53] give it away
[27:55] what about you you understand what I
[27:58] mean by that I I no wonder I don't want
[28:01] to give it away that I don't have it no
[28:03] I don't mean it that way I mean what I'm
[28:06] going to do I want you to have the
[28:07] salvation I have so don't worry about
[28:10] giving it out you're not going to run
[28:11] out of it what a little bit God has
[28:15] given me if I give it to somebody it
[28:17] angled to hinder him he can do what he
[28:19] still to his work you see let the mind
[28:23] that was in Christ the Christianity is
[28:30] not just a change of thought you know
[28:35] you go to church and you get in a new
[28:37] group then you go from that group to
[28:39] another group in this group to that
[28:40] group and there was this religion to
[28:42] that religion because you're just trying
[28:45] to find some thought that you can
[28:47] associate with no I'm talking about a
[28:51] living reality I'm talking about a point
[28:57] to work that there's not a question as
[29:00] to whether or not God is real did we
[29:08] talk about it you know the theories and
[29:10] ideas of mankind how that could always
[29:12] say you know that that they say well we
[29:15] were just a Polliwog and we laid over on
[29:17] one side and grow the leg you know and
[29:19] then through millions of years you v
[29:21] over on the other side and grew another
[29:23] leg and well you know I've always said
[29:27] on the theory of evolution talking to
[29:30] somebody just the other day about it why
[29:32] is it that there had been any changing
[29:34] in the last hundred years or 200 years
[29:36] or 500 years or thousand years
[29:40] basically you look the same
[29:42] as they did 2,000 years ago right 5,000
[29:47] years ago we have a chain when growing
[29:50] new legs and growing on new parts we'll
[29:56] see that makes the theory silly because
[29:59] God created man the way he wanted him
[30:03] but he gave man everybody sitting here
[30:07] today has one thing that is a valuable
[30:11] part of your life and that's your mind
[30:19] the inward part I hope you have
[30:21] following me down to where am i the
[30:23] inward part of you is your mind not is
[30:25] that brain that's matter the Bible says
[30:29] as a man thinketh in his heart
[30:33] well now you don't think with it
[30:35] something is heard come on you know what
[30:37] I mean
[30:38] something gizzard is a flexible part
[30:40] called a heart you don't think with the
[30:43] heart you think with the center part of
[30:47] you which is the real you your soul your
[30:52] being what you are that's what's causing
[30:56] you to think that's why the animal the
[30:59] he has all the parts that we have right
[31:03] the dog a cat they have the parts we
[31:05] have but they cannot now they can work
[31:08] to a certain degree and you can train
[31:10] them you can make them talk and but yet
[31:12] no it's not to make them any different
[31:15] they're an animal the human was made on
[31:20] a higher form but it is made in the
[31:22] image of God he was given a soul a part
[31:27] of you everybody sitting here today has
[31:30] that part of you that if you allow it it
[31:34] can lead you to God but if you don't
[31:39] allow it it'll lead you straight out
[31:41] into the world and the things of the
[31:43] world
[31:44] because that's just normal doing why
[31:48] don't you listen to that inward part of
[31:50] you talking sometimes in learners I've
[31:55] always told you we do a lot of pray and
[31:57] that's wonderful it's great to pray
[31:59] that's wonderful we should pray
[32:01] the Bible says pray without ceasing but
[32:04] now that doesn't mean that we go in a
[32:06] corner somewhere shut down and don't
[32:07] never do nothing but pray how do you
[32:10] pray without ceasing you keep your mind
[32:12] on God in a powerful attitude of your
[32:18] mind desiring to serve Him and that way
[32:21] you can pray without ceasing but you
[32:23] know what we do a lot of times we do too
[32:25] much talking with the mouth we need to
[32:28] shut up sit down and listen to see what
[32:30] God wants to tell us my prayer was me
[32:35] praying to him you might find out he
[32:38] wants to talk to you you mean God wants
[32:43] to talk to me you know the reason he
[32:45] don't talk to us because we don't answer
[32:47] the telephone you understand what I mean
[32:51] we've been without a telephone down our
[32:54] home phone for a month and then I said
[32:57] would be another month because everybody
[32:59] around there there's something happening
[33:00] they've just gone crazy and they don't
[33:04] know when they're going to get them
[33:05] fixed well you know what it's all
[33:08] crossed up messed up but you know
[33:10] eventually if they ever do get it back
[33:11] it'll talk and work why because it was
[33:14] made for that and God made you and I to
[33:18] be able to talk to us about that what's
[33:24] your purpose for being here what is life
[33:25] of man and what do you do it is for God
[33:29] to talk to you he wants to talk to us he
[33:35] wants to fellowship with us but we don't
[33:38] want to fellowship with him and he gave
[33:42] us the ability to contact him we used to
[33:49] when we first got a telephone in the
[33:51] Guild's valaria you know that's kind of
[33:54] backward woods country anyway
[33:57] but when we first got a telephone we and
[33:59] I know daughter you are not old enough
[34:00] team understand it and you wouldn't your
[34:02] life is it's all about we had eight
[34:05] people on one party line that's all we
[34:08] could get we could not get anything else
[34:11] we had eight people we you never picked
[34:14] up the phone that somebody wasn't on it
[34:16] because every one of them was connected
[34:19] together
[34:22] whoever 1:00 in the morning you might be
[34:24] able to pick up the phone and be able to
[34:26] call somebody because there was eight
[34:28] people with no way to get any other
[34:30] phone my point is what the line was
[34:33] always busy I kept picking up the phone
[34:38] one night and this boy and this girl was
[34:40] talking and they were just talking you
[34:42] know and they'd come and they will you
[34:45] say something i said something lies and
[34:46] you said i wouldn't put up with about an
[34:48] hour and finally i said hey boy it got
[34:53] real quiet I said son would you allow me
[34:58] to use the phone for just a minute then
[35:01] I said then when I get through you can
[35:04] call that girl and talk to her all night
[35:05] and tell her how much you love her and
[35:07] everything we know what a second I had
[35:10] to follow because they knew you know hey
[35:17] it wouldn't be easy it was open but you
[35:20] know God's never busy he talks to you
[35:26] and you don't realize it you realize he
[35:31] fellowships with you every day and
[35:33] you're thinking and you don't pay him no
[35:36] attention
[35:36] I never heard God talking to me you know
[35:42] why cause you're blabbering all the time
[35:46] don't you think you got it figured out
[35:48] and you're running the show and you're
[35:50] not doing it
[35:50] why don't you shut up and sit down to
[35:52] listen to him talk sometime you might
[35:57] find out he's real you might find out he
[36:00] can call ya but I just don't believe God
[36:04] talk to people the more where'd you get
[36:06] that idea from
[36:08] you never got it out of the Bible joy to
[36:13] be in the Bible that he don't want to
[36:14] talk to you I'll show you now where he
[36:17] wants to talk to you but it's the wrong
[36:20] way you get over the songs like we were
[36:22] the other day where he says my thoughts
[36:24] are not your thoughts that my ways are
[36:29] not your ways that my thoughts are so
[36:33] much higher than your thoughts until
[36:35] your thoughts are not even in the
[36:36] picture see that's what we want we want
[36:38] our thoughts to try to transmit to God
[36:40] to make him be what we wanted to be
[36:44] until accepting what he is and how he's
[36:48] trying to publish it with us
[36:49] what was the purpose of creation of
[36:51] mankind I mean come on are we're a
[36:57] little bit above the Polliwog deal you
[36:59] know a little bit about what we don't
[37:01] believe in Bobby why we've got Chris
[37:02] well if he created us what he created
[37:04] far come on if he created you what he
[37:09] creates you for he created you for
[37:12] fellowship you don't never I know people
[37:17] don't think like crazies I do I'm glad
[37:19] of it would be a bad world but you know
[37:21] when I wake up in the middle of the
[37:22] night I'm not one that I'll get up and
[37:24] walk through the house I'm not going to
[37:27] lay there all night I can't sleep on
[37:30] Drive I counted Shiva and then we come
[37:33] up with great things you know and we say
[37:34] well now we're not supposed to count
[37:37] sheep we're supposed to talk to the
[37:38] shepherd and I've been praying for four
[37:40] hours and hadn't heard a word get up
[37:46] walk through the house change your mind
[37:48] go get you something to drink
[37:50] and sit down and say Lord why did you
[37:54] wake me did you want somebody to talk to
[38:01] you don't ever to because you want
[38:05] somebody to talk to Lord he said you
[38:09] sound like that to God you believe in is
[38:11] real that's what I'm trying to get you
[38:13] to see that's exactly what I believe I
[38:16] believe that God that I believe in is
[38:18] real
[38:18] he's a lot more real than I am
[38:21] he created me so then he wants to
[38:26] fellowship with us talk to us
[38:28] communicate with us not surprised you
[38:36] know but I've never heard audible voices
[38:39] well some people hear him and some don't
[38:44] but what's the difference inaudible
[38:46] voice in an inward voice speaking to you
[38:55] he let the mind that was in Christ be in
[39:00] you we've covered it we'll make you a
[39:04] new creature a new creation it'll bring
[39:07] you to new thoughts and new ideas and in
[39:10] all new ways new life will also bring
[39:18] you to a place that you can realize how
[39:22] really is you never felt the presence of
[39:27] the Lord you've never had that contact
[39:30] maybe as other people maybe have but
[39:34] does that mean he's not real that's our
[39:41] problem we don't believe he's real like
[39:45] I said the other day then we tell our
[39:46] children about Santa Claus and they wind
[39:52] up know more about Santa Claus and they
[39:53] know about Jesus Christ of course in our
[39:57] days it was known more about Daniel
[39:59] Boone's than to know about Jesus Christ
[40:01] without energy these kids now don't food
[40:04] with Daniel Boone right and we know who
[40:08] Daniel Boone is you know hardly know who
[40:11] George Washington is but they know all
[40:14] about all of these Power Rangers and and
[40:18] great things and and all of them if you
[40:22] notice all of them is trying to deal in
[40:24] a supernatural realm well but the
[40:29] Christian wants to stay in some natural
[40:31] Ram
[40:33] when I think about him in a supernatural
[40:36] ring when I think about him as being
[40:39] real when I think about him as that he
[40:42] would like to place his mind the purpose
[40:47] of him coming was to give his life the
[40:52] purpose of Jesus Christ was to give his
[40:54] life in the Old Testament there was no
[40:58] way that that life could come and live
[41:00] in them David would cry out return unto
[41:04] me the joy of thy salvation but he
[41:07] turned right around and go to the bed
[41:09] with Bathsheba because he couldn't stay
[41:12] right he had nothing to be able to keep
[41:15] him under control he was living just in
[41:20] an animal flesh form because that's what
[41:23] we are without the new birth just
[41:26] another animal higher form yet when
[41:30] Jesus Christ came and paid the price and
[41:32] died released his life that it could
[41:35] come back upon you and I that would be
[41:38] able to give us an inward being bring us
[41:45] to an inward thoughts something that's
[41:51] real and give us his mind
[42:01] let us think histology you know we
[42:09] talked about Moses you realize that
[42:10] Moses caught the thought from God he
[42:18] went out and said let there be fleas and
[42:20] flies and frogs and cover the nation
[42:22] with him excuse me
[42:26] let the nation with his words from his
[42:29] mouth that God had spoke to his heart
[42:32] and truly we ought to be able to believe
[42:39] more than he did excuse me we ought to
[42:45] be able to think more about God and how
[42:48] real he is because there was no way that
[42:51] he could enter in to Moses the way had
[42:56] not been made he could not bring his
[43:00] mind he could enter his brain and talk
[43:03] to him but he couldn't bring his mind to
[43:05] the inward part of Moses that's why you
[43:09] didn't have the salvation back there
[43:11] like that but when Jesus Christ came he
[43:15] delivered up his own life that he could
[43:18] come back and live in you and I didn't
[43:22] truly then Paul's right he said to what
[43:24] the life that I now live I live by the
[43:29] faith why don't you try talking to God
[43:34] sometimes once you try fellowshipping
[43:35] with him you might find out he wants to
[43:39] talk to you you might find out this old
[43:42] boys not too silly to wake up in the
[43:43] middle of the night and say Lord what do
[43:45] you want you're trying to tell me
[43:47] something I've done that many times and
[43:49] there's people President didn't know
[43:53] woke up in the middle of the night and
[43:55] somebody get on my heart and I start
[43:57] praying for him come find out there's
[43:58] something going wrong somebody needed
[44:03] your priority somebody might need yours
[44:07] he said well then why don't God go ahead
[44:09] and do it why did Jesus stand there who
[44:11] was the Lord of the harvest right you
[44:13] agree he was the god of the harvest he
[44:15] said pray that the god of the harvest
[44:17] will send forth laborers and he was the
[44:22] god of the harvest what was he saying
[44:25] pray that I'll do what I said I'll do in
[44:28] the word but I'm allowing you to how
[44:29] something to do with it
[44:35] salvation is living for others it's not
[44:40] selfishness and that's like I said if
[44:45] you wait a minute you find out you get a
[44:48] good case of salvation you'll find out
[44:50] you want to give it away you understood
[44:54] what I've said in there a moment ago you
[44:56] want to give it to somebody else you
[44:58] want them to have the experience that
[45:01] you have within your hearts and don't
[45:02] worry about it you can't give it away
[45:04] you ain't going to run out don't worry
[45:09] about it
[45:10] the more you give away the more God is
[45:12] going to give to you what about it let
[45:19] the mind that was in Christ be in you
[45:24] it'll make you a new creature it'll
[45:28] bring in to you his thoughts and his
[45:31] ways and his doing and to change you
[45:34] from him to that a lot of people are
[45:41] afraid of religion because they're
[45:43] afraid it'll make them calls and do
[45:44] things what are you afraid of
[45:47] would you just get morning again forget
[45:49] the whole thing
[45:51] why aren't you afraid of God and
[45:54] religion well fanatics go crazy will
[45:58] tell me about all em out there's already
[45:59] gone crazy zit that wasn't talking about
[46:02] salvation right well we don't want to
[46:07] get too fanatical about religion why you
[46:13] mean you don't love him that much
[46:16] there's my final talk you mean you don't
[46:19] love him enough to want him to use you
[46:23] to talk to somebody else this is not all
[46:26] for the preacher to do not all for the
[46:30] Deacons to do or this isn't it out of
[46:32] the other it's for everybody you know
[46:42] pastors don't beget sheep sheep beget
[46:46] sheep right Shepherds they don't beget
[46:51] chief they just take care of the sheep
[46:53] the sheep's what to get sheep you
[46:57] understand who you have a part to do
[47:01] with it you got a job to do when you
[47:04] become a Christian whether you're male
[47:05] female child or whatever you are you
[47:09] have a mind coming in you that you want
[47:13] to tell somebody else about you want
[47:16] them to have the experience that you had
[47:21] it's what brother Dale I've just never
[47:23] had no experience like that maybe that
[47:25] much well maybe you were tried I'm silly
[47:31] kind of crazy but the Bible says try me
[47:34] that right he said see whether I'll do
[47:38] that scripture we talk about tithing or
[47:44] something like that you know what the
[47:45] Bible says try me said I'll pour out
[47:49] your windows in heaven I've told you of
[47:55] that one little point this that is I put
[47:59] this challenge before Christians ever
[48:02] since I've been ministering for almost
[48:04] 50 years now he said but I brother Dale
[48:10] I don't play tide what I want to know
[48:11] why because of all the promises that
[48:15] goes with it
[48:17] why would you want all the promise
[48:21] I've offered it to you you pay times one
[48:25] year from an honest and sincere point of
[48:29] just being right about it
[48:31] you pay your tithe one year at the end
[48:34] of that year if you're not better off
[48:37] financially than you was when you
[48:39] started come and tell me
[48:41] I'll give you ever time of it back
[48:44] I'll give you ever dime you paid the ear
[48:48] I'll give it back to you I made that
[48:52] challenge for 50 years I've never paid
[48:55] one dime because if you're honest you'll
[48:59] be even true you'll find out it'll work
[49:04] that's just being a Christian that's
[49:07] just a Christian to do that and live
[49:09] right and do right it's our obligation
[49:12] as a Christian to try to help others and
[49:16] see and do why because we have the mind
[49:20] of Christ
[49:20] come on brother hello musicians listen
[49:24] but you're saying the mind that was in
[49:31] Christ let it be in you see what it'll
[49:36] do sit down kids and just think about it
[49:41] you don't have to be odd and weird to be
[49:44] a Christian and when you tell me about
[49:49] it I'll tell you about it you young kid
[49:53] just be a Christian at schooling and
[49:55] live a Christian life and thoughts
[49:57] before others and just you know you
[49:59] don't have to be no holy possum look
[50:02] like this and walk around you know and
[50:04] everything I'll just be yourself but
[50:06] just be good and be Christians in life
[50:08] and see if they won't start coming to
[50:11] you oh yeah you think they're sniggering
[50:14] at you but you let them get in trouble
[50:16] they'll come to you because they know
[50:20] where they can find help well why
[50:24] wouldn't you want to do that why would
[50:27] you not want to be a Christian
[50:29] in every way or form you know you know
[50:36] if you get Christians you do away with
[50:38] punch in clocks and punch out clocks
[50:41] does everybody be honest they go to work
[50:44] you do away with having to hire extra
[50:47] people to run everybody else's job when
[50:49] they lay out of work if you become a
[50:51] Christian you say you mean that the
[50:54] other I swear Christian is a Christian
[50:56] is a Christian all the time because the
[51:04] mind of Christ is come in there the
[51:08] steam oh my god if you understand my
[51:13] point thinking about being in God's mind
[51:17] a part of God's mind I told you over and
[51:23] over I don't want to be just what God
[51:25] taught us that's not the part of the
[51:28] mind that I'm talking about the part I'm
[51:30] talking about is actually letting that
[51:32] mind come and live in you by the new
[51:37] birth into that soul and let him live
[51:41] out let's I never had no problems we're
[51:46] doing that we're human being job but
[51:51] never had a problem he tell you care of
[51:54] all the truffles right what would that
[51:56] go ahead
