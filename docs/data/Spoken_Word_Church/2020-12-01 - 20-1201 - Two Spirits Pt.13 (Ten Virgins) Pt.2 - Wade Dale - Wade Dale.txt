that can y'all hear that man somebody give you cold chills man to hear them two playing in harmony like they do goodness gracious but you know what if they use a talent for the lord that's what it's supposed to sound like amen i mean they got we got them in the world that can fiddle that thing and the strains will go to popping everywhere and they still play him but you know what hang a bit of god in them no way but thank god we've got two young ladies that have committed their life to play the instruments for the glory of the lord so if you got your bibles let's turn to first john four we're going to get into the two spirits this will be part two be part 13 10 virgins part two since we didn't get into the 10 virgins last tuesday night so uh remember the announcements that that terrence's give us just go over one more time december the 6th which will be this coming sunday brother luis will be speaking dad and i'll be in kentucky i call brother richard hyatt yesterday his wife has coveted so he'll be sitting at home with her and he said that's just the way the lord works it out he said i'd had to find somebody to preach for me and he said i already scheduled you so so it's good that we could be able to help him but i told him we would pray for his wife brother richard hyatt's wife she is was tested positive yesterday for the virus and most of his church he says already had it so i think we're okay we're okay anyway i'm not not going so decent and december the 9th which will be on the wednesday that we're starting back brother aaron will be speaking for us and then that'll be on the 13th and that'll be the christmas dinner that kind of gets us all back in line then december the 31st brother william bourdon will be here for our ever how many 50 something annual watch night service and we never had not had one heaven since 1971 never never not had one so we thank god for that that it's a long running tradition that works out really well and then the world can party all they want to but they can't they can't string together a group of spiritual people like we can and bring them together on that night to bring in a new year and now like i said wednesday i'm looking forward to this year satan has just beat us up in the flesh i just got back from the doctor today i'm having a psa test again just pray that that thing will go back down so we won't have to do anything further and i got a cortisone shot in my shoulder and give blood and i don't know what else going on so this i'll be 61 in a few months in a few months so that's all right but devil can beat all he wants to i just go back to job you can sit there and watch job job was he was an upright man and god brought the attention of job being an upright man to the devil and the devil first thing he said you've got a hedge built around him he said okay touch his body but you can't touch his life so he took everything away from him except his salvation and that's what held job to be the salvation of that time not like the salvation of our time but the salvation of his time job was a righteous man because he did what the word said amen that's what i've been thinking today too with these two spirits the difference in these two spirits is is one is a hundred percent on the word and the other is 99. just one percent off and that's what we're going to talk about tonight so 10 virgins part two but it'll be part 13 or two spirits so all mine's clear i know we all have family members and uh i just there was a text coming in from brother sister carnes about ray montgomery someone said he was doing worse but the problem was is the balloon and the ventilator broke so it made everything go haywire like he was almost dying but it's not when they put the new ventilator back on the new ventilator bulb back on his blood pressure went back up and his oxygen went up some and they got him on his back so we're just going to pray that the devil tried to do what he could do and send out false information but but when the doctors came in and put that new vent back on there it came back up they thought he had a um yes a man they thought he had a bleed in his brain did a brain scan perfect they said and they thought he had a collapsed lung so they did a lot they did there were several tests on the come in on facebook there were several tests that they had run and so everything's fine so we're just going to believe and keep believing positive that the devil can do what he wants to uh we had and communication is bad just pray for those nurses and ones because because you know dad even had gave that we got false information from from a person up there in the hospital and and you're only getting what you hear you don't get to personally talk to a doctor so and sister rita sitting at home you know she's got covid so she's doing better but she was able to talk to brother ray for a little while the other day and she was reading him scripture and reading him some of the prophet's message so just keep doing and we just keep praying to me that's the best formula amen just have positive attitude keep praying read the bible and just believe that god's already done it amen so let's bow our heads dear emily father thank you lord for getting us here today lord we've through many dangers talls and snares as this song says lord satan would love to just destroy every one of us in this building at the moment but lord your protective hand is upon each one and father we pray that you would just be with us now in the furtherment of this service that your protective hand will now as we are seating here today in heavenly places as the bible says that we'll hear from you father and not hear from just a man but we'll hear directly from you lord through the reading of the scripture and the quoting and the different things lord may we receive revelation and lord may it take us through tomorrow the next day and lord until you come father this is a self-sustaining word it absolutely will sustain you through any problem that anyone has and ever has had because you said it there for us to have it already so thank you for that father we ask you to bless now and the furthermore service be with us as we travel starting tomorrow going for a little time of rest and relaxation beaver brother richard hyatt's wife lord we pray that you touch her lord with this virus lord it would just go away real quick and you'll be back in service for you father we ask these things in jesus name amen brother richard was telling me there was a brother mead i'd never heard of him before but uh he'd be in the message a long time he he succumbed to the to the virus a couple days ago and just keep the family in your prayers so trying times but you know what it's okay we're all right we're good first john 4 verse 1 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know you the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist where we have heard that it should come and even now now already is in the world so it's been in the world now since whatever this is 1896 when john's pinning this so it's been here a while all right and it's not an infant anymore it's a full-grown man you are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world we could go home and just believe that that'd be a good good place to stop they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god here's not us hereby know we the spirit this is the question now hereby hereby we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error now let's read matthew 25 it says then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins we took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five of them were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wives took oil in their vessels with their lamps and we'll get to that in just a little bit the lord adds a blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated unless we get our let's read the two quotes that we've been reading before in the exposition of the church agency now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts now what what i've been thinking about this during this this week the whole time during the week we got to know listen as brother dale was telling us sunday these little markers and these little prophecies and these things that we have seen come to pass we know that now six of them has come to pass we're not gonna be here for number seven so where are we at we're in that catching away or we're in that interval time that overlap between this and destruction so when we look at this it says christ in the true church where's the true church you've got to decide where that true church is you've got to know where that true church is because we can't be wishy-washy and say well i'll take part of what wesley in and part of what luther and and then i'll just you know i i was talking to somebody the other day and it sounds just like the virgins you know because they try to live the best they can when you talk to a real good a nominal christian that really tries to live the best they can but folks they're so far off it's it's horrible the only word they have is what the preachers told them and what mamas told them and i was talking to somebody just a little bit ago and it's and you kind of roll your eyes because you know you know grandma's the one who said that it wasn't their revelation it's what grandma said so they just carried it right on down to the next generation and the next generation so the only thing we should be carrying down is is where that true church was right and where that true church is because it says the true church is a continuation of the book of acts the false church will look like it to a degree but it will not continue on all right now if eve would have continued on in what god told her she would have produced what god told her to produce but she didn't she stopped just like interjecting a revelation that's not true because the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it now why it's going to try to get in the true church but it's going to get in church somewhere and the true church in antioch look at that powerful group in ephesus it wasn't a church of 6 or 800 people it was 12. but they were all full of the holy ghost they all had the book of acts working or the acts of the holy ghost working in their life when they came to church they didn't have to preach salvation unless they had visitors but what did they do they preached the meat of the word they let they let paul and peter and the different ones give them the meat of the word and there's that unsung hero i was telling you about what happened to those 12 they had to go out and tell oh so there had to be a true line of a true church line l-i-n-e not lying l-i-n-e a true line because that's what we're working with now is what started back there see i just have to believe you should have to believe that if it started back there and it was a true church whatever happens between the 2000 years of church theology there's got to be a true church today just as true as that church but the thing we have that they don't have they didn't have the open book you and i have the open book you and i have the seven seals you and i have the revelations that we can that we can actually tell paul we can tell paul paul i know you saw this but this is what the reality of it is amen same way with peter and all the different ones like brother there was talking about jose and the different ones you know charis johnson in the streets you walk up to him one day and said hey buddy i drove one of them things that you i was one of them jostlers because while we've come to the place to wear what it's not a it's not a prophecy anymore that thing has become a true church there is a true church in this world somewhere we look at all the faults and sometimes we harp on all the faults but there is a true church gotta be it may be very small in minority it may be just scattered here and there but there is a true church because the prophet of god told us but watch we should not let this happen though let the antichrist spirit come into the church defile it make it lukewarm formal and powerless look at all these brothers that are leaving the message now you can be deceived for a while but let's get this clear one thing's for sure you start degrading the message of the hour and the prophet time after time after time and saying it's false you don't have the holy ghost right now i'm just sorry and then peop those people preached 40 years saying they had the holy ghost what did they do they talked to their people how to get it but now if they didn't have it and brother brown said you don't get higher than your pastor then what did he do he preached a foolish virgin doctrine to him and he just brought a bunch of foolish virgins now that's not to say that brother donnie didn't hear was sitting in one of those churches and he heard a true revelation of salvation or of the three works of grace or that or god did send a prophet he could get born again from that but he wouldn't stay in that when that guy looks at them and says this person's faults and we need to take all these pictures down and and he was a liar here and he's a liar there if you got the true holy ghost you'll leave because you won't be leaving it'll be the holy ghost is what's leaving amen you're just going to go with him all right so that's where you're true in your false church and we're talking about the wise and the foolish virgin but we'll get to that but look making it lukewarm formal and powerless now look the true church can't be that we may look like it we may look wore out we may have our feathers all knocked off but thank god an eagle and when he gets all his feathers knocked off he grows some new ones when his beak starts cracking and he starts doing that molting stage and he can't see he might get his little eagle eye skimmed over but you know what will happen another eagle will come along and you know what they'll do they'll they'll peck that scale it may not feel good brother louise when that brother's pecking on you but he's pecking you to help you and when them scales fall off there you are fresh new eagle again so that's what we're looking at what i mean about the truth there is a true church folks don't look around and say well i see all this false let's start looking for the truth let's start looking at the truth i know we've got a warning brother dale warns us the law many many times about all these different doctrines and all that is what we need to be warned but we also don't need to stay there we don't but i'm telling you don't worry about them right you and i have a job to do well dale's got a job to do he cleans out all the mess and then here we all come along and we help him we're behind him or helping him standing there with him when anything comes in what we throw up a standard there's a standard gets thrown up and that's not just us brothers it's you brothers and sisters sisters too how many of you sisters i've seen go out in the parking lot and question a preacher that preached something in this boy most people in the message don't like yet because a woman blessed god ain't supposed to do nothing but i thought a woman was church she don't have authority to speak it behind the pulpit but it don't mean she's silent and goes home and cooks and cleans and does whatever whatever she does and and don't say nothing right yeah no if she's got the holy ghost she'll help you hey man i don't know how i got off on that but i'm gonna charge you on that won't charge you for that one it exposes satan see that's our job satan has said in this kind not this i'm talking about satan has said in this message congregation folks he had to be because it wasn't that these preachers all had the holy ghost and all of a sudden they lost it and satan came in no satan was there the whole time but he was so sly he was just picking just a little at a time right just a little bit at the time it's the little foxes that spoil the vine amen so we just i'm just i'm telling you this today like i was beware because satan is not going to quit there's one thing about it he'll get employee of the month because he'll be the best adversary you'll ever have so he'll not quit but listen there's a time and a place where he is going to have to leave you alone because god promised it there's a true church that cannot be deceived and i contend this is that church not the building the people i contend there is a look it exposes satan revealing his works now where is that going to happen on a billboard somewhere we're going to do it on a talk show on television no you're going to do it right here right glory and your daily walk the greatest power that god has is to live his life through you and destroy what not destroy listen you and i can't destroy satan but we can destroy his effect we can destroy his effect listen satan even won't be destroyed i'm sorry the cortisone shot's itching but uh it's not bugs i'm okay i took a shower chop zack but you see that satan comes in and he he picks and when he picks he'll get somebody off to the side and he'll move him around and and you see you you see it but then all of a sudden everything goes quiet be careful that's when satan's really goes to digging so just be careful with that revealing his works it's going to be revealed through me and you it will not be revealed like i said this is not to the world i've got myself a note when we get to the when we get to that nice seeing council do you know at that nice in council in 606 when they ratified everything that 99 of the total christian population of the world were deceived there was only a small little bride that went through that church age right here very small and most of them got killed right went to the lion's den and all the different things fox's book of martyrs but when they had that meeting they thought they but look what did they think in that deception that we're going to read where it says what is deceived to cause to accept is true or valid what is false or invalid they walked up in 606 and said this is what god said right they didn't walk up and say this is what the devil's got for you they said this is what god's got for us and we're going to institute this forever because they're still doing it now just like we'll read here in just a minute where brother brown said that eve was deceived back there and she's still being deceived here all right and eve being what being the church all right so he exposed to satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of what god's people and the discrediting of god's word not doing away with it he's smarter than that he's just going to discredit it these people that have left the message they're not going well some listen some of them are some of them are just going out and being ranked sinners but some of them are just saying well we're just going to preach christ well that's what we're preaching to so what i don't understand you don't understand christ unless you understand this message because christ to you is the third person of a trinity if you're out there in a denominational world christ to you is something else christ to use this one over here no the true christ is the true living god that william branham preached one true and living god just like they did back in in the first part of the church ages amen so look right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it see now when he finds that at the lake of fire guess what look what satan's already been through satan's already been destroyed by me and you he will not harm now what satan got on me and you born again christians he's got this thing right but when he loses that battle when the dead and christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain will be what changed satan has lost all power on one group of people yet he still thinks he's still going to go through and think he can fight and beat somebody listen this adversary's not weak he's strong but he's only strong because we give him the power amen because remember when we get into the millennium and he has no power to work because he's got no people to work through he's still the same devil right that's right he's still the same devil right he just ain't going to have nobody to work through by a chain of circumstances not a log chain but brother runs to the chain of circumstances what there's no carnal mind there for him to work in right he knows that if a people can get the true revelation now look this is what i've been harping on all week i've been saying true revelation of the true church folks it does come down to razor's edge it does come down to a seed line that is different from all other seed lines but it is not natural it is a spiritual seed line that comes from the loins of jesus christ i mean the inner being not the man part of jesus i'm talking about the inside of the inside of jesus christ and then he speaks it and there is where me and you come from no one in this world has ever come from that right except the bride of jesus christ except 120 in the upper room when it first got started that came right out from the bowels of god and he spoke it right out and then here comes 120 little jesus then you got three thousand and and hey look nicea sure and i see a man knocked him in the head but it sure didn't kill him he didn't kill jesus people physically satan may have killed him but spiritually they were born again christians and you and i will see them there amen you and i will see them there just as real as we're standing here today more real than we're standing here today we will see them and we'll say man how'd you make it through they said it wasn't the outside guy because the outside guy would have turned away he said but it was in that inside man greater is he is in me than he that was in the world what about a testimony of of thousands dying and then they're more rough roman soldiers looking at them and going how can you do this yeah and all they do is just speak to them about well we're dying because jesus christ died on the cross and he saved our soul how many romans did did god save during that time exactly throwing their throwing their sticks down and walking right into there with them so boy to me that's to me that's a a revival you look at and say no these people getting killed no these people getting born again to me that's what revival is is people getting born again not people getting happy you can get happy and not have a revival all right so he knows that if he people gets the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits now there he's he's some he's summing it all up right here if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern now how do you discern you deserve by the word all right you don't discern by well i think boyd's looking a little no you're deserved by the spirit of god all right and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before i love that quote exposition of the church age second quote did you get it now there are these twins again there are these two trees everything's two growing side by side same earth partaking of the same nourishment see when they went to nicaea they didn't go now they didn't go and say well now we found this new thing in india that we're going to try no that was right there right they took the torah and they took the bible to whatever bible was part of it was written i know they had the old testament torah but they had all these all these different people come together and they said this is what we think this is what we think it's being said so we're just going to start baptizing it's like people say you know you say well this water baptism you know what now jesus told us i'll take what jesus said matthew whatever peter said we're not going peter was just an apostle but now we're going to tell you what jesus said they just don't know he's saying the same thing or they both were confused and god's not confused neither was peter because peter had the keys to the kingdom they seemed to forget that little point i think i love what jesus did he said now peter whatever you bind on earth i'll bind in heaven whatever you loose on earth i'll loose in heaven so what he'd done on day of pentecost he loosed the way to be baptized but man come in what tried to put it back together and do away with it what they discredited they didn't take away god's word they discredited the word of god all right now look there are two trees taking the same nourishment drinking in the same rain and benefiting by the same son but they come from different seeds one tree is for the word of god exactly as god giveth and loves it and obeys it the other tree is from the seed that is anti the word and changes it where it wants to it substitutes its own creeds and dogmas for the living true word exactly as did cain who ended up killing abel but fear not little flocks stay with the word keep that word between you and the devil eve did not do that and she failed and when the church lets down on the word she goes into the depths of the darkness of satan not that you leave church you start going to bars no you take on that dogma or that doctrine of the whatever church you want to name you can name them and we'll just we'll just say message church because that's all we're dealing with here we're not we're not dealing with the baptist and the methodist and we know what their doctrines are right but what are our doctrines right because we got to have a true doctrine we've got to be a true church with a true doctrine you got to decide that because look at the next deceived deceived deceiving means the cause to accept that's true or valid what is false or invalid matthew 6 verse 22 talking about the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine i be single the whole body shall be full of light but if thine eye be evil thou hold by evil now bro away evil then people go to church they live the best they can listen in the eyes of god it's evil i'm sorry because these foolish virgins the reason they don't make it to being bride is that somewhere they stopped and to stop is evil to stop i'll read you where brother brown said to stop they just they stopped you know why they stopped i'm gonna say this you know why they stopped because the preacher preached that they should they could stop just believe the message of the hour listen to a couple of tapes it ain't no listen i'm telling you when you get into this message and you start looking at what's going on out there it's no more than the catholic church preacher preach me a sermon pray for my kids you know give me several hail mary's tell me what to do well don't cut your hair and don't do this and do do this and well your bride because you believe the message no you're not right your bride calls you born again and that born again will take you to the message that's the formula that's the true church that's the revelation that satan hates and as soon as as soon as he got into that night seeing council he waited till william branham got here and he got into the message council and started what diluting the word convoluting diluting the word of god sending them off into all these different doctrines but if thine i be evil the whole body shall be full of darkness and if therefore that light that is in there be darkness how great is that darkness what a way to be number three we've read these before i'm going to read through them pretty quick eve actually thought she was right she was getting some new light that satan was giving her he's still giving her new light now look that ain't no light that is not light from god that is not the true light that came into the world according to john 1. no that's darkness that's why it became so dark brother branham said when the picture was drawn he said he drew it come the angel drew it completely dark in our church age he said i added a little bit of light right why it was his people it was his converts it was the message believers which is only about that much of a little sliver at the top let's read number four and studying through many books of the history of the church history's two babylons fox's book of martyrs and pre-nicene council and i see him fathers you go back and find that every spirit in the land every cult everything you go back began in genesis it come up a blooming time a blossoming time you see then them come out like cain and abel and watch those two boys come right down to judas and jesus and just right on through now watch it didn't stop with judas and jesus listen as soon as judas hung himself satan didn't go anywhere he turned around and went right back started that grievous wolves that paul was talking about and all the different things of the antichrist he started right back to work it comes right on out into this last day where the antichrist and the christ spirit so close he deceived the very elected possible now we're taught that and we know that's true now listen it took can you see why god sent up had to send us a true prophet there's been many prophets there's been many prophets even baal was a prophet bailoum i mean balaam was a prophet right but he turned out to be a false one now you don't want to run you don't want to make your church based on that that's why god had to bring us now brother brown's not our absolute but he took us to jesus christ and showed us the absolute of the word and that is our absolute we know that is what's the truth that came that christ is not the third person of the trinity that your baptism is not in titles now remember let's don't stay there though that's the foundation we got to build on up higher than that we got to go on up higher to the speaking of the word and all these different things that's that's right here at us and among us now look at number five this is what i was thinking the other day when i read this quote again now in doing this they consolidated and made the early form the early catholic church then at the first great nicene council when i read that i just fell on my knees you know what that prophet of god you know what happened he saw what was then but he saw what he was dealing with right now when he was dealing in his own time this is what he was dealing with right now it wasn't another time it was right now this is what he was dealing with he said i fell on my knees the great night seeing council take place in a.d 3 25 all of them was brought together the bishops the fathers of the christian faith was brought together at nicea the fathers of the christian faith as we said before both spirits came into that room the true and the false now who won the false one we know that but there was still a true church there that tried to get them to change or to stay the way there was that's the reason it's called the nicean council in 8325 and about 1500 delegates came to the convention or the council about 1500 delegates and the laity outnumbered the bishop five to one look at the power satan had though the laity outnumbered the bishops five to one but yet they still passed whatever all these laws the doctrines that they passed but yet through the nicolaitans the cold formals and constantine's political plan they out-voted the true church and won the victory and issued in bishops and holy order of men taking the holy spirit from the meeting and placing it upon bishops cardinals popes and so forth that's what i got myself a note wrote down here it says satan literally at that time deceived the whole world except just a very i'm talking about just several hundred maybe people can you believe that look how deceptive that is brother east they just said oh we accept that that's good now what that wasn't christ spirit that was the antichrist spirit it deceived the whole world just out of one council and it hadn't stopped right because at this time right here there wasn't a methodist or a baptist or a pentecostal uh-uh it was a roman catholic church then later formed lutherans later formed wesley or or methodist and later formed these listen denominations are not that old not as old as this catholic one right here and you remember that one brother brown said he said well white church he said i come to the original catholic church brother brown said i did two and this guy was talking about 325 or 606 brother ryan was talking about the one in 1830 when the holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost that was the true catholic church because catholic means universal but they adopted listen how much more today is satan adopting what he adopted in that one meeting with 1500 people and they changed the doctrine of the whole world to a false doctrine brother abraham said the father-son holy ghost doctrine come from where pits of hell why because it was a false doctrine everything false has to come from hell right nothing false comes from heaven so it came from the pits of hell and all these other things but now look and let's get on the lighter side though because the lighter side is god winked at the ignorance of some of those people and and birthed them into the body of christ by what word they could find luther west that listen they'll all be there like i said those people those people that went to nicea the true believers the ones that went under columbia and died like god like cattle over there 68 million of them they'll all be there they're just as much bright as you are because they got the same holy ghost you did but now their age required this remember what i thought reggie that quote where brother brown put the box up there and he said every age is required a certain thing right that's right we're not required to give our life in an arena physically but we're required to give our life spiritually right this arena out here is way worse than that roman coliseum right because you fight that devil every day not just one day when he goes in and go cut your head off no you fight him every day when you get up you fight him every day when you get ready to go to bed but they deceive folks the whole world can you think about that just buy a false doctrine right every denomination that came i wish the denominations would realize that that they they did get everything from mama the mother in revelations everything came from her first and then she had what babies daughters denominations and they go right back and like brother brown says and i think i got a quote where a male left it at home where now at the end time there everyone's going to go right back right yeah they're gonna go right back all but the true church the true bride will not go back this true church will not fall this true church will not do like even convolute the word of god this one will not go to nicey and counsel and compromise if you compromise you might be a foolish virgin but you're not going to be bribed so let's read matthew 25 let's begin right here just for a few minutes matthew 25 verse 1. now this is a parable and watch the parable and we're going to break it down a little bit and then we're going to see what brother branham has to say about it everybody okay say amen matthew 25 verse 1. now look then shall the kingdom of heaven now this is not two kingdoms it's developing under the kingdom of heaven right everybody got that right but what happens to the delegates the five foolish is going to bring them out from the kingdom because watch it says then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps now i'm gonna let brother ryan explain this because he does a lot better job than i do talking about the word virgin all right clean holy set aside then took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom so they were taking everything they needed to take except one had an item that the other one didn't right and five of them were wise and five of them were foolish they that were foolish took their lamp now they had something to put it in listen folks the allegory is that carried the lamp but when we're looking at the revelation right now you are it right you're the vessel that they're carrying to god or to the bridegroom one's bringing it full one's bringing it empty yeah but yet there but look in all defense of the foolish virgins they knew where to go in other words they had been taught to a certain degree they knew where to go and they knew when they run out where to go get it from and they actually did hear the bridegroom call everybody got that because we're going to look at this right here let's read it let's about but the wise took oil in their vessel with their lamps and was it oils top of the holy ghost we know that while the bridegroom tarried oh my we don't want to read this only five of them slumbered and slipped you ever read it that way they all fell asleep all ten of them right fell asleep oh my well we thought them we thought them five wives buddy they got all their lamp they heading to meet the bridegroom something happened they all slumbered and slept while the bridegroom tarried brother brown tells you he said while the bridegroom tarried through seven church ages the bride slumbered and slept sure they were brides sure they were child of god but they slumbered and slept through the church ages and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all the virgins rose so they all heard the voice listen we come down we're coming down here to the end time and let me just make it real plain we got the holy ghost and the group does not have the holy ghost everybody got that and there's no tweeners is what we are no tweeners all right either you got it or you don't got it so there's a group that does have it and there's a group that does not have it but now listen what did i say about deception deception is these five believe they got what that five got because they're taking their lamps they're taking and look they took no oil with them but they knew they were going to try to go get some that's right but the foolish said unto the wives then all these virgins rose and trim now look they even all trimmed their lamps they knew what to do let me put it this way they knew the order of the church amen they knew the order of the church it wasn't you're not talking about foolish virgins that are out there in the world no these are virgins these are people that have tried to be as clean as they can be right but something blinded their eyes and you got you can only be blinded by the word of god false shepherds brother brown said blinding the people and the foolish said unto the wise y'all been preaching y'all been preaching up at lula that you got to be justified that you got to be sanctified and you got the holy ghost well well my preacher just told me all i got to do is believe and and that seed just pops to life that always was and and i just am i'm perfect really how can one be teaching one and one be teaching another and they both be right right exactly right then i'm just using us just to make the example you can use whatever church you want to that preaches the truth yeah why would false want to go false they're looking for truth these foolish virgins are looking for something they not had right but they knew where to go look because they they've been listening on the internet for never anyway but that's what's happening folks i only mean here i mean there has got to be a true message going out in this land somewhere i still contend it's right here but it's every it's other places too but there's got to be the truth something for the foolish to have to come and try to find and not be hidden in the corner right they got to know where to come and get it at and the foolish setting of the wise conversation they know who they are give me some of them tapes back in the 90s and brother dale preached seal there in the 80s give me some of them tapes you know what the wives said you've had 40 years i'm sorry you've had 40 years to listen to the message of the hour you've had 50 years to list to find the truth somewhere because look the wise answer to saying not so lest there be not enough for us because you only we aren't going to get in by the skin of our teeth right yeah the skin of our teeth you watch these big airplanes you know when they take off they got so much fuel i am not a lot extra because in case something happens right or they dump it and they don't want to dump 50 000 gallons so they got just enough to maybe get them maybe another hour in other words they got just enough to get them to where they're going because of the weight limitations and all these different things amen same way with us we have weight limitations right yes amen study that we got weight limitations this is what are you full are you empty are you in between all right if you fall then somebody ought to know you're full and that's where they're going to come and say you're full of oil now see i'm not going to go to i'm going to use brother louise i'm not gonna go to brother louise if i know he ain't got no oil and so i need some more brother we said dummy i need something too right you gotta find in other words there's got to be this is the whole thing from this week it's been sound there is a true church there is a true people and they are ringing out the gospel in the end time they are what doesn't matter if people like them or love them doesn't matter that but that but the reason being is they got to have somebody for them foolish version to go to to fulfill that scripture right there like you were talking about fulfilling the scripture about the the sixth thing about the woman right there's the same thing there's got to be a wise virgin let's get oil enough to get out of here glory and be what be able to have so much of it though for their self but that somebody can see and want it want the oil you got remember you remember when when who was that i can't remember in the old in the new testament where they come up and they were preaching and they said well we don't know if there'd be any holy ghost right they baptized they were john's converse and all these different things with paul or one of them said you need to be re-baptized but remember they preached the word laid their hands on the holy ghost fell he said we don't even they were preaching jesus christ without the holy ghost and not even knowing about the holy ghost coming back they just preached that jesus was the christ that's right well what's happening now but how did they hear it there was a true person there was a true gospel walked in that door one day and said what are y'all talking what do you mean and they said we don't know anything about this holy ghost teach us tell us how to get justified sanctified and filled with the holy ghost don't tell me this garbage you always was eternally all you need to do is just come and lay down in the message pew it's not even according to the bible folks take it back to the bible the bible is our absolute amen but the wise answered and said not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go you rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves now watch and while they went to buy go try another place we only got all we got all we got go find another place but look while they were gone here's the key while they were out looking for oil god came the bridegroom came glory and who was standing there the five wives the true church was standing there ready to go waiting to go as as we uh so here brother brown tell that story so vivid about the armored meat packing boy and he had the one dog you know they had the three the four daughters three of them was the denominational church and they dressed up and they who hot around him you know and he looked at the one back there washing dishes and but you know what he told him he said i'll be back in one year to get you he didn't come back to get them other three he had found a character to come and when he walked back in that door that one year later she knew he was coming just for her not for three or four or eight or ten he come back to get one right right that's what he's coming back folks to get one bride now i'm sure them three women i'm sure as brother brown tells the story they they still thought they had a chance you know they put their brother-in-law said manicure they put their manicure home it's a little different but make up but they put that up and they danced around but you know what he'd made up his mind a year later i mean the year before that right who he was coming back after it did not matter how much they shouted spoke in tongues and phil pughs he was coming after that one girl and that because what that one girl was true she was a true bride those others look those others were potential brides they were female they were potential bride but he only came back to get one he come to get the true bride and while they went to buy the armored meat packing boy came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut no more sick couldn't get in three couldn't get in two couldn't get in one extra couldn't get in but afterwards came also the other virgin saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said now see so the lord's not just totally leaving them without anything because remember the prophet of god told us and i couldn't find that quote because i couldn't figure out how it was worded where brother brown said that that there would be a small voice would tell you that you missed it i mean when we clean out of here and get out of here there'll be a small voice say you missed it that's what's happening right here he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not right that meat packing boy he didn't study them other three girls he probably didn't even know what color clothes they had on but he did that one right he knew that one true girl he was coming back after her he didn't care what him other ones had on and he says i know you not watch therefore for you no not whether the days of the hour or in the son of man see that's what they're missing they're missing the coming of the son of man not that you know like i said before they and talk to some a denomination little person and just ask him say well what is this eastern cloud what's this christ coming down through the eastern skies because you know we sing the song and we know that that the bible says he'll that every eye shall see him and he'll come down through the clouds and apart the sky that's where the denominations have been taught you hear what i'm saying taught that that's when christ is coming to get down and i told a friend of mine that i worked with he said i'll just and he was sincere oh so sincere he said i'll be so glad when i can look up in that sky and i can see the the clouds part and jesus walk down and come and get me and i said that's okay i said but my bible tells me he's going to come and get a group like a thief in the night he's going to be come and get a secret group of people now you might see him coming down the east but you brother brown said he's coming for judgment he's not coming to get a bride when the whole world sees him come down the the portals of glory no right no watch therefore for you know neither the day of the hour wherein the son of man that's what we're living under now the son of man and who is the son of man he's the word but where's the word it's inside you me and you you and i are the wise virgins let's listen to what brother brown said right here real quick and we'll be done but do you see though where the two spirits are though how close it is even with the wise and the foolish virgin the wise virgin is they have the holy spirit the foolish virgin have just enough of some kind of spirit to make them i'll read this in a minute that's why you know brother brown said you could have the holy ghost on your spirit every day of your life and die and go to hell so close it's where that holy spirit's at right in the wise virgins it was in their lamp right the foolish version their lamps were empty but now they were clean they trimmed their lamps they cleaned everything up i'm just telling you folks we need to watch and not miss the true church not miss the true true church because if you're not in the true church you're in the false one right there's no in-betweener all right look at number six here real quick israel in the church and that's what's going to happen one of these days brother when the separating time comes and to you you lukewarm church member that you're trying to impersonate christianity one of these days you're gonna try to follow that holy ghost band and you'll find out your wheels will come off yonder in the mud somewhere that's right there was ten virgins went to meet the lord five of them were wise and five foolish put oil in your lamp tremor bright one of these days they're going up all right let's read number seven 10 virgins and 144 000 and listen to this it's kind of a long quote but i like it now watch both of them were virgins now think about what i just said that was me quoting for the ones on the internet that was me quoting not brother adam this is him quote now let me get this here let's take these two right here this is the virgin and this is a virgin this is a foolish virgin and this is a wise virgin he may be setting something up on the counter or something but both of them are virgins now you'll take that name virgin and run it down it means holy clean sanctified so we're not talking about a dirty group of people we are not never i and this whole time i've never talked about a dirty group of people as far as what you see because they try to live the best they can the word sanctified comes from the word sainted which means clean like the hebrew word now that's a greek word saint phi means clean now the hebrew word is to make holy and ours is clean now they take the three words like each word has the same meaning but it spoke different like the word clean holy sanctified all three the same all right now this is a continuation of the quote but i cut some out because he was talking about a dog being in spanish being pie blue in different ones different so i'd cut that out because you don't need that i'm not splicing tapes okay you just didn't need that now there was the virgins went out to meet him and the foolish virgin now did not have oil in their lamp but they had everything else they were clean they believed in christ they preached the word look that they believed their denomination would let them preach they preached that the second coming the sacrifice the atonement they believe you ever tie up with a good baptist scholar one time huh you better know what you're talking about uh-huh sure had but you see so close said matthew 24 24 read it right away and you'll see it jesus said in this last days the two spirits would be so close together until it would deceive the very elect if it was possible it'll be so close it'll swing them pentecostals like nobody's business now listen folks it's already done that right right that's already been done and the pentecostals in this message has done the same thing sorry that made you a little quiet listen we're all pentecostal by experience right so we're not doing away with brother brown talks about pentecostal denominations because we're all i wouldn't mind if we had a little pentecost break out anyway a little good a little all gets spilled every once in a while running out all over the place all right let's read this last quote we'll be done this is questions and answers this is the question after the bride is raptured will any of the foolish virgin now watch the question after the bride is rapture will any of the foolish virgin be saved or will they all be lost now look he says no no they won't be saved he's not saying or they'll all be lost no no see everything will be finished for the gentile church when the bride is taken from the earth everybody got that all right the spirit of god leaves the earth now the only time you're going to see that spirit of god any time after that until the millennium is where jews 144 000 god comes from here he goes over to the jews he's not working through the foolish virgin they have no oil that oil is now going to be used over in israel through two prophets to bring out 144 thousand all gentiles is done with the spirit of god leaves the earth he just felt his filthy steel he does righteousness righteous still he that is holy as holy still in other words the sanctuary becomes smoky where the attorney stands to plead the case christ leaves the sanctuary his days of mediatorial is over the rapture comes he leaves from the sanctuary goes forth and takes the book of redemption and claims everything he redeem he's redeemed because look the foolish virgin is not in redemption considered in that part of redemption now they will be redeemed right but they're not they redeemed when the redeemed they're gathering it thee that's not for this virgin that's not a cup of water that's not jews at that point there's no more military work how many understand that i got it on one of the seals or one of the other seals i believe it was that christ comes forth to claim his mediator work now look now just a minute will the foolish virgin be saved no now you've got to be careful they will be saved at the white zone judgment as far as saved from hell but to be saved on earth no they won't be saved in this part like we're me and you right now no they will not be saved here on the earth they'll have to go to the white zone judgment they'll and you know what they'll do though but here's the point they'll keep their testimony during the tribulation period and give their life and stand up and say look we may have missed it i like that though really i don't want to be one but you stand there and say i might have missed it but you're not going to make me bad at what you're doing so there god is going to he's already sanctified him he's not going to give him the holy ghost but he's going to give them at the white throne judgment he says what the bible say if you stand for me i'll stand for you so they stood for what they believed in in the tribulation but look folks don't think we can get in and just say well i think i'll just not read or or study no more and i'll just be a foolish virgin god knows you said that right and that ain't gonna work amen but listen what's wrong be a wise version get the holy ghost he'll give it to everybody that asked for it and asked for it the right way now just a minute will the footless virgin be saved no they will not be saved here on the earth during the time of the gentiles they will not be saved but they will be saved at the white throne judgment everybody got that say ma'am now whatever happens she happens now after that time she's in the state now she will have to go through the tribulation period and the reason of it is because she has rejected the atonement look he just said they had the atonement up here but they rejected it in its fullness they only went so far they went outer court inner court never went into the holy of holies everybody got that they didn't receive it in this fullness because to receive it in his fullness is you become a partaker of what's inside of that holy of holies amen everybody okay with that the reason she is is because she has rejected the atonement in its fullness in other words some preacher says well sister you haven't cut your hair you believe the message well you got it well she just sits there and says okay i got it not without an experience she ain't got it and i say she i mean church i don't mean a woman i mean the church but why they were blinded by false shepherds because he might have preached the atonement as just believing this message instead of believing the atonement that jesus christ died for your sins and you've got to be justified sanctified and filled with the holy ghost to receive the new birth oh boy she's a believer a professed believer right but she will have to go through the tribulation period the bible said and the rest of them the dragon spurted water out of her mouth to go and make war and what an hour that is and that's what happens the dragon what satan or you can say whatever system you want to say roman catholic church spurted water out of its mouth and made war what that's where brother brown says they're going to have to give their life for the gospel be hunted down like dogs but now don't tell me though that the attitude of all those say five foolish virgins they gotta all be the same you can't have one with an attitude i mean one i mean one somebody say well i didn't make it so i'm just i'm just i ain't gonna fool with this i'm just gonna god knows that right a true foolish virgin will hold true all the way through just like a true believer just like this true church just like this true doctrine i'm talking about this true message i'm talking about it will take us in a rapture but whatever they had was a part not the fullness right they rejected the fullness right they didn't reject the part believe when the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved they believed brother brown says there she is a believer a professed believer but somebody told her in a false church with a false preacher that you're okay no problem you come to church you i see your hair's long sister you don't put on no makeup that's why brother dale says he preaches to the heart of you and see that's what we try to reach the heart of you what's inside will definitely manifest on the outside don't get me wrong but if you preach to what's inside to me see that's the fullness because where are you going in the fullness you're going into the holy of holies glory everybody's got a holy of holies some are unholy some are holy but that's what a preacher should preach is to your little box right in here your soul but let's be careful because that doctrine almost 2 000 years ago fooled the whole world except a small group of people and out of there is going to be foolish virgins in every church age has foolish virgins right right it didn't say just one time here at the end time no i mean you know it says the bridegroom cometh but you've got to understand that when they hear the call they're going to come up out of the ground right they may be passed on literally like paul irenaeus martin their group they're gone on but they're true they're not foolish virgins they're true brides and when they hear that bridegroom call but where does it come from it doesn't come from a megaphone that's why people are that's what that brother was you know he's waiting for the truth and jesus just to kind of somehow walk up on a cloud and say i'm here that's not the way it's going to be but you know what he's living off what he was told yeah just like most of you fall for don't you don't fall now but most of you fell for that old thing they ain't a bit of scripture for it they're all mama she's walking the streets of gold with jesus right now well now who told them that god sent us a prophet to tell us that's not happening until we get to glory right now they're sitting in a sixth dimension eternal though praising god but they're not seeing jesus that cleared all that up see it's not convoluted for us anymore and listen don't roll your eyes when they say that because you know what they base their based their believing on that right yeah then as soon as mama oh she just woke up in the arms of jesus or she's talking with jesus right now or she's talking with uncle earl well if uncle larrow made it she's talking to uncle earl but if uncle laura didn't make it she wasn't but you see what god sent a prophet to bring all that to pass to show what true what's true and what's false all that i just told you that most denomination most denominations preach that you're going to go through the tribulation now that's not in the bible now it took a prophet though to tell us that the church will go through the tribulation but the bride will not go through the tribulation that's right see brother donnie we had that all convoluted that now everybody's got to go through this tribulation three and a half years major three and a half years minor they got all the they got all the groundwork because look denominational doctrines didn't come from griers almanac it came from the bible but it was because somebody with a convoluted idea and convoluted means something that's just it's not true but it looks kind of true but what's deceiving what's that word deceiving believing something that's not true but it seems so true to you i mean don't ever go if somebody has a mama pass away in a denominational world don't ever walk up to them and say yo mama i ain't walking with jesus today just let them go because that's what they've been taught but see that's false when they come and tell you about the water baptism of the name father son holy ghost you know in your spirit that that's false but it's all they know that's all you knew wasn't it right until you come to light that's all we all knew we all come through them things but what does a true bride do she goes to the true word glory let's stand to our feet always the true bride will go to the true word she has to be because she's part of it and the deception is is to go part of the way just like the foolish virgin just go part of the way that's the deception that's the real deception you love the lord i tell you you just you i want you to i want you to just sit down and think what you've been brought through and everything now for some of us that grew up in a message just a little bit different but like brother boyd and different ones that come in the message later on in life just think of the things that you believe that you had to leave i mean really a storehouse full right but most of us louise brother all the different ones that i mean a lot of us grew up in the message and this is all we know which is okay but you still had your own ideas about certain things but think about though what what god had to change now you never change the bible that's right bible never changed but something changed in you that made you become wise where you used to be foolish because you went to church you did what you thought was right uh then people go to catholic church i mean they some of them that go more church than we do they go to mass they believe that that priest is changing that thing to the body of jesus christ and that they're partaking and they believe but it's total faults total faults right hail mary's and all these dif but you know what people will shoot you and kill you for it if you try to change them because see folks it takes the holy ghost to change you you can't be changed by your mom and your daddy you can't be changed by a preacher amen you got to be changed by god knocking on your door and somewhere you understanding that you have been taught false and you know what if you accept that you've been taught false there's hope for you if you reject truth you become a truth rejecter and there's no foolish virgin part for you because brother brown said word rejecters go to hell god bless you think it will continue us on a little bit further remember us tomorrow as we leaving tomorrow morning it'll kill us a big old buck man let's think 237 [Music] [Music] it bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above and just a little talk when jesus cleared the way hey that's right now let us have a little talk with jesus tell him all about her you know that jesus though is not going to tell you about what that song says he wrote your name down before the foundation of the world he didn't write your name down the night you got saved there's another doctrine that we can talk about [Music] sometimes the midst of sin may rise and hide the sorrow skies but just a little talk when jesus clears the way now let us have a little talk with jesus tell him all about our troubles hear our faintest cry he will land survive feel the prayer will turn him you know the fire is burning find a little talk with jesus makes it right if you have a need [Music] my eyes be filled with tears but jesus is a friend who watches day and [Music] [Applause] that he's going to have a true bride with a true doctrine not many different ones one truth one true doctrine amen you love the lord think about that he is not protecting you as an individual because we goof up all the time he's protecting his word and if you're a part of it though he's got to protect you what did eve do she come out from under her protection and you see what happened one word but we stay in that protection of that word foolish virgin is one word off they didn't go just you know what separates the outer court from the inner court one curtain you know what separates the inner court the middle court from the inner court one curtain young guy go through the jungle right that's all that separates you have you ever thought about that sitting in an airplane you sit in an airplane you look out there in that on that wing and you say i'm this far from dying the thickness of the wall of that airplane i'm that close right if i was on the other side bro luis i'd be dead that much that's how close to death when i think about it though in a natural though you're that close to death but who protects you you get in you get inside you listen you depend on delta to build the plane right you're right you depend on the engineers to do the thing right i don't care how much they pay them pilots as long as they get me there safe i really don't care because it's their expertise is what gets that piece of machinery safely from one destination to another and you're included in that destination because you're inside of that well now think more of what god's done there may be mistakes in engineering and there may be mistakes in the pilot era they call it in different things but there's never been an error in this old ship of zion he built it right the first time it's going to go through storms of life it's going to go through stormy seas but it will never crack up it will never fail you the sails will never come down they will never tear that old ship of zion but you know what if you're not in it you know what separated noah from the bill billions of people that thickness of the ark is what this this people were safe that distance brother boyd everybody on the outside in the whole world died right people don't let that much stop you don't let that much get inside to safety if you don't have the holy ghost please pray to god that you got it if if if you do got it still pray to god that you get it amen because like brother dale says i'd rather seek it all my life and and and then all of a sudden see beca well that's what i was going to bring out tonight sit back down we'll start over again i'm just kidding no but that's what it said if if you think you got it and you don't isn't that foolish you're a foolish virgin you're foolish but if you're praying and asking god because i'm going to tell you something when aaron went back behind that paper-thin veil when he pushed that thing open and walked in everything was supposed to be 100 what the word said one thing off meant death and he couldn't go in there and go oops that's why they said they tied the rope around the priest's feet they got inside there and they had an oops moment and they died because they didn't get it right and they'd have to drag them back out but what about a holy god that gives you the baptism of the holy ghost though he won't have to drag you out he just says come boldly to the throne of grace come throw back the curtain throw back the curtain if he hadn't throwed your curtain back i hope to god he throws your curtain back and you see the mercy seat which you see jesus christ and him crucified will you see that and then you say god save me if i'm not saved fill me with the holy ghost if i'm not full of the holy ghost even if he tells me i'm full of the holy ghost i'm still going to say lord i need more of the holy ghost amen you love the lord let's bow our hands just keep us all in prayer and all these different ones lord jesus we pray that you'd be with the people lord on the highways home give them a safe journey lord protect us all from this virus and the different things lord and all the blood work i had done today lord may all the things come back good and we pray lord that you would sanctify these people lord they love you they're given time lord to come out of their daily duties and come to church lord and listen to you talk to them father we pray that you give them a supernatural blessing lord be with us as we travel tomorrow lord keep the one safe here lord it's sick be your brother louise on sunday lord be with brother richard wife again lord that she'll be we'll have a good report by sunday of this week lord that she's come out of that thing and brother ray montgomery lord just may the numbers continue to go in the positive condition lord we know sister rita very well and i'm sure she's praying every moment that she can pray but lord i pray in that time though that you'll give her rest in her physical body lord so that brother ray when he comes home that he'll need her lord to comfort him lord and we pray for all the ones that are going through these trying times father you said you'd never leave us or forsake us and you said we'd make it through because they would be a true church and that true church would stand one day and you would come and get them in a rapture father we lean on those things and believe them we pray that you'd be with each one lord be with the pastor keep them safe keep all of us together and
