Nanny was sitting a little bit too close to me and they was wondering if she was driving or I was driving and you know okay but anyhow but we didn't get caught this time okay we didn't get caught this

you and we thank you Lord we just give you all the praise honor and glory for everything guide us now as we speak of you and read your word give us of th understanding in Jesus name amen Revelations 3:14 and un the angel of the Church of the lady ofans right these things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God as I always say he was the beginning the prophet says we are the rest of that creation all right let's go to Romans 8 and I want to read this for our thought for today and we'll go to verse 24 through 27 and then drop down to 34 okay now listen to the reading of the scripture and you'll see how it ties into the message and what we're talking about for we are saved by hope now that's not I hope I'm saved that's right that's not it that hope is a word faith it's not uh you know but look but hope that is seen is not hope what is it it's a substance which is what faith is Right For What man seeth why does he yet hold for it if you see it you say well well I I need a I need a new suit now I got a suit on it's a reality it's it's a substance all right but if we hope now listen for that we see not is not a reality yet but it's a faith all right what do we do then do we with with patience wait for it what not just by ourselves it's not to that point God doesn't just leave us when we make a confession but listen to what he says likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities right right for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searches the heart knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God now where did he go to and what's he do in verse 34 who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died y brother is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us you may be seated glad his Blessing to the reading of the word now what we're going to be talking about to today on both services will tie together but we may just do the other and we if I finish up we'll try to have questions and answers Wednesday okay and you just write down your questions and things or comments and we'll try to do that Wednesday if if I don't finish I'll announce it this evening it's according to how far I get along because I gave them a 25 quotes Okay for this one part but now listen we read there that he makes intercession all right now he makes intercession and see intercession is to intercede right for one you know all right now we're going to be talking about that we must confess that's right and the point is we must confess our position amen right that's right now we'll get to that and we'll you'll understand see because if we won't confess what we are right then we won't be able to confess where we're at and by that we don't know what to expect right now the world says and confesses that we're at the end of the world I mean the whole world systems right but do you think that is a revelation or just a statement all right so now we're going to be talking about that he maketh intercession Upon Our confession that's right now to confess is the same word as possess or profess and confession is the same word but confess is to say the same thing as another other words agree with it or or you know profess means like to declare openly right you know in your profession and confession is the same word okay now there's going to be a lot of scriptures and a lot of things said so I want you to keep that thought in your mind now there is future to some things right there was a pist has been a pist of things that we come through it and there is a the future of things or are the there are things that have not come to pass yet but what I want you to think about there is not a thing that has happened or a thing that is happening or a thing that will ever happen that was not confessed or statement of someone because that's the Bible is written all right he made known the secrets to the prophets and they spoke the word right so then no matter if you're thinking about the past are you thinking about the present or you thinking about the future remember it has already been spoken it was in God's word this afternoon we'll deal more with believing God's word amen all right believing God's word and thinking about it why we must believe it all right and then must confess it remember if he makes intercession as we've read upon our confession then our confession must be the right confession right now we'll be dealing with healing salvation whatever and if we put it on a basis now watch a confession we can say oh I believe I'm Healed I believe I'm saved but I don't know now what kind of a confession is that you know if c c certain thing took place you know I would know no if certain things took place that's a fact that's why we read in Romans why pray for something that you already have amen well you don't believe in praying now get that off your mind and garbage can and listen to what said but I believe in confessing more than I do praying yes amen absolutely because you can do I'll read it to you in a minute where the Prophet will tell you that's right you're not saved by your praying now come on FKS get it off your you know everybody wants to be picky picky picky and then you say something and they oh he don't understand get that off your your uh mind and listen and think about it see we know the word confess and pro profess is the same word we'll be reading some of that but the main thing I want you to think about that if he is making intercession what is it about or what is it and the Bible says he make an intercession what that's right Upon Our that's right confession that's right all right now God will do nothing what now until he Reveals His word amen right so that's what I said pie present future whatever it's all dealing with his revealing his word and what does he do he first does it then he reveals it what's now and then he makes it manifest so that's the way the word of God has always been and that's how the world was framed right we've read the word what and it says the world was framed by the word of God Amen all right do you know what that meant that meant God had to speak the word right not just well it it happen cuz he was God and no no no he spoke it amen and he believed it and would you like a quote like this where run around and said one day he said we're talking about a God that believes his own word you ever thought about that a God that believes his own word that's right amen well you know he shouldn't have any problem whether he says it or you say it right well he didn't say that the way I meant it well didn't evidently you didn't say it the way he meant it cuz you're not saying the same thing he says right you're making a confession but you're putting something with your confession that will cause you to lose your confession you realize you can be prayed for and be healed cancer anything you know and the next day or shortly thereafter whatever you take it you know you would die maybe die with that cancer why cuz you lost your confession right right now I've been over this will you and will you and with you for years and years trying to get a point to us and you know it's true you go to the doctor you're doing pretty good you're hurting you're having problems especially now you know we go to the Internet we look up and see what this is if it says you hurt right here you got a problem here it's generally this or that or the other you know we do our own diagnosis or how you say it you know and we get it all figured out but then we figure out that well it might not be cancer cuz it can be anything else and we go into the doctor kind of feeling okay well you know the doctor's going to tell me today now that I've just got a Gorder of growth but it's not malignant what see then when we go in in and the doctor tells us said that tumor that Etc that what you have the growth is cancer what happens you fall apart right you fall apart well everybody else in the country has done told you you had it why didn't you fall apart cuz this is a guy with medical training training or or uh diagnosis or or uh you know biopsies or whatever that he has determined that you have cancer all right when you fall apart right then you come back and you begin to think well they have diagnosed me with cancer and they said that it was you know lifethreatening it's this that or the other you know what I'm talking about well what is the difference in your faith when they tell you one thing and when they tell you another when they told me that I had leukemia they took a growth off they tested they done everything they came back with the point of leukemia well when I went in and they told me that that's what it was see they didn't tell me all the whole story because they hadn't figured it all out yet they said we want you to go over to a cancer doctor right and he comes in and the first thing he says he looks at me and I'm not going to tell you what to do or whatever not to do but he said Sam he says you have leukemia I said hold it before we start start any further we got one statement to make here that didn't throw me it didn't send me into shock and all kind of things I said we got one statement to make you ain't going to give me no chemotherapy I'll do anything else you got medically Etc that doesn't affect me in a lot of ways but I will not do that well I had to UNT told the doctor before he sent me to the cancer specialist I had done told him that he tried to convince me by saying that there's more modern stuff today more than this I said it's okay okay I got no problem number two doctor he says cuz that's what he said he said you got leukemia okay I said I'll do what you will tell me to do and do anything in the world that can help or whatever but I won't do yukimo I said you're sitting on that side of the table I'm on this side of the table told one of the doctors I said you Doctor him and I bury him that's just plain as because they knew I was a minister I said you you Doctor him you know and I bury him and I said you know what the things of the treatments and all like this is I'm getting to a point the doctor then he says well Sam I got good news for you I said well great he said you got the kind of cancer leukemia that you'll die with not die of he said there's two different kinds of leukemia he said one of them is a drastic death for certain almost the other one is that it's in your body okay see my point was that I had no problems when the doctor told me that time he going to take my kneecap off and that I had crippling arthritis I look back at him in life I said you won't do that well I still got my knees but you know what I'm saying you can start with that kind of faith I'm making it drastic in the state you can start with that kind of Faith but if along the way you lose it what have you done well it wasn't a revelation now wait a minute now you going to go back to your Prophet now and argue with him he said you can be healed that must be a revelation right of cancer today and die of it tomorrow that's right and what do we do we lose our confession he says well see I want to approach it on the basis of and we'll read these things as we're going along but I want to approach it on the basis of you thinking about confessing and how that's related to possessing cuz if it's really possessing it'll work y if not you know what happens after a while you go in as I said and and you the doctor tells you and he says you got cancer you come back here or where wherever and whatever you do it and you start a a a form of positive confession which is wonderful the doctor will tell you Dr uh Brother Gary Atkins dad told me he said you know if you can just get people to believe he said that's 50% 50% at least of it I think he said when he went to the to his first um you know teaching in the medical realm they told him said if you won't hinder your patience that 80% of them going to get well I think that was the statement he made but Dr Atkins was a man of Faith to believe he'll tell you about a case of a lady that uh and he said we never operate till we pray and I like those things but he told about told me about a lady that uh had been diagnosed with terminal cancer no hopes whatsoever and he said we were treating her the best we could do and said you know what she got well when well years later they come to him and they upgrade these things and want to know kind of what happened to this case something like that and they was asking him and he said the the lady got well well the the doctors you know they were amazed they wanted to know what happened how did she die what did how long did it take what did it do you he said the lady got well all right those are positive points but what we're going to be tying together is two things salvation which is really the word Sozo which means physical or spiritual so that'll be the same word so it'll be in dealing with healing or dealing with salvation all right now I do not believe so you could be healed today and die tomorrow right but we do not believe in really the possession of Salvation as a new birth and then being able to lose that now that's number one flat up front but if you're dealing with justification sanctification and in those Realms of your Christian experience you can be saved today and lost tomorrow right amen all right did you follow that one now amen if it's just justification if it's just believing you can lose your believing but if your believing becomes a reality of eternal life you can never lose eternal life so solve that we're out of that to start with and when we come through the message then you remember that statement I'll probably make it many times but what about him now he's making intercession and it's up on your confession now think on these things as we bring some scriptures and to think about it so go ahead and pull up number one a we just bring some scriptures and think about what the scriptures really saying Isaiah 53 and12 tells how he was you know he has poured out his soul into death he was numbered with transgressors and he B the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors now made intercession intercession is one who intercedes for another that's right all right made intercession that's in the Old Testament right bring it down go to the next Romans 8:26 that we just read we got to go to 1 b b 2 B well 1 b 1 a 1 B okay verse 26 likewise the spirit also help with our infirmities for we know what we should know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us Amen in other words he's making intercession because we're going to see in a minute he's the high priest of our confession right but now where's he at we're going to see that he's at the right hand of the father making intercession the body is still laying there at the present time right not a body dead body laying on Throne no no his body was given as a sacrifice and there's your high priest right now remember a high priest listen to the wording now a high priest is not the um the god he's one between you and God we're firm Believers in not a trinitarian Doctrine but God in three manifestations amen three attributes that way he can be our savior our healer our deliverer and all things and that way he could give his life right amen whereas God we would talk about and people are say my God can't die well we're not talking about God dying we're talking about what he done to make things work in the way that it's supposed to be but now watch as we read on in the scripture all right go to 1 C which is Roman 8:34 that we we read but I gave this A B C D and then we drop back I mean a b c and then we drop back to one okay you know what that is I I cut and paste okay I had these things in and instead of being so smart as y'all are to move this over here and that over there I just cut it and tape it and put it in there and I label it instead of putting it numbers I put one a 1 b 1 C then I start back over the one I a it's hard as smart as y'all are but I get it done okay Romans 8:34 who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yeah rather that is risen who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us now let's don't be calm caral well let's be carnal enough that's my point A lot of people are so spiritually minded they ain't worth a toot as far as carnality right not referring to it as Christianity but they said Einstein couldn't even tie his own shoes I guess he wore slipon he was too smart he couldn't cross the highway he couldn't figure out how to get between cars that's what you call being such smart you're dumb all right see then the point is what you can be so spiritually minded you're no good in carnality or natural life but you can also be so carnal until you you're not worth anything in spiritual life all right so we got to find the middle of the road right something that we can think about and then we think about the scriptures we think about the scriptures of what it's saying he maketh intercession for us now that's the point I want you to look at as I said it's not a body laying up there there that's the atonement right there no that's our carnalities but that body was made as an intercessor that's right that's why the Bible said God was in Christ reconciling the world un himself the body was created brought to pass for the part of intercession amen all right now see then he's not just laying there but you know he's got a job ever thought about what God is doing you don't ever think about that there's millions of people in the world today and each one is praying maybe and yet he hears every one of them records every one of them and he's there to make an atonement for every one of them right or else what happen to your God see right okay just getting a point I know I won't get to all these scriptures in this morning but he is what now go ahead we'll pick up number one now which is Hebrews 31 wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Jesus Christ now he's not only the high priest he's the Apostle the set her in order or to bring in the doing but he's the high priest that's his job you know what he's doing now high priest y right that's right I mean hey come on he didn't thr his thing away and go on vacation and comes back when we get to it the end of the world that's what I want you to think about I want you to get the reality into your mind of what's Happening that is not heaven just playing on Harps and floating around and doing there's things taking place and we read there where did he make us intercession with groanings we know what that is you got known and unknown tongues you got things happen that God can speak to you groaning professions uh you know confessions and that brother randam I remember him saying one day that he was praying and it just entered like into something I don't remember exactly the way he brought it but it entered into something well then just wouldn't very long after then that they brought this lady to his house or something like that and when they told him he said how long ago was it that y'all took her out of the car and that she was real sick he said something was within me calling out the spirit make it intercession now that's real it's not just a Hocus Pocus that's amen all right am but he's making he's the high priest but now what does a high priest do a high priest is the only one now we're talking about in God we're not talking about an individual bringing up and these priests and doing this and this and we're talking about the high priest the high priest is the one who makes the greatest atonement right he's making atonement for everybody not just an individual person but his atonement is making for everybody why cuz he's the high priest so then he got a job he's doing something that's what I want you to think about I want you to think about what's taking place now in heaven amen right do you realize in heaven there's altars the Bible speaks of it you realize now it's not up there bleeding and a bloody lamb and a dead body and no no get all that out of out of your garbage mind get down to sensible reality but there is a heaven right and in heaven there's a lot of things going on it come back to mind where brother Brandon was talking on I believe it's the seventh seal but he said we're talking about tonight what took place in glory 2,000 years ago took place the lamb takes the book but things happen in heaven it's not just sitting up there nothing taking place right but remember whatever is being done he's the high priest right and he's making intercession of our profession profession and confessing is the same word okay y now think about it Hebrews 4:14 says seeing that then we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God watch let us hold fast our profession amen right but if we don't know what's happening in heaven how can we hold fast our profession right well Heaven is just this just it's floating around or on clouds and just do it all right but you're not going to get the point of what I'm driving at either he's there right now interceding for you and I amen we think it as a well it happen one time way back under and it's all over with and we're you know they're just there's up our um you know we got it about like we used to have about the uh remember I remember this was kind of in my school years and that's a long time ago but and I didn't spend a lot of them but two you know they told you that you ever heard the old story back when it was kids that what Thunder was that was Zeus and Thor and a couple of them rolling bowling balls down through there and striking the bowling ball pins you know well we laugh at that and say well that's dumb well that's the way we think about heaven today is dumb we don't think about it as a reality now come on like I said we have 7 billion people in the world today and if they were everybody would be praying you know really honest everything right there'd be 7 billion conversations going to heaven and you know what he's doing he's sitting there and say I heard this one I heard that one I heard this one I heard that one I heard that one and if everyone true he would have S billion conversations or prayer lines or whatever you want to call it you said well that's just impossible do they no that's where our human minds are thinking remember Heaven is eternity but brother Dale I thought he' just done it one time ours where your trouble's at right you thought it was done at Calvary thought it was finished amen that's true but what's he been doing since then according to the Bible he's making intercession Upon Our profession right right according to the Bible he's the high priest according to the Bible he's on the throne so now we know for a certainty let's do it this way we know for a certainty that 7 billion people are not real Christians so he a I want to get this where you can listen so 7 billion people he ain't having to listen to them it's about 6 and a half billion he ain't even paying no attention to right come on folks we we don't think rightly according to the Bible and you get over the Book of Revelation that the prayers of the Saints is holding in a bowl and pouring out and that makes tribulation happen to the whole world because of your prayers that are poured out we don't think of the Bible as being real we don't think of it as being a reality of life that's why we don't get the point of who God is and what he's doing well he just a spirit just floating around for 6,000 years he just been goofing off cuz he done it before the world that's where I love your prophet in the way he speaks and when that struck me it just burned into my heart when he said even after all of the sin of mankind he said God didn't step in heaven said he come down to live with his people right if that don't strike you then there something wrong then okay what is that Aaron always bring if I don't do your cup something something not turned over whatever okay but listen Hebrews 10 and 23 three says let us hold fight to profession of our faith now here doesn't mention it right God is just saying let us hold fast our profession now look what he's bringing it to let us hold fast to profession of our faith watch without wavering for he's faithful that promised now what does it mean to whole F your profession when you think about hopei your profession okay go ahead to number four let's read what your Prophet said on Hebrews uh chapter 4 paragraph 26 Jesus Christ let's whole F our profession hold fast that don't mean just keep testifying no you got to the doctor the doctor said cancer it blooped you in you just lost your thoughts about what you thought confess mean holding fast your Perfection What when a prophet is telling you what takes place now he telling you not to testify no no no no that's right he's telling you in simple language because we read it and he calls you a hypocrite to think that you just keep confessing that's what I said that's what's wrong with the people they go to the doctor they come back and they say I Believe by stries I'm Healed and I keep confessing it that's wonderful we got to do that that but then after a while what happens you start getting sicker and weaker and after a while you start coming out with thoughts you'll say you know I may die this but but God put this on me to where that they could run test and find out some way to cure cancer now God ain't never done nothing like that that's right see that's our negative points of trying to justify the fact that we don't believe that's right why not just keep on walking and say I believe it right that's better now he in no way is your Prophet saying don't keep on testifying what's he saying if your testimony is not according to your life what are you come on May I quote your life is so loud I can't hear your words right something to that degree so listen hold fast that don't mean just keep testifying if you don't live the life you don't hold it fast you're living a hypocritical thing watch what he said you'd better be on out and just in other words that it'd be better for you to just what be on out and just say you're a sinner and forget about it y other words you'd be better to just go be a sinner and forget about yeah well he's telling me go be a sinner no he's not telling you go be a sinner he's telling you if you're going to live like the devil just be the devil right don't confess something watch don't profess a Christian in other words live something else don't profess being a Christian and live something else you're the biggest stumbling block the world has ever had if you're a sinner admit it and go on get right with God if you're a Christian hold F you're confession stay there so now what's he saying he's in no way saying for you not to keep on testifying because he plainly tells you you must do that but if our lives don't fit our testimony right right I wouldn't have one that said it you talk to him about it if you don't confess being a Christian just live something else cuz he said that's a bigest stumbling block see to confess we're Christians we should walk like Christians right be like Christians right there's nothing wrong with saying you're sick I know people they got got the positive attitude and that's fine I agree with it too but the positive attitude is don't confess you got something then that means you don't got it but if you say you got it that means you took it that's a l to that I don't have one but you know a lot of people will not buy a cemetery lot reason I don't have one I just never thought about it never want to get one you know lot of people won't buy ceter lot you know why because in the mind of preachers has preached to you that if you're going to buy you a cemetery lot then you're admitting you're going to die what's that got to do with it tell right just oh we lived in the days when it was all great didn't it I'm talking about in this message coming down oh we don't have no insurance and we don't pay no taxes and we don't pay noay no social security cuz we going to need it we're going in Rapture now buch of bums around the country having to live off the families and everything else you don't like that but is it true I paid mine went on down forgot it but Sons and Daughters of a king don't pay taxes well they run into the wrong guy to try to quote that too because I can quote too I can quote where Jesus went and paid taxes he wasn't just a king or a son of a king he was almighty God and he said render under Caesar the things that are Caesars but under God the things that are God Peter here go down and get the money out and pay taxes for you and me but you see we get all of that great mind build up and what's God having to confess listen what you say you are is what you are right what you say you are is what you are if you're a Christian you say what the word says about you right sir you know why you do that now I try to make it silly where you listen to what I'm talking about God's not setting up there Jesus Christ is not sitting there and one day you say he's a Christian he said he's doing pretty good I give him an ex next day he says well I ain't no Christian raise that now but you know that is pretty close because remember he's making intercession upon what you confess that's right right now we all know the story but let's read the story go to number five Romans Romans 10 let's read the story that we've all been through I heard this scripture read so much in the Baptist Church I used to I didn't like it so I read I'm honest I didn't like to read that scripture right cuz that's all they wants you to do get up come up be prayed for believe in your heart yes I believe CU I'm standing here confess your yes I'm a Christian okay you're a member of the church candidate for baptism and then go live like the devil well they got saved I was there when they got saved you think it didn't happen in Pentecostal had a lady tell me one time she said I was there when my children received the Holy Ghost and spoke in tongues I got enough of it after a while and I said I don't believe the one you're talking about got it I she wouldn't be living like she's living you know what she finally admitted so well I guess you're right but see our first point was a great uplift that I was there when my children spoke in tongues so I know they're saved oh come on folks we've been in the Baptist long enough in the Baptist it didn't make no difference long as you went up and believed and was baptized and you can just go do what you wanted to well I was there when he was saved his name's on our book yeah are you going to tell him he ain't saved that's when I got into trouble with the brother remember brother was telling me he saved I said you don't act like you're acting if you're saved he went off and told everybody I said he wouldn't save I didn't say he wouldn't say I told him he was saying he wouldn't save because he's acting like it okay but now look other words what saith Faith what saith the word is na thee even thy mouth thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach now that's not meaning you understand everything but it's meaning you have an understanding that's right amen right that's right it's not meaning you understand everything but it means you have an understand understand it yes right okay now then think about it but if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine heart that God has raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved that's right well how many times have you seen people say I believe and you know what they did sure are you going to tell me they didn't believe they believe Jesus Christ died and Rose and they believed he was living in their heart but yet something went wrong amen why let me ask you a question is it not right in the Bible terminologies that God doesn't repeat himself right you know why now I'm reading brother brownon so he just be but but see now there is things and brother Brown said it like this he said when God repeats himself you better listen so when it says ver early I say unto you he double stated it to make you listen that's right amen right if God does say things twice listen to what he's saying amen are you with me amen because he's double stating it to make it enter your mind and at least become a part of you cuz he doesn't repeat himself that's right he said something over here and he'll maybe never say it again right right we're going to be judged by what he said right now listen why did he make this statement again he's already told you if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus will you confess with your M yes I believe it the Lord Jesus died for my sin I'm not making light I'm telling you what happens sure and I believe in my heart that God raised him up from the dead now Paul's going to put a statement on there for you to listen to and you'll see why that I hated the scripture I don't mean hated it I just didn't like to read it cuz I knew had been used until it become a reality in my own life after being in this message for two years and seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost this scripture came a lot all I got to do is do this do you understand what I just done I'm saying take that part out of that where it says far and you just be repeating again the statement but when he says far this means something I'm going to express to you now of what this happens up here and I want you to follow that into your thinking look for in other words hold on to it I'm explaining it for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness it's a repeat but is we different wording watch and with the mouth confession is made under salvation he's explaining what takes place of you believing it and then you're confessing it right it's not just a point of repeating the same that's right it makes it a reality into your life I like the story you know that was told cuz I well lived in there of all of them got up the altar you know and all the kids and everyone in there got up and tell what the Lord done for you tell what the Lord done for you each one of them got up said Lord Save Me Lord save me one little boy got up said what he do for you he's ain't done nothing yet well I don't mean it wrong cuz I'm just telling you he's probably the only one that answered right right at least he wasn't going to take it on that I've seen things I've been you know the Lord I've told you about the things I've seen in my life and what being before I become a Christian and the thoughts that I had in my mind but at 18 years of age when they tried to get me to the Altar and that's all you good old Baptist wants to do is he get you all to make a confession make a joining right but when they told me he said you did that or I said I live a better life than your Deacon board does now you want me to tell you why I'm saying that I don't mean you today I mean I was saying it to them I said you want me to tell you words you want me to explain to you why I say I'm living a better life than your Deacon board cuz I could do it so I didn't believe in being a hypocrite then and I certainly don't now my sister you've heard my story my sister came to me and my brother-in-law had just got killed in a car wreck and my sister came to me and she said Sam you know that JC's in hell that was her husband that he's in hell today cuz he didn't have a chance to repent and said you better repent and go to the altar I've told you the story I love my sisters I love my family but I had more respect for my brother-in-law than I did for my sister in the line of Christianity and yet I never seen him in church never seen anything I don't back up that's the truth but you see they wanted me to come to the altar they wanted me to make a confession and one day I walked up there of my own accord and I said Lord you got to get me over this I didn't know the wording I was using but brother Rand later said said he said sometimes we have to get over the church to be able to get to Christ something to that degree I didn't know the wordings to use but I just prayed I said Lord don't let me hold anything don't let them be a stumbling block in front of me as to bringing me to Salvation for five or six years I was a deacon in a Baptist Church at 23 years of age so you know they thought a lot of me but then when I saw this message I had to walk out what if I have stayed and made my confession that I've seen God I've seen this I've seen that there would have been nobody to listen to it cuz he would have no right to listen to it you see that's what I'm talking about about where brother brownon says don't just deal on the fact of you praying or even confessing he said got to be more than that and if the life is not live then forget the rest that's right oh boy I got in trouble with two brothers one time brother Brandon was making a statement one day and his statement was talking about drinking and he went on to say and he says it something to this degree he said frankly I wish you'd try it see where you like it or not boy man they got all over me he wasn't saying for you to drink I said I didn't say he was saying to drink he said he was simply meaning that the devil says that no the devil don't we she drank he knows you're going to do it anyway but it was a play of words my play of words was never to say that it was okay to drink I said because I'm the guy that didn't drink so you think I'd be telling kids to go drink when I never dranked in my life the first alcoholic beverage I took was communion in this message so you know that I'm not for drinking but neither is your Prophet just saying going back he's saying hey don't be a hypocrite okay don't be a stumbling block but to do what the word says far hold on think about it with your heart you're believing that's soul right not dumping gears at Heart Right for with The Soul Man believeth unto righteousness does mean it all come right there he's believing un true right if your confession ever stop you're not believing right and with the mouth confession is made under salvation what should be the confession out of the mouth what took place in the soul or heart if you want to read it that's why brother random would say and they said brother random should we go do this should we go do that since becoming a Christian he said go tell them how the candle got lit why cuz that's all you knew right but listen go ahead to number six we'll read a few of these then we'll take up this evening from the message the Church of the Living God preached in 51 now if you will accept now what he done for you then now he's the Hebrews 3 and one he's the high priest of our confession now anyone who knows the scripture knows that that word is written profession but the same words translated confession all right in other words he cannot save you by the merits of your prayer now are we at it again the same way where he said whole fight to your profession is not just testifying all the time there's more to go with it it's not just save you by the merits of your prayers well I've said three prayers every day for the past 20 years here so I know I'm saved you can stay on your knees and never get off your knees for 3 years and pray all the 24 hours a day that wouldn't save you make a good person out of you listen he cannot save you by the merits of your enthusiasm y right are your good works y right so no matter how good you feel about it how much you shouted you spoke in tongue you've done everything right no matter how much you've give Paul said if I give my body to be burned right right he saves you by the merits of your faith and your confession stop it you say well he saved me by my faith you've only said half the story that's not what Paul said Paul said believe in your heart confess with your mouth right amen so we're going to read at a while when we get back to this evening where brother R said we got to go by the word all right so look he saves you by the merits of your faith and your confession for if you will confess me before men him will I confess before my father and the Holy Angels you remember the quote I gave you the other day where the lady said said I want to tell you something said I got the Holy Ghost but don't tell nobody now I can't go that way because the prophet that I follow says that it's like trying to put out a fire on a windy day right you saying that lady wasn't saved I didn't say that she said it herself God's making intercession upon her confession that's right cuz she took part of the word she took took the part of believe it in her heart but she never took the part of confessing it confessing is what living the life and going out and saying it like well brother Mo you know brother Mo probably was pretty mean guy in his life I like the way he said it he said when he come to the Lord said he went down in the road knocking on the neighbor's house trying to tell him about him being saved he said they didn't want to talk to me about me being saved cuz see his saving was more than what their saving they thought of their saving was going and joining the church or doing this out of the other his saving was telling them what God had delivered him from right but listen now look he cannot save you by the merits of your prayer that's right he cannot save you by the merits of your enthusiasm are good works amen he saves you by the merits of your faith and your confession all right that's Romans 8 right believe in your heart confess with your mouth not just one part both of them okay let's see if I can get a little bit more go ahead with numbers 6A the one we used one ago Romans 8:34 who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us he's got a job he's doing something he's doing it every day he's doing it every hour he's making confession or you know on what we say all right look at the next one Hebrews 12:2 looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith remember you're saved by your faith and your confession looking under Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross it wasn't too much of a joy set before him when he know he's going to have to die but he knew beyond that despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God what far what is he at the right hand far we read it morning AG go to make intercession amen he's got a job to do every day he's real busy okay let's go with this one I'll use the next two accepting God's Gift 1953 listen close you'll never live above your confession all right and Jesus is the high priest of our confession is that right the Hebrews 3 And1 now any scholar knows that the same word profession is confession to same translated now sitting at the right hand of the father to make intercessions upon what our confession now watch you say oh he's sitting there taking care of all things I do why is it this if we don't confess our sins what happens for am I in the scripture if we don't confess our sins what are we going to do we're going to answer no white throne for the Bride come on but the Bible speaks of a judgment seat not a white Throne judgment where he give an account of the Deeds Done in the body so don't think you just live anything you want to that's the point I'm wanting you to get I'm wanting you you to get he's sitting there watching it you say God ain't watching what we're doing come on get out of being carnal he don't have to watch he knows every move listen to him he can't do nothing for you until first you confess he's done it what is your confession amen that he's already done that's when did he die for our sins when did he save you it's already done what's our confession supposed to be you remember the statement when it first started our confession has got to be correct amen what is your confession he's already done it to say he'll do it I believe he'll do it I believe he'll heal me I believe he'll save me that might interest the people around you but it don't interest God he's wanting us to realize it's already done right look when you accept now I wasn't saved I'm not saved tonight because I get happy and Shout that isn't it I'm not saved because listen to him I'm not saved because the gift of God works through me that was him speaking right I'm saved because I've met the conditions that Jesus Christ required for me what is the condition word and the word says what believe in your heart confess with your mouth if you ain't done that watch I'm saved according to the Bible is that right see not because I feel like I'm saved watch him Satan can whip you around the stump on your feelings but he can't when it's thus sayeth the Lord I never had thus sayth the Lord that's where your carnality kills you right there thus sayith the Lord which is the word of God not because it's a a Scofield bible the Bible says the Bible is thus sayith the Lord you realize we're dying every day under thus sayith the Lord you know the Bible says thus sayith the Lord your heal sure that's right well it don't say it like that no it says it's stronger than that right but listen when it's th sayith the Lord he can't go do that he can't Wade through that that'll defeat him okay brother uh Anderson jump over to quote number 17 okay and listen this is at Thy word Lord I'll let down the net see how many good deeds and right hand of the father tonight make intercession Upon Our profession it isn't how loud you cry how hard you beat the altar how many Good Deeds you do it's your faith that saves you now watch him and if your confession if you'll confess it with your lip and coming what coming from your heart right he goes to work as a high priest sitting at the right hand of the father to make intercessions upon your confession Hebrews 3 and one now I want you to this is going to be this evening you're going to see brother brandham says this at least 20 times I believe that's about close number I've got about 11 or 12 of them I know where he says God can't do nothing until you confess it no no he go you argue with your Prophet so what should he say he cannot do one thing for you until first you believe it and accept it and confess it what to be so already done and the people today they'll go out and say well I felt better last night but today I'm so bad I just can't hardly stand it that's exactly when you lose your confession amen so that's why you can be healed Y and lose it I ain't talking about salvation right come on Amen if you're at justification sanctification yes sir read that's right if you got to baptism with the Holy Ghost you can't be lost that's right so that solves the problem okay that's just exactly when you lose your confession and drop right down no matter who you are how saintly how Godly you are you're a minister clergyman or you're a deacon or whatever you are are you've been a Christian for 50 years if you go out of here tomorrow and lose faith that you're a Christian and start telling people you're not a Christian anymore your back's lit now the backslide is not being lost right Christians backsliding sure amen you say about being lost said you're backslider right you see why are conf confession should be always positive and never negative that's right right right it should be that we keep confessing not only by his stripes I'm Healed but to say I'm saved and then what if we don't live it then our confession is no good that's right right I believe in backsliding I believe Christians can backslide but Christians can't be lost true born again now confessing Christians justification or sanctification you can turn around and be lost right if you're Justified and Sanctified but once you're filled with the Holy Ghost you can't be lost you won't lose it there's no way so solve that problem but you can backslide you can backslide to the point that you can doubt what's going on and I'm going to make my statement end it right here that's what's wrong with the people of this message now am I'm talking to Lula Georgia what's out there is listening that's your business to Lula Georgia I see it like that he just said it that a l lot of people are backslid I ain't de christianizing you say you're not a Christian I ain't saying you're not born again I say true Born Again Believers can backslide not to the point of being lost amen you remember the man on the Hebrew Book right went got him some liquor and down and dranking it beer you know what God done he took him off the S you know why the prophet said he couldn't let God Mar let the man mar mar his name that's why in the communion when you read that it says many are weak and many sleep they've died backslide where was your Zeal today that you once had I'm talking from the pull pit as well as you where's the Zeal that we once had where's the thing that drove us or we like the lady brother W talking about that lady that time said and I'm glad we we were we grow in Grace and knowledge said because when we was first started said we couldn't even go to a picture show yeah see she was saying it was all right now cuz she grow in Grace and knowledge okay and you know backsliding is not a hard thing it's a simple thing it's a small thing we look at it as not making it to church well that's that's part of it we look at it as this that or the other that's part of it but what about when we don't believe cuz here's my point now we must confess our position oh yeah we say we're an end of the world oh yeah there's there's a lady coming up to the White House we got all them things russan come after oil but what's that got to do with you and me right and I'll say it now there some of you arguing about who's going to be president now get that off you don't let that be a hindrance to be a smart elic that's to the other person that wants to vote for Clinton or you going to vote for Trump I'm going to vote for Jesus and if there anybody else runs I might consider voting for them okay cuz I think we got a poor thing but that's all right you still just don't let it be hindering you that's right you know don't let those things be a hindrance to you that you can't still be brothers and sisters and love one another that's right right right go if we don't you know what we're doing backslid well you shouldn't say that then what else have I got to say it why can't we bitterly differ as the prophet said and still be Christians that's right now he he's evidently not talking about bitterly different over who's going to run for president I don't think so okay I think he's talking about bitterly differ maybe even over the word and the things and the point of life and the doings of a Christian's in life don't you amen the other doesn't even mean anything we shouldn't have anything like that there should never be a bitterness in our heart towards anybody it don't matter what they do cuz come on you can't put bitterness to be of God that's right my righteous indignation got stirred [Music] up I like what one brother said there was two brothers one time fussing in a ministers meeting and they were just fussing away I mean it really hard at each other and they finally said we're we're not mean or anything we're not mad said this our rightous ination his brother got up and he said well what they're doing said when I do it I consider it I'm mad you know so that's the point Come On Let's stand I didn't figure I'd get to with the scriptures because see I'm driving at something so I would listen cuz we're going to have to confess some things that maybe even we don't see in reality as yet that's right right I don't believe brother around beating around the bush when he said like I gave there Wednesday that he's talking about the Rapture and he said it has been spoken now let it come to pass see nobody else had ever spoke it like he did so the confessions of mankind are you listening for a minute see when we confess there's three gods that cannot be a confession that God can make intercession upon right but if we confess one true and living God he can say they got it right so as I start it off with what let's make make sure our confession is right I believe the Lord showed me this okay if it's right praise God but now if it's not right then you got the wrong confession are you with me you see why I'm so hard about the way that I see things and say things was listening last night brother randam said it he said I have to make sure that I'm right he said because I'll have to give an account of every word that I've said that's and he said if in other words paraphrasing it in my language if you took something he said and he didn't make it clear when you pervert it you say he didn't say that but he got close enough that made you think that's still a problem you see why he was so straight and strict because his confession was what God Said remember that till this evening what is your confession it's got to be the same thing God says God never said there was a trinity right God never said hell was eternal God never said the bride would go to the white Throne judgment mankind has made their confessions y that's right how much more you come into the message God never said there was two Lords they were two souls or they were this that or the other he never said it so then he can't make intercession upon their confession I know we're humans and we make mistakes in our speeches and yes but remember it just take what thought is go ahead brother 129 anybody have a need cuz let's confess youed into the body with the Holy Ghost there is but one way to enter in it just as they did on P are you in the church [Music] triumphant are you in the savior's Bri come and be baptized into the body and forever more [Music] AB there is but one Church pral body and into it we're all baptized by the one through promised Holy Spirit the world we were all are you in the church triumphant are you in the [Music] saor come and be baptized into the body and more every cre has claimed to be I'm Healed let me walk into all the dreams for God have so down to bring his son true Bri are you in the church try are you in the sa come and be baptized into the body and forever more of many thought that they were in the body till the Holy Ghost had come when the word word of God was open to them they entered in and yet there's are you in the church Tri our sister Lord has problem with her knees and glor and we believe it we know it hurts we know also we must make our confession and then sometimes step out when it hurts and walk on and then be what you want us to be so we confess by your St our sisters heal and we believe making the confession upon that and you're interceding you're tying it to the you're a high [Music] priest in Jesus name Church trium you saying are you in the same say where he can intercede come and be baptized into the body and forever more when the bridegroom comes will you be ready and Your Vessel F and brother son broke his arm so we're just s these pray CLS and everything will be all right and we believe you father you make it all for your honor and glory in Jesus name chur say it walk on Oh Come and when I fight a good fight when I believe it just Mar over say thank you Lord or you in the church triumphant are you in a problem here take care of that you we do too in Jesus name see church is just to believe that's that's what we're going to keep driving and driving until we do believe it that our confession is about got to be correct see if we confess negative things we are negative now that has nothing to do with reality that's what I say you know people will come up with a point you don't want to say this because well you know you go down to the doctor and say doctor now my wife gets on to minute I go to the doctor's off he say how you doing I said I'm doing wonderful well he's sitting there wondering well what are you doing here so I finally come up with a point I say I'm doing wonderful except I got a cold would you help me get rid of that you know cuz I'm I'm I'm just that way I just don't tell everybody where I'm hurting and what I'm doing why cuz what it's going to do for you well I can pray for you hey pray for me anyway but confessing is to say what God says he's making intercession upon your confession now remember the atonement is made he's saying what the atonement says we're saying what our mind says the atonement said it's finished amen our mind says when we feel better is finished no that's not Faith but to confess it Lord Jesus we thank you we just ask you to go with us now as we eat a natural meal bring it back this afternoon that Lord we could come together in you and just believe you and confess it Lord and say that that by your stripes we're healed and then just walk forward we love you father and we thank you in Jesus name amen you're dismiss amen there is coming a day where no heart a shall come no more clouds in the sky No More Tears to in the eye all is peace forever more on that high happy gold and Shore what a day glorious day that will be
