job the 32nd chapter amen i think i've tore this microphone up already it's falling off so i don't know huh i didn't put it in my pocket i put it on my belt well amen brother wade will get me

praying for our brother and glad to see him uh still on the firing line amen we appreciate the invitation to come the opportunity to minister to you today let's look here in the book of job the 32nd chapter in the eighth verse uh the bible here says but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding great men are not always wise and neither do the aged understand judgment now job here is using a very powerful word it's the word of understanding but watch here he says there's a spirit in man and it's the inspiration so it's the inspiration of the almighty which is our god that giveth them understanding great men are not always wise and neither do the age understand judgment now if we could look here in the book of first john the fifth chapter i want to pick up this word here again in first john uh the fifth chapter and in the the 18th verse first john 5 and verse number 18. you love the lord this morning amen the book of john first john the fifth chapter the 18th verse john here writing says now we know that whosoever is born of god senteth not but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself and that wicked one toucheth him not i love i love how john's writing here he's writing to the believer's knowledge and he says and we know that we are of god and the whole world lieth in wickedness john's not questioning this he's standing there with an authority we know that we are of god in verse 20 and we know that the son of god is come and hath given that word given means delivered something or to be administered hath given amen us an understanding that we may know him that is true and that we are in him that is true even in his son jesus christ this is the true god and eternal life and john closes by saying little children keep yourselves from idols amen we ask the lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as we just borrow our hearts together here this morning how many would just have a special need upon your heart you would just say lord come and speak to me this morning amen heavenly father lord as your believers have gathered here today on this beautiful sunday morning this beautiful resurrection sunday that you've given us father lord when the sun is shining on the outside father we are so privileged to be walking under the prophet's message lord to be walking under a message it is the rising of the sun and lord to hear your prophet say in this hour there's been a dual sun rising the s-u-n has risen but the s-o-n has risen in our hearts to bring that promised life to that promised seed and this morning lord as we gather here today you know the needs of your children lord whether they be great or small whether they be financial material lord spiritual physical lord whatever the need would be father we are confident this morning that there is no need to great there is no situation too big but what you can move up on the face of the circumstances and i pray this morning lord as we have sung the songs of zion as the liberty of the holy ghost just come into the meeting now father may you anoint both speaker and hear lord may you take these thoughts that you've laid upon my heart may you help me to get myself out of the way lord that you could come and minister to your children father and may you not only anoint me to speak but may you anoint the children to pull and to receive from your word and father whatever is accomplished here today we'll be sure to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believer says amen and amen and may god bless you this morning amen as you may have your seats here amen you love the lord today amen i believe we've just got uh one one meeting here with you this morning so maybe we could just take a few moments here in the word and if i would title this this morning i want to speak to you for a few moments here on inspiration that gives understanding inspiration that gives understanding and i i have just been uh here for a little bit in a bit of a series or study on the benefits of god amen how many believes that god has given us benefits amen when you when you read the book of psalms the 68th chapter the 19th verse david will actually say he says blessed be the lord who daily loadeth us with benefits even the god of our salvation now we realize that these benefits are not coming just once a year or once a month or in a camp meeting amen but david says the benefits of god are continuous they're daily that god will daily load us with benefits now another word for benefit is privilege and that word privilege actually means a special right it means an advantage an immunity something that's been granted or is available only to a particular person or group it is an advantage it is a right it is a benefit entitlement birthright do freedom and liberty so amen privileges are not just given to everybody but they're only given to a particular person or a particular group now the prophet of god will say this this is a great hour and i'm so glad to be living here he said you know moses would have loved to have lived in this time all the apostles amen would have liked to have been living in this time he says and here we are living in this time and we are living under our privileges think about that here we are amen living in this time when the apostles were looking forward to this time he meant when moses was looking forward to this time and the prophet says here we are living in this time he says and we are living under our privileges how that god amen wants to bless his people amen think about that amen that it is not a burden to god to bless you amen but it is actually the desire of god to bless his people brother brahma will say it this way the church amen is living a thousand miles below their privileges another place he will say the church is living a million miles amen below their privileges so in other words what he is telling you is it's time for the church of the living god amen to come up higher amen it's time to come up higher john will say it like this amen let's come up higher let's come up in the power amen of the word of god now when you begin to look at all the benefits and the privileges of god amen there's no way to cover all the benefits of god amen but this morning if i could take for just a few moments with you amen i'd like to i'd like to speak to you on one here and it is on the benefit of inspiration amen that'll give us an understanding or that will broaden our understanding the prophet of god says in a message hear ye him he says now when a man is inspired and he reads the inspired word he said the two inspirations gives a result he said no matter how well you study the word it'll never do you no good so you are inspired yourself it takes your inspiration amen for the words already inspired so what we need today is an inspiration over us he said see amen the word amen god sweeping down with a new inspiration and breathing over us his power and his love in himself amen that it might inspire us amen and quicken us and awaken us to his word he said then the word being brought into the spirit of inspiration then you'll see miracles amen and things take place because the two amen just comes together amen so the word this morning is already inspired can you agree on that the word is already inspired amen so we didn't come here this morning to inspire the word amen but we came here that the word might inspire us amen then our inspiration connecting with the inspired word amen then you will see miracles amen the prophecy this way he said what type of people are we to be he said and inspired people amen amen aren't you thankful that god has sent a message amen that has inspired the church amen can you say amen amen the message of the hour has inspired the church we we are not an uninspired people amen we have received a message of inspiration he said see and inspired people through all ages amen acts strange to the world amen but they're doing god's will think about that an inspired people is strange to the world amen but they're always doing god's will amen i think it's amazing how that a prophet will begin to pick up this inspiration and in a message without money without price he said now the message has gone forth and i'm so glad that you received it how many this morning has received the message amen we received the message of the hour he said i'm so glad that you have received it and i pray that it'll do you good amen for it did me good to speak it in that powerful we have now received the message and i pray that it'll do you good for it did me good to speak it he said and i pray that the same inspiration somebody say the same inspiration amen the same inspiration that was given to me to speak it to you you received it in the same inspiration that it was sent in amen so the message was not sent in one inspiration and you received it in another inspiration amen and it's performed in another amen but the same inspiration that spoke it amen it's the same inspiration you received in him and the prophet said if you receive it in the same inspiration that was spoken you'll receive the benefits amen the same way it was spoke amen then may i say this morning this message is inspired amen the inspiration has not left this message amen the inspiration is on this message then right here this morning amen the same inspiration that was on the ohio river when the commission comes it's the same inspiration that is in this building today the same inspiration amen that came down in a tree and commissioned the prophet it's the same inspiration that is in the church of the living god amen there are no true inspirations amen the same inspiration that it was given to him that it was spoken it's the same inspiration you have received it in now amen when you look at this word inspiration it means the process of being mentally stimulated amen to do or to feel something it is especially to do something creative it is the quality amen of being inspired especially when evident in something i love this it is a sudden it is a brilliant it is a creative somebody say creative amen so inspiration deals with creation it is a sudden brilliant creative or timely idea it is the divine influence amen to believe believed to have led to the writing of the bible amen another place the word understanding means amen the ability he meant to understand something he meant to comprehend something amen to perceive the intended meaning of amen words of language or of a speaker amen now think about this amen understanding is not just hearing amen but it's actually catching it's actually receiving it's actually perceiving amen the intended meaning of what's being said i think it's amazing the prophet says in the first part of adoption he says i believe amen at this time he says i think it might be good to kind of bring the church to what i think to a complete understanding amen see positionally of what we are in christ jesus he said see preaching usually catches the sinner brings him under condemnation by the word he said but teaching places of man positionally amen knowing what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith amen until positionally amen we know what we are amen then may i say this morning amen the bride now positionally amen by the word knows who she is amen the first seal the prophet said now watch he said it would be known in the last day but it comes forth in a church symbol do you understand it church it comes forth in a symbol amen of a church that they know there is a seal amen but just what it is yet they don't know because well it's a white horse rider he said but it's only to be revealed at the last day when the seal is actually broken broke into who amen not to christ amen but to the church amen so the opening of the seals amen was not coming to christ it was coming to the church amen notice oh my that just makes me tremble amen i hope the church truly understands it see amen your people i'm going to call you bright amen now we have quoted that for years we we have danced the aisles on that quote for years i'm no longer going to call you church i'm going to call you bride amen but there's a powerful sense behind that amen i'm no longer going to call you church i'm going to call you bride that you will understand amen see a prophet was not calling you bride amen just to separate you and give you another title he was calling you the bride amen because only the wife of a husband understands the secrets of a husband and he was fixing to release amen the rapturing faith he was fixing to release the mystery of the word and there was only going to be a group of people called the bride of jesus christ that would catch the revelation that would understand what was being said amen may i say this morning this message did not come amen to make a bunch of narrow-minded preachers it didn't come to make a narrow-minded church this message come amen to broaden our understanding in the word of god not in the ideas of man in the traditions of church but in the word of god now the prophet preaches a message to church and his condition amen he said i want to speak to you this morning he meant on the parable on some way that even the most unchurched person here would be able to understand he said now we come to church he meant to better ourselves right we come to church he meant to better ourselves we come to make ourselves better people better christians better citizens better fathers better mothers better neighbors he said we come because christ has told us if we would come and ask anything in his name where we are assembled together as many as two or three that he would be with us and he would grant it to us so what could be any more be any better to us today than to know that we have at the church for to embatter ourselves and to broaden our understanding see a prophet here is saying we're not looking for something to embed ourselves we're not looking for something to broaden our understanding but actually here in the church of the living god this morning we have what it takes to embetter our understanding he says how many would say that's what i'm here for let's see amen i want a better understanding how many would say that's what i'm here for today lord i want a better understanding he said see and we cannot have a better understanding he said if we're going to have an understanding of god it must come out of god's word amen for the word is what god gave us a meant to feed our hungry souls he says and the holy spirit somebody say the holy spirit the holy spirit was sent he meant to take the word of god and to feed us by the word amen then we are the sheep of his pasture amen right here this morning we are the sheep of his pasture he said now we're going to speak on that a little bit the sheep he said the threefold being of god when he could have complete control of us amen he can lead us and he can guide us now what did jesus say he said my sheep hear my voice and i know them amen and they follow me amen in the lean not to not understand him he said what is a voice a voice of course is his word when he is speaking in other words they will not understand a theological voice that's teaching contrary to the word for the sheep don't understand that no more than an eagle last night could understand the clucky to the hymn they don't understand it amen because he was an eagle and the same thing with the genuine born again child of god they only understand amen the things of god amen then god has not brought you here this morning to open your understanding amen to the ideas of psychology he has not called you ain't meant to open your understanding to the ideas of the nomination amen but he sent you a message what can we preach this morning he has sent you a message and that message has come amen to open your understanding of the word of god amen see them the spirit of the spirit of god comes down how many knows the spirit amen and the word come together the prophet said the spirit and the word causes the sheep to react amen have you ever been sitting in a service and you've been hearing the preacher preach and while he's preaching something on the inside of you begins to stir amen something begins to pulsate amen maybe he's preaching on something that has always been a mystery to you amen but all of a sudden amen it's like something just clicks have you ever been there he meant something just clicked you know what the prophet said he said you've heard your pastor preach a many a time on the word until the spirit got among the people and they just screamed out now i know a lot of message people don't believe this no more but it's still in the message amen he said they just screamed out they could not hold their peace any longer he said why because the spirit of god takes the word of god to the congregation and feeds them and they grow spiritually on the word amen that when a person hears the word and that word connects amen with something on the inside of them and they can't hold their peace they got a shout out hallelujah amen amen thanks be to god amen that's not emotion amen that's not a feeling amen that's the word amen quickening on the inside of their hearts and an understanding is coming old church of the living god it's just not the hour to shut the word off this is the hour to preach the word this is the hour to declare the word this is the hour to let the word take preeminence in the church of the living god the spirit of god takes the word of god see the prophet said see then we are not here amen just as religious people amen religious world is looking for inspiration the religious world amen is looking for inspiration the prophet actually says they are looking for revelation amen are you with me this morning amen the religious world is looking for inspiration they are looking for revelation amen if it's okay brother i'm going to switch to this handheld mic i'm i'm ripping my voice amen y'all forgive me i'm so used to these things amen it's the blue one amen i'll hold it right brother wade did you say amen yet wade okay good amen religious world is looking for inspiration they're looking for revelation now the prophet says they've been trying to figure out amen for years the godhead now listen this quote in the revelation of jesus christ he said seed the revelation here how it's revealed he said men scratch their heads and they pull their hair and things trying to find out what the father what the son what the holy ghost is he said they're trying to make three in one he said don't pull your hair and don't scratch your head just look up he said for revelation comes from above amen so they're looking for inspiration they're looking for revelation they're pulling their hair out they're entering colleges to try to understand the revelation of the godhead he said but see don't do that he meant revelation comes from above amen where does inspiration come from brother branham he says inspiration comes from the holy spirit he said you've got to have the inspiration of god amen to lead you brother and that inspiration comes by the holy ghost he said yes you're led of the spirit amen sons and daughters of god they are led by the spirit of god amen now do you realize that sometime or another amen we've got to quit looking and start rejoicing amen what are you saying i'm saying when you're looking for something there is no rejoicing when you're looking for something there is no peace there is no assurance amen have you ever lost your keys amen when you're looking for him you're not happy you're not rejoicing you're not shouting amen you're nervous amen you're tore up because you cannot find what is missing amen but when you find it amen you go from looking into rejoicing brother andrew you've got scripture on this i do amen luke the 15th chapter amen there was a lost sheep amen and there was no rejoicing until the man found the sheep amen luke 15 there was a lost coin there was no rejoicing amen to the woman found the coin amen luke 15 there was a lost prodigal son amen there was no rejoicing when the sun was lost amen but when the sun began to come home he said let us kill the fatted calf bring forth the best robe amen and let this son who is dead which is now alive let us rejoice what are you saying i'm saying this morning church we are not looking for inspiration we've got it we are not looking for revelation we've got it then if we've got it this morning it's time to rejoice in what we've got it's time to rejoice in what we found yes sir the prophet said it this way amen paraphrasing the message of the hour amen has ended amend the search for inspiration and revelation amen how many knows he said it this way invisible union he says what time is it sir how many ever heard it say amen amen now notice this then we've got the revelation brother dale i met people they say we're looking for the revelation we're looking for the revelation but a prophet says we've got the revelation in the last days for the message of the lord god together his bride together he said no other age has it been promised but it's been promised in this age amen malachi 4 luke 17 30 john 14 12 joel 2 28 these promises is exactly like john the baptist identified himself in the scripture then today church we are not looking for the fulfillment of malachi 4 we have found the fulfillment of malachi 4. we are not looking for the fulfillment of john 14 12 of joel 2 of luke 17 we have found we have found the fulfillment see what are those promises malachi 4 he says god will send elijah to restore and to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers may i announce today this day this scripture is fulfilled amen luke 17 30 the son of man will be revealed may i announce today this day this scripture is fulfilled john 14 12 greater work shall ye do this day this scripture is fulfilled joel 2 28 god promised amen to pour out his spirit amen which would be the dynamics amen to the mechanics to fulfill the scriptures in the age and the season you're living in this day this scripture is fulfilled amen then what are you saying i'm saying we're not looking for faith we have found faith amen faith has been delivered amen to fulfill the promises look here in jude chapter one verse three the bible says i exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints amen jude here was going to write of the common salvation but the spirit moved over him inspiration moved over him and said don't write about that write about the faith that was once delivered to the saints he said see it had to come from somewhere if it was delivered to the saints he said see ask this question who delivered it who delivered this faith then he goes and says a little while and the world will see me no more yet you shall see me for i will be with you even in you to the end of the world and the things that i do amen shall you do also amen see he says the faith that he represented he delivered to the church to take it to the ends of the world then the faith to believe the message and to receive the message was the same faith that was in jesus christ glory to god it's not another kind of faith it's not a baptist faith it's not the denominational faith it's the faith of jesus christ and it's been delivered to the church to believe the message to receive the message amen see faith has come to believe that the book is open and to receive the open book amen how did we get the open book revelation 10 1 a mighty angel descends amen which was christ amen with an open book and he delivers that open book to the seventh angel upon the earth see william branham is not the book of william branham it's the book of redemption it's the book of jesus christ it's the revelation in the hour you're living in him the prophet said see that seven seals and seven seals has the book sealed amen the book is absolutely sealed do you see it he said until the seven seals is broken amen how many thanks god for sending a prophet to break them seven seals amen to preach the revelation of them seven seals it is sealed up with seven seals now that's different he said from them seven thunders he says this is the seven seals on the book he says and the seals will not be released until the message of the seventh angel he says so we are presuming but the genuine revelation of god will be made perfect he meant in that sounding and vindicated truth he said see the seven sealed book remember it was closed in revelation the fifth chapter amen but in revelations 10 that book is open amen it's closed in revelation 5 revelation 10 that book is open amen then see what happened to us amen revelation was brought to us inspiration was brought to us the prophet says it like this in the breach he said see amen these messages are all kept until this earthly vessel until the time of god's appointed time at the last messenger of the earth he said and all these things that people has judged at and said i know it's there i believe it's there they fought at it they brought it forth and produced things by faith they believed it somebody say but now well say it like you're awake but now but now it's going to be brought to us in revelations and from the hand of god by vindication amen see it's going to be brought to us amen in revelations amen from the hand of god by vindication amen then notice this when brother branham talks about them seven seals i'm not going to read you all these quotes i've got them if you want to see them but it amazes me brother brother luis when brother brown talks about them seven seals he automatically connects the seven seals amen to inspiration here's what he says he says if you ever heard it if you ever believed anything i ever said in a sermon inspired you take them tapes of them seven seals amen and if you ever heard anything that's really i can say it's thus saith the lord get those amen that was in a message called perseverance souls that are in prison he says seven seals was finished and when those seven revealed truths and if i ever preached anything in my life that was inspired it was in that what shall we do with this jesus call christ who would dare amen say that was it the inspired word of god when he foretold it here and sent it out beyond the to arizona brought it right back even with science and everything else and proved it so amen this book is already opened amen a vindicated prophet's words this book is already open that's right it's just waiting for the seventh seal to be identified amen the coming of christ amen world again falling apart 63 if i ever preached anything that was inspired in my life it was in them seven seals i know we're at the end time are you hearing the words of a prophet i know we're at the end time in the feast of trumpets immediately after the angels the lord appeared and told about them seven seals aren't you thankful for a prophet amen and preach them seven seals and if i ever said anything that was inspired it was in that there is where the angel the lord met us i love this and the bible become a new bible he said there it opened up and revealed all the things that the reformers had left out it was the complete revelation of jesus christ altogether new to us amen but perfectly exactly with the scripture that was the word which has always been now notice this i was so inspired and directed he's just testified about receiving the sword in his hand which was the king's sword which was the word of the lord which was the vindication of his ministry and he says i was inspired and i was directed god's power to transform amen since the opening of those seven seals i'm not a broken record i'm going somewhere okay amen since the opening of those seven seals amen the angels just behind the mountain yonder this bible has become a new book it's the thing that's been hid it's being revealed as god promised in revelation to him he would do and we are the privileged people amen what is a privilege it is an immunity it is a benefit it is a liberty it is a freedom it is an entitlement that is only given to a particular group of people we are the privileged people that god has chosen on the earth that we might see and understand these things which is not some mythical fleshly mind of a man of a person trying to make it up it's the word of god made manifest old church of the living god if anybody got a right to shout in lula georgia this morning it's the bride of jesus christ if anybody got a right to rejoice this morning it's the believers of the message of the hour you say what do we got to write this shout about amen you're seeing things that moses longed to sit in the service and hear you're hearing things that the apostles longed to hear but they did not live long enough to live in this time but here you are living right in the middle of it what are you saying preacher i'm saying come on eagles amen spreads your wings it's time to fly it's time to come into heavenly places this message didn't come to ground the church it come to lift the church come on now and then this message didn't come to ground us it come to lift us amen we was on the ground amen through the man age through the oxage through the lion age but under that fourth anointing amen would come a flying eagle which would be a sign amen of a group of people who were not earth-bound but they were heavenly bound people by the revelation of the hour they were living in now i know some people think i look they get a little emotional a little fanatical amen but let me just ask you something amen if a bunch of pentecostals have been painted face amen bob tared women amen can shout at a bunch of music amen if a bunch of deacons married four and five times amen can shout at a bunch of music then don't you thank the redeemed amen privileged sons and daughters of god who has seen the word who has received the word let's believe the word don't you think we got a right to rejoice [Applause] i say we got a right to rejoice amen can you say amen amen we got a right to rejoice the word has been revealed he said see that we might see and understand these things now i read all those quotes about a prophet saying amen that those seven seals was inspired amen to come to this point he says i've never preached anything under inspiration that i had to take back now think about that he's never preached anything under inspiration that he had to take back he said see i never preached anything in my life under inspiration i had to take back because i don't depend upon my own understanding and if my understanding is contrary amen to god's word then my understanding is wrong so a prophet is sowing you if you're going by your understanding amen you're understanding it's wrong amen if you're going by denominations understanding your understanding is wrong amen but when you receive the understanding of god which comes by the inspiration of god he said it's got to be right always amen now what are you saying i'm saying this message is inspired without your opinions without your ideas without my interpretations without my faults this message is the inspired it's the inspired word of god revealed in the age we're living in amen how many knows the prophet told a story one time he said see he sent them them seven seal tapes and then they got down there in the interior of jamaica he said they were down there listening to him he said while they were listening to him a lot come in the room he said and a lot hung over the tape recorder that them tapes were playing on he said and he said they brought that picture to me he said we took that picture placed it by the picture here in houston coliseum in 1950s he said it was the same thing in houston coliseum that it was amen down there in jamaica amen has another vindication that the angel of the lord accompanies the message always are you with me the angel of the lord he does not accompany andrew glover's ideas he just not a company a preacher's thoughts but he does accompany the message because the message is the inspiration of god in the age we're living in now can i say it to you like this amen i'm not trying to be fanatical here amen but i do want to share something with you in case the devil's telling you that the message is no longer inspired amen a few weeks ago i was out in tucson preaching at doug baker's while i was preaching i was preaching along these lines right here and brother bob i looked over at brother doug and brother doug was just kind of staring up in space and i thought well even you know i didn't know what was going on he was just kind of looking at me had this look on his face well after service he come to me he said with andrew in the back room he said lander i don't mean to i don't mean to be to be fanatical he said i'm not he said i can count on my hands the time i've seen it he said but this morning if you notice me looking above your head i said i did he said i was looking he said because while you were preaching about that word being inspired he said there was a lot come in the building and it hung right over the pulpit amen i said brother doug that's a sign amen though oh god the angel of the lord is still with this message just say what the prophet said and watch the power of god amen come in the church say what the prophet said and watch the liberty of the holy ghost break over the people amen see we are in an age we are in an ephesian age the prophet said see we are given the understanding by the word somebody say by the word that we are going to understand it amen because it will come to an ephesian age and we are here for them calls this age an abrahamic age he says where are we in this great time we're standing this great hour we're living in he says all the visions has been fulfilled then he automatically turns amen to junior jackson's dream of the pyramid on top of it taken off little crowbar like saying reaching in there and getting those little rocks remember said see i stood there a little bit and then the holy spirit revealed it i said the entire bible as much as has been revealed to man through justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost baptism in jesus name all these things has been revealed but there is secrets that's hit inside because the bible said that it's silva seven seals i must go there to find it he said then that morning when those seven angels come down and blasted the earth and rocks flew every way seven angels stood there and said return back to jeffersonville from where you come from for the seven seal of the seven mysteries will be open now listen this quote and here we are today can i preach here we are today i love how he says this brother zach understanding here we are today understanding he said serpent seed in a few days if god's willing we'll understand the correctness of marriage and divorce and all these things that god has opened every seal the mysteries since the foundation of the world and we've been in joy in the presence of his blessings that is true this day this scripture is fulfilled then the prophet told you before he went off the scene there's not another one coming amen to bring you understanding if you've got the holy ghost are you with me this morning if you got the holy ghost then the same holy ghost that was up on the mountain it's the same holy ghost in the pulpit the same holy ghost william branham had is the same holy ghost you got zach it's the same holy ghost you got brother lewis it's not a different holy ghost it's the same inspiration inspiring the church to believe the message i love it how the prophet said we've been in joy amen we haven't been depressed we ain't been sad we ain't been all tore up we have been enjoyed in the presence of his blessings do you see what happens when a prophet comes along and brings an understanding he brings a revelation amen to those who receive amen that word it settles the argument are you with me it settles it it's finished when a prophet speaks it's over see then the bible says there is a spirit somebody say a spirit there is a spirit in man it's not the spirit of a preacher it's not the spirit of a prophet it's the spirit of god it's the inspiration of the almighty that giveth them understanding look at what this word spirit means it means a wind it means a breath it means a mind a spirit of heaven it is a prophetic spirit i love this imparting a war like energy have you ever heard anybody say something negative about the message and something rose up in you as anybody in your presence amen amen ever said something a little a little negative towards the prophet or towards the word and something rose up in you it was like you wanted well let me just tell you in tennessee hillbilly terms it's like he is wanting to fight [Music] come on we're all human amen amen don't step on this message amen something rose up in you amen you didn't know what it was amen but a bible amen tells you it's an imparting a warlike energy it's a spirit in you it's a breath in you it's a wind in you the prophet said it this way in the battle for truth we are in the battle for truth he said them ends that has been lost well god said he would be restored again the last days i will restore saith the lord then ezekiel comes along and says a new spirit will i put within you amen i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh i will give you a heart of flesh the prophet said watch the order of the scripture now amen i will give you a new spirit i want you to watch the order he said they think they got the holy spirit but they just got a new spirit watch i'll give you a new spirit and a new spirit then will i put my spirit he said god had to give you a new spirit that's the new spirit god gave you so you could go along with the holy ghost amen with that old spirit you had you couldn't get along with your neighbor you couldn't get along amen with yourself so you know you couldn't get along with god amen so god gives you a new spirit amen see notice this and many times under enthusiasm i hope i'm not hurting but i hope i'm just uncovering a lot of times you think you'd have the holy spirit oh you said i sung i spoke in tongues being that close to it you might do all of that but that isn't the holy spirit yet see the holy spirit bears record of jesus christ amen then a new spirit will open within you then you'll receive my spirit the prophet said after a new spirit amen god promised he would put his spirit which is the holy spirit in us amen that will drive out fear it'll drive out unbelief it'll drive out reasonings it'll drive out fear oh you're hearing me the spirit of god will do to you what it did to elijah brother what did he do to elijah the prophet said it made elijah fearless he said i kind of believe that's added to the church now or anytime he said anybody's sickness nothing bothers us as long as the spirit of god is near and you know it amen amen are you hearing me amen can i preach to you amen y'all been through some sickness here lately amen but you're still here amen y'all been through some hard times here lately amen but you're still here amen brother dale's been fighting here lately but he's still here amen you know why because the same inspiration are you hearing the church the same inspiration that was there when the bible was being wrote it's the same inspiration amen y'all just celebrated 50 years didn't you amen 50 years amen has this church been dedicated he meant to the preaching of the message of the hour then the same inspiration that was there when edmond wave fell over it's the same inspiration in spoken word tabernacle the same inspiration that was there amen when hattie wright received her two boys it's the same inspiration that's in spoken word tabernacle you have received the message you have believed the message you've accepted the message oh glory to god what are you saying preacher i'm saying we are a fearless church by the inspiration of the holy ghost yes sir he should let a person ever be so sick and let the holy spirit come in the room and anoint that person you'll see a changed person in a few moments hello you'll see a changed person in a few moments yes sir why because his word which is scripture says by my stripes ye are healed i am the lord that healeth all thy diseases are you hearing me then what is scripture given by it is given by divine inspiration what did paul tell the temp say to timothy he said all scripture is given by inspiration of god he's now the prophet picks this up and says the same word somebody say the same word that inspired the disciples it inspired the first row of disciples then the next as they followed down to the lutheran age through the methodist age in every age and is just as sufficient and inspiring today to us as it was the first day it was given think about that amen the first time that moses read i am the lord that healeth all thy diseases amen that same inspiration that oh god are you with me that moved over moses to go before two million people with one prescription for a journey amen i am the lord god that healeth all thy diseases that same word is being preached here today and the same inspiration amen can we open up and have church amen the same inspiration that was on moses when he spoke it is on you when you read it and receive it it's the same word it's the same inspiration of god amen the prophet said see then what does real inspiration do he said real divine inspiration comes amen by doing the will of god it's not human inspiration amen it's divine inspiration see in other words the prophet says god would be known to his church not in three people but as one person the mystery of god would be revealed and when that was completely revealed then the seven mysteries would open the church because in there somebody say in there because in there the church would be living under the inspiration of the holy ghost the church would be living under the inspiration of the holy ghost he says him moving in and out and showing his signs of being alive and among us living among us we're then worshipping the living christ that is among us we are worshiping the living christ that is among us amen see that what is inspiration done it has been poured out somebody say poured out it has been poured out upon the elect of each age the prophet said if that genuine holy ghost is in you which is the word manifested you will see the message of the hour because it's the holy spirit that does it amen but if that if there has to be something like that off inspiration strike you and if you pour water on the ground on the ground and there's no seed in there to strike it how can they ever bring forth anything there's nothing there to bring forth that's it only the elected of god will see it he said see now while the inspiration's poured out amen together the bride together it's only the elected who will see it what did the prophet say he said an inspired people will always be a strange people to the world but they'll always be doing the will of god amen then he comes along in modern events and says when you see the church getting worldly like it was in the days of sodom you see the church world going into worship the god of this evil age and seeing that how many sees the church world getting worldly amen it don't take a amen amen with me now it don't take a profit to see that amen the church world is getting worldly amen amen sinners can look at denominations and see they're nothing but a bunch of hypocrites amen worldly amen sin loving amen immoral living are you with me this morning amen the church world is getting worldly at the same time the prophet said the world the church world amen is worshipping the god of this evil age how many knows they're worshiping the god of this evil age he said and see in that amen now we see the negative don't we brother bob we see sodom we see the church world getting worldly we see them worshipping the god of this evil age seeing that but then seeing a little minority group who would be gathered out under the inspiration of god producing again the life of jesus christ by the scriptures amen that's supposed to happen you know what hour you're living in glory to god you know what hour you're living in then this morning church we may be a minority brother samuel we may be a bunch of crazy amen man followers well i got that close to it i might as well preach that now hello i got that close to we might as well go there amen they actually say we're man followers amen do you realize we're the only people on the earth amen and religion today that's not following a man hello we're the only ones that's not following a man what do you mean preacher amen okay amen your baptist friends how are they baptizing in the name of the father of the son and the holy ghost you know why they're baptized like that because a man told them that's the way they all are baptized are you with me now amen you know why they're wearing makeup because a man told them it's okay you know why they're cutting their hair because a man told them that was paul's day that's not this day amen but william branham came along and picked up the bible and said it wasn't so from the beginning and for the first time in hundreds of years glory to god there is a bride on the earth who is not following a man she is following the son of man she's following the word that's been revealed in inspiration in the age she's living in glory to god come on church we ain't following a man we're following christ the word under inspiration producing again the life of jesus christ by the scriptures god have mercy producing the life of jesus christ by the scriptures see then what does the bible speak of the scriptures speak of two types of people a people without understanding and the people with understanding hear now this in jeremiah 5 21 hear now this oh foolish people and without understanding he says which have eyes and see not which have ears and hear not jesus comes along in matthew 15 16 and says are ye also yet without understanding he said see jesus is here with the spirit of god on him and it's come upon every one of you that's been born of the holy ghost and the devil doubter was upon them ecclesiastical clergy in them days and it's the same thing today isn't it amazing the same people brother that'll tell you you're fallen a man are the same people anointed with a doubting spirit it come from the devil without understanding he says spiritual understanding of the scriptures now watch this so people with a middle understanding amen they say well i got middle understanding they're still without spiritual understanding because to really read the bible with a spiritual understanding you must fall in love with the writer when paul was writing to the church of colosse in colossians 1 9 he says seek and to desire that you might be filled somebody say field with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding that she might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god he says strengthened with all might according to his glorious power until all patience and long suffering with joyfulness see so the people of spiritual understanding they will stand alone but they will be gathered out there under the inspiration of god in the bible you read about joseph do you realize joseph was hated do you know why the prophet said because of his spiritual understanding in the book of genesis cain was a modern man who built a church he said he built that church by a mental understanding abel a spiritually minded man by election was elected to the truth of redemption by a spiritual understanding only those with a spiritual understanding will be able to overcome in the last days amen without an understanding of god you'll never overcome remember i said look on the opposite side how that moses stood there and pharaoh could not understand him he said he didn't have this spiritual understanding that moses had he said nor could he understand the attitude that moses taken do you realize this message has changed our attitude are you hearing me this message has changed our attitude brother louis it has changed the way we look at things it has changed our approach it has changed the way we handle tragedies it has changed the way we handle situations it has changed the way we handle death come on it has changed brother said moses stood there and pharaoh looked at him and pharaoh couldn't understand him because his understanding had changed his attitude amen do you realize we're an oddball we're an odd group of people i was down there the other day brother zach at sister karen pruitt's funeral amen let me just share this with you we're just walking out of the graveyard amen amen walking out of the graveyard her body getting ready to be let down in the ground amen and and we're walking out of the graveyard and there's people standing around there talking about some morning between six and nine testing i said we're walking out of the graveyard they're fixing to let her body down and there's believers walking out of the graveyard talking about some morning between six and nine do you know what brother dale i think that those funeral directors have conventions year round to try to figure out what these crazy people are talking about in funerals when they're talking about some morning between six and nine ain't it but i'll tell you why we're talking like that because we had a prophet come who had understanding of the rapture and he said now here's the way i see it amen there's been three watches amen and some morning i think between 6 and nine the rapture will take place are you hearing me then you know what that tells me i can look the devil in the face and say for what you got at me but you ain't gonna defeat me amen because my attitude has been changed by the understanding of the opening of the word in the age i'm living in come on church let the devil throw a stroke in our brother dale he'll stand up and say is that the best you got devil let the devil fold covered at the church we'll stand up and say is that the best you got devil [Applause] are you hearing me our attitude has been changed by the understanding of the revealed word and the age we're living in glory to god where was moses's convictions coming from they was coming the prophet said by his spiritual insight he was seen in the unseen i ain't got time to stop here and preach on it but can i drop it to you for a second how many knows the prophet said amen you live between two worlds he said you live between two worlds it's a beautiful study sometime on visions amen he said i'm standing here and he said but i'm actually over there oh help me jesus i'm standing here but i'm actually over there he says now here's what happened then i'm speaking over there but you're hearing over here i'm speaking over there but you're hearing over here see he was seeing in another dimension but he was speaking and he was hearing what he was saying over here was coming from over there in other words he was not speaking to you as you were here he was speaking to you as he saw you there come on church amen if these preachers preached by the scene they would never preach another sermon in their lives well i'm this close to it might as well go and preach that now amen because some people come to church and you you know what amen we've been trying to get away and not catch cove and amen but there's some message people i've been around that i don't want to catch what they got you say what are you talking about they don't smile they don't say amen they don't raise their hands they don't enjoy the house of god they don't enjoy the holy ghost they just sit there and they come dragging out as brother donnie says with a big old long mule face and they walk out after service and they go to golden corral and they're pushing their tray down the aisle and the woman at the end at the end of the aisle is trying to be happy and she's trying to say how are you doing today and they're looking at it don't you want what i got where'd you just come from how'd this come from church you want to come visit us next sunday no they don't want to come visit that amen they want something that's got some emotion in it got some life in it got some power in it what i say this morning the message of the hour has got life in it it's got power in it it's got joy in it it's joy unspeakable and it's full of glory it'll quicken you when you've been dead it'll raise you when you've been down it'll heal you when you are sick it'll give you joy in the midnight hour it'll take your sorrows and turn them into happiness i'm talking about the message of life that has come from an unseen dimension to quicken a group of people to the reality not as you are but as a prophet saw you there come on church you really think that for 50 years brother dale has been preaching to you all based on the way you look come on you really think he's been out here ain't been preaching to you brother brother dale how many wednesday nights have you stood behind the pulpit and there wasn't a smile on the congregation but you stood there and preached the message brother wait how many sunday nights have you stood behind the pulpit and you saw it on the people's face they were down they were discouraged they were low they were facing troubles and you didn't get up and say well it's so bad and it's so horrible and times are getting worse and things are only going to get worse but you got up there and you begin to say but if god be for us then who can be against us if god is on our side over a thousand fall at my left and ten thousand at my right it shall not come now thee are you hearing me where were they preaching from they were not preaching as you are they was preaching as the word says you'll be come on when you go in the hospital to pray for somebody you don't go in there and talk about how bad they are and how terrible the conditions are come on you know go in there and read the doctor's reports and read the scans and the mris well i'm preaching to you amen amen you don't go in there and say amen can i get all the mris now pull a chair over here and let's sit down here let's talk boy the mri says things are bad the mri says things ain't looking good the blood report says no you take a more sure word of prophecy in that hospital room they're surrounded by death they're surrounded by negativity they're surrounded by man's opinions and man's best guesses of the future of their life amen but we have received amen a vindicated word that was not an educated guess it was a vindicated amen perfectly manifested word it says i saw you there glory to god i feel like dancing i saw you there you're gonna be there there ain't enough devils in hell that'll defeat this bride that's right sis there ain't enough devils in hell that'll defeat this church we are the undefeatable bride of jesus christ i don't know about y'all amen but i feel like daniel this morning i feel like daniel you say daniel yes sir daniel was in a time of captivity and you say amen the prophet said he was living in a time of captivity he says now watch oh god he says this may he come can i have a few more minutes may he come he says and open the word to us that our understandings might be opened and enlightened for the glory of his kingdom that we might be encouraged to live better christian lives are you ready for this and to have a good courage look at somebody next to you and say be of good courage now in order to do that you got to look at the person next to you not me be of good courage brother dale be of good courage brother wade be of good courage spoken word church be of good courage brother bob be of good courage the word come open not to make a bunch of stiff neck amen puffed up intellectuals the word come open to put a courage in the church that no matter what tomorrow holds i know who holds tomorrow no matter what the future brings i know brother samuel who's bringing my future it's the lamb of god himself so what happens here amen let me let me just have a few more minutes amen if you said amen wade okay good in the year of darius the son of his harris of the sea the medes which he's my buddy which was made king over the film of the chaldeans in the first year of his reign i daniel understood i daniel understood by books the number of years i think this first time we ever met was on this subject amen the number of years where of the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish he meant 70 years in the desolations of jerusalem and i set my face unto the lord god to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting sack coffees sackcloth and ashes now you know brother preaches a three-part series daniel's 70 weeks gabriel's instructions to daniel six-fold purpose of gabriel's visit to daniel and then he preaches the 70th week of daniel in gable's instructions paragraph 28 he said now we're speaking on daniel in captivity daniel is in captivity now watch this i love this and gabriel flying in to instruct him about the future can i put my dancing shoes on gabriel come flying in to instruct him about the future while daniel was in prayer gabriel the angel come in to instruct him the prophet said now i've been reading dr larkin's books brother brother dale it cracks me up we got a bunch of well let me just preach we got a bunch of spiritual ignoramuses that's left his message and they think they're doing the church of favor by telling them that brother branham used some of larkin's material i think they're pumped crazy because brother branham told us that himself hello he says right here i've been reading larkin's book dr smith's book dr schofield's notes different commentaries from men everywhere and yet i cannot put theirs together to make it come out right i've been reading it and i'm trying to put it together man's inspiration man's understanding a prophet brother lewis was looking at it but he couldn't bring it together to make things come out right he said been visiting the libraries in kentucky and some of the ancient astronomy and calendars and times picking up from the libraries and so forth all the ancient books and having my trust solemnly in jesus christ to reveal it to me because i do not want it to say i know this and i know that he knows my heart he's listening at me but i want it that i might enlighten his people therefore i believe that he will give it to me then larkin didn't give it to him scofield didn't give it to him amen smith didn't give it to him amen but the lord himself amen give him the revelation are you healing me church and the prophet said now i bring that revelation to enlighten you upon your future you all are well taught on daniel's 70 weeks so i'm not going to dig into it but i am going to hit this high point and then we're going to go eat are you with me amen daniel was in captivity and gabriel come in there to instruct him on his future gabriel did not come he meant to comfort him in his captivity and to tell him daniel things are terrible and things are horrible he come to say daniel 70 years will be accomplished upon israel oh god but in the end there will be a people who will come out of here and may i say this morning church we was in captivity of denominations we was in captivity of man's ideas about the rapture come on church some of you always in captivity about the coming of the lord you thought you was going to be on 85 in atlanta and the lord was going to come and he was going to wreck your car and clothes was going to be laying on the interstate and come on but that was man's understanding sister june that was man's understanding that it brought the church into captivity can i take some liberty here man's understanding brought the church into captivity amen on the baptism of the holy ghost man's understanding brought the church into captivity on the predestinated seed man's understanding brought the church into captivity amen on the serpent seed on the gifts of the spirit he meant on the water baptism on the godhead but all of a sudden he went out of heaven come an angel the same angel that met moses the same angel that met paul met william branham and delivered him an understanding and he brought that understanding of the church and he said here it is there are no three gods there's one god here it is baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ here it is the evidence of the holy ghost is receiving the word and the age you're living in here it is the shout the voice and the trumpet is the mystery oh god i ain't got room to preach right now are you all hearing me we are not here this morning as a confused people we are here as an inspired understanding holy ghost field fire baptized church we got a future church we're not confused the prophet said daniel received that revelation out of jeremiah's books the prophet and for 68 years [Music] this church is 18 years shy of that for y'all just celebrated 50 years right for 50 years y'all been preaching the message been singing the songs been reading the quotes been listening to the tapes for 68 years daniel was in captivity by the plot of god said in the atmosphere of unbelief he still kept the victory without one song to sing without one service to go to come on young people y'all are spoiled come on young people you all respond you all got more youth means to go to than daniel had church services in his whole life hello i was talking to a guy the other day he said you're going to have a meeting you want people to show up you know how to do it i said how he said announce it's a youth meeting you'll have 2 000 people are you hearing me daniel had none of that he had none of that but he had an understanding he had an inspiration what are you saying preacher i'm saying little bride can this church live again can this church shine again we've been through some hard knocks can this church stand up on his feet again can i preach to you amen amen amen can brother dale preach again are you hearing me are you hearing me i'm not a crazy man i'm an inspired man i've received an understanding amen go to ezekiel 37 and what do you see a valley full of dry bones there's no there there's bones here and bones there and send you there i'm closing or wade won't buy me lunch amen send you there and muscles there amen and flesh there amen but ezekiel stood over spoken word church and he looked at all the bones and he said can these bones live again can these bones live again the prophet of god said watch can these bones live again he said yes sir son of man prophesy you know what that word prophecy means it means the breath it means breath it means influence coming from above can these bones live again he said prophesy and all of a sudden there begin to be a noise and bone begin to come to bone and sin you and flesh and here they are all of them's connected but there's no life there's no breath in them amen but he says prophesy and the bible says the breath came into them and they lived are you ready for this and they stood up on their feet an exceeding great army everyone picks this up from the restoration of the bride tree he says see four stages of the church the life only come not when sinew and skin was on them but when the wind blowed upon them that's when oh god that's when come back that fourth message of life it was a message what is the message of the hour it's a message of life the fourth was the word itself the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the resurrection sign that christ has finally after justification been planted sanctification been planted baptism of the holy ghost amen notice this organizations has died out and christ has again centered himself amen lock the cap of the pyramid come on church i promise you i'm closing but look at somebody and say we ain't gonna die we're not gonna die come on we ain't gonna die we've been anointed to live we've been prophesied to live we've received a message of life we've received an inspiration what was that first line justification second line sanctification he said third line baptism of the holy ghost he said then the coming of the cap what did he top the breath come in those bones as amen as christ himself coming in the body amen see the holy ghost bunch being honed out so that it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away then when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing in the rapture where the justifier sanctified baptism of the holy ghost that pyramid will stand again oh god the house of god will live again the tree of life is growing again what are you saying preacher i'm saying kick the devil square in the seat of the riches and let him know that spoken word tabernacle is living we're alive we're growing we're breathing we're going to leave here some morning we're going to leave here christ christ himself has stepped into the church into the body the brother said christ the mystery means quicken clicking means made alive his flesh which was his body that's the word it's been laying dead for years but it gradually began to come in the reformation are you ready for this she is standing upon her feet son of man prophesy can these bones live again thou must prophesy again before many kings nations tongues and kings preacher what are you saying i'm saying this you've been inspired to speak the devil has paralyzed your vocal cords long enough you've been crying long enough it's time to speak it's time to speak and it's time to move forward are you hearing me that devil's bound you long enough there's an inspiration in this body it's time to speak and it's time to move forward you're inspired you're inspired to do so you really you got a bob right there sis you realize in that bible there's there's thousands of verses but do you realize that bible was wrote under inspiration you realize that bible wasn't wrote under fear when david wrote i've been forsaken but the lord took me up that was not wrote under fear you know why when you're down and you feel forsaken and you go read that verse you know why something picks you up are you hearing me you know why something encourages you because there's a lingering inspiration over what was wrote so when she reads that if it was wrote under fear then a spirit of fear would come upon her because it was wrote under inspiration faith raises up in her heart you know there was a bible verse amen i'm trying to quit but y'all's pulling there was a bible verse in mark 11 23 when jesus looked at a tree passed by a tree one day and he cursed it and said let it die cursed at the roots and let it die and it dried up died and he said these next words he said like this whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe you receive and you shall have them if you say to this mountain if you say to this mountain be thou removed and don't doubt in your heart that mountain will have to move do you realize the prophet was preaching for years and he said i could not preach on hell because i did not have an understanding he said then i come to mark 11 20 23 24 i never could preach on it he said because i never had an understanding of that he said but then i'm giving you this and he says like this he said then i'm up there on the water fishing thinking on mark 11 and there's a dead fish you know the story speak to the fish little fish gets his life back still saying he don't have understanding goes up to vermont in a meeting couple on the front row making love what are you going to do say the right thing i forgive him walks out forgiven still thinking on mark 11 but cannot preach on it right comes down to kentucky to start to start squirrel hunting indiana kills three squirrels there still thinking on mark 11 but he can't preach on it and he finally tells the lord he says lord if you ever call me to preach on mark 11 here's what i'll say it was six years before the atonement was made so the only thing i can say is it was christ that done it he said then i come down to kentucky to hunt on them squirt to hunt them squirrels is this okay he says i come down there and he said i'm sitting there thinking on mark 11 and he says then he comes down and reminds me who was it that spoke through moses william branham who's speaking through you is it you saying those things he says it's me the lord speaking through you he receives the revelation listen the same inspiration that was up on jesus when he spoke mark 11 was the same inspiration come down upon brother branham to receive the understanding of mark 11. all right now i'm going to close right here he leaves the mountains runs down to the house and he's sitting there and on the other side of the wall sister june is a lady named hattie wright hattie wright is a widow woman she don't have hardly any money brother samuel but she's hearing a prophet speak about the third pull about speaking squirrels into existence and he looks at brother woods and charlie and he says the only thing i can say is he's still jehovah jireh the only thing i can say is he steal jehovah jireh he said hattie wright heard that on the other side of the wall and you know what she said that ain't nothing but the truth are you with me the same inspiration upon jesus to speak it was the same inspiration that came upon brother branham to believe it and to understand it brother lewis was the same inspiration that come up on hattie wright and she said that ain't nothing but the truth he said hattie whatever you ask it'll be given to you right now the healing of your sister shall get up a million dollars it'll come into existence right now whatever you ask hattie whatever you speak is yours and hattie wright looked at him and said brother branham i desire the salvation of my two boys let me leave you with this the reason why the devil don't want inspiration and understanding to come in the church is because when it does the devil loses his hope when inspiration and understanding comes in the church the devil the devil somebody shot the devil loses his hold and brother madam looked at her and said hattie i give you them two boys can we finish the trail of inspiration hattie wright's now come under that same inspiration and she's now received the salvation of her two boys on the other side of the wall was two rebellious teenagers who was laughing at what a prophet of god was saying but when heidi wright said the salvation of my two boys that same inspiration fell upon them two boys and they fell upon their face before god are you hearing the church what are you saying preacher i'm saying open up the door and let the inspiration of the holy ghost come back in the church as our musicians come let the inspiration of god blow again [Applause] let the message of life take possession it's anointed come on church brother andrew you're preaching about the third pool you're exactly right it's on tape the prophet said the lord the same god that identified the first bull is the same one identified the second pool he said but aaron is the same one that has identified the third pull and he says the third pull is here so what he said the third pull is here then what are you saying preacher i'm saying god through this message has restored your voice the authority the inspiration to speak is not laying in a tomb in jeffersonville are you with me the inspiration's still not just hanging up in the mountains of sabino canyon it's not just still down there on the ohio river inspiration is in this building this morning are you hearing me it's your turn young man it's your turn to speak sister june it's your turn brother dale it's your turn buddy it's your turn the devil spoke the devil spoke he spoke a stroke and brother dale spoke healing and he's sitting here this morning y'all just think the devil's gotten black ass for 50 years y'all just wait till he gets back in the pulpit that devil don't know what's on his way are you hearing me there's an inspiration in this message i'm not a crazy man i'm a believer the other day out at byc a young man coming the prayer line while i was i was having a prayer line there the young boy come in the prayer line i had just spoke on mark 11 and told an entire group of young people in the youth camp some of you all might have been there in a youth camp i just preached them on the third pool but andrew that's over their heads no it's in their hearts now let's just listen i'm that close to it might as well not get devil right square in the mouth or brother andrew i don't think we need to preach the deep things to young people well let me just tell you this if they can build computers they can understand the depths of this word hello if they can build websites they can understand the names of this word let's talk stood there and spoke i said that third pulls in you it's time to speak a young boy come up in the prayer line brother joseph come up there had his arms covered in a demon of eczema all over his arms y'all probably saw an exam ex eczema that's what it is eczema big old blisters brother rolled his sleeves up he said andrew look he said they're itching he said they're all swollen and brother something inspiration just come over me brother dale i said then young man you got a voice i said jesus spoke to a tree and it died at the roots i said that same lord jesus is living inside of you he said yes sir i said then i want you to speak to that eczema and i want you to curse it let it and make it dry up in the name of jesus christ he just he looked at it and he said i cursed it i laid my hands on him i said in the name of jesus i joined my faith with him the next night he come in the prayer line brother i thought he was coming to tell me it was still there i thought he was coming for another prayer because he was crying but he got up to me he rolled his arms to sleep he said look brother andrew it's gone the night before it was there but it was gone the next night it's your turn to speak the word is in your mouth it's your turn to speak i didn't know until just the other day amen i was out at jonathan martins i didn't know amen but jonathan maher's daughter was sitting there

the doctor see that or the way do you know how it is something something on you listen we're all human that old devil tried to bring a spirit of fear upon me he said there's a little dark circle what is that that doctor he didn't help much he said well he said i'm not going to say what it what it is he said i don't think it's too much worry about he said but i do think it's something you should get checked out he said i think it is something to be concerned about we left went and preached that meeting saw the supernatural come amen and for months other days she got into a dermatologist into the doctor take a look at it in case you don't believe in doctors go listen to the wings of a snow white dove probably god said i was getting ready to start out on my healing ministry when i finally

scenes of history don't leave this building today without the understanding don't leave this building today without a more clear understanding of who god is of what god is of your purpose in this life

pressure they've been under struggles they've been under strains or that devil of sickness is trying to come to the congregation lord lord an old demon of stroke father has tried to strike our precious brother dale but today dear god we stand here lord we stand here as inspired lord holy ghost-filled people lord we stand here inspired to speak the word lord lord we don't stand here it's just a church father we don't stand here looking upon each other lord as we are in the visible realm but today dear god we stand here lord believe in what a prophet said about us from that unseen realm and today dear god as we join our faith together i say satan in the name of jesus christ thou demon of sickness thou demon of fear thou demon of unbelief thou demon of unbelief in god's word oh hallelujah thou demon that comes and strikes the young people i curse you in the name of jesus christ i curse you upon the authority of god's word this ministry that the prophet has delivered in the bride of jesus christ to curse the very life of the disease now satan i cursed the life of the disease i cursed the life of sin disease i cursed the life of doubt disease i curse the life of reasoning disease and i call for these bones lord i call for these bones to live again lord i call as i stand here today as a new testament preacher lord i prophesy over this church not what i feel not what a sin what a sensation tells me not what an emotion tells me not what a feeling tells me but what your word tells me that life has come in the body and greater works than this how you do he shall stand upon your feet every place the soul of your feet shall tread i have given you for an inheritance and in the name of jesus christ i call for the breath of god to breathe across this congregation satan there's a demon rolling through the land today called coven and it's striking people's breathing it's taking people's breath from them but today's satan i bind you in the name of jesus christ and i say satan that same poisonous breath that you blew across upon the ship that day trying to take the life of our lord and those disciples you've only changed your form and you've come in a form now called coven and you're trying to take the breath out of believers but i curse you satan in the name of jesus christ and i call for the breath of the holy ghost to breathe in the lungs of this church father may you breathe across every preacher may you breathe across our precious pasture may you breathe across for the way may you breathe across these musicians may you breathe across the deacons may you breathe across the trustees breathe across the preachers breathe across the sunday school teachers bring across the lay members breathe across every believer here today until the breath of god amen breathes upon them and they receive the holy ghost they receive a refilling of the holy ghost the dynamics that we've worked in a small measure amen will come in the fullness of its power when the headstone meets with the body and this is the announcement the head and the body have become one then the full power of the holy ghost to lift her off the earth is pulsating in her many member body this morning and we rejoice in it today god we praise you in it today god we bless your name and today father there is none like you we worship you today in the name of jesus christ in the name of jesus christ in the name of jesus christ father i pray for our precious brother tim church today lord father a pastor there in noah missouri lord laying on a hospital bed with a ventilator in his body lord he's been fighting all week to breathe just to stay off that ventilator but today or the other day they had to put him on it but today god i pray the holy ghost would go through that covet unit right now and father may you breathe into that man's body may he breathe into his lungs right now father may you breathe out ever ever covet symptom ever covet term father may you blow it out of him today in the name of jesus christ father i pray for our precious brother wendell today god lord as i just feel burned in my heart right now lord as he leaves today to go to noah missouri to be with brother tim's church and to try to comfort him and to try to try to strengthen them during this time when their pastor is laying on his deathbed in the name of jesus christ i pray the same inspiration that moved across ezekiel would move across that church today and may the words of the message of life may have come in that assembly and may they receive strength to believe when they receive strength to hold on when they receive strength to believe that god can raise up their pastor in the name of jesus christ all the needs in the body we commit them unto you today in the name of jesus christ in the name of jesus christ hallelujah hallelujah can you raise your hand stream right now as we sing it let him breathe into your lungs let him bring this power into you god bless you

how much we appreciate this weekend it's been wonderful we've had a good time we had a real good time yesterday in the youth service and the youth here today and and i'm like brother andrew they if they can if they can build a website they can understand this message if they get the inspiration to build to build a website they can get the inspiration to study this message and and they get the same holy ghost we do it's not a young one it's the same holy ghost and man the holy ghost is not old or young it's the same right and it affects people the way you want it to affect you remember the holy ghost is a gentleman he'll only do what you allow him to do you say no that's god he can do whatever sure but our prophet that he's been talking about for two days our prophet said he was a gentleman the holy ghost was a gentleman he was timid he would he would go out on a limb if you if you did something wrong so we want to invite him in i believe we invited him today i believe he got invited back into some hearts that maybe we're going astray a little bit maybe we're not not feeling the presence of the lord it's good to feel the presence of the lord sometimes it doesn't have to be a shout in good time the presence of the lord when it comes it can give you a calming effect and make you just forget all the other things and know that he's not beside me he's in me hey man so let's
