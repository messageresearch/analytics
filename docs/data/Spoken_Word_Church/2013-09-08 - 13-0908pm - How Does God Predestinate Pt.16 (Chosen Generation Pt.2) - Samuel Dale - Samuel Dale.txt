in the light of your glory foreign holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I won't amen and if we want to see him then he'll make a way won't he 'll make a way he already has good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you like turning your scriptures turn where we read this morning from Romans 8 and then from Ephesians 1. remember the announcements remember the offering that was received today and we certainly will thank you each one will be given to brother Bill Younce is waiting them are taking it up Saturday at a Minister's meeting and just remember them at that time and then remember the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday in Alabama so if you want to ride along with us let us know get everything set up you know and I will be leaving at 10 30 Saturday morning to go so remember these and all the announcements just keep in prayer all of these that are sick you must believe that God sent his word and healed us let's believe it that way and I believe it'll take place don't you amen any other announcements I generally forget something Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this day and thank you that you have given us an opportunity to have our eyes open to that truth we pray that you would just bless now and give understanding ears to each one of our hearts that we may see you Lord and walk in your love forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us Lord grant understanding as we we talk about you we pray that you would just open our eyes in the portion of the word for the day because we realize that it comes just a little at a time to us so we we keep this pressing on to try to minister and to bring what is brought for each day we love you and we thank you guide us now and just have your way with each one of us in Jesus name amen Romans 8. verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are thee called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called him he also justified in whom he justified then he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us and all right Ephesians 1 verse 3. blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the play Praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted were in the Beloved you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now I I know we spent a lot of time on anything and the prophet of God said hold it up until the people see it so then that's you know why I do a lot of things but you know that way you can say at least well we've hatched this whole subject out maybe or something until we've got something out of it but I hope that you're enjoying the part and thoughts of how does God predestinate and we know that he predestinates by his foreknowledge so anything that you're going to deal with predestination you know if you're going to say well I come with this predestinated seed if you're going to say God predestinated me you're going to have to remember that that would be uh to stop at that point of just talking about predestination then you would be cutting yourself short from the point that I'm trying to get us to see and to bring it down to a place of understanding uh the mind of God the things and like I've said many times then if we just if we just go back to where God sat down and talk something out he decided that's where it's going to be well I'm trying to back up more into his mind to see why that things would be done the way the way they're done and good to see brother Howe back there with us you know that he's with us and things and he's going uh this week or the next one to have a pacemaker put in so we my prayers is he won't have to have it I mean I still believe that that's just you know the way I believe it and and I'm just still confessing it that away so just you know pray at the Lord would would touch him and his sister Anna Canard I think is going for a uh and what you call it catheterization this this week so remember that and remember all of these others that are are set up for these things and and all to to be we're all getting older as we do the the doctors gets to making a Better Living that's the only part about getting old is we help out to doctors you know so maybe they're getting getting rich off of us but that's all right I appreciate doctors I believe in them I just don't depend on everything they tell me when God tells me something then I depend upon that but but just remember these the other announcements and all but now we kind of got it to a point this morning and I don't want I know we're not going to have questions and answers this afternoon so hold your questions till Wednesday if you're not planning on being here give them to somebody and let them turn them in because I still have 30 still have about 28 quotes to read so I'm trying to get this into our minds and get one thought now I wrote myself a note I was thinking about it yesterday and I know see people think that I'm preaching to try to contradict somebody else or try to prove somebody else wrong and and that's never been my goal my goal is to understand truth all right and to preach to you the truth to where you can have a choice right right then that way you can listen to somebody else and if you agree with them that's fine with me uh you know I don't have no problems but I don't do it to try to straighten people out you know to show they're wrong really what I do if you think about it my my kind of ministry style has been to take topics that were like Daniel 70 weeks and the seals the godhead the things and predestination is to not try to show how wrong people are but show how wonderful the truth is you know to see how wonderful and the way that God lays out things and speaks it it's it amazes me more every day I look at it just like we were using that scripture there this morning you know that uh if we are The Offspring of God they're in Acts why would we think about God being to godhead being anything else other than what we are you know we're The Offspring well the godhead wouldn't be gold and silver you know image is made it wouldn't have anything to do with those things well I love scripture like that when it opens up to where that I can see it and I'm trying to speak to you the truth not try to show nobody else up wrong because you can't do that anyway you know there's no way you're not going to convince anybody it takes God to reveal there's no man you can't argue you know out argue anybody they'll keep with those same thoughts and ideas and won't do it but just keep that in mind and say well brother Dale you sound like you are we'll pray for me then if I move over into that part you know don't worry about it the holy spirit will start saying lit up you know and I began to let up and go and straighten up you know so you pray for me all right but we're talking about being chosen in him or we titled it for today I told them just to leave the same for this afternoon and put a part two onto it of a chosen generation you know a generation is a race of people a kind a group or a stalker or uh you know uh something that's mourned and we know that we are his offspring there we ended up in the book of Acts all right be in The Offspring of God not being something God made see that's our thoughts if we get tied up into to thinking about well this is the way God made it well I I don't look at it like that I I look at it as what we are we are the people of God and if Jesus wasn't the second person why would we want to think about ourselves as being a second person what a wonderful opportunity to be the children of God and being children of God means we're a very part of him and the way Jesus was was God made manifest in flesh so are we we're the lies we're talking about last night we're the last in morphe the last form of God you know brother martin brother Donnie was talking about where I preached in 1999 on multiple uh forms you know and trying to get us to see the understanding of the godhead well you know we're the life form of God to the Gentile dispensation now you'll go to the Jews and reveal himself but to the Gentiles we're the lies for we're the last God the people are going to say yeah but that is when you say we're God that this shakes me and all that Thrills me you know to know the truth about it and not to run it off into a garbage can but to see that it the Bible said it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his pastor why is it that we would be concerned about trying to get into every other form when we have so much truth to follow and that's all I'm trying to do is preach the truth to you all right now that's just the best I can do and always will try to do all right now now back up a little bit you know and remember we know that he predestinates by his foreknowledge right all right but now we're on back past the point of a predetermining situation back into the part of seeing that we're a part of God the new birth that you have is a part of God not if we was back there as people's identities little spots little little things you know no way we were only his attributes all right then an attribute is a part of him and he has three attributes Father Son and Holy Ghost all right so then we must some way be tied up in those uh thinking of the attributes and the attributes of God are you know the very thoughts of God and and that would make you and I part of that one that would be doing the thinking instead of just something that he thought of that's what I'm wanting us to see when we see that then we're on down the road a little further all right but we ended up this morning talking about chosen in him not chosen of him see if you're chosen of him then he's picking out what he wants and that's predetermining Factor all right but if we're chosen in him then all we got to do is find out how he was in him well as I said we wasn't backed ours people we want little little things running around he wouldn't we wouldn't out fellowshipping with him that's the point if we'd been out fellowshipping with him he would have never brought us down to here right because he would have been having Fellowship he brought us here where the fellowship could be your children are a part of you right but you didn't know him or have any thoughts about him I mean you know did you get together and say okay now honey me and you are going to have three kids we're going to name them Wade and Terence and Anna no no we didn't like I said I'm the 13th so so he'd have to do a whole lot of thinking to get down to that situation all right but now think about it there's a lot of difference in being chosen in him are chosen of him or by him you know a lot of difference in the thought and we should get it to where that we can can uh see our own selves because you know to see who he is all right but then once he began to reveal who he is he is it automatically revealing Who You Are I mean that's an automatic process because you're part of him and not part of another person or doings or whatever all right now we've got down to reading and started off on reading some quotes and uh let's see it seven times I'm pretty certain that he uses the word if we have eternal life there's three times he said if you have eternal life there's when I get 17 times that the prophet said if you've got eternal life or have eternal life all right and each one of those has got the if on it right and that's all I've ever tried to get people to look at to you to look at on one thing and the prophet said you always was eternal look and see what he's saying he said if you have eternal life you always was eternal now it's only used two times about always was eternal I gave it and then the other night I'll get one of them this afternoon I know but one of them is works is Faith Express the other one is things that are to be the only time that brother REM actually uses you always was eternal you know that very statement all right but you just calculate what I gave you that would be somewhere around 46 times that a prophet is asking a question or as I said this morning now you say but that's not a question that's a statement well thank God either way it's right a statement is made because of a situation we're in or whatever and we think about it and brother Joe ran me off the word if you know and uh you know I wouldn't intend to bring it but I'll read what he's got on here see the word if like in Genesis where it says and if thou doest well that word if is a conditional clause a possible situation an impossible situation an oath context it means like no it means weather it means when whenever our sense interrogative particle but rather that's the word the word if mean that's Old Testament Version New Testaments means the word if means accept if not whosoever not means but you know you can say but instead of saying if you know if no before if not unless whoever just a little word if and I'm trying to get you to look at it then as to think about it whether you want it as a question or whether you want it as a statement that dealing with the fact of eternal life the prophet will always you say he'll always be saying if you have eternal life so that puts a situation to me that where there was a time you didn't have it all right then you receive it you have it but then that does no problems with it when he would say you always was eternal if he's talking about us as people look where we're messed up I sure don't feel Eternal today you know 73 I don't feel like Eternal I feel good but not Eternal all right but when you're putting the word if you're questioning the point the if the spirit that was him dwelling you all right see it's putting it to the position that then you're you're you're making a statement like if you have eternal life I can say to you that eternal life you have always was eternal you don't give eternal life to eternal life and see then if you come into the world with eternal life as people are trying to believe within how you're going to get eternal life well I don't need to get it already had it well then you you never was lost you can't make Eternal loss an eternal tied together redeem is to bring us back all right now I haven't got on to that yet so that'll be six months down the road remember to redeem I asked a question one time I said how far back would you like to be redeemed well I want to be redeem back where he predestinated me well then you've done stopped away short from where we are discussing the message see to redeem to me is going to have to be go back to where I was at originally and me as a person was never there originally you wouldn't either but we were the eternal life that we have that's why Redemption comes here we don't have to wait till we go there to be redeemed we're being redeemed now it's coming into being all right now let's read a lot of quotes then and not spend a lot of time commenting but just try to read it and see that each point will be driving it that you and I we were lost doomed and on the way to hell people don't like that see because they want some kind of something to tell them you know all they were I'm a firm believer in the new birth I'm a firm believer and you must be born again and in doing that then that means you were born wrong to start with and that birth will never do you no good but you're born Jesus said from above that's what the original translation says born from above born from where he come from all right see then we're getting to that point of sin so let's start off now let's read a whole lot this afternoon I kind of hollered too much this morning so let's start off with number seven where we were at this morning the god rich in Mercy now all of these except one will be in the 64 6 364-65. all right now what and if you've got eternal life tonight if we have eternal life now this will be that we have the next will be you out then the next will be if you've got eternal life all right then we always were because there's only one form of eternal life we always were and the reason we were because we are a part of God all right now and God is the only thing that's Eternal so now if you're going to believe you come in the world with eternal life you know I'm speaking this out on the internet system if you're going to believe that why don't you believe it correctly you ought to Rejoice about being part of God instead of running it into the flesh all right he goes on to say now we are part of God see now you always was you don't remember because you were only an attribute in God you were only in his thinking only in his thinking an attribute well see I don't want to predestinate myself out of existence I want that eternal life to come this way I'm not trying to go back there go did we go back there we would go back to him being self-existent that's why I said Redemption is here we get our Redemption here we get a change of the body we get the whole thing here we don't have to wait to get to heaven all right go ahead with number eight this will be taken from the Harvest Time 64 12. when there was just him alone talking about eternal and if we have eternal life there is only one form of eternal life and that's God's life for if we have eternal life now there's three times see a question apart so if we have eternal life we were with God right then a part of God but then what does he say we were his attribute now he's explaining it almost every one of these quotes is going to have attribute tied into it or thoughts all right see so if we have eternal life now that's a question about whether we have it or not we have to admit everybody doesn't have it right now if we do then we were with God right then a part of God we were his attribute we are now his attribute and he goes in the beginning with the word so we were his thoughts then expressed into word and become what we are all right attributes okay look at number nine take them to who is Jesus 1964 6 20. the B part and now all is the same same as we are born again we've got eternal life if we have eternal life there is only one form of eternal life that's God's and we are attributes of him where's attributes okay go on 10. Christ is identified 64 4 14 for 15 excuse I got 71. he's Eternal and he's the only source of eternal life there is is in God our Father he's Eternal himself now therefore if we have eternal life we have part of God in us and God in us well that's you know that's just true he's just making a statement like we make right and if he's then that's the only way you could have eternal life is something that was watch this statement now it isn't something that was manufactured then given to you by some Creed are you lived into it you grew into a better man or a better woman it's God himself in you just like you're a part of your father here on Earth you're part of your heavenly father and what you are you've you're the attribute of his thoughts of you before the foundation of the world you've you've expressed he had to breed it in and everything and get what you are to make you what you are then when we was completed then this come on it just goes into another thought go to the next Investments listen to 62 now uh investment 62 11 24. and there's only one thing that ever never had a beginning and that was God and when the Bible speaks there I don't think I'm misquoting it before a great scholar and a great Greek Greek scholar and a Greek man the word Zoe means God's own life then if we how see the reason I'm jumping down from 64 65 to 62 is to keep this we have it appears seven times or eight times then if we have eternal life the Greek word Zoe means that we have part of God's own life because we become a part of him that's simple if you have the new birth you're a child of God right all right because you're part of him there's only one form of eternal life and that's God God is eternal he never did begin and he never can end and the only way you can be Eternal with him is to come part of him and you can't be it till you come part of him all right and the only way that I can be a Son of God is to become part of God then I have to be born of his spirit amen that's it so all your denominational Creeds and invest in eternal life I like that all right going to the next he says number 12. questions and answers in 57 um 0 9 25 wrote it on up to the bottom you read all of these things and read I give them to you like that to where you can have them but you see everything that's perverted has an end to it because it it'll finally must come back to that Purity and Holiness of God and God is eternal and if we have eternal life God is in us and we can no more die than God can die there you are see all of them dealing with what if we all right now jump to the next we'll start back up to 65 221 the evening who is this male charity now you're going to deal with if you have notice those who have tonight eternal life was with him and in him in his thinking before their Ever Was An Angel star cherubim or anything else that's Eternal and if you have eternal life you always want us not your being here but the shape and form of the infinite God did ask him a question there on question and answer we're Spirits or anything he said no you wouldn't nothing you just in his thinking well see then you're going to predestinate Yourself clean out of existence with the doctrines of mankind look at the next one is wisdom versus Faith 62 401. now if you have eternal life today you are in God by God's being in you you are God's expressed out how are you going to be in God by God being in you what is that not the scripture where it says I in you and you and me is that what Jesus said I in you and you and me now we can talk about God coming here but what about in me and you you know I and you and you and me we don't never deal with us being in him we deal try to deal with him coming in US but if we're a part of him look where we are go ahead is your life worthy of the Gospel 63 301 if it's the word and God said so that spirit in you will cope with that word every time cause genuine Holy Spirit Will quote with the word because the word is life and spirit Jesus said my words are life and if you've got now we're up to the you've if you've got eternal life and here's the word how can the word deny the word if you've got eternal life go ahead so now we're dealing on the youth if you've got eternal life identification 64 216. so the life that's in you never did begin and never can end think of it it came in because anything that is eternal ever began the life that's in you never did begin that is if you've got eternal life now you're going to argue with that being a question so go ahead or a statement and that's God for you was in his thought from the beginning see all of it is Basis you get into my point everything is basing upon when he says you're Eternal is basing upon if you have eternal life the eternal life part is what's Eternal all right go to the next one sir as we would see Jesus 1964-301 and if you were in his thinking at the beginning if you got eternal life there is only one form of eternal life eternal life and no beginning it has no ending so if you have eternal life you still questioning right you were an attribute of God's thinking before there was anything but him your form your shape and what you are now is just a negative when you come up to this around 20 when God takes a picture of you all right go on I won't just read these this is taking concerns we would see Jesus 64 318 paragraph 81 82. in the beginning God was not even God he was great Eternal and there was attributes attributes was his thoughts and then he become a word like this in the word express what a thought expressed is a word a word expressed is a thought and then remember if you ever was in God's thinking you'll always be there well because you're part of him if you've got eternal life you are the expression or the attribute of his thought for this age if not you there is only one eternal life and it always existed in you and in his mind existed before there was a world that's the reason he said he chose you before the foundation of the world it isn't what we think what somebody else thinks it's what God eternal it's God Eternal Eternal excuse me God Eternal you always was see in his thinking all right so we were always in his thinking but it's what I've tried to explain to you everybody wasn't always in his thinking like we think about it because his thinking is part of him now Judas was in his thoughts of life right Judas was in his thoughts of what would happen when we come see when we get through this question and answer now you're going to see us start condescending back this way to see what we're doing all right going to the next one oh the voice of the sign there is only one form of eternal life if you've got eternal life then you yourself was in God's thinking before the world was created you're an attribute he was thinking could Eternal never did begin or never can end you're a part of God's economy always it's just reflecting it's becoming now you've got one more picture to develop right that's death then the negative becomes positive and you're in the bride and with Christ as he thought one more to be done we'll skip the bottom one because it's just a reading of saying uh you've got eternal life you were an ordained to be a certain thing maybe a good housewife something else nobody can take your place okay go ahead to the next just reading all of these to where you'll see that everything is tied to an attribute a thought of what you're doing so all right so we're on uh the identified Christ of all ages 64 401 rolling them up how is he is now in you you are his attributes if you've got eternal life your life always was and you was God's thinking the color of higher whatever you are you as God thinking and you're just materialized what brother Dale you're sure they're saying exactly no I'm not saying exactly what everybody else is saying I'm saying a prophet is questioning or a statement either way you want to make it as to a point that we must have eternal life to be able to say we have eternal life we've had to experience receiving eternal life everybody doesn't have eternal life even as we were talking about last night there's going to be people at the white Throne judgment will be given eternal life right foolish virgins Etc you know that they'll never be part of the Bride they can't stay in the city right only those in the city will be the bride and 144 thousand why because the 144 000 received their life here right they don't have to wait till somewhere else or they get their life here so they stay in the city and other people have to go in and out of the city right it all ties together when we see it all right go ahead to the next one this is taken from the Heavenly bridegroom you know the future home as we call it of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride I even like that title you don't hear people expressing that title the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride now are we Earthly no but we're people they asked me a question in life not I'll answer it I'll answer it now they said somebody asked me I said where was God before the world I said I don't have no problem with him being in the future home what do you think I have no problem with him being in the future at home he's building it according to our desires he said yeah but you're making God something tangible something well I thought that's what we're supposed to do I thought he was see no God is just a spirit it's flowing or no he's got it God is a being God ripped the skin off the animals in the garden to pay the price for Adam and Eve he must be pretty physical and brother Branham said to them was Bloody flapping skins on Adam and Eve you see but but brother Dale you're just making God something real I wish I could remember him said we get over there he said angels will beat everywhere because they're real how much more real is God come on Church what do we got a future home look what he says the he's talking about the uh to learn the educated and we'll get back to this statement later again but look what he's talking about the the Pharisees the scholars the things you know he could not recognize it why couldn't those people recognize why no matter how scholarly he was anything like that he still didn't have representation of predestination he didn't have it only the predestinated will be the ones who does it only can be and you only can be can do it because look it proves predestination because if you've got eternal life you had to be a part of God all times because he's the only ones eternal if you've got eternal life go on to the next is taken from the Harvest Time 1964 12. but if you've got eternal life you never did begin and you cannot end because your sons and daughters of God attributes of his thoughts and his word you have no ending of life if your name is on that book come on God who is rich in Mercy 65 119. if you've got eternal life tonight if we have eternal life then we always were because there's only one form of eternal life we always were and the reason we were because we are a part of God and God is the only thing that's Eternal you understand I'm just reading or just read them all to you and let you think about it if we have eternal life that eternal life always existed but there was a day I didn't have it yeah but brother Dale you don't understand I agree with you I don't understand I'm trying go to the next one I want to see you take all these quotes you know I want to see somebody take all these quotes and prove something about me that was eternal before the world as I said this morning that's exactly what we're doing we're taking the quotes that they use to prove that you always was eternal or you come in the world with eternal life thank you I'm taking the same quotes to show what if we come into the world lost but if we have eternal life today then that eternal life always was eternal that's the simple terminology is to me simple thought I don't see why there would be any problem but they are God's power transformation 65 911 Sons and Daughters of sons and daughters were in God at the beginning now look you've got eternal life you say well we believe it that we got eternal life well there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's that's the only thing that is eternal is God and if you've got eternal life that life that's in you always was and you were in the loins of God before there even was the world see if we believe we come in the world with eternal life what's any need of preaching what's he need to preach Jesus dying you say well why would a prophet make that statement we haven't got to that yet we're going to get down into some more Thoughts with it he's certainly not trying to show us that we don't need Calvary that we don't need salvation that we don't need to receive Jesus Christ as our savior would you realize what people are doing the pastors of these churches and I they're putting that into the congregation's mind and they're not going to seek the Lord that's the old Baptist two seeds in the spirit don't try to get them saved God is going to save them anyway look at the next one this is taken from thirst 1965 919. now remember if you've got eternal life your life was in God at the beginning and the life God is the word and then when the word was made flesh in Jesus Christ God coming down to dwell in his own body made himself the Son of God when God came down to dwell in that you were in him when he was crucified okay now do you believe that how many statements do you need of that form that we walked in Minnesota Galilee we died in him he went to hell in my place Etc I want to ask you a simple question then if we were in him as he died was crucified then are you saying that he started some way right there from then on dropping a seed into people that would eventually turn out to be an eternal life because maybe you didn't catch what I said this morning the prophet said there was a speck or a spot or he'll call it of eternal life I'm talking about a person of eternal life there's a vast difference in a spot in a person but if we were in him when he was crucified now what was in him what part of us was in him everybody else wants to make him come over put something in US spots you know I'm doing this whatever but if we were in him what were we when we were in him are you listening some of you are getting catching on a little bit ain't you what were we when we were in him now you say well we were these little little dots and spots that they want to draw out and make a picture oh look at that that's you that right there Danny that was kind of got his head turned up to her kind of looked a little you know odd but we was in him when he was crucified now what part of us was in him when he was crucified I'm waiting on an answer from somebody the only way we could be in him would be his wages stated to be a part of that eternal life that was in him you see that I'm concerned about what I was in him and then tied it all the way back to the beginning I find out that if I have eternal life the eternal life that was released from him and this is one you can't answer ain't no need in trying it you say well you're sure sarcastic well will I finish the statement and see where were we in him you know that the Holy Spirit had already left the body the soul of God had left the body and it was hanging on a tree right you with me the bride was still in his side are you with me spear went into his side to show what he'd done died of a broken heart water and blood came out of his side the prophet said that was when the bride was released now I don't know the answer to that one I want somebody to answer that for me the Holy Spirit stole everything was done gone but the bride was still in his body there are some statements that can't be explained the spear brought out the blood the water and it brought the bride out I mean do you understand I'm asking you a question I love questions what part of him would we what part were we with eternal life but you know what came out of him was the bride now I'm going to State what I believe I said I can't answer well State what I believe I believe that word was still in him and that Spirit went inside the blood and the water came out because that's what Jesus was talking about when he was talking to Nicodemus he said you've got to be born of what that's what he said to Nicodemus you've got to be born to water and blood the two elements that was left in his body all right now the answer to me is that eternal life that left out of him was the Eternal God but the word and the spirit was still in a place that needed that problem and may I go on a little farther brother Brown said there was 120. Little Seeds words drawn back up in the upper room this is all spoken word original seat waiting on the spirit to bring it life so we better be worried about justification water sanctification blood and life of eternal life the new birth we better believe the new birth all right let's get to that point if we were crucified in here if you were crucified with him and you died with him on Calvary you was buried with him on the mountain and you Rose with him on Easter morning and now you're sitting together in Heavenly places in him and now you've got fellowship with him the same eternal life that Jesus Christ had is living In You and I by the new birth but you got to come by the water and the blood to get your eternal life okay going to the next this is the message I've heard but now I see 65 11 27. but through a betting ground of your mother you were made manifest in his likeness talk about being a gene German your father Etc and then he could talk to you the god the great God if you got eternal life then the germ of eternal life was in God at the beginning and you were there you were in his thinking your name and all and he by foreknowledge ordained you to see this in you that was not ordained will never see it so that's the way I want to see it don't you look at the next the right excuse me the rapture 65. um 1204. now so you were in you so were you in if you got eternal life you were in God before there was a world and you are a part of God a Son of God an attribute of God he know the very age you were coming he predestinated you to that age now we're good to that that'll be a couple of messages later how that he could look down through and see you and he did predestinate you by his foreknowledge to be what you are all right look to the next we only got a few more we'll this is taken from the messiest things there ought to be 1205 65. go ahead and roll it up wherever you are God knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you ever if you've got eternal life then it always was eternal life and God before there was a foundation World knew that you would be here and when the word or the water the washing of the water of the word fell upon you you it was expressed in a being now you have fellowship with your father God just as you have with your Earthly father going to the next trying to read Feist life preached in 1958 now we drop down all right showing that he was teaching this back there people say he changed his Doctrine as he come along and he kept gaining ground well let's see now there's life there's one kind of eternal life and that's God's life and he when you receive that you have eternal life but life has many interpretations as it comes down now here's what people say that he changed the they say he believed back there in receiving eternal life you know Newburgh but when he got into the 63 4-5 did he believed you always was eternal now I'd like to see that in writing from him that's your concept of what you think that he progressed I'd like to see his statements on it all right and his life had no beginning and it'll have no ending and if you've got eternal life then you have no end to eternal life it's forever in your character is proven by the life that's in you whatever we do with it will prove the life of it right going to the next 1959 707 bombing Gilead listen to you all of you hear me on the day of Pentecost when these people had received the new birth and had received eternal life you know of course he changed his way of doing later you know come on I don't if you got eternal life in you you can demonstrate eternal life you abstain from the things of the world going to the next holy God just a few more all right this is taken from uh questions and answers on the Holy Ghost 1959 12 19. so roll it on up for you has got eternal life but you believe but we believe if you've got eternal life if God has give you eternal life you got it forever that's what I believe that if God has given you eternal life he's given me eternal I've got it forever and then it's just as Eternal as him so that was part of him in the beginning but I must receive it let's read the rest of them give me these are a little bit added to this is from the message Souls that are are in prison now 63 11 10. but the soul that's in Darcy that soul is what God is working on see if he can only get that nature that Spirit to agree with him then that nature dies the nature and the love of the world dies and the things of the world is dead let me stop for a second you know that a seed ain't worth nothing until it dies right seed seed ain't worth a thing till it dies okay and the things of the world is dead see because if you love the world of the things of the world the love of God is not in you see and a man must be born again so this Nature has to die and the nature of the world comes and excuse me nature of God comes and lives in you and God is the only thing that thing there is that never did begin or never can end go ahead to the next this is the token 64 201 208 when he said you must be born again now remember this is up in there where the souls in prison we just read and this one is up into the point where they say changed all this don't sound much like it when he said you must be born again that don't mean jump up and down after altar that don't mean walk back there and shake hands with a pastor that don't mean all this foolishness that we've seen done it don't mean putting your name on a church book it means Death to Your First being and life to the second being it means that the blood has been applied and you've identified by the life of Jesus Christ and if he be the vine and we be the branches and the life that's in the branch is in also from Divine it'll fire the fruit all right well the life in the vine and the branches has got to be the same you understand well I know the branch buys the fruit the vine is is produces the life but it's got to be the same all right one or two more this is taken from Georgia to real three which is 64 404 but if God said so that makes it so there ain't no surely to it you must be born again you got to receive the Holy Ghost either that or perish now so you got a choice that's in 64. those lies three or four was reading of the 64 3 and 4. in word of people say he changed his Doctrine he come up with a new doctrine a new idea well I'd like to know where he said he changed it at because on the message the future home he said I taught three processes ever since I was a boy future home was preached in 64. he never changed his Doctrine he just lost mankind when he began to talk about eternal life he lost mankind when he began to talk about the eternal life that you have is a part of God and that means that you are God made manifest that's where he lost mankind that's where he's lost the people in their doctrines and ideas he was not trying to say we didn't need to be saved he was trying to tell us the day you receive eternal life that eternal life always was eternal now can I quote the scripture that we read over and over 16 times now those who he justified he's already sanctified those who he sanctified he's already glorified so when we receive eternal life that soul is just as Eternal as it'll ever be that has nothing to do with growth development understanding and you know doing that that has to do with eternal life and what you don't believe brother we come here with a spot in us I believe a lot of things that we'll get to I believe one that I just covered a few weeks ago that you and I I'm not going to bring that one because it got down so he didn't want it you and I have the opportunity to receive the greatest message that has ever been to explain eternal life to explain the children of God and Who We Are and to see brother Marlo what we are we're the life form of God in this dispensation and being that we have eternal life we were truly then chosen in him we are truly then a royal priesthood a chosen generation of peculiar people because we're his children you know that we have many titles you know we talk about him with titles come ahead Brothers get ready we have many we talk about him having many titles you know that we have many titles we're his children we're his offspring we're his wife we're his bride and many more can you name just off the top of your head we have many manifestations to ourselves just as he has many manifestations we're a royal priesthood whereas once a priest was over his house or you know or things you know that Daddy was the thing now every one of us have access to go before the Throne of God you don't have to call me up say brother Dale pray for him that's wonderful that's good you know because we have the opportunity for ourselves sometimes I admit sometimes I get the feeling so bad I wish somebody would pray for me because I don't feel good enough to even pray for the South maybe you ain't never felt that bad but you know you get the feeling so bad you don't even know how to pray you want somebody to come along pray for you but then we read a quote this morning that I hope would start bear with you brother Mark if we have eternal life and that's life living in us which is God's own life then who's asking for the healing of these bodies he don't want to be in a sick body right that's why my wife years ago said look at her said no wonder then we can ask it's called it's a father in us doing the ask and that's what the scripture says the father do it the speaking don't be concerned what you're going to say the Father doeth the speaking is God in us asking to be delivered from these things because he's not satisfied in a sick body he's not satisfied in an old body you know why I know that because he's fixing to change these amen eternal life why didn't one more question if we're born with this seed in us and all these things when that seed come to life and everybody wants to make it even a little woman at the whale or whoever Why didn't it change these bodies I said I love questions but I like to ask them even when the disciples received eternal life on the dead Pentecost Why didn't it change their bodies it quickened them brought him into a position for living for Christ yeah but it never gave their bodies eternal life why not if eternal life is just throwing it out and just you know some spot some thought and I believe eternal life is a person and we're going to get down to this seed and always talk about where it wrote around and said there's a seed for every age and somebody's got to make that live you and I have a seed to make live folks and that seed is not to just realize that brother Branham was a prophet that's age and time is dire some people are just now receiving that that's the age and time to seed but to those who walk in the word it's like I told the brothers years ago and they even wrote back from it I said sure we're going to these countries you go there and you you you get them to the message but the next year you don't go back and tell them all about the message you know the messenger you tell them the message well they sent word from a country over there and said we've heard that right around as a prophet now come and teach us what he said eternal life is a person let's stand give you a short afternoon man it ain't even 3 30 yet questions and answers on Wednesday write them down and then hand them to me and let me think about it a little because I believe in it what we got for it to the Lord I don't know I would be nice brother want the park laws pacemaker put in that everything will be all right he said I've seen God to heal he's been healed of many things I'm taken yesterday uh today too brother Richard Wilson I'm talking to him about it he's got a kidney stone so pray for him you pray for him because you know you had it years ago Brothers Thomas told it he had a kidney stone that it was impossible it was somewhat large it was impossible to pass doctor said you might as well get ready we gotta operate he called the doctor up in another another day or something he said doc said you still think I came I said kidney stone he said there's no way it's too large he said I got it here in my hand he said we went to the church and we prayed and said God no you know what the doctor said he said don't tell nobody about that how do I lose a lot of patience we believe that we've seen God heal so let's believe that brother right father in the name of Jesus Christ we lay our hands upon our brother believing that by your stripes he's healed and we're going to believe that you don't have to have this operation well this the pacemaker put in because we've seen you If You Are the Healer deliver you are the one that I spoke of all of these days Eternal and then it's not me asking forever God is in the your stripes Lord in Jesus name Never Gonna Give You a bullet put me in there because his father in the name of Jesus Christ Lord of these things that make all things we love you and we thank you and we get that medicine we are sanctified pray over your food don't want you forever oh man perfect love you anymore everything's gonna be all right there won't be any problem and then she's asking for The Neighbors that you would in Jesus Christ well let's just believe let's believe that everything will be all right father in the name of Jesus Christ we lay our hands upon our sister because she's asking you to touch this person you brought into her attention now Lord we send the Holy Spirit there to take care of that person and we believe it in Jesus name amen anybody else would just like to come and let's see doing it foreign anybody else it's coming let's see he's real working God we got a miracle working God right we have Bible verse we have a miracle working again amen we have a miracle working God we have a wonderful working God he really loves to do miracles to prove it too the problem is us we stopped him everything starts going right and it works out and then we just but I wonder see just don't worry about it just commit it to him everything right on time right father we thank you for this day and we ask you that you just help us to understand and Lord helping people that would hear that we're not trying to argue with nobody because there's no argument ever settled anything Lord but we're just trying to look right straight into your word and realize realization we believe what the prophet has said unto us but we just know for sure did it the people must be born again before they have eternal life and in doing that then we can only have it by representation of a predestination until that time comes Lord you can call it a spot you can call it anything you want to but it's still not real until it becomes a reality in our hearts and lives we love you and we thank you we ask you to go with each one big take care of everybody on the highway give us all a safe journey home lie to each one in Jesus name introduce me as pray one for another day baby believe me please
