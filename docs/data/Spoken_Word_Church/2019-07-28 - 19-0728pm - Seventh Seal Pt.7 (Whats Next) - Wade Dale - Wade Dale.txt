look around see them in the word and you see them in the people but we love more than anything be able to see him in people man good to be in the house Lord good to be back everything went well we all did great everything was fine Delta decided to keep my luggage for a little while but that's okay one of the when we were preaching on adoption while we were out there and we are telling a son school class we don't nobody trip over there I've never been to a meeting and not saying I had anything to do with it or but I did I was there God used us but I've never seen three preachers that didn't know more than sit down we didn't brother Joel Brown and brother Darrell Ward and myself the three days we preached that's all Richard it's just that and if you would have scripted it you couldn't have scripted it any better then brother Joel Brown starting with just a simple simple sermon and brother Darrell Ward best I'd ever heard him preach on the very same line and we never discussed it one time and then we came in Sunday and and tried to put a put a lid on it put a cap on it so people can understand and they were really we're amazed but you know what we're not amazed at God that's what he does he does that anyway does it all the time I was thinking you know you we limit God to a lot of things Friday before last when we left to go June and I left it like it's almost 7 o'clock in the morning our flight was at 11:00 but you know what Atlanta traffic is from 7 o'clock to about 9 o'clock everybody in here is either have been stuck in it or have been a part of it right never hit my brakes one time till we got in the airport right phenomenal at the amount of no traffic zero now Friday this week I was listening on the radio traffic jam downtown rec on 285 rec near the airport traffic bags up hour and a half to two hours I think God before the foundation of the world you told those people not to go where the will they usually go life's Friday but you let them go this Friday you say you God can't we mean God can't do that God orchestrated the whole thing it wasn't it what man cuz I'm telling you it was phenomenal has no traffic between 7:00 we left it seven o'clock driving into Atlanta you know how they're around Jimmy Carter and all starts cramming up and know gone right down to the airport now when we got in the airport the devil was there as soon as we walked in the door the delta ticket line of course we'd already checked him but we had to check in the baggage it was backed up all the way into the carousel but still we still got through everything was great and fine so we think God for that so but but I did I thought man how many times have you been somewhere though and you just ask God to help you and you just zoom right in and then the next few days you look and you go man what a traffic jam that place is down there hmm well see there there was two of us that needed some help so God gave us a double blessing because I'm telling you usually you're hitting your brakes and slowing down but we were right on into the airport and God blessed us like I said we had three good services and the Lord really really showed us some things and they had some real good fellowship so god bless you thank you for thank you for loaning me out to them so brother Chris and just join us to tell you hello and god bless you and they're coming out here sometime in October but he's definitely coming to preach for us to watch night service so just keep him in your prayers just remember all these other ones it'll be it'll be awhile before we speak anymore till about September so Lord bless him we got in September we got Matthew Braves coming to second weekend or first weekend in September so we're gonna be on vacation for a little while but we'll still we'll still be working so god bless you let's turn our Bibles to the Book of Revelations 8 verse 1 today we're gonna speak on the seventh seal part 7 what is next ok everybody wants to know what is next well you know why we don't have to wait till tomorrow to get the newspaper we've already read the newspaper we already know what's going to happen but we want to be made aware of what's fixing to happen because we don't know everything but God's give us a God give us a message and he gave us a prophet and he gave us the Holy Ghost to what lead us and guide us into all truth not some truth he said he would do that into all truth so we thank God for that so let's bow our heads before we get started the Heavenly Father thank you for this day thank you for this great word that we're sitting under Lord that you give us an opportunity to even hear what prophets down through the ages and many many Christian people down through time has wanted to stand in this moment and Lord here we are Lord we stand here at the end of all things the end of time for the Gentile church and we thank you Father that you give a spiritual insight you've give us Lord tomorrow's news we've already read the the paper Lord and we we know that that we win but there's a journey that we have to go through called life and as brother Dale is talking we have to we have to grow up we have to grow up in garden we have to grow up spiritually father I pray that you would help us today to do that father you be the active participant the one do the speaking the one do the hearing and the one doing the revealing father bless the sick ones that are not here the ones Lord that need help we pray this you would bless them lift them up in their spirit father bless each one of us as we stand today father just a bunch of needy people but Lord you said you'd provide all of our needs Lord I pray that you'd be with us and take care of us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus name we pray amen revelations 8:1 and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour Ephesians 4:30 says in grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption you may be seated in the Lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now as we get started I want us to this will probably as we were we're talking this week this last weekend there were I told him Sunday morning I said this is one meeting that I'll promise you one thing all three preachers were in their right mind we were all left handed well the Darrell Ward myself I didn't know brother Joel Brown was but when he started writing things down and and being a lefty I know the mannerisms of a left-handed person so I know I knew that he was so I got up Sunday morning I said do you know one thing's for sure we were all in our right mind when we were speaking to you this weekend so I hope we're all still in our right mind anyway man God's not left-brained or right-brained he is the brain but that was kind of funny they were all three all three of us were left-handed preachers so but we look in this book of revelations we're coming to the end of something but like I said before when we come to the end of something with God it's not the end as man thinks the end because man has four years and thousands of years has looked at the end of the world the end of time the end you see all these movies and things about the end time and the end the end you know what that is the end for the but it's just the beginning for a Christian it's just the part that you and I have to realize that we're set here in time to do something but this is really this is just part of what we're doing we're going to something much greater and much more and it's always eternal because this of God a man we're standing here in this in this time element and truly it is a struggle we try to survive we try to do the best with Canada I we were talking about this past weekend you know it's it's hard on people in people that and sometimes we make it hard on yourself amen we make it hard on ourselves you don't do what God wants us to do but you know what if you come back if you like brother Dale was talking about being back slid listen if you can't you're not back slid if you're lost you're lost because the prodigal son was a son he was born a son he just went wayward a little way and then he came back but he was a son and that's the way you and I are we look at these things and we think boy these people are just no give them time God give you time so let's give them time all these people that are on this wall I pray every every time I stand over there and pray there's a wall right here at my Sunday School class full of people that have not come to the Lord you remember we put them all on the wall let's don't forget those those people need salvation so we look at this wall and we see this wall of people that needs to be some of those needs to be struck off because they need to be here and then they need to be brought back to the Lord and you know what they willing in the time because remember God has the most patience of anybody I know because he's already solved that how in the world if we saw the end from the beginning we'd want to hurry up and get to the end because we're gonna be living in a glorious time but we got to see all this other other stuff that's going on and we look when we see the seals I want to kind of one more time I'm not going to draw much as far as the church ages we should already know we're in the last church age we should already know we're in the last message that the Gentile church is going to get oh there's no big message preacher gonna jump up here and be the final voice to the Gentile age we've already had that we have already had now what we're doing is is we're breaking down and and helping helping being servants we're helping everybody kind of get in the right channel so we can get out of here because I believe God does use the fivefold ministry to bring the people to a place so you can see who you are not who I see who you are that you see who you are when the bride realizes who she is and what she's doing here bride realizes who she is not preacher's bride realizes who she is and what they're doing here they'll be an invincible army all right so we're cut where I think we're coming to that place all right I just do I believe we're coming to that place so let's read this just what we've read these quotes before but I saw a little more maybe low on it this weekend this past weekend was it was a wonderful weekend just um you know I'm all over the things that that was that was preached there and like I said I enjoyed them the brothers really did a really good job but we were all speaking pretty much on adoption they didn't call it adoption but you can call it whatever you want to view preaching in the same line you get the people in that same attitude then you see that everybody needs to grow some are going to grow different some are going to grow bigger some are going to grow look at Michael how can you not look at Michael he's 6 foot 800 I remember when he was a little big child mm-hmm I wasn't gonna say baby but he was you were the baby but I look at him now good grief he's what 6 5 6 7 8 9 he's still growing why because he's God Jean in him to grow with his genetic makeup is a little bit different than mine because mine got me at about 511 and that's about it stuck there about going in further same way with garden the only thing is is you and I boy don't do that you and I don't you think I see what's going on back there Boyd's going put his name down take your name but we do all grow in different stages we all have different growth spurts because we're human same way in the gospel and as we were talking downstairs and we were talking this past weekend you can stunt your growth you can do that yourself that is a free moral agent is helped me more than anything you can make yourself available for the word or you cannot okay it's just it's up to you and like brother Dale said this morning being being in being a born-again Christian that puts you in the body and puts you in line for all these things but you can stop it at any moment you can quit eating and when you quit eating what happens you stunt your growth you don't become not a human you become a mountain erst human you become somebody that you look at all these and I hate to see that overseas they see the little children and all their their growth being studied because what they don't get the nutrition all right they don't get the nutrition if they don't get the nutrition they don't get the nutrition then even a young Christian can what just drop and sit there and just not die not die but be so malnourished you don't know what you're missing but oh what about a bunch of vitamins somebody comes from over here and goes over there to a little country in Africa and take some good food and good water and good vitamins why you see the kids just start growing and they're more happy you now would be more happy the more we get closer to God we should be more happy and then so you say you look at these seals and you think well I hope like brother Bob said a couple weeks ago I hope that we tried to make this so simple that it's really so simple some people are waiting for this great big moment the great crescendo you know of the ending of the story or it's already here it's already here you're living it I already said it's Christ in you the hope of glory and I'm the the others really enjoyed cuz I really hung on Sunday after Sunday morning about all these things that we as message believers have thought when when this happens this will happen when California sinks this is happening when when this happens this happened listen all that external stuff president woman in the White House we get all these quotes and we start quoting them we've been wrong we have been 50 years wrong brother Dale said it today it comes from right here no one will lay hands on you to take a body change I know it's going to come from what you got already inside of you a man so it's going to come from within nothing external is going to cause you listen if California leaven I'm a little bit off the subject now may be a little long today so just get with it on 9/11 after 9/11 what happened churches filled up right day of prayer when they think don't even for Kenny and praying school day oppression all day of prayer it all become why because of the disaster something happened you and I are not that way Christians do not react to a disaster because you ain't a Christian if you have to wait till something happens hello if you have to wait till something well we're waiting on waiting on what brother Brown said waiting on you and I adoption time I read that quote Sunday God's waiting on you and I adoption time where God can pour into us his fullness and like I've always said before Dwight Moody said God will fill those who are not full of their self amen so that's our problem we've been so full of ourselves we ain't letting God do his work well let God work his way out so let's look at this just for a minute the subject is what is next let's just kind of background a little bit and let's just see let's go to number one we've read it before but this is the whole basis of the seals because he breaks the seals number one he breaks the seals reveals gives us his inheritance to his people now let me ask you a question what is redemption redemption is not replacement right redemption is something has fallen to a position and then God's going to bring it back listen man can't bring it back God will bring it back you know why because I like what brother Darrell Ward didn't he he took a piece of paper and and see that that piece of paper is eternal this is eternal life if you can make it just look just go with me this is the eternal life okay you show it's got a beginning and SEP forget it this is an example okay this is eternal you can't make eternal here or here or here eternal has to stay the way it is right but now what happened in the Garden of Eden and the Garden of Eden to get this plan of redemption because you know what God saw the plan of redemption before the foundation of the world knew how he was going to save every one of us in you who would be saved and who wouldn't but now remember that wasn't that wasn't put into place until it happens on earth God can think about it in his mind but he had to materialize remember we he stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world our names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life why didn't we just go right straight into the future home because it had to be a plan of redemption so God had to redeem us back to be the savior the healer the Redeemer but in the Garden of Eden what happened Adam didn't lose eternal life right he lost his fellow chef's eternal still eternal doesn't matter anyway you you take this eternal is eternal now what is redemption it's bringing it back to here not here not here the matching pieces he was preaching matching pieces and ginger leaned over and she said he's preaching matching pieces that your daddy preached in 1995 but what he was talking about because remember Adam didn't lose his eternal life he was the son of God he lost his ability to continue on in eternal life but this man right here what does the inheritance he gave us he gave us an inheritance that we never had and that's eternal life in our body he turtles always eternal and remember one thing's for sure if you're a part of this you got to be a part of this doesn't matter how you pull it apart it's like I said told them Sunday I used this analogy a little bit more I said now look brother Daryl didn't take this and throw this down and say now this is Redemption that's not redemption because Redemption is putting it back together eternal to eternal so now the problem is is we lost our fellowship Eternals always stayed eternal and this is Christ this is this is who every just is Jesus Christ this is Christ this is the this is the Alpha Omega the beginning in the end the Savior the healer the redeemer put it all in this but it goes right back to one word that's eternal we fell from eternal life now there's 6,000 years of a gap amen but when we realize who we are and what we're doing here this is what we're doing we're trying to put this back together this together humanity human I came from God and I'm going back to God when the bride begins to say I and my father are one and these other things the shucker pull away that's what our problem is we've been either like this or like this or totally something different you can't vulcanize you can only vulcanized rubber to rubber that's what our thought is is we weren't well by the way we're not rubber I'm just telling you what God said I'm just telling you what God said when when brother Brown said I and my father 1 and these other things the shucker pull away why are you bringing him back together it took Christ to come Jesus Christ to come though and remember he's the only seal grieve not the Holy Spirit of God where you swear by you are sealed unto the day of redemption there's only one seal to be broken that's that seventh seal which is the whole plan of redemption because like brother Dale says once you get born again your plan of redemption is complete but you still got a growth development to come to if you want to continue on those who he's justified he has already glorified listen at Calvary God put the pieces back together remember brother Brahm said he said your body was redeemed Israel was redeemed at Calvary but it has not been applied yet so we're down here in time trying to apply it back to where we go back to eternal comes remember if your soul is eternal then what part of eternal isn't on this piece of paper it's the paper with no tear it's the paper so what does the seals do the seals didn't bring eternal life back to the people not in their soul not as the new birth the new birth would from acts 2:38 Iraq's two before x2 38 Kalu's acts to write eternal life coming back into the soul of man was preached and redemption was in the process all through the six Church ages but they couldn't come to that last little part that you're at now that your spirit can be clean and that your body can be clean your body is what we're listen the only part of you that's eternal is your soul but you know what brother Branham said if Adam had not to fail what would happen his body would have been made eternal it would have been the whole three parts body spirit and soul does that listen because that's what we're going back to right redemption is not replacement redemptions not replacement and redemption is not this it's dry hair he's putting the pieces back together he saw us before the foundation of the world completely totally redeemed the whole plan everybody that was going to be in it he saw a vision we were talking about this morning Bibles in Sunday school he saw a vision now that vision has got to be complete because like I told him downstairs brother Darrell Ward was we were talking about this and and he brought out a quote where brother Branham said he's talking about you know seeing a vision and how how he brother Branham had faith in that vision brother Branham he reached the quote he says lady your name is sister I Isabella del mundo and I see you live at one forty two and a half Street now working with the post office you can't guess that because working for the post office if you only have half numbers it means there's one driveway and like two units of an apartment sitting here one's 142 and one's 142 and a half he was literally looking at that woman's address on the door he wasn't guessing that and he said I see you inside your house sitting on a bed groaning with a headache now what's brother branham doing he is seeing I told him this morning you know brother Branham was the greatest scientist that ever lived he had high definition television way before way before man did I don't think he saw that vision in black and white no he said your eyes are blue you got on the green shirt you drive a red car your house is painted red or blue or green he tells him why because God was showing him the vision either that had already happened or that was fixing to have memory told brother build now he said I see me and you shaking hands in front of the tabernacle you will rise up from the bed you see how that is that you say well boy that's wonderful it is great but that was all temporary the real vision is what God had of us that will never go away before the foundation world what we're trying to do now is get you to see that vision that God's already seen up here in his mind and now it's being transformed down here you say brother wait where are you going with this all right let's go to the breach because these seals like I said before you can make a list that will not fit on this page of what people spot the seals worth if you've been in the message long enough you've heard some of them it's been this and that and the other what it's all been external some man hmm some building some doctrine someplace you got to be some they made it everything but what it's supposed to be and that's Christ in you crocks doing the work through you because listen the plan of redemption is not for trees and cars and houses and plants the plan of redemption is for me and you and then everything under that comes up amen because when Adam fell the whole nature fell Romans eight brother Dale has been reading Romans eight the whole world is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God why because that son of God let him down in the beginning amen Adam had to start fending for himself amen but here you and I are coming every mystery of the Bible each one of these seals the whole thing together the whole mystery lays writing these seals every mystery of the Bible lays in these seals and the seals cannot be broken until that time now remember it's a book of redemption keep going all the way down to the bottom from Genesis to Revelation so now we've started where it broke from the break came in Genesis the real the actuality is when Adam sold the human race and it split us apart and then but now in Revelations we see it come back together Amen well we'll get a little thought on that in just a minute from Genesis to revelations a complete plan of redemption is revealed in these seven seals oh it's an important time God help us to get it now remember in the opening of the seals it's even going through the seals it shows your redemption to my Redemption but it always also shows the redemption of Israel the fifth seals you the sixth seal sanctification of the earth and that's going into the Millennium amen and then the seventh seal is we always got one quote it's revealing Christ all right so now let's go to the next go to the next quote let's get to a place right here just hold that thought just for a second so now what is redemption redemption is not replacement right redemption is not replacement a complete plan of redemption is revealed in the seventh seal so everything we need to change our body is in those opening of the seven seals but now it's the process like I said before it would be real easy for us to just say I'm born again boom I'm changed oh mile that would be simple but you know what it wouldn't be a journey it wouldn't be it wouldn't be a plan of redemption it wouldn't be a plan hey brother Brown said in constant mystery God revealed that Christ God had a what a plan and a purpose and he was going to CC you and I can make a plan and a purpose and sometimes they don't come together but I'll promise you God's thoughts are eternal whatever pops in his brain it will happen amen and nothing will pop into his brain that's not going to come to pass and then because he's got he knows all things what a great God we serve but it's not replacement so now what happened when God comes to a place where he comes down to earth and Jesus therefore received the vinegar and said it is finished he bowed his head and gave up the ghost he preached three-and-a-half years the whole plan of redemption is preached in those three and a half years that he was on the earth amen now we see all the other things of the Old Testament Saints and the different ones but geez it's all connected to that one man Jesus Christ it's all connected to him his if he didn't come you can forget the rest of it you can forget any of it because he was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world all right so now when Jesus came he bowed his head and gave up the ghost I told you we'd get to it finally but what happened there was silence he really didn't preach any more he even told Pilate he said anything say in other words Pilate kept saying are you the Christ and he said you say are you this he's did you say he never preached him another long sermon now when he came back after he took a death bearing resurrection he came back and all he done was just told him where to go and what would happen go into all the world preach the gospel baptizing in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost that's what he told him then he was it was gone he didn't do it that wasn't a lot of preaching left amen so we look and see that we think that we say well the devil well world world says the devil silenced him but no he had just started his work because his real work was not him himself being on earth he came here for you he came here to release that life called Christ read it right here next quote number three hmm surviving in the Sun he is the one who opened those seals so remember he opened the seals he is those seals for the whole Word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was open what is the opening of seals then revealing Christ and as I said before where is Christ he's in you we don't have Jesus Christ walking around on earth today the people can point and say there's Christ he disappeared 2,000 years ago he said the world will see me no more but you'll see me cuz I'll be with you and in you to the end the age or the end of the world amen so see that's to me like brother nails always said Jesus preached six seals so this so the seals have been open have been preached except for number seven number seven though is when you get a revelation of who Jesus Christ is and where he is and where he is there's your seventh seal that's the one seal grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption because remember we're going to read this scripture in a minute in Matthew where he says about Christ being over here and being over here we read it before we're gonna read it again but let's see what we have feeling Christ all right let's go to the next one the Greek lexicon tells us that Christ means anointed was the Messiah the Son of God now we know for a fact he was the son of man the Son of God lived in him but were they weird the ones that got the revelation okay mm-hmm to anoint consecrating Jesus to the Masonic office and furnishing him with the necessary powers for US administration now listen Romans 8 tells us we're heirs and joint heirs with Christ I want some class participation y'all can sleep tonight good grief people come on try just try to stay awake pinch yourself let some hounds pinch you that'll really make you mad maybe keep you up though Christ means annoying wasn't Messala some God now we know he was a son of man couldn't go all the way up so if Jesus was given brother Brahim told us we were little Messiah see we had a we had a man come that I was telling him Sunday I got a new pair of binoculars my old pair was 8 by 30 which means 8 magnification with a 30 millimeter lens which is the lens about that big you're limited to that but you can see man's had a binocular the whole time and see remember with binoculars you see one you look through two and you see one so I got some the other day I upgraded my revelation I got some 10 by 40 twos that means that's magnified ten times with the 42 millimeter lens which brings more light in and I can see ten times what I could usually just see eight times you and I have got this unlimited sight now I'm telling you yeah but you know what though is best of a binocular you can buy oh you people know this look through binoculars doesn't matter how good you can pay two thousand dollars for for a pair of binoculars if you move it just one little click right brother Danny you can see images but you don't see clarity my brother branham coming and giving us clarity didn't change the Word of God he gave us clarity of what's already been told us he turned out binocular just enough to where we can see now in the high definition we're in the denominational world and the different people even Luther Wesley even Paul says I look through a glass now what's the binocular made out of glass I see through a glass darkly why he was a prophet he could see things but he couldn't see the clarity now we got brother Branham walks up he tells a lady he said I see you in your home it's 142 and a half so so Street you got on a red dress you're sitting on the bed what that was clarity that was the mind of God and what happens to you and I when the mind of God comes to a group of people it gives them clarity of what your what's been many many listened many people are going to be saved many people are going to be born again but they're not gonna have the clarity that you and I have the clarity that you and I have is we can read that map and then the letters and are not blurred and the you know if you if you look at a map with no glasses on if you need glasses what does it look like looks like a spiderweb and you might get off on three different roads before you get on the right one but if you put on glasses you get clarity and you can see what roads you're going on that's what's the same way with you and I we are so blessed that we have clarity because as Jesus stepping into his Masonic office you and I have stepped into a messiah office we're little messiahs so what he gets we get romans 8 let me read it again we're heirs and joint heirs with Jesus Christ so whatever Christ got he would furnished with the necessary powers for its administration see wouldn't have been anything if Jesus would have just come like like brother Ram said he had to go to that grave and come out he proved who he was by coming out of that grave all during the three and a half years listen the religious world called him a devil the whole three and a half years they called him a demon but he was what furnish with the necessary powers you and I have been furnished with the necessary powers brother Dale's going to get into them because you know what that little button that little button without character now listen the buttons not satanic it's the way you use it all right but but power with character right it's fit to rule Jesus Christ had power and character you and I are going up that statue of a perfect man to get character not to get the Holy Ghost now it's to use what you already got because remember we're trying to get these pieces back together in doing Christians with the gifts of the Holy Spirit that's what Christ is that's what Christ came to do and then you say well then then that means that Christ wasn't revealed until the end time no it's not true remember they were looking at something Jesus said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved amen okay if that's all that's all that was there that was their little box that they had to work in remember I read that quote several Sundays ago God give every church age a box and you work in the box you're given when I listen what is our box our box is adoption and body change our box is not to be a good Christian you should do that already if you never listen these people never heard of the Prophet they'd had to wholly go hey man and live good cream clean Christian lives and went to church what a strange thing the bride does now we go when we want to take it back to the Bible folk alright let's read this right here Colossians 1 verse 26 is even the mystery which has been hidden from ages from generations now this is the Bible it's been hidden from ages and generations now this is Paul talking to the first church age maybe not even knowing because remember Paul was already dead right before John went to Padma so I don't know whether he knew of a Ephesians Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira Church ages I don't know that he did God may have revealed it to him but he never put it in the Bible John put it in the Bible when he went to the book when he went to revelations when he went to the Isle of Patmos but now watch what Paul's telling us even the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations but now it's made manifest to his Saints who is that that's us to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles now listen I don't don't get me wrong I am NOT a find out what Israel is doing person cuz that's not to me find out what Obama's doing or find out what Clinton's I don't care I say Clinton sorry I meant Trump I'm telling you y'all are looking at external your listen I know what you're doing we're human beings you're warning something to happen so you can say AHA told you it won't happen because God's not going to let you do that but what is the mystery which is Christ in you the hope of glory listen as this book of redemption or plan of redemption hinged on Jesus Christ it hinges on you to finish it you said what about Israel Israel can do zero zero until we leave zero not sure they can do things can plan up to it but they do zero they get no promise in this Gentile bride leaving the earth you may have individuals but I'm talking about the country of Israel Amen my brother Brown tells us to watch Russia he doesn't say anything about watching Israel he's just watching Russia okay I have my thoughts on that but that's okay but you know what they're just thoughts it has nothing to do with me whatever Russia does let me tell you something let me finish my thoughts from a few minutes ago you and I it's gonna happen to us first whatever little piece of of eternal that we click on then that's what something's gonna happen outside what we're doing is we got it totally reversed we think we can find something on the internet or some good book or some something that'll tell us we're bride right here this is the only place you're gonna find out whether your bride or not it's right here we already know what is what's gonna do we have another tooth who's gonna who's gonna preach to them we know that so why worry about it you better worry about getting Christ in you whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus what's Paul telling you you got a listen to preaching teaching every man and all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus alright let's go to the nation this is Matthew 24 and except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh should no flesh should be saved for the elects sake who is the elect where do you live for the elect that you but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened you said well we've been here a long time gotcha fixing to do a short work folks we either gonna be in or out we're gonna get left or we're goin one thing right then if any man shall say unto you now watch when you say if any man shall say unto you now somebody is going to talk to you some preacher is going to tell you lo here is Christ are there now see there you can go for you this well now Christ is going to Israel crisis crisis this crisis crisis in the seventh under virtue of message crisis in the two souls or the or the polygamy or in the what all that external stuff what the Bible say believe it not for there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very legs in other words even John when John was on Patmos when the Roman cattle are when the mother hor comes up in front of John the Bible says he admired it he admired it and the angel had to turn him away and say that thing's full of devils it almost caught John looking at it because it was so beautiful behold I have told you before wherefore if they they shall say unto you so it's not just one person they shall say unto you behold he's in the desert I was just out there there's nothing it's hot he's in the desert go not forth behold his in the secret chamber now that sounds good behold he's in the secret chamber believe it not far as the Lightning cometh out of the east and shines even to the west so shall also the coming of the Son of man be now listen no one knew where the son of man went they didn't know who he was when he was here and they don't know where he went and down through 7 Church ages most have not known where he went now sure we it is Christ in you the hope of glory always down through the 6th 7th 6th church ages and into this church age right they didn't get they didn't get a different Christ they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost they got the new birth for their box but their box had no requirement of adoption their box had no requirement of taking a bride and making a wife out of her they had no promise of a body change but our box does that don't make us no better but they without us are not gonna be made perfect amen so as the Lightning cometh out of the east and shyness even to the west I like that because it came from where he was that over there this is the western country right so shall also the coming in the Son of man be so now where is the son of man right here I am I'm part of that box Matthew 17 verse 5 we read this many times we're gonna read it again while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them now what is this brother branham uses this on what here you him this is the adoption part of your journey thereby okay with that this is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased here you him and when the disciples heard it they fell in their face and were sore afraid and Jesus came and touched him and said arise and being unafraid and when they lifted up their eyes they saw no man save Jesus only as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them says tell the vision to no man until the Son of Man be risen again from the dead and as the samples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias verse first come now see this disciples had read Malakoff for his disciples had read Malachi for cuz it's in the Old Testament Malachi 4 says the behold I'll send you Elijah the Prophet before the great and dreadful day of the Lord so they thought that alas and still now in Israel I preached only a long time ago they're looking for Elijah they know Elijah has to come on the scene before Christ and come to the Jews alright let's see they got some old news we got an updated part of the news because this Elijah they're looking for this one is our Elijah and it's the sample asked him saying why didn't say the scribes that Elias much first coming jesus answered instead on him he lies truly shall first come and restore all things now remember he goes on down and they think he's talking about John the Baptist but now remember John the Baptist did not restore all things so that's not the Elijah he's talking about so this Elijah must first come and restore all things under the Son of man ministry the Son of Man brother Branham stood one day and he said I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ why they put him back in a tomb they can't get him out for cross oh yeah sure Christ died 2,000 years ago to save me well where is he now he's in heaven they just don't realize he's right there in them if they're born again that's why I said you see the Bible says that nobody knows when the Son of Man win just like the Lightning going across the sky over but you and I do know where he is they maybe have looked for him for centuries and hundreds of years but we have found him amen that ought to make you happy it's like brother Darrell Ward said I will make a Baptist shout television - no man until the Son of Man be risen from the dead see there's nothing wrong with the television if you tell the right vision tell the vision television listen that's what listen that's what brother Branham saw man got sure man caught on to what God's already been doing brother Branham said God what man has broke into God's laboratory what to create a television but now remember a television brother I'm explains in a television only does not produce a picture it only shows the picture that's already been developed how that God saw you before the foundation of the world innovation that's got to come to pass there was just one little commercial in there called sin amen as well a little commercial one little interruption called sin and you know what God can't stand sin so he had to what but he didn't do away with the vision it was already recorded you know we have these things now that that that you can record things you know what it had to be produced somewhere it only captures what's already been done when brother Branham saw that he would look at those people if he saw that that tape or that one that they did what is it the not 20th century prophet but the one when he was in Chicago you could see me you watch him he turns his head what he's he's watching the television yeah brother Graham told us to get rid of our but you know what he told us to get rid of the wrong one if you would have been in the right vision you'd have been okay but that's what he done he was looking at that person and he just looks off to the corner what there's a portal opens up right here he said how do you know that well what's he looking at he said I see you he's lying if he wasn't sin nice sees this person here but there's a television screen pops up right here in high-definition and says I see you as a young woman and you have a car wrecked you're throwing up in the air memory tells it when we said you're throwing up in here he's watching it he's watching it on a television and it's something that's already happened because it can't fabricate if it fabricates something is wrong and it could be wrong but it's not fabricated but lay it's already been put in what the mind of God you're already put in the mind of God you're a part of the mind of God tell the vision to no one until he tells him don't tell nobody why you know what Jesus is telling them you're not gonna understand this until the Son of Man comes back again and when did he come back in our day the son of man message just like it was when that man standing there the same message is here today in its clarity not in a father son Holy Ghost baptism not in the Trinitarian doctrine no clarity because when Jesus was standing here on earth there wasn't a Trinity he was it and the early disciples knew he was it remember it would talk to the 3rd church age before Nasia said no it's three of them because brother branham was here to restore the faith of the father's hail ice truly shall first come and restore all things now what do you do he restored us back to the faith of the fathers all right there buddy okay with that so what did he do let's read this right here number four trying to do God a service without being his will now God has a provided an original way to do things and he'll never do it contrary to that the box right now he promised in the last days what he would do and it sent them us the message and this message would have the same identification as Elijah had as he lost your head as John the Baptist's head and it would turn the hearts of the people not to the denomination but back to the original Apostolic Faith back to the word how these things have been uh vindicated so remember when we look over here in the first church aid we know one thing's for sure that was the faith of the father's that was the original message that was there wasn't a denomination there wasn't a to soul that wasn't then got the doctrine all messed up yet they were starting because remember Grievous wolves comes in and even in the first church age that white horse rider rode in that first church days but he wasn't predominant it was just a little saying then it made its way on up but Elijah was to turn us back to that and call out a bride for his age right for this age right here I'm gonna put our age but now remember brother branham just wasn't sent to us to take out a bride for him you understand what I'm saying daddy Seymour had a message that brought out a bride amen the one-eyed black man all they had a message that brought out a bride if yet they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost their bride that's why you gonna understand me one day when I tell you I'm not degrading brother branham but there's gonna be billions I say millions of brides that never heard of William Branham bride rod but not a fully mature bride that's never heard of William am Branham he came to do two things how many times has this been preached he came to what turn us back to the original faith of the fathers get rid of all the denominations not to the denomination but back to the original Apostolic fathers back to the word how these things have been if indicated now this is in 1965 all right howling in the sounding of the last angel revelations 10 days the seven things of these mysteries that's all been why did the method let's do this and the Baptist and the Church of Christ in Jehovah Witness now watch now he's going to take it up a notch told you come to do two things he come to turn the hearts of the father's back I mean two children back to the father's back to the original Oh didn't know no eternal hell water baptism everything was what turned back but now remember that doesn't change your body it didn't change theirs it did not it did not change their body them mysteries will be revealed in the last day when the seventh angel seventh angels message when he not when he starts out doing this now I want to clear something up real quick I know most of you believe it and then so do I there's a lot of people in this message believes that from 1947 to 1963 you're not supposed to listen to that because he made so many mistakes and he was all this and all that heard it before right Aaron heard it before but now from 63 to 65 he was true and and you know like brother Dale said the son of man came and straighten brother Branham out no it was a progression of his message it was a progression of his ministry all right because he did two things turn the hearts of the children babies babbling baby Pentecostal babies to the faith of the fathers and then and then come to do something else and then see when he begin not when he starts out doing this now when he started doing this he was bringing out what Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal and listen to be real honest with you they might have all not went to a message church because there wasn't any at that time they probably went back to their Methodists and their Pentecost in there but that first part of his message was to bring them out and get them born again and then bring a bride out during that Pentecostal age coming through hello hey we got grief I'm telling you that's why a lot of us you can say what you want to I like preaching somewhere else because they will be attentive and listen and amen and sometimes she'll you know why because it's not old news I mean it's old news to some of you it's not old news to them right don't even sit there like a bump on a pickle who said that Aaron did Wednesday night you sit there like a bump on a pickle take a pickle out and look at it sometime let's get the box it's horrible I feel like I told him out in Arizona I see you y'all watch y'all watch the 10 commandments for three hours and never get up and go to the bathroom three hours I watched the Ten Commandments other night boy it was so good where's Rebecca brother Gary Atkins bless his heart I miss the guy we all miss him but we're gonna see he'd sit there and he had watched that thing so many times he said I'll go very one day and he was watching it and he was saying it before they said it he was saying the lines of the whole movie have any of you ever decided to do the scripture that way but we can sit there for three hours and watch a movie and never go to sleep you know why cause it excites you if this don't excite you we got some growing up to do folks we think we got it all we think we don't have to hear we think we're just well it's just brother Wade and brother Dale they say the same thing over and over again you gonna get left here you gonna get left here when he starts that doing this but when he begins to sound this not when he starts out doing this but when he begins to sound his message see not the years in preparation from 47 to 63 he was preparing he was turning the heart of the babbling Pentecostal babies Methodist Baptist whatever you want to say turn them to what back to the original word but that didn't do him any good as far as changing their body or even getting them to adoption that got them born again which is fine that's okay I told them out there I'm tell you this church the ministry in this church I am saying it because I know the ministry in this church the ministry in this church is not getting a bride ready boy you wake up on that one God's coming after a wife watch this I'll prove it to you right Anderson let's go ahead brother let's go ahead and insert that quote the one I inserted let's go do it the one right before first Thessalonians what's this on the first seal now listen this is his new ministry this is 1963 now watch he said he would be known in the last day but it comes forth in a church symbol do you understand it Church church come forth in a symbol of a church that they know there is a seal but just what it is yet they don't know oh this is a horse rider and it only is to be revealed at the last day when this actual seal is broken broken - who not to Christ but to the church notice now oh my that just makes me tremble something happened he been saying Church church Church church Church that just makes me tremble I hope that the church truly understands it see what I mean you people watch him now I'm going to call you bride there is not another quote that says that in this whole message that's the only quote I put in call you bride and that's the only quote that comes up I'm going to call you bride see that you'll understand it so the bride is the only one to understand the first part of his message and him identifying that it's only to the bride now it's not to the church its to the bride because watch now watch him continue on let's read this one the voice is a thunder the voice came from where from the throne where the lamb had just left as intercessor intercessor for who and where is the throne now he's standing here to take his position and his claim now who's he claiming he's claiming us but where does he come from but the Thunder came from the inside and the lamb was standing out here oh my talked about a revival I just read that a few minutes ago I had to put this in and the lamb was standing out here and the thunder where the lamb had left the Father's throne to take his own throne now what is our promise in the seventh church age that we would sit in his role as he said on the Father's throne it was the Father's throne down through 7 Church ages now this is the throne that he's always wanted to sit on he called you bride but I'm gonna tell you something from that point on it was my responsibility and your responsibility to maturity into a wife because in revelations 19 it says his wife has made herself ready his wife has made herself ready you take the analogy of brother I mused about the armored meat packing man ok they ain't got married yet so you can't use it all the way but I'm going to use this far enough remember he goes away he said one year one year from this day I'll be back now listen that woman that he thought so much of and he was going to wait one year to marry her he was going to wait 2,000 years to come back and get her now I promise you one thing she didn't go sit on the porch and wait for a year she got ready and listened she had to do it by herself cuz all the mother sister said he's not coming back after you he's coming back to get us she said whatever he told me he told me that he said he's coming back for me and I'm gonna get myself ready I'm not going to be and she wasn't in the barn with slop up to her knees when he got bashed no she was standing on the porch and here he come because she had made herself ready amen now let's show this in Jesus's ministry back up brother Anderson I'm sorry back up to were back up to number let's go back to number four like I said we're gonna be another 20 minutes so just deal with it we'll go outside and talk about everything else for another hour so because remember with this God has a provided an original way to do things and he'll never do it contrary to that see that's why we can depend on the Word of God we can depend on brother Browns message because he gave us the road map and it's not going to change it's not gonna change it's going to happen exactly the way that he said it was going to happen they promised in the last days that he would and it sent them us the message and this message would have the same identification as a larger light return the Baptist and it would turn the hearts of the people not to the denomination but back to the original fathers back to the word how these things have been what vindicated how did in the sounding of the last angel in the days of the seventh angel these mysteries that's all been why did the Methodists do this to Baptist do this church across Java witness all do this their mysteries will be revealed in the last day when the seventh angel seventh angels message not when he starts out doing this remember there's one quote and I don't know if I have it or not we're brother Brown says not in the healing campaign listen the healing campaign what got their attention you don't catch fish with just baked it's got to be a bait in the hook so the healing ministry will be the bait but the hook is the bride getting ready because you got to have that hook to what a man brother Branham was catching trout he was catching them not when he starts out doing this but when he begins to sound his message so see he sounded a message that's brought it to a bride and he says in 1963 now I call you bride well now everything after that it's already bride it's already bride if you're born again you already bride but to fulfill revelations 19 to get to come back after a wife there's gotta something happen not the years in preparation but when he begins to sound the message these mysteries then shall be revealed and here they are not knowing them and you people are a witness of that number five works his faith expression 1965 but remember Abraham wasn't in Sodom he was already called out and there was one state and talked to him and the one state and talked to him showed him a sign with his back turned he said Sarah was going to have that baby that he had waited on a man with his back turned and he called it God Elohim now that's where people put brother Branham so close to God cuz remember I think sister clay there was they were at the marriage into what she was sitting there when he preached marriage and divorce right there was one part of that of that time of preaching that in the Parkview whatever it was High School where he turned his back remember he turned his back and he's looking out this window out this way well that was God showing us that God was here dr. brother Branham was God but that God was here using him to show us where we're living and that was in 1965 February right before he went off the scene about ten months later now that brings us to pass today because we have faith and I know this is of God it's because this in other scriptures point to this our revelations Tencent in the hour of the seventh angels message when he begins to send forth his message not in a healing service I'm telling you what he said not in a healing service but the message that follows the healing service go see this what happened I know I know none of you remember the first message I preached in this church in November of 1998 or 99 I preached a message first message they ever preached and I brought the parallel with brother Branham and Jesus Christ most of you thought I was talking about brother Branham cuz they're their ministry is so close and it's got to be close it's the Ministry of Jesus Christ but look what happened Jesus went forth and preached he healed the sick and everything old that young rabbi that prophet he's a great fellow brother branham he's a great guy you got to get him in here bring you know ten thousand people and we're gonna see a miracle we want him in our church but one day he stood and said I and my father are one they didn't want him no more when brother Brian preached the seals he said thousands of my friends when he preached marriage and divorce he said thousands of my friends will go away from me he stood alone at the end of his message why because nobody understood him and it wasn't for them that part of that message was not for those people in that age that was not their box their box was coming he's here except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood he didn't explain it said except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man drinks his blood you have no life why I imagine them doctors and nurses sitting this fellow's a vampire trying to get us to drink his blood see they didn't understand it he knowed it so dear brother branham but them disciples look at me but them disciples oh it's not a one-man show anymore huh and it to me it's no show but it's not a one-man doctrine anymore a one-man message it was at one time but them disciples they might not have been able to explain it but they sat down and believed it anyhow a man for it was revealed to them yes sir they know that the Scriptures had declared it listen you didn't have to tell the Apostle Paul not to eat Jesus's flesh and drink his wood he knew the revelation behind that Peter knew the revelation behind that you and I know the revelation behind it that's why as this thing gets closer to the end we're not gonna be popular people even in the message you're not gonna be popular people cuz you're gonna speak a language that a lot of people don't know excuse me they know that the Scriptures had declared it first Thessalonians 4 for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we remember I told you a couple weeks ago God showed me a scripture of this scripture right here is to no one but you and I know one for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them with your sleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the voice of the Archangel and Trump of God let's stop right there Paul was prophesying he never saw this he's telling the vision he saw a vision he didn't know who it was but he saw a vision he didn't know it was Donnie faught Bush and you know you know I said the other day about brother Bram seeing this third part of the of the Seventh Seal opened up in an unknown language why he didn't know what it was he didn't know who was sitting here didn't know anybody a certain group of people but somebody did for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout what was the shout we've heard it what was the voice we've heard it and we're waiting on the voice of the Archangel which is white like brother down said this morning what is the work of the voice of the Archangel brother Graham said that was the resurrection the resurrection angel and where brother brother Dale said this morning brother Brahm said where's the resurrection that oh it's out yonder somewhere it's in a book but I just say it's in you so you are a total recipient of this scripture right here you're gonna hear and be participating in all three the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God where's the trumpet going to sound to do to to to to we're gonna have to call the Philadelphia Philharmonic Orchestra to come out here the Mormon Tabernacle Choir that beats kind of strange moment rattling you know what there we go with external you said oh that must be somebody's gonna shout somebody's gonna have a voice and we're gonna hear a Trump where is it going to come from you it's gonna come from you and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we I circled that in my Bible we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord you know comfort each other with these words but you know Paul just kind of mmm not to be sacrilegious but that's a little vague it's this so shall with ever be with the Lord but we had a prophet with some high definition visions to tell us exactly how that's going to happen we're going to go to a wedding supper for three and a half years and then we're going to walk come back into millennium and we're going to live a thousand years in the Millennium and then we're gonna be taken off the earth and God's gonna watch this whole thing off and there's gonna be a future home come down that's made for me and you brother Brown took all them scriptures and put them together where Paul didn't Paul just said it so shall we ever be with the Lord he really didn't explain the specifics you know why wasn't time for it but now it's time for it it's time that you and I know every move that God makes you should know it wherefore comfort one another with these words for 2,000 years they've been doing that comforting each other but we've come to a place now where we're not going to comfort each other with those words we're gonna live them we're gonna be that word made manifest look at number 6 real quick I may not get finished but you know what that's okay and Sabina Kenyon he said this is the third pole now there's three great things that goes with it one folder today or yesterday the other one in folder today and there's one I cannot interpret because it's in an unknown language but I was standing right there and looking right straight at it this is the third poll coming up what is the third poll the third poll is the opening of the word it's not a tent vision it's not all these other things people want to say it is it's the revealing of the word revealing Christ Christ in you and where he's at he's in you all right that's all reason the reason all heaven was solid you know why why why is there something going on so great in there silence so total secret it's a secret listen le azar took Rebecca by the hand and told her about Isaac told her every move everything he liked everything he didn't like he told her how he looked how he walked what if mannerism was he told her all that so that when Rebecca was in a field riding on camel and I'm sure they wasn't just one man standing out in that field it was probably a bunch of servants and people standing out there in the field but Eliezer had told Rebecca a vision and made that vision so real that she looked and she said there he is but now remember remember le azar his work was done it three's a crowd when you go to a honeymoon okay I hope you realize that one day three's a crowd when you go to honeymoon why eliazar stepped off the scene because he had taught he done his job brother Brown done his job he entered it he said I now call you bride and now bride I want you to take this message and it's going to be a secret it's not gonna be some great denomination we're not gonna have this great big move of God anymore it's gonna be a secret cause Ellie's are probably told other people about Isaac and it really didn't click but remember he said whatever woman walks up to this well and feeds asked me to feed my camel what one woman he went looking for one woman and he found her because he had asked God he said god I gotta get somebody for Isaac and I gotta get her ready and I gotta introduce her to Isaac but I know once I introduced her to Isaac I got to step off the scene my job is finished but what happened was truth be known whatever le azar told Rebecca became a part of Rebecca became a part of Rebecca because what Rebecca did is when she looked and saw him what eleazar's voice was in the back of her head he's got this kind of walk he's got this kind of talk he's got this kind of mannerism he she had to be told by somebody what Christ looked like and what mannerisms he would have same way with Mordecai Mordecai and you know I love to presume I had done it a long time but whom Esther now what Mordecai and Esther the king in the chamber but Mordecai what nurtured her here do this do that do this present this do this do that then they had all the Chamberlain's around Chamber Chamberlain's around her telling her he likes this he likes that mmm preachers listen we got a vision I told the church last Sunday I said my vision is it's to present a wife to Christ not a bride cuz I know I know and I'm listen I just want to tell you this I'm not a salvation preacher you should know that I don't try to get people to come to the altar but I know my position I want to take somebody that's already a bride somebody's got to do it that's already a bride and teach her how to be a wife but now there are other people in the fivefold ministry brother Bob brother Aaron Louise brother down he fulfills them all then we'll preach you that but I just it's not my make up you know that cuz I don't have a pole to bring people to the altar I want you to get in your seat I want you to comes to remember our mature wife will I mat or wife will know exactly what God wants at any point in time but it's going to be a secret why is it going to be a secret because remember this thing is honing down not to organizations not to numbers not to thousands God had a great church one time the founding Church of Christianity was twelve people and that's as many people as we have on our stage if they're all there playing music twelve people but you know what they all had to wholly go they all had power under that first Church age everybody okay but this all was a three-fold mystery but let's go to number nine brother and we'll stop right here we know what the threefold part everything is in addition your new burst and a three-fold justification about to he'll go so everything God does in threefold remember the sixth seal open in a three-fold manner remember that all right the seventh seal opened in a three-fold manner and then he comes to cross the mystery God revealed and he said now if you're missing the seals come back to this message this message is not Jesus Christ as a mystery of God reveal it's Christ it's the mystery of God revealed going right back to revealing Christ alright cuz remember you're not Jesus but you are Christ you can't be Jesus Christ you'd be misses Jesus Christ but you can't be Jesus Christ he's one person but you can be Christ because it's revealing Christ and where is he he's in you all right now look now God has had a three-fold purpose in this great mystery secret now what was a great mystery secret all God was he poured in the cross cost in the church we're gonna read it mmm God in this great mystery secret that he had before the world fixing the telus division fixin to tell us division some of you're watching the vision at the bank II eyelids God in this great mystery secret that he had before the world began planning purpose gonna see it come to pass God in His great mystery secret that he had before the world began he's got a three-fold purpose in it so the whole purpose is these three things he's fixing to tell us right here and now what we want to go upon this morning is what is that three-fold purpose now I believe by the help of God now look how confident brother Branham is who is present can you say that today who is present and he'll show it to us now did God come down and say okay I'm the second person of eternity here I am I'm gonna tell he revealed it right through that little man called William Branham ma'am mm-hmm now if he had this three full purpose we want to find out what is this threefold purpose first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it is too great Jehovah who covered all space-time and eternity he could not he's too great to ever be revealed to people now if he'd have stopped right there we would all been in bad shape but he kept going because it would be too mysterious how could that great beam that never did begin we're gonna put it back together in a minute though never did begin that after you went beyond the cycle 100 billions trillions of years alive space infinity that's eternal the great creature that was all that and still is but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood he was the father and the only way he could express it was become a son of man and what is the son of man Word made flesh all right that is the reason Jesus kept saying the son of man see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now you get it congregation says amen he wanted to express itself that was his one of his great threefold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal his self in Christ second to have the preeminence in his body of believers that is his bride that he might live in people not with people in people all right keep going when I think of it I just see denominations pass off the scene and everything else go and see when I see God's great purpose revealing himself and having first to reveal himself in Christ not in a Trinity not in it in Christ the trueness the fullness of the Godhead bodily and then to bring that fullness of the Godhead bodily bodily partly into a people that's not what he said and then to bring that fullness of Godhead bodily into a peace so that he can have the preeminence is the oversight of the leading a people not one person a people we're a mini membered body we can't get away from that all right let's go to the next one first to express itself completely God in Christ second to have the preeminence by this in his church which is his body the bride till he can have the premises to express himself through them through them not through him through them and thirdly to restore the kingdom look at me to restore the kingdom to its rightful position everything right back together oh yeah there was a little bit of time gap where there was some sin come in but you know what it didn't change these two pieces of paper this is a piece of paper and so is this it never changed we just lost the way remember I told you brother branham tells us that Jesus didn't come to bring us an inheritance he didn't I've read that quote a hundred times he came to what bring us back to our inheritance yeah we lost it how about lost it then but to bring us back to our inheritance because remember our inheritance was what this piece of paper he just got tore apart jesus said I am the way the truth and the life and I'm going to bring it back together but what happened was right in here somewhere man started dealing in it and it started doing this and there's no way false doctrines does this so we had to have a prophet come to give us clarity so that it'll fit right back and you know what I tore that and you'll never be able to put back right but you know what God can God's gonna put that thing right back together thirdly to restore the kingdom to it's rightly positioned that fell by sin by the first item back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talked with them fellowshipped with them brother branham calls you bride back in 1963 at the opening of the seals that narrows it down taking it from the church down to a bride because remember he'd used Church and bride all down through there but now he even says here he corrects his self by this in his church this is 1963 right after the seals which is his body the bride not just the church listen if you're not born again you're not in the body you're not part of the body if you're not born again okay so the bride is part of his body and listen you and I will be made known like I said before about this right here not by out not by external it'll become everything internal it's got to come in here first sure you got to hear it external you got to hear it but if it stays up here it's just intellect but if it'll drop down to right here in that center part and let that button continue to grow I don't think I have anymore that old that all the quote I think it is maybe mm-hmm is that there one more I've lost my page if not that's it they shut me down so anyway but all God was he poured into Christ now where's Christ qasas in you God has told us now where he's at but now John just to finish that but what's inside of you is gonna take you back to before the fall I came from God and I'm going back to God I came from the eternal mind of God mm-hmm and I honestly tell you this with all sincerity God didn't just think of me he thought Adolph Hitler he thought of Judas Iscariot he thought of sinners but the literal part of me that's working today inside of me is his mind you said I was too strong no I don't think you're strong enough because remember one time that vision had to either become a reality or it was already a reality god don't just do you understand what I'm saying God don't just make up think no he had a vision a planning the purpose and he saw you in it if he knew you would sit here and listen and become bribed he knew that so what is that that's not a second person remember this is a piece of paper and this is the piece of paper it's not paper and plastic if you're born again today you always were eternal you always were eternally there's not a day that you weren't when that part of you is the eternal part of God and then let's stand our feet what's next brother wait what's next I just told you what's next take us back to the Garden of Eden have a body change in a resurrection got to get the Saints out of the ground first we got to hear that voice musicians come got to hear that voice but that voice is gonna come from inside of you the Bible tells us there's no weapon formed against us that will prevail you know what that is there's no weapon there's no weapon form there's no external force that will ever take you down but there is an internal force that will take you down if you don't get born again if you don't sit under the Word of God and listen there be an internal force will take you down but thank God that we've had a prophet bring us a message and that you and I are able to read it in our own language don't need an interpretation we got all 1,100 sermons when you understand every one of them not like some people over in overseas in different places they have a hard time interpreting and then some of them don't have but a couple of hundred bucks listen we got the whole thing well now they're doing better but used to but I'll tell you then people in those foreign countries they're sincere and you get one that's a good one he knows cuz you know what God's not gonna say well I'm gonna reveal it all to the Americans no you know what we are under condemnation worse than they are because God sent us a prophet to our homeland in our own voice in our own dialect southern so we can understand him and then we still reject it or turn it down or make it into something else that's why America is gonna get it before anybody else does just because we rejected not we US but America has rejected but you know what America is rejecting you America is rejecting you we are rejected and despised group of people and it's gonna get worse cuz remember I told you our downfall listen I'm gonna tell you this and no English say no more our downfall that's not what they're doing in jeffersonville our downfall is what we put up with our downfall is what we let in our downfall that's what we do and don't do don't come to church don't read our Bible don't study don't do the things of God it's our problem not their problem and then so whatever you want to take that any way you want to that's not gonna harm me or help me but I know one thing's for sure if you stay in Christ he'll keep you in this word and it'll never fail it'll do exactly what it said it would do and no external force no external happening it's going to make you bright or not bright it's what happens inside you become bright from the inside and let it work its way out I mean let's sing let's sing a song god bless you Steve is in the 360 is He that is in me greater is He that is in me and he that is in the world turns like a [Music] bunny and I'll promise you when you get up in the morning on Monday he'll be right there but you know what no external force he can't harm you brother Brad said it if st. bothers you it means you went out of the reasons stay behind Oh greater is He that is in me greater is He that is in me love it greater is He that is in me than he that is it's how it all got started right here on the day of Pentecost a rushing mighty wind it came into the hour and baptized all of them listen now with a Power greater than it external it up so I've got it too and I'm gonna let the whole world Oh sing it to it all greater is He that is in me greater is He that is in me greater is He that is in me [Music] well that's that's it for me as far as the seals so that's that's some of the whole thing up all God was he poured into Christ all Christ reported any me and you and he's taking us back to the Garden of Eden he's taking us back past where there was sin but here's the bad part but somebody's got to come to a place of perfection be Christians if you want to and you can shout like you did this morning my brother Dells to being a baby listen I don't mind being a baby I won't stay a baby though it be malnourished for Sterling to well anyway to go to his mom and daddy's house and say mama I need to do you change my diaper at 20 for 2223 there'd be something wrong with that picture but now starlings grown up I've seen him come from diapers to now most of us have always faces red now but but that's the way God is though doctor want us to stay babies he's telling us to grow up you're already you know sterling with a helm when he was born when he came out crying he was a he'll he was born in the family came tonight no way genetically he came out tonight why can't it be the same way that when we're birthdays Christians the world can't deny the world came deny who our Father is the world can't deny where we come from oh yeah well we got all these things here well we got all these things but you know what don't stay babies don't be happy being a baby please don't you know what because that makes you lazy to just say oh well oh I'm born again brother Darrell said I was born again everything's fine I like being a baby I don't you don't either how many of you oh please I don't want to be a baby even brother Brown said if I could turn back time I wouldn't go back to being there that puts you in another time another period we're in this age right here to be a mature Christian somebody that's growing up in a the right kind of food I [Music] don't want to be a baby I like to be in a baby but you know what I don't have a lot of memory of being a baby naturally and you know what even spiritually if you've been in this thing a long time yeah there's some things that you but I need an updated revelation I need God to speak to me adult-to-adult now he will speak adult to baby but only just for a little while because I'm telling you you can grieve God grieve not the Holy Spirit I read it we're by your sealed until the day of your Redemption brother branham in the in the adoption series he said the Holy Ghost comes back to the Father and says all this one is just like you but now remember he also said the Holy Ghost goes back to the father and says this one ain't doing so well right you decide that he don't you decide that you decide how far you want to go do you want to stay a baby that's okay we'll say ashes to ashes dust to dust over your grave but I don't want to do that I want us to walk off this world off this earth and not have to look into death I don't want to do that and I don't I don't want you to do that I want you to strive to be a wife of Jesus Christ not a bride be a wife grow up no brother Branham says and I'll read it next time we come together I think I've already got it she has his potentials she is him she has his potential what is his potential hey listen Jesus Christ was a natural baby and he had to come to natural things but he was always God he was always God if you realize that then you'd this little thing called life and time and all these things that we go through pretty much nothing because remember all God sees is your piece of paper and his piece of paper and he's bringing it right back together to where that thing will come back to an eternity and remember this again this is two pieces of paper this is one piece of paper that was tore apart by us and gods putting that one piece of paper back together it's not paper and plastic so that way you can see where you came from let me do this real close where you came from what you're doing here go that's the part where my head is what you're doing here and where you going to this doesn't change eternal doesn't change position changes you're in this position here we know where we came from we know what we're doing here and we know what we're going back to thank God for that god bless you let's sing that on the day of Pentecost one more time or you oh you won't sing something else you saying whatever you want to know I'm not the song leader you saying it changed my life you thought I was worth keeping so you clean we pray to God to give you a good way lit he'll protect you ready to hear from the Word of God pray for bread the Royal and the ones that are not here pray for them pray for the ones that are not here pray for other boy for that kidney stone did he don't have anymore amen pray for each other because you know what we need each other don't put yourself on an island we depend on each other because you know what we're heard animals lambs only die down brother how lambs or sheep only die when they separate their self from the herd because that's what the line looks for he looks for one seperated he looks for one over here what he don't want to find them all he wants to find one don't separate everything brother Brown said find yourself closer together as the day approaches come to church read your Bible study pray for each person is here you don't have to call him by name listen we're a body so pray for the body pray for each one we've all gotten things that we need prayer for we all got things that we need we have needs but God knows them he knows how to deal with them a man loved the Lord let's pray the Heavenly Father we pray Lord that you would be with us as we continue our journey thank you for allowing us to come into this building and be covered by your word Lord we pray that everyone in this building would receive a little shot of rejuvenation that we'll all live a little closer to you Father that will count the things that as though they are not like Abraham not worrying about the external things Abraham could a lot of could have used a lot of things to not come to that promise but he said your God and you will make that promise come to pass so god I know your God and I know you're gonna make up the promises come to pass for our children that are not saved for our fathers mothers husbands brothers sisters wives every one of us need prayer father we pray that you will just be with us now take care of us lead us and guide us bind together closer to you Father we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ and as the wheels turn going home may we be singing only believe all things are possible thank you Father for giving us the new birth for giving us a chance to learn more about you there's a lot of people in this world or never get a chance to even know you lord much less know more about you but Lord you gave us the open book we live and preach and breathe by the open book that everything has been given to this little bride to make her a wife and I pray that you would just do that father raise us up as brother Dale starts preaching on the statue of a perfect man maybe this lord I pray maybe this the last round that we that we have to take before we go to that body change before the resurrection that this last push there'll be one great push one great anointing before this thing takes over and the world turns into chaos but Lord you told us to a little profit that you're gonna come and get us before that happens and it will not be part of that father we pray that you would just be with us now and take care of us the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you're dismissed god [Music]
