remember Brother Willie Ross one time I was preaching and he's a black brother and we was down in me you know and and uh brother yansy and he was singing and his kids was slate and about that time he looks over and one of his boys come in he said Here Comes one of my late children here come another one of my late children he said better get in for the door closed Amen brother Tom God bless God bless you too I had my wife call uh because I was to chicken to Sister Margie and seller that we'd be late and that it was raining cats and dogs and excuses and but we are here I do understand in Chattanooga about an hour delay because of a traffic jam a semi ran right over one of the big concrete embankments right through it and had the whole thing I do understand an hour but we weren't going to be very late and then we pulled into ohe and there was another traffic jam and I knew then brother Homer was up to something and we waited and then there big long line for a while there too but again there was another bad accident so I hope nothing real bad but I'm grateful to the Lord to be here and I want to be here I come cuz I want to be here amen amen and today I celebrate the 24th birthday of my first son who passed away into Glory all right and at the same same time today I celebrate this is the last pill my daughter will be taking is today started with she come out of the hospital taking 21 pills and we just slowly weaned it off as the Lord would permit and as the doctors would counsel most of the time but recently one of the doctors said well this one and this one it's off the table you can't get off of that one and then uh but uh this this is the last day so we're very very grateful I remember walking in the door and I wanted to see one person I wanted to see Hunter Loria and I couldn't find him and I looked down the road I saw all these big handsome guys and where's Hunter because I remember getting a call not that long ago I wanted you don't know how blessed we are I got this call and and he had gotten in this accident and my heart just went right down in the ground and started dragging around like it felt like my own son had gotten in an accident and then I heard the great report and so I I'm real glad amen so God is God's on the move and he's uh he's very carefully shaping and molding us into an image using all these events in our lives Hunter will never be the same my daughter will never be I certainly will never be the same and uh all of us here are going through one thing after another if you're called to be bride amen and I've come to the conclusion there's a lot of Christians and not all are called to be bride there's a lot of lovely sisters here today I just look at all my friends but only one of them was my bride right amen and and that's how it is out in this world and how we ought to love them how blessed are you if you understand the revelation of this last hour all right it is simply God's grace revealing unto you yes his will for your life and you actually let him mold you and shape you into an image that he's pleased with and that is perfectly in line with his his word amen and uh we we went up to Wisconsin I had a brother who died a few weeks ago and uh we went and visit our Pentecostal Church where we come from and you know we just started listening to that old preaching and they said if you hadn't uh spoken in anyone who didn't speak with tongues has no power with God thought okay and they says if you don't go to church that believes in that you have no power with God then they said before Pentecost nobody had any power with God I'm thinking well how in the world could all that [Laughter] be and that was the closest thing to the truth that I knew of outside of this message what this message is it's a revelation of the Life of Christ inside of a human being amen and it's for us and it's uh you know people say well we're preaching Jesus we're and I think they ought to keep doing it because without salvation you're not even in the ring but the bride she's going up in her Rapture right it's not another message or another gospel but the question of Salvation has been settled for the bride she knows she's saved because we heard the voice of John the Revelator scream out in heaven CU he saw the lamb take the book and we know we're Sav but there's another event that must happen right people say well we don't need the message you do need the message well we got Jesus and we're saved that's true you're saved but do you want to be in the Rapture you want to be left behind I don't want to have to die for my faith because I I didn't catch the Ark in the days of Noah or I would have been putting that blood over the doorpost in the days of Moses why CU I'm predestinated to that revelation of my hour and in this hour there's another Ark being built and it's a word Arc and when God sees that word inside of a human being he takes it off this earth when he comes back down and those that are dead will be quickened first and then us that's the difference well you mean we need more than G it is Jesus it's Jesus in spoken word form speaking to a people calling them actually identifying you it's become the Inconvenient Truth because many a heart and many a soul hears and says you know it is kind of true I believe I'll go ask my pastor if I have to do it and they'll say no you don't it's not up to your pastor or my pastor it's up to God Almighty you hear it you'll be accountable for it he'll say but what did you do when Noah opened the door of the Ark and asked you to come in this word if this word ever gets inside of you like it got inside of Paul the Apostle in his day and William brandom in his day and us in our day if that word is in you you cannot be lost you cannot the Rapture cannot even happen without you being in it I was a hold up on this thing for 29 years but not anymore and I want to say the trials that I've been through have shaped me and molded me and I'm understanding them now when there was less of Tom crocheting it seemed like Jesus was much more welcome in my life there's an enemy out there and the enemy is is the ease of the flesh whatever you want it's there the click of a little thing gets you whatever you want beware of that when everything looks so easy beware that you might be missing something crucial amen what is that crucial thing in this hour it's the word of God revealed amen that Bible's been around for hundreds of years people actually read the Bible and killed 68 million Christians they read the Bible another day and allowed the Jews to be persecuted you know a giant ship come with Jewish immigrants in our country said no you can't have them and they sent them back to Israel or excuse me to Europe and they all got killed in a a death chamber they all had the Bibles to read but then God comes down and he Reveals His intent for the hour it Chang us amen that's why it's not Theory it's conviction people say well how do you memorize all this stuff I'm not memorizing anything this what I feel it's what I actually feel well society's changed it has changed it's going to change so much one day we're going to walk right out of here so blessed are you if you're even saved bless you because if you're saved you will make it through the tribulation you will suffer though but blessed 10 times over are you if you've heard the word of this hour and have heard it and I've seen it I've I've been blessed brother Brown said he said if this be the truth of Almighty God's word he said then

anyhow right you better hurry up I'm forgetting all the things I was all right uh you want me to use that all right well not your bu something better brother anyway amen you love the Lord amen amen well I just want to say what a privilege it is to be here again at uh with brother Homer and at the fellowship meeting we've always appreciated uh coming and being a part of it and we we we're even farther south than you are so you think you're Southern we're even more Southern I guess I don't know how that works but I just want to take the time to appreciate each one of you each one of the ministers that we've heard speak and I I I come from a different generation than most of you the ones that have spoke is that okay to say that you don't feel bad well you was talking about how old you was anyway most of them so but uh I I want to I want to appreciate you and and thank you for the life that you've lived and uh it's not how great we are how great we can speak what great things we've done it's he that endureth to the end the Bible says they shall be saved and you know there's some that run for a while and and and they have some great Ministries or whatever uh all over the map you know and but I appreciate men like you that that just lived an example for for men like me that I can come up with these examples of in front of me to realize sometimes a young Minister can think that it's all about him but the longer you live you realize it's all about him it's not about you can you say Amen it's about him and and about how we surrender oursel and get oursel out of the way just hearing brother Bram say that the gift uh is not so much exercising it it's how you get yourself out of of the way you have to get yourself out of the way in order for God to move and and that's that that can take a lifetime of realizing that but I just want to say God bless you and bring greetings from our assembly back home in Sarasota Florida I want to appreciate me brother JT God bless you again it's good to see you brother Dale God bless you and these these brothers I I remember all of them when I was young and uh I'm not I can't really say that much anymore huh when you here forget anyway in just a moment so I you know I but I do remember you know and then to meet others along the way like brother Tom and and um and trying to see some of the other younger ministers in here I was going to say Brother David but he's not that young and but it just it's just been a blessing and I just appreciate each one of you may God bless you amen we I do understand also that uh that food uh eating starts a half hour after ice started so I don't have much time left to say much so we just want to go right to the word you ministers know how it is that when you when you uh uh study and try to find the mind of the Lord on what to say and then he can change it amen just real quick God is good at keeping us uncomfortable and nervous you know that's part of the humility process but I I I I appreciate the way he works with us and deals with us so if this seems a little strange to you uh today you just uh just put it up to the Lord amen this is what he laid on our heart this morning you know I'm I'm kind of the the type that likes to have it lined out a week or two in advance but then sometimes it just don't work that way but God bless you certain and appreciate you brother Homer has been a special friend to me and I appreciate him he's been there as somebody that uh I truly have confidence in amen and and I I appreciate his his uh Ministry and and the ministry that ised me uh as a young Minister and in my ups and downs and my mistakes he's always been a friend and I appreciate that because I make mistakes I I might be the only one in here but I do make mistakes and and uh and I I I just appreciate brother Homer and our church we send greetings from each one of them they wanted to be sure and tell brother Homer hello and some of the things they told me to tell him I can't do because he likes his hair too much they told me to ruffle his hair and everything else but you all understand that being from here so amen do you love him amen I I just want to I want to uh just quote a couple scriptures to you you can stand if you will I'm just going to read one verse out of Matthew 13 and6 and then I'm going to let you be seated and read a few more verses out of Matthew 16 Matthew 13 and 16 says but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear you can be seated may the Lord bless you in his word I'm sorry that you just found it by the time you got seated but amen we do understand food's Des do I have to use this one all right we're on the third one first poll second pole third pole amen we're there it's blue amen all right so Matthew 16 and13 says when Jesus came into the coast of of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias others Jeremiah or one of the prophets and he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it to thee but my Father which is in heaven amen amen I I was just listening to all the things all the comments that have been said by the ministers and you know brother Dale is talking about election predestination I don't believe that that is a a a a revelation that you can say well this is cut and dried it's something that that God is continually revealing to us can you say amen and and and we just want to appreciate that this morning and I or this whatever it is uh I want to I I want to title this out of this thought what do others say what do others say now as as I already said a a young Minister can make the mistake of of thinking it's about him and begin to think that you know I I'm somebody that that carries a message that that ought to be listened to and and people ought to listen to me and in fact you see that rising up in the ministry today not so much the message but but around the Earth where there is a a refusal to acknowledge the authority of the word and really because it's a sin question can you say Amen because if you acknowledge the word you have to acknowledge the sin cuz in order to get right you have to repent you cannot get right without repenting right I read the other day day where I don't think you're mind if I mention the name but Joel Olstein was rebuking Paul and Peter and John for the things they said and I thought well you know that's going to go over good at the white Throne judgment that you know you thought because you had 30,000 in your congregation that you could change what the word says but this is the hour of unbelief that we live in this is the hour that you have to confront and and God wants us to confront it he don't want us to avoid the questions he don't want us to avoid the doubts he don't want us to avoid the rumors but he wants you to deal with it so that you know where you stand and who you believe that you can say as Paul said that I am persuaded amen so uh and then of course the leader of of the religious world the pope just made his recent comments on homosexuality and so forth and how that you know we ought not to be fixated on those things that we become narrow-minded but we ought to be broad-minded and so forth so you see everything amen is coming together it's already been spoken of amen and we are the recipients of that now I I I just tell you it's very easy to get the wrong report of something so when we're talking about Jesus walking down the road speaking with his disciples he was saying whom do men say that I am he didn't say who does God say that I am he said who do men say that I am because it's really easy to get the wrong report you know I'd heard I'd heard that brother Homer uh uh was really sick I had went on a trip and I come back and I'd heard he was really sick and then my my son was working and he come rushing him from his job and he said dad did you hear that brother Homer was in a real bad accident he's in the hospital so now Not only was brother Homer really sick he was in a in a real bad accident okay now now I know is brother Hunter we thank the Lord for for his Deliverance amen and and uh so if I had to just listened to that Source I'd have had the wrong message see it depended on what source I was getting the message from on the effect it was going to have on so what I had to do I had to call Brother Homer and ask him what yeah exactly are you almost dead so anyway we got the right story so why did Jesus want amen the disciples to confront this question why did he asked him what do men say so they said well one says you're this one one says you're that Prophet one says you're uh Jeremiah then he goes but okay now that's the rumors yeah that's what everybody else says my cousin asked me one day and I'm just speaking like this because if I get too wound up we're going to miss dinner amen my cousin asked me one day he said he said uh uh Danny are you still preaching with that William Brandon preaches and I I just be before I get into that I'll say I do it without apology amen and and so and I trust some of you would understand later but amen I'm speaking to the choir here I understand that but anyway he goes you still preaching with what that Brandon preaches and I said yes I am and I said why do you ask cuz I was curious why do you ask and he he says and this is his answer he goes because he's gone to to hell that was his answer I said you know Jimmy I wouldn't have said anything until you said that I want to ask you a question I said how much do you know about him he said well I said have you read any of his sermons listened to any of them he says well my dad read one book and said it was no good I said so now you're saying that your dad's real sick and in the hospital because he had a bad wreck did you get it I saidou saying this is all wrong because your dad said it's no good I said' now Jimmy I wouldn't have said anything I said but I'm going to prove to you that you don't even believe your Bible I said you don't even believe your Bible you only take what your Bishop tells you see because it was the it was the Corral I had come out of it was the prison house I'd been loose from so I knew what they believe there's nothing but trinitarian Pagan idolators cuz that's what you are so I said do you understand that your Bible says that the worlds were created by Jesus Christ cuz you know a trinitarian got a fundamental problem amen and he goes it don't say that I said see you don't even believe your own Bible so then he just got mad but that's not good enough you got to know and so this is what Jesus asked his disciples amen whom do men say that I am brother Tony I just skipped right over you I'm sorry God bless you this is a place of Fellowship so I got to acknowledge brother Tony amen you sat too close to the front amen so he said whom do men say that I am so some said you're this Prophet some say you're that Prophet see because he's associating his ministry with the prophets he said but who do you say that I am I want to know what you know about it amen he said you're the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus said blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah there's no Seminary has taught this to you no preacher come along and give you his private Revelation to show you who I am but it was my Father which is in heaven amen because this is not Seminary taught it's by revelation we must receive it it I'll just say this is is what the prophet said that today we stand here by the grace of God with a perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication because the whole program of God is divine revelation can you say amen I know I mean this may be just milk to you but I want to say it still must be divine revelation we've got to a place where it's we're just teaching people into to something without them having a real birth without them meeting God they don't know him anymore and the Book of Judges said that when the old men of God had died off and that's what's happening Joshua died off and all those that had seen the works of God There Rose up a generation that didn't know him so now I'm talking to a generation amen that there a second generation or they're a third generation and they only have heard about what God has done so it's got to be more more than just a Doctrine they must meet him in the power of his resurrection because you must know him by divine revelation is that all right has to be that way amen it has to be that way Amen brother bam said in this day who will have the power of infallibility hey that's some word do you know what infal ability means incapable of making an error now don't make a mistake because you're thinking of human error or human failure but this is not what he's talking about he's talking about a word that is perfect he said who will have the power of infallibility which is to be restored in the last age the last age going back to manifesting the pure word bride right I believe in Simplicity I don't believe we should confuse it up so much that we come in and listen and go out and so confused we don't have a clue what the preacher is talking about when he's talking about a pure word bride he's talking about a bride standing on the pure word can you say Amen that means we have the word again as it was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of Paul that's the promise for this hour the hour of restoration now when Jesus came it was the hour of the sacrifice that's right come on now that's it and he was asking them you were talking about Noah's day you were talking about Moses day and he was asking them what are you talking now what are they saying about my day well we understand that they talk about Moses it's so easy to talk about a past message but what is he doing today that's right his message is perfect and he always sends it in such a way that the people have a heart hard time with it they have a hard time of believing it because of how unusual it is amen now when I say unusual I don't mean immoral I don't mean of a man propping himself up and making himself uh God's Prophet while he goes out and gathers great money and rewards and great [Applause] popularity it's not what I'm talking about but it's always a message from God is always unusual and it's and this is a strange word but it's the very unusualness of it that stumbles the people and they miss it because the spirit of Revelation is not there just say how perfect this message dovet tales with the scripture remember this mess message did not come to do away with the Bible his message did not come to give a different interpretation of it I did not stop reading my Bible once I received the message amen I did not only study the message because the message came you know I've heard some ridiculous comments made brother Homer and you can throw me off anytime you want but I've heard ridiculous comments made would you rather have the Bible or the message which one would you rather have why do we even get into that sort of discussion amen but rather amen I the the message is the revealed word that reveals the written word that's what it is the message explains what the Bible means as simple as that without the message you would only have denominational perspective of the Bible you would only be trying to study the Bible to learn some good principles of how to live right amen with no real focus of God Amen as as brother Samuel is talking about the predetermination of God to bring forth a group of people that means in every age he raised the people up for a specific purpose that they were brought there to do something that in their age they would be called living Epistles they would actually be revealing what the written word was by the life that they lived do we believe that is that a little anemic that true it has to be a lived life have to be a lived voice amen and that people would actually be the Revelation brother bam said what balam failed to see when he looked down and tried to curse Israel was he failed to see that the shadow of the King was in the camp he failed to see the Brazen serpent he failed to see the prophet that was there and he only saw a human failure surely God would have to curse that look this man over here he did this surely God have look at this family over here they're going and living anyway they're doing bad business deals and whatever more surely God will have to curse that I don't care what move of God you have there's always going to be human failure amen that's right but what balam failed to see God told him God told him he said don't go down there for I have blessed those people they're carrying the blessing thank you Lord Jesus I don't care what you do I'm not going to curse them come on Hallelujah that's right that's what he said read your Bible but see because balam loved money did he heard he had a greater offer so he went back and he and he told God can I go you know and God says go but you're only going to say what I tell you to say now balum if youve ever understood he's the first recorded uh record we have in the Bible of the First Act of road rage did you know that it's ABS absolutely abolutely right First Act of rotor and it wasn't with another driver is with his with his vehicle his vehicle you know this is a crazy thing you see and so but when he tried to get up there to curse Israel from all these different points he couldn't do it God would not allow him and he failed to see what was actually there right and it's always been that way in every age men fail to see what's actually here on slow down for the next seven minutes now here we come to Jesus and they're failing to see the same thing well they've heard that there's there's a man in the area that's got this the signs and wonders are following him but there's a lot of reports coming out that's really strange how we going to understand hundreds even thousands flocking to see him because of The Healing Ministry that accompanies him Supernatural is always attractive but we've heard many things about him that we're not sure of we've heard that his own Hometown won't have nothing to do with him we've heard reports that he's a Samaritan and we've heard reports that he was bored of illegitimate birth we've heard a lot of strange things about him and on top of that he comes out of Galilee and search the scripture No Prophet Rises out of Galilee now I'm one the reason I'm saying that brother and sister I want to tell you how blessed you are to even be in a position to hear it correctly right amen you understand how little they actually knew about Jesus but they're thinking of him was shaped by somebody else's opinion that's how powerful you are that you can give an opinion it'll shape somebody else's idea about it there's fear to even believe in that man because of the repercussions it's going to have in our life our churches have warned us against him said if you actually believe what he said you're out of here you're no longer part of the synagogue you say well where's that brother Danny John N read your Bible it's there then on top of that we hear there's a lot of his own Believers that are leaving him that he says strange things that they don't understand so they said you know after a while they finally figure out this man's a false prophet so they turn and leave him am man 70 of them turned and walked away they said it's a hard saying who can hear it ask yourself this question would you have stayed with Jesus when those questions are flooding out about him when they're making their own believe the sign websites back there amen are you going to believe in the in the in the manifested work of God in that hour because you have to identify yourself where you stand but how you are now and when Jesus said except you e My Flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me and he never even gave them the kindness of explaining that to them Jesus must have been on a time constraint too they had dinner coming up as well so he just said eat my flesh drink my blood you have no life in me okay let's go on to the next Point yeah and those disciples said you're not going to explain that to us give us show us the proof what do you mean Jesus didn't have to because Jesus knew that if he could persuade them in they could be persuaded out that no soul will ever be won by argument but it's the power of the seed what you have inside of you on Jesus turned after his church had got really small he turned and looked at them and said are you going to go as well and Peter said Lord where are we going to go you alone have the words of eternal life there is nowhere else to go I can't go back to the Baptist I can't go back to the Pentecostal I can't go back to some camp this is the only thing that gives me life you should have a response on that for your own self this is the only thing where life comes from this is the only source of life so all of these things that are happening in his ministry Miracles the voices some say as an angel speaks to him voices Out of Heaven speak to him it's all strange a cultish on I had a had a 14 or 15y old girl out of my own church said oh I studied the message and it's and it's it's has all the ear marks of Ault and I laughed I said you studied the message I tell you what you studied you studied what kind of pants you wanted to wear you st you study what kind of makeup you wanted to put on you did not study the message come on church it's a love for the world not for the things of God so who are you going to serve then of course all the Learned people of that hour the Learned people they said now listen you're going to have blame this on God cuz I was not preaching this so that's right he just told me this morning in prayer brought this on my heart so it's your fault so then the scribes of that hour the Learned ones the theologians the studiers the scribes they should know who he is that's who I'm going to put my trust in they're the ones that are trained in the difficult things of Moses law to explain it to the people surely they recognized who he was amen and then look at the proof in the message itself there's even disagreements among the disciples so I want to ask you if you had been there and asked one of those people about Jesus what you'd heard about him would have depend where they saw him that's right right what if the person you asked was one of the scribes what if the person you asked was one of the 70 right hallelujah what if the person you asked was one of those mocking him and laughing at him depends how you hear blessed are your eyes for they see the things of God blessed are your ears for they hear the things of God we are blessed amen so you have all of this and I we're taught that there is a man by the name of blind bmus I got one minute it's gonna be a good story there's a man by the name of blind Bas that he had been taught by his mother about about how God was and how he acted said he' been taught about all the supernatural things that took place in the wilderness journey and then you're familiar how he sat there on that rock and he's thinking oh if I could only have been there then he begins to think about Joshua and how he had met in that same city at the walls how he had met the captain of the Lord's host yes sir and he said if I could have only been there he could have given me my sight and he said little did he know that just a few hundred yards away the captain the host was coming his way and as he's sitting there in his blindness his natural blindness he's sitting there thinking about his condition he hears noises beginning to swell around him now he has a good foundation under him because he's been taught amen and he's listening to all the noises pretty soon hears shouting begin to come and mocking and hear somebody say oh we heard about this man named Lazarus that you raised him from the dead why don't you come over here we got a whole graveyard over here why don't you raise them yeah heard others mocking him and he somebody comes by him and he asks who is that what's going on and he said oh it's Jesus of Nazareth he's passing by and he'd heard about him now what if his idea of Jesus had been one of the critics what what if his idea of Jesus had been one of those throwing the tomatoes what if the idea of Jesus had been one of the disciples that had walked away and started their website what if his idea of Jesus would have been that but it wasn't his idea of Jesus was pure that he believed that he's the same yesterday today and forever can you say Amen see these these disciples that walked away from Jesus didn't have a pure heart if they was really right or true in their intent they said what Gia said that's right Gia said listen if this is of god you better not fight it let you fight against God and if it's not of God it'll just die out leave it alone but they don't take the advice amen so here's this man thinking on the Supernatural and the Supernatural is coming to him and when he hears amen the cries of the crowd he joined his voice with it yeah but where was his voice coming from Revelation and Revelation can only come to you by the Almighty I can't give it to you but he can and he screamed out thou son of David have mercy on meall you still have that same amen pull on God and here's the Lord Jesus enclosing walking amen toward Jerusalem the sins of the world on him the critics screaming at him the website set up to stop him and as he's walking up the up there he hears the cry maybe he was in Ohi Alabama he heard a cry and he stopped and he turned with all the sins of the world piled up upon him he stopped why it was the predestinated son of God stopping for a predestinated voice that would come come out in that [Applause] hour you understand your voice is predestinated to sound out call on that great gift of God thou son of David said what will you have me do he didn't say listen I'm too busy I'm going up to Calvary I don't have time for you you're a beggar you're not a social standing I don't have time for you I've got more important things to argue about and talk about and think about I got great message I'm going to ride a donkey into Jerusalem here and they're going to be worshiping here in just a little bit no no he never said that he said what would you have me do for you think about it God himself asking him come on come on come on God saying what do you want from me you know what he said I I want to know if all these rumors are true it's not what he said that's your problem you're too intellectual if Moses walked up to that burning bush and asked why it was burning amen God would have turned and walked away from him but he did exactly what that voice said and that same voice and the Man Called Jesus said what would you have me do and he said I want my sight that's what the revealed word of the hour is for brother and sister it's not about argument it's about sight setting the captive free so what position are you hearing it from this morning let's

woman trying to cast it out you still believing that here trying to cast it out he said and finally that demon spoke out of that woman in a man's voice and said she's mine and I'm not coming out and you can't make me leave he said and I didn't know what to do so I thought and I thought I had an idea and this is going to seem strange to you he said I went and got a book of brother brms I had a picture of him in it and I brought it back and I opened it up to that picture and I held it up to that woman I said do you know who this man is this is strange yeah come on Master he said that demon spoke out in that man's voice and said that's William brandham I was K I was I was thrown out of one of his meetings in Arkansas and so that old Mexican preacher said this he said then in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ whom William Brandon preached come out of her and he said the demon came out didn't come out because of brother brandom but it because it came out because he knew that that what that man stood for was the Living God not a Creed not a Dogma right right but the voice of God that could free you from the house of hell yes might seem strange to some of you this morning but what do
