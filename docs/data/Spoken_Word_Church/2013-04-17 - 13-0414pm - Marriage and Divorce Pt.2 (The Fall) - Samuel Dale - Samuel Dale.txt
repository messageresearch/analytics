just hold on a little longer help is on the way i had another one in here we just go to e-flat fits anytime let's all stand and like great my first i am is praise god praise god praise god god praise god is is amen amen amen you know you're a child of the king now oh my hallelujah open the eyes of my heart open the and how shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love amen in the light of your glory do you love him want oh see amen and amen and amen i want to see him don't you good to see everybody in the house of the lord if you'd like to turn in matthew 19 again we'll be reading this scripture probably for a while to be speaking on the series on marriage and divorce and like i say i don't have any bones to pick with anybody i don't have don't want to think of have a private doctrine about marriage and divorce i may think of things in one way and you and another uh is doing it but i hope they don't pull apart i hope they all come together to make a beautiful picture to where we can study the word of the lord and and do and i've always been one person to be one thing if i'm wrong now if i'm not wrong you tell me i'm wrong i don't like that you don't either okay but if i'm wrong and you tell me i'm wrong i don't have any problems because i know i'm wrong so anybody would have any marital problems and things it's not the bible and the prophet or me or anybody trying to condemn you it's it's all trying to be straight now it's like i've said it i believe it i believe that if we don't have the correct understanding of marriage and divorce and get all things straight in our lives uh you you're going to differ with me i'm sure but i i believe we're going to go by the grave that's right i believe the ones who stand in the moment of twinkling of an eye to be changed are going to have everything straight and right you know and doing right now i didn't say you wouldn't go in the rapture that's don't accuse me of stuff just take what i say if i have a problem and i won't get it corrected then i may have to go by the grave well because i believe that the ones that will be changed i'm going to trinkle and i will be a world-born bride walking and everything would have also preached to you it's not going to be a perfect zombie looking thing we're going to be human the prophet said stickers until we're changed all right but we need to get everything right while we're here right now because it's not you're going somewhere else and try to pull a court of appeal and you know and get something right it's either made right here or we're going to answer for it so i'd rather have it somebody to tell me the truth here you know and let me make my own mind of what to do and everything then to leave me and not tell me because if i don't tell you the blood's on me you know so that's you know that's just the basis of it okay matthew 19 remember now the fellowship meeting will be here on the third saturday and remember the cash family there and the loss of the of his father and just pray that the lord would bless all of them and remember the sick among us but remember the bible said he sent his word and healed us so i believe it he said his word to heal us i believe that don't you matthew 19. father we thank you for your love and your understanding thank you for the day that we can truly stand and say the correct answer for all things has been given into our hands we may not know all the answers that's no problem father but we know a god that has all the answers and then he can give and give them unto us in our our needful times maybe sometimes we don't need answers maybe our questions is what holds us in line to keep us to waiting is our time to be for you to answer us but we just ask you to have your way now bless the cast family there lord and be with each and every one we love you and we thank you father let your grace be sufficient in jesus name amen matthew 19 we'll begin verse 3. and the pharisees also came unto him tempting him remember this morning not tempting him wouldn't care about what he said he would just tend to try to try to catch him some way or to show how smart they were you know tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife forever cause no huh moses never never said it that way uh because if you don't believe it now i wrote this in my bible where it says there where it says can you put away a man forever calls read verse 9 sometimes where it says and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication so jesus wasn't telling them it's all right for everything he put it in order like we've talked about this morning all right and the answer and said unto them have you not read that he that made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore there are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let no man let not man put asunder they say unto him why did moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away he saith unto them moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so amen you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now we put a lot of information this morning i've already got a bunch of questions and i'll try to answer along the way but my whole sum of it until uh do we finish up into the series or something but and i enjoy questions because that means you're thinking right you know and and i hope you was following me this morning in the lineup and if i don't even get into the notes for this afternoon's message i want to make sure you follow me not to say i've never asked anybody to believe me all right i don't ask my wife to believe me i don't ask my kids grandkids and all the daughter-in-law son-in-laws i don't ask them to believe me i ask them to listen sit down think it over and let god speak to them because they take it on the basis well daddy said it or papa said it or something then you just build on a man and see i'm afraid that's what has happened basically with the people of the message that they just say brother branham said it right and that's wonderful but he also said in marriage and divorce he said if this is not revealed to you right amen marriage and divorce has to be revealed not just read it quote it but it'll be revealed he said it was a and it said because of a supernatural revelation because of the opening of the seven seals i say unto you all right now if the seals had not never broken unto him then he could have never told us those things but they were broke and brought forth the open word that would show him the truth all right so then we need to seek god for revelation well brother dale i i i'm pure wonderful wonderful that's great wonderful person could be able to stand there but just make sure you don't have any closets is that our terminologies for things that we have shelved away somewhere that we maybe think they're not too important but they may be as we go along because you know you sisters you could say well i was a virgin when i married well praise the lord can you quote with the prophet though he said a kiss is a potential adultery i mean can you quote that away see all right see that's that's a long gap and remember now brother dale's not the kind it just preaches against women okay like i said this morning they want to make women to be a a piece of hamburger meat you know but the man he's a t-bone steak man he's he's yeah my mother used to make a statement she said did a man go out and live and do all he wants to and go put on a suit of clothes go to church he's called a brother he said let a woman do one mistake since she's an adulteress rest of her life well that's true but see i don't preach this those things against women remember you men are the cause too the woman can't do very much by herself that's plain language but it's true you know all right that's right and see then that's you know they had to be a beast and we'll get to you know it wasn't something he had in her own so just remember we're not picking on women we're trying to find the truth because remember in the body of christ we are feminish come on amen and if you'll read marriage and divorce you'll find brother brown especially that in invisible union puts a lot of emphasis upon the spiritual side of spiritual adultery and how that we've got to confess everything before we can be married to christ the word see he's just not picking on just the women you know that's that's the point but now back up into what we were talking about this morning that said they said you know a man could just put away his wife for any cause well then why would in the same point i didn't read it this morning but you know i was quoting it there a minute ago verse nine which is right on over from this verse three and i say unto you so put away his wife except it be for confornique in other words for any other reason to fornication he commenced adultery that's adultery is the act all right now then that way it's not for just anything but yet they took it right and made it to be for anything see that they wanted all right now you see that among the people of the message you know you see a man maybe have one i have in mind had about 10 kids with his first wife and you know finally one day he decided to put her away and get him another one because she she would have done something wrong before they married but we found out probably she told him about it well now she told him about it and he forgave her how can he use it against her nose see i'm sorry see people are saying well i've got a right i'm right i know you can't tell me heard a man one day say that he said you can't tell me whether i got a right to marry or not mayor whatever i'm not going to try to you know but your own conscience or to condemn you if you don't it's like the prophet said you don't have no more conscience than a snake's got hips and so that's pretty blunt but now think about it jesus said go back to the beginning and look at the beginning and see if there's anything in the beginning because that's the seed chapter of it all right and i had these written down this morning kind of had to run through real fights but i had a bunch of questions you know to ask you i ran into it real quick but i want to go over it was there anything wrong in how god created adam and eve in the original creation you know eve in adam was anything wrong with that it was not according to the other creations right because he created male and female but when it comes to mankind he created adam and eve was in adam was anything wrong with that no then was there anything wrong in the fact that eve was taken from adam placed with adam in the garden and she would be a byproduct of adam right because you're the byproduct of your mom and daddy me see we use that byproduct as trying to use it as a bad thing but you need to go looking where i don't need rapster tell me i got a revelation all right my hands up you remember that this morning you just crossed yourself because if you can't take what you got by the english language what language you're going to put it in if in the english language a dog means a uh what a dog would mean a cat or a cat would mean a horse or what you got to have some form of language the prophet spoke in the english language all right now in doing that then we've got to get it to the right way there was nothing wrong when eve was taken from adam there's no sin and if you make her as i said this morning if you make her some outlandishly wrong thing as just a part of coming out of adam the then you're making god the author of whatever you're trying to say if you're saying that she was made so uh you know outlandishly sexy or whatever then you're making god the author of that see that's where you don't people don't even think about what they're saying they just say what they want to say and forget the rest but now watch in the original creation of adams and animals was there anything wrong in the way that the horses the dogs the cats etc were made they were made male and female they were made that way for a purpose what was that purpose for reproduction right because you know we get all these stories we look up all these things try to figure it out but the bible said he made male and female you know all right now then was there anything wrong with the fact that the male and female horse in that original creation was made and designed to reproduce come on the prophet said nothing in original creation right all right was there anything wrong with the female horse you know the male horse having a a relationship we call it for babies no that was all those four babies all right you go out yourself and you see it you you go out and you look at your dog said dog don't dier come to that female dog i mean you go to the lion which is the great big king that would want one thing and he could just kill a female but he won't touch that female she'll wear him out right but at a certain time then she comes to him and i was explaining to the bear especially into that because a lot of the animals do these things um you know there's amazing things in the animal kingdom that has come because of the fall we'll get to that i'm not going to express that this afternoon but because of the fall they get to a lot of things um that old boy buyer he'll he'll kill that baby it was his own baby that he had by her he'll kill it to worry she'll become receptive you know what she'll fight him to the death but then once that baby's dead and she's gone from in a while she'll go back and look up the bear because she's receptive again now that that is part of what you would call the the the you know the part of being a mother or being the instinct welling dwelling within them that is you know is dire you know because of the fall i ask you the question this morning that because of that fall polygamy comes into being but how did it come into being in the animals what caused them to go wrong see there's a lot of questions you know but i think if we get down far enough to find out what it is and what really happened in the garden we might find out a lot about other things too was there anything wrong with the animals being created with the desire or are you know thing to reproduce the only thing you can say that went wrong with eve is what i tried to bring out by being that she was created she was made with the ability to reason i hope he was listening to that very carefully adam evidently finally had the ability to reason because he did but yet he wouldn't listen to satan i remember one brother in this message used to preach it that that there was a male and a female beast well evidently there was because the bible says he made two you know male and female of each one and and the old brother used to preach and he had that female beast just flirting all around adam but it didn't bother adam he didn't reason but when the beast got around eaves he began to reason well we'll see we want to make everything so wrong but remember adam in the beginning he didn't let any reasoning come to pass you know he would not accept it you and i have that same thing right we can say yes or no about anything but yet if we begin to reason on it right see that's where we messed up was there anything wrong with eve having a motherly ability no she was created for that but see satan seduced her made her to start to think him and not being in the original creation when she was brought forth she was not a low degraded discrepant prostitute well yet that's what satan done brother brother says satan designed her have you noticed that marriage in divorce now did satan stand with god you know now you make her this way where i can get to her this way where i can do this now how did satan have anything to do with designing eve you should probably say satan designed her were in the fall come on in the fall he began to put into her mind his design his thoughts but not in the original creation let's see if we could stay that way what would it have been well we see we take my product and we say well that's what that's what it does she just made a bra well be careful you're going to have god creating her wrong but when he gave her a free moral agent see i got a question on that question was in the beginning of reason was it because she was a free moral agent that's exactly right adam now listen adam wasn't a free moral agent now you don't argue with me but listen to my point adam didn't have a choice for a wife right he didn't have a right to choose who he wanted see he never went into free world agency until she come into being and she come into being with a free moral agency and by using her free moral agency she caused him to walk into a freemore agency himself right right so to nazi you're gonna have god creating wrong instead of god creating her giving her body spirit and soul and that way she could reason all right that would be the original sin then it's the reason he said wait a minute now the bible says yeah i know blood bible the bible tells you not to reason right cast down reasoning yet it turns around and it says come let us reason together according to what you're doing with it right it's got a lot to do with it but see by being a free moral agent then eve could accept reasoning and when she did she went into the perversion so you ask most people even in this message what is the seed of the serpent you know and they'll explain to you the sex act that took place by even the beast right and that's the way most people do it but you see the seed of the serpent that's why i gave you that quote this morning tied with marriage and divorce but around said the seed of the serpent comes into view see the seed of the serpent was the reasoning that satan placed in the mind of eve you understand amen see we say we're deceived sure all of us humanly speaking these bodies came by eve and the beast let me put it correctly though even satan right around and said not even the beast because everybody's not off even the beast some are vegan the beast and some are even adam because that's a genetic makeup but it's so much infiltrated together until you can't separate it no more but it's even the serpent that brought us wrong right all right now this is the one i had this morning but didn't have time to brother random says prayer of page 216 215 excuse me church age book and that weakness in her allowed satan to seduce her by way of the serpent and has brought the woman to a very peculiar position before god in his word she is the type of all things vulgar fowl loves loathsome on the one hand and on the other hand she is the type of all-time clean and beautiful and holy now so we can get our own little reasonings in and you know by doing that we decide which one we want to be whether we want to be the vulgar lowsome or whatever all right i'll get to this in a minute more but was this was the act between even the beast the seed of the serpent no that was the seed of the beast come on you got to think cain came from the beast that was his father right right amen see abel came from adam that was his father that's not the seed of the serpent satan don't have a physical seed amen so the seed of the serpent is different from the seed of the beast the seed of the serpent is not a physical germs genes whatever you want to call all those words it makes up a a seed the seed of the serpent was where satan went straight to eve's reasoning factor that's right all right it caused her to commit adultery you see to the serpent is unbelief amen that's the only seed satan has he has no ability to produce another child that's right so right brother said in the church eight book he said so thereby he vicariously used the beast to bring to pisces to inject himself into the human race so separate your thoughts what is the seed of the serpent unbelief what is the seed of the beast cain that's what he wound up being with him because it was a sex act all right we're just dealing back there to try to find out what the fall is today let's read a few things about this because you may not agree to what i was bringing out this morning and then started doing over again that in the animal kingdom the female was given to the male to reproduce the male right right all right now i like to cover things where the people that are carnality won't jump up a worm can be both male or female but that's still a male and female irregardless what you want to do with it right it's still a male and a female it don't matter if it's all the same worm i just do that word that somebody come along on the internet and they say boy you don't know what he's talking about but listen then the reproduction of the animal was the purpose of the fact of them being made male and female well was it not the same for eve and adam as i said this morning i keep saying it whether it would be a literal act between the two or whether they spoke the child into existence it'd still take both of them if you want my opinion adam was having to wait until eve come to the right place she just didn't make it if she'd come to the right place they would have been the babies spoken into existence or whatever you want to call it you argue that point i'm just a preacher well let's see what brother branham said about this by-product and what her purpose was go ahead with number one brother over you must be born again paragraph or e34 58 619 b he looked wonderful but he was lonesome talking about the man the creation the birds flew out he wooed over them the animals came forth he kept cooing and a man came up he looked wonderful but he was lonesome he he had no help mate so to see that i want you to be real sticky now i want this to be real sticky now god never put the woman in the original creation all right she's a byproduct of the man man and woman was one a woman in the beginning he took the woman from adam and a man and wife are really one he's not degrading the byproduct he's putting it to a position that we read this morning where that right around said that she was co-equal in her natural creation now my point of co-equal we were asking some questions some talking while ago and i love that but when you look at adam and eve as co-equal i'm funny i know natural i don't believe when she was made co-equal that meant both of them was exactly the same height and both of them looked exactly like sorry you know what i believe if you ever want to see a woman that was under subjection to her husband eve was one before the fall okay adam was her head he's like the hens the rooster the head the horse you know the prophet he said all the animal kingdom all of the females were uglier than the male but said in the human kingdom she's made beautiful that would've been a wonderful thing to be able to go back and see adam and eve in the garden and how long they were and brother around said god would come down in the cool of the evening and say my children have you enjoyed your day in the garden yes father we've enjoyed it he said come and lay them down and they go to sleep you've heard brother branham say that eve would say adam it's a little windy today and he'd say peace be still see she didn't stop that let's go don't go change that wind no that didn't come until the fall so if we're going back the other way maybe your sister's order to consider that point go back and let your husband be the head now that's not saying it the way it needs to be said oh you know like a lady said one time said i let my husband be my head now you don't let god be your head you don't let your husband be your head he is either your head or he's not your head and if he's not your head you the head everybody look around grin at each other but think about it the woman in the beginning he took the woman from adam pull it back up brother and the man and wife are really one but that was done to reproduce themselves again to put them in the flesh in flesh but he took the feminist part of the man and made a woman out of it now is there anything wrong with her is she standing there by product right went through part of this one this morning but go ahead with number two pergamon church age page 171 church age book that'd be number two the first son adam was the spoken seed word of god he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of god but she failed by her hybridizing she caused him to die we know that's what happened but she was to reproduce him he gave you this one this morning what number three questions and answered on hebrews what have we got paragraph 393 he was in he was he has a spirit in him a man does when he's born because he's the spirit of nature it's the spirit of the world that's the spirit of the god of this world he's merely an offspring of adam all right the tree reproduces itself vegetation reproduces animals reproduce themselves humans reproduce themselves there are the byproduct of original creation says he get it you're a byproduct of your mom and daddy does that make the byproduct a bad thing no right what they done they what eve done now can i say just a few natural words the animals in the garden must have been reproducing before the fall and you say well how do you know that well maybe just a simple little reasoning factor all right oh we're not supposed to reap well just listen and see where did all them other extra animals wind up in the book of genesis if there was only one male and one female all right where did god get those animals that he slew the skin took the skins off of them and clothed adam and eve it's simple it takes simple logic a lot of times and answers a lot of questions that's right oh but i got to get a revelation when you can't get a revelation until you get a head knowledge because god don't drop it down out of the sky to you all right so here we are in the garden with adam and eve was going to in one way or the other she was going to reproduce adam the other animals were already reproducing and the beast that's what he could explain he knew she had a now here's the problem he said satan had a knowledge of the principles of life okay you need that quote i'll be glad to get it for you so by doing that he knew how to get to eve so he begins to get her to reason over everything and he says that's what you're right for and he could turn around and since you see the animals and said they're reproducing and there wasn't anything wrong with it was it still not anything wrong with the animals reproducing right that's nature so the beast he had something to get her to reason about and you got her to reason to the fact of what she was there for and her motherly instinct began to move and when it did it caused a fall to take place but now it wasn't no five minute of fire i don't believe right don't tell them how long satan reasoned with eve because when he first told her about it she probably said ain't listening to you but then she began to reason and to take into consideration and you know what what he was telling her was the truth are you with me yes was he telling her a lie no he was telling her the animals are doing it and you're made for that to reproduce adam with no lie in that the bible had done told them genesis 1 26-27 or 27-28 then multiply and replenish the earth while she was in adam and theophany she was told to multiply and replenish and when he come into flesh you don't want your modification but then when the when the flood came and mankind went forth it was told our in scripture you know multiply and replenish the earth all right but now what went wrong was with him telling her what she was made for and she began to reason upon that factor right instead of waiting for adam is that the words of the prophet do you need that so she didn't wait for adam but now listen as she begin to reason now it's in here somewhere if i miss it don't have time you you you just ask me later don't you but around said it's impossible for a woman to have an affair with a man until she first accepts him in her mind you are not talking about a rape right i will get to that when we're going along a girl that is raped is not she hasn't lost anything right we will get down to that because she can't help it he said well she don't have this but your reasoning but listen what is sin what is sin we can all quote quickly that it's unbelief can't we yes but why don't we quote that the serpent seed is sin unbelief instead of quoting the serpent seed is a literal act i hope that dwelled on you a minute ago eve had a relationship with a beast that brought cain into the line right but she had the original sin which is unbelief she took that beast's idea into her being and and become so engulfed with it until she finally produced it same as the prophet said a woman can't have a relationship until she first has one in her mind so let's read a few things now let's think about just keep our thoughts on this unbelief a minute go ahead with number four the results of sin are executing the results of a decision 55 1008 paragraph 73 there's only one sin and that sin is unbelief smoking cigarettes drinking whiskey telling lies committing adultery now what did we start off with that eve done it we'll get back to it eve committed adultery her committing adultery is not sin it's an attribute she had already sinned or she would not have let the adulterous act taken place that's why i emphasize that committed that's not sin that's attributes of sin you do that because you're a sinner that's what makes you do it see not sin itself that's just what the distraught results are sin now and the only sin there is is unbelie is his unbelief he that believeth not is condemned already in jesus matthew saint john 3 see you've got to you you don't believe there's only two facilities right you pronounce it one of them is unbelief and the other one is faith if you believe you are if you do not believe you are not that's the only thing see we need to get down you remember brother branham talking about that one day he's preaching away and he's talking about whiskey drinking and no it's not a sin and little sister brother branham what is sin he says unbelief see we've been taught all of our life right you're going to die and go to hell for commitment adultery you won't die and go to hell for smoking drinking we standing one day at my mother-in-law's and the neighbor was cutting grass there was a lady visiting with my mother-in-law and him she said one of these days he'll die and go to hell for that it's kind of no sunday see that was her he gonna die and go to hell he now no hopes he cut his grass on sunday we life at that but still how much does that bear upon our mind you know that some people believe the reason they're saved is because they've never done anything wrong true we find out that's not exactly what fits is it that's right we don't justify doing wrong but it's always one that done more wrong is more it i have to get forgiveness because they want it right but do we actually understand that there's only one sin and that's unbelief now you can see what he's done see by that you can see what happened to eve and you can see that that still happens to you and i uh he said but i'm a christian did your prophet make this statement he said only christians have sins but i can't sin bless god i know better than that where'd you get it from what school did you go to i went to the bible the bible said it it seems reminiscent oh it says if it sees remains in you you cannot sin it didn't say you can't sin show me a scripture says you can't sin we just don't put it to the sin of blaspheming the sin of total unbelief because anything's not a faith is sin i ate too much at lunch i should have had one hamburger i ate two i know better i'll burp he said well that's silly no anything's not a faith is sin so don't worry about trying to figure out whether you sinned or not just remember you already are he's born that way all right but do you understand those things are not sin they're attributes of unbelief now if you tell me say well brother dale define a little bit darlin are you saying that it's okay to go out and commit adultery as long as you say i believe no no don't accuse me of stupidity dumb yeah stupid see when you go back to the garden and you ask people what happens you have to match most of the people in the medicine what happened in the garden to cause all this trouble he had a relationship with the beast that's all i know right see she had her spiritual intercourse with satan in her mind did you understand the words i used spiritual intercourse with satan in her mind did she begin to reason you don't have a reason i wonder what the world brotherdale's getting at that's pretty good reason all of the things let me explain this one going over to number eight where i get back and preach a little over to number eight which is from the spoken words original seed book two 1962 318 paragraph 180 through 180 we let the prophet say it that's how adultery just a minute he's explaining it right that's how adultery is committed spiritually when you knowing better by the word of god by the intercourse of the mind take in a lie of the devil against the word of god now if we do that we're unbelievers now the if i don't know the bible says so and so you know when i'm doing those things i'm not an unbeliever right but when knowledge comes i can prove whether or not i'm believer or not look what he says see knowing better by the word of god by the intercourse of the mind taking a lie of the devil against the word of god that's exactly what he's done with a spiritual intercourse first that come by believing satan's lie into the wound of her mind that polluted her soul set death in the soul and the natural natural act taken place now and that's the only way that a woman can ever commit adultery against her husband is to first let some man talk her into it and then receive another man that's not her husband then she's committed adultery and well i got you there brother dale because you believe the soldier okay just don't crow remember up until 1962 about the greatest battle ever fought brother random was teaching that you're a triune being he says your body soul spirit but then after 62 long in the greatest battle ever fought he began to explain and said you're a triune being your body spirit and soul so now we need back your dealing about eve it was her second part of her being that reasons right no matter what you call it brother branham always gave five senses for the outside man five senses for the second part of man no matter what he called it soul or spirit and one sense for the soul or the intervening so he's talking about eve in the reasoning into her mind she accepted satan's lie and she did then she had the natural act with the beast that was talking to her do you see what happened in the garden you see where unbelief is the original sin and you see unbelief then is the serpent seed because that's the only seed he has is this the seed of disbelief he has no word of his own don't thought of his own he perverts god's word amen but he'll tell you the 99.99 truth as i said while ago about him did the devil tell eve wrong he told her what the animals were doing he told her what she was capable of doing he just didn't tell her that it was the wrong way of going about it with him right what is it then brother brown says on the imagine divorce we read it this morning it's a foremost question in everybody's mind he said believers and not unbelievers he's called unbelievers don't care but he said believers are always wanting to be concerned about themselves right you don't have a conscious part about you that is desiring to do good you you don't have something to condemn you when you do do wrong even the moral obligation of a human being is to do good i told you when i was a center i'd go out and do things wrong i'd come home i felt dirty i felt and i would actually i didn't know how to crowd to god but i would be sorry for what i'd done and there were some things i didn't do because of a moral obligation i would not in no way ever fool with a married woman that was a built inside of me thing that would not i didn't have to decide whether or to or not that was already decided but listen church eve committed adultery that's what brought forth the first child which was cain come on that's marriage and divorce paragraph 58. that's what brought cain the unbelief she had is what brought death upon all mankind the act was the attribute right drinking gambling smoking is what attributes of unbelief you do it because you're not a believer brother dale i believe it's wrong to do that we'll quit it's no problem quit blocking we'll go get help i never did figure out how you could chew on a blue cigarette and claim to be smoking and it'd satisfy you but you know i mean i've always just been dogmatic i guess if it didn't fit i just took it off you know i don't like tight clothes and stuff like that it don't fit now i don't want to handle none of it but listen church what was the fall in the garden he said it was just an act between a beast and an eve now that's the attribute that's what happened because of the fall she had already fallen it didn't matter whether she went and had the act or not you want scripture for it i thought jesus said if you look on a woman to lust after in your heart you've already committed adultery that's what i thought he said it didn't matter what he'd done after she had taken satan's lie she had already brought sin unbelief upon mankind she died right there we know she did not physically but she set death in the human race so that's why you get into it and see that you can be forgiven of all sin except what now come on and you've got a marriage problems or hat or whatever you're not going to die and go to hell because of your marital problem if you did that would put salvation and things up on the basis of what you do or don't do well we're going to die and go to hell for unbelief all right and if we don't believe god made a way and what's the problem with serving him that's right i said this morning thinking about that brothers spending so much time going through the bible taking little things this one said this and this one said this oh man look look at it brother have you have you seen that video he explains on there all of these wrongs in the bible and he's also explained now brother brandon was wrong he's also explained how jesus was wrong and but he's real popular he said what are you calling him i call him nothing ain't going to call him either but listen church unbelief he that believeth not is condemned already well let me ask you a simple question of you to think about seriously anywhere you was at or any time you came to salvation you know what was you thinking about when you were trying to deal with the lord about salvation you were thinking about what you'd done wrong is that true lord i might not have been like some of these others but i've got some bad problems right when you start talking about salvation people immediately we all do i do we think about what we've done or didn't do how many times have you ever heard me make this statement if you ever thank god for bringing you out of a denominational church i really seriously thank them and you know how i preach it i don't preach the wrong of all of that they had their times and they're still good people out there wonderful people but yet when you're caught by denominational fornication spirit you're in unbelief and unbelief is sin now you could tell jesus that he was wrong about oh creating wine he did that didn't he you know someone probably got drunk off the wine he created you could condemn him about uh beating the money changers running them out of the temple well that was that was happening to people the people couldn't go out here and do all this right that happened to people they were doing a good job he said you made my house a a den of thieves well you know in the natural what they were doing is pocketing the money that was coming in they didn't turn it into the priests to give it over to the to the temple it's taking a little out of the tale of it but you know what i love about the scripture jesus said one day he said the devil cometh and have nothing in me he said show me where i've ever disbelieved right is that jesus talking show me wherever disbelieved yet you could tell him all about what he done you see church we need to get down to find out what sin really is well you think it's all right just go out and do anything you want to i didn't know i said that does anybody anybody get that out of what i've said well you're just saying it's not sin no it's not sin you're an unbeliever that's the reason you drink and smoke and run around you're an unbeliever get to be a believer he'll take care of it amen see that only one sin a sin of unbelief there wasn't any sin in the way was created oh we've been through that now two services is what she done with it there's nothing more beautiful than a a pure virgin young girl a great honor you know that brother random even explains that my wife being a virgin when we married if i die she could marry again right scripturally she could marry again you know she's still a virgin if she was one to start with she's a virgin second he dies the third one you remember they got into it the brother died this and died who's gonna be when we get over there you know he said this ain't no giving in marriage or anything we're not gonna be there as husband and wife now we will be recognized as husband and wife but not to be there as husband and wife for reproduction because he already tried to think ahead what you're thinking see when you say a man and his wife is the type of christ in the church david with his thousand wives he was the type of christ in the church is him being one because they couldn't help no other husband he said yeah but there's brother random got two wives not at the same time you better back up not at the same time one died he was able to marry again that's scripturally legal all right but you say well when we get to heaven is he going to have two wives why would you think like that well i i want to know who i'm going to be with when i get there why there won't be no kids born in heaven there won't be no desires and thoughts and ideas that's right amen you know the thing you can find where brother brown said it this way he said but we will have clothes on when we get there the ones he saw beyond the curtain of time had on long robes we ain't going to be there naked running around we don't come through all of that we're supposed to be going to perfection not if there'll be any sex acts or thoughts and ideas there it's just a form of what we've done you see church there's a lot of things maybe that needs to be explained about marriage and divorce we'll try to go through a few things but just like today i just wanted to bring it out and showed it in the beginning it wasn't so and run said and it won't be so over there so you can see people's mind is what you you don't have to have discernment you don't have to discern and see what people thinking look at their face we were sitting one day talking about going to hell when you heard me say it and this lady she wasn't much of a christian but you know she kind of thought about her body being beautiful well something was said and you could just see it on her i'll be beautiful freckles are beautiful did you understand what i just said molds are a perversion of life but freckles is not necessarily perversion right right but you see church we want to put everything into our own little cubicle our own little thinking and ideas well you're just destroying my idea oh thank god what are you going to do about it see because when we start explaining brother brown starts explaining that the drinking gambling smoking is not seeing people boy this guy believes he can just do anything in the world now he didn't say that he said if you are a believer you don't do them things right you need any help i'll explain it to you an unbeliever see the way god created things was beautiful now you're gonna maybe argue this point but listen with eve created with the ability to even the reason was a beautiful thing okay the bible says come let us reason together there's nothing wrong the prophet said with your reasonings if it is placed correctly do you need them quotes is there anything wrong with sister gayle reasoning that brother dick is the prettiest guy in the world he says that he is found you see church that's where we left and the things that we should have hold held on to it when he was made the way she was made and she took that and stayed there brother randall said you sisters are made with a virtue that you must not destroy there wasn't anything wrong with eve walking in the garden beside of adam and looking up there you know and said adam adam i love you you're my husband you're my head because i don't guess all you women tell you about your husband that you love them now do you do you ever tell us i love you you ever mean it you see church if a man and his wife is the type of christ in the church why can't the man and the wife be a wonderful pair of people put together that if you listen to what we were bringing this morning and thought about it that god hath joined together and let not man put us under if god joins you together as husband and wife you're one if man joins you you're not one you never will be until you both get born again that's why you're commanded not to marry an unbeliever right you're not supposed to marry an unbeliever he's supposed to marry a christian now to think about it i'll lay this part down and pick it up wednesday but brother dale you said this morning you gave some quotes from brother branham that eve committed adultery i don't believe that i believe she committed fornication because they've never been together we'll get to it wednesday right worth it joseph you're not to take unto thee mary thy girlfriend because she's committed fornication now that wasn't what it said you're not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is on the holy ghost amen he said well brother dale i've heard a lot and i'm putting this on here for some reason maybe it's out there i brought this and i wasn't going to read the quote put it back put it up put it and put it back but i just want to read something that people use and then look what you do with it go ahead with number 10 brother let's finish this up for some reason i keep coming back to it so i'm gonna put it on here maybe somebody here maybe somebody out in the world listening see a lot of people think that and it's true that fornication is before marriage and adultery is after marriage and that's exactly right all right but you've got to get it in the correct order brother bill what is the difference between four and this is uh paragraph 185 of questions and answers in 1959's 6 28 the evening service brother bill what is the difference between fornication adultery matthew 19 9 jesus said in matthew 19 9 whosoever puts away his wife and marries another except it be for the cause of fornication committed adultery the difference between fornication and adultery the word could be applied either way now listen to it but to make it clear what he was talking about talking of there that a woman that's unmarried cannot commit adultery that's right well brett ryan said he committed adultery so she was married we'll get to this wednesday because she has no husband to commit adultery against what is if a woman does something wrong before they man it's unclean it's for her that's unclean is that fornication a woman is not married can't commit adultery right but we'll get into it if you just engaged you're married all right but listen she has to confess that to her husband before they're married if she did that if not and her husband finds it out later he has a right to put her away because she took a false foul eve was married to adam okay fornication is what a girl when she lives unclean that's fornication because she has no husband but when she's when she's married and then when she lives like that she's committed adultery against her husband all right he said it can be used either way the bible speaks of the old mother in revelation the catholic church and the things the harlots as being fornicators when it says they commit adultery with them we're going to get down into a good bit but the main thing i want you to think about eve was married that's why it's adultery amen fornication is unclean living but it can be applied either way because adultery is what unclean living right see so the prophet's right when he said he'd be applied either way but you see eve committed adultery against her husband she disbelieved god's word and she took an act with the wrong person think on these things brother dale i've i've done this i've done that i've been wrong there's problems all right god can take care of a lot of problems if we let him but if we keep our own ideas and say bless god ain't nobody going to tell me i know what the prophet said hands up cross yourself why wouldn't you want to be free brother dale if i tell my husband he'll leave me you want me to get into that with the prophet he said you've already left god said he's left you as a sinner i said i wouldn't fool with a married woman it was just a it was a forbidden log to me i don't see why all boys and things went that way but i would not marry my wife until i told her my life she'll tell you that for why what reason i didn't know anything about the bible the message for some reason i would not marry her until i explained my life if it wasn't for just one reason i knew my family one day my brothers especially would come up and say sam i ain't the girl you used to be dating over there and i knew i'd have to explain it then it's always the best to get it out of the way tell her she could marry me if she wanted to then it wouldn't be none she could bring up later she always tell me i said honey the only problem you got is you're just too straight honest to tell everything why not why not why not be honest and straight that's right that's right amen why not just be what we are and be christians solve a lot of problems they always say you want to do a wedding or anything remember the prophets are quoting where it says in the wedding vows you know see if any man have any reason it is too we should not be joined together let him speak now forever i hold her peace i had to use that one time because the brother came to me and he said brother dale so-and-so and so and so about a wedding i said did you know that before the wedding he said yes i said you shut up and don't you ever say anything to anybody because you were the one that was supposed to told me the blood's on you the bible says let him forever hold his peace and i meant it i said don't you ever say anything to anybody about that see this thing is not a play purdy if we'd have been serious about it down to our lives we wouldn't have so much in problems in our human lives but we tried to get around you know but maybe god didn't see that come on brothers what is the fall sin not drinking gambling smoking running around that's not sin that's attributes of unbelief you do that because you're an unbeliever if you believed you wouldn't do it well i've done it brother dale did you ask god to forgive you come on unbelief the only sin that there is he said well should we pray for so-and-so the bible says to pray for everybody except the ones that have been committed to the devil you don't pray for them anymore as specific about it but until then you pray why because what brought you out of where you are i never did do them things well then you ought to be able to sympathize with other people that did see then eve wasn't created wrong she was created perfect then by her reasoning she accepted satan's life and his lie was that she was there for that purpose that was the truth but it was the wrong way in the wrong person very easy to express when you know the truth and what i love it says you shall know the truth and the truth will set you free understand the only way we can know is true why wouldn't anybody want to know the truth i told one brother about a certain thing in the church one time i said if anybody in the world needs marriage and divorce priests here right here you realize why i preach it you realize that the fact that if i don't tell you the truth your blood is on me and you realize then that if i don't tell you the truth you can't get straight amen right and if you can't get straight me and you're both in trouble right see then i want to tell the truth because i'm as honest as i can be i don't believe anybody is going to be there at the change in the moment the twinkling of an eye i did not say nothing about the rapture the people that died down through there not knowing the truth will come forth as beautiful and perfect as we are right but when you get down to that chain that moment the twinkle of an eye you've got a different situation to stand on if you can't find a way to be free then i'm going by the grave if i can't find it that's as honest as i've ever been with anybody to try to tell you but we need to be free that's right to find out why we've done it it's one thing and find out it's still here still motivating us but the truth is that it's free oh my god number six in the red book number 60 in the red book anybody have a need anybody have a name i'm trying to get right here to have to wait dark divorce a revelation from marriage and divorce will never cross any other scripture right that's why did i stand and believe it the new birth the new birth sets us free marriage and divorce is a greater higher order invisible union the higher order than your birth gotta be dead anybody have a need blood pressure 180 something over 117 or something like that last night as i i believing that god can heal i believe he can take it away don't you don't you believe it i believe it but i want what she says she said i want to be right all right i believe that's what's going to take us to the chains don't you being right and believe it father just reach down and touch our sister about this whole blood pressure problem let it be taken away from her we know you did in mine lord years ago we believe you same god had touched me the same wanted to touch our sister to set her free and we believed it and her desire in her heart is to be right with you and move on with you but we believe you father and we thank you in jesus name anybody else what about it you're dismissed lord be with everybody on the way home and give a safe journey in jesus name let's go you
