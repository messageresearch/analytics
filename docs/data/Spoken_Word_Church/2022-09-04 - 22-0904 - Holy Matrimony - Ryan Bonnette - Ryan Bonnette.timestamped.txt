[0:13] all right i'm going to teach a little
[0:14] lesson this morning about holy matrimony
[0:16] and i'm going to open
[0:18] with a word of prayer heavenly father we
[0:20] thank you for letting us get together
[0:21] today in your name and pray
[0:23] you'll just help us with teaching this
[0:24] lesson let it be a blessing to your
[0:26] people helper bob once again ministering
[0:28] in tennessee brother wade here and all
[0:30] of us teaching sunday school
[0:32] may everything be done for your glory
[0:33] and honor and uh once again thank you
[0:35] for touching all the sick and needy and
[0:38] give us understanding of your word i
[0:39] pray as we study this morning jesus name
[0:41] amen
[0:45] uh okay so this came on me really strong
[0:48] the other day when i was driving the
[0:49] chicken truck and i've thought of this
[0:50] for years this is nothing new but i
[0:53] really don't know why i haven't taught
[0:54] it before
[0:55] but uh the other night i was driving and
[0:57] i thought my wife some of these days i
[0:58] need to teach about this holy matrimony
[1:00] this uh certain idea about holy
[1:02] matrimony
[1:04] and i thought as strong as this
[1:05] anointing is i just seemed like i just
[1:07] got a teacher this sunday and then it
[1:08] was the next day brother bob said i need
[1:10] to teach sunday school sunday so i was
[1:12] like all right lord that makes sense
[1:14] because it came on me really strong
[1:16] thursday night so
[1:18] uh
[1:19] and then at the end if there's time i'm
[1:20] gonna try to show a little testimony
[1:22] video not really relevant to the lesson
[1:24] at all so the idea of um marriage that
[1:29] most people have in mind it seems like
[1:30] to me i'm talking about people in
[1:32] christianity as a whole not just in the
[1:34] message per se
[1:35] is that to put god in marriage you start
[1:38] off the marriage on the right foot so to
[1:40] speak you come to the altar get married
[1:42] by a preacher in a church and that's
[1:44] kind of your way of committing
[1:45] yourselves to god and saying lord we
[1:47] want you to bless our union we want you
[1:49] in our marriage and that's good and
[1:50] that's how it should start
[1:52] but the life after that is what's really
[1:54] important
[1:55] it's kind of like
[1:56] salvation when you come to the altar you
[1:58] confess your sins you say lord i want
[2:00] you in my life but then if you go out
[2:02] don't go to church don't read the bible
[2:04] after that
[2:05] you're really telling god i didn't
[2:07] really mean what i said you know you
[2:08] made the confession you invited into
[2:10] your heart but then you didn't live the
[2:11] life afterward just like with marriage
[2:13] if you come to the altar say lord we
[2:15] want you in our union we want you to
[2:16] bless our marriage but we're not going
[2:18] to read the bible together we're not
[2:19] going to pray together we might go to
[2:20] church together to do a few things but
[2:22] we're just not going to have any
[2:23] communion with you in our marriage and
[2:25] that's telling the lord the opposite of
[2:27] really what you want you want him in
[2:29] your marriage every day that's what
[2:30] makes it a holy matrimony that's the
[2:33] reason it's called
[2:34] holy so
[2:37] basically what you've done at the start
[2:38] of marriage is you've planted the seed a
[2:40] love seed you started this
[2:42] little form of love we can maybe call it
[2:43] puppy love i don't mean to belittle it
[2:45] because it's really strong when it
[2:47] starts but it can grow from there can go
[2:50] about two different directions it can
[2:51] either
[2:52] start an upward trajectory and grow and
[2:54] become stronger if you nurture it with
[2:56] the word of god
[2:57] or if you don't it can start to diminish
[3:00] and start to disintegrate and over the
[3:01] years
[3:02] in just a few years time you're about
[3:04] ready for divorce you know ready just
[3:05] all the time bickering and fighting
[3:07] and it can become a terrible thing after
[3:09] just a few years
[3:11] if you don't do what i'm talking about
[3:14] and this is such a simple thing that i
[3:15] think a lot of people overlook it
[3:17] it's so simple it's just as simple as
[3:19] reading your bible and praying every day
[3:21] in your own walk with the lord is what
[3:22] makes you grow closer to god but then
[3:24] people don't do it sometimes
[3:28] so holy matrimony is a divinely blessed
[3:31] lifelong union between a man and a woman
[3:34] and the holy part that part means
[3:36] dedicated or consecrated to god it means
[3:39] sacred
[3:41] so what am i talking about
[3:43] if you don't even read the bible
[3:44] together at least talk about the lord at
[3:46] least
[3:48] you know
[3:49] go to church together listen to sermons
[3:51] together and daily be communing with
[3:53] christ in your marriage in some way
[3:56] okay that's that's the focus here me and
[3:58] gabby read the bible together every day
[3:59] we consider it critical but
[4:02] uh even if you don't do that at least
[4:04] talk about the lord together at least
[4:05] say you know
[4:07] spouse i've been thinking about this
[4:08] about the lord today and and that starts
[4:10] a conversation that can go on for hours
[4:12] if you just start that just get it kind
[4:14] of triggered that little meditative
[4:16] state between you and your spouse
[4:18] and that is so key for god to bless your
[4:20] marriage and be in that union
[4:23] and one example i want to give right up
[4:25] front i've thought about them i've
[4:26] watched them for years his brother and
[4:27] sister dale
[4:28] even since before they heard the message
[4:30] they were going to church every service
[4:32] there was never a question
[4:34] as to whether they're going to church
[4:35] when they were in the baptist church
[4:37] never a question about it they always
[4:38] went to church they come into the
[4:39] message you say well he's the preacher
[4:41] he's got to be here even if he wasn't
[4:43] i'm sure they'd have been at church
[4:45] their whole marriage of 63 or 64 years
[4:48] they put christ in their marriage
[4:49] they've had a christ-centered marriage
[4:51] the entire time
[4:52] and talking about the lord together
[4:54] walking together in communion with
[4:56] christ and look what it's produced today
[4:58] they're still sweethearts today they're
[4:59] still in love like they were even more
[5:01] than than when they got married so it's
[5:03] caused that love to grow and manifest
[5:05] and they bear the fruit of it and i've
[5:07] watched their life for years and i've
[5:08] said god i want that in my marriage
[5:11] that's what i've been watching for all
[5:12] these years
[5:14] and and it'll just keep on getting
[5:16] better as the days go by because they're
[5:18] doing the right thing
[5:20] so i want to go back to the first
[5:22] marriage genesis 2
[5:24] and the lord god said it is not good
[5:25] that the man should be alone i will make
[5:27] him and help me for him and adam gave
[5:29] names to all cattle and the fowl of the
[5:31] air and every beast of the field and
[5:33] adam
[5:34] for adam that was not found and helped
[5:35] meet for him
[5:39] and the lord god caused a deep sleep to
[5:41] fall upon adam and he slept and took one
[5:43] of his ribs and closed the flesh instead
[5:45] the roof and the rib which the lord god
[5:46] had taken from man made he a woman and
[5:49] brought her unto him and adam said this
[5:50] is now bone in my bone flesh from my
[5:52] flesh he should be called won't be
[5:53] called woman because she was taken out
[5:55] of man
[5:56] therefore shall a man leave his father
[5:57] and mother shall cleave unto his wife
[5:59] and they shall be one flesh so this
[6:01] whole idea
[6:03] marriage came out of the mind of god
[6:05] this is his product okay he's the
[6:08] inventor the author of marriage he's the
[6:10] author of love he is love so if we're
[6:12] talking about love and marriage and how
[6:14] should we structure it we should look
[6:15] back to that original type and look at
[6:18] how god formed it in the beginning and
[6:19] say let's do that
[6:21] and quite simply the first marriage had
[6:24] the lord in it i'll show you here in a
[6:25] minute
[6:26] purposes of marriage these are just a
[6:27] few things i named uh one that types
[6:30] christ in the church you know how do we
[6:32] know god is a savior because we were
[6:34] lost and we needed salvation we know him
[6:36] as a healer because we were sick and
[6:38] needed healing
[6:40] likewise we see him how he deals with
[6:43] his
[6:43] his us his bride because we are husband
[6:46] and wife in a marriage we can really see
[6:48] that firsthand this love i have for
[6:50] gabby keeps growing such that i don't
[6:53] know how to express it i'm always
[6:54] writing her love letters and sharing
[6:56] love songs with her and talking to her
[6:58] and sending her text message at random
[7:00] just tell her how much i love her
[7:01] because i can't figure out how to
[7:02] express it sometimes it's so strong and
[7:05] that's then i think lord that must be
[7:06] how you feel towards your bride
[7:08] number two it teaches us
[7:10] to love it's a lifelong love lesson
[7:12] you're never done learning love learning
[7:15] what it means to be selfless and not
[7:17] think about your own self and everything
[7:19] about love it's it's just constantly
[7:21] every day you're learning more about
[7:22] love as you experience it in marriage
[7:25] it glorifies god through enhanced
[7:27] spiritual growth
[7:28] i mean by enhanced i mean in light it
[7:30] accelerates your spiritual growth if
[7:32] it's done this way it should accelerate
[7:35] you sh i should be helping gabby grow
[7:36] closer to the lord and she is i can
[7:38] testify to the fact that she has helped
[7:40] me grow closer lord in our marriage by
[7:42] us
[7:42] uh having this communion with christ
[7:45] if i don't think to mention it you know
[7:47] he said where two or three are gathered
[7:49] i'll be in their midst
[7:50] two makes a marriage
[7:52] and if you invite him in there every day
[7:54] he'll be in your marriage
[7:56] genesis 3
[7:57] this is right after the fall this is the
[7:58] only place i can think of in the bible
[8:00] it's kind of hard to find anywhere in
[8:02] the message
[8:03] or in the bible that i can see where
[8:05] it's plainly spelled out to do this
[8:07] you'll be surprised
[8:09] where i got this idea from i don't think
[8:11] it's actually written down i'll just go
[8:12] and tell y'all this idea came to me in
[8:14] 1999 in the baptist church
[8:17] this was a youth pastor my youth pastor
[8:20] in the baptist church i was 15 years old
[8:22] he told us a group of teenagers he said
[8:24] someday you all get married
[8:26] if you get married he'll say this is how
[8:28] he said this is how you should structure
[8:30] your marriage he's the one that told me
[8:32] this
[8:33] i don't know why it seems to be so hard
[8:34] to to find exactly a place in the
[8:36] message or bible where i can support
[8:38] this but right after the fall it did
[8:40] show that the lord was evidently coming
[8:43] down in the cold of the evening walking
[8:44] with them
[8:46] because it says they heard the voice of
[8:48] the lord walking in the garden in the
[8:49] cool of the day and adam and his wife
[8:50] hear themselves from the presence of the
[8:51] lord amongst the trees of the garden and
[8:53] the lord god called unto adam and said
[8:54] unto him where art thou so if he came
[8:57] down after the fall i can only infer
[8:59] maybe possibly most likely he was
[9:01] communing with them before the fall
[9:02] right walking with them in the garden
[9:04] daily in the cool of the day and
[9:07] doing what he would do what he did 2000
[9:09] years ago with his disciples you know
[9:10] talking about himself using maybe
[9:12] parables and examples
[9:14] to kind of unfold and reveal himself to
[9:16] them so god wants to be in our
[9:20] marriage it's plainly to me this is just
[9:23] plain is this day
[9:24] fellowship
[9:26] brother barron said now
[9:28] man was born to our fellowship man
[9:29] beginning back in the garden of eden he
[9:30] had wonderful fellowship god come down
[9:33] and fellowship with this company men and
[9:35] every evening
[9:37] in the cool of the evening god will come
[9:38] down under the great palm trees perhaps
[9:41] this sacred lightest was shining down on
[9:43] adam and eve and that great cathedral in
[9:45] the open fellowship with god had nothing
[9:47] to worry about as long as they were
[9:49] fellowshipping
[9:53] all right so true headship i wrote there
[9:54] equals fellowship and unity um so it's
[9:58] important to keep the headship in order
[10:00] so it's christ
[10:01] i'll just read it but i would have you
[10:03] know as paul saying i would have you
[10:05] know that the head of every man is
[10:07] christ and the head of the woman is the
[10:09] man and the head of christ is god so if
[10:12] we keep that in order and um you know
[10:15] there's everything that the lord reveals
[10:17] to me i immediately go to gabby and
[10:19] share with her you know she's the first
[10:20] one i want to talk to when maybe when
[10:22] i'm riding around the chicken truck at
[10:23] night and thinking meditating on the
[10:25] word the lord showed me something as
[10:26] soon as she gets up the next day she
[10:28] called me i started telling her about it
[10:29] you know it's important to keep these
[10:31] things in order and also she is
[10:34] the kind of like the pastor of our
[10:35] little flock you know our little kids
[10:37] because i can take something maybe
[10:38] that's preached here and break it down
[10:40] for gabby but she can break it down
[10:41] further to the kids
[10:43] and so then we have you know everything
[10:44] in order to where god can just reveal on
[10:47] each of our level
[10:49] this is the simple
[10:51] diagram that was given me in the baptist
[10:53] church 22
[10:55] 22 years ago i was 15 years old
[10:57] it's a simple triangle or a pyramid you
[10:59] could say it shows husband on the left
[11:02] god on the top and wife on the right
[11:05] this is not some kind of perversion okay
[11:07] i'm not mean any anything uh perverted
[11:10] or corrupt here by saying this um
[11:12] you know it's just keep our minds pure
[11:15] all i'm simply saying is that god is in
[11:17] the marriage in that headship order i'm
[11:19] saying
[11:20] these arrows show relationships
[11:23] so
[11:24] i'll break them down one at a time
[11:27] this is what was given to me
[11:28] by that minister
[11:30] uh
[11:31] so the husband has to have his own walk
[11:33] with the lord okay
[11:35] that is crucial for this to work
[11:38] and bringing christ in marriage does not
[11:40] negate your individual walk with the
[11:42] lord is no substitute he the husband has
[11:44] to have his own walk with the lord so i
[11:46] read the bible and pray every single day
[11:49] no matter what listen to sermons every
[11:52] day
[11:52] likewise the wife
[11:54] has to have her walk with the lord for
[11:56] this thing to work
[11:58] she has to read her bible and pray and
[11:59] listen to sermons every day and commune
[12:01] with christ in her own private time now
[12:03] this is a salvation issue
[12:05] this is us working out our salvation
[12:07] individually because there's no
[12:08] collective salvation it's not like me
[12:10] and gabby are saved because we read the
[12:11] bomb pray together she has to work out
[12:13] her own salvation and i have to work out
[12:14] mine that's separate now and then of
[12:17] course husband and wife have a
[12:18] relationship together that's marriage
[12:20] but the middle part is what i think a
[12:22] lot of people miss
[12:23] the daily communing together
[12:24] collectively with christ that's what i'm
[12:27] talking about
[12:28] fellowship communion with christ
[12:32] all right
[12:34] so satan despises unity oneness
[12:37] fellowship love marriage etc everything
[12:40] god stands for satan despises and he is
[12:43] attacking marriage vehemently he is
[12:46] there marriage is almost unheard of
[12:48] anymore in the world people just shack
[12:49] up they don't get married you know they
[12:51] just check up together and whatever but
[12:52] i'm talking about in christianity even
[12:54] where marriage should be maybe i
[12:56] wouldn't say easy but it should be able
[12:58] to work you know two married people who
[13:00] are both christians should be able to
[13:01] work out their little differences and
[13:03] come together in unity in christ and
[13:06] doing this doesn't take away the
[13:07] problems it just gives you the ability
[13:09] to work them out so much easier so much
[13:11] better than if you try to just say well
[13:14] i'm gonna serve the lord over here you
[13:15] go over there and you serve them
[13:16] yourself and we'll just come together
[13:18] and eat supper you know i mean you got
[13:20] to have somewhere where you meet in the
[13:21] middle and talk about the lord
[13:23] he is adamantly satan is adamantly
[13:25] attacking these things causing strife
[13:27] division divorce etc and hatred
[13:30] it's quite an attack and i know i know
[13:32] some things you know it's just like i
[13:34] hear problems in people's marriages and
[13:35] i hate it i despise divorce i despise it
[13:38] with a passion i don't think it should
[13:40] ever happen it really shouldn't
[13:41] especially in christian marriage it
[13:42] should not happen
[13:44] uh root cause and marital problems
[13:47] if you dig down to the very bottom of it
[13:49] you could say oh well he said she said
[13:50] that he did this he did that all kind of
[13:52] little bickering and fighting
[13:54] at the very root of it it's our adamic
[13:56] nature and we all have that we're all
[13:57] born with that that's the point of
[13:59] needing the new birth so our damic
[14:01] nature everything that the fall produced
[14:04] enmity
[14:05] strife division sedition all kind of
[14:08] little jealous feelings that rise up
[14:10] the remedy for marital problems is the
[14:13] new birth daily communion with christ
[14:15] individually and collectively
[14:18] frankly i know it's kind of funny but if
[14:20] anybody comes to me saying i'm depressed
[14:21] what i do i say read the bible and pray
[14:23] every day
[14:24] it doesn't seem like it really directly
[14:26] addresses depression but it does it
[14:27] worked for me just do it every day and
[14:29] you won't see an effect maybe for years
[14:31] but keep doing it somebody said well i'm
[14:34] having lust problems i say read the ball
[14:36] and pray every day
[14:37] it'll work just keep doing it you're
[14:39] sowing down seeds you wait on god to
[14:41] quicken those seeds but you got to keep
[14:43] bringing the word of god in
[14:44] feeding on it constantly
[14:49] and then john 15 now ye are clean
[14:52] through the word which i have spoken
[14:54] unto you
[14:55] abide in me and i in you as the branch
[14:58] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[15:00] abide in the vine no more can ye
[15:03] except you abide in me so it's not just
[15:05] a one time we come to the altar we say
[15:07] lord come into our marriage we're
[15:08] getting married
[15:09] in a church by a preacher we want you in
[15:11] our marriage no it's an abiding in him
[15:15] and that process of the word cleansing
[15:17] us from all of our wrong things
[15:21] uh amos three can two walk together
[15:24] except they be agreed
[15:25] this is all about talk talking about
[15:27] agreement it's hard to walk together in
[15:29] life two people
[15:31] at in any case is hard okay but
[15:33] especially if they're in disagreement
[15:36] about what they believe and and what
[15:38] they see in the word but if you just
[15:39] keep reading the bible and praying even
[15:41] if there is a disagreement or
[15:42] misunderstanding or confusion or
[15:44] whatever any kind of dispute you just
[15:46] keep sowing these seeds keep sowing the
[15:47] word of god in your marriage and your
[15:49] lives individually and collectively and
[15:51] watch what happens
[15:52] you'll start to come together in the
[15:54] unity of faith it might take years but
[15:55] it'll happen
[15:57] matthew 18 again i say unto you that if
[16:00] two of you shall agree on earth as
[16:01] touching anything they shall ask it
[16:03] shall be done for them of my father
[16:04] which is in heaven
[16:08] uh and then matthew 6 33 but seek you
[16:11] first the kingdom of god and his
[16:12] righteousness and all these things
[16:13] should be added unto you
[16:16] um i want to give y'all just in with
[16:18] just a little bit of hope about
[16:19] something
[16:20] um you know the hollywood kind of paints
[16:22] this picture in the movies you know of a
[16:25] man and woman true love at first sight
[16:27] they fall in love they get married and
[16:28] they live happily ever after and growing
[16:30] up i used to wonder is that real does
[16:32] that really exist
[16:33] and you know many people i think come to
[16:36] marriage and and and with that high hope
[16:38] that they're going to have that happen
[16:39] they're just magically going to write
[16:40] off in the sunset and live happily ever
[16:42] after and then the bickering and the
[16:43] fighting and all these things money
[16:45] problems money fights and problems about
[16:47] other things in marriage come up and
[16:49] they're like well i guess that's not
[16:50] real it's just a picture i want to tell
[16:52] you it is real
[16:54] true love does happen and it's a real
[16:56] thing happily ever ever after it does
[16:58] happen this is a passion of mine because
[17:00] i thought for all these years lord i am
[17:02] experiencing this it's a real thing i
[17:04] love gabby so much and that i can't even
[17:07] express it to her and lord i wish that
[17:10] that could be in everybody's marriage i
[17:12] wish there's some way i can convey that
[17:14] to help everybody have that i want it so
[17:16] bad for people
[17:17] and like i said i don't know why i
[17:18] haven't shared it in a testimony in a
[17:20] class before i did give it out to the
[17:22] young people maybe a year or two ago i
[17:24] wrote it down like a testimony mailed it
[17:26] out to the young people that might be
[17:28] getting married to make sure and do this
[17:29] put god in marriage
[17:31] but it is such a key such a crucial
[17:34] thing to do and it really works
[17:36] i ended a little bit faster than i
[17:37] thought but um i have this testimony
[17:39] video a lot of you saw it on whatsapp
[17:42] but this is for those who didn't get to
[17:43] see it if brother anderson could play
[17:45] that at this time please
[18:16] [Music]
[18:28] every year around iva's birthday we
[18:30] testify to remind everybody about what
[18:32] the lord did for us her name abba means
[18:35] god is gracious
[18:37] and he's been so gracious to us to spare
[18:38] her life so many times around her birth
[18:40] and all throughout her life so far
[18:43] so we want to give testimony about that
[18:45] in the bible we find the lord likes us
[18:47] to remember the things he's done for us
[18:49] because
[18:50] we tend to forget god and his blessings
[18:53] and benefits and everything he's done
[18:54] for us in the past but going back and
[18:57] rehearsing the things that he's done for
[18:59] us causes us to
[19:01] uh
[19:01] realize how much god is with us and how
[19:04] real he is how much how real his
[19:06] presence is among us so when iva was
[19:09] born uh in 2014 july 2nd 2014 right
[19:13] after her birth she had complications uh
[19:16] her lungs were underdeveloped she was a
[19:18] big premature baby and that made it even
[19:20] harder because her lungs were not
[19:22] getting oxygen to her body and she had
[19:24] this seven and a half pound
[19:27] body a lot of body mass and no oxygen
[19:30] and so um after a few days she was on
[19:32] her deathbed right then we had received
[19:34] two of three witnesses back to back
[19:37] telling us the same thing don't fear
[19:38] don't worry even if iva dies just don't
[19:41] worry don't fear no matter what and
[19:44] right after that dr heidi carping came
[19:46] in the room and sat down and said first
[19:48] she introduced herself she said i'm
[19:51] [Music]
[19:56] your baby's dying
[19:57] yeah real blunt real straight forward
[20:02] [Music]
[20:21] so now by that time i had received
[20:23] three life witnesses three death
[20:24] witnesses three times the lord had told
[20:27] me through three different things
[20:29] that
[20:30] don't fear
[20:32] and three times i've been told by three
[20:34] different medical professionals that
[20:35] your baby's dying
[20:37] so now i have to choose
[20:39] faith or fear
[20:41] believe
[20:42] or doubt
[20:43] and we chose to believe no matter what
[20:49] see don't reason believe
[20:52] no matter what the circumstances don't
[20:54] pay no attention to circumstances
[20:56] believe
[20:59] [Music]
[21:03] faith
[21:04] in the old testament
[21:06] mastered
[21:08] the lines
[21:10] and shut their mouth
[21:11] shut them up
[21:13] how many lies do you want shut up in
[21:15] your life
[21:17] listen we're in a lion's den every day
[21:19] when we walk out in that world
[21:21] there's something or somebody wanting to
[21:23] eat us up all the time
[21:26] but when faith masters that circumstance
[21:28] see
[21:29] it masters all
[21:32] all
[21:33] circumstances
[21:36] you know why
[21:37] because god said so
[21:39] brother william bull of uncreates one
[21:41] sermon that morning i had one service
[21:43] and then the left went back down to
[21:45] atlanta
[21:46] and turned out she was getting better on
[21:48] her own
[21:49] without any procedure without any
[21:51] additional medicines
[21:54] nothing changed
[21:56] procedure-wise
[21:57] medicine
[21:59] equipment all that nothing changed
[22:01] and then so from that point on she was
[22:03] improving and finally about a month old
[22:05] she came home from the hospital a
[22:06] healthy baby she turned four
[22:09] found her
[22:10] sitting on the couch indian style but
[22:13] she had fallen forward
[22:16] and i thought it was cute so i snapped a
[22:17] picture you can see that her eyes are
[22:20] still
[22:20] open
[22:21] so i investigated a little bit and find
[22:23] that she is unresponsive she's staring
[22:27] and right away i kind of knew it was a
[22:29] seizure so i get her up
[22:31] put her
[22:32] in the floor and that's when she starts
[22:35] not fully convulsing but it's
[22:39] uh twitching
[22:39] jerking or spasming or whatever you want
[22:42] to call it but it was a full-blown
[22:43] seizure by that point take her to the
[22:44] hospital and by that time it's been over
[22:47] an hour well over and out just like
[22:50] everybody was there hands on deck
[22:52] everybody last option was to sedate her
[22:57] and put her like an
[22:58] on life support medical induced coma to
[23:00] get it to stop lana and they called in
[23:02] the helicopter
[23:04] to send her off and the obvious concern
[23:07] was that she was going to have brain
[23:08] damage yeah because
[23:10] her lack of oxygen in over an hour they
[23:13] did their scans when she first and was
[23:15] admitted and
[23:17] they said it looked normal
[23:20] and she's perfectly fine i woke her up
[23:22] pulled her out of all that medical
[23:24] induced and first thing out of her mouth
[23:26] is
[23:26] where's my clothes
[23:29] and then she still hadn't no
[23:32] didn't realize that there was
[23:34] time that had
[23:36] progressed
[23:38] her next thing that she asked is are we
[23:39] still going shopping yeah
[23:42] so she was perfectly normal and picked
[23:44] up right where she left off
[23:46] right before her eighth birthday she had
[23:48] an eeg
[23:50] which is just a study overnight study
[23:53] for her seizures
[23:54] and she didn't have a single one
[23:57] and so they took her off all medication
[23:59] and she's been okay
[24:00] so this is our little healthy
[24:02] eight-year-old iva say hello hi
[24:05] so did jesus make you better when you're
[24:07] a baby yeah
