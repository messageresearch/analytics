[3:31] is good to us and it is a real privilege
[3:33] to be here with you I I have grown in a
[3:37] short time to realize that I have known
[3:40] you all since before the foundation of
[3:42] the world you know you don't always you
[3:47] have friends then you have friends and
[3:49] while we'll fellowship and shake hands
[3:52] and hug anybody and everybody you don't
[3:55] always have a real close rapport with
[3:57] everybody you do that with but I I feel
[3:59] comfortable I know it's a Wednesday
[4:02] nights and and and I'll just take a
[4:04] little bit and the peace and and I don't
[4:08] know what brother Wade is and brother
[4:11] Samuel have been preaching on but I know
[4:12] it's about the seals and that's probably
[4:16] my favorite subject so I'll just bring
[4:19] something to help shade in and maybe an
[4:21] area here there and I'm not going to say
[4:24] anything I'm sure you haven't already
[4:26] heard god bless you now you realize that
[4:30] I remembered my coat my tie and my own
[4:35] masculine glasses thank you but thanks
[4:40] to the sister who loaned me your glasses
[4:41] when I needed them
[4:43] amen amen if you would take your Bibles
[4:46] while you're standing and turn to st.
[4:48] John chapter 12 of course I do bring
[4:51] greetings from the
[4:52] in Akal in cottonwood arizona and the
[4:54] flock there and I encourage them anytime
[4:58] they come this way to stop in and see
[5:01] you all amen
[5:02] and we pray that that'll happen so I'm
[5:06] gonna just speak on something hey you
[5:08] asked me for a title like the man that
[5:11] does the PA and the audio/visual in our
[5:14] church has to check track me down in the
[5:16] parking lot after church and say what do
[5:19] I call it so I'm not I'm kind of I guess
[5:22] on the other side okay but I gave him a
[5:26] couple scriptures I'm gonna read a few
[5:28] quotes but I'll let you relax st. John
[5:29] 12 everybody knows this scriptures verse
[5:32] 27 all right how are you with me
[5:37] well I better find it then now is my
[5:40] soul troubled and what shall I say
[5:42] father save me from this hour but for
[5:48] this cause came I unto this hour
[5:53] father glorify thy name then came there
[5:57] a voice from heaven saying I have both
[6:01] glorified it and will glorify it again
[6:04] the people therefore that stood by and
[6:08] heard it said that it thundered others
[6:12] said an angel spake to him jesus
[6:16] answered and said this voice came not
[6:19] because of me but for your sakes now is
[6:24] the judgment of this world now shall the
[6:26] Prince of this world be cast out and I
[6:29] if I be lifted up from the earth will
[6:32] draw all men unto me let's pray father
[6:36] Lord we realize that these scriptures
[6:39] have been read for near 2,000 years Lord
[6:42] but it's finally come to the place
[6:44] father in time and history that you've
[6:47] allotted for there to be a group of
[6:49] people who can come to the full
[6:51] understanding of these things now we
[6:53] realize Father that we couldn't do this
[6:56] without you sending a prophet and
[6:58] revealing and working through him Lord
[7:01] and speaking and leaving us references
[7:04] we could draw from that counting on you
[7:08] tonight Lord can't be us it must be you
[7:12] always for your honor and your glory in
[7:15] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[7:18] god bless you may be seated now one of
[7:23] my difficulties is mmm besides getting
[7:26] started is finding a place to stop and
[7:36] Annie know we're just gonna be here for
[7:38] 30 45 minutes you know and it's so it's
[7:42] so different this is an eternal word now
[7:45] my wife would be back there right now
[7:46] saying we'll just get into it but I I'm
[7:51] just the type of guy that wants to make
[7:54] sure you understand me
[7:55] I really do I don't I don't consider
[7:59] myself to be odd although I have been
[8:01] called a round peg in a square hole now
[8:07] you realize I'm a carpenter and I know a
[8:09] little bit about geometry you cannot get
[8:13] a square peg in a round hole but you can
[8:18] get a round peg in a square hole leaves
[8:23] four pyramids one in each corner but I
[8:27] thought maybe asked me for a title I
[8:30] said what is the thunder now it's been
[8:33] preached on I I know that and I'm not
[8:36] here to like I say introduce anything
[8:38] wild and unusual but I will use the
[8:42] message of the are which I know you're
[8:43] familiar with and we'll just see now
[8:46] first of all if you could refer back to
[8:50] your scriptures in verse 28 there came
[8:57] there a voice from heaven then came
[8:59] there a voice from heaven saying I both
[9:01] glorified it and will glorify it again
[9:04] so now we do believe in a return sort of
[9:09] okay brother brother my cultic and i
[9:12] were really ribbing each other he says I
[9:14] believe in return brother a return
[9:16] ministry you better come back and I
[9:18] said I'll be back brother Mike don't you
[9:19] worry you you understand okay all right
[9:22] that kind of return ministry I don't
[9:26] believe brother branham I believe that
[9:27] his body has left us but the Spirit of
[9:30] Christ that used him he's still here the
[9:33] pillar of fire that you see in the
[9:35] photograph taking it Sam Houston
[9:37] Coliseum if you don't believe it's still
[9:39] here tonight we got trouble if you don't
[9:42] believe that a piece of that pillar of
[9:45] fire that we see in the photograph that
[9:47] Moses met on the mountain is not
[9:50] dwelling in your heart we got a problem
[9:52] we're gonna have one right now it says
[9:57] in verse 29 the people therefore that
[10:00] stood by now look how close they were to
[10:03] Christ all right and heard it now what
[10:10] did they hear they heard a thunder they
[10:14] did not hear the voice of God in that
[10:18] forum they heard it in the form of a
[10:20] thunder so here's what brother Branham
[10:22] says you all know this in hearing
[10:25] recognizing and acting on the word first
[10:28] faith cometh by hearing hearing of the
[10:32] word of God I put down Romans 10:17 then
[10:35] the believer hears it now here's the
[10:38] believer these years it recognize it and
[10:41] acts on it but the carnal man will hear
[10:45] it the sound of it but never and then he
[10:51] pauses he says here means to understand
[10:55] it look at is looking at something but
[10:59] to see it is to understand it except a
[11:04] man be born again he cannot see or
[11:06] understand the kingdom now the reason I
[11:10] read that is obvious because those that
[11:12] stood by heard it but something happened
[11:17] to their hearing because here we
[11:20] understand they were in a coral state
[11:24] because the carnal man hears it but
[11:26] doesn't understand it the believer hears
[11:29] it understands it and
[11:31] that's on it all right so I'm here to
[11:36] act on it tonight I hope you're here
[11:38] with me to act on it all right
[11:40] now in the in the seals let's see right
[11:47] here page 124 first seal now I'm using
[11:51] the and I say this because I've went
[11:54] through five or six of the old
[11:55] publication the black cover whether it
[11:58] was a hard or a soft cover the red when
[12:00] I've saved that I've had for 30 38 years
[12:04] but now I've got the newest publication
[12:06] of the seal book the one with the oh I
[12:08] don't know what color the the cover is
[12:10] on but so I'm going to give you page
[12:12] numbers and references and they'll vary
[12:14] the words won't the page number in the
[12:17] paragraph may vary with the old
[12:19] publication I just want you to be aware
[12:21] of that on page 124 here of the new
[12:24] publication seal book brother branham
[12:26] reads John twelfth then he says then
[12:29] when the lamb took the book this is all
[12:34] important to me remember I I think the
[12:37] last time in the first of my serie rent
[12:39] you out of Revelation book of symbols
[12:41] it's all symbols look there's a
[12:45] prophetic class that word that it was
[12:48] sent to and they would see it or
[12:52] understand it they would hear it
[12:54] correctly all right you're with me took
[12:58] the book and broke that first seal City
[13:00] his brothers on top of it God spoke from
[13:02] his eternal throne to say what that seal
[13:05] was to be revealed but when it placed
[13:10] before John it was in a symbol when John
[13:14] saw it it was still a mystery and then
[13:18] he says why question it wasn't even
[13:22] revealed right then it cannot be
[13:26] revealed until what he said here at the
[13:30] end time but it come in a symbol so you
[13:34] realize what brother Branham is telling
[13:36] us believe you do that what was said
[13:38] back then could not be revealed until
[13:41] now all right
[13:44] now when the thundered he says remember
[13:47] a loud clapping noise of a thunder is
[13:51] look at the what he says now is it a
[13:54] voice of God in this book it says a
[13:59] voice of God and just reading it to you
[14:02] okay that's what the Bible says see a
[14:06] clap of thunder now they thought it was
[14:10] a thunder but it was God so so I'm gonna
[14:13] stop right there and say this now I've
[14:16] been around for almost forty years in in
[14:19] connection with the message right I got
[14:21] saved off the street you probably know
[14:23] that right into a message church didn't
[14:25] know God sent a prophet didn't know God
[14:27] had a message but I was by the grace of
[14:30] God able to come off the street right
[14:33] into the church doors of a message
[14:36] church I say that preaching the message
[14:39] you understand what I mean
[14:41] believing God's in a prophet so forth
[14:42] right so so I when I first come to the
[14:48] message and some of you have already
[14:50] passes I heard about well there's some
[14:52] men that call themselves the seven
[14:54] thunders you follow me all right sorry
[15:03] brother hey I fixed that thank you
[15:07] brother thank you now the reason why
[15:11] we're it a lot of people are I've been
[15:14] told well you overdressed brother when I
[15:17] play football
[15:18] you couldn't over dress when I race
[15:21] motocross you couldn't over dress yeah
[15:25] dad the uniform on that was appropriate
[15:27] for the moment so as much as I dislike
[15:31] wearing suits I wear them all right you
[15:35] with me all right now so so I want to
[15:38] give you how my thought process works
[15:40] don't worry I'm not bringing up the men
[15:42] of the past that thought they were the
[15:44] thunders but there were men who I never
[15:47] met who claimed from around the land of
[15:49] the world that they
[15:50] one of those thunders but I found out
[15:54] after the Lord opened his word to me
[15:56] that they're confused and the reason
[16:05] they're confused is not because they
[16:07] were bad people it's because if it comes
[16:10] in the form of a thunder it's
[16:12] misunderstood you see these people here
[16:17] in John 12 they had no clue they knew
[16:20] that it was God talking but they did not
[16:25] understand the voice do you know where
[16:29] they got the idea that God was talking
[16:31] to them because they got references back
[16:34] into the Old Testament to when God was
[16:37] going to meet the children of Israel on
[16:38] the mountain and it's sundered in it
[16:40] lightning and the trumpet sounded long
[16:43] and oh don't let God talk to us Moses
[16:47] would you do the job because they were
[16:49] afraid of God do you know why they were
[16:52] afraid of God in that form because he
[16:54] came to them by misunderstanding they
[16:58] did not understand God they did not know
[17:01] what God meant when he said something we
[17:04] still have people like that today and to
[17:06] them now these words are like thunder
[17:13] you follow me because brother Branham
[17:15] explains it right here he says when the
[17:19] thundered remember a loud clapping noise
[17:21] of a thunder is the voice of God I'll
[17:25] have to correct that in his book that's
[17:27] what the Bible says see a clap of
[17:29] thunder they thought it was a thunder
[17:31] but it was God he understood it that's
[17:36] the key phrase right there it was not a
[17:39] thunder to Jesus it was the voice of God
[17:42] he understood completely and clearly
[17:44] what was being said to him so it was not
[17:47] in the voice in the sound of a thunder
[17:49] it wasn't in the form of thunder you
[17:52] follow me but they are worded as a
[17:55] thunder and then some said will an angel
[17:59] speak to him
[18:01] boy we got that going on today everybody
[18:05] thinks that y'all just lays on one man
[18:08] when it's Sun God it's not on one man
[18:11] it's on that and if you or I understand
[18:16] what God is saying it's not a thunder
[18:19] it's the voice of God to us I could stop
[18:24] right there you just let that sink in
[18:31] because if you'll take what he said
[18:33] right here and you start meditating on
[18:38] all the things that look mysterious to
[18:43] you and of course we realize I took the
[18:46] subject on purpose the thunders are a
[18:48] mystery but they're not a mystery to
[18:52] everybody somebody's going to come to
[18:56] the understanding of what God is saying
[18:58] and it's not going to be the sound of a
[19:01] thunder because I can read to you our
[19:02] brother Branham said the real true
[19:04] church in the last days is going to
[19:07] understand those seven voices he says so
[19:16] it's not nearly as mysterious as people
[19:20] make it out to be it's really God
[19:23] revealed in simplicity but you see these
[19:26] things don't open up to the ministry and
[19:30] to the people until God wants it to
[19:33] there's got to be a people prepared
[19:35] there's got to be a selection of people
[19:39] there's got to be a group of elect that
[19:42] are willing to surrender themselves to
[19:45] the point where God can use them God can
[19:48] talk to them God can reveal thanks to
[19:50] them
[19:51] and they won't get high puffed up they
[19:55] they they they will stay humble just due
[19:58] to the fact that God showed you I mean
[20:00] this humbles me I've talked to men for
[20:03] 40 years and ministries of all kinds and
[20:06] then when you see a little
[20:07] like this you go home praise them no I
[20:10] mean thank you God thank you for
[20:14] revealing it to show up babe listen now
[20:18] such as would learn do you know why
[20:22] brother branham put that with that he
[20:25] hid it from the wise and prudent and it
[20:28] revealed it unto bates now you won't
[20:30] find in the scriptures such as we'll
[20:32] learn in that string sentence but what
[20:38] we do find is that in the day you and I
[20:40] live in do you know he was only talking
[20:42] to you and I because the day you and I
[20:44] live in is the day where everybody knows
[20:47] everything
[20:48] you can't teach anybody anything anymore
[20:51] because they're closed up they're closed
[20:53] off because it's Laodicea
[20:56] they don't have need of nothing brother
[20:59] I got the same book the same Bible the
[21:01] same quotes the same computer chip the
[21:03] same program you can't tell me nothing
[21:07] don't ever let me get that way I want to
[21:12] learn at the feet of the master and I
[21:17] happen to know his feet are made up of
[21:20] people like you and I and then cuz he
[21:25] has no feet but ours we're told I
[21:28] believe that he has no hands but ours I
[21:32] believe that so let me finish my thought
[21:39] they thought it was a thunder but it was
[21:42] God he understood it for he was revealed
[21:47] to him see it was a thunder but remember
[21:53] he was in position to have it be the
[21:57] voice of God to him I love this this is
[22:04] good for me see because I can take that
[22:06] little tiny concept that little nugget
[22:09] right there and then when you begin to
[22:11] move around through the message in the
[22:13] scriptures you go oh man and watch it
[22:17] now but you start to convey that to
[22:19] somebody who doesn't see what you see
[22:21] and it sounds like lightning just struck
[22:27] Oh see that's what this they jumping
[22:33] back you know man I can't handle that
[22:36] well you know it's like people who don't
[22:39] like it a little noisy in the church I'm
[22:41] not speaking about Pentecostal
[22:43] denomination I'm talking about life
[22:45] you see what I'm saying and some people
[22:47] just sit there and then sucking on a
[22:49] lemon you know well I I mean I have
[22:53] trouble identifying the life that's in
[22:55] them because man when the Word of God
[22:58] begins to come in and vibrate the
[23:00] strings in your soul it's like even if
[23:02] you don't jump up and shout you're
[23:04] feeling good on the inside you know like
[23:08] man that's talking to me you know and
[23:13] you might just throw your hand up every
[23:15] once in a while if you don't like the
[23:16] noise it's alright but then you wouldn't
[23:19] like the throne of God
[23:20] man I'll read to you in Revelations 5
[23:23] where the throne of God is lightnings
[23:25] and thunders and voice some people don't
[23:32] understand the throne of God thunder
[23:35] some people can't see into the throne of
[23:39] God lightning but then there are voices
[23:42] and those voices are talking to you and
[23:45] I it's the voice of God thundering out
[23:50] through the ages man I love that I love
[23:55] it though my heart is it talks to me it
[23:59] makes me feel humble God would look down
[24:04] upon my lowest state and begin to talk
[24:07] with me you with me I'm going to turn
[24:11] one corner and stop
[24:14] no no I've you know I told brother Wade
[24:17] I'm going to act like I'm at home
[24:19] and I like on Wednesday night I have I
[24:22] have a concept of time I've got ten
[24:25] grandchildren most of them go to school
[24:27] you know so it's I'm sensitive to that
[24:29] you've probably all worked today and if
[24:32] you didn't you're tired from not working
[24:35] have you found that out man I get cabin
[24:39] fever in a minute but the more I sit
[24:42] around the tireder I get the more I
[24:44] sleep the more I want to sleep so I pray
[24:48] Lord just give me three or four or five
[24:49] good hours and let me get out of that
[24:51] bed but like the Prophet said as you get
[24:54] it a little up there in years it's hard
[24:56] to swing one leg out of that bed after
[24:58] the other you know I know what he's
[25:02] talking about got arthritis and this and
[25:04] that and I'm not testifying about the
[25:06] devil I'm just saying we're beat up I'm
[25:08] just the kind of guy that's praying for
[25:10] people like you and me to get a new body
[25:12] because I need one I need one right now
[25:17] can't hardly see my hair's going bye-bye
[25:21] bye it's even worse now and I made the
[25:26] mistake of seeing a barber a barber
[25:30] Parris Island South Carolina you can
[25:34] tell he just cuts Marines all day long I
[25:38] lost about two pounds last week
[25:41] that's all right it'll grow back right
[25:44] Amen you love this this speaks to me I'm
[25:48] gonna read a little bit further here
[25:49] okay
[25:50] paragraph 148 here in this book and
[25:53] notice the first seal opened the first
[25:57] seal when it was opened in the symbol
[26:01] form it thundered now now you know why
[26:06] nobody understood it yet it was still in
[26:09] the form of a mystery it was in the form
[26:12] of symbols that God had not revealed to
[26:14] anybody he didn't even reveal him to
[26:16] join yet
[26:19] the reason I say yet is because we're
[26:23] taught by the Prophet that John here
[26:27] represented the entire body of Christ
[26:31] I don't have to read you that quote you
[26:32] can find yourself okay
[26:35] he says when it was open in the symbol
[26:37] form it thundered now what about here's
[26:39] what I want to get you tonight now what
[26:41] about when it's opened in its reality
[26:43] form okay it thundered as soon as the
[26:50] lamb struck back the seal and what did
[26:53] they reveal not all of itself first it's
[26:57] with God
[26:59] next it's in a symbol then it's revealed
[27:03] three things see it's coming forth from
[27:06] the throne first it can't be seen heard
[27:10] or nothing it's sealed up the Lambs
[27:13] blood paid the price it thundered when
[27:20] he spoke it out and when he did a white
[27:22] horse rider started out and we know
[27:23] still a symbol he said it would be known
[27:27] in the last day but it comes forth in a
[27:31] church symbol and then he says do you
[27:33] understand it church it comes forth in a
[27:37] symbol of a church that they know there
[27:40] is a seal but just what it is yet they
[27:44] don't know because it's a white horse
[27:46] writer now we've all gotten that far
[27:50] even when brother Branham was visited
[27:53] every morning by the angel of that
[27:56] church to reveal to him correctly what
[27:59] each seal was he gave us the definition
[28:04] of the white horse rider but there's
[28:06] still a lot of confusion there's still a
[28:10] lot of confusion because those are
[28:12] things that we can read those are things
[28:16] that can be defined by a dictionary
[28:21] those are things don't let it shock
[28:23] those are things that the devil can read
[28:26] he can read these books just like me and
[28:29] matter of fact he studies way more than
[28:32] all of us put together but the one thing
[28:35] he lacks is a relationship with God
[28:39] so that he can have the revelation of
[28:41] what's being said what's being written
[28:43] what's being preached you can see this
[28:51] is some of my favorite stuff paragraph
[28:55] 151 and only listen now and only it's to
[29:00] be revealed at the last day
[29:02] this is the key when this actual seal is
[29:09] broken broken to who not to Christ see
[29:15] because everybody wants to keep laying
[29:16] it back on the prophet I've already
[29:19] explained this to you folks I've been
[29:20] here at least twice there ain't nobody
[29:23] in here who holds the prophet of God
[29:26] that came in the 20th century in any
[29:29] higher regard than me I mean that but
[29:33] I've begun to see it's not all on the
[29:36] prophet and the reason it's not all on
[29:38] the prophet is because if you realize
[29:41] what God was trying to do before the
[29:44] foundation of the world he was called
[29:46] Elohim now if it was all gonna rest on
[29:51] one man then he could have remained out
[29:54] of him
[29:55] and carried out this plan but he did not
[29:59] want to remain self existent he wanted
[30:05] to exist with his attributes and
[30:08] therefore he was gonna have to rely
[30:10] listen now devil wherever you act he was
[30:13] gonna have to rely on the likes of
[30:15] people like you and me
[30:19] my wife was talking to me last night now
[30:22] and she said well what about this and
[30:24] what about that I said honey do you
[30:25] realize now I'm not I want you to
[30:28] understand before I close I'm not using
[30:30] this analogy in any way shape or form to
[30:33] demean what we believe but I'm gonna
[30:35] give it to you the way that I can
[30:37] explain it to myself so that I can see
[30:41] it this is not a chess game but to Satan
[30:46] it is it's a chess game to Satan and God
[30:50] doesn't have any problem with that and
[30:52] I've played chess for years don't play
[30:55] it anymore
[30:56] it bores me because the Word of God is
[31:00] preeminent in my life
[31:02] but I realized right away to be good at
[31:04] chess your pawns are your most important
[31:10] men on the board and you say well no
[31:13] they're the weakest yes but if you
[31:15] understand chess they are the greatest
[31:17] diversion you have you move a pawn over
[31:23] here and it gets the opponent what's he
[31:25] doing what's he doing now well the
[31:29] opponent thinks I want his King right I
[31:34] want checkmate on him so I'm not going
[31:37] to concern myself right now with that
[31:38] pawn
[31:39] watch it that pawn can take out any
[31:44] other piece on the board including the
[31:48] King if he can get in position to do it
[31:53] you with me so it's not all these great
[31:56] big boom boom boom lightning and
[31:59] thunders sometimes it's the steel small
[32:04] voice which seems to be the smallest
[32:07] insignificant piece on the board and
[32:10] it's the one God's gonna use to work its
[32:15] way to where it's checkmate do you
[32:20] understand that that's why there's
[32:22] nothing wrong with well with
[32:25] understanding insignificance you
[32:28] shouldn't feel insignificant
[32:30] because God is no respecter of persons
[32:33] you say well brother I understand chess
[32:36] in the rook can do this and and the
[32:38] bishop can do this and the Queen can do
[32:39] this and everybody's focusing on the
[32:41] queen man if I can get the Queen broke
[32:43] free she can move around yeah but if she
[32:45] ever gets taken out by a pawn
[32:47] you're just about finished you've lost
[32:50] the most important piece on the board
[32:52] outside of the King and notice the Kings
[32:55] always in the back huh he's always in
[33:00] the background and a good chess player
[33:02] is just barely moving the King just
[33:05] enough to stay out of the line of fire
[33:09] you don't have to feel insignificant but
[33:13] I'm glad that we are because the devil
[33:17] overlooks people like you and me well
[33:19] you don't understand brother my life is
[33:21] like hell right now
[33:22] but devil is on the warpath praise the
[33:24] Lord that means you might be on the
[33:26] Lord's side because if the devil ain't
[33:29] on you you might be in trouble you see
[33:35] what I'm saying and he is fighting
[33:36] everybody I do I'm a pastor but I travel
[33:40] one week out of the month because that's
[33:42] what the Lord has told me to do the
[33:45] congregation is okay with it and as long
[33:47] as they're ok with it brother Samuel huh
[33:49] go but you would not believe how many
[33:53] people are being pummeled because he
[33:56] only has a short time and did you know
[34:00] he knows it he still thinks in the back
[34:03] of his mind I might do this you
[34:08] understand I'm ight do this I might
[34:10] accomplish this but here's the other
[34:13] side of him if I don't I'm gonna take
[34:15] everybody with me if I gotta go down
[34:18] you're all going with me I Got News for
[34:21] him there's people who are walking just
[34:24] above that level and my mind goes back
[34:28] to the Book of Numbers where Nathan and
[34:30] Korah challenged Moses and Moses come
[34:34] off the mountain and God said now listen
[34:37] here you that are with me come on over
[34:42] I knew that or not stay over there and a
[34:46] humongous earthquake opened up the
[34:48] earthers started swallowing all the make
[34:51] believers and all the unbelievers and I
[34:52] remember one of the first messages I
[34:54] preached and it was just how did that
[34:56] how did the believer stand next to the
[34:58] chasm and not fall in how did the
[35:01] Israelite make it with all I grew up in
[35:04] California I know about earthquakes they
[35:09] were walking just above the surface of
[35:13] the earth you know this earth they were
[35:16] they were walking just above the sinful
[35:20] flesh as a type and did not get sucked
[35:24] in to the damage and brothers and
[35:28] sisters that's how close we are
[35:30] I mean we're just a hair's breadth away
[35:34] but as long as you got the Holy Ghost
[35:37] lift Jesus higher if I be lifted up he
[35:42] said I'll drop I'm in unto me do you
[35:47] love him
[35:47] you probably think I'm crazy I'm almost
[35:50] finished and only is to be revealed at
[35:54] the last day when this actual seal is
[35:57] broken broken to who not to Christ but
[36:01] to the church oh praise the Lord
[36:04] notice now oh my that just makes me
[36:07] tremble I hope that the church truly
[36:10] understands it what I mean you people
[36:13] I'm going to call you bride see watch
[36:17] now watch the difference between
[36:18] everybody else in the bride so that
[36:21] you'll understand it he's good to us
[36:30] please stand oh I can keep preaching
[36:38] brother you know no maybe for five more
[36:42] minutes while you're standing out
[36:43] because you know how it is see at the
[36:46] top of the pyramid now I'm a retired
[36:49] framer built a lot of houses and a lot
[36:53] of buildings shoulders are worn out from
[36:55] doing
[36:55] but when you get to the top the corners
[36:59] come quicker and faster and quicker and
[37:02] faster and but I'll tell you something
[37:04] about the top of the building if one of
[37:06] those corners is off at the top it's way
[37:08] more noticeable then if you got off an
[37:11] inch down at the bottom now a good
[37:13] carpenter can correct a foundation
[37:15] that's out of square he's really got to
[37:18] pull some tricks you got a noisy stuff
[37:20] but he can cover that up with siding or
[37:22] brick mold or whatever it might be but
[37:25] when you get up to the top and you got a
[37:27] little something medicator it's like
[37:29] well I am buying that house that corner
[37:34] up there I can see right now on that
[37:35] dormers out of out see brothers and
[37:39] sisters so that's where we're at we're
[37:41] turning the corners quick and fast to
[37:43] finish this and and you know that the
[37:45] capstone you've read this is not some
[37:47] big blunt instrument that slams down on
[37:50] the top brother branham said it was more
[37:51] like a needlepoint like a spire but we
[37:56] don't see it that way we just see the
[37:57] pyramid just terminating just like this
[38:00] at a de at a four 12 pitch but that's
[38:04] not what he said he said it goes up to
[38:08] almost a sharknado point did you realize
[38:09] that that's just about where we're at
[38:12] we're just about to the peak right of
[38:16] the peak of the peak let's pray Heavenly
[38:21] Father Lord were just thankful that we
[38:23] could have the opportunity and the time
[38:25] to share a thought with your children
