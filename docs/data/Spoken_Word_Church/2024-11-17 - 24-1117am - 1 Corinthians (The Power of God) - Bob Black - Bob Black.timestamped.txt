[0:00] I'm switch GE again and and this morning
[0:02] just start studying through the book of
[0:04] Corinthians and uh and uh the boy the
[0:08] book of Corinthians has some good things
[0:10] about just life and and uh and and
[0:13] situations and um but uh the first
[0:17] chapter in Corinthians if the brothers
[0:20] can pull that up is is is kind of
[0:22] dealing with um uh Paul makes mention of
[0:25] this statement the power of God so I
[0:27] wanted to kind of look at that this
[0:29] morning and uh before we get into the
[0:32] scripture let's just bow our his and and
[0:34] uh go to the author Lord God we're so
[0:37] grateful to be able to gather around
[0:38] your word this morning and I pray God
[0:40] that you'll Lord just move among us to
[0:42] Quicken it to us Lord Jesus and to give
[0:44] us the real essence of the meaning as we
[0:46] walk through these
[0:47] scriptures God I pray you'll guide us
[0:49] today Lord open our hearts help us Lord
[0:51] Jesus to understand be with us Lord
[0:54] Jesus that you'll be in our midst today
[0:56] we ask in your name amen
[1:02] is it not
[1:04] working I'm I'm asking to the
[1:10] air I think I got it connected right
[1:18] Brothers
[1:25] reconnect let's try that
[1:34] there we go there we go
[1:39] um
[1:41] technology all right power of God now uh
[1:45] before we get into this you can you can
[1:47] kind of get a sense already of what the
[1:49] power of God is that Paul said it's the
[1:51] preaching of the gospel and that's
[1:53] that's something to kind of meditate on
[1:54] why why is that and and uh as as we'll
[1:58] study this out
[2:00] Paul is kind of setting in our our mind
[2:03] well you know you can you can look at
[2:05] this scene of an old timey gospel
[2:07] preacher preaching and and everybody's
[2:09] listening to him and it's it's kind of
[2:12] odd the way that God sets this up is
[2:14] that there's a man behind the pull pit
[2:16] that you can look at that he's got the
[2:19] word and so you the the the kind of the
[2:22] struggle is is is you you start people
[2:24] start looking at the man versus the word
[2:28] now the power of God is the word word
[2:30] but if you start looking at the man then
[2:32] you get off kilter now that's the thing
[2:35] that that uh Paul starts kind of
[2:37] attacking and in this in this first
[2:39] chapter but before we get into that
[2:41] let's just kind of think about um the
[2:43] relationship between the Corinth you
[2:45] know we we know the Corinthian Church is
[2:47] a is a uh uh was the little baby church
[2:51] that had a lot of issues and and and and
[2:53] we'll get into why but you know uh Paul
[2:56] when he when he wound up you can see
[2:57] where how close Ephesus is to Corinth
[3:00] it's just uh well not close but um just
[3:04] just across the way there and Paul when
[3:07] he wound up in the in the coast of
[3:09] Ephesus in uh about 8053 you know he
[3:12] found out that they were uh they had
[3:14] they were being baptizing and according
[3:17] to John's baptism but they didn't know
[3:18] anything about the Holy Ghost so he he
[3:21] began to stay around there and position
[3:23] them and and uh uh and and kind of
[3:25] instruct them a little bit and left them
[3:27] with Aquilla and Priscilla and then and
[3:30] uh about 10 years later he was in Rome
[3:32] in prison and he wrote the he wrote back
[3:35] to the to the Ephesian church and and by
[3:37] then you think about that 10 10 years
[3:39] later they were a strong church that
[3:42] knew what they were uh what what they
[3:45] were Paul was able to teach them about
[3:47] the melchisedec and all of those kind of
[3:49] things but during that first little
[3:51] visit to Ephesus uh you can read in 1
[3:54] Corinthians 16 he said I'm going to stay
[3:56] in Ephesus until Pentecost so Paul's
[3:59] writing to the Corinthians from Ephesus
[4:02] um so that's just kind of a little
[4:04] interesting context there's a strong
[4:06] church that he or what will be a strong
[4:08] church that he's writing to this little
[4:10] weaker church this little baby Church um
[4:13] to kind of get them positioned and get
[4:14] them straightened up so he wrote this
[4:17] letter the first Corin the the the
[4:19] letters to the Corinthians he wrote this
[4:21] these letters to correct and guide the
[4:22] Corinthian Believers many of whom were
[4:25] CAU up in
[4:27] Sensations and superficial demon
[4:30] demonstrations now remember kind of
[4:32] maybe keep in mind what we were kind of
[4:33] laboring on the other the other Sunday
[4:35] about anointed ones it it's it's the
[4:39] word that's the main thing and so they
[4:42] were getting caught up in Sensations and
[4:44] things that that you know think the the
[4:46] minor the minor things instead of that
[4:48] they weren't really looking quite at the
[4:50] right thing they getting caught like as
[4:51] we'll find out in in the first chapter
[4:53] getting caught caught up looking at the
[4:55] people the ministers instead of the word
[4:57] that they're preaching and that led to
[5:00] division and immaturity in the Christian
[5:03] walk so you can see in 1 Corinthians
[5:06] chapter 3 Paul says I I Brethren I
[5:08] couldn't speak to you as unto spiritual
[5:10] but you're carnal even as un babies in
[5:13] Christ that's the way that I have to
[5:15] talk to y'all um because you you know we
[5:17] we always say you I wouldn't want to get
[5:19] a if if you're misbehaving well you'd
[5:22] get a letter from Paul you know Paul
[5:24] he's he's he's wording this pretty
[5:26] strongly isn't he you think about Paul
[5:29] uh here as we'll read in in in the first
[5:32] chapter he heard from the house of Khloe
[5:33] that some they were they weren't
[5:35] behaving right and Paul gets his pen out
[5:37] and goes to WR now Paul he'd say some
[5:39] some kind of harsh things you know i' do
[5:42] you want me to come to you with a rod or
[5:45] with a spirit of meekness you know and
[5:47] and he' lay it out there for him uh uh
[5:49] so he's he's like I I fed you with milk
[5:51] and not with meat for hither to you were
[5:54] not able to Bear it neither yet now are
[5:56] ye able for ye are yet carnal what why
[5:59] what what makes you carnal is when
[6:00] you're just you're majoring on
[6:02] Sensations and feelings and which
[6:06] minister you're following and what
[6:08] church you go to and you're putting your
[6:11] identity on those things instead of the
[6:14] word of God that's carnal for whereas
[6:18] there is among you envying strife and
[6:20] divisions are you not carnal and walk as
[6:22] men so you know just to kind of compare
[6:25] quickly the cor Corinthians versus
[6:27] Ephesians like we were just looking at
[6:28] the Corinthians were focused heavily on
[6:30] experiencing the
[6:32] supernatural now now there's the balance
[6:34] in it we we want to experience the
[6:36] supernatural but but when you start
[6:39] leaning so much toward that side and
[6:40] you're not looking at the word that's
[6:42] when you got a problem the Ephesians
[6:44] were considered more rooted in their
[6:46] identity in Christ the Ephesians they
[6:48] knew they knew where they stood they
[6:50] knew their their identity was in the
[6:52] word of God not in all of those other
[6:54] things Paul could so Paul could focus on
[6:57] building them up spiritually explaining
[6:59] predestination inheritance in Christ and
[7:02] spiritual warfare and all those things
[7:03] that he couldn't talk to Corinthians
[7:06] about but the Corinthians they they face
[7:09] confusion especially regarding spiritual
[7:11] gifts revelatory experiences how to
[7:14] worship all those things so Paul
[7:16] addressed rampant disorder such as
[7:18] Christians exalting certain Supernatural
[7:21] experiences above others now to really
[7:24] understand the book of Corinthians you
[7:25] kind of got to understand the the the
[7:27] the context of what what he was
[7:29] preaching preaching to you know he would
[7:30] use they had this saying that well the
[7:33] uh stomach's uh food is for the stomach
[7:35] and stomach's for the food another words
[7:37] that and and Paul would use that against
[7:39] them he'd poke it so you say stomach's
[7:41] for the food and food's for the stomach
[7:43] in other words if you have a carnal
[7:46] desire in you then you might as well
[7:47] fulfill it and they would they would put
[7:49] that on like like go to the buffet you
[7:51] might as well eat all you want cuz you
[7:53] you got a desire and you might as well
[7:54] do that and the same way if you have a
[7:57] sexual desire you might as well fulfill
[7:59] that so he's he that was the context the
[8:02] background that they're they're they're
[8:04] in so and the reason for that is because
[8:06] in in
[8:08] uh at at the top of this hill called the
[8:11] aqua Corinth there was a big old Temple
[8:13] to Aphrodite and and this historian
[8:16] called strabo said that there was a
[8:17] thousand Temple prostitutes up there and
[8:19] so the way that the Corinthians would
[8:21] worship is they would actually go up to
[8:22] that Temple and engage with the
[8:25] prostitutes and so it was so Eng great
[8:27] you think about a society where they're
[8:28] they're worship in like that that's how
[8:30] they worship and and and if you're a
[8:32] Christian and you don't do that then
[8:34] you're you're you're odd you're very odd
[8:38] cuz that's that that's how the
[8:39] Corinthians uh that that was the mode
[8:42] that their society worked at so this
[8:44] kind of gives you an idea a background
[8:46] of what Paul is attacking with his
[8:48] doctrine that that you can't you can't
[8:51] and now maybe maybe just lay it out like
[8:53] this that we'll we think sometimes as we
[8:57] read this that this was a historical
[8:59] thing that does not have any really
[9:00] application to modern society but I just
[9:03] want to warn you again it absolutely
[9:05] does people get caught up in these
[9:06] things caught up in these ideas even
[9:08] today even message Believers and things
[9:10] that well I've even you know you come
[9:13] across people that they are raising
[9:15] their family up with the standard well I
[9:18] if you have an appetite for something
[9:21] you might as well fulfill it and I I
[9:23] just want to lay that out there as Paul
[9:25] did that that is wrong we we we want to
[9:28] raise ra you heard that saying raise
[9:31] your raise your boys to be gentlemen and
[9:32] your girls to accept nothing less you
[9:35] you want to raise your family up with a
[9:37] standard of Holiness even if they're not
[9:39] born again they're living in your home
[9:41] and you raise them up with that standard
[9:43] that we're we're not going to go behave
[9:44] ourself like a Corinthian and and you
[9:47] can see here that the the Greeks
[9:49] actually had a a word a slang word in
[9:52] the Greek language called that it was a
[9:54] Greek word but it meant to corinthianize
[9:56] which meant to practice sexual
[9:59] immorality and that's how bad the
[10:00] Corinthians were is that they they it
[10:03] actually became a BL a by word to
[10:06] corinthianize just just to fulfill your
[10:10] appetite like that saying that Paul used
[10:12] at them uh stomach for food and food for
[10:16] stomach so divisions now we're going to
[10:20] kind of skip over the first part of that
[10:22] chap of chapter one where Paul is is is
[10:25] he does his greeting and and tells them
[10:27] that you're you're called to be to be
[10:29] Saints and all of those different kind
[10:30] of things but when he gets down to verse
[10:32] 10 then he really starts he he gets that
[10:35] paddle
[10:37] out and he goes he goes to writing at
[10:39] him and he says now I beseech you
[10:42] Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus
[10:44] Christ that you all speak the same thing
[10:46] so they got they got divisions on them
[10:48] and and we want to examine why they got
[10:50] divisions because that the same reason
[10:52] why they had divisions is the same thing
[10:54] that divides many Believers even
[10:57] today but that you be perfectly joined
[11:00] together in the same mind and in the
[11:02] same judgment for it had been declared
[11:05] unto me of you my brethren by them which
[11:07] are of the House of Khloe that there are
[11:10] contentions among you so there's a
[11:12] little sister named Khloe we don't know
[11:14] much about her but I got like just a
[11:16] little a little illustration of a house
[11:18] what it could have looked like and of
[11:20] course we don't know she might have been
[11:21] a a a more wealthy person that lived in
[11:24] Corinth she might have had a house with
[11:26] with servants or or slaves even who
[11:28] knows and but somebody in that house got
[11:31] wind that uh they begin to notice some
[11:34] things were off and they they let Paul
[11:37] know so Paul's writing First Corinthians
[11:40] because Khloe somebody in Khloe's house
[11:43] told on
[11:44] them and so Paul's going to set things
[11:47] straight he said now this I say that
[11:49] every one of you saith now now here's
[11:50] where the divisions are coming in here's
[11:53] every one of you say saith I am of
[11:56] Paul they're looking at the man for
[11:58] their identity right I'm a Paul cuz he
[12:01] you know he started he's he's laying out
[12:03] the church age it'd be pretty good to
[12:05] say you're I'm a Paul right you'd think
[12:08] like that I of Apollos Apollos was like
[12:11] one of those preachers boy he could just
[12:13] sling the word out and leave everybody
[12:15] and oh wow I've never heard preaching
[12:17] like that I of sephus Peter Peter you
[12:21] see it'd be good to say well I'm a Peter
[12:24] brother brandom said that Peter was the
[12:26] only one that could open up the door of
[12:28] the Holy Ghost the Jews the Gentiles and
[12:30] the
[12:31] Samaritans now You' you'd think it'd be
[12:33] pretty good to just kind of grab onto
[12:35] his coattails and say well I'm I'm
[12:37] making my him my identity I'm
[12:41] identifying my Christian walk with Peter
[12:44] or or even some would say of Christ to
[12:47] say that they're more spiritual than
[12:49] others to that's that's what they're
[12:51] getting at so so Paul's laying it out he
[12:54] he he says to say I'm a Paul following
[12:56] Paul we found of the church or I'm a
[12:58] Apollos following Apollos who was known
[12:59] for his eloquence or I'm of sephus
[13:02] following the most prominent Apostle or
[13:04] I'm of Christ possibly claiming a
[13:06] superior spiritual
[13:09] status so Paul says now this I say that
[13:11] every one of you saith I am of Paul and
[13:14] I have Apollos I have I have sephus and
[13:16] I have Christ is Christ divided was Paul
[13:21] crucified for you or were you baptized
[13:23] in the name of Paul I thank God that I
[13:26] baptized none of you but Crispus and gas
[13:29] lest any should say that I had baptized
[13:31] in my own name and I baptized also the
[13:34] household of stefanus besides I know not
[13:37] whether I baptized any other for Christ
[13:40] sent me not to baptize now now here's
[13:43] this is where he's setting up the
[13:44] division he he didn't send me to do all
[13:46] these things but he sent me to preach
[13:49] the gospel now there's what we're
[13:52] getting the power of God is in the word
[13:54] not in not in a man that you're looking
[13:56] at not somebody where you and this is
[13:59] where it gets confused we're going to
[14:00] look over here in the book of Acts for a
[14:01] second where Peter pet
[14:04] everybody Peter's the one laying hands
[14:07] on Believers and they're receiving the
[14:09] Holy Ghost Peter's the one that's
[14:11] preaching the gospel and and signs and
[14:13] wonders are being done and the trap is
[14:15] that you start identifying yourself with
[14:17] the man instead of the word of God now
[14:21] that's that's kind of a a he so Paul let
[14:24] me just finish that that scripture he
[14:25] said for Christ sent me not to baptize
[14:27] but to preach the gospel not with wisdom
[14:30] of words lest the Cross of Christ should
[14:33] be made of none effect Now isn't that
[14:37] kind of an interesting dilemma that
[14:38] you've got a man that's carrying the
[14:40] Bible and you start looking at the man
[14:42] instead of the word it it's it's the man
[14:45] up there that's that's laying hands on
[14:46] people and praying for them like Peter
[14:48] was doing in the book of Acts chapter 8
[14:50] but it's the word their faith in the
[14:52] word of God not the faith in the man
[14:55] that actually does the does the work if
[14:58] you start look believing in the man then
[15:00] then it it you there's nothing concrete
[15:02] there that will actually give you
[15:04] Deliverance or healing or anything like
[15:06] that but the word of God is the thing
[15:09] that powers us the word of God is is
[15:12] actually well Paul would lay it out is
[15:13] it's the power of God in other words the
[15:15] word of God brings life the word of God
[15:17] brings Deliverance the word of God
[15:19] brings healing the word of God makes the
[15:21] chains fall off the word of God but you
[15:23] start looking at the man and everything
[15:25] gets gets uh gets off-kilter so that's
[15:28] what the Corinth were doing the
[15:30] Corinthians were essentially creating
[15:32] competing versions of Christianity based
[15:34] on which leader they followed they
[15:36] weren't just picking favorites they were
[15:37] staking their entire spiritual identity
[15:41] and validating their salvation on their
[15:43] association with particular leaders so
[15:45] in other words saying well if you don't
[15:46] go to my church you're out or if you
[15:48] don't follow a particular preacher
[15:50] you're out or if you aren't in my group
[15:52] you're out that's that's what uh that
[15:55] that's what created divisions then and
[15:58] that's what created divisions now is
[16:00] instead of looking singularly like they
[16:03] did on the day of Pentecost when the
[16:04] Holy Ghost fell at the word of God and
[16:07] that what God promised instead began to
[16:09] look at at at at the people
[16:14] right so this was and and these are just
[16:16] my notes just some just some statements
[16:19] here to kind of keep me in line but this
[16:20] was far more serious than just picking
[16:22] teams that were creating different
[16:23] brands of Christianity basing their
[16:26] spiritual legitimacy on their chosen
[16:28] leader and using their leader
[16:30] associations as proof of their spiritual
[16:33] superiority effectively creating
[16:35] different gospels based on who baptized
[16:37] them or taught them well if Paul
[16:41] baptized me then that's how that was
[16:42] that's what makes me a Christian no what
[16:45] makes us a Christian is the word of God
[16:47] grabs a hold of our life and changes us
[16:49] well if I go to this particular church
[16:51] that what makes me a Christian no if if
[16:54] the word of God changed your life that's
[16:56] what makes you a Christian now and and
[16:59] you can see you brother BR would say the
[17:02] three things that catches a minister is
[17:03] money women and popularity well what po
[17:05] what's popularity is to be in the word
[17:08] and change the meaning of the word so
[17:09] that instead of looking at the word
[17:11] they're looking at the man instead of
[17:13] you instead of they're looking at the
[17:15] man instead of the word that's and and
[17:18] and and uh so I I want you to just look
[17:21] at how amazing this is really in First
[17:24] Corinthians that Paul could have taken
[17:27] the opportunity
[17:29] to say yeah y'all do need to look at me
[17:33] but instead he directed them back to the
[17:35] word just like brother branam would do
[17:37] he'd say I don't want I'm not getting
[17:39] everybody to look at me I want you to
[17:41] look at Christ Christ is always the main
[17:45] thing that's right amen
[17:47] am now compare that with uh over in the
[17:50] book of Acts there was this man the
[17:53] Simon the Sorcerer he's called the
[17:55] sorcerer because it says he was
[17:56] bewitching the people that that he was G
[17:58] giving out that he was the power of God
[18:01] now contrast this this is exactly what
[18:03] we're talking about the word is the
[18:04] power of God versus Simon rising up and
[18:07] saying no I'm the power of God in Acts
[18:10] chapter 8 it says there was a certain
[18:11] man called Simon which Before Time in
[18:14] the same city used sorcery and bewitched
[18:16] the people of Samaria giving out that
[18:19] himself was some great
[18:22] one to whom they all gave heed from the
[18:24] least to the greatest saying this man is
[18:26] the great power of God and to him they
[18:29] had regard because that of long time he
[18:31] had Bewitched them with
[18:33] sorceries and it doesn't explain what
[18:35] kind of sorceries it it could have been
[18:38] uh magic tricks it could have been
[18:40] parlor tricks it could have been
[18:42] something to it something under the
[18:44] order to make them think that this man
[18:47] had the power of God but when they
[18:50] believe Philip preaching the things
[18:51] concerning the kingdom of God in the
[18:53] name of Jesus Christ they were baptized
[18:55] both men and women then Simon himself
[18:58] believed also and when he was baptized
[19:00] he continued with Philip and wondering
[19:02] wondered beholding the Miracles and
[19:05] signs which were done now this is this
[19:07] is kind of an important little story
[19:08] because this is always what they threw
[19:10] in brother brandom's face everywhere he
[19:11] went you're Simon the Sorcerer And and
[19:14] brother Bram would it
[19:16] it's you look at this is such an odd
[19:19] situation because here's Peter that
[19:21] laying hands on people and the Holy
[19:24] Ghost would fall and and it seems odd
[19:27] that because it's like
[19:30] you uh trying to trying to think how to
[19:33] frame it the one that's laying hands on
[19:37] on on the sick and they're recovering
[19:40] the one that's engaged it looks like
[19:43] like even today where people are poking
[19:44] at brother brandham and saying that's
[19:46] false but that was the one that was
[19:48] genuine but the one that that brother
[19:50] brandham said had like a a well let's
[19:53] see what he said about Simon the
[19:54] Sorcerer he said Simon the Sorcerer had
[19:57] a church and it was a formal Church
[19:59] perhaps a state church and he had them
[20:01] all bound down bound down by what bound
[20:04] down by believing that he was the only
[20:07] one that had the truth and they didn't
[20:09] have no joy and they didn't have any
[20:11] power but when Philip come down he
[20:13] preached to them Christ resurrected
[20:15] great joy came and healing came and then
[20:17] Simon wanted to buy that power see how
[20:20] backward they had it it was the formal
[20:23] stiff one that had was doing the sorcery
[20:26] not the healing or the power power of
[20:29] the Holy Ghost it was just vice versa
[20:32] now where does the power come from the
[20:34] power comes from the gospel the power
[20:37] comes from the word of
[20:42] God so the question is you know where
[20:45] where do you get your
[20:47] identification you know if you if you
[20:49] say you're identified because you're
[20:50] following a certain man or something
[20:52] like that and brother brandom always
[20:54] pointed to Jesus Christ every genuine
[20:57] preacher will always point to Jesus
[20:58] Jesus Christ we don't get identification
[21:01] from a man we get it from the word of
[21:03] God now I I just to kind of belabor the
[21:06] point you know that can that can work in
[21:08] a in a harmful way I was listening to
[21:10] one of the a very popular preacher that
[21:13] uh was sharing how that uh he was
[21:15] sitting in church when he was a young
[21:16] man I'm not going to say his name
[21:18] because I don't know if he wants this
[21:19] story shared but he was sitting in
[21:20] church and a minister came down the
[21:22] aisle and just looked at him and said I
[21:24] tell you what your problem is you got a
[21:26] problem of Pride and and if you're
[21:28] getting your identification from the
[21:30] preacher instead of from the word of God
[21:32] then you can do like he did and he said
[21:34] it it just he went into a just a a place
[21:38] of Despair and wondering if there was
[21:40] something wrong with him until he began
[21:42] to well what he did he talked to another
[21:44] Minister and he told him well that
[21:45] brother just that brother says that kind
[21:47] of stuff all the time and and and so you
[21:49] know you puts it in a different category
[21:51] stop looking and listening and just what
[21:53] someone's opinion about you and look to
[21:55] the word of God and in other words the
[21:57] word of God is where you where the word
[22:00] of God is the only standard of whether
[22:02] you're born again or whether you're
[22:03] really a holy ghost believer of whether
[22:05] you're doing right it's the word of God
[22:08] the word of God is you can get so caught
[22:11] up in whether somebody likes you or
[22:13] whether somebody doesn't like you and
[22:15] that doesn't not matter as much as the
[22:17] word of God I remember even in my own
[22:20] life I remember a time when when uh you
[22:23] know coming out of church or uh uh at
[22:25] this at this particular place and all of
[22:27] these Believers were ga gathered around
[22:28] and this brother got in my face and he
[22:30] began to tell me well you're I'll tell
[22:32] you what your problem is you just want
[22:34] popularity and and you that's a good
[22:36] thing to ask you know you you you just
[22:38] want popularity you just you're just a
[22:40] popularity preacher and it it uh and I'm
[22:43] sharing this because it'll give you
[22:47] Liberty you you began to you because I
[22:50] was you know I began to realize later
[22:52] that I was seeking my identification
[22:55] from what somebody else said instead of
[22:57] from the word of God and it'll bring you
[22:59] to a place where you just well it did
[23:02] for me where I I was in such a state of
[23:04] desperation and despair and depression
[23:07] that my wife would even say now she said
[23:09] I didn't know I thought that you had
[23:11] stopped loving me it brought me to such
[23:13] a low place because I was relying on
[23:17] what somebody else said about me now now
[23:20] where you can apply this is people
[23:21] always want to label you they want to
[23:23] label you as a Pentecostal they want to
[23:25] label you as an intellectual they want
[23:27] to label you as a prideful person or is
[23:30] that somebody that just wants popularity
[23:32] that just wants to seek after your own
[23:34] fame or fortune or whatever but none of
[23:37] that matters what matters is what the
[23:39] word of God says so where you get your
[23:42] identification is is the word of God now
[23:44] that if you really take that to heart I
[23:47] I think it'll give you Liberty to not
[23:49] not be so caring about whether somebody
[23:51] says that you're yeah you know whatever
[23:55] that you're mean or this or whatever a
[23:57] long list of attributes that somebody
[23:59] can label you on your life when you're
[24:01] trying to please somebody else or trying
[24:04] to get your identification from a
[24:06] minister or something that that you will
[24:08] always fall short your identification
[24:11] comes from maybe go back and listen to
[24:13] the sermon identification that's a good
[24:15] one to listen to your identification
[24:17] comes from the word of God
[24:22] Amen so Paul saying in 1 Corinthians
[24:25] chap 1 verse 17 to 18 he said for Christ
[24:29] sent me not to baptize but to preach the
[24:32] gospel not with wisdom of words lest the
[24:35] Cross of Christ should be made of none
[24:37] effect for the preaching of the Cross is
[24:39] to them that perish foolishness but unto
[24:42] us which are saved it is the power of
[24:46] God now there's a just justos that the
[24:49] power of God to the world is a bunch of
[24:53] foolishness and it's foolishness it was
[24:55] foolishness to the Corinthians because
[24:57] to the ancient world the idea of
[24:58] worshiping a crucified savior SE berser
[25:01] the the cross is the is the foolishness
[25:04] to the world Greeks valued sophisticated
[25:07] philosophy and wisdom Jews expected a
[25:10] triumphant powerful Messiah the con the
[25:13] concept of salvation through a crucified
[25:15] man seemed illogical to both groups but
[25:19] it's the power of
[25:20] God what appears as foolishness to human
[25:23] wisdom is actually God's deepest wisdom
[25:26] the foolish message of the cross
[25:28] actually demonstrates God's power this
[25:30] apparent weakness overcomes human
[25:32] strength this seeming foolishness
[25:35] overcomes human
[25:37] wisdom and the Seal of God brother R
[25:40] would say what is the gospel not the
[25:43] word only Paul said the gospel come not
[25:46] to come to us not in word only but
[25:49] through Power and demonstration of the
[25:51] Holy Ghost come the gospel amen that's
[25:54] why it's the
[25:55] power Paul said I never come with some
[25:57] Seminary Ed ation come making big swell
[26:00] words for your salvation to be based
[26:01] upon swelled words and enchanting lips
[26:03] and some doxology or Apostles Creed or
[26:06] something like that I never come to you
[26:08] like that but I come to you knowing only
[26:10] one thing the power of the resurrection
[26:13] of Jesus Christ and the demonstration of
[26:16] the Holy Ghost God give us some more
[26:19] Pauls so what is the gospel the gospel
[26:24] you seow the the seed of the word in in
[26:26] a heart of an of a of real believer and
[26:29] it will do like a little Lily that
[26:31] begins to just begins to grow and grow
[26:33] up through the mud and all the muck and
[26:35] the m and it will you you talk about a
[26:38] power a power is where life is where
[26:41] when you're you're sitting there in
[26:43] church and maybe nobody else is is is
[26:46] reacting or responding but something
[26:48] begins to react in your heart like
[26:50] brother brand would say and look into
[26:51] the Unseen something begins to pulsate
[26:53] and it begins to move and the word of
[26:55] God planted in that good ground of a of
[26:58] a ped heart will begin to affect change
[27:01] and it will begin to grow up it will get
[27:03] it'll do something it will do something
[27:06] the power of the Gospel is to bring new
[27:08] life I got this little uh drawing that
[27:11] somebody made in one of Billy Sunday's
[27:13] sermons uh could you imagine sitting in
[27:15] a in a in a in a sermon where where the
[27:18] preacher gets up on top of the pulpit
[27:19] like that he's preaching some something
[27:22] that's alive he's preaching something
[27:25] that will actually do something in
[27:27] people's hearts and lives so preaching
[27:30] is the means I got a lot of notes here
[27:31] I'm just going to skim through that it's
[27:33] the means by which God has ordained his
[27:36] power to manifest in the lives of
[27:39] Believers and as the eagle stirreth up
[27:42] her nest he said oh I like to have sheep
[27:43] food good food the power of God the word
[27:47] of God the Holy Ghost feeds on it that's
[27:49] what the church needs tonight is good
[27:51] solid gospel preaching gospel teaching
[27:54] gospel salvation and a Gospel Holy Ghost
[27:57] we're not so interested in what this
[27:59] nation might not need a new president
[28:01] the city might not need a new mayor but
[28:03] what we need today is a good old time
[28:05] Saint Paul's Revival and the Bible Holy
[28:08] Ghost back in the church again that's
[28:10] what we need sheep food sheep fed on
[28:13] sheep
[28:15] food so in verse 19 he says for it is
[28:19] written I will destroy the wisdom of the
[28:22] wise and will bring to nothing the
[28:24] understanding of The Prudent where is
[28:26] the wise Where is the describe where is
[28:29] the disputer of this world hath not God
[28:31] made foolish the wisdom of this world
[28:34] for after that in the wisdom of God the
[28:36] World by wisdom do not God it please God
[28:39] by the foolishness of preaching to save
[28:42] them that believe now it that that's
[28:46] this is such a good chapter for anybody
[28:48] that doesn't no longer believes in the
[28:49] preaching of the Gospel anymore that
[28:52] that would just sit home by themselves
[28:54] and and and try to understand by
[28:56] themselves but I I I thank God that he
[28:59] give us words like this to frame
[29:00] everything to put everything together to
[29:02] know that when you come and sit in
[29:04] church it ain't in vain that something's
[29:06] happening just as much as when you go to
[29:09] the ocean and you can see the you can't
[29:11] see the water evaporating and turning
[29:12] into a cloud and turning into rainfall
[29:14] but Something's Happened nonetheless
[29:16] because preaching is the power of God in
[29:18] your life God bless you
[29:21] [Applause]
[29:27] Saints for
