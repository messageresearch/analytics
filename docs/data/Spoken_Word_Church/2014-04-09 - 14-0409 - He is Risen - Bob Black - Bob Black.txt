I apologize he just kind of hit the ground running and just kind of Mark 16 verses 1 through 6. I even had the text highlighted in this and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning they're still interested in anointing and making sure that everything's taken care of making sure that he gets the proper respect and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came under the Sepulcher at the rising of the Sun and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the Stone from the door of the Sepulcher and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great and entering into the Sepulcher they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were freited and he saith unto them be not a Friday you seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him you maybe see the Lord has blessing to the reading of his word now uh you know I feel like and maybe I don't have enough experience to speak on things like this but I feel like when you get behind the pulpit that you really have a a dilemma of of choosing two between two paths that you can either preach what uh something that will make people an impressive sermon a sermon with lots of facts and figures and things that will make people think wow he's he's really he's really all right or you can preach what is needful and I believe that in my heart I don't really know how do I know what is needful because the only one that can know the secrets of all men's Hearts is the almighty God and I'm depending on him tonight to show me what his need for what you need to hear from and and uh that's I believe when you get a real message then it's something that I I didn't get from studying I didn't get from uh just uh you know God gives things in different ways but last last week I was on the train and the train was rocking back and forth and I was riding into work and just the presence of the Lord came down upon the scene and just quickened the scripture to me that if I could take a little Texas morning he is risen and I'm not really smart enough to look and think about what time of the year we are that this is April this is the time of the Resurrection I wish I was that smart to but well I'll preach on his risen because it's that time of the year but it was it was quickened to me and God began to I I heard another Ministry talk about uh you know after he got the Holy Ghost and he'd be laying in the bed or whatever and somebody would begin to preach to him and that's how it is sometimes my prayer tonight is that if I can deliver this the way it was delivered to me and I believe it will be a help to me and I I you know God it's so simple is one of the things that he's so great about him is that he can't take something so it take as great as he is and he can come down and reveal himself in a way that we can understand and maybe one of the most simplest little scriptures in the Bible this morning tonight would be so profound that he is risen now so as I was studying on this scripture and just meditating on it it was just quickened to me to check the date and see what kind of date you know we should be aware of the day and the hour that we're living in and I know my wife and I were talking on the way over here about how uh you know there's there's upcoming four blood moons and Then followed by six full moons and I I don't pretend to understand all the different things but I know that something's happening something's taking place so I looked at the calendar and I I went back and looked at what the the day uh you know brother Branham laid out the dates of the of of the when he said that Jesus wrote into Jerusalem on A.D the uh I believe it was A.D the second and uh he in A.D 30. April I think and and then so he rolled in on Palm Sunday on April the 2nd and April the 4th he preached Matthew 24. and I just put it on the calendar and and then so on Friday he was crucified and then on April the 9th he rose when today is April the 9th you now we're we're not maybe weren't aware of it this morning as you know I woke up this morning I was riding in on a bus and I was thinking 1984 years ago today and you know 1984 years ago today he rose from the grave you can look back and think of what think about that that he rose from the grave today and this this little scripture that we just read took place almost 2 000 years ago as these little sisters came to the tomb and saw that he the angel told them that he's not here he is risen now we're here this afternoon as the hours growing dark physically naturally but you know he said he promised it around about the evening time it would be light now I pray that tonight the the light of his Gospel of the of his of his own self of his own Glory would shine upon us and open up the word to us now when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him they were think about the type of people that came Mary Magdalene who brother random said was you know talk talked about how she was a sinner and the Bible teaches us that she had Seven Devils cast out over this you you know you think about Grace that the the maybe one of the worst people in the New Testament was there the first one that was witness of the Resurrection the first the first to be present and she was just I I was reading the different commentaries and one said that she was an apostle to the apostles because of you know she kind of took the message she was one of the ones that was first on the scene and she took the message and ran with it he is risen of course nobody believed her at the first but she took it and and she was there in prison on the scene but I want to take a just for my topic he has risen what is the evidence that he has risen now if we were 2 000 years later I I think we say have the same kind of dilemma that they had back then you know they were concerned that they they came up to this point in their life looking for something expecting something that uh maybe the the way it turned out was a whole lot different than what they expected and they uh you know I imagine as they stood at the feet of Jesus on the cross looking up and and thinking I believe that this was the Messiah I believe that this was the one to come and Deliver us and they looked up and they stood at the feet of the Cross and you married Magdalene was one of the last her and John as they stood there and Jesus looked down and said woman Behold thy mother and and gave Mary over to John's care and all those different things took place at the cross but right there it something maybe it was a critical moment in their life the the everything began to come to a head and they uh what is what is happening what is taking place now as Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome they came at this particular Junction in time and you know brother Branham teaches us that all of these little people in the Bible as they came to decision points in their life they would look back at other people in the Bible for help and they would look back and and identify themselves in the scripture with someone else and maybe if I could just paint a little picture maybe they identified themselves at this particular maybe they remembered back that story of of Lazarus and Mary and Martha as they came to a similar Junction in time and you know remember about how brother Branham told that story of how Martha how when Lazarus was sick became sick and how he he passed away and Martha maybe she was going through a time in her life where she wasn't such a strong Christian anymore she was going through a little wobbly time of her life and sometimes that's how God does this he'll throw us into a situation pull the ground out from under us to see if we still believe him if we still take him at his word and and so she had the ground pulled out from under her she her brother was going into the ground and and why is Jesus taking so long what is taking so long and when he arrived because everything was just perfectly in line with his time with his great plan and purpose everything was moving just according to plan and you know the Bible says you say that God is is slumbering and sleeping and waiting but the clock is ticking even now just according to his great plan and purpose it's moving along just fine he's not delaying his coming and so he he arrived upon the scene and Martha didn't jump at him and and uh get down his throat or anything she jumped down his throat but she said uh Lord if you would have been here and I I I think so often you know no matter what circumstance a real true Christian if you've got that Rod of faith that that's just anchored so far deep down and you you always say no matter what the circumstance Lord Lord even now if you would if you would have been here if you'll say it Lord I believe and I was thinking about how you know as we come up to be prayed for you know I think one of the biggest uh don't take me the wrong way almost one of the biggest slaps in the face of the lord it's to it's to come up Time After Time Lord Heal Me of whatever I have need of I'm coming for healing I accept my healing and then go back to our seed and the next Sunday come right back up because we're denying what God has done for us if he'll claim what he said he'll do if he'll take him at his word and say Lord even now you're able to do it even now Lord if you would have if you would Lord just I believe that you're still able to come upon a scene and heal and deliver I believe that you're still able Lord and so Mary uh Martha there at that little conversation that she had with Jesus Lord even now and he said your brother will rise again he'll rise again because you know they they all believed that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection they had that and uh he said she'll he'll rise again and see she said surely Laura in the resurrection he's been he's been a good fella he's been a nice nice good churchgoer all those things he's been wonderful but surely I believe that I believe the gospel that he'll rise again I understand I have an understanding of these tenets of the faith and he said I am the resurrection and the life and he went out and he went out to the grave and rolled they rolled back the stone and that putrid smell came out and it just about knocked everybody over and he stood there and he called forth that voice called forth Lazarus you know you can read stories like that and and uh I I think oftentimes you can listen to the sermons that the prophet preached and there's uh get an understanding of the power of God and different things but then you can just keep going down and down and until there's a deeper a revelation in there and even in that little story how Martha Jesus called Mary through and he told Martha to go get her she answered the call she answered the shout and then the voice raised up Lazarus from the grave and then in the next chapter we read how they were all called to a wedding supper they were all called that the trumpet calls us to the wedding supper in Disguise you can see a deeper in in that little simple story something deeper and deeper but as you just keep listening to the prophet you listen you get like a a a a basic understanding about the power of God and then you keep listening and you get deeper and deeper until you begin to see things that we were on the way up to church tonight we were listening to the token and I I was thinking I feel like you know years ago I didn't understand half of what I understand now because it's not something that I've I've learned just by by studying like I'm in school but something that's been quickened inside of me that I I'm becoming identified with a message I'm identified with what he's talking about the token is becoming alive in me and so Mary Magdalene and Martin and Mary they came to the tomb and the angel and I I believe it's Luke and the different stories that one one will say one Angel and another two angels but that angel came and delivered unto them a message delivered them the message that he has risen and you know angels are ministering Spirits because God sends forth Angels because he is concerned about our welfare and angels are concerned about whether we hear the truth or not and what we do with it angels are ministering to us I was reading a little a little quote where brother random was talking about how he it was a long line of people waiting to be prayed for outside his home and he went up to the line and and was just going down and there was a man in the line with a flat nose and the man told him uh he looked up at him quickly and he said uh don't go or you know he advised I forget exactly what the advice he gave him was but he said go over there here and and do such and such in his Quick List brother random looked at him he disappeared and angels are among us and you may not even be aware of it and brother Branham wasn't aware when he was going down that line of people waiting to be prayed for that there was a man that looked just like a flat nose but angels are are angels are concerned about us and concerned about whether we hear the gospel or not and now uh uh there's three you know you can look at the three different angels that kind of play a role in your life first there's the angel of the Lord that appeared over brother Brandon's head in that in that Houston Coliseum that we have a picture of and you can put that picture on your mantle and say there is a picture of the Angel of the Lord and they come on down and there was the angel of the church age the messenger to the church age that brought us to revealed us these Hidden Truths that were hidden down Through the Ages and now remained on to us and then you also have another Angel which is you know you remember I said in another sermon a while back that God has a trickle-down economy he reveals it up up high and it comes trickling down from one to the other to the other the other and you can give it to your children you can give it as it's trickle down to you now there's the angel of the Lord there's the angel of the church age and there's also the angel of the church when the angel of the church is concerned about your well-being he's concerned that you hear the truth he's concerned that you give your life to the Lord and now the angel the Angels gave a message to Mary and Martha to marry Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome that he is risen now you know uh you are all the different people in this church that I'm looking at this morning are special assignments from God from the up from the Angels God has given into the Angels charge to to bring you to the gospel to bring you to a revelation to a closer walk with God and you know the angels are concerned about your well-being they're ministering spirits to The Heirs of the Kingdom and The Heirs of the kingdom are the ones here that are sitting listening and you know I think it's interesting that uh you know a minister is many times ministers will try to elevate themselves and say I'm so much higher than you but here's what a minister does a minister feeds the people and you know there's one standing tonight but all the others are seated at the table of life and I I feel honored to be able to serve you as a minister of the Gospel to serve you of the table of life and you as you sit and are waited upon wait uh you know brother Roundup priest who is this Melchizedek and you know melchizer that came down in flesh so that he could Minister and wash the feet of the disciples so that he could he he humbled himself and told us that we should do the same thing we should behave ourselves in the same way there's no big eyes and a little use it's all we're all in this fight together running this race to try to get to the end to try to accomplish what's written in God's word now let me let me see where I am oh now so here you him uh I mean sorry he is risen he is risen uh what is the evidence what is the evidence that he has risen so now I want to kind of go through this scripture Mark 16 there's a few little things that happen in this scripture now the first thing that happens and we'll kind of go through them one by one the first thing that happens is that the angel testifies that he has risen and you know I think what I want to kind of do is compare what happens in each of these little situations with what the true evidence that he has risen is and we'll kind of look at these now as I'm speaking to you and I believe I pray bring forth the word of life speaking it you know you have a decision that you can either accept it or reject it you have uh you can uh take it and and run with it or say well I you know that was pretty good that was a good motivational speech or whatever but I I don't I'm not thoroughly convinced but now when you hear an angel speaking a lot of times I I I believe that a lot of times today many people will take hearing the angel as the evidence that he has risen but just hearing the Angels speak is not the evidence that he is risen the angel was convinced and he had evidence within himself but that is not the evidence just hearing the angel say He Is Risen now you can hear the message and have it sitting in your home with the Bible open the the tapes playing and you can hear the angel of the the angel of the church age speaking out crying out you can hear that angel of the Lord speaking out through him and you can say you can nod your head that's right but that is not the evidence that he is risen and I believe when you know we have a mandate that the evidence is to agree with every word I don't believe that agreeing is just nodding your head I don't believe it it's just saying yeah that's pretty good because you know this little simple scripture you can take it he is risen and I can tell somebody I can have a personal revelation in my own life that he is risen and I know he's written reason not because of what's on the paper and I can go and I can tell somebody else I believe that he has risen and they can say that sounds reasonable that sounds pretty good I believe I I believe that I agree with that but that's not the agreeing the way that the prophet taught it right that's not the agreeing because you are not thoroughly you don't have a personal experience that he has risen you're not you're not there's not something that's bolted down an anchor that you know beyond a shadow of doubt you know I was reading there's so many books written today proven whether or not he's risen or not uh I I I've got one that somebody gave me that's like 500 pages long and to be honest I hadn't had time to to even dip in it it goes into so much proven about this person's where this person's bones were buried and the Engravings on this different things like that but you can have a head knowledge that won't take you to the real Revelation that he is risen and that's what I'm speaking of this tonight that there's an Evidence there's a true evidence that he is risen and it's not found in knowledge and and you know uh you do the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the opening of the word and those kind of things and I'm I'm speaking of you know I was looking at um in the early in the early church ages uh around about the time of the first church age the irenius and Polly Corp and all those there was something that rose up called gnosticism and the whole the whole thing about gnosticism was that it was they they preached salvation by knowledge they preached that all of these that there was a group a core of of Believers that had this secret mystery that was being unveiled only to them and if you were part of that secret little group then they would teach you uh how to escape the bonds of this flesh to that the whole natural creation was something to be escaped from now see how close how close it sounds now we're not we're we're our goal is is to not leave this body behind laying down on the ground but this body must be must take on immortality it must be changed to take on immortality to be like him and that's what our goal is and it's not by just memorization by by just by theology by scholarly exercises but it's by the it's it's it's by a revelation it's by the revealing of his word it's by a personal experience that he has risen and you know uh I was thinking you know brother Dale in the Bible study mentioned that Moses Mama probably told him as they were or you know brother Brown did talk about that that Moses Mama educated him as they were as they would grow as he was growing up and told him who he was and and what he was raised up for and told him all those things but you know when it came down to to actually fulfilling what was prophesied and all all the different things that were said about him he tried to do it himself right he tried to make it work himself and that's one thing that uh behold I show you a mystery let me say it like that you can't do it yourself you can't you can try you can try to learn and study but until God drops down and opens up his word uh you won't have a full understanding of this of the scripture like that that little story we were showing of of of Mary and Martha and how there's such there's deeper meaning in the word there's deeper things that you can pull out that not you can pull out but God can show you like the little story of Arthur Neil and oxa that we looked at in Sunday school about how God revealing himself and his bride little little things in his scripture that that speak to you and show you how uh show you more about your relationship with him because you know that's really what the Bible is unveiling is him the seven of seals don't reveal us it reveals him and what he's doing in us and let me find out where I am a second hold on so Moses as he was being brought up his mama would tell him you know you're you're you are the deliverer you got a special purpose in life you're not like these other people you're not you you know when I was when I was being brought up I was told the same thing I was you not there's a reason why we don't fellowship with you know go to denominations and and uh there's a reason why we're different there's a there's a it's time we listen to tapes and we heard about it and and bible studies and devotionals every night and and those kind of things but that didn't that isn't what that wasn't just hearing it wasn't the evidence that he has risen for me and one day Moses had to come to his own and own personal experience now the same thing with with maybe Jacob's father telling him that about how all the different things that happened in his life and maybe Isaac's saying I remember when my father took me down to the bush and and uh tied me to The Altar and tied me up on it and maybe he lifted up his hand to strike me with the knife and I I just lay there because I knew I trusted him that everything that he was being led of the Lord to do whatever whatever was happening it was led he was led to the Lord and I I just I just put everything into into the hands of the Lord and waited to see what would happen and as he lifted up his knife and Angel stayed his hand and and God provided a sacrifice there and you know all those all those stories came back to Jacob but the stories just just sitting in church and saying I'm part of this was not an evidence that he was risen and you know the sons of Zebedee as they sat on their boat fishing you know they were all they all had a little company together with Peter and Andrew the sons of James and John and and Peter and Andrew they all had a little fishing party together and they worked together and one day Jesus came down walking and and gave him a little call but you know I believe that they were prepared for that ahead of time by their uh Zebedee speaking to him and teaching them that one day there's going to come a messiah and you'd be looking for him when he does come and when he comes he's going to do like this he's not going to deviate from the word he's going to be able to open the word he's not going to uh he's gonna you know be straight and blunt and he's gonna say it like it is and he's gonna he uh prepared prepare them for the for the day when they would be have that choice but now all of those things all of those things are good and needful we need to hear the word but you know and I I speak this because you know today a lot of uh is going around that that um just here in the message just awakens in you that you always were Eternal that that you just have a uh that just hearing it is not the evidence that he has risen and the evidence that that is not the evidence is because you can look around today and see men and women that have been in the message for 20 and 30 years and now they're falling away if they heard it and believed it back then why did they not continue on and now that's that's the the a real true Christian experience will always move because as the light shining from the East to the West is moving the Believers are moving along with it from justification to sanctification and if you stop anywhere along the way then you'll follow you'll you know Paul talked about how we're running a race and the race is not with each other this race is a peculiar race it's a race with only one person in it and your goal is not to beat the other people your goal is to finish it and you finish it by continuing on keeping on through God's plan without taking any shortcuts we're going on through justification sanctification batches but holy ghost and walking in the word until you meet the prize which is the change of your body now so what what is the evidence of he is risen and I want to skip over to Luke I'm kind of combining some of these stories some of the ways that they were told Luke chapter 24. because you know each of these four brothers that wrote Matthew Mark Luke and John that the uh the veil and the temple you know we you can kind of compare that with Matthew Mark and Luke and John it that Matthew Mark and Luke John are presenting Christ in four different ways kind of looking at him from four different angles you know let's look at it from a servant let's look at it from from as almighty god let's see what he looks like as as the lion of the tribe of Judah and it you can kind of turn around and and and just so we get a full complete picture a full complete view so that we have full understanding as we move on into the book of Acts where the New Testament begins and uh Luke 24 36. and we're moving through the the kind of the different stages of this of this journey as they came to the tomb and an angel delivered a message that he has risen he delivered a message and then they took that message and I'm skipping over a little bit they took that message and ran back and told the disciples he is risen and they they walked with on their hearts burned within them on the road to Emmaus as they they fellowship with him and they uh they they didn't realize that he was in their presence and then kind of skipping on down to Luke 24 36 and as they dissipate Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and say it unto them peace be unto you peace now Jesus they they were they were not they they were all doubtful they were not fully convinced that he was risen and so Jesus himself stood in their midst and said unto them peace be unto you and what was their response they were filled with power fear ready to go ready to run but they were terrified and afraided and supposed that they had seen a spirit and he said unto them why are you troubled and why do thoughts arise in your hearts behold my hands and my feet that it is I myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not Flesh and Bones as you see me have and when he had thus spoken he showed them his hands and his feet and over in one of the other gospels talks about how they handled his feet they handled him and touched him and could see that he was there because he was their present among them he was present with him now so that's the next thing I want to talk about first they heard a message an angel delivered them the message and next they got in the presence he was among them he was with them but was that the evidence now that now that you could say it's an evidence for them now don't get don't get confused in your mind don't get all wrapped up remember what I'm speaking of because today on this day two thousand years ago almost he rose from the grave but today we need an Evidence and he can't come physically among us today and and he won't you know he he won't come physically walking down the aisle of this church today but we still have to have an evidence that he is risen and that's what I'm speaking of now now look my the maybe the the main point that I'm trying trying to hit up on is his presence now when brother Brandon had prayer lines he could say he I was reading where he said he told one lady you can feel the anointing come on me they could feel the anointing come on him as they were at the in the prayer line they got in that atmosphere and they got in that presence and then many times they would walk off of the platform away from that presence and lose their healing they didn't they they would uh their faith would Wane they would uh get away from that atmosphere and uh instead of continuing on believing they uh got away from that presence now look what uh whenever the disciples got into that presence remember brother Brandon told about that story how they they uh began to go across the Sea of Galilee and he how he walked up into the mountain and he looked down on them and watched because he knew as soon as they got away from that presence as soon as they got away just like how we get away we'll get away you start letting little the little foxes that spoil the vine get in our life and as soon as that happens the devil begins to attack us and begins to kind of have more of his way with us and so Jesus went up on the mountain to watch and see what would happen is they went across that that the Sea of Galilee and he looked and the storm came up and the the winds and the waves began to roll and they saw Jesus come walking upon the water and instead of being comforted my goodness this man I know he's God because he's walking upon the Water they they were scared they thought he was a spook and that's how a lot of times people today they they're afraid of what will help them if they think that uh what's going on in in a believing church is is spooky and scary and and uh afraid of the way people act that if I get among them what if I what if I let out a big shout when the spirit comes down what if I what if I were to jump up and running around a little bit or what if you know what you get into a church where where the the presence Falls and people do begin to shout and it's a little bit uh maybe frightening to someone unaccustomed to that but now when when you really have a real experience something changes it's not spooky anymore it's not scary it's not you you something something changes now now my point is to not just just being around the Revival is not an evidence that he is risen because you know when they went over and asked that little Welsh policeman where is the Revival he didn't say over there he didn't say well my pastor has the Revelation as long as he understands what's going on that's good enough for me but he said I am the Revival what's going on is happening right here now you know the presence of the Lord I don't want you to misunderstand me it is uh critical and crucial because as those people will come up into the prayer line and come into the presence of that angel of the Lord they began to realize that God is real that God God wants to heal you that his desire is to see us to see us well to see us moving and and and and doing well his his presence brings Hope just like it did when Martha saw Jesus coming and Lord if you would have been here now she had she didn't have faith to know what would happen but she had hope that now you know everything's gonna be okay I don't know why Jesus waited but you know now Lazarus isn't in the ground and everything whether he's is is it's just meant for him to stay in the ground or not I believe everything will be okay but Lord I know that if you would have been here then he wouldn't have died now so don't it you know we say your the experience is not based on sensation but don't grow out throw out the feelings exactly because you know it's good when you when you get along with God sometimes you feel that presence of the Lord come down and you feel the feeling then that is that is a good thing that we're not based upon feelings but feelings are good I tell you when I when I was on that on that train and and the presence of the Lord came down and quickened this little scripture to me and and uh you know I I was wiping the tears away you know people are going to think I'm crying on the train for what in the world but now the feeling then was really good but that's not what I'm basing my experience on because you know you got five you're you're trying made up of of Body Spirit and soul and on the outside you got five senses and on the inside the spirit realm you've got five senses but on the inside the inside of the inside of the Soul you only have one sense you don't have that's why it's not by us all this sensation and everything because when you get deep down there's only one sense do you believe it or not it's either Faith or doubt that's you can have all the chills and all the emotion and everything on the outside but when it comes down to a new birth experience it's either do you believe it it it has has the faith of God come down and is living inside of you to give you his faith so don't stop don't stop at the presence that's right don't throw away the Good Feeling Just because it's not based on feelings don't throw the baby out with a bath water now now look now as Israel was journeying through the wilderness you know you could compare their experience with with what happened with Balaam now look they uh they uh they had Balaam had seven altars seven bull looks seven rounds seven seven sacrifices seven burning sacrifices they had a prophet that God was speaking through but there was something different that Prophet wasn't willing to stay a hundred percent with the word god whatever whatever you know that's one thing I I I find amazing is that I believe that brother Branham brother Brandon was not forced to believe to bring this message to us he had a choice he had a choice just like all of us and he he laid down his life for us he he would say goodbye to his kids and travel all around the world and his maybe his kids get on the phone and crying for their daddy but he left all of that for us to bring us the gospel he didn't have to do that and you know look at look at the choice that Baylor made he he wasn't forced to choose wrongly but he he chose money and and fame and popularity and all the things instead of choosing he he say like this way he got up behind the pulpit and instead of choosing what was needful he chose what would bring him popularity he chose poorly on that crossroads of The Minister's dilemma and you know I all of these little types and shadows I think are just we all these types and shadows were speaking of something all these little stories that we read about all of them are leading up to today this very hour that we're you know be aware of the hour and the day that you're living in as we look and remember that on this day Christ Rose and all these types and shadows that were spoken of all down through scripture were leading up we're pointing to the day that there will not be any types or Shadows after you know we're standing at a at a at a moment in time where we're not you know their lives type something as as Mo when Moses came to the burning bush that typed the bad a personal experience that type something but your life is not typing something because it is the reality is the living reality of what all the previous all the previous people in the Bible spoke about so now Moses had been told about God he had been instructed and he had been taught just like Mary and Martha or Martha and are the two Mary's that and Salome that came to the tomb were taught by that angel and but then that teaching had to come to he had to come to a personal experience with God where one day he met that Pillar of Fire for himself and saw for himself something became real and then he wasn't afraid to go down into Egypt he was he took us instead of taking a great big army he took his little wife and his child and bundled them all up together and went down to Egypt that's why you know uh be careful when you let your kids learn about things from the Ten Commandments movie because there's a lot of things in that that aren't exactly accurate that's one of them that they uh he he took a little wife and a child down into Egypt and you know Jacob had been told about the angel he'd been told about the things that happened to his his dad and all and the things that happened to his grandfather but one day he met the angel himself and he wrestled with him and he got the blessing and after that after he wrestled with that angel he never walked again because the angel touched him in his side and caused that ligament to to to deform a little bit he he never walked the same and you'll never walk the same once you meet that same angel and you know the sons of Zebedee that Zebedee told them about told them about the master and and told them about the plan and everything but one day that man came walking down the shores of Galilee and said follow me and you know what they didn't have to say uh let me go talk to my daddy about it and make sure but you know they dropped I believe that day that business went out of business because they dropped everything and they went and followed him because that's the way of a True Believer is that you leave everything you uh any encumbrance anything that would wait the waste has so easily beset us that ties down to the things of the world you'll leave those things behind and I'm not advocating foolish living foolishness or anything but you understand what I'm speaking of ha and but you know all those things that they that happened in the Old Testament as Moses at the burning bush Jacob wrestling with an angel those were types of a personal experience they didn't really have the new birth inside of the Christ Living inside of them because for that to happen God won't dwell in an unclean vessel and first the atonement had to be made so that they could be clean so that he could come and live inside first first you must be Sanctified and washed and uh and I say that too because I'm beginning to realize how many people today believe that the uh oh my that in the Old Testament they had exactly the same we do that in the New Testament it's just a realization that it's not just a realization it's not just an Awakening it's not just a uh just uh like a the gnostics believe that it's just a you're coming to the realization of a mystery that that way that you're saved by knowledge but God God Reveals His secrets to us when we get the Holy Ghost and that's a different kind a different kind of knowledge knowledge not learned by by uh theology not learned by you know Augustine and origen and all those in the you could read their writings and they had some some amazing things to say and and very uh theological and laid out but you know there's a quote where brother random said it's not how you lay it out like that like not like that when the Holy Spirit comes and lays it out and puts it together like a puzzle so you don't have a cow up in the in the clouds or a cow up in the sky or something then this that's something that you can't do that's something that only God can do and that that's I believe a great mystery that you can't do it you cannot do it and many times we'll try to if I can just if I can just have summon up enough Faith but if faith is just really just simple believe in God's word let God take over let God uh let God have his way now we kind of look I know this is a real maybe simple message but you know I've listened to a lot of brother Randall's messages that are I was listening to the trial the other night that's pretty simple you know you know there's deep things hidden in all I don't mean to say that but God is revealed in Simplicity God the little the little simple things uh open up how great and how great God's word is and how great he is now so we looked at the angel delivering a message to to the two Mary's in Salome and then they got in the presence but still they were afraid something's something's not right everything's not uh that's not the evidence that I'm looking for that he has risen because we needed evidence today I believe I believe if we could you know you could uh like we were just talking about he just just laying out words we could look at all all through these different books and all through the different writings that evidence show that that that that he really was there that he really did live but you know you can still say well I'm not quite sure you could you could actually take somebody to the to one of the tombs over there in Israel and say well this is the place well maybe there's still room for doubt how how are you 100 sure that this is the particular tumor this is the particular place where he was crucified but when you get to the real evidence that he has risen there's no room for doubt when God shows you now I want to look at something just kind of interesting as we go to Acts chapter one uh bless you I'm sorry let's see yeah Acts chapter one verses 21 through 22 because now in verse 4 we read that they were assembled together together and assembled together with Jesus and he he gave them the commanded into they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he have heard of me and they were given that commandment to wait to wait until the Holy Ghost came now not you know brother Brian will explain it not wait and pray but just wait just uh wait and trust in the Lord when you have done everything that you know to do when you have done his his way and not not try to do it yourself try to work up something but just waiting on it and so they were told you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and they they went up to the upper room and they decided and and uh they decided that they needed it was time to replace judas's place in the church and now I want you to look at the requirements that they in the 12 disciples I mean look I want you to look at the requirements that they kind of put forth is that we want somebody that was there when the message was preached we want somebody that was there when he when he uh Rose from the grave and we want somebody that was there when he ascended we want somebody that was there and that will be in them and this person the evidence that he has risen and I I I I thought that was when I when I was reading that the other day I just thought that was so interesting that they that was their requirement for somebody that would feel the shoes of Judas now there's a space that Judas left and we're going to find somebody that just has heard the Angel's message and let me say it like that right and has been in the presence of the Lord was there when the things happened was was around was uh was present and but you know where is the evidence in his life that he has risen I'm not saying nothing about brother Matthias I know that many many scholars have written about how he became a pastor and I I hadn't read it in a while so I'm a little bit Rusty but how he became a pastor at a certain church and and did different things now I believe that the man the brother was filled the Holy Ghost but I'm just trying to make a point now their requirements the Holy Ghost had not even been given yet the Holy Ghost had not Fallen and they were looking for somebody based on on these two the things that I've kind of covered somebody that's just heard that's picked up a message book and just said and not of their head and somebody that's kind of said in a message church and being in the presence of the Lord while the spirit fell and said I think that's a good thing I think that I would like to stay there because it's a good it's a good church that I enjoy the fellowship I enjoy being around those type of people and that is the most dangerous place to be that is the most dangerous place of all to be especially in this time as we come closer and closer to a time where the the you know the foolish virgins that you if you read that scripture they were the ones that said Lord Lord and and Jesus said it's not the ones that are just called lord lord it's not the ones that are just Anointed with the presence it's just not the ones that just feel the power of God and and even cast out devils and do money wonders in his name and then they'll come to him and say didn't we do all these things didn't we cast out devils and and all these other things but he'll say I depart from me I never knew you and so what we're looking for is the evidence that he is risen and we a lot of times we'll place our own requirements on on what what the the new birth is a new birth is is something that's secret to you is something that God has done for you and and uh you know that when the when the sun was rising and back in the before the and when when God was creating the world he the the sunlight Shone upon his creation and it began to move and move upon the things and you know the first day the light came forth the second day he set things an atmosphere of creation and then life began to Spring forth and I was kind of studying on that and I I I noticed that you know sunlight can beat upon dirt and and things and it won't it just lays there and gets hot but when sun when the sunlight beats upon something that's germatized it begins to grow and flourish and you know the the evidence of of the Risen Christ is you could you could kind of compare that with with back then as the sunlight Shone upon the Earth and the Earth was going through a process you can look at maybe the a little fish being spoken into existence and then a little squirrel running out on a limb but the ultimate goal was for God to be made manifest in flesh and when Adam and Eve walked out in the garden that was the the culmination of the whole process now here the culmination of the whole process is not just here in the word it's not just being in the presence but the culmination of the of the process is the life of God being inside of you now when that life when that when that Dynamics came down upon the word when that body lay in that grave and the Dynamics Came Upon it and quickened it the only thing that could happen was that it sprang to life now that's what happens with a Believer when the Dynamics come and quick in the word that you've heard it Springs it to life and you begin to line up perfectly with the word you begin to come closer and closer throughout your life as you grow and grow closer and closer until one day you know because brother Randall said we'll be prickly until the body change you're prickly prickly prickly until all of a sudden you're changed and you're not prickly anymore because when you changed he said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also that you'll have a place you'll be just like him and you know the the way that Jesus comes he comes through the the through those three experiences like a thief in the night come he comes past the five outer sentences past the five inner senses and and he sneaks on in and it's it's so mysterious it almost that you know there's no experience there's no uh sensation you know the mystery of the new birth without Sensation that God could come and Quicken somebody and put himself inside of you and and uh without you know because a prickle up your spine and those different kind of things that's not the evidence well you might be sitting here tonight and and not feel anything but but the the the the spirit of the Lord being will Quicken and reveal his word to you now that same quickening power was there with Enoch when Enoch you know he had that testimony that he he uh stayed right with God's word and he built a monument in the in the over there in uh in the East Egypt where um a monument to his revelation and one day that quickening power quickened him so that he walked off the Earth and Elisha the same thing he that that the the anointing that was on Elisha was so strong on him I remember brother Brandon I'm talking about the shunamite woman and kind of uh explaining some of those things about how that the the anointing the power of God and that man was so great that when he came and laid himself on the shoot of my woman's boy he didn't he didn't pray he just the power of God he laid himself across that boy's body and he was raised up and when he died the power of God was still so strong in his bones that when someone died and fell in on top of his bones it was quickened and he came to he sprang to life again that quickening power carried to Philip after he expounded the word the Enoch to uh the Ethiopian eunuch and explain the word and it quickened him and carried him over to the a few miles away because the quickening power is the power of the Gospel the gospel that just in word only but the gospel is the power of uh the power of the Salvation of the word David now I want to at this time maybe just kind of prove what I'm saying with by going to some quotes because you know I can say many things but I believe it must be compared back to the Bible and the things that the prophet brought it's got to be compared back because you know Paul said if if you preach anything other than what I preached then even if you're an angel let him be accursed so um let's just kind of go through some of these some some of these things uh Brother Anderson let's pull up the first one it is the rising of the Sun and let's look for the evidence that he has risen and it is the rising of the Sun 1965. Satan doesn't care how religious you are or how right you are in your Doctrine if you miss that life you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been born again no matter how somebody else can explain the seals or all the different things if if that life isn't living in you and you have a personal revelation your own self then what good will all the all the the knowledge big stacks and reams of paper that explain all the different Mysteries all the different uh what good will that do because Satan is not scared of that he's scared of the life the life behind the name that's what cast out the Devils you know that little story of how Jesus came across the shore the Sea of Galilee to be there with the disciple he walked across the water why did he walk across the water because he was getting to that man of gadar or that insane man is what brother Brown said he was traveling all that way he was on his way to deliver that man of the devil and he delivered him by the power that was in him the power that he he told uh uh two of his disciples when their mom said what can I I forget which ones it was can I can they sit at your right hand one of your right hand once you're left are you able to be baptized with the baptism that I'm baptized with and one day they were baptized with that baptism and they that same power that was within him was in them now they could go forth through in the Greater Works because that's how the Greater Works are accomplished by that same life that same token life being present in them and we were coming over listening to brother the Brandon preached on the token and he said if you got the token now imagine this if you got the token like say a physical token like when I get on the train to go to work a physical token when you when I get on there and I swipe it or whatever I cannot be denied because I've got the proof I've got the token now when you've got that life that same life that was in him then how can God deny you not for foolish requests and things not not what I'm speaking of but when a real child of God comes and it comes and puts his request forth and holds that token up over your family over your children then God's got to honor that he's got to honor his life and brother Brandon explained it like like a light switch she said if when I go over and I expect when I flip the switch for the light switch to come on I I believe that the light switch will come on and if it doesn't come on then it's because somewhere the wires got crossed and if the wires are crossed in my life let me go back and examine my life and check things up and make sure that there's nothing in between me and my savior that everything's exactly laid out right that there's all the all the plumbing all the wire and everything's laid out just perfectly so that when I flip the switch the light comes on because that's what we we should have an expectation that God will hear and answer our prayers uh it shouldn't be remarkable when the other night last week I came home and and uh I got home from work and I walked in the door and my wife was she said I I'm so nauseated I feel sick and so I just grabbed her up in my arms and I prayed for her the Lord healed my wife and right then right then she said I don't feel nauseated anymore you know I say we shouldn't be surprised but I have to admit I was a little bit surprised sometimes you know when things happen that soon that's a miracle what God just comes on the scene like that and and you know sometimes it happens like that when you don't even realize that you have faith I was listening to a tape where brother random was preaching to a group of people and he said you don't need Faith you just need to know you just need knowledge to know how to wield it to know how to you know when you when the devil's cast out of and you three days later you start getting sick what's what you need a little understanding what's taking place you don't need more faith because faith is as simple as just taking God at his word in 1965 it is the rising of the Sun that's what I'm I'm speaking about it and that the rising of the Sun paragraph 70 and that Gospel Light of the Resurrection the confirmation of the word how did we know he was the Christ because he proved what he talked about it and that is the evidence that he has risen when that same life lives and you and proves that the things that were spoken about the types and the shadows and Moses and the pillar of fire and Philip being quickened by the power all these things that were spoken of in scripture now you are the Fulfillment of that type all these things that were spoken of before there aren't any more types after us this is it This is the End Amen How will I know the message of the hour God proves what he promised and he talks about it that is the identification that we are beneficiaries with him in the resurrection he proves what he has talked about what he promised to do in Christ he proved on the resurrection what he promised to do in the days of Moses he proved it what he promised in the days of Enoch he proved it in all the days of the Apostles he proved it now in this day he proves what he said because they are a part of that seed that was represented on the book of life that he came to redeem back to God again now there's a question for all of us there's a question for you is he risen and if he's risen then he's still the same today that he was 2 000 years ago when he rose from the dead because he's still risen the Bible doesn't say he was risen it says he is risen so do we believe that he's still proving what he said that he's still able to fill you with the Holy Ghost if you need it and let me just say this I think that's one of the things that I wanted to bring out when we were talking about that angel delivering his message that sometimes it almost seems like especially when I as I was growing up that that you know the devil can put in your mind that the Holy Ghost is like a popularity contest the baptism it only goes that it's something that is only a privileged group of people and you want to be part of that club but it's not it's not like that it's it's it's everybody if you don't have the the baptism it only goes tonight everybody in this building is on your team is on your side not to be not to be uh not to be part of a club but to be part of him to be part of Christ and it's not a popularity the thing about popularity if I can act a certain way then everybody will like me if I can if if I can do this or if I can if I can speak about the seals the way that somebody else does or or different things like that but it's it's about it's about the evidence of Christ Resurrection being in you and and having the power to do God giving you the power to overcome so if you have a problem in your life with with different things you know we this talk examples of cigarettes and alcohol and all these different things if the power of God is present in your life then it will deliver you of things that you cannot do by yourself he's more than able to deliver laughs and he's still the same yesterday today and forever let's go down to paragraph 192. now look Ben quickened you who were once dead and sinned and trespasses and darkness has he quickened what by his spirit that raised up Jesus on Easter morning from the dead and if it dwells in your mortal bodies now watch it also quickens brings to life and makes it subject to the word now how can you claim to have that spirit and throw yourself away from the word you're quickened by something else for it will Quicken your mortal bodies to the word you can't claim to be baptized with the Holy Ghost and then and then you know leave the word and say I you know I that's not true anymore that's that's not that's not correct and you know what else you can't do you can't correct the prophet you can't say I don't believe that the prophet knew what all what he was talking about because it's a trickle-down economy it's not a trickle up it trickles down from the angel of the Lord to the angel of the age to the angel of the church on down it is the rising of the sun paragraph 225 for no it quickened them to New Life it does the same thing for us now oh let me go back to that angel because you know a lot of people don't believe that they don't believe they'll believe that there's an angel of the Lord of course then you believe there's an angel of the church age but when you start talking about bringing it on down to an angel of the church do you mean I have to listen do you mean I have to go to church and listen to somebody else explaining the word to me you mean I can't just sit at home and and uh I just I'll just put in a tape and and we'll you know when you do that then you're getting off of the prescription because and that's Dangerous Ground especially after reading those quotes I just read and you you know you can well it is the rising of the Sun the quote I was just reading it it does the same thing for us now notice then they was so quick and in that quickening power the quickening power wasn't only in their soul but it was all over them not only the Dynamics come in to Quicken but it quickened the mechanics you see what I mean they were so quick until their tongues begin to speak in another language they were so quickened by the power of the resurrection of Christ until they lay their hands they were so quickened with quickening power to when they lay their hands upon the sick they got well it quickened your mortal body they were healed by laying on their hand but what about a quickening power that when you lay your hands upon your wife or your your children or or whoever that God that quickening power in you is transferred and can raise somebody up from from their condition the quickening power to take garments from the body of Paul and put them on someone and and and they'll be healed is that quickening power still the same today I believe it is paragraph 231 how can you say that that Spirit dwells in you though you've done everything that you thought was right here is your evidence whether you got it or not and this is the evidence that he has risen and you know when you get the evidence that he has risen many times people around you will not see that evidence that he has risen because it's not something you can just get from from Reading Theology and and uh but it's something where when you when Moses met the pillar of fire there wasn't nothing in the world could take that away from him he knew what he had saw what what he had experienced if the spirit that was in Christ is in you it also quickens you to the word amen for he is the word and if it contrary quickens you away from the word that it is of the spirit of Christ care what you've done until that moves you in the word my sheep hear my voice and they shall live by every word every word I was talking on that the other day let me okay let's skip down because I want to get on Matthias a little bit let's get down to the sign of this time 1963 let's see what brother Brown I know many have read that what brother Reynolds said about how Paul was chosen over Matthias but let's just kind of read through this look even the apostles after they tried to choose one because of judah's falling they cast lots and it fell on Matthias that was the best they could do with the keys to the kingdom and there is not a scripture wrote where he did anything but God chose Saul and ill-temper little fella but he had to throw him on his back one day and let him look up a while and he said I'll show him what great things he has to suffer from me see the church chose Matthias but God chose Paul and remember Matthias was chosen before the baptism of the Holy Ghost fell I wonder if they would have made a different choice if they had just waited a few days see that's the difference God always does his choosing his election God does that by election by his foreknowledge uh the Paradox John the Baptist was another one you know we don't have very much record of where let's see man pick man like they picked Matthias and so to take judas's place we don't hear very much about him God chose Paul CC that was God's choosing and the church is choosing and then influences skip down to the highlighted part man tried to elect that office one time they cast lots for it poor Matthias never done nothing but God chose Paul and he did something because he was anointed and skipped down but when God comes in and takes over then we see the anointing of the Holy Spirit vindicate the word of God and then the next quote trying to do a god of service without it being God's will who would say there wasn't a holy brother and talking about the disciples that chose judas's replacement who say they wasn't holy but they cast lots and it fell on Matthias and when he what did he ever do nothing but Paul was the elected one that was God's choosing a little no sarcastic High tempered Jew not the Matthias the DD you know he was but Paul God chose Paul the church chose Matthias and Skip down all right no matter who we think is right God knows who's best qualified because he knows the heart of man he knows and that goes for anything in life that goes for choosing a wife choosing choosing a church you know when you choose a church a lot of times it might take years before you really get a full understanding of what's really being preached you know I find that to be true when I talk to different Brothers you can say one thing from behind the pulpit but when you really get to talk to somebody you find out you know they don't believe that that in the Old Testament they didn't have the Holy Ghost and all kinds of different things but you don't know what's really in the heart of someone but God does and God knows what's needful God knows what we all have need of now I wonder if we just stand for a word of prayer as I close because I believe that he has risen and I believe that the power of God is still here to take care of whatever needs we have in our hearts and our lives and maybe uh you know we all have different needs we all have different things that we're struggling with in life but God is still able God is still able to deliver and and uh he's still the same Jehovah Jireh that he always was now so if you believe let me ask you this question I I if you believe that he's still the same and you believe that he's risen just raise your hand up and let's show the Lord let's just make a little wave offering to the Lord we still believe he's still the same as we go to prayer let's all borrow his Lord Jesus we just thank you God for your grace and mercy to us tonight and I know Lord that this was a simple little message Lord but I pray God that as we go on our separate ways Lord it may be something said will just resonate within our hearts and Lord it won't be a message that was forgotten but that will remember this week tonight Lord God that he is still risen that almost 2 000 years later that you're still moving in your people that you're still walking among the candlesticks Lord You're Still revealing your people Lord and a secret coming in this day Lord Jesus making yourself manifest In the Flesh of your people Lord God and you're still able to minister to whatever needs we have need of because you care and we know you care of God because you set your heavenly the angels and your Earthly angels to seek after our needs Lord to minister and deliver the food Lord Jesus to put food before us that we can eat from your table of life to make sure we have what we need of to grow through this process to run this race well Lord Jesus they will finish it Lord God every hand that was raised tonight Lord I know that we all have secret desires and secret needs Lord Jesus and Lord you said that our thoughts in heaven are louder than our voices on Earth you know Lord Jesus what we have need of you know the Lord that the secret goings out and comings and everything Lord Jesus Lord God I pray that you'll minister to us Lord Jesus touch us Lord God in this special way we pray Lord God granted I pray Lord that you're quick in your word to our hardest Lord Jesus and bless this Lord Jesus as we go our different ways Lord we pray granted Lord I ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ thank you it wasn't Peter that I've been on the mountain I've Been Everywhere ate with him
