you forgive our sins because that's where we want to stand complete in you and then Lord come and speak to our hearts and lives open truly the eyes of our understanding to the revealed word in Jesus name amen Ephesians 1 . now we were talking about this last night you know I think sister Trudy mentioned it and see Ephesians 1 I keep reading basically not all of it but do it but to me this is an entire Bible in its own in other words if you want to know what the Bible talking about read Ephesians 1. it covers everything from the new birth to chosen in him adoption the change everything is right there in Ephesians 1. so if you want to just keep reading over it and over and over it really helps me too anyway you know to read it so let's start with verse three they should be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted we're at in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he had to bound it toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will or to adopt us to to finish this whole thing up seeing this day according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of his word now if you would I'd like for you to turn with me to um let's go to John 6 first just read you know a few scriptures and then get into our thoughts John 6 verse 66. then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go brother random says in other words three things three kind of Believers he said unto and in verse 67 when you go out will you go will ye also go away but around the city in other words he was saying said do you wish to go away do you wish to go away you know then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go for thou Hast the words of eternal life and you believe and are sure that dot and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the son of the Living God okay go to John 10 verse 28. now watch these scriptures now and we know what it is we're talking about my sheep verse 27 hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never neither perish she'll never perish neither Shield any man pluck them out of my hand all right going over now to John 17. in verse 1 through 3. these words spank Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour has come glorify thy son that thy son also shall make glorified thee as thou has given him power no give it to the son power Over All Flesh that he should give and watch not if they had it and he can tell them that that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him right now they're not given to him you know remember the scripture uh no man can come unless the father drawing and this is eternal life now I wrote my Bible a long time ago what is eternal life that's what I wrote in my Bible many years ago what is eternal life verse 3 and this is eternal life Thee the only true God in Jesus Christ whom thou has sent that you may know not think about it and guess about it that word no is a wonderful word it's like it is in the Book of Job of job where he says I know my redeemer liveth it's a positive statement it's not even a question or point or nothing it's positive I know I know in whom I believe see all right so then you know eternal life can only come by Jesus Christ amen it is not because you and I are so good-goody people and and all of this that of the other that's right it's not on our merits it's on the basis of what he said all right now it's not to back up much but to review just a little bit of what we were talking about this morning and I told brother Joe to go ahead and title that what is the seed of God because that's what I want you to look at you know I did this morning what is the seed of God is it uh some kind of something that you got to put a spot well I was born with this seed in me what was it where was it amen I don't know I just believe the prophet well all right so do we all amen but remember Judas was there with him right you say yeah but I'm chosen but remember Judas was too that's right Judas had said if you've got he had part of the ministry he cast out Devils he was sick we better consider all right let's see what is the seed of God it's the word of God Amen well then it was it a word written down inside of you as I said tattooed inside of your soul somewhere or what was it or was it simply like the little woman that she had the germ of life she had heard and she believed that the Messiah would someday come back and she believed that but when he came that was what you know was quick under made alive right there but now remember what we were trying to bring out this morning and you know did that give her eternal life the prophet said the word Was Made Alive right there amen but did that give her eternal life another woman that touched the Hem of His Garment see she was healed did that give her eternal life and all the prophet said it was faith for the time because that's all those people back there could have right right David could kill a bear a lion and a giant and then say well Gloria come on anybody else because you know God has anointed me right and he knew it see and that was what I tried to get to point across see then the germ of life would be that that God foreknew right that you would receive when you came here all right but like I said about the little one like I said about Peter Peter emphatically stated by the Holy Spirit Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God but that didn't give him eternal life he had to wait till the death Pentecost but you see that's where we don't take things that I say and and break it down and look at it and take the the law of just dividing something until you see what's right you know if you were if you were taking a uh test today and it was a multiple choice well on the multiple choices I always say like four answers right and and on that there's always two of them that is so so out of thought until you just mark them two off and you're not dealing that's what a lot of people do though because they'll sit down there you know instead of just going down and looking at it and there's a question I don't work I don't work now to stream them too A lot of people they'll get that question number one well let's see maybe it's possible that could be true matter while the teacher says well who's answered all the questions I ain't got number one yet or maybe it could be true you hadn't taken a just an X Out the ones that's no good right you know and then you're only doing with two then you can just there's nothing else you can take a chance like I used to do and every other one is always true you got bound to hit it somewhere you know but but see if we don't do that we try to figure out anything stop trying to figure it out just accept what God Said Amen I haven't figured out yet what he saved me for right if you figured out what God saved you for so you just don't worry about it they just let it go all right let's see the little woman she had representation from predestination God knew she would hear the word and she would believe it above Five Season the things the religious people right and therefore he could come to that that was the seed of God that was what was in her not some form of some kind of seed stuck down in there you know go to remember how I was trying to bring it out now because science can't find the germ of life right well if they can't find a germ of Life how are you going to find a germ of eternal life I'm certainly not playing around the bean field but listen but God's foreknowledge he would look down through and he'd see that you wanted it so he had it there for you right but now he'd see that you wanted it now we got to move on see we've tried to cover something but we got to move on in the message to get some points and today I want to get something out of the way I know I've got a lot of quotes and things but I want to get something out of the way that should give us a you know a uh a thought and and take away some things and be able to uh walk on with what we're doing all right now but we read there he said I give him eternal life well if God's going to give you eternal life all right as I said this morning there's one thing for sure there's two things are right first he's going to give it to you that's his promise number two issue didn't happen that's right if I come into the world eternal life I've got one to Prophet said and you ain't going to get me to deny that I faced them before and about just none of them through there you know you can't get me to deny that Trinity because if I deny the father I've denied the son and they were kind of quote scripture to you like that just quoting it wrong right exactly yeah but they'll bring it to you that way because that's the carnality of man's kind all right but now listen when you're dealing with the word of God you see how vital it is for the word to be planted peering unadulterated come then we covered a message there I'm talking about it in non seed there is nothing to Quicken all right now non-seed is we know that it's it's it has no life in it right but in the Bible the of talking about the word those Pharisees knew the letter of the word perfect they could tell you everything that it said but when they face the Lord Jesus Christ they proved that they were none seed right there was nothing in them to Quicken right he said but brother Daley had all the words yeah and they could tell you all of the great Parables and all of the great things that went on they could show you everything go find you a good Jew now he can really explain or expound upon the word if you hadn't listened to anybody listen to that Rabbi Richmond come look at brother biscals a lot he can make it look so beautiful out of the scriptures let's see dead to the reality that's none seed when you're talking about Christians when you're dealing with the Christian realm when you're dealing in the religious realm I'd better say instead of Christian then the religious realm when you're dealing with it you're dealing with people that know the letter but yet if they don't have that germ of Life those Pharisees knew the letter that's right but they called Jesus Belgium all right the prostitute and only just a little bit that maybe she knew I know the prophet said she knew the the the message or the Bible but still she didn't know it like the fire season yet but yet there was a connection there that she had that germ of life that representation gotten you all he had to do was just blend there one of these days we'll get back to these to the gifts of the ministry and the five-fold ministry how they come predestinated eternally now not the guy see him right you know but the gifts because see that way God sent somebody by to find you never said he sent them by because he knew what it would take to contact you right right all right so you know like brother dick says if if I would have come along to him expounding all of the great things maybe of doing or whatever or you know handling him to death about something then he probably wouldn't accept it would I say it that's right that's the way I was with brother mode if he'd come forward like a lot of people in this message say they introduced the message I wouldn't have never accepted it but when I asked him to put it in the word right so then that gift worked brother Ryan says if you've got a question in your heart he said God's obligated he said he'll put somebody on the platform to answer that question now it may not be a true child I told you about the way that I I learned that we had to get back or I had to get baptized the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I went through a Baptist preacher come in and preach all you do in word indeed do all in the name of Jesus Christ and that's the way I learned it and he wasn't a believer in this match but I've been caught sick hey they come out there praying in Jesus name I come out of their head to the creek you know because I knew what I had to do but see now watch my point God at one time according to acts 17 29 and 30 right through there he said that there was a time that he winked at her ignorance that's right all right down through the times that that they were not you know it was not uh time for the word he would wink at or ignorance about things in other words he we could believe a trinity and still be a Christian there was a time you could be as trinitary and as good and believed in three literal gods and still be a Christian because that was a day in the hour because we were not responsible but now he commands everybody to repent all right so we got to walk in the truth okay so now watch then then the word has to be planted the message then of the prophet of God it took God to you know it took a special person to bring the message that this Prophet brought he brought us the message of God I believe pure and unadulterated and I believe he Vindicated it to be that all right but now you know yourself that there's a lot of places that seemingly the prophet is contrary one to the other in his statements in his doings and you know it seems to be like the well he was over here and he said one thing over here he'd say another and you know that's true all right but see you're taking you you keep studying it and you find out that what he was doing was trying to explain something exactly right right and that was the only way he could explain man right not that he was going this way or going that way he was trying to explain it right and it looked like it was contrary one to the other which it wasn't contrary right I mean it was perfectly what it's supposed to be all right see then now then we come to the bases of seeing one thing I gave it to you there which I'll give it to you many times before but on birth planes right around it was talking about the planning of the word and he said that's why there's not so many new births right genuine ones right not so many of them all right not sure not so many Rudder genuine new births it's because the seed now this is what he says to see this you know it stops in maybe we'll sympathize with the word or the person now what does it mean to sympathize in other words you you go along and listen you you you you sympathize with it but watch what he says but they don't want to rot away from the old system that they were in not to spend all afternoon to doctrines of the people of this message that can be taken exactly back to the denominational periods of time and down through time that those doctrines were there was a Doctrine in the Baptist called two seeds in the spirit and if blinks basically to what would be called the two Soul Doctrine the Mormon doctrine of pre-existent system is a two Soul Doctrine these doctrines are not new I've tried to tell you that these things were before and that's Brother Ray he was listening in the 81. in 2000 he was listening and I was talking then about the River Jordan Doctrine because he's coughing the Tates off now and doing and that was back in the 80s and probably even in the 70s when they were talking about this River Jordan Doctrine these guys didn't come up with something new that doctor's been around a long time we had a Minister's meeting to hear heroin literally about that in probably the 70s you know because it came up dark but you see all these doctrines are not new they're just a new way of explaining it so what do they do sympathize you know in other words get in a little bit but not enough see and they don't want to rot away from the old system that they were in listen they don't want to come out of it they want to stay in their system and claim the new birth are the message of the age I believe this all the time Paul Jones excuse me I know his name is trying to get away from that but when they started that doctrine of the two Souls they my father said one day he said I've waited on this all my life you know please but how many of you sympathize with it damn they're good people and you know they've got that you're just too dogmatic because they're saying the same thing you are well thank you but they'll say you know people that's sympathizing with it right and you sympathize with it you know what you've got your Doctrine right that's right and so these days that's gonna have to be killed in you and that's well that's right he said well I don't know really where the two Soul doctors wrote or not I don't know about it but you know or I I kind of think it might be something to that well now you're sympathizing you're not taking of what I call the the law of just lay it down and say if this is right this can't be right amen right there's either going got to be one God or there's got to be some other form right all right now see it can't be Trinity Oneness or whatever so you just analyze it so that can't be right see you can't have two songs if you got two Souls you got two Gods because if God had to create so right and that's why they say Satan created one God created one Satan can't create so there it goes I've analyze that it can't be okay now I don't care what all the quote sounds like it can't be why because I've used a lot of average on it you said well that ain't supposed to be in the Revelation but okay you'd have to know what I'm talking about anyway but now listen then we've seen that is not the person 154 churches book it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it's the word or seed now so the seed a word you know all right it can be predestinated eternally from God right but the person that's predestinated by four knowledge are you following yes but the seed is part of God and we're not talking about dead letters we're not talking about letters on the page when I talk about the word of God I'm talking about not a letter of a word I'm talking about the revealed word the alive word huh see and that can only be that God would be the word but there is no life outside of that that's right so everything in the world is predestinated what but God's foreknowledge but it's not the person then that comes predestinated it's the seed see then he goes on to express that Jacob alone was seed he said Jacob had the seat that is why he had respect to the birthright and Covenant of God now Jacob was the seed he said well now what's any difference in him and Esau Esau was a better man right but Jacob what she did he have now the only thing I know the difference between Jacob and Esau like I said if you were looking at him you'd pick Esau now what was the difference between Jacob and Esau Esau done everything he could he had to help to daddy he's hunted foreign he brought in me he worked himself to death trying to help his daddy yep you know Jacob was a shyster the only thing you can find good about Jacob is one thing what he had his mind set on that Birthright right right he had his mind on that Birthright he was going to get that birth right it don't make no difference what he had to do now run around says indeed see we know what it types in then it types what the baptism of the Holy Ghost because you were to have your mind set on the baptism of the Holy Ghost it don't matter what you got to do to get it you come get it that ought to be it because that would be your one thought amen all right let's see but Esau he didn't cherish the birthright because to my understanding in it see the birthright would get maybe sometime a double portion maybe out of the thing but still the other one would get something because wasn't that what Esau said beneath to something for me he said yes look what you did look at all this and look at him over there even down you can say Israel got a double portion but look at they're a whole lot smaller than all the things around them but it's dealing with the promise right but see that's the only thing you can say about Jacob did he had his eyes set on the birthright now what would that be then that would be the germ of life but now Jacob never received the new birth right so we got to move further away to be able to understand but that's an example to show it to us all right now so God by foreknowledge he predestinated everything that would ever be in the world foreign that's not calling it a respectful person we'll get to it in a minute where he says even your natural birth it's predestinated of God see then it's not working about whether predestination is right or not he's trying to find out what we understand to be able to guard to predetermine something to be that he could love love Jacob and hate Esau before they were ever born me and we want to make it some kind of a great spiritual thing you know we're gonna make it something that we can just makes us feel good well it makes me feel good to realize the word of God and how God does things all right now but watch now there's not too many new births genuine ones why because the seed is not planted correctly right now how can God give birth to a non-seat now could God give a new birth to a trip to a trinity no it's impossible now there were a lot of trinitarian people as I said God wait to their ignorance they were a lot of sanitary people they got the new birth right amen that's just the street when the Holy Ghost fell there on 1906 was actually trinitarians right the Oneness didn't come to about 1912 somewhere along about dire okay God waited to ignorance but now he commands us to repent I believe the word plant the word word incorrect he planted it perfect all right and then on the dead Pentecost the Holy Ghost could fall on it right right so see you've got to be back here in the end time to once again do what he done that's why I believe the son of man coming back in the end time I believe it I believe he's in the Bride of Jesus Christ right now amen so in the seed of the word right right now he's not in all of this message people no but he's in the bride in the end times showing the seed peering unadulterated right right you said what brother Dale I thought when we got on over there you know there wouldn't be too many being saved well where'd you get the idea you've got a denominational concept I'm in oh my right come running around City didn't know how many to be saved in that life's moment two Rapture the church we don't want that quote but I just don't see there's no way people are harder can be saved anymore well you know you wouldn't the doctor said that about 20 years ago when you wasn't saved right right you see you find out you know why would anybody get that Concept in the mind why would it have it the Baptist that they wouldn't have a Revival because it afraid somebody might get saved that didn't want to be that God didn't want to say now that's a doctrine of the Baptist Church what are you seeing this message people I think it's about over don't you I just don't see no more people getting saved I think it's over yeah well what about your kids I'm gonna put your grandkids oh it's great grandkids it's all right if you're in isn't it I can't help it to probably say it I didn't say that I would think we're different he hadn't made that statement they look like it's over but he said I don't know how many be saved in the last moment two raps for the church well you know it might be that we've got to get this word planted peering under death before they could be any Birth come on Amen all right that's what I'm trying to do well brother damn we all claim to how to give birth well claiming to have it and it really happened it two different things you make a lot of claims but you see the new birth won't deny the word said God leads his word we want his children believe it well you're just not popular who's worried about popularity amen all right I'm worried about preaching the gospel to you somebody else listen that's fine I'm preaching the gospel the one I try to believe all right all right but now we read it there and we read it over and over in Ephesians that we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world well now if if that's sensible wording you know then it means one thing if we were chosen in him some way we've got to have the understanding that we had to be in him amen because of him we were chosen of him but we take the words to be then that would make him being a respecter and not fulfilling his whole plan I ordered me later on there's another couple of messages down the road but I quoted this morning right around said it was in him to be a father amen that's right see we think that's happened something happened on down the road after he'd existed it was in him to be a Healer your your mind is still locked on the fact that we had to be sickness it had to be a loss in them get it unlocked all right get it to the bases of seeing what it's really saying if it was in him to be a father you know what it meant he was a father right right you know it was in me to be a father the day I was born right that's right but it took 20 years and a wife to display that but it didn't matter it was already in there that's right so if we were chosen in him that meant we had to be in him and we're going back further into predestination then what our thoughts had been on we've been dealing with foreknowledge as dealing with what happened in life you know no I'm not going to get on it but I will when I get time that where it says the morning starts saying together the sons of God shouted for joy now that had to be in God some were amen and that was before the lamb was slain the because brother Robin said they saw the Plan of Redemption and he used his Revelations 13 8. do you say brother now do you mean that do you believe there was something back there well everybody else does but what if they believe was Factor all right they said run around them where we Spirits back there he says no you wasn't nothing I he was only in his mind that's what we're going to be dealing with me but it turned out to be the greatest mystery of all the mystery how that we were in him now that's what Jesus said what was it in you you and you and me now it's easy to see I understand or try to comprehend I in you we can say that's the new birth he's in US but said you and me the vast difference between the two statements that Jesus made them write together and you must have believed it right right because that's what he said all right now see then we've got to go back to find out how were we in him when we cannot put ourselves back there as people because that would bring pre-existence and we certainly know that this it would have a problem in your mental capacity of your mind to try to think that your body existed because he's now getting older all right hey but now listen we talk about eternity we say eternity has no beginning and has no end so now here's where the preachers need to listen a little bit maybe and hold on to it especially that because they're the ones trying to explain it if you can't preach predestination if Kate preachs eternity let me put it that away if you can't preach eternal and it's going just as far that away and never stopped him because if your thoughts ever stop it's not eternal right amen but at the same time you must be able to preach it back that away because if not you're going to have a starting point in coin right okay everybody with me yeah Joy fish eternal it had no beginning and have no ending so then you got to be able to go as far that away but you got to be able to go as far that way and it's not that they got to come and turn around and meet each other that's what I said about eternity as we say it's like a circle that's just our expression right no eternity means it's going that way eternally and it means it come from there eternally right it's not a circle to connect back make it that's what we make it sound like make it a mutant all right now I'm gonna just say this much now a priests and just got through with the series preaching and I preached it people believe that all God was he poured into Christ and all Christ supporting the church and take her back to the Garden of Eden all right that's that's good I wonder if we believe that but if you notice that as I was bringing it I didn't stop anywhere I preached it all the way into eternity that there is a message of cure the prophet said to be given to us in the Eternal ages to come you remember that see then I didn't stop I didn't preach it up to the Future home and stopped I didn't preach it to the Millennium and stop or whatever I preached it to the basis of showing you and what I believe that if God is eternal then they'll they'll be an eternal partaking of the Living God after this world is over we just come here to get enough understanding to get enough God in us to be able to understand what that God is amen when I got through that message I didn't stop it's still going all right go to these eternal how can you exhaust an eternal word right so you can watch our problem is we say Eternal Word but you know what our brain says and you know what our conscious inside of us says we're we're stop stop stop that's what I say that's that's our mind our brain stopped us from thinking about the word can be eternal book but in Eternal Word when we're 10 million trillion zillions or whatever you can say into eternity will still be receiving the Revelation that's right amen of almighty God it didn't stop now I was hoping somebody to bring that up to me one day now if we can't go back that way and keep on going back that way in the correct way then we just looking forward you're not taking the word eternal right that's why your Prophet would emphasize we don't believe in eternal sonship you see because sometimes have a beginning so we covered it what that one day the sun will be utter subjection to the father that God may be all in all hey not done away with we'll still see Jesus and realizing with almighty God but if we can't go back that away with it now see that what we're saying out there is just non-seed if I can't go and until the Holy Ghost if the Holy Ghost can't bring it through me to where we can go back there then there was something wrong with my going that away now that's eternal you see why that there's not too many New Birth genuine ones because the preachers can't go that away and go that way because their thoughts I'll go so far and they'll just make a circle and come right back in time to the bottom and we'll just make this circle over and over and over no no no no no no no no no no no that's just an example it just means it has no beginning and no end that's an example the real truth is it's got to keep going even science says this universe is moving yeah they say ever since the Big Bang Theory where it come from the one great big ball that is eternal it's just moving the whole at the whole world everything all the planets and everything we're moving why because it's proven God man are you listening please if you talk about eternity you've got to be able to go far that way and you can go that way right all right can you go back that way how far can you go how far backward can you go brother Brandon said in the beginning before the eternal now explain that one when eternity had no beginning how could he make such a statement in the beginning but before the eternal he's just trying his best to express the in the beginning is where we can mentally go back to yeah whether it be the creation of the world whether it be Angels whatever it be that that is the beginning but before the Eternal Eternal God existed the prophet said I'm coming here I know ain't gonna get to read them but if you've got eternal life you always was eternal that's right but that's the question if you had it right there's a title to the message this is predestination number eight do put the title to it do you have it now a question run around them you'll see every time he uses the word if you have it now if is a question right it's not a fact a statement it's a question right it means something is uh cannot be stated you know go to this ill if You Love Me Jesus said he'll keep my Commandments see a lot of ifs in the Bible because it means that there is a questionable thing involved if you love me the question is do you love me right do you love me if you love me do you love me all right now but see we we just put it where we want to put things and then we just talk about what we'll write this reading what it says here you know I always was eternal well what if the prophet in the same message says if you have eternal life let's read a little bit you get number three on your notes which is taking surge we would see Jesus 1964 318. like in the beginning God was not even God he was the great eternal and even Dyer was attributes he said attributes was his thoughts on now what is his attributes there's three attributes of God now we did I've told him explained it before so that's what I'm trying to say again there's only three attributes so God father son the Holy Ghost all right now you see now this here all of those are in focus on and Holy Ghost are you listening now all the attributes of God is good is developed or come from or in the the basis of Father Son and Holy Ghost is that sensible yes yes that's the only attributes they are now here A Savior except has to dwell within Father Son and Holy Ghost all right now then was there ever a time that he was your father and then he becomes son and then you become the Holy Ghost now that's predator and it's all get out we'll read and run around and said they would go out alone with his attributes that's why I was saying there a moment ago if he ever was a father then that was his attribute so do you know what it meant for him to be a father you know what it means what what makes us your father we're not talking about the Catholic church now called the father or some preacher you know his father so and so no we're not talking about that what makes a father that's all friends I still Fellaini brother that's the Deep that's a simple so then they our word for God goes back to self-existing then there was a time that he existed with himself but then was there ever a Time existed without his attributes if you do it you're going to start him changing doing things we're going to see what eternity is like I said but the message I preached and believe what I see I'm still going that away because I'm not limited God nowhere and I can see down through the endless Eternal ages that his word will just keep unfolding and folding and unfolding now let's go back that away and see if we can go back far enough until in our our thinking we'll see that there never was a time that he didn't exist and if there never was a time God didn't exist then there's never been a time that his offspring didn't exist Ence or you're gonna have to say he developed something along the way right all right you know you're going to find out what it means I always was eternal because if you have eternal life how many quotes is there if you have eternal life that eternal life always was eternal all right so let's see what your Prophet had to say it was the Eternal God in endurance attributes attributes was installed and then it become a word like this and a word expressed well a thought expressed as a word the word express is a thought and then remember if you ever was in God's thinking you'll always be there once if you've got eternal life Marcel right right if you've got eternal life you are the expression or the attribute of this thought for this age if not you there's only one eternal life and it always existed and you and his mind existed before there was a world that's the reason he said he chose you before the foundation of the world it isn't what we think what somebody else thinks is what God Eternal you always was see in his thinking it was in him to be man now when did that develop ment sure later on right but it would always end him right sure that's the reason that Christ was the expressed image see so where were we if he was if you ever was in God's thinking you'll always be there right if you ever was now why is he saying that because the if it's left up to you and I remember I said a lot of times I said well now um you know I say this because it's left up to you to think about it if God is real if there is a God that doesn't mean I doubt that God is real that doesn't mean I doubt there's a God I say it I said I I leaning back to you that's to you if you think if you think there is a God why can't you think that God can never have another thought these thoughts got to be perfect and pure and eternal amen see we put our little ifs in there I think wouldn't that what happened to even the garden right do you know no right even funny that's what messed her up well that's when that he's down the right hand he was not throwing off on women look at him proving his word 1964 age 16. okay now our stood priests there said this man's Bell's above see no representation eternal life you always was see you have eternal life there's only one form of it that's God you were his attribute he thought of you and no Jew before the foundation of the world in his mind he goes on to explain that those priests had all the representation on Earth but they had no representation in heaven wasn't in God's thinking at all but he said this little woman that said I believe you're a prophet in other words all right now let's clear up something people say it but brother Dale I believe I was a thought in God's mind I conned the phrase I hope it sticks with you I don't want to be a thought in God's mind because he thought of Judas his character he thought of every person by his foreknowledge that would ever be in the world and now they would be lost to be part of the Thinker you remember that that's anchor right well you're just getting in the war what's the matter can't you see that a thought that God would have could be Destiny a part of Earth to be the point of seeing everything but to be part of his thinking right yeah amen would be entirely different right Judas is scary was right there in the thoughts of God but he was not eternal he proved it because he didn't receive eternal life right but now listen now God's thoughts are eternal okay so once he thought of Judas me and Judas he could never change see we we don't look at those things in the correct order his thought of you and I could be Eternal but that don't give us eternal life but if we're a part of God we always was eternal now we're going to take a lot of reading I wasn't going to do but just a little bit but finally decided if you'll notice number five goes on on to them IRS and it keeps on rolling okay that means this is a continuation of reading right out of the church age book all right so let's just read the people can read you something and say you believe that the prophet said I can read to you that Judas went hung himself and you go do likewise you believe that no you know why because the before and after explains it right you remember come on board pay your board because I'm bored with you the way you explaining something gives you the answer all right but if you continually read at least one thing about it you got to admit the prophet said but you know how it is what have you done a lot of times you went up and talked to people and you say the Bible says and you're holding it in your hand the Bible says wrong for a woman to cut her hair what do they say what's the statement back to you I don't believe that I know I don't believe that what do you mean you don't believe it it's right there I don't believe what you're saying I didn't say it that's right yeah that's your interpretation I let you read it right what'd you see we're so spiritual we think until we can correct almighty God now that's really doing something in it so let's just start reading and just follow with me and I'll try to quit here in a few minutes because I know I can't get to all I've got written name all right this is Page 149 which is the church age book it's submarine Church age but it's in the church age book this will be 149 it'll be reading through 150 and then to 152. all right watch carefully now and see this before there was ever a speck of Stardust before God was God in this good point God is an object of adoration and no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only potentially God and he was known only as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God they are Eternal are they not I see now don't go back to her I'm warning you ahead of time and make yourself little bitty people running around that's right amen any form you want to make please whatever then you you got problems right anything you want to make do you're going to try to figure it out don't try to figure it out listen to The Prophet explain it the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are that's also God eternal if you can see this you will see many things God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his ability so therefore he as God must be omniscient if he is omniscient then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he is not not omniscient the best you could say is that sometime he will be but that is not scriptural he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he's God the thoughts of God are eternal they are real now listen to him they are not they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has grown up which one day will be translated into substance and form but they're already real and eternal and part of God do we draw the blueprint we make some we draw it up what we want to look like he didn't do that see how this works God always had his thoughts for Adam has his thoughts was yet unexpressed Psalms 139 15 16 will give you a little idea of this now keep in mind his thoughts was unexpressed so when he says down here that I said I didn't say this to him about Adam because it's going to be bringing it down to a deeper meaning okay so hold on man read with me Psalms see 130 out of 15 16. we'll give you a nice little idea of this so it's going to give you an idea of Eternity what it is or an eternal thought my substance was not hidden from thee when I was made in secret and curiously brought in the lower parts of the earth and that was talking of Jesus Christ all right and then talking of mankind okay or the bride all right then as you see my substance yet being unperfect and in that book were all my members written which in continuous see one after the other what's fashion one is yet there was none of them then as I said was not written about Adam they've become animals on Express now this wasn't written about Adam it's written about him and written about you and I but it gives you the idea and knowledge that the thought that was there in his mind and that thought was eternal and had to be expressed so when Adam was formed of the Dust of the Earth and his spiritual being created by God then Adam became God's thought expressed in those Eternal thoughts were now manifested in other words he came on Earth down through the centuries we go we find a Moses a Jeremiah but John the Baptist notice all of these are Old Testament right he's one of these were God's Eternal thought expressed in its season then we come to Jesus the Lord gods he was the perfect and complete talk expressed and he became known as the word that's what he is and forever will be that says that he had chosen Us in him Jesus before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from it and what let me just inject the thought in here even our natural birth is based upon election the female ovaries right pronounce that word produce men produce many many eggs but why is it that at a certain time a certain egg comes down and not another one and then amongst the male sperm for no known reason a certain germ attaches itself to the egg While others that could have just as easily attached themselves or had a better opportunity to do so do so did not do so and perished there is an intelligence behind all intelligence behind all this otherwise what determines whether the baby is a boy a girl blonde or brunette lighter brown Lighter dark type of eyes are so forth with these thoughts in mind think about Joshua and Caleb did not Jesus say in John 6. 49. your fathers did eat Manna in the wilderness and are dead no whatever else did that means they don't think we've talked to were eternally dead those parents that died were necessary as the forefathers of the people of whom Jesus was speaking in other words they had to be back there to where these people could stand before Jesus and he said and your father take man in the wilderness and they're dead and you're dead too in other words they perished it they were in the election of God naturally as Joshua and Taylor were spiritually but go on these elect were not only the Eternal thoughts of God which were to be a physician but these same electors called by another name Romans 4 16. therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that which oh wait not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all Romans 9 17-13 neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called now I just got through preaching on the Isaac the seed and the right okay that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son not only this but when that Rebecca had also conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not in works but of him that call it it was said unto her that Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but he saw how I hated Galatians 3 16. now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as Genesis I'm in Galatians 3 16. he said not and to seeds as a many but as of one and of thy seed which is Christ Galatians 3 29. and if you be Christ then you're Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise according to Romans 4 16 we find that God has given a sure promise to all of Abraham's seed and Paul puts himself in all believers under that designation because he said Abraham who is the father of us all then he goes on to not only narrow down his definition but rather to finalize it in Galatians 3 he identified deceit singular with Jesus and counted to see children as children of promise and promise of having to do with election are the children of God and that is exactly what we have been saying these are the Royal Sea these these who are of the royal seed are the elect of God or the predestinated foreknown of God and we're in the mind of God in his thoughts in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally do not expressed until each came forth in the designated decree season in his age each member came forth it became expressed it took his place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed spoken word see bright and though she is feminine designations she's also called the body of Christ it is very apparently show to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same source are you reading was eternal with him and is now massifesting God in a many members body whereas once God was manifested now that's cut off on yours but it says in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ if that was cut off the bottom of the earth so now I can't get far enough to get into it but what I want we will go and read one more number six on your note then we're coming to a conclusion as the eternal logos God with manifested in the Sun and in Jesus all dwell all the well all the fullness of the godhead bodily and then Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title son of son even so we Eternal in his talks in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed as a reason we could be quickened in none seed there is nothing to Quicken no you have a lot of in there and I will make this on it and it's on the computer for them to do it you read all of them things by Wednesday and we'll pick up that talk and carry on but read all of these thoughts where brother Branham and I gave you where he said my future home people say uh Eternal into the kingdom of God with eternal life of the predestinated Endeavor didn't start never started on any day you wasn't saved on any day you was always saved I believe that 100 but you better read on because you see you will find in your quote another quote out of the future home that says if you have eternal life you always was eternal out of the same message that tells you you always was eternal there's a lot of quotes going through that so I can't cover it all right we'll be here late this afternoon but you read them over and over and we'll put it on a little bit in this coming Wednesday we'll start right there if you have eternal life you always was eternal but you as a person you know not you as what we're looking at right but if you have eternal life how could you have eternal life didn't have a beginning or have an indie right if you have eternal life the eternal life that you have always was eternal example but brother Dale I just believe that quote I run around and said I always was eternal well all right that you see to those that want to know the truth they keep on reading and you see that he said if you have eternal life you always was eternal and you'll find in our one in the future home is where I just read from the Futurama so is your Prophet that confused did he teach that we don't have to be born again no no that was his if that was his stressing the point we had to Bear born again we have to receive eternal life if we receive eternal life then the eternal life never had no beginning we could never have an end right simple but do we believe it that way or we got some preconceived idea or thought that we come into the world with eternal life if you did then Jesus Christ didn't have to die you stay with brother Dale all he died I'll cover it he said you'd say well brother Dale all it is is the the new birth and things are just an anointing it would come on us hmm to let us know well according to the prophet that anointing left him in a Garden of Gethsemane manifested Sons 1960. the anointing left him in the Garden of Gethsemane and then where's your new birth from you see there's some things are in the sea of the church age group we're going to get down and read because I've had these red in my face until it's just you know sometimes you actually don't want to read some of the quotes because they've been read from wrong brother random says in there and everybody lays up on that you know he said an eagle can go a long time before it realizes sneaker you made that statement but you know and don't consider one thing that eagle that was born in the chicken yard wasn't a chicken didn't even look like a chicken you didn't act like a chicken he born an eagle when you're born again that makes you a child of God right he was born to me go by his new birth but then one day he realized that he wasn't a chicken because all that time he thought he was we used to have no rabbit that rabbit is running around through the yard great big old sucker he'd run around through the yard and then we'll rabbit dogs would just run right around through that with him and barking you know he'd just run around through that he thought his rat a dog you look and he was so big but them old rabbit dogs wouldn't move food with him and Freight has he but someday I don't remember exactly what happened but I guess it was a big old bony Hound probably took care of the rabbit I don't remember what happened because that's gone but I imagine that old bony Hound let the rabbit realize that he was a rabbit and he wasn't no dog and he got him a meal you know what you understand what I'm saying us Eagles a lot of you claimed the baptism of the Holy Ghost before you ever come in the message even and I don't argue that I believe it until my experience that I didn't do that but I believe yours you tell me you got the new birth somewhere well you know what you were sitting out trying to them denominations thanking you as bad just just thinking his Methodist and Presbyterians just having yourself a good time you know and going over and everything else you'd never do you need to know where the ego was you know what a Christian was did you come on be honest you thought a Christian massage good and going to church and being nice and you know and doing everything nice and sure enough we know that's part of it but watch a Christian born-again experience oh that was wonderful but that was good things let's see one day you realize that you were no Presbyterian you wouldn't know me after this you were no bad this you wouldn't know chicken you come to a realization now I'm gonna say it and because I'll come back to this see this message should bring you and I to a realization that they ain't no chicken you'll take his message because it'll be like the lady said you know did he call me a buzzard you know Tommy brother Ryan's message this other sister said but he called me an eagle you got to be an eagle to have Eagle food so the things people use to try to prove a point they they don't prove anything they prove sometimes how dumb we are to want to use them but that eagle was born to an eagle he wasn't born to chicken and then become an eagle and it took him a long time to find out he was an eagle this took you and a long time to find out we're Eagles we're not chickens and like I've always told you that old Eagle was down in the barnyard right one day if Mama come along screaming he jumped upon the post we know the story of any sword in the sky right and he soared around as an eagle and he realized he was an eagle I know you don't like the rest of my story but it's all right it's true you have to agree because see one day that illegal he realized he's an equal you know what he does him and mama and daddy is flying over the chicken yard and all at once all his brothers and sisters and his mama and what he thought was his mom and daddy you know all at once they look like a good Kentucky Fried Chicken meal and they'd better run from the old boy because he's not a chicken he's open to all he loved his mama see you don't understand it that eagle we need to become an eagle then chickens better run but because that was his nature it wouldn't be that he remembered how good his mother was need to remember how good an old-fashioned meal is I'm just carnal I know but you think about it run around never made that illustration I didn't say he did I said I did but is it true is it true let's Stand Together go ahead and get one of you come ahead anyway we come down to the communion part forgive me for Joe Henry if I could it's not a place to joke but I don't mean it's a joke I mean it's the truth and you really find out you're an eagle you're not going to go out there and try to sail over and destroy all these things no no we would try to hip everybody do anything we could to help any denominational person they call in one prayer we pray for them right we pray this is sincerely it's just making a point but there's got to be a day you and I going to find out we're equals and we're not going to be scratching in the chicken yard them two Soul doctrines and seven Thunder virtues and River Jordan doctrines they become worms and we don't want him we want a fresh kill that will keep going that way and never stop it'll also go back that way and never find a beginning if I can preach anything whatsoever to you is what I'm trying to bring is to get you to see God never had a beginning and if you have eternal life the eternal life you have never had a beginning but you've got to receive it to have it just as Jesus I've Illustrated over and over right Jesus stood as a lands flying before the foundation worked right but now what if he'd never come to Calvary 2000 years ago it would have meant that was false prophecy it would have been saying something that wasn't true he had to come to that place there was a day you and I was lost and doomed and on our way to hell right we had to accept eternal life we had to accept the pardon to be set free but once we accepted it we find out we just as Eternal as he is right find out with that eternal life that I have never had no beginning right that's a wonderful kind amen for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed to bread and when he had given thanks he break even and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doing remembrance of me after this same manner also after this same manner also he took the cup when he accepted saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this due as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shoot the Lord's death till he cometh wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and show let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup so he didn't eat it then drinketh unworthily eateth and drink of damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause meant or this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world we're for my brethren when you come together to eat carry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest will I said in order when I come so let's just have a few moments of solid prayer just pray in one for another remember these that are sick among us I think and just pray that God will make manifest his word in the healings of the bodies and the Deliverance of the souls and set us all free in him all right thank you thank you Father for your word your word is true we ask you now that you would just come and just be with us as we go into the communion Lord remember those that are sick among us because you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction we know Sister Thomas our Lord their blood pressure is just line up 200 and all like that Lord and it's a dangerous thing we plead the blood of our Lord and savior over her Lord at this time and believing that you'll take care of everything make all well we thank you and we just commit everything into your hands now forgive our sins and lead us by that understanding and guide us in Jesus name amen the Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you that this bread Lord has went through the part of being cooked and made to word that can be consumed into the human body and we believe we believe you've done that you went through a life you paid a price and you became that bread of life that word Lord and may our thoughts be solely upon Thy Word that you were the word and Lord and we pray that you would just in making our understanding be there and we'd see this is not your body this is only in representation that your body is really the word but we eat upon these natural things as an example so we ask you to just bless each one that pertains sanctify the bread and the partakers in the name of Jesus Christ thousands of years mankind has been through these things and what confusion has come out of it some people in the message even don't take the communion because they say the Lord's already come you know some believe it and they would life it the ones who believe that it is the literal body in the blood of the Lord but what would be the difference in your thoughts well why would it be any different What would why can't we just see what it is it represents and in representation then we can believe the truth thank God for the truth right father we thank you for this wine this went through the process and gets better each day we ask you now that you would sanctify the wine it represents your blood and Lord as we eat the little piece of bread and then as we drink this little little bit of wine that tomorrow it'll be blood cells in our body for us to live by and we thank you you died to pay the price now sanctify us the protakers that we may all be won together in
