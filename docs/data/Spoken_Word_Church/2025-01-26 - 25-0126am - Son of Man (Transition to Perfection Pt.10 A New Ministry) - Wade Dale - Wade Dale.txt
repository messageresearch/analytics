be our attitude every service brother brandom said come expecting come here knowing you will not be denied refusing to be denied amen expecting the word let's change the order of service oh brother brother brother boy you have something can I say something sure I don't mean be out of order that's right it's okay if you get pent Pentecost on me amen hey I I'm out of order here because I didn't tell anybody I want to do this but the Lord just put it on my heart I want to give a thank everybody for the prayers the food and uh visitations the hospital and everything that everybody's done uh it was kind of a shock to me what took place but I had to I'm going to tell you something I've never told anybody except Janet I just told her this last year that I'd had for a long time I had a dream that I was being cut open and I would have a death moan and it was horrible and it would wake her up and scare her and I say that because of the things that uh have taken place but and I turned as I was leading singing over the last couple months when I get through a service I would turn to Donnie and Esther and I'd say the Lord has given me the scripture in a little while you'll see me no more and I would say that for weeks because I'd get to about third song and I couldn't even breathe I'd be totally out of breath and uh I've had three physicals and the doctors would tell me you're in perfect shape for your age uh you know I had set goals in my life I wanted to get to three score 10 man that was close but I made it praise the Lord uh but I had uh I set goes my life and I want to encourage all the young people to set a goal and meet it I met everyone I set praise the Lord when I retired at 62 that was my goal and that was my major accomplishment but I just want to touch on a couple things they kept telling me uh I said I want this calcium test I said you don't need it you're in perfect shape I've had three physicals and said you're in great shape and I they I kept talking to them they said well it's going to cost you $90 and I said I don't care I want it so I go in there and get the test and the score comes back at 13 1438 on uh on my calcium which is supposed to be less than 300 and uh so they sent me in for a hard Cath and was going to do a uh check me out for a hard Cath and see what kind of problems I had and I had what they found out I had 23 blockages and uh so that was uh on a Wednesday they come back said Amazon don't have enough stin I can buy in a package to do this on you you're going to have to go home we're going to have to do a bypass so when they got in there to they did some more testing and they realized that I needed five bypasses uh I had one and I have a a picture of this at some point but I had uh 90% blockages and about the rest of them were 70 70% blockages so they decide they need to bypass well I just happened to be the third person in 40 years the doctor seem to stirred them like I have so when they went to do the bypasses they couldn't get to the back one so one of them they ended up doing four uh because I have a high race sternum and the kids used to kid me about they could eat cereal off my chest uh because of the way my chest was risen but uh but they said I was a third state person that 30 years they seen with that type of chest cavity so we go and have the surgery everything's great brother Tony he was with me always brother Wade God bless every day i' I go to sleep I'd wake up Tony still be S God bless I'd go to sleep come back he's still there but I just want to tell you the prayers of the Saints is what got me through so we had the surgery they did four bypasses I had a lung collapse during surgery when I come out I had a little bit of difficulty didn't know what was going on and they don't tell you nothing right after surgery you learned a lot of stuff till three days later which I don't think is right but they did that and then after a few days and one thing you don't do when you come out of heart surgery is uh the TV being on and watching Star Trek where they're zapping everybody I mean you just don't do that and that happened to be on the TV when I come back in the room but uh after two or three days I I got to work and only say one word because my chest cavity was filling up with fluid and they decided that the I forget what they call that but they had to put me in the take me down and put a tube in my back and it drained my back of that fluid and it actually sounded like a bathtub water running it was incredible and it was bad but after that everything's been great but uh he told me he said because I didn't have a heart attack that I my heart's going to recover just I'm doing better than they really expected and uh I'm just so grateful for everybody's prayers but I've been in rehab four weeks now and they have a MET score which means your oxygen concentration to your heart rate based on your activities and they wanted me to hit uh seven and I hit that Friday already cuz I'm pushing the doctor said he give me 25 more years I said he gave me he gave it to me so my new my new uh my new goal is four score four amen I'll take that one but uh I've never had fear about laying down and rising up from surgery never had any fear because I know the Lord is over when my dad was on machines I had take him off him if it was his the Lord's will to bring him up he would have brought him up but it wasn't because that was my faith not his faith and brother dick and I used to always talk about whose Faith Is It Anyway way it's the faith of God you got to have my faith might encourage you but it's the faith of God that's going to get you through these things so and just let me close real quick here and just say that uh I just believe that uh when he laid me down he'll raise me up and I'm going to believe that to that one more time he's going to do it that one more time it says right but with that said I just appreciate every one of you appreciate the food again and uh thoughts and prayer and apologize by being L of getting that out to you but I just thank every one of you and love every one of you amen praise be to God amen amen amen let's bring

of a new ministry which was a transition between we're going from transition to Perfection he was going from that church Age part he was going from the partial to perfect realization all right and the

do away with him but we know one greater we have have a great physician let's go to him in prayer father Lord you know our heart's heavy for brother Joe Lord and brother Nathaniel and and Lord each

there Lord our our new great niece Lord s sister Emerson Dean Dale we sure appreciate you giving her a life and being with our sister Anna during that time father I pray that you'd bless each one now forgive us of our sins Jesus name we pray and the saint said amen all right let's read 1 Corinthians 2:9 but as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for who for them that love him so there's only a special group of people that's going to understand God know what he said and be happy and only one group of people that's right for those of whom that love him not not FOH him agap him in other words have the new birth but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yay the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of the man which is in him as we said before we live in a spiritual being we we live in a spiritual being we have human we have human skin but we have a spiritual life because even even our thoughts even the things that we do at things that are that are that are um you know we do in like memory reason conscious affection imagination that is a spirit realm all right but we're talking about the soul now God's talking here Paul is telling us he said now there's a natural man that understands the natural life we do all right but then now watch even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God all right so it's a special group of people as brother R said a special class of people now listen we're not to separate ourself let God separate us your actions will separate yourself your actions will immediately separate yourself from the world now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given look freely given to us of God you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading the word the door is open go in and get what you need it's not closed anymore it's not we're not wandering around and wondering if this is right and wondering if that is right we know what's right we know truth you should know today that this is truth what you're what you're sitting in today not your natural seat not this natural building not hearing my natural voice but this message of the hour is so dear to each one of us it's part of our being it's our language as we were talking about brother Dutch and I we we had our a little get together Friday night over some dinner and we are the only people that understand why God came why he came to a special group of people why he had to send us a prophet to straighten everything out as we were talking about Wednesday night he had to restore the original Doctrine back to the church the original doct he didn't bring a different Doctrine He restored the original doctrine that was in the first two or three Church ages before man got a hold of it and what they diluted it and we'll read you a quote here in just a minute so what happened was is listen you can't dilute the word of God but man through man's filter dilutes the word of God the the word of God's always been powerful the word of God is not like a graph right it's straight is eternal we just got to attach oursel to the right piece because you know some people are preaching today that the word of God is a trinity that the word of God is father son Holy Ghost baptism don't believe what we believe s in this building contrary to what we believe and they say that's the word of God so how are we going to know the difference we're going to know the difference by the spirit that's inside of us I tell you one more time and I'll tell you another time if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul you can never ever turn this message down you cannot do that because the Holy Ghost the token for this hour is the message of the hour and we don't get in it we're out of it you be all right with that this is it Coke for years said this is it well Coke ain't it Coca-Cola is all right to drink but this is it this is what God purposed this is what God put us on the earth for he put us in the right time the right place and even the right mentality to hear from God because down through the church ages somebody has stood behind the pull pit and told them lies sorry anything false from the word of God is a liar and it ain't true right I'm sorry you said oh what about Luther and Wesley they had their time that they preached false Doctrine but they had their time that they told us and showed us that to just shall live by faith absolutely and then when God moved man stayed still we just went through the church ages when when God moved Lutheran Stood Still Wesley Stood Still They had a time but now you and I this transition to perfection even comes from we're not looking at 1963 anymore we're not looking at 196 anymore we're in 2025 never would we have thought 20 years ago that's right that we would have to buy a calendar that said 2025 and that I would have a Medicare card in my pocket what' I just say so let's let's turn to Matthew 13 the reason I'm I'm approaching it like this is I know for a fact there's some people that struggle with deep teaching now deep teaching is just something that we say not to scare you I just read you that you love the Deep things of God brother B said we love what is revelation Revelation is the Deep things of God okay and we'll read that in just a little while the doctrine that you live by is actually permeated in your being the doctrine you live by is what you work by it's what you play by come on it's what you have your everyday life by it's all connected to the word of God if you're born again if you're not born again praise God you're in if you're in your journey that's fine just remember there is a time when God will not wink at your ignorance he won't wink at my ignorance he call every person to repent and come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost am that's why many times we and me and another brother we're talking the other day the time and and this is true listen the time of us preaching that you need to come to church ever service is over if you don't know it by now if you don't know you need to be here when that door opens that's your problem that's the truth and you can make 50,000 excuses if you want to you're not making them to me you're not making them to congregation you making them to God everybody with me all right I just believe that God said he'd meet us here and this is where I need to be right here regardless don't start giving excuses you give them to God don't give them to me give them to God right why you can't get to church but a holy ghost filled person will come to church you don't have to teach that anymore you don't have to teach a woman that's filled with the Holy Ghost that she don't need to cut her hair so that's where we're getting to where Paul is saying leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection you can't sit here every service and sisters come in every service now I'm talking about I'm talking about new people you know I don't I'm not talking about new people if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost today and you just come into the message of the hour and your hairs are short as mine your hair is as long as a sister sitting beside you you just got to prove it by letting it continue to grow everybody with me on that all right so let's just be as brother Bob was talking about let's don't be too quick to judge last Sunday was teaching on that which is very good let's don't be so quick but you've got to come to a time to where if you've been here for 6 months8 months or a year or even 15 20 years in this message y'all not be told you need to come to church yall not be told you don't need to wear pants yall not be told these things why because we got to go on to Perfection and Perfection is what laying aside all the other things and remember we'll get into it in just a minute Paul wasn't saying do away with everything you can't do away with the word of God you can't do away with the foundation of this building this building it doesn't matter if we tear it down the foundation will still be here there's a foundation that we live on which is Doctrine and that Doctrine moves that Doctrine moves God doesn't stay still God moves man stays still all right now Matthew 13:5 now this is the soore the seed the seed's the word of God the soar is the son of man so we're talking about a preacher preaching to you and what taking the word of God and throwing the seed out today I'm planting seed today there's seed being planted you've got to realize where to put it some fell upon Stony places watch some of that seed some of that word which they had not much Earth in other words you let your body override your mind oh you I'm sorry I'm preaching to somebody else I'm I'm preaching to myself today cuz I'll let that happen a good bit okay and forth with they sprang up we started coming to church we started being happy with the message of the hour this is the greatest thing since sliced bread why do we always say slic bread it's the greatest thing since gasoline it's just wonderful we've had many people come through this church I don't many few s on the front row no offense sat on the front row clap praise God rais their hands say this ain't nothing but the truth shouted 6 months later they're in a Baptist Church so what did they have they got a feeling they got an anointing of the word of God that's right there was a seed planted was there was a seed planted but they had no deepness of Earth in other they didn't let it sink all the way into their soul cuz I'll say it one more time you can't be influenced by the message of the hour have the new birth and turn it down you can't do that you might be foolish virgin you might think you're saved you're not sorry it's black and white No Gray and go no gray that's why the new birth brother rown said was the most important thing you could have not that you could read a message book faster than somebody else not that you can listen to more tapes than somebody else it's what you do with what you got so the preacher's preaching he's sewing a seed and there's somebody sitting there in the congregation they're enjoying it they're soaking up the the you know the atmosphere of God but they got to walk out that door and go out in the world you and I same thing if we have to work we got to go right out the door tomorrow and go to work and when the sun was up hot trials tribulations when the sun was up they were scorched what that tender plant that had been planted and because they had no root they withered away brother Luis is not here today but he'll tell you when he first started coming to church here about 10 or 12 years ago may have been longer than that he came from another church and came here and sat down and you know he'd already heard that that dad was a good teacher and and you had to listen you had to pay attention you had to pay attention to that cuz he was a good teacher best one I've ever heard in the message of the hour ever zero Barone amen but you got to sit and listen if you listen to two or three sermons and you say I don't know I I just can't and leave then I brother Lise said I stayed I stayed and I prayed he said about 6 months later he got to where I he said I got to where I could understand what your dad was saying he had the Holy Ghost that's what it was that was the key if the Holy Ghost you just let the Holy Ghost work in your life he'll tell you something he can't deny the word of God and as deep as you want to go in the word of God he's got to he's got to already be there to give it to you right and he knew you would come to him it or not because they had no deepness of Earth and when the sun was up there were Scorch Trials tribulations somebody questioning their uh this brandom man right had a pastor called me two nights ago he said I had a man raised up in my church while I was preaching and denied the message denied what he was preaching and it troubled the brother it would trouble me too and he didn't tell me who it was I don't care but he said it was really close to him but it wasn't his wife he said he said he just he stood up and said a c didn't just stand up he said a couple of words brother oh I almost said his name brother was preaching and the brother said no that ain't right listen and you know what it was are you ready are you ready for this great bombshell okay I'm going to say it slow so they can interpret so brother thank God for brother brother Manuel back there interpreting thank God God sent him here [Applause] and his family to help us out to help our my whole prayer was to help the people that's coming now the Hispanic people the ones that need to hear the word of God in their language and I'm sorry I can't speak it I can barely speak this one but you know what the brother had a problem with one quote brother Brown says I wouldn't have a Cadillac if somebody gave me one it's a quote somewhere I don't know I don't care about these things but he said brother brandham was given a Cadillac in 1963 or he had the date that was his whole argument that the message was wrong no depth of God that person didn't have on your birth no if you're going to argue over what our Prophet drove we're in trouble no you're in trouble right I don't care if he drove a tricycle come on and said he'd never ride one he was a human being yes sir he had human desires but when that man stood under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost that was God Almighty speaking to us not another person that was God Almighty speaking to us through a conduit of a man man has always stumbled with the flesh brother R said it's hard to get one man to believe another man why cuz we're all human we all see our flaws we all see our mistakes and we have them lot of the things brother R said was his opinion I'm going to tell you some things that's my opinion my dad for 50 years told you some things that was his opinion cuz we're human beings right but when that word of God comes and you say that ain't nothing but the truth hady R didn't have a problem with it she said that ain't nothing but the truth brother and what it was something he was telling if you say today that ain't nothing but the truth may God grant you what you need today may God give you your children your family your wife your friends anybody but it takes saying the right thing yes everybody with me yes so now what's happening we see that when brother R comes on the scene in in 47 he starts preaching in the 30s but in 47 we start hearing the message and what he's doing is is he's not bringing something new he's he's he's getting us back to the faith of the fathers what is the faith of the fathers it's what they believed in the first church age everybody with me we're just we were just a bunch of babblin babies bunch of children that cried about everything they didn't cry Peter didn't cry when that man said I'm blind or or I can't walk Peter says Silver and Gold Have I None but what I have I'll give to you in the name of Jesus Christ W rise up and walk they didn't have to confer with the bishop they didn't have to read 10 message books come on somebody there wasn't even a Bible there at the time they were just going on here say what God Said but it wasn't hear say on the day of Pentecost they knew what brother they knew what brother Jesus they knew what brother Jesus had been saying for three and a half years right and they acted on it as we were talking about Wednesday God has a real sense of humor if you'll go to Second Peter second Peter wrote the book of Peter said now having divine nature of God he said add Faith the very man they cut off a man's ear in the garden right have virtue he cursed three times have knowledge the only knowledge Peter had was is fight that was his whole that was his whole knowledge remember Jesus was always telling him Peter I'm praying for you well now that Peter's got the Holy Ghost and he had all he was a naked fisherman that cussed how much worse can you get he brings us these and he lives them and we see them in his life we see them in the message that he brought that God had changed his life and God used a naked fisherman that cursed to bring us to way for us to live in this day and time now listen back then they didn't have where they put it in this statue of a perfect man but brother randam that's what he come to do he come to restore all this back yes to show us we had Church ages to show us that we had Church age Messengers and who they were but in the first church age there wasn't a church on the corner that had a trinity on it there weren't Church on the corner that said the First Baptist Church of Jerusalem we have that now I told you if you'll go back and read some of the history I've been reading some of the books that one of them's called anatomy of a hybrid it's how we got hybridized from the first church and it wasn't written by met believer either Jee we read those books yeah we read those books sorry amen cuz he was telling the truth what happened was they hybridized and brother Brown preached all that already how they hybridized the word of God am but what they literally done was is they killed the son of man again they killed him the first time 2,000 years ago right physically killed him now we know that the end time brother randam had to indict a generation for the second crucifixion of Christ cuz they did it again they put him on a cross and according to Matthew 17:9 Elijah is going to come and restore all things not just part all and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged him saying tell the vision to no man until the son of be man be risen again from the dead he knew he was going to have to die but I don't know if he knew it or not he was prophesying there'll come a time when kill me again and his disciples asked him saying why didn't the say say the scribes that the last must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things now that wasn't John the Baptist John the Baptist was an introducer he introduced the Messiah he was not a restorer we need we need a restorer as what being the pastor was talking a couple nights ago I if if somebody ever comes up to you and and starts talking talking about what brother R did or didn't do just stop him and say all right look Malachi 4 you can't take that out of the Bible right Malachi 4 is in the Bible 4 5 and 6 he promised he would send me an Elijah the prophet before the end time where is he if you can find him let me know most of the time they won't really know what you're talking about and they sure can't take you to somebody else so I'll just stay with this y'all don't mind I'll just stay right here this is this is good enough for me if he made a mistake so what he was human I like what brother dick Addison said he said I don't care if they proved that brother brandham had five wives and had four or five girlfriends he said that man's word took me to the to the God that I know now listen every prophet in the Old Testament had a flaw they were murderers they were prostitutes they were a lot of bad things but God used them to bring the word through but we know for a fact let me just get this straight brother R didn't have all that he was a human though that human mistakes he had human ideas apart from this word of God he didn't have an idea on the word of God now now when it comes to Doctrine you can't you can't tell me that's that he was wrong in Doctrine now if he was wrong in Doctrine which he said he was opening the seals we'll get to it that transition to Perfection mean it wasn't at first it was partial but brother R stood on the first seal and I've got the seal book part of it here he stood on the first seal and he said I would have made a horrible mistake I was looking at my old nose cuz he had preached a white horse rider was the Holy Ghost 1957 58 or 59 Mighty conqueror he read Revelation 6 and said that was the holy ghost riding through the church ages but he corrected yes sir you don't correct a prophet and nobody corrects a prophet but God he don't stand before nobody but God that's why that's why I told him the other day I said look 1100 sermons thousands of things that happen supernaturally millions of people's been healed Millions upon Millions have been saved under his ministry millions of people been in put in the sixth Dimension because of his ministry where's the fault right y you can find a fault but I mean you can't find the false in this message there is no false because it's the son of man just what he this is the son of man standing here on the mountain right son of man standing on the mountain he said Jesus answered and said Eli truly shall first come and restore all things and we know who that was that was Malachi 4 everybody with me now brother R tells us he said I mentioned it would take the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation look or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real me and Jun were talking about it a couple days ago if you don't study this message are you with me if you depend on just coming here on Sunday and getting your nourishment you're lost amen you're lost and how many of you go back and and when you're not here how many go back and listen to the sermons brother Dell has told you that many times no some of you don't cuz you'll ask me a question I'll say well I said it on tape you didn't hear it oh no I didn't hear it pray the Lord anyhow you'll catch yourself but this is a progressive message you got to listen and study now everybody believes brother Bron was a prophet right everybody right he was a prophet all right he's talking to me and you then right here in this quote bringing these two thoughts together you will see it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic Insight that is our anointing today is prophetic Insight it will require the ability to hear from God it will require Supernatural instructions he didn't say a supernatural Pastor he said Supernatural instructions you have to hear the five-fold ministry but you got to accept it and take it into your field just as that was planted and you got to plant it deep amen but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know that's the way to get it if you can't get it that's the way to get it study read your Bible if you don't miss the service you won't have to listen to it no other time could this message ever come forth till now Jesus say was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man the message could not be until now the world wasn't in the condition as until it is now now listen folks that was 1964 if my Math's correct that's a long time 61 years 61 years this world has revolved and we're standing here today and we got a president in the White House that everybody loves and I ain't a politician well I am I'm a mayor but anyway U praise the Lord anyhow um but like brother Lis said even brother Bob said brother Aaron we all agree there's nobody they going to put in there that's going to turn this thing around we may for a season do good oh everybody's rallying they love you know all this new stuff and and I you know what if that dude gets me where I don't have to pay taxes on my Social Security I'll vote for him again I cannot believe of course I didn't know this I never draw Social Security you draw Social Security they tax your Social Security you paid 700 million time taxes on that thing and they held your money for 50 something years right brother John and they used it boy they're good at that yeah right then when they give it back to you they going to tax it and do something bad with the other part well Trump said he was going to take away that and I'll vote for him again if he does for y'all young people you don't know what that is we'll get a free check every month if you keep working long enough you will too and it ain't very big and you ain't going to be able to live on it much so no other time could this message ever come forth till now the message could not be till now the word wasn't in the condition as until it is now this is the hour that Jesus could appear at any time that's been 60 something years ago what about today what about right now 2025 in January getting ready head into February what about it have we come to a place that we are a prophetic group of people that we do hear from God we do get instruction from God and listen folks you know me I like to I like to have a human life I hunt I get out and do things you don't have to be a messy zombie we're going to get into it a little bit later on but I'm going to tell you something Jesus Christ was God Almighty and human flesh right all right he but he that that flesh was human he was so much human number one brother Joie they didn't believe he's God right they said you you you hang around with Sinners and prostitutes you try that today he was a wine bibber and a glutton he eat a lot and drank wine come on somebody they called him the chief of devils he was God Almighty and they couldn't see that human Veil they couldn't see through that human Veil that he had to eat he probably got sick right he moaned and groaned he cried right but he was God same way with me and you the only difference in me and you and him is I say Wednesday night brother Brandon wasn't God because he was born of sex now we're a part of God because of the new birth no doubt but he was God Almighty the day he was born everybody with me on that cuz he was virgin born the rest of y'all were not so that puts us all in one big pot you you got to decide whether you want to get out of it but Jesus portrayed Jesus Christ portrayed God and they hated him for it they literally hated him for it sir you be a man make yourself God no he was God then made himself a man same way with today today he's living in your flesh isn't he it's the same God but not until this day was promised that that Ministry would come back 100% we are living today under the same Ministry that the disciples did under Jesus yes the difference is they weren't born again we are that's why more given more required listen if they had all been born again while he was teaching them we'd probably never be here there had been a Rapture took place but he had to go away and come back and then they understood why and guess what 11 of those 12 G gave their life John the one who died of of natural death at 90 something years old but the rest of them got sword went through James they got pulled apart by animals they got stoned they got killed everywhere they went so if you got to flower a bit of ease be careful something's coming this message is not for weak people I'm sorry it's just not if a revelation is beyond you now watch if Revelation is beyond you look up and seek God for it that is the only way you're ever going to get it a revelation has to come from God it never comes by human natural and endowments but by spiritual enduement enduement means that goes inside of you all right remember Jesus told him he said you wait to till you be endued with power from on high in other words just not cover me come inside of me so you can make you can even memorize the scripture we had a brother used to come here a long time ago brother Steven he was in prison and he's he's good Brothers they's still in the message somewhere up North but um he could sit here and you could say give me Psalms 54 he' recite the whole thing he had memorized the whole thing some of you was here long enough you'll remember him and he could just I mean he never had to stumble it's just like it was coming right out of his memory but does that do him any good now just makes him where he don't need a Bible you can even memorize the scripture and though that is wonderful that won't do it it has to be a revelation from God it says in the word that no man can say that Jesus is the Christ except by the Holy Ghost you have to receive the Holy Ghost and then and only then can the spirit give you the Revelation that Jesus is the Christ God the anointed one no man knows the things of God save the spirit of God and He To Whom the spirit of God reveals them we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything yes am else in the world we've accepted the Bible we have accepted the great truths of it but it still is not real to most people because Revelation by the spirit is not there that's why when you talk to people it's strange I mean we're going to get we're going to start talking about Thunders and the third pull and squirrels being created go tell them that they'll look at you crossy and tell you crazy what you mean third pole what do you mean fishing what do you mean lures and and lines and all the things brother R told us but you know what I'm telling you that's part of my being if I hear it on tape if I read it I say that ain't nothing but the truth I don't doubt he didn't create squirrel I don't doubt that but you tell other people that the guy we follow created squirrels but now brother B didn't come to change anything he came to restore the doctrine of the first church age all right that's what he did now we know that's the first part that he turned the heart heart the soul of the children Malachi 4 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children now that we know that was who John the Baptist and the Heart of the children to their fathers us back to the faith of the fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse now remember brother R tells us in the church age book that this messenger of Malachi forc to do two things one do this right here but you got to add Revelations 10:7 to that 10 1-7 where the mighty Angel comes down has a book in his hand that's open right and thund the thunder sound right and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when the these things begin to sound the mystery of God will be finished brother R said two things will happen he's going to restore us back to the faith of the fathers which we know he did and then he's going to bring us something that those fathers never knew anything about even though the Bible we this is how God is when brother brandham opened those seals God did through him he didn't have to find a new Bible amen he didn't have to find another book he didn't have to everybody with me it was already in the Bible it was woven in the the Bible in a mystery and that's one thing why they couldn't understand Jesus how about walking around with somebody that talks about birds and fish and stones and and Vipers and and steeds and ground and he spoke in Parables and even his disciples that sometime did not understand what he was talking about but one day when they got the Holy Ghost I'll guarantee you they started talking among each other saidoh that's what he meant yep that's what he meant yep that's what he meant I pray today that that if you don't have the Holy Ghost and you're sitting here and you're listening and you're trying that God will Quicken what we're saying today and Quicken what brother Michael was saying today and bring it to your heart not an anointing we listen we're going to cover all that anointed on at the end time later on but we're living under that anointing too but in dude is inside you can be anointed by the Holy Ghost every day of your life and die and go to hell the prophet said we better know that we know that we know that you got the holy ghost in your soul that toost that anchor that token that you and I supposed to have now listen to what Isaiah said here but they also have aired through wine and through strong drink and are out of the way now watch the priests and Prophets didn't say the people priests and Prophets have aired through strong drink they are swallowed up of wine they are out of the way through strong drink they Heir in Vision they stumble in judgment and I know this is hard to say but they call it being impaired they were drunk on their own self they were drunk on their doctrine that was not true Satan made them so drunk cuz the drunk man what they stumble they can't see well actually they see things that ain't there that's all I've heard for all for all tables are full of vomit we're just human beings here for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there's no place clean now watch Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine then that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast in other words today we go downstairs or you go eat somewhere you're not going to order a glass of milk and that's all you going to have right even though some of us may need a bottle you're still going to order you some steak and some potatoes why because that's what your body craves it's all right to drink milk it's all right for us to go back and and do look at the principles of the doctrine of Christ to do look and and like I said a couple Sundays ago I still get excited about acts 238 amen though I've been in it though though i' I have manifested it I still get excited when somebody reads acts 238 amen so it still excites me when they when Paul tells us that the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ bless you all knowing he wasn't a trinitarian and knowing I'm not one either we got to know that we know as I told y'all before March the 30th I'm going to be preaching at a Methodist Church oh don't worry don't worry everything's all right I know where I'm at if you don't know where you're at you better stay away you may get something on you sorry but we come to the place to where uh we're so weak that somebody can talk us out of what we've been living with for or living for for years one little something they just oh I can't imagine it maybe you can but I can't imagine it I'm glad brother Brown didn't say blessed I'm not going to the Methodist the Baptist and the Pentecostal a lot of you wouldn't be sitting here hello so don't worry if you think something's going to get on you you already got something on you anyway cuz I've talked to several other message preachers and they said yeah I preach for Pentecostal one said I preach for Baptist the other one said yeah I preach for people why they how they going to hear your self-righteousness is going to go and talk talk to them when you can't even talk to them yourself for precept must be on on precept precept upon precept line upon line in other words this thing's got to be lined up right here a little there a little for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people as I was saying the other day you say well I've never spoken in tongues you speak in tongues all the time right you speak in a Heavenly language that 99% of this world does not understand right amen amen go and tell them about the what happened in the garden you might as well be speaking in tongue they ain't going to understand that and they going to call you foolish and they going to say what did you just say well you were speaking in another language see sometimes we want somebody to stand up and and speak in tongues and somebody interpret and say well that's of God we've got God Among Us we got God Among Us anyway we got God Among Us by interpretation and by going out and talking to people and giving them the the word of God the correct word of God and then let them make their decision yes Amen to him he said this is a rest wherein you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear right Jesus told him one time he said you don't he said you're telling me I'm this and that and the other and other words he said and you don't even do what Moses said amen but the word of the Lord was upon them precepts upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little I keep forgetting they interpreting in there so I'm going pause a little bit that they might go now watch they've been given the word of God line upon line this group of people right that they might go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken remember the Bible tells us that he's a stone a stumbling stone that they'll stumble over the word of God so they're going to stumble over you why why do you you know your family love you and everything when you was when you was smoking drinking cussing and doing all those things to the world and you just come into the into the family reunion and it's like oh yeah press God yeah they don't say bless God they say something else but now go to that same family reunion come on that ain't your family this is your family we know listen you're not going to deny your family please don't do that do not deny your family don't say I ain't going cuz I I'm more spiritual than they are I got more than they got then you're you're wrong again that's right go and be a light they'll decide whether they want it or not so teaching is that which is taught or doctrine so Doctrine is teaching it's concerning something it's not just a Doctrine you throw out there everybody with me so it's an act of teaching or instruction and religious Assemblies of Christians to speak in the way of teaching in distinction from other modes of speaking in public to teach one to impart instructions instill Doctrine into one the thing taught to explain or expound on a thing to teach one so what is Doctrine Doctrine is teaching and brother M said a church without a Doctrine is not church so the doctrines we have is who we are when we do go to work when we do when we do go out to make a living when we do go have to walk into the world we're not thinking about the world now come on we do we have to be humans but you're not thinking about a trinitarian Doctrine you're not thinking about I need to go to the Max Factor counter and and uh and buy me some makeup though some of you may have went by there a time or two you should know better amen right but I told somebody one time he said my wife said she gets all this stuff from what is in um PE yeah Ulta and and and all that other stuff we deliver it like crazy like I mean it's like a monthly thing they get and it's all makeup June don't do that so I spend it on hunting amen sister told us one time said my husband didn't want to go to a certain certain place and and and CU he had to buy um get a motel room had to pay for a motel room she said so the next day I went and spent the money that we should would have spent on the motel room so you have to be careful with you sisters but the doctrine you carry should be interwoven who you are you should not have a everybody understand what I'm saying you should not have go out there and leave here go out in the world and then you start thinking different well Trinity may be right there's a lot of people believe that um all this somebody well that brother told me a couple nights ago he said there's another brother that was used to be in the message this night and if I called his name you'd all know him well you know he said well Holiness is just not that's not part of God anymore so his wife she's cut her hair where if you leave this message most 9% of the people don't go back into a Baptist or why would you you you they just go complet completely out in the world CU there's nothing left right can you sit under a Baptist teaching after you sit here for 40 and 50 years and listen to a Baptist no you'd fall asleep like some of you doing now but now look at Luke Luke 4 they who the people around him were astonished at his Doctrine for his word was with power right now what did Brother R tell us that false Doctrine would cause the church to be lukewarm formal and Powerless so the word coming back in power in this end time the word had to come back line by line precept by precept correct then what happened on the day of Pentecost and what happened in the first three Church ages happened to us brother told us remember he had three things in his ministry we won't have time to cover it today but we'll get into a little bit later that's the new part of his ministry it was the three pulls it was he used to take them by the hand his hand would turn all bumpy and all kind of different colors and he'd tell them and then he said the next Ministry would be what you discern the very thoughts and intents of the heart but what is the third one the third one is speaking the word word it's the word being made known that had never had light shown on it before that was the third pull that was the Seven Seals that was the seven Thunders which we'll get into later on so don't get all muddled up about it it's just listen everything God does to a human being now listen to me to a human being he doesn't do in sevens he does them in threes right he does them in threes not sevens now seven is completion three is perfection right I want to be perfected then I can become complete but I got to get perfected first right justification sanctification and baptism of Holy Ghost whatever you want to look in your journey it's those three processes right bring you to the New Birth amen and even when you get born again you're going to go through justification you're going to go through sanctification again Paul says I Die daily everything I do I've got to repent now you didn't do that when you were Justified and Sanctified still out in the world you stay still out in the world Listen folks in this end time right here today you can't be justified and Sanctified and be bride you got to go on to Perfection you got to go on to the new birth but you got to go through them three stages so brother bradam had three stages of his ministry or as we preached a long time ago there was three polls in his journey there's three polls in your journey and we'll talk about that maybe a little bit later but not now Romans 6 now watch but God be than now this is Paul God be than that you were the Servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart what your soul that form of Doctrine which was delivered you being then made free from sin you become the Servants of righteousness all right Romans 16:1 17 now I beseech you Brethren mark them which cause Division and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have heard and avoid them we're all supposed to love our brother there's no doubt but there's going to come a time when you're not going to do the separating God's going to do the separating and they will do the separating for you cuz there are two different spirits right if they clashed in the garden if they clashed in Jesus's time they going to clash today so Mark those which cause Division and offenses and avoid them there's another scripture I think I took out of here but there's another scripture that where brother where uh je Paul was telling them don't even let them in your house whoa you sit on your porch with your false Doctrine but you can't come in my house that work out well wouldn't it so watch Ephesians 4:11 he gave some Apostles prophets pastors evangelists and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying the body of Christ till we all come to the unity of faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lying weight to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ for whom whole the whole body fitly joined together and compacted that every joint supplies according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase listen we're a body hey somebody from Ohio brought 2013 brother Dale preached on um not being an organism I not being a organization but being an organism there's a difference we are an organism we're not an organization CU organiz or organ organization binds you down an organism is just people the things working pretty good you may may watch that one again it's pretty good Clips that's one thing those Brothers they going to be here for the bank for the banquet and I'm just going to give them a star while they're not here I'll give them one when they're here they watch they W they watch our sermons all the time and they go back to 2012 2010 how many of you ever did that and they'll pick a sermon title of brother Dale and they'll play it they have a desire to know sometimes this things becomes common you know Jesus became common to the people sometime even brother Brown became common to the people because he was brother brandham he did those things what about us what do we do what are we doing with this message what are we doing with it huh what are we doing with it you ask yourself what are you doing with it CU it is eternal yes that's right and your Eternal destination depends on you learning this message therefore I say unto thee testify un the Lord that you h Force walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their minds having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through what the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart because of their false teaching because of they listen to false Doctrine 1 Timothy 1:3 this is it right here I beseech you to abide still in Ephesus that I went to Macedonia that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other Doctrine Paul's telling them if you hear anything different from me he said though an angel come from heaven and preach any other gospel different from mine let him be a curse now that's a man knowing what he knows he knows who he isall neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies which minister questions rather than Godly edifying which is in faith so do take heed to yourself th thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing that thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear you you understand what that means brother Michael you can't go and tell your fellow co-workers about this message and say now we still we still believe in a trinity and you can live any way you want to but I got this great message on see you've killed your influence right there you got to have that Doctrine andwell inside of you to where it's just second nature I don't fight at the beer counter they got them things now got they call them beer caves you just walk in no effort at all never has bothered me bothered you why because the doctrine of God has been ingrained in us the message of the hour has been ingrained in US so much where we've heard also we've heard false Doctrine in this pull pit not from Dad not from any of our ministers but somebody come through and I promise you before they got out that door they wasn't a deacon talking to them and they wasn't a pastor talking to them and they wern't a preacher talking to them two of our sisters went and talked to them that's right now you put that in a message church and they'll throw you out bless God a sister ain't going to tell me what to do listen if a sister's got the word of God and you don't number one be ashamed number number two you better listen and that's the truth the brother no more got downstairs and the two sisters had him cornered over in the corner telling him he was wrong if any man Teach otherwise and consent not to Wholesome words even the words of our Lord Jesus into the doctrine which is according to Godliness now watch let's go down to the very end from such withdraw yourself this is Paul talking to Timothy all script is given by inspiration and profitable for Doctrine reprove correction instruction and righteousness that the man of God may be perfect we talking about going from transition from partial to perfect or the transition to Perfection that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works for a Time come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves teachers having ishing ears and they'll turn away their ears from the truth and turned into fables anything contrary to the word of God is a fable well don't get quiet Titus 1 ver9 holding fast a faithful word as he ha been taught that he may be able by sound Doctrine both to exhort and convince the gainsayers for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers especially they of the circumcision talking about the Jews who so mouth Must Be Stopped who subvert whole houses teaching things they ought not for filthy luker's sake so Doctrine is Paramount it's it's something you got to have you got to know your Doctrine as I said last Wednesday you ought know have to call me to come and explain water baptism to somebody that you want to explain to right you can't explain it yourself I'm sorry right if you can't explain water baptism yourself I'm sorry I'm being harsh but we either get to get in this thing or get out of it it's like I said Wednesday night are we Standing on the Promises or just sitting on the premises are we just here we just here cuz this is better than somebody else's are we just here because we feed you or you know like brother Dell always said if we can get you in with the hot dog somebody else can get you out with a hamburger I hope we can get you in with the word of God and you stay in Hebrews 6:1 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on into Perfection now this is Paul not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works or and of Faith toward god listen there's a foundation that we're we're actually sitting and there's a foundation in these in the ground right here right now we're not going to go down there after we get finished with the service and start digging around the foundation why it's set it's not going anywhere it's proved after 5050 something years it's not moving right so why go down there and say well I'm wondering if it's go on to the building go on to the building of the building go on to putting together the things that we need for our everyday life but to change our body to get us out of here sometimes I think we have too much ease in Zion I know we all do right right God's going to pull all this out from under us though you wait and see yes I'm telling youall stock market's going to go crazy job market is going to go crazy housing's going to go down gas is going to go down we're going to be living a wonderful life but the Bible tells us that when there's peace peace there'll be sudden destruction so it may be listen everything in this world's temporary yes stock market is the biggest has ever been but tomorrow it could be a zero and all them people that and bless their heart I mean they're at the post office they've got uh their own uh program and you look at it every day and they said man I made $22,000 last month I said no you really didn't I said uh you might want to try to go get it but you can't get it for right now you got to leave it in there for a while I said but next month it may be $200 you didn't make that your money made that but that's not solid money the only thing solid is this message the don't thing solid is the Bible the only thing solid is the word of God so Paul's telling us to not stay on the foundation of the doctrine of baptism of laying on of hands and resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this will we do if God permit and I looked in the strong concordance that word leaving now Paul said leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ so leaving means to in order to go to another place as I said last Wednesday this is the church okay if we leave this church and go over to that church you've not done away with this church it's still here so the word of God is still here Paul's saying you got to go from here to here in order to go to another place to leave so that what is left watch May Remain the principles leaving the principles the principles is that by which anything begins to be the origin or the active cause or the how and why you got here okay oh it was great wonderful the day I got born again but I want to go on God wants you to go on it's wonderful to to testify but you got to go on got to go on second John 1 ver9 say whoever transgresses and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God he that abideth in the doctrine of Christ he has both the father and the son that does that rattle your brain cuz that's what trinitarians use they say well you deny the father you deny the Son and the Holy Ghost is around here somewhere what wait a minute they don't call it holy ghost it's the Holy Spirit they're scared of a ghost amen I'm not scared of Holy One give me give me that one give me that one give me that ghost if there come any unto you and bring not this Doctrine watch how positive Paul is receive him not this is it receive him not into your house neither bid him don't even say God bless you right I'm reading the Bible I didn't make this up this ain't a quote from me this is the Bible for he that bid with him God speed is partaker of his evil deed right Bible Acts 20: 27 for I have not shun to declare unto you all the counsel of God take heed therefore unto yourselves to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he has purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing he's getting ready to end his life he knows he's fixing to die for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock and as I said Wednesday night Paul is preaching to a group of people and then he looks at and said some of y'all going to do the same thing he didn't exclude them he didn't say somebody was going to come in he said it would be Grievous wolves enter in but he said some of you also of your own self shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them let's read it right here and then we'll then we'll be won't get into the new ministry but just if you if you want to put that in put that in put in a new ministry and brother random and the reason we're going to talk about it is it's because it's it's a little bit it's hard to understand if you don't understand what he's saying CU brother brother brandham says the first quote he makes is in 1958 about this new ministry that God's given me okay now he continues on into 59 he said this new ministry I'm going to try it tonight well then he comes to the the next quote he says well well how many's been in my meetings and hardly ever people anybody rais their hand he said well I don't think I'll do that tonight I think I'll go back to the other to the other way you I mean he's sitting there changing it back and forth but his new ministry was the opening of the word he thought the new ministry may be just something else because he was talking about taking them back in a little room and and talking to them personally one to one but God is going to he's going to about 1963 God's going to turn him around and he's going to say this is this is your new ministry right here when he went out to Arizona and met that cloud he knew his ministry was going to change then we saw pieces of it and parts of it with the creating of the squirrels and hady R and all the different things like that but you're going to see that his progression of Revelation yes I believe he progressed in Revelation when God told him in 1958 he' to have a new ministry he still talks about 1959 he still talks about it in 1960 and we'll look at that God willing the next time we we speak we won't have time to do that but I wanted to back up a little bit since somewhere here Wednesday night now watch oh this is the second seal this is where I was reading this morning now remember what is a Doctrine it's what you live by Doctrine today your Doctrine today is what you live by look notice when Satan now everybody that realizes that Satan controls all political power of the world he said so so he controls even you know the man that stood up and said God spared my life so that I could turn this country around everybody's a tool in the hand of God good and bad he's using Satan right he'll use Satan to drive you but to him oh come on somebody brother Ram said that that God will allow a brother to say something bad about you to see how you'll react so don't think that you're don't think you're immune to all this all the kingdoms belong to him that's the reason they fight war and kill and remember isn't that strange they were given the sword to kill one another this is on the second seal he's talking about coming to from the first seal to Second seal oh my notice now look when he did that he did not have the ecclesiastical power yet you see what's happening now you never heard the previous presidents talk so much about God and how God spared his life and how God's going to use him and how God this and we're going to put God back into this and God back into that they're going to put God back into it all right they're God cuz they're all part if you're not born again today you're part of the God of this evil age that's but he started Ed with a demon of a false teaching and that teaching became a doctrine that Doctrine became incarnate in a false prophet and then he just went to the right place he never went to Israel he went to Rome amen wow so what was the first Doctrine Jesus preached no what was the first doctrine that was outside the Bible it was from Rome so all the false Doctrine started in Rome right now remember brother R tells us that there was true Born Again Believers he said prophets at one time went to NAA to try to give their view or their point of view and they were just totally driven out and actually became part of that system that's right notice when they got back when these saints of God tried to hold up that word Rome came right in and accepted dogmas instead now let's just see what they did some of their false Doctrine what she done we know what it was water baptism um Peter said repent and be baptized what Rome do they turned it around said be baptized in name of Father Son and Holy Ghost making it a Creed not a doctrine of the Bible sprinkling all these different things came from the Catholic church and look how strong it is folks let me tell you this before we close I wish that our Doctrine on the surface was as strong as theirs you think run that around in your head for a minute they'll die for theirs the pope they if the pope came out and somebody tried to kill the pope there'd be 100,000 people dive on top of him and and get you know probably take the person that tried to kill him and kill him I don't think that'll happen here but we believe the message of the hour or do we believe that we believe in one God not a trinity We Believe water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they didn't they don't listen folks 99% of the world that's what I'm saying they are so passionate about their Doctrine why can't we be that way we ain't got to look to a pope we look to Jesus Christ but then God give us a five-fold Ministry from God to tell us all these great Mysteries and to break it down to the people and what do we do we come when we want to when we feel like it we come to church we don't and I'm not going to listen to him again me and brother Bob was talking the other day and I do I hate to hear my voice I'll listen to myself sometime to see certain things but I hate to hear my voice and Bob said I hate to hear mine too so we listen to all the other ones I listen to him and he listens to me I don't listen to them I listen to myself and they all believe in eternal hell all denominations do even the Roman Catholics have inserted Purgatory they inserted something ain't even in the Bible and we know holding his conduct and dress I drove by a church a few minutes ago and sister was walking in she needed a dress on she had old jeans and that I think that was painted on her but going into church to worship yes hair cut off you say well we we yeah we need to be away from Holiness we need to not have to preach this it's in the Bible brother R didn't change the Bible he just absolutely Shone light on the Bible that we've been reading for 2,000 years it never changed but now I'm telling you though when you read it Through The Eyes of the Holy Ghost didn't it sound different didn't it sound different so holiness conduct and dress Church order Lord they don't have no church order now folks I promise you none brother ran said he said they have now become lodges and that's exactly what they are I'm sorry there's some good people out there but you walk in a Baptist church today or even a Methodist church today and it's just like it's just like um like you're in a restaurant people drink a coffee people eating biscuit or something in the sanctuary and I seen it myself or I wouldn't be saying this right talk about the ball game talk about everything else then about about time kind of like some of y'all do about time church starts you migrate in hello somebody we got it we're not going to get away from church order on brother Brown told us be here 20 minutes before the service starts not 20 minutes before the preaching starts service starts at 10:00 now what's the problem what's your problem don't get quiet it's Church order it should be indwelled and ingrained in you to be here early cuz if not you bring every demon in the world I'm telling you I would be too I have to pray back there I have to pray in here to get them things off of me well if you don't have them pray for me amen now try to explain serpent seed to somebody and they will throw you they'll put you in jail for that nobody ever preached a body change between Sarah and Abraham but it's always been in the Bible when you put the Love Letter together you see that she took a 300 mile Journey you see that a a king that that could have any pretty woman in the whole land picked the brother Brown said picked old grandma 100 year old grandma well she wasn't 100 years old anymore she was beautiful the king wanted her and he was taking her if God hadn't done what he did remember he gave him a dream every denomination believes there's tribulation for their bride right and they all have to go to the white Throne judgment we don't we don't go through tribulation nobody understood about the church ages or The Messengers until brother V come along is that you a perfect man it's always been in second Peter but we didn't know how to articulate it to get it to us that we're supposed to grow and come to adoption and then the 70 weeks of Daniel how he put that together we'll look at all these great things but I want to get one thing real quick right here since Jesus said I indict this generation or or brother R said I indict this generation when Jesus told him in there in Matthew said the son of man will be risen again now if a son of man has to raise he must have got killed somewhere right remember the second time wasn't physical the second time was spiritual amen listen God cannot work in false Doctrine sure he'll work in the ignorance of the time that you're in listen to me he worked in Luther and Wesley it wasn't time for full Perfection now is the time for precept line it all be straightened out all should know how to live this not this message live the Bible my indictment is against the churches of today I'm not bringing the center into this I'm just speaking this to the church and it's on tape I try to get through it quick now to do this in this age we live in I do this I must show in evidence now remember when you bring an indictment you got you bring somebody in you indict them because they've done something right or allegedly done something then you got to bring the evidence right then you got to bring a conviction right then you got to have somebody carry out that conviction there's a sentencing phase after all right so now brother brandham he brought an indictment told him why they killed Jesus Christ told them they had turned the blood down and we showed that we are the blood by the spirit of God you and I are that bumper blood you said no that's Jesus brother Brown said we're the blood by the spirit we are what's keeping this world from going totally insane I told Brother Dutch and sister April we just came from our house through Gainesville which ain't very big well it is now and then to get all the way to Jasper it was Bumper to Bumper you noticed all that we got so much traffic we're going to head out here in just a little while I'll guarantee you when we get to Chattanooga there'll be four lanes in both directions and they'll be running 5 miles an hour just because you wait till this thing falls apart folks you think it's bad now we better make preparation to get out of it not have to be caught in it could you imagine be caught in a traffic jam that were miles and miles and you and you know that you needed food for your kids and you needed gas amen I don't like I'm not a doomsday preacher but these things will happen they're going to happen amen and I say they'll help happen in our lifetime because we see the part of it now that that there's there's no Road for nobody is every everything's all jammed up and they're wanting to get somewhere real fast so he brings an indictment he brings the evidence he brings a conviction he convicted them for crucifying Christ he could not have been done a few years ago 50 years ago and then he said 10 years ago but it's today because he come on the scene as the prophet in the end time he can indict that whole generation tell them why and then convict them but I said before it takes a carrying out of the sentence well who's going to carry that that sentence out brother R's gone he's not here anymore you and I are going to carry that sentence out you and I when we come to Perfection and we prove to the world that God's in us and not out there amen you and I will be carrying out the sentence you know how I can type that Elijah number one stood and said Jezebel the dogs will eat your blood right that's what he said right he went off the scene Elijah number two Elisha number or Elijah Elisha come on the scene and brother R said who did that TI the bride the bride carried out and saw the sentence being carried out because Elisha was the one standing there when jus throw her out the window and the dogs eat her blood so guess or eat her body so you and I are here to carry out that sentence if it would have just been brother RAM and he left and there's no power come on folks if there's no power left in the church then we're defeated that's right there was a there was a a crucifixion but there was no Resurrection you and I are the resurrection of that word of God you and I are the people that's going to see this carried out you're going to see the dead raised you're going to see the stones get rolled away oh Hallelujah I just believe it's us we're not going to go to the grave site with a tape player or a book it's going to be human beings that have come to a place that God can trust us to say let the resurrection happen let it be now it's going to be the voice of the bride and the bridegroom it'll be the voice of the Bride through the bridegroom that's going to raise the dead it's not going to be a tape player not going to be how many pictures we like pictures and we like pens that's okay that just identifies what we believe but this is not going to you know you know it's not going to save anybody if you wear that to a restaurant nobody's ever asked me what that is you know if you got other little pens on they say what's that what's that for they don't ask about that I tell them and then they you know what they do yeah okay right what do you mean the Prophet come what do you mean he went out in Arizona what do you mean that that this great big cloud came up came uh up in the sky and and uh brother Brown says seven angels man says it was Rockets man's always deluded the word of God what have we done now listen just one come on musicians 1956 this is the first time and then we'll we'll cover it from right here I want to background since we were preaching Wednesday on this um just in case you didn't watch it again in 1956 now this is 1956 and watch what brother R said in then we'll then we'll be finished brother randam why do you have such Faith Standing There Ain't You Afraid there'd be a mistake no sir 1956 aren't you afraid you'll say something wrong no sir God said so that settled it amen that's just all there is to it are you afraid now you making this concerning this new ministry that you're entering do you think that's going to be you say greater yes how do you know God said so oh I haven't got one bit of doubt my heart's just leaping and jumping to it see because God said so that settled it that's just all there is to it it's going to be that way God said so and that settles it he talks about it in 1958 now we went from 56 to 58 we'll go real quick preach in 1958 1960 he's talking about his new ministry but look he said it's not the discernment his new ministry wasn't discernment because in 1960 right brother a 1960 he'd been Discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart for years but see I think he thought it was going to be greater in the prayer line but it wasn't greater than that it was greater in the word of God now it's not in discernment discernment I find them things out but this is not discernment I'm searching for a new ministry all of you understand and they did not amen 1960 brother Brown said this is the time that there's a new ministry coming ahead of me I better go back then he said no there's not many people here that know me I better go back to the old ministry tonight and then have the new ministry start tomorrow evening it never started the new ministry is the curse the disease that's in there there'll be another sign which you were born with you'll see visions and know that people has done and all about them and so forth that wasn't it remember it's not the discernment not discernment tell you this the Lord told me there'd be another Ministry you remember that that been four years ago which would be the Discerning of the thoughts of the heart and so forth well them Ministries had worked perfectly the world around one went its day the other lived its day he's bringing in the new ministry I'll speak the word first was what sign of the hand second pull was discernment I'll read it to you oh I think it's annoying ones at the any time the second pull was a discernment what's the third pull the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed and that's what we're coming to Let's stand to our feet let's don't get behind amen let's don't get behind let's sharpen our pencil and let's not get behind see brother Brown says the second Ministry is leaving and the third is entering in how about that so he knew what was going on he just didn't know exactly which way it was coming from but it was coming from the opening of The Seven Seals where man had never ever seen before you love the Lord let's study this word more than we've ever studied before let's see what God will do for us you say I don't see God doing anything well maybe it's your fault start with your house first I'll start with my house first you start with your house first brother Bown tells us he said you get a church in the right frame of mind he said God can do anything he wants to do through us let's do that let's get God on our Forefront from this day forward it's a brand new year and we all are going to have I I pray that that uh um I got my birthday today I pray y'all get yours but if we don't go into Rapture we'll just have it later on but um but we pray that that God will do something in your life just like brother rown said God said so let's let him do it you say I need healing let God do it he's already done it and mean I need my children saved well so did hady right but you know what she was so under that anointing she was listening to the prophet and she said that ain't nothing but the truth just like Mary said that day Mary said be it unto me according to Thy word and a supernatural happening a person was born with no
