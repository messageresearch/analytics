practice too I mean it's just like you know everybody keeps trying to get all these things um ironed out and everything like that well sometimes if you just let the spirit move you know because sometimes we try to get everything perfect but sometimes it's just let the spirit move and uh so that's way it's going to be tonight we're just going to trust the spirit tonight but uh let's just uh bow our heads before we uh read the scripture this evening Heavenly Father we thank you for this time Lord that we're able to gather those of like Precious Faith Lord Jesus Lord we thank you for the day and hour which we live Lord that Lord the prophet said that if he could choose any day to to live in he'd want to live in this day and and Lord what a wonderful thing to realize Lord that you called us to live in this hour to fight this battle Lord there's many that the prophets and those of old Lord they look for this Time Lord and here we are at the Fulfillment of of your word and Lord let let's just continue to fight the battle Lord be ever faithful Lord your lord your word's true and Lord it it's carried us all this way Lord we know that it'll carry us all the way Lord we just commit ourselves into your hand tonight Lord bless the word bless the hearers Lord just let us get ourselves out of the way Lord that you can have the preeminence in this service we commit all things to you in the name of Jesus Jesus Christ amen amen Genesis chapter 1: 1 says in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning was were the first day amen God bless you may be seated and uh I want to look at this tonight you know um here in the in the scripture you know brother Brandon was talking about God when he created creating the heavens and the Earth and it's in darkness and there and it's without form and void and and all this and we don't know how long it was that he created the heavens and earth we just know that he created it amen but there came a time when the spirit of God moved upon the the Earth and he began to move and brother R said you know he brooded over the Earth and he began to move and he began to do because he had a had a plan a purpose on what he was doing and he moved upon the upon the the Earth and you know and then he said let there be light and you and so you know we know how this story it came into existence and God began to speak and bring th bring things into existence in the earth and BR bring it into the place that he wanted all of it to be and you know a individual our Our Lives typed this this scene right here because we came in darkness without form and void and we didn't have the spirit of God with us and we dealt in darkness but we but there came a time when God came and he brought this light and he spoke this light and it came into existence now you know sometimes when we look at when we look at this scene we think in our in our minds you know we we see this great light that come into existence which it was a great light but you know it wasn't a great light so much in what we see because God didn't blind us with light he just brings light a little bit out of it at time right and you know we see this light come in and you know because you know in John chapter one there he was speaking of the the in the beginning was the word and he said and he in him was life and the life was the light of men and you know he came into existence but he said he said but they did not he said the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not because when the light Shone forth into the darkness they didn't comprehend what what they were seeing and there came but you know there was a group of people that did catch that light but it came gradually you know there was a there was a just that spark that came and you know that's the reason I was talking about as a as a flash because you know it's just a momentary light or just just a portion of light that came into existence that everybody could see because it was just that part to for you to see and you know when when you go back and look and if you look at your life and you see that you know you're you're in this darkness and and everything is so dark and you you know as brother R was talking about you couldn't see your hand before your face and you he said the darkness was so so large and so heavy that you know you felt the darkness and you're in this and and you're in this place but he said just the smallest amount of light he said it chases the darkness away he said it just takes just that momentary light and that's all it took was that momentary just that spark just a small light and you know in our lives we were we we were living in darkness and and and you know all the things that we we we thought we had life and we thought everything was good but you know somewhere down on the inside of us when we took a real measure of Our Lives you know what we were in darkness we were we were so in ingrained in this Darkness you know there was no way of escaping this but you know God came and brought light into our into our in our our midst and you know if we all were are all honest with ourselves how many times did the light of God come into our lives and we turned it down how many times did he come and try to deal with us and we we rejected him and you know he came and he and he stirred our Waters and we just couldn't yield ourselves to the Holy Spirit and you know it was just like being in a storm you know you're in this darkness and you see this storm coming and all of a sudden you see these flashes of lightning and all of a sudden everything begins to light up and you see these things taking place and you know don't respond to that you know and and this this is where uh brother brand brother random say one time he was talking about the lightning and he said you know the light shines in the darkness he said it proves no matter how dark it is there still can be light amen and so no matter how much Darkness there is there's always going to be light am and no matter where you're at there's always going to be light shining and and and the message message this is where I kind of got my inspiration from I was reading the the message the UNC oncoming storm 1960 and you know brother BR tells the story about the young man that came to him in the meeting and he come he couldn't wait till the end of the Ser service to come and he wanted to find God and you know brother BR was having a healing service and he said sure son he said I'll lead you to Christ but he said he said I got to know God for myself and you know he came and he came to brother brandom he said Parson he Saidi want to tell you my story and and you know he was talking about being up there in that pulpwood camp and you know he was up there in that storm and you know he was out there and you know he kind of run from his family he said the rest of my family's Christian but he said I wasn't a Christian he said I just kind of lived my own life and he said you know I broke and I ended up in this pulpwood camp and they were going to give me a job and he said he said well I can cook do you do you need a cook and he's like know but we got this elderly black lady in here that cooks for us said maybe you can help her so he went in there they paid him some money to help her and you know that one night he said I was laying there and he said all of a sudden he said there was flashes of light that caught my attention and he said I couldn't figure out what was going on but he said those flashes of light caught my attention and he said then I heard voices speaking and he said I couldn't figure out what was going on he said so I woke up and he said I realized it was the boss and the teamster and they were talking about the horses and he said that the condition that they were in that northerner he said because he said if we don't do something right now he said we may not be here much longer because that storm was so bad that he said nothing would be left and he was laying there and he was thinking he said I got so scared and he said he said I was I was laying there thinking about this he said that elderly lady was in the other tent the other part over there and he he she began to call to him he said son come here and you know she began to speak to him and she asked him said are you a Christian are you are you saved and he's like no I'm not and and she saidwell listen you better get to him right now because you don't have much time left you don't know how much longer you're going to be here because he said we may you may have to go meet him really soon and you know he said he said she be said nail down right here and begin to pray and he said I was so scared he said I could not pray he said I was so scared what was going to take place and he said he was he said I pray to the Lord he said if you get me out of here he said I'm going find somebody to lead me to Christ but he said what was so amazed amazed him he said he was sitting there he was telling brother brand he said that elderly lady was sitting there and he said she was calm as she could be she had anchored into something that she didn't she wasn't worried about what was going to take place but he was standing there and he was so worried and he said he said when he got away from there he he got to this meeting where brother Brown was and he had to tell brother brand he said I want to find Christ and you know he brother brand began to speak to him and you know he was so relieved and he got down on his knees and he's like listen it doesn't matter what condition you're in he said when God stir your water when God brings that light into your into your life and it begins to see you and you begin to follow that light when you begin to go after that light and desire what God is calling you and you you have a response to that then then God will meet you there and then you know he because he that he said because that young man found what he was looking for that day and he said God gave him a chance he said but you may not have another opportunity this may be your last opportunity you don't know when you're going to pass away or what's going to change in your situation but you know he give her he gave this young man the opportunity to receive what he was looking for and God called him out the goodness of God called him to repentance and he answered that call and you know and that's the way we are we have to answer the call of God that we need to go after what God has called us to do God is is calling us to go after these things and you know if if you're if you're not saved and tonight's the night that you need to get right with God but you know it's the same thing is whatever you have need of or wherever you are whatever condition you're in tonight tonight's the night because today is the day of salvation today is the day that we've got to get ready because we don't know how much longer we're going to be and tonight is the night that if if if if you have anything that that you want to get rid of tonight's the night to get rid of it if you're looking for an answer tonight then God is here to give you your answer tonight whatever it is because I I you know I realized because one of the things I was looking at T is I realize this is probably my the last sermon I'm going to preach this year here and this and this is just something that's on my heart to share because listen I don't want to carry over things I don't want to carry over things into a new year and I I know it's not about making resolutions or doing all these kind of things but you know now we come to the end of the year we we start to look back at our lives we begin to look back over the year and all the things that God has done for us and where he's brought us to and we be and we take a inventory of of of our lives and where we stand today and is realizing you know I'm not what I used to be but I'm not what I want to be and I'm not want to all to be but you know what tonight I realize that I have the opportunity to be what I want to be I have the opportunity to be molded into Jesus Christ and to lay down all of the all of the sin and everything all the weights that so easily beset us and run the race that's set before us I have the opportunity to do that tonight and you and I we have that opportunity tonight am so I you know I want I want to lay these things out I just want to pour out my heart tonight because you you you have to go after these things you have to realize that what God has called you too and what God has given you you've got to understand it belongs to you it's it's God's it's God's word to you you've got to take it and go with it it's not for anybody else you know you you think about you think about Mary you know here here She is is this young virgin girl teenage girl being a spouse to an older man Joseph and you know here she is and and she's reading the scripture reading the Scrolls hearing the the priests talk about Isaiah's prophecy of what was going to take place here all this time she's she believes it she hears it she knows it's the truth but you know here she is beginning to speak that even you even having times where she's sitting there and her and Joseph are talking about what's going to take place because you know what this is this is the Messiah they're looking they're looking for God to be made flesh that the word is going to be fulfilled and what a glorious day that we're we're looking for and you know as she begins to see all these things and you know she begins to ponder these things and what is going to take place and how wonderful it's going to be when we see these things and but you know what God began to deal with her realizing she was the one it wasn't some somebody else that was going to do that and you know she began to deal and you know when you think about and you and you meditate on the word and you think about these things see that God begins to deal with you when you when you're meditating on the word and he begins to come to speak to you because you know when when you bring him into your presence and you you come into His presence and you know you're you're welcoming him and and you want to meditate on him and you want to thank him and you want to pray and you want to praise him then you know he comes to to you and he begins to begins to speak to you and have fellowship with you and know here she here's Mary they praying and thinking on these things and thinking about what a wonderful thing is because you know it could be just any day that the Fulfillment of God's word is going to take place and we're going to have the Messiah God made flesh in our midst but you know in in the midst of all of that that she was facing and talking about it and having this Fellowship there was a flash of light brother R said that came and all of a sudden gab Gabriel is standing in her midst and beginning to speak to her and he says hell Mary and and and so brother BR says that means for her you know to stop and listen but you know all of a sudden hear of this thing that he was speaking to her and all of a sudden here it is this message is not for somebody else this message is for you here it is it's for you and then he's beginning to speak to to her because she believes this is going to take place this is true and he said blessed art thou among women see you're going to be the one that's going to bring forth a child you're going to be the one that's going to fulfill this word it's not going to be somebody else there's not no other virgin that's going to do it guess what God has chosen you to do this this is yours and then all of a sudden you know no no no doubt as brother R said you know she was frightened you know you know you got confidence and you got faith all until God tells you hey you're going to do this and then it's like well how am I going to do this how how am I going to how just just this young insignificant teenager how am I going to do this he's like listen it's it's not what you're going to do he said but the holy spirit's going to overshadow you and you're going to bring forth a child you're going to do this well you know she didn't understand everything but you know what she un she believed what Gabriel told her what the angel had told her and then she said be it unto me according to Thy word you know she she believed what was said to her and she took it and realized you know it it would it would taken some time for her to come to the place to realize that she was pregnant but you know what she didn't lose her faith she walked in the faith of that and began to testify and you know then when it tells her you know when the Gabriel is telling her about Elizabeth having having a child in her old age and you know she's six months and you know then all of a sudden Mary is so elated that she's going to go tell Elizabeth what has happened and she and she's Overjoyed what's hey listen I got I got to spread this and tell somebody the god the god of Miracles is com in our midst but you know sometimes sometimes because when God do does these things in our midst sometimes we we can get to the place where it's just like you know it's like we there there's there's no where there's no excitement there's no thrill there's no Zeal there but you know it's like when she when she got this message why because it was something that she had been waiting on it's something that she knew was going to take place and all of a sudden when it came it came to her it was her word it was she was the one that was told that was going to do this and then she got up and she was she was so elated she had to go find Elizabeth to tell her listen the angel has come and spoke to me and told me I'm going to bring forth the Son of God well here's here's the Messiah it's the Fulfillment of the word and here here I realize that according what Gabriel said look you're expecting a child after all these years of struggle and heartache all of a sudden now you're reach God has blessed you amen and here it is and then you know but you know Elizabeth hadn't had seen him move or any nothing had taken place but I just at the mention of the name Jesus you know she said the baby jumped in my womb and here it is something that's taking place see it was it was a reaction and you know each one of them having their own but you know what the world didn't know that the world didn't respond to that that's right you know even even Joseph and and you know Zacharias you know here he is the angel coming to him and speaking to him here's a great learned man and and knows the knows the scripture and knows the law and everything and here comes an angel and has he has a supernatural experience and you know what all he can do is doubt and dispute with the angel here is God trying to deal with him and trying to tell him what's going to take place and how can these things be what's your credentials and he told himself listen your mouth caused you a lot of trouble so guess what we're just going till the baby's born you can't say nothing and it'll save you a lot of trouble there's been times in my life if the Lord had done that to me that had saved me a little trouble too amen but here's Joseph here's Mary telling them this Supernatural thing that happened the angel had come and spoke to her and told her all these things well you know what Joseph didn't understand it but you know what he didn't he didn't dispute it but what did he do he was praying about it he was seeking God like how is this possible but God came to speak to him in a dream and told him not to worry about taking Mary as your wife this is a supernatural experience see he each had each one of them had to have their own experience and it's whether it's and it was up to them whether they believed it or not but each one of them had to have their own experience and you know here's Mary walking all all these years you know continuing on and you know having having a bad name and how everybody just rejected her and and all those type things and everybody ridiculed her and everything but you know it didn't it didn't diminish her testimony it didn't diminish what was on the inside of her what what stirred inside of her it still kept burning amen see she just kept on going and kept walking and you know even even when she went through all all the things that went that she went through but you know what she know what was the Fulfillment of that amen but it wasn't it wasn't a it wasn't for everybody it wasn't a public show not everybody got to see that but it was something that was real to her it was something personal to her and here she is carrying this child all the way through amen now I I I don't know I don't I don't think she did but you know I mean you know when you begin to read these scriptures because sometimes the scriptures that are in the in the New Testament when they talk about the birth of Jesus and everything you know sometimes in the old test the the priest and all this they didn't understand those things because when go back in the scripture and the Fulfillment of it takes place in the gospels they say that this might be the Fulfillment of what Jeremy Jeremiah said it goes back to the scripture and points back to what what the Old Testament was saying showing that was the Fulfillment of the Old Testament they didn't see those things so did did she understand what was going to take place in the future probably not but she walked in what she knew and what she believed and she kept going and it's like well you know all of a sudden we've got to go pay taxes in Bethlehem what did she did she think ahead of time oh this is this is going to be the Fulfillment of scripture no she's just looking ahead and thinking I'm this much pregnant and I've got to travel all those many miles I got to go all this way and I'm sure there was a lot of days she was just sitting around praying that the day would hurry up be over with cuz I want to leave lay down I don't want to travel anymore but not realizing that was the Fulfillment of scripture and here she is no doubt she's she's ready to give birth and all you know tired and achy and everything and all these problems and everything and not realizing she's walking in the Fulfillment of scripture amen and it's just like we we don't don't see that and all of a sudden you know here she is I can't find a place to to rent to stay in b Bethlehem and you know like well you know we're back in a thousand and not realizing that's but but it's fulfilling the scripture it's fulfilling the scriptural type and here she is you know they end up in in the manger in the in the stable you know and you know here they are going through all these things not realizing it's a ful fulfillment of scripture and all of a sudden you know she's going through all of this and labor and you know all all the hardships that she went through and here she is ends up in this place and all of a sudden according to the scripture when when all this took place you know here there are the shepherd show up because they come because the Angels had told them listen the savior's born tonight well you know they they show up because you know what hey they're they're excited right amen well sometimes what happens is you know it was something that was something that took place to Mary but all of a sudden then you realize you know what this this was some God's working on both ends not just on one end this is not because you know this is not just something that's done in in a back room or you know hidden from everything but God began to show her that this was true and it began to bring those people in and and and you know you look at all the things that she had went through all the ridicule and everything but here these men the Magi God swed a s sign in the sky and they followed it for years and here here She is you know going about her daily life they're going through their daily life going through the things that they've been through you know just just living an ordinary life just paying the bills going through living and all of a sudden here these men show up and it's supernatural thing happening and here these men are asking everybody where is he born King of the Jews it's like what what what are you talking about you know and herod's like there's a king you know is this is it where where where where's all this supposed to take place you know he's want to know what's going on and where where are we supposed to find these things but you here they are they come all this way bringing these gifts to to Mary and Joseph and looking for this child that's the Fulfillment of scripture this is the one that we've all been waiting on and sometimes sometimes we get we people get and even we do do that sometimes we get to the place where it just becomes common and you know we just kind it just kind of washes away and you know and then all of a sudden we get this thing that takes place and it snaps us back to the place and realize hey look where you're standing look what you're doing look what look what God has done for you then all of a sudden you're standing in the midst and realize you know what this is not just some little boy but this is the Fulfillment of scripture and you know what and not only were you looking for this and seeking this but you know what there was other people looking for the exact same thing and they came to the place and here they are bringing their gifts unto this child bringing the gold frankincense and Mer showing that what he was supposed to do he was deity dedicated to death what he was going to do he was fulfilling the scripture here he is in the in the midst of all this and all the things that went on and sometimes you know we don't see we don't see the the picture of the plan of God all we see is just the things that happen around us we don't see those things right brother amen but here she was she came along and it really just moved and all of a sudden the supernatural began to happen and see it's the same way see we see these things how it just begin to take place in in their lives and here they are all all these things that were taking place that was happening you know no doubt he was just you know Jesus was just a just a little boy that just GRE grew up like everybody else and you know he had to go through the same things that everybody else had to go through and you know I mean you know he had to learn how to walk and talk and everything else you know I mean but you know I mean he came but God began to deal with him from a young age and you know when they went to the when they went to the Passover and they were there in the in the temple you know he was he was talking to the doctors and questioning them about the law and everything like that they you know they were up and gone and he was he was in he said well I must be about my father's business why cuz he knew who he was but you know he began to grow in Grace and knowledge and and all these things but you know there was something that was taking place and here it is you know sometimes you know we're just worried about the laundry and and different things like that and all of a sudden God begins to speak to you and realize you know there's other things Beyond those things there's there's things that that are happening and sometimes we realize well it's just paying the bills and and taking the kids to school and doing this and all the other things and not realizing the supernatural happens in our midst and we miss it amen see many times you know God is there wanting to speak to us and you know we're too busy with too many other things that we miss God God wants to have fellowship with us and he wants to speak to your heart because he wants to reveal his word to you many times we don't have time for him because we got too many time we get too much stressed out of of too many things and not realizing that what God wants us to do is put all of our cares upon him cuz he cares for us and I have I have to remind myself of that sometimes because with my with my job you know I get I just get aggravated with people like I like I told you before you know you go in there and tell them listen this ain't this ain't the this ain't the way it used to be and this ain't this ain't the way it's supposed to be and you got to keep pointing them back to what the standard is amen hey we got we got a job to do and there's a standard and there's a way of doing it and either you either do it right or don't do it at all and it's the same way with the word of God there's a standard there's a there's a law there's a there's a process for everything and you this is what we got to follow it's not my idea it's not somebody else's idea it's not the pastor's idea it wasn't even brother bram's idea but it was God's word it was God's thought that came forth and you know what all we got to do is say Amen to it and we got to claim it and believe it amen see we take those things and you know you see the things as they they begin to move and here's Jesus preaching and you know growing up and and becoming into the into the ministry and begin to preach and you know he began to you know seek out to the disciples and and you know all those things that you know he began to minister to the people and he began to tell them what was going to take place and understanding the scripture what was taking place in the day and hour in which they live and you know it wasn't for everybody not everybody agreed with it not everybody believed it but you know what it was still the truth and it was the time and so because you know there was a group because you know as he said you know the ones that God has called me he's given me he said they're going to come to me right he said you know he said I as he told the disciples that day he said I've not you've not chosen me I've chosen you and he began to call to them amen and here the and here they are the disciples you know here they are just working their jobs and doing their doing their daily duties and going through everything going through the motions of life and and all that but you know when when God came to the came on the scene you know he began to speak to them and speak to their situations and begin to speak to them and you know brother Bram said here when when he began to speak to like Peter and and he was talking about Nathaniel when you know when when they you know he's like you know can any good thing come out of Nazareth and you know all these things but you know what God began to but when Jesus came into his midst he began to speak to him in his situation and he began to speak to him he said he said Rabbi when when when did you ever know me he said I saw you under the tree say I knew all about you and they began to speak to them and you know when it began to stir their waters you know when it began to when it began to move in the situation in which they lived you know as brother R was talking about Peter and and as and Andrew I believe was you know their their father began to talk to him all about the scripture and about the Messiah coming and all these type things it's like you know I I may not be able to see this fulfillment this may be in your day but never take your eyes off of this always keep looking to see the Messiah is coming and when he began to speak to these things then you know brother BR said you know when the when the word came in there and they began to see the Fulfillment even the thoughts of their their hearts Jesus began to speak to them and began to speak he said when the light flashed across their lives and they began to see those things he said you know what you didn't you didn't have to go back and and say anything else to them he said you know because he said they went they went right to the Altar and they got they got saved he said you didn't have you didn't have to try to pull and tug on them or anything like that because when something Supernatural came their way and touched them you know what you wer you weren't going to get them away from that it was something that supernaturally took place in their lives and you know they went after that they were sold on that even even even in all their faults and failures and and not understanding the scripture and all the things and didn't understand Jesus and his and his ministry and all kinds of things but you know there was Peter standing there and he said Lord to whom shall we go thou alone has the words of eternal life even when he seen everybody walking away and all the confusion and everything there was a lot of confusion in him that he didn't understand things but you know what he never got away from that there was something that anchored inside of him he couldn't get away from that and so you know he began to follow that and you know he was like Lord he said I don't know where you go or what you're going to have to face you know even when Jesus began to talk to he said but you know what I'll be right there with you to the end he said everybody else will forsake you he said but I'll be right there I'm not I'm not leaving you he's like listen Peter you know I love you but I'm G I'm GNA have to tell you something and you're not going to like it you're not going to follow me you know and it's like no yeah they listen P yeah before the Croc crows you're going to deny me three times just you know I mean he just trying to talk to Peter but you know Peter's so bullheaded you mean he's just so strong and no but you know what it was he saw the Fulfillment of God's word after Jesus told him what was going to take place am but you know what he didn't do away with them he didn't reject them you know what even even in the midst of all the things that they done you know when when they had all their their faults and failures and problems you know God didn't turn turn away from them you know there in the in the scripture you know when when the when the Scripture it tells there when when the uh the man brought his son that was possessed of the devil and you know he and the disciples came and tried to cast him out and he said he said they and then the man brought him to Jesus and he's like hey Lord he said your disciples tried to cast out and you they couldn't but you know what he gave them he gave them the promise to cast out devils and you know he promised them and said that was the that was the word of God to them spoke to them listen y'all cast out Devils well you know what they did but he said see you know this this comes by prayer and supplication said this is more you couldn't do this but you know what it didn't do it like he didn't like brother said he didn't do away with the promise the promise was still there when they failed he didn't do away with it they still had that promise you still have the promise like brother Bram said he said God's power is given to you he said but it's limited by your faith right he said many times the problem is is he said he said we don't act on it he said because the power and the the word is given to us he said but we don't because sometimes we're afraid to act on it we're AF afraid to move up and do what God has given us the promise to do right but you know when when the disciples failed Jesus didn't say you know what he told him listen but he give them away listen this is what y'all got to do you got to grow it's it's growing amen it's a there's a there's a spiritual growth that's got to take place you know he didn't do away with them but he kept trying to grow and listen listen y'all coming to this place and all all the way through you know he began to talk to them about these things and you know they didn't understand all the things that he done you know just like you know he went by the had to go by the well one day and you know he was going to go by this you know maybe they didn't know what was going on but Jesus did there was there was a lady that had a hunger in her heart and you know what and nobody else really cared about her she was Outcast you know sometimes people didn't even want to look in her direction we we don't we don't want you we don't want to be seen with you we don't want to be associated with you we don't need you around but you know what she's exactly the one that would receive the word she is the one because brother R was talking about he said you know the Pharisees and all you know they heard all the scripture you they heard him speak and they seen the Miracles and everything like that and it's like he has a spirit he has an evil spirit he's bails you above y'all need to stay away from him you know there there there's no that you can't have anything to do with him and it's like but you know here he is doing all the things and he said look in the scripture am I not doing the full filling the scripture am I search the scriptures is this not what the scripture said would take place but here's this young this lady that that's had a hard life she went through all these things and here she is and and nobody gives her any account or anything in her life but you know she's out by the whale and Jesus is there waiting on her and it's like uh can I get a drink water well you know she's taken back by this you know here she is and then she begins to speak to him and he begins to speak to her and he begins to speak to her of the scripture and he realizes that she she believes the scripture which he already knew that but when she begins to speak of the scripture taking place of what was going to take place and he begins to converse with her on the scripture because she's looking for the Messiah also now nobody else gives her any credit for this but she's looking for it whether nobody else believes it or not she's got her own testimony and she tells Jesus her testimony and then all of a sudden he begins to speak to her and she says sir I perceive you're a prophet and he said because when the light flashed in front of her when the when the word came open her that she called and he began to speak to her and he began to speak to her situation of where she was living and everything and he began to meet her needs and then all of a sudden then she rose up when she was like well might I might share that with my neighbor you know I might I might share with the family when we're sitting around the dinner table I might um you know I might share it with a cooworker in passing no as soon as she got what she wanted when something took place in her and she had this Supernatural experience take place when she got a revelation of what was going on she dropped everything and she took off running right amen and you know she was sharing with everybody come see a man who told me everything about my life is this not the Messiah he you know she's sharing she's sharing with everybody whether anybody thought she was crazy or not she's letting everybody know why because it was something that was real to her something that stirred her Waters and it had moved in her life and she's going to let everybody know see see it's the same way see when when something takes place does it has it stirred you to the place where you're where you're bubbling and overflowing has it has it moved you to that place see because many times it's just like well you know we just we just go through the motions or whatever but no maybe that's what we need maybe that's what we need now is is to have our for God to stir us to the place you know we've got these some of y'all know what water softener tanks are it's got a BN the ones we have a lot of them have sand in them the ones we've got has got got a special resin it's like almost like sand that's in there and it's got all this rock in the bottom of just like pebbles it's all piled up and we're cleaning we've been trying to clean one out cuz we got to get it moved and put some new equipment in and everything so we've been working on trying to get this thing emptied well we just siphon the first thing you do is just fill it full of water put a hose in there start siphoning that thing up but you know after a while that thing gets so hard you can't do nothing with it it settles in the bottom it's been in there for years and you know what you're in there and it's got It's got a weeping system in the bottom of it so kind of like got all these it almost looks like kind of reminds you of like Roots it's got all these holes that sucks the water in well when you're trying to get that thing out it don't move I mean it's like you almost need a jackhammer in there trying to bust that stuff up but you know the first thing we do we go get a air hose and we get a tube we stick an air hose way down in the bottom of it and you know what we start doing we start stirring it up amen we got to get in there because you know that stuff just sits in there and it's set in there for so long it's so it's so settled it gets so packed in there and you know what you got to put something in there to get that thing stirred up cuz if you don't ever Stir It Up it ain't it'll never change there there's never there's never going to be a change take place and so you know that's what we we we spend hours just and you know it's so funny because you're down there and you're suctioning you're pouring water in you're suctioning it out and you're pushing that all that air blowing it up and it's just stirring all that stuff up and everybody's over there and they run over to the water and they start looking like we getting anything out oh yeah we're getting Pebbles getting stuff out but you know ever so often when you get in there you just you just keep going at it keep going at it but all of a sudden you'll hit the like the motherload and all of a sudden this stuff comes blowing out you just see all this water just come all this stuff coming out in the water and it's like man that's it right there now look we were actually moving something and so so sometimes that's what God wants to do with us why because we've set and we got settled for so long and sometimes we've got so seditary with in our waves that when God wants to move you know what it's like well brother Bob you go ahead brother I'll be right there no God's want you to stir your Waters and see if you're going to react to it not wait for somebody else it's like well you know if somebody else will run the aisles maybe I'll get behind them well you know what if you get if you get excited I think you ought to and you know everybody's like well you know what somebody's gonna say something well you know and everybody says well you know don't jump any higher than you can live well I I I I I just I just tell you you how how I say you know the the the problem because you know what everybody's like well you know you're all going to have faults you're all going to have problems you're all going to you're all going to make a mistake it's like oh we're waiting they ran the aisles oh look there got to write all this stuff down I can't believe you run the aisles and you that's right well you know you can't Point your finger at anybody else cuz you got the same kind of issues and it's the and the problem is says you know what because you know what if if if somebody Falls and and they have a issue or problems or whatever guess what the grace of God covers all of that and you know what if you go back and you look to see where you came from and to where you are today and you can't get excited then you know what I think we got a problem I think we ought to be in the Altar and if you can't see that somebody else can get happy about their salvation and you can't be a you know ridicule somebody about it you ought to be in the altar because I think you need to get right with God that you can't be excited for somebody else right you know when brother Brandon was watching that that young lady she was out there in the aisle she was dancing you know he was like you know his Baptist Doctrine just got too much inside of him but then of a sudden he got in the scripture and realized you know what that was a sign of Victory so well you know what when he got the victory too and realized you know what I can dance also well you know he went out there and joined her and it's the same way if God can move if God's done something for you then you know what you ought to be able to raise your hands and and and express what God has done for you and raise your hand and thank God and stand up and testify about it and if it causes you to move your feet then move your feet you know it's because you know we you know when when we were out in the world you know we didn't we didn't worry about we didn't have no condemnation about anything and you know what if we went somewhere and wanted to dance then you know what we just cut a rug is that not right I done I done I done the white man dance I had to like they said I had to I had the white man over bite but you know what when we want to dance we did it sure and you know what we didn't care what everybody else was thinking we were having a good time but you know what now it's like oh we better not do that we better not raise our hands we can't we you know the deacons might call us and have a have a conversation with us you know the pastor might call us into the study it's like no if you've done that sometimes say why a you done that sooner amen because if if God's real in your life and he's he's done something for you then we shouldn't worry about what everybody else thinks God is real and if he moves then guess what stand up and raise your hand somebody don't you come up here somebody raise your hands clap your hands do this that you don't have to do that if the if something's just like if something's bubbl up inside of you amen then release it amen as brother Wade always says let it out if it's on the inside let it out amen see come to that place where you can just let it out enjoy your salvation live your salvation to the fullest not have these things hold you back because you know what we've allowed the devil to hold us back for too long amen amen we we've allowed the devil to steal our joy and our peace and everything that that that comes with with the with the blessings of God which is our benefits and you know we've lived below our privileges for so long for too long and we ought to just enjoy them amen take these things and and live the the life enjoy your salvation see God has called us because you realize where you came from and what where you're going what God has done for you see when you see these things be rejoiced because when when something stirs when that light flashed across your path when you were in darkness and you see these things and even even today that you you'll be looking at something and all of a sudden the the holy spirit will move and it'll bring something to your remembrance he'll show you something in the scripture and all of a sudden something that you've looked at for years and all of a sudden it becomes clear to you and it's like well you know what I got I want to tell you something I can see this I understand these things why because you know we've probed at them and and looked at them and so so long it's like well I don't know if I'm ever going to get these things well you know because people look you know they they still struggle with you know the the the the word that they don't understand the seals they don't understand the 70 weeks of Daniel and all these things you know they struggle with these things that are in the scripture amen but the Bible says a real true eag will understand am that's what the pro the prophet you know what I'm just going to take the prophet at his word he brought it to you and for us to understand these things it's like well you know what if it takes if it takes me forever that's all right I'm going to keep on fighting I'm gonna keep on pressing and you all of a sudden you you you look at things like well I don't understand that I don't understand that people say things and it's it's so confusing I don't and all of a sudden when it comes to you and it opens up and you real it's like it's so simple and I don't understand how I didn't see that but one of these days you realize you know what it's God's Sovereign time in his time he opens these things up he begins to reveal his word to you see it's it's by by God's grace the light shines across your path and you're because you're a Child of Light and you begin to see the light of God's word and it begins to open up to you and you know what he has more light for you to walk in you know I'm I don't know if I've ever told this I've shared it with a few people but I don't know if I've ever shared this publicly or not but you know I was I was thinking about years ago I was talking to brother Dale and you know I i' had a I had this dream and I was walking in light but it wasn't it wasn't bright light it was almost like dusk but I there was light I was walking in and I began to walk and I got to a point where the light started to go away and I just kept walking and walking and I got into darkness and I was walking down this path and I got to the place where I was by myself and I was in this darkness and I come to this place and I realized you know what I'm going the wrong way and I turned around and I started walking the way from where I was walking and I didn't know where I was going to walk but the only thing I could see in the distance was the light and it started like the sun was coming up and I to walk toward that and I kept on walking I kept on walking and I got to a place brother Bob where when I got to the when I got into this area it was like I was walking into the sun and it was just like this you couldn't imagine the the amount of light that was shining in this place it was so bright and it was like I was amazed that I wasn't blinded by it but I just kept kept walking in that light and you know it just kept growing and growing it was just increasing it was just amazing and I just felt like I was walking right into the sun it just kept going and going and going and you know I was telling brother Dale one day I was telling about my dream and he told me he said just walk in the light because you know you wherever you're at and you come to a place and realize you're not walking where you ought to be when you get on the right path just keep walking right and you know there in the Scripture it tells us that you know he said he said that there would come a day you know the the the light the sun would shine as seven times there in the scripture in the Old Testament you know you'd see this light and you know it was so bright and you just kept walking in it but you know that's what God has called us to you know because whe whether how light you think how bright you think the light is and you think well I'm walking in light or I can't attain to that you know if you just keep walking in God if you just keep walking in God you no matter where you go you you think well I can't attain to that you just keep walking and see if God don't bring you to that place he just you just keep walking and it just keeps getting brighter and brighter and brighter and you know you think well I I I can't get to that place or or you know I I'll never get there you you just keep walking in the light that you're in right now because if God has called you and he puts you on the right path then you know what it'll just continue to get brighter and brighter and brighter and you know you just keep walking because you know what that same light that you're walking in today will continue to grow and it'll take you right to a body change the light is here and all you got to do is walk in it and when the light shines in your in in your pathway and it begins to light you just keep walking in that light and you know what because one of these days it becomes so great you're like wow but you know what that's what God wants us to do to walk in that light many times we we look at ourselves and we we don't realize what God has done for us and sometimes our our problem is not looking at ourselves but looking at what God said about us walk in the light as he's in the light continue to walk I pray it's been a blessing to you let's all stand have the musicians come continue to walk in that light let's sing that tonight we'll walk in the light the beautiful light come where the do drops of Mercy are bright if you've got if you've got confusion you got darkness in your life you got
