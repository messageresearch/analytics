today you have your uh Bibles you can go ahead and turn to Genesis 1 and we'll make a few announcements I'll put the board up when all the when the older musicians get out of the way oh man turn around Shake somebody's hands say God bless you boy you really didn't mean that turn around saying God bless you and just keep doing that while I'm doing this this I said keep doing that till I finish this thank you some of you are doing it some of you are not that's that sounds good Lord bless you everyone bless your heart appreciate you that's it can you see that in the back halfway decent if not we'll have it on the on the uh on the video so we kind of fixed it up all right it's kind of scrabbled up a little bit but it'll be okay Genesis 1 26 and 27 now uh by the way I have a couple announcements November the 2nd remember the um Fall Festival I talked to Dad the other day we're going to uh have a tournament and we're gonna have a BB gun tournament we're going to take we're going to get a couple BB guns and some of you want to uh we'll do it with girls and guys and we'll have a tournament and whoever wins we may just give them the BB gun so so we'll see about that but we're gonna have a little tournament and then everybody else can play games and whatever but I think we ought to have a little have a hard little shooting class no not your sister Brenda no no honey no it's for the younger ones not the ones that think they're young okay not those so just it's for the kids yeah thank you also remember Brother house said remember brother Rick everybody remembers brother Rick that used to come here he wants everybody to pray for him um from what I gather the information I got was that uh that Rick really saw something different than us and he wanted us to pray for him so so whatever shape he's in whatever he's done in the past you know he's still a child to God okay so let's just keep him in the prayers also another announcement um brother Boyd's class now he's getting a pretty good pretty good group in there 10 or 10 or 11. uh young adults from probably 10 or 12 up to 18 19 years old and he wants to tell you parents now remember one thing your parents had these kids right okay and brother Randall said you are their Holy Ghost until they get the Holy Ghost right it's not their decision what to do amen that's not the doctrine of this church that's not the doctrine of the Bible and that's not you I never heard brother Brown say that that kid can decide what he wants to do whenever he wants to do it no way now when he leaves and goes out of the house he can do whatever he wants to do but if he comes to this church he's going to do what the church has the rules of the church right nobody brought their Bible to his Sunday school class no kid brought their Bible to a Sunday school class when you come to Sunday school class kids bring your Bible amen amen parents tell your kids to bring the Bible one dead I'm sorry I wonder who did Michael did well praise the Lord the good Michael's going foreign but nine others didn't all right so let's shoot for 100 but you know really you do have to be the kids Holy Ghost you can't let them just do what they want to do all right so you are their Holy Ghost and you know what you're responsible until they decide to go somewhere else daddy told me one time he said son if you live in my house I don't care if you're 30 years old he said if you put your feet under my table see exactly what he said you put your feet under my table and you eat my food you're gonna do what I ask you to do that's just respect I mean that's that's the Bible That's The Prophet's message and that's what this church upholds so you are the Holy Ghost and you are responsible for your kids so that's with them going outside and playing that's with all the other things that goes on around here so don't think you can bring any other kind of Doctrine in this church because you can't do it all right we won't allow it but Genesis 1 26 and 27 I think that's all the announcements we have but just bring bring your Bibles it really helps brother boy because it helps me when when when the adults when where everybody's got their Bible and they're all we're doing responsive reading and it just really helps the teacher instead of him going well I'll tell you what the Bible says it's a lot better for you to read that's why we're going to do this and that's why we're going to do this all right because visual does help Genesis 1 26 and 27. let's bow our heads before we get started do you have any father we pray Lord today that you will come Among Us in a special way lead us and guide us by the Holy Spirit be the preeminent one Lord in the service and father you you do the speaking be the active participant Lord for need to hear the sick Lord we ask you to send the word and heal them now for anything going on now in their body Lord or or anything Lord that you just heal them now father take care of them Lord we know you're the Healer you're the Redeemer you're the all in all father we pray now that you take care of us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit let it be the preeminent one in our life not just here Lord but in our homes and in our jobs and the things that we do Lord we pray that you just sanctifies Lord for our journey be with us and bless the ones that are not here the ones that are sick Lord be with sister Anna Canard but allow the ones that are home Lord we ask just to be with them Lord bless the ones that are watching in we pray now Lord that everything will be done for your honor and glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all right this is going to be a study on Genesis 1 26 and 27 of course most of you know me that's my favorite scripture and one I like to talk about and I was telling sister Trudy to science she was asking me about something I said don't ask me I said we'll talk about this afternoon but Dad and I really don't talk about these things as far as that goes as far as he's going to preach on this and I'm going to preach on that but this is really kind of kind of woven in and I'm sure he'll get to it and do a better job but I'm going to give you just a little bit of taste of what I see that's that helps me to understand because look brother Branham is not confused the Bible is not confused right right but you can take a two Soul Doctrine seven tons of virtue Doctrine perusia Doctrine son of man all those different doctrines and they have quotes to back that Doctrine up they get it from the message then they put their own interpretation to it like I was telling June the other day you you've got we've got this great message we've got this great picture like brother Brown said you've got a picture and you got a cow you've got the grass and you've got the tree so we have the message the Bible all those things to come together right right but now what if you got the cow eating grass in the top of the tree you got all the components you need for a beautiful picture but you've just misplaced that right word picture okay and that's just as bad all right that's not having the picture at all because you're deceiving the people so brother Brown was not deceived he is not if he changed the doctrine he changed it right right we don't need to change anything of his all right so we're not changing any doctrines like brother down said he quoted before brother Brown said I'm here to straighten out doctor not to make a new one but to straighten out the old one all right so listen let's read this and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness now that word image I'm going to get into something maybe later on I've been doing a little study of the DNA of God or the DNA of the Holy Ghost because that's what we're talking about today the seed of God not a natural seed but there is a the reason I act like I do is because I have the DNA of my parents so blame them but really the what I have but you can't see my DNA but you see what it displays okay so the Holy Ghost has a DNA God has a DNA all right God is DNA that's what he is he is the life strand but that's what that image because if we were born in the image of a dog we'd look like a dog but we were born in the image of God right all right after our lightness and let them plural have dominion over the fish of the Sea and the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth it didn't say some of the earth it said all the Earth all right and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image not another image in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them you may be seated in the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word and we're gonna we're going to look at the chart and I want you as I read and we we're gonna you're gonna have to don't look crop side but put one eye over here and one eye over here because I'm going to read you some quotes and we're going to look at the chart and we're going to see how that that if you'll notice if you can't see from the back this part here this is the fall you've heard of a fall line right this is the fall line this was above the fall and this is below the fall all right after the fall yeah all right so Genesis 1 26 and 27. now watch I want to show you the characteristics that I see and then I'm going to let brother Branham prove what I see all right Genesis 1 26 and 27 is the theophany of God amen amen amen it's the logos right the reason we can create a world and go live on it that lives in us right right if you're born again word form right right is that we're okay with this all right Christ right we're getting a lot less say man's hair creator because remember Genesis 1 26 and 27 is like Dad said as I was explaining um to Sister Trudy God is a Creator but it says in the beginning of the creation of God there is no creation of God in the form that we see where there's nothing then there's something right a car is a creation of man right but the components of that car was in the Garden of Eden that's right everybody got that right so a car was created out of the Earth but it was always there okay so now look at creation of that now watch but we we look at eternity and Elohim now we're coming down to think of all the background here foreknowledge this says predestinated not predestination hold on a man all right because remember predestination looks back to foreknowledge predestinated is a promise yes predestinated before the foundation world that is stamp that is settled that is done all right so now theophany of God the logos word form Christ Creator seed of God Amen okay Galatians 3 16. all right man not seasons of many not as a natural Abraham seed but as of what one seed which is Christ all right so now and this part of God always was eternal right not born on a certain day you remember in the quote right and it's a seed amen amen it's sinless man amen has no beginning and has no end okay that's what Genesis 1 26-27 man is in a nutshell you can put bride in there and you can put the children of God but that's exactly what that is all right but now look that was a part of God are the an amorphy of God that he was coming to because we were supposed to come through Adam and Eve come down through Adam and Eve and actually this was in Adam and Eve right okay you're not asleep yet this was in Adam and Eve all right because he was to he had the ability to bring us all into being had there not been a fall right okay now look let's read now let's start with number one and before we get started let me read this it's not up here but let me read this from the future home uh dad quoted it the other night but let me read it exactly brother around them on the future home this is 1964. after the seals was open right he's talking about paragraph 78 he led he led us to himself to a Tabernacle in Us by three stages of Grace just like he led the world in three stages to come to the world as God will come to the world after it's gone through three different stages of purification that's exactly how he comes to us through three stages of Grace I taught that at the beginning I've never changed since it's God's word so brother Branham did not and I talked to a guy not too long brother a lot too long ago that said that brother Brown changed his way of the new birth after the seals open no I say you got a greater revelation we all do audition but he didn't change the way you're born again you can't change because look the last quote he said he says it's God's word so you can't change God's word brother Brown didn't come to change God's word he came to make it more plain what we can realize where we come from and where we're going back to okay I come from this now I'm going back to this I come from God I'm going back to God very simple but you got to take the quote that brother Branham gives and I'm going to give you some quotes that seem maybe a little different I once was a kookaburra now I'm a wheat right I once was lost but now I'm found but I always was eternal if I have eternal life okay I wasn't born on no certain day you were not Sons you got it by the by the birth you were already in this form but you got to remember I'll read you a quote in a minute where brother Brown said your eternal life begins at the altar now was he that confused I don't think so it's the mind of man that's confused trying to that's what I'm saying about quotes quotes will kill you without a revelation uh they can quote you to death with the the seven Thunders the the paruges the two Soul doctrines where'd they get it from they got it from quotes in the message same way with what Dad was saying this morning about father son Holy Ghost and Lord Jesus Christ they're both there they're both quotes in the Bible but it takes a revelation to put them together so now number one this is questions and answers on Genesis 19 53. now if God created man in his own image and his own likeness what kind of man did he create a spirit man all right now it's Genesis 1. that's what he's talking about all right now if you'll notice after he had made all the creation and created a spirit man the close reading of this now to the ones asked the question will find this that God give dominion to the cattle fish and everything to the man but in his making up there he made him in made man in his own image to lead the cattle lead the beasts of the field just like the Holy Spirit leads the Believers today and I want to tell you something that is the Holy Spirit that is the Holy Ghost okay now he was in other words Adam the first man in the lower creations of God the first creation was God himself now God is the creator he can't create himself in the form we want to think that he created himself it's like he was nothing and then he was here it's like the analogy and some of you are new and and and have not seen this before but if you condemn these lights down to where all you could see was just my form just imagine for just a moment you you all the lights are dim and all you see is a dark form but you raise the lights up a little bit now I haven't changed but you don't know whether I'm white or black green purple orange but as the light comes on more you maybe see that hey he's a lighter colored man oh he's a man oh he's got black hair used to be Danny don't say a word you got enough on that side of you over there but you see what I'm saying I I always was a man a human white -headed but you didn't see it in that way you only saw a form am I making sense but as the light comes on you see more of my features as the light comes on you're going to see more of my features okay all right so you're going to see more of me that's why in the in the end time the light is the brightest it's ever been but it's so small because it's only a small amount of people that's going to see the full light and realize who they were now I realize this is me but I realized that was me I don't know about you but when I was doing the things of the world I wasn't thinking about God now he was thinking to me he had me right here but I wasn't thinking of him I was lost doomed and on my way to hell because if you look right here brother Branham never took free moral agency and choice out of his quotes all the way up to 1965. man is put on free moral agency so don't tell me you don't have a choice but God knew the choice you would make therefore he can make a choice you know God made a choice brother Dale read it this morning he had a plan and a purpose ain't had a choice right he chose what to do all right so now the first creation was God himself in other words he was starting to unveil what he what he was not what he was going to be but what he was what he always was all right then out of God came to logos which was the son of God then out of the logos which was the word now watch he's talking about Genesis 1 26 man because if you'll read the quote up above it then out of the logos which was the word in the beginning was the word words with God and Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us out of the logos came forth the man right so logos was the Genesis 1 26 man that's what he said right here out of the logos came the man right number two you'll like the way I colored this up they didn't do that I did kind of cute huh okay let's go let me before we go any further this is adoption 1960. brother Brown I'm on the adoption series I don't care if it was before the seals or after the seals that was the adoption series he was trying to bring people to a place all right so the same way I told them when we were talking about Daniel 70 weeks uh I drive a I drive a Volvo now if something's wrong with my Volvo I don't want to go buy uh uh a book about a Ford I wouldn't buy a book about a Ford anyway book about a Ford to fix my Volvo right right that's why they were saying oh well you need to take this Daniel 70 weeks book and chunk it out of the way and just take what he said after the seals now a man spent three services same thing on the adoption series he spent service after service and he was wrong come on people good grief you just can't put the word together short drives you crazy let me before we go any further go back Genesis 1 26 I'll pick it up Wednesday when God made man before he made man he called himself llh Ella Elohim the word means in the Hebrews the self-existing all by himself nothing existed before him he was all the existence there ever was amen self-existent one L Elohim means the all-sufficient all-powerful almighty self-existing one all right now look he's still talking about Genesis 1. 26 and 27 because watch his next quote but in Genesis 2. now he didn't make spirit man in Genesis too he made flesh man in Genesis 2. right and put the spirit man into the flesh man so he's talking about even the self-existing God just like uh I don't have it up here but I was going to write it I had it in my notes but I didn't put it up there 30 times in the Book of Genesis the word God is used which is Elohim right which in Genesis 1 26 and 27 God God God God God then in Genesis 2 7 it says Lord God which is what he's talking about now Yahoo j-u-v-u-h Yahweh or Jehovah because now it's a self-existing one that has a family but now he he made a part of himself before the Genesis 2 man he made a part of himself but he was still self-existing I'm gonna let that soak in because this is not a separate part of him it's more of him that you can see and understand okay so the Genesis 1 man even in its plurality created he them right right in in that plurality of that creation or unfolding he steals God self-existing all by himself because it's him right okay but now but in Genesis 2 when he made man he said I am y-a-h-u-j-u-v-u-h yahu yahuwah Jehovah what did it mean I am the all-existent one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or amateur little one of mine Oh Glory why he gave him Jehovah means he gave man to be an amateur God because he is the father God and he made a man an amateur God so he isn't self-existing anymore he exists with his family now that's Genesis 2 when he put that one 26th man into the 2-7 man to walk on the Earth right all right everybody got that say amen amen all right Ella Ella Elohim now now he is Jehovah Jehovah means the one who exists with his family right all right so there was a there was a creation of God an unfolding of God or a revelation of God not separate to God it's God in morphing God in another form all right and then we know if you've been around here long enough you know that when that 126 man was put in the 2-7 man and given three moral agency that's when like what brother Dale was on this morning that's when man fell right all right and there was no way because this was sinless No Beginning No End eternal didn't know a thing about sin because it's God now how could this supersede this listen hang on a minute how could this supersede this one in Genesis 3 he said I'll put enmity right there's a block there and God put it there he used to walk with Adam and Eve just like I would walk with my wife just walk right down through the garden and just talk to him now what happened after that there's no other way that God could do that again except come back and we'll talk about that in a minute through the atonement because what's the first thing he done kill the ant kill the animals right through the skins in what making an atonement all right but he'd already made the atonement back up here right amen so it was all covered Lamb slain before the foundation of the world see this is all before the foundation of the world right here all right so now let's go to number three the Messiah 1961. now Isaiah 9 6. we just want we just won't read it but he was to be the Everlasting father of the Mighty God when God made man in Genesis 1 26 it shows if you put a scripture down Genesis 1 26 it shows that God made man to be a God to begin with man was made to be God a Lesser God he was made in the image and likeness of God he had had what he had hands like God he had feet like God eyes ears and intelligence like God right right Amen to that listen to this his whole fiber that means all from head to toe his whole fiber because he was a Son of God and the Jesus referred to him as God remember Jesus comes and says hey hey can you contem condemn me have sinned when it says that your prophets are Gods roll it up to get the end of the quote here just reading the blue for the same time and in Genesis 1 26 when God made man he made him a God because he gave him a dominion and he had rulership all right which is the Earth all right is that correct gave him dominion and rulership now let's go to number four questions and answers on Genesis back 1953 that's a good one to uh listen to or read if you want to study some more about Genesis 1. all right now the first man now he made the first man in His image and we're returning back to that image amen come from here going back to here actually this come here it didn't stay up in glory this came here all right we'll get into that in a minute if we have time because this is a study on Genesis 1. we won't finish it today we finish it maybe later on but we're returning back to that image what the image God created where the whole fiber all that quote up above there the whole fiber everything about that person is God that's right to our first created image Genesis 1. when God created me William Branham I was before the foundation of the world he made my being my spirit right now remember this is 1953 brother Brown flip-flop spirit and soul right right he said he said that the spirit was the inside realm Faith or doubt and then when he changed that it's still Faith or doubt so he made my being my spirit I wasn't conscious of anything as far as I know of you see you understand you didn't know but see now we know that's why we can look at job where the sons of God shouted for joy we can look back through the word we can look back where we came from exactly and say yeah I was shouting up there because I was in the DNA of the Almighty okay we'll get into something in a minute but I wasn't conscious of anything as far as I know of but I was there now not the William Branham that came here The Flash William Branham that wasn't back there but if your soul ever was eternal if you had a new birth it was back there okay because when in Genesis 1 that's what he created all right oh I don't believe you're getting it but now just a minute Jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation in the world and Paul said here that he chose us in him see in him before the world began now there was some part of me Orman Neville and the rest of you all here that's in Jesus Christ before the world ever begun amen absolutely if you have eternal life that eternal life was there Amen in the DNA of God not you as a person there was no way you could find me or Terence or Anna in my daddy at any one time except for one time but it had to take an act to get us here right but whatever DNA He Is We Are same way with God the only thing with Dad and Mom they didn't know how many kids they were going to have if they did it only had one or two maybe but the middle one tell you what we keep singing that birthday song just a little bit more I can't believe he deceived them kids into doing that but anyway what was I talking about oh DNA but I was but now you can take his DNA in My DNA and prove that I was in him somewhere what do you say some part of me got it was in him when he was a kid because it's a DNA strain not just a little excuse my language the little sperm right everybody got that so it's not that it's what come from here you were in your great great grandfather what in DNA not in right right sperm or germ or whatever it's in gene form and we've got to be reading this was our generation right here this was our gening of God but it got lost and we got to be regioned who was that Paul said follow me in the Regeneration what were you saying we're trying to get back up here and that don't mean up here that means back to that right everybody got that say Amen okay so uh you know I just and if anybody sees this uh you know the the situation we had a few weeks ago where I preached somewhere else and of course they didn't agree with what was going on but you know I I can't I'm not gonna fight people and argue or it doesn't do a bit of good to do that it's just sitting there throwing quotes at each other you know if you don't have a revelation that's what I told him downstairs not a reflection of of just because Dad's my dad but there's not many preachers in this message this is going out wherever there's not many preachers that I know of I can't name many that can take seemingly the quotes that are contrary and the quotes that they use or whoever uses to produce a false Doctrine can be brought together and made a beautiful picture I can't I don't see people doing that I see this group of people using their quotes and throwing the rest out but we've got a pastor that takes the quotes over here and the quotes over here that seems odd or different and shows how that they can come together well what a great thing to have and to me it just takes care of all the confusion because you know what brother Branham did say some things to confuse people you know what the Bible said and now what scripture says to confuse the wise and prudent right to confuse people he had brother he has us say things brother Brown said he'd let a brother say something kind of off to you to see how you'd react to it now that's pretty strong to see how you would react not even not anything on the brother but he's one that's seemingly wrong and he won't see how you react to it that's brotherly kindness we ain't got to do that yet now there was some part of me Orman Neville and the rest of y'all here that's in Christ Jesus not identities in Christ in Christ before the world ever began and here's to my analysis of that I think that the people today that are possessed with this Spirit or the spirit a part of these Angelic beings Spirits which rotated off of God that never fell in the beginning and resisted the devil's lie in heaven now he keeps going on down I cut a little bit of that out for save time but what she says right here there's the whole plan laying right there how God created me in the beginning watch created me in the beginning not me in the beginning got it my mom and dad give me this right God give me this okay all right and that was before that always was eternal that never sin that never had a day it was bad or a day that was good it was always good all right there's the whole plan how God created me in the beginning I came down here on the Earth taken my place as a gospel preacher are you as a man or woman to Salvation not that you came here always Eternal or that you came here like he was talking about here he says he said you came here I came taken my place as a gospel preacher or you as a man or woman to Salvation when you live the life by the grace of God Hallelujah and that same Spirit leaves here that was back there in the beginning I'll go back to the conscience of knowing I've been here hallelujah because those people in that sixth dimension told Brother random what he was on Earth so they didn't lose their consciousness of Earth after they'd already passed on right they actually picked up more knowledge right they picked up more knowledge of being on the Earth all right I'll go I'll go back to the conscious of knowing I've been here hallelujah and then wait there unto the altar blessed forever and rest and then when returning back I take up my body in its very peak of best before death ever Struck it all right so there's the plan of it somewhere in God I was created and if I'm down here just playing something different I wasn't here right right all right or I don't have this yet right because see he put the enmity the division the death the separation that's all happened in Genesis 3. after what happened with the even the Beast and after what happened with Even Adam God said I'll put enmity you're going to do this you're going to do that another Covenant came into being but death came into being no death up here death came into being separation came into being in sin now tell me how you're going to come here with all with eternal and have all that I was reading the other day where brother or went to the quote where brother Brown said the unclean Spirit goes out of sanctification right if you always was eternal and you were born with eternal life like I heard a preacher say how you gonna put something clean and something unclean or something unclean or something clean no I just like to believe we're lost I just like to believe that I was dead I was on my way to hell and somebody somebody came by my way and you know what I accepted that call you know God comes calling we don't go looking for God he comes calling but you know what he's going to call everybody if he doesn't he's a respecter of persons right he's going to call somewhere and you're going to make a choice because there's no judgment without choice right there's no judgment there's no reason to have a judgment seat there's no reason for Christ to die on a cross because he took the judgment of me on itself to get that unclean out and put some clean in suring the plan and in the and then the foreknowledge and I'm trying to pick my words right into in the mind of God this down here didn't happen remember there's a blood covering right if God saw us now in this condition that I've killed every one of us but remember the blood so if we come here always Eternal why do we need the blood cover I don't I just don't understand that I just want to be lost and found what greater God than just somebody going I'm going to pull you through a tube and I'm going to make you do this sure God's Sovereign God can do whatever he wants to do but God chose to do it this way and his foreknowledge is because of the choice we made down here that's just you know what it's too simple it's too simple for a mind that thinks way up here to just think so simple how that yeah I was lost and some great supreme Supreme Being came and gave me a part of his life right get to turn your phone off geez that time for me to quit or what okay thank God we won't need them things when we get over there hey you know why you know that's a pre-figure television is a vision what do you think brother Brown was looking at what do you think Moses were looking at when he looked back in the Garden of Eden God had a camera somewhere what which was his intelligence his eyes God saw what happened in Genesis and he just took it over and said Moses look what happened turn to channel five and you'll pick up what happened well I believe what Moses saw what happened don't you I mean he just didn't write down I believe he had a vision like brother Bradham had a vision he said I see you as an older person what was he looking through right Big Brother ain't got nothing on Jesus Christ thank you You Can't Hide a little bit from Big Brother but you can't hide from big God I'll go back to the conscious of knowing I've been here hallelujah and then wait there under the altar bless forever and rest and then return back I take up my body and it's very peak of best before death ever Struck it all right so we got that now let's go to number five this is questions and answers on Hebrews 1957. that's Genesis 1 where he created man in his own image which was in see I'm trying to get the quote so it'll prove he calls Genesis 1 26 man what theophany all right theophany of God right and in Genesis 2 he made Man Out of the Dust of the earth which was a human man that we have now and then there was a fall and he keeps going through but let's go to number six Hebrews chapter four I want to read a few of these quotes and then we'll make some comments but I want you to make sure that I just didn't pull these out of the out of my hat somewhere just think of it is there two eternal life this is 1957 Hebrews chapter four you couldn't answer that could you there is one eternal life and that's the life of God this other kind of life no matter what it is it's got to have an end to it so there is two lives right okay you got your natural life in the spiritual life all right kind of simple anything that had a beginning has to happen in but anything that had no beginning right has no end and God said he would give us give us eternal life without beginning we were just made a part of him and actually the life that's in US wasn't brought here by human nature now that does away with the natural birth are you having anything by the natural birth you're born dead I'll read it here in just a second nature gives us a spirit but that Spirit died and we got the spirit of God right now where you got always was eternal in there that spirit of God always was eternal but you weren't glory to God was God a man certainly let us make man in our own image what was God a theophany a body and their man was made like that and put Over the Garden but there was no man in the till the soil in the senses then he created man Out of the Dust of the Earth in the animal life and that man till the soil and man fell by transgression correctly and God the theophany God's a theophany look over here saying God the theophany done what all this came in Christ Jesus Christ okay all this there wasn't a part of this that stayed up here when Christ came this all came he's the sinless one he had no beginning or no end what was inside of him you got it he was the theophany of God right he was the logos you are the creator of God he was word form one more time he was word form he came according to what the word said he was word form that's why he said before he could say before Abraham was I am you and I can't say that not in the form we're in now all right but in word form he knew all things I'll read it quote in a minute this was Christ because remember he was Jesus Christ there was a lot of Jesus's but he was Jesus Christ when he was born all right he was born he was a Creator he was the seed of God he was that one seed which is Christ he always was eternal he wasn't born on a certain day the Christ Jesus the man was but to Christ all right and he was the seed of God absolutely no doubt all right now look in the beginning was the word this too strong for you that you think you know I had to stay I thought well Genesis 1 26 was just the eternal life that God puts in me at the at the new birth and and I'm a Child of God well you're all that too dick that's why you can go create a world you know what and this is what the Lord showed me the other day I told him I told him down in the uh Sunday school class I said I had to get a new lawnmower because the one I was on took a rapture because I was preaching to it and it just went out of here and I gotta have to get another one but now I can do some real real thinking on those things especially when you got a big yard and you don't have to go around anything you just go back and forth actually a little mundane to people but not to me I can sit there and think but all this right here the reason we understand what we understand in this end time and brother Brown is going to tell you he's going to say thank God for the opening of those seals why because all this now Wesley had all this Luther had all this Paul had all this but he never said in the scriptures that you are the theophany of God did he did he ever explain this word logos did he but we buy the new birth and the revelation of the opening of all the word not just part of it all the word we can look right back up and see that all this is in here and each characteristic brings itself that's how we're going to get a new body it's not the one that was created by Mom and Daddy you say you gotta we got to create a new body no but to create her inside of us it's not going to just read Gene the soul he's going to Regine the jeans that Mom and Daddy gave you that's my brother Brown said I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Branham what he saw that he was being regenerated by the almighty not by his mom and daddy all right now look actually the life that was that where I was at was God a man certainly let us make man our own image what was God a theophany of body and their man was made like that and put Over the Garden but there's no man to till the soil in the senses then he created man Out of the Dust of the Earth the animal life and that man till the soul and when man fell by transgression correctly and God the theophany came down and was made flesh and dwelt Among Us to do what redeem means to bring back all right the man excuse me now let's go to number seven the seed shall not be aired with a shot 1965 429 B all right he was gone to logos the word that went out of God he began to brood upon the Earth and brought forth marine life now that's us that's us hey it just says around here low gospel watch Genesis 1 26. brother Brown said we were little creators what did he mean by that we just haphazardly just think about something no there's a Creator living in US all right when the bride realizes who she is and what she's doing here we're realizing now I think what we're doing here and what is already in us not what's coming but it's already in us all right now when the spirit of God the log gospel word which God said let there be and there went the logos which is the word because see brother Dale's going to get to to Genesis 1 26 Genesis 1 26 is placed in the sixth day but Genesis 1 26 and 27 was before the foundation of the world so the logos in the form of the logos he could say Let There be let there be Let There Be Right all right same way with you and I how in the world are we going to how in the world did Brother Brown speak squirrels into existence had to be a Creator in there somewhere because human man can't do it same way with brother Ram said limbs would be restored dead would be raised how are you going to do that there's got to be Creator already in there all right now where were they Let There Be and there went the logos which is the word and the word began to cause all this was in the logos which is the word right the whole word of God the whole Bible for every age and as the logos began to breathe upon the Earth there came marine life and building up the bird life on up to animal life and finally there comes something in the representation or looked like the thing that was brewing it one more time looked like the thing that was brewing it we were created in His image that means the exact likeness okay and we're not a separate person so that eternal life that we have had to be there doing this or there's two forms of eternal life okay it'll sink in one of these days and finally there comes something in the representation or looked like the thing that was brewing it brooding over it God a man in the very image of God that man fell like the seed has to fall and then God began to brood over that after the fall he brought up Enoch Elijah Moses Prophet after prophet and finally upon the Earth came the genuine image of God himself which was gone the logos made flesh all this made flesh and dwelt Among Us now that same logos he's not finished now that same logos has a part he's got a bride give me that he's got a bride he didn't stop in Christ because he said the logos made flesh and dwell Among Us he could have stopped right there now that same logos has a part he has got a bride in the same logos this word that cannot be tampered with is brooding over the churches today trying to bring back the word to its full manifestation hmm got it the denominations have been carriers to what they were holding the seed but the seed is here all right let's go to number eight now number eight is who is this Melchizedek 1965. now we're going to stop here for just a second because we got to kind of breathe a minute and remember what all we said over here because in who is this Melchizedek I believe brother random lays it out how we come here what form and all those things that that some people must not be able to understand because they got us here because remember if you were born with eternal life in you you come word form Jesus came word form because why he had eternal life in him when he was born right he wasn't born Jesus and then became Christ on the River Jordan he was born Emmanuel God With Us he was born the Christ he was born Lord God he was born hello he he was all of it didn't have to become it he was it so he come with this in him all right but remember now let's read this now we see the attribute sons of his spirit and that's us we're the attributes of God right brother Dale's been preaching on the attributes of God that's who we are right now we see the attribute sons of his Spirit have not yet entered into the word form body right so how can we have eternal life in our soul before we were born again exactly you can't there's no way you can't change scripture but a theophany this body is subject to the word and Earnest waiting for the earnest change of the body now what he's talking about is this is not in word form this didn't come word form I told you boy sister Anna Moringa bless her heart she about flipped out one day when I told him that this was born anti-word so this was Antichrist she said no no no no no I said yeah yeah tell me this was born according to the word was it so was Santa it's Antichrist this is anti-word this did not come according to the word of God the true word did it didn't come like this was supposed to come okay so this is all anti this is all against God God never had sex in his mind he didn't have sex in his mind he permitted sex but he didn't have sex in his mind God's not that way remember the spoken word is the Original Seed the spoken word was to bring this forth because that's the original way that God wanted not through the loins of a man but he permitted it because of what because of a choice that somebody made you were born between Satan and Eve doomed lost and on your way to hell and if you don't believe it just look at yourself if we hang around here another five years or one year I got muscle that hurt that I didn't know I had muscles there and I'm 53 so anyway but it's theophany this body is subject to the word we are we're subject to the word what's inside of us is the word but it's this becomes subject to the word what I used to do I don't do anymore why because I'm subject to the word that's in me not what I was born with what I was born with was a carnal nature so were you brother Brown said everybody from Adam was born the same way from Adam was born the same identical way there's not one person came any different except for Jesus Christ and he had to come through that channel had to come through the womb right to clean it out because that's where it all happened in the garden we know it was up here first but we know the other part was not clean that's why that happened see in the fall Satan knew he couldn't create this Satan couldn't create anything but he took this the flesh man and perverted that flesh man perverted his mind therefore it came down to where then Eve's womb was polluted naturally by the seed of a beast so God couldn't come through something unclean anymore but her mind was the first thing that was not clean God if it was going to be a spoken word it wasn't going to have to be from the other part you understand what I'm saying it was spoken ever how it was supposed to come it was supposed to be spoken word not a literal sex act all right so but when the literal sex act came there's no other way then God could come the way he wanted to right this is all elementary but it's part of this so he couldn't come so what did uh preacher the other day said uh made a good comment he said Satan couldn't create a son of his own so he stopped the Son of God from being born because see you know what when God was talking about this right here Satan was standing right there with him he wasn't off on vacation somewhere he wasn't out of church he was in church when God said this so he knew the principles of life because of the animals and then of course then when God when God put us in flesh which was animal flesh then he knew we would fall because you know what he knew what Satan would do Satan would head right toward that all right so now look at this milk as in now the difference between him and you as a son he was at the beginning the word he's talking about Jesus Christ an amorphy body he came in and lived in that and the person of Melchizedek then later we never heard no more of melchized it because he became Jesus Christ Melchizedek was the priest but he became Jesus Christ Melchizedek had the same soul that Jesus had but Melchizedek was not born of a woman right so he couldn't be our brother right right he was a high priest but he couldn't be our brother Jesus had to be born through the womb of a woman to be our brother very human he was Melchizedek had a human body but he was not human and when he was never a baby all right Melchizedek was full-grown man walked up to Abraham he didn't have to grow up like Jesus did all right because now Jesus is our brother because he was a baby and he grew up Melchizedek was the priest but he became Jesus Christ because in that form he knowed all things and you have never been able now if I was born with eternal life I'd have to know something because now that I'm born again I know what I can go back to and be able to realize in my even in my carnal mind even in my carnal mind come on we can understand the things of God why because God's in us trying to work his way back out all right now because in that form you know all things and you have never been able now you bypass that you bypass look you bypass over here you bypass this and you came human form you bypass coming the way you were supposed to come that's what he just said right read it over there you bypass that to know that yet you come like Adam like me you become from the attribute to flesh to be tempted now why do we need to be tempted if we already got eternal life but when this life is finished here if this Earthly timeline will be dissolved we have one already waiting there's where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we done now we don't understand it we have never become the word we've just become the flesh man not the word now he's talking about this guy all right because remember watch what he keeps going but look but and look clearly makes it clear you will never be the word unless you were a thought at the beginning by what for knowledge got it that proves the predestination of God see look here predestinated is a promise there's going to be a predestinated bride you choose whether you are part of it or not right but down here you see predestination is what Destiny determined so predestination brother Brown says looks back to what for knowledge for knowledge looks to Destiny real simple I'm sitting over there several years ago and brother Harris was preaching on something I don't even remember what it was but God showed me predestination I'd never seen it before in my life but I saw a book come up before me like this and the pages just started unfolding and I could sit there and it wasn't physical words on a paper it was just a knowledge that came into my mind about predestination but even in that when brother Dale brought out foreign knowledge that just opened up a lot more but I knew those he foreknew the Bible says those he said who he foreign knew he did predestinate all right now that proves the predestination of God you can't be the word unless you're a thought you had to be in the thinking first but you see in order to stand Temptation you had to bypass the theophany right right if you bypass a theophany you couldn't come here with eternal life because eternal life is the theophany of God Amen I don't care if it's a spot or a speck somebody said the other day said well it was this little spot in me I said the Bible says we need to be without spot or blemish so it does away with a spot right what is the spot I mean good grief a spot of God's all of God so I just I just got the realization that God wasn't nowhere around when I was doing the things I was doing except he was just waiting on me to come to a spot a place I don't want to be mean but you know what I'm tired of people just taking quotes and doing this and taking quotes and doing that and doing away with the word of God brother Brown did not come here to confuse the word of God he came here to make the word of God more plain and nowhere in the Bible it ever says that you were born with eternal life the Bible says you're born in sin shaping iniquely spouse from your mother's womb come forth a liar find God in that somewhere then the Bible even says your unclean Spirit goes out of a man well where was he was in you where was God he was just waiting he already had this he's not nervous he already knew what day that's why you weren't born on any certain day you always was but I'll read you a quote in a minute where brother Brown says eternal life started at the altar because you had to be a day you come to a place to make a choice either receive it or not all right but you see in order to stand Temptation you had to bypass the theophany you had to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin and then if you stand all the father has given me will come to me and I'll raise him up at the last day see you had to be first what you had to be first in the foreknowledge of God right then when you came flesh to be tempted of sin then number 70. and then you see he come right down the regular line from attribute before the foundation of the world his name was put on a Lamb's Book of Life that from that he became the word the theophany that could appear disappear and then he became flesh and returned back again resurrected that same body in a glorified condition all right but you bypass the theophany and became flesh man to be tempted by sin and then if this Earth the Tabernacle is off we have one already waiting we have not yet the bodies right numbers paragraph 71 but look when this body receives receives that's in red because it's brother Brown should have said but when this body realizes you always was no I said this body receives the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to God hallelujah he is born of God does not commit sin he can't he cannot sin he never did Sin because the seed remains in you and you cannot sin too simple there's therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus they walk not after the flesh but after Spirit there you are see that throws your body subject you don't have to say oh if I could just quit drinking if I could just just get in Christ and it's all gone see see because your body is subject to the spirit it's no more subject to the things of the world they're dead they're dead your sins are buried in baptism and you're a new creation in Christ and your body becoming subject to the spirit tries to live a right kind of life keep reading paragraph 72 like you women claiming you got the Holy Ghost and going out here and wearing shorts and things how could you do it how could the spirit of God in you ever let you do such a thing as that it just can't do it certainly it can't he's not a filthy spirit right he's a Holy Spirit and then when you become subject to that Spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit all right and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest or quickened Hallelujah made a life and when the Bible says don't do this that body quickly turns to it you remember when you was out in the world and I never did this because and I wasn't going to bearing anybody else but I never drank beer but you remember you just go to the beer store and just buy a beer did you ever even have a conscience of what she's doing most of the time no you didn't because if you like beer you went and bought it right right if you want to go to a dirty picture show or if you want to go do whatever Corrals and cuss I didn't have to it you know it didn't bother me to say bad words why I wasn't so I was subject to the spirit that was inside of me not the spirit of God change when God came he changed me I can't change myself but I had to accept and say God if that's you that's what I told him I said God if that's you take that pain away and he did and I was in church that night because he knew he didn't know it because a lot of a lot of people said well things have happened to me and and they're still out in the world well you know God will honor your faith I don't care if you prostitute but he honored my faith knowing that I would continue on come to church that night and give my heart to God and start living a life it's not been a good life I've lived in front of people but it's been better than it was okay why because I've been changed I'm not the person I used to be I've been regenerated regime I've heard from my theophany you're going to hear that in a minute okay everybody okay I gotta hurry then when you become subject to the spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest or quickened made alive and when the Bible says don't do this that body quickly turns to it there is no question keep going you got it yeah okay what is it it's the earnest of the Resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already started it was once subject to sin and mire and Corruption but now it's got the earnest it's turned Heavenly now that's the earnest that you're going in the Rapture it's the earnest all right let's go to number nine which is contest who is this Melchizedek then when a man is Born Again from Heaven he becomes a spirit babe in Christ now there ain't nothing in there that says he was born with this Spirit In You did it when a man is Born Again from heaven from Heaven Jesus told Nicodemus you must be born from above he becomes a spirit babe in Christ and then when this robe of flesh is dropped there's a natural body theophany about it not made with hands neither born of a woman that we go to then that body returns back and picks up the glorified body it's a reason that Jesus went to hell when he died preached to the souls that were in prison turned back into that theophany o marvelous thank God Second Corinthians 5 1. Fish Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved the certainly Tabernacle we have another waiting see all right now watch the red see we have bypassed that what do we bypass we went to hell with Jesus but that was in theophany form because we bypass the theophany but the part of me that's Eternal now was in that man that went to hell that's what went to hell that's why I went and I ain't got to go no more he paid the price to bring this out reveal more of himself not another person but more of himself all right then we bypass that to come straight from God the attribute to be flesh to be tempted and tested by sin like Adam did but when testing of his word is over then we are taken up to this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world it is a word there that we skipped so he didn't come by the word we come by permissive well all right to come right around down here to be tempted and tested if we'd have come through that there'd be no temptation right in other words if we were to come see often if we would have come with a theophany eternal life that's what I told somebody the other day I said the problem with most people is there's three things they don't understand that we've been well taught here they don't know what a soul is they don't want to know what eternal life is and they don't know what the real New Birth is and Genesis 1 26 and 27 which may that's what's come to you it's a new birth so you can they don't understand them three they just think eternal life something that's just thrown out just well you always was eternal God said this and God said that you're always this you're always that no there's a there's a plan that ready this there's a plan and the purpose that God had right he had a plan but he didn't plan it because it's the way he wanted it we would have never come down here remember he predestinates not by his choice it would have been easy for his choices to me is just create his own kids that are already Eternal or never sick sinless No Beginning No End had been real easy for God but remember in God is attribute of healer savior Redeemer there's no way that could happen up here he had to bring us here and let us Fall by free moral ages he had to let us fall but what's he doing he's also a judge he's a just God is that what about he has to go by what the word says he's a just God and to be a just God he had to give everybody the same choice now I've heard people preach it that you don't have a choice nobody you know you're something special and you are something special I can look back and see that I'm something special right but only in God I'm something special only in him am I special I'm not special because I was born some great lineage or or I'm better than this person or that person you know God is Sovereign he can do what he wants to do but he chose not to do what he wanted to do because he had what desires attributes in his heart he had desired his DNA makeup was was to give salvation to a group of people that needed it to scale to me that makes him more wonderful than just being God that created all universe and he's just the purest of pure and he is but he let us see a side of him that others won't ever see because the ones that don't see salvation will never see a god of salvation they'll never see a god of redemption because they what their free choice is they never will accept it right so God don't have to put it for he does God doesn't do something wasted wasted movement you know he I was watching Brother Gary Cranston and putting up a a putting that beam up the other day and uh they couldn't get the seams all right and I thought man if they take that thing down one more time they took it down like three or four times I thought well God you're not that way when God put something together you know what everything fits perfect one time but we as humans we have to decide and choose but what about a God that just there it is right right but he doesn't predestinate because there it is he prayed that predestinates because he foreknew that we would want it down here and then he could display his wonderful attributes not just one attribute but all the attributes he could display them all right if there had been no temptation we'd denote all things what's he saying we're lost that's the reason Jesus note all things because he was worried before he was flesh then we become the word here we are formed to the word image to be a partaker of the word feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning you see that little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey all right he's saying when you were born he said when you started your journey many of you can remember it you joined this church and that church you know I've heard people with the analogy of the eagle story your brother Brown gives the eagle Story Watch The Eagle story because they said oh I always was an eagle that means I always was eternal well now remember he calls them chickens denominational chickens right isn't that what he says you're in the barnyard of denominational chickens well that means you were sitting in a denomination and something was calling you and you were an eagle and you came to this message I don't think he was so much as saying you always was eternal and then you just see that's what they're saying you always was eternal and you as an eagle always in the barnyard eating and then you heard the eagle and you just realized that she was eternal right right now we're salvation in that don't sit there with your mouth open my hurting priest if you'll go back brother Joel let you listen to one okay some of you already listened to it I just can't understand I just really can't but thank God for the truth here we are formed to the word image to be protected of the word feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning you see that little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey many of you can remember remember he's talking about people that have come out of the churches into the message right let's come out of denominations into the message that's what he's saying here look at paragraph 88 then after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food then you left the other thing he's talking about denominations each in that age that Pentecostal age got it in that Pentecostal age there was a lot of people went through Pentecost went through Baptist went through methodists went through all these things and then now they heard the eagle cry yeah to coming into the message that's what he's talking about after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food then you left the other thing you have then been formed into the living image of the Living God you heard from your theophany which is what the word form seed of God which is the word of God had somebody tell me the other day so when my brother Brown wasn't really wasn't really when he said that she was born with a seat in you it just wasn't really the word I said I want a quote for that brother Brown said it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God but the seed our word this come predestinate eternally from God not you the person got it my name not he may not even be way Dale up there exactly got it so it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally I just but you watch I mean they'll they'll put that cow up in the top of the tree sometimes and sometimes you have to kind of bring it back down right right then after you Rob his Eagle food then you left the other things you have been formed into living here as a living God you heard from your theophany of this or this is all we have one waiting gotta hurry number 10. Hebrews chapter four so it's nothing you could do I want you this now this all that we've been talking about is about this man hair all right we've been kind of back and forth but I want you to watch what he says here so it's nothing you could do you're a sinner to start with you're shaped in iniquity you're born in sin come to the world speaking lies you were born here in this world by sexual desire of your father mother and you're just as hell-bound as you can be I don't care what you do you might never lie still keep every commandment and everything else and you'll go to hell like a Martin to its ball to its box but the only way that you ever can live again is to accept the Holy Spirit God's eternal life what made you what you are all right now listen because now he's going to go back up what made you what you are in the beginning when the Holy Ghost brooded over the Earth a little Easter flower comes up God said that looks pretty just keep brooding flowers come up grass comes up trees comes up birds flew out of the Dust animals come up a man come up now how was it done by the brooding of the Holy Spirit bringing these materials together potash calcium making the flowers making animal making you right okay let's just keep reading right here paragraph 234 just reading straight down and now you've got a free choice God Broods back to you and says hear my voice Harden not your heart like in the days of provocation here he comes down preaches the word that's how you hear it you have to hear the word because that's where it comes from you can't come word form and not hear the word right you can't come to that the gospel preached unto them was not didn't have faith in it so it didn't do them no good they heard it but they didn't believe it why because they made a choice number 11. the Messiah 1961 now for instance when a man gets saved he's just about like the light that comes into him can everybody read that again the light that comes into him is about like this little white button on my shirt just for analogy just for I mean it's not but he's making he's making a point that's when God comes into the inner part of a man now if it was already there why do you have to come to it okay but see when brother Brown you you read the quotes you always was eternal you never was on a certain day you never was born a certain day just remember this is what he's talking about go back to Genesis one man and this is what he's talking about not after the fall right before right here what's in Us by the new birth the quotes will match other than that it's not going to you're going to always go to you always was eternal you never was born on any certain date and all this okay that's when God comes in the inner part of a man the inner part of a man a man has made up a system of a Tabernacle in the outer Court holy place the holy of holy Shekinah Glory on the inside then he talks about the five senses but we're not going to into that so let's read 11 a see if you can put 11a up there for me there you go I had to slide this one in 1961 seed shall possess against the enemy read the blue you'd have to transfer the life of an orange tree into that thorn tree and then it would actually Bear oranges because the life's inside of it is orange of course you couldn't do that naturally it won't cross that way but that's what we are I thought we'd come here always eternal but that's what we are like we are now a wheat a grain of wheat and God's Garner when we was a kookaburra and you say last Brothers 1961 that's before the uh that's before the opening of the seals I've got about six after the seals he says the same thing but I ain't got time to read them but listen to this and God changed us the one after changes if we always was and God changed us from a couple bird to a grain of wheat it makes the fruit different changes your own mind your own ideas it's the greatest miracle it's the greatest miracle that ever happened when a man or a woman is Born Again of the spirit of God and becomes a new creation in Christ Jesus 11b and after this man sinned listen to this this is kind of the way that that I see it let's read in 1950 but now brother Brown didn't know as much in 1950s he did in 65. he was still a prophet the word still came to the prophet he didn't become a prophet in 1963. all right but now look the first man you can't see him God second man was a Halo now you take a third man and make him like a little white cloud coming over we can see him the Holy Spirit coming down and he's all man that's the soul of man Eternal then yeah right here Eternal then hmm and after this man sinned he marred that soul Blackness darkness comes into it and then God come down and told him he always was eternal and he never did that's not what he said and then God came down and lived in man suffered with man to redeem man and the Holy Spirit comes into man and drives that Blackness and sin away from him amen and brings it back into perfect Fellowship a part of God and now we by the blood of Christ who cleanses us from all sin we become sons and daughters of God 11c right here this is 1960 this is the adoption series the one I was telling you about a minute ago you begin your eternal life right here at the altar here's where you start eternity oh you start eternal life right here then you are born again a son of God and then when you die when your death strikes you in the body and the Heart quits beating the Mortal Wills begin to stand still that little shadow that was a shadow of the shadow in one second it becomes a shadow of a shadow next it becomes a shadow unless it becomes a trickle and it's secrete next the river and it becomes the ocean and after that we're standing in the presence of your loved ones standing you under clothed in the garments of a Celestial body that you know one another and love one another you turn back to a young man and young woman exactly because remember on this adoption series is when brother Brandon went across the curtain of time before he before he thought that theophany was like a ghost where you couldn't shake hands and all these things like that but when he went across that curtain of time he comes back and preaches this adoption series and a couple other messages you know he says hey I know what it is now they're real they can be touched they can be felt and all the things like that now let's go back to go back to number 11 because I didn't finish number 11. thank you roll it on down and that's the way it is that's that it that way is through self-will whether you will to or not that's up to you but that's the only Avenue listen to this that's the only Avenue that's open to the man that God can come into his heart is by self-will choice choice self-well right but that's the only Avenue puts him right back like Adam and Eve on free moral agency again you can choose right or wrong either one you want to now keep going to e19 now self-will then God comes into the man into the heart which is the spirit then the spirit makes the soul and then the soul dwells in the body now when a man is converted say just like that little white button starts in his heart now that part is God that part's God when he's born again with the spirit of God God's spirit dwells in him right right so now let's not look at the last one for right now but everybody understand what we're looking at now when brother Branham talks about what he he says you always was eternal everybody understand what he's talking about the Genesis 1 26 man the one that you were supposed to be had there not been a fall but there was a fall there was a fall of Man so God could display his attributes of Savior healer he had to come down here and get us out of the pawn shop if we never was in the pawn shop he didn't have to go get us out we were in the pawn shop like brother Dale said we put ourself in there because this self-willed just like he said well it's Adam and Eve's fault no it's not well it's Mom and Daddy's fault no it's not well it's brother and sister fault no it's not right you're going to stand at the judgment and there's not going to be it's not going to be Guilty By Association you're gonna have to stand what you did on your own all right unless you're born again of the spirit of God and you know what that's already been judged because how can you judge something that was always Eternal right how can you judge something that's sinless how can you judge something that has no beginning or no end that's not born on a certain day and it's the very seed of God it's the very DNA of the Almighty can't judge that that's what comes to you that's why brother Brown said the new birth is the most important thing in your life is to receive that new birth all right but now we come down here and we see we haven't talked about this much but we see an atonement was made then we see Redemption and salvation why would you need those if this came in you at your natural birth you wouldn't need this but that right there is sep that enmity is a separation but you can only come back to God his provided way all right he presents you the plan and you accepted or rejected it's just so simple you accepted or rejected and then you know what even when you're born again you still are on free moral agency you still have a self-will whether you want to do this or do that or or growing with God I I um somewhere I was reading well it's downstairs where you read a quote where brother Brown says that face not going to do it alone I read it this morning wow you think boy face everything remember we read it this morning faith is not going to do it alone you've got to have virtue to add to that Faith knowledge Temperance patience godliness because you know what that's what this is that's the DNA of God that is the DNA of God right there but you know what that did not stop the plan of God when we came here but I want you to see something there's a revelation that comes only in the end time now we know this is we know this is the has been a new birth since Paul Peter and all those right up to Wesley right this was a new birth but there was things that was withholden that people couldn't see they could portray the characteristics of God but they really didn't understand all right because you know you see people in um even songwriters they they speak in a in another person sometimes when they're writing songs well it's an anointing if they're not born again it's just an anointing but if they're born again man it just it's a spark that really connects and that's why when you sit here and you listen to the word being preached and there's something goes off there's a little a little spark that goes off what's it connecting to your word for you're coming into the word form word upon word word upon word line upon line but now what was this Genesis 1 26 and 27 this is my last quote number 12. from that is the rising of the Sun because this is something that is unique just for the end time all right Now who is the son of man in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us right and if all the teaching that we have in confirmation for the word of God by the word of God by signs wonders we see today that in the Book of Luke here that we just quoted talk about Luke 17 30 and all those that we are acquainted with that that word again is waived over the people that the Dead traditions of man is dead and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit right Among Us and is giving us life this this was the spirit man right but where was this headed in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh remember brother Brown says flesh becoming word becoming flesh that was The Mystery of the son of man there's your mystery of the son of man right there that's what the Lord showed me the other day and they hadn't seen it before that's a mystery of the son of man right there how that this right here can be operational in flesh and Jesus was standing on Earth and he said the son of man has the power is that what he said to what forgive sins and the Son of God wasn't changed at the resurrection the son of man was changed at the resurrection now this came back and picked that body up in May but that's that right there was heading toward the son of man which is a word made this wasn't flesh at first this was not flesh got it this was not first but it was put in flesh the first item fell first Adam was the son of God he didn't realize everything but the son of man when that second Adam come he knew he was the son of man he knew he was that word form made flesh now what do you and I got to realize that we're not a son of Jesus who was the son of God we're the son of man made manifest in another form called a bride that's us we are not just ace on a man brother Brown said I'm a son of man revealing these son of man but like they had said years and years ago the bride of Christ has got to be the son of man because this right here was heading toward God walking around in the Garden of Eden in human flesh in a plural form male and female but only be one I believe when we listen I believe when we get to the Future home when we get to the Future home nobody can live in that city except these people right here the children of God and the 144 000 as eunuchs are servants to the bride now what's going to happen is what if what if a man outside the city or a woman outside the city what if they want to talk to God they gonna go look for Jesus himself are they going to go look for you yeah and realize when you walk outside that City that your God made manifest in another form how about that exactly I mean that's the word right God made manifest in another form called a what a bride I got it thank you at Genesis 1 26 and 27 man culminates down here in the son of man right here because there's no more made after that there's no more he was the beginning of the creation of God where the continuation of that creation let's sing a song 403 number 403 I've been changed I need a change of a book thank you I got it right thank you I've been newborn all my life has been rearranged Oh What A Difference it makes when the Lord listeners now well I've been to the water and I've been by uh that I once was and what redeemed is now my name But realize that's where we came from and we were redeemed free with Brother Ray he's going to have some tests done he's going to a specialist so we're going to agree he said don't even pray he said just everybody agree that everything will be all right all is well all is well amen I like that don't have to pray just say speak the word what the Lord 's life things how can people hang on just a minute sister Susan has brought up a good point my mom's suffering I want all the sisters to come up here every sister in the church now if you're not going to believe don't come up here but all the sisters because brother Branham said he said that lady that prayed for that woman that the baby was healed she entered in because she was a mother herself so if you're if you're a mother it doesn't matter mother or not if you're a female come on up here sister Susan wants to pray for Mom she's downstairs watching but it has affected her spirit it's affected the way she does things you know Mom she likes to get out and do stuff but all your sisters need to enter in you and let me explain a few things here you sisters have hip problems that aren't us men don't because of your child bearing years and things like that you know that and you have arthritis where we don't have arthritis and you have aches and pains where we don't have aches and pains because you're a different body but maybe it's like Susan said maybe we can get the sisters here to bind together Pray For Mama all during the week she's going to a specialist for her hips pretty quick but if you combine together if you have a hip problem if you have a problem with arthritis if you have a problem with your knees your sisters just bear in mind this whole week and I want you to pray so I want you to pray together it's been put on her heart and I believe it's true you can enter in where we can't right okay you can enter into to that problem that that you have as females that we can because we couldn't pray for somebody that had a child and and realize that we went through childbearing and to me it's foreign you understand but now what about a sister the dinner end that has some problems that had this problem they had that problem okay so we're going to bind together she wants all you sisters to bind together and you pray and man we're going to pray too but I want you sisters to pray and pray this whole week that we're going to bind this thing that's not going to bother anymore okay let's bow our heads tell me the father we pray Lord that you said in your word that if two or three oh just agree on any one thing that Lord it'll be made manifest you've laid Upon Our sister's heart which is a wonderful thing Lord that we've got sisters around the pulpit here Lord that if maybe someone went through the same problems and situations that our mother is Lord and Lord you know in myself that I heard every time she walks because of the way she has to walk and and bend over and and have pain and Agony and all the things Lord it hurts us too father we pray that you would someone would touch you father that you'd forgive all the sin in our life and the things that we do that are wrong and that you'll clear all that Humanity back and that you'll hear our Voice through the blood Lord because when you took the stripes on Calvary you took the pain of arthritis you took the pain of suffering away Lord we just got to realize that father that that atonement of that healing power was finished at Calvary and Lord now we stand as a church United Lord all the sisters together praying Lord that you'll bind that thing that's that's hurting our mother Lord that you would just take that pain away from her Lord and whatever the doctor needs to do Lord we pray that you'll touch his hand and deliver whatever needs to be delivered father but you're a God that heals all of our diseases you're a God that has taken care of a lot of things in this congregation now Lord I pray that actually standing right under our feet or sitting right under our feet is the one we're praying for and we pray Lord that you'd anoint that person father that you would heal her in the name of Jesus Christ only one sufficient name there is no other name except the name of the Lord Jesus Christ where all things will be made new father we pray that you just sanctify us Lord just be with us and bless us as a people as a church Lord as we bind together even this week Lord as our sister Lord has the prayer cloth that she's going to give her Lord and and for that also Lord that you would keep them strong years are coming on each one of us Lord but we pray Lord that you would strengthen Lord as as Joshua said in his 80s he said I'm just as strong now as I was 40 years ago father you're the same God you're the same real one you're the same person Lord that stood there and said that Lord I pray that you just now release that Lord that our faith will release Lord that healing power it'll come upon even each one that's standing here Lord that you would heal all of us father that you would Grant this request that we have a petition now that we hold before you Lord that you all help our sister Lord the pastor's wife Lord she's part of the pastor and we pray that you just lift her up father for your honor and Glory just bless us now Lord take care of us and as we pray in Your Name Lord that you would just be with us and buying that thing that's going on in her body father we ask the things in Jesus name amen amen just just bind that thing I just don't even accept it just you know you can take all kinds of things you can and it's like Daddy said sanctify your medicine and and all that but God wants us to trust to him amen amen if it ever put something on your heart you know what you need to do it I had one thing happen to me and I'll tell this before we and then we'll close and if nobody need anything else I was in Jamaica one time and we watched the video of the tent meeting that we had in ginger Hill and the Lord really uh came down in that meeting and I was so weak when I was finished till it was uh I was preaching on the vision that they were that they were supposed to not just see the vision because brother Brown had a vision of Jamaica and how they were supposed to be the vision not just see the vision but be it they were a part of that vision and he saw the man running up the hill okay well sister Brady had just had her breast removed because of breast cancer and you if you you don't remember I know Dad remembers but her arm just swelled up this big because she'd have to hold it like this so she'd have the whole time of the whole weekend was her hand was up like this because if you put it down here it just swelled up just huge and the Lord told me to speak to her and I didn't and that's bothered me every day of my life I don't care if she's dead now that didn't make any difference but that bothered me that that's bothered me even till today that I didn't because the Lord spoke to me I believe in it was a complete aisle between me and her that was nothing in the way for me to walk over there and tell her I said sister you don't have to do that anymore the Lord heals your arm but I didn't do it I didn't obey God you know what I've been paying for it ever since so don't do that there's nothing too dumb in God I don't care if a man's got a fingernail uh got a hangnail pray for the brother if God tells you to go over and lay your hands on that person come and lay hands on that person you're not gonna bother me you shouldn't be scared to let somebody lay hands on you you shouldn't be scared for God to discern the spirits in the in the church and and see what's going on among the people so I thank God for sister Susan doing what she did and she said she wanted the sisters to come up here see that that was a channel so through that channel you sisters can pray that something that us men can't do that but now us man we can enter into things like prostate trouble and things like that we can enter into that and we can really pray because that's a problem that we have in our physical life so that's the way we need to do it we need still we still I mean we're we're that Genesis 1 26 and never sinned and all those things but you still got this thing because there's one quote I didn't read brother Brown said this is going to be sticky this is the cuckleberry that's going to be sticky for the rest of your life until the change of the body so this is something we have to be aware of we have to be attentive to we don't need to destroy this thing because the Bible says who destroys the body which destroys the soul you got to be careful with this thing to tell you what to do but you know you're sad we all need to pray together and the women need to pray together for brother for our sister Dale he's watching his wife suffer and it is taking a toll on him just like it's taking a toll on her right yeah because one he calls both of them so it affects I don't think his effects is preaching he's doing some pretty good preaching but uh but in the natural life it does affect it does affect you when you're you've lived together so long then all of a sudden you can't do everything right there together you know so let's just let's just bind that thing let's just not gonna we're just not gonna let it bother us anymore okay love the Lord been here too long I hope you enjoyed what we what we said that that kind of maybe will help you to to see the quotes that when brother Brown's talking I told the group one time before I said brother Branham sometimes is talking here that God's already done something
