[0:00] no throwing it go boom there we go
[0:05] that's it I kind of backed up a little
[0:08] bit and hit verse Romans of three we
[0:14] were kind of like circumcision last
[0:16] Sunday and so I want to back up just and
[0:19] read a little bit of this because I want
[0:21] you to watch Paul continuous thought
[0:23] Paul Stoddard's continually you know
[0:28] he'll hammer once dubbed it and then
[0:30] he'll he'll get off of it but then
[0:33] they'll revisit it later on so he's
[0:36] getting on it here and then he'll be
[0:37] getting on in four days we've got all
[0:38] those a little bit so watch to declare I
[0:40] said this time his righteousness they
[0:43] might that he might be just and the
[0:44] justifier of him which believed in Jesus
[0:46] name once he taught me so much
[0:48] circumcision circumcision or
[0:49] uncircumcision it made no difference in
[0:52] the flesh if you're certain times or
[0:54] uncircumcised is done it's the
[0:56] circumcision of the heart right it's the
[0:58] it's the excess skin that you have in
[1:01] your foot in your rub spirit being that
[1:06] we need to keep cutting away so
[1:13] Oh sister Johnny's mom passed away some
[1:15] of the family that's probably why she's
[1:17] not here
[1:20] also remember us we're going to be gone
[1:22] next Sunday and the next onion a lot of
[1:24] other people are too so remember if
[1:26] we're gonna go Oklahoma and then we're
[1:27] gonna go to Branson Missouri for a
[1:28] little while Claudia ginger and then
[1:29] come back free friend it's like that one
[1:32] did you do the last one so you did the
[1:38] one before that yes so it releases don't
[1:43] now he was gone he was that's right so
[1:47] it leave me Louisa sterner your turn
[1:49] because you had a full month then ham
[1:51] that name up this Louisa starts Oh
[1:53] Louisa have next Sunday
[1:54] you got the Sunday after that okay the
[1:59] Sunday after that when you show up next
[2:03] Sunday and Louise is doing it you do it
[2:06] the next Monday that's the Sunday ever
[2:10] back hey Louise has got the first
[2:23] alright then we got all the other signs
[2:25] good people everybody's covered with you
[2:27] - I appreciate that thank you
[2:29] a lot of people want to use counseling
[2:30] stuff so just remember selling crack the
[2:34] declare I said at this time this rocks
[2:35] instead he might be Justin to justify
[2:37] him to believe in Jesus now what's
[2:38] called on Matt he went he's going
[2:40] through the part of uncertainty and
[2:43] uncertainty where is boasting then in
[2:46] the clip excluded because what the Jews
[2:48] were doing they were boasting
[2:50] we are the cup we did what Abraham told
[2:53] us today so we're under that Abraham
[2:56] covenant that if we were circumcised but
[2:59] the problem is they lean more to the
[3:01] circumcision than they did to Abraham's
[3:04] bill
[3:05] even because Abraham what the father of
[3:07] our circumcision I handled the father of
[3:10] our faith
[3:11] man so and what that's what he's trying
[3:14] to get then the Jews remember the Jews
[3:17] came to Jesus and said we'd be late for
[3:19] him see why so they were circumcised
[3:21] naturally in the flesh so they said
[3:23] we've done everything that we you know
[3:25] we've done everything we do wrong we
[3:28] gotta move this quote book we go by
[3:29] moment right we've been circumcised so
[3:35] we're fine Jesus is like you may have
[3:38] been fine before but you're not fine now
[3:41] no there's a new covenant coming in
[3:44] there's a new Testament and the blood of
[3:47] Jesus Christ that will eradicate sin not
[3:51] just covering because even in Abraham's
[3:54] condition whatever happened to Abraham
[3:56] not only covered his sin God didn't take
[3:59] away from Abraham what's not a child of
[4:04] God Abraham the friend of God that's why
[4:07] people don't and you see people still
[4:09] weird louia you come okay well you've
[4:15] got next Sunday school class next week
[4:17] gonna be okay thank you
[4:20] but Lewis is running you know need
[4:23] running the guy the other day that boost
[4:24] oh did I have had a lengthy discussion
[4:27] about the people in the Old Testament
[4:30] not have a linear birth but remember I
[4:33] told you the new birth eternal life you
[4:34] go you got to pull that apart
[4:37] compartmentalize it because it's not
[4:39] exactly the same thing right you can be
[4:41] a part of eternal life and not have the
[4:43] new birth but the new birth in the end
[4:45] eternal life so you you have but you
[4:47] gotta think about that goal Abraham did
[4:50] get eternal life but anyway I'm didn't
[4:52] give you eternal life while he was here
[4:53] in flesh right somewhere when Jesus died
[4:56] when the saints went into whatever
[4:58] dimension they went into they were
[5:01] imparted eternal life because they were
[5:03] the blood of bulls and goats and then
[5:05] the blood of Jesus Christ get away with
[5:07] their sin but you and I are born again
[5:10] here alive so now here's Paul and that
[5:16] has everything to do with what Paul's
[5:17] talking about because Paul says I'm born
[5:20] again doesn't matter if I'm circumcised
[5:22] he was because he was new wasn't you all
[5:25] right he was circumcised but he's
[5:27] talking to the uncircumcised and the
[5:28] circumcised trying to get him to say hey
[5:30] quit back okay God brother branham was
[5:34] trying to get hours listening to take
[5:35] the other days tell my trainees you bad
[5:37] this message this you message
[5:39] spot the Lutheran you lose them five to
[5:40] Penn College you better call a clinic
[5:42] off alright so they're sitting there
[5:43] fighting each other and he said saying
[5:45] don't have to do anything he just left
[5:46] y'all fight right so and that's what
[5:49] Paul's do the palms walking with a group
[5:50] of people that says well I'm circumcised
[5:53] I'm doing everything that the Old
[5:54] Testament standing policy that's fine
[5:56] cuz it keep talking to law watch where
[6:00] it's boasting then is excluded so that
[6:02] he's saying Jews Campos de jure under
[6:06] this covenant because that coming that's
[6:08] been annulled done away with when Christ
[6:11] died Louise she got make something okay
[6:14] July 1st you hear clear thank you
[6:17] I wanna build your for you bigger win
[6:19] tonight with us to what is boasting then
[6:24] it is excluded by white law well the law
[6:27] in the Old Testament said if you
[6:29] circumcised because circumcised
[6:31] circumcision did not save Abraham that's
[6:33] what they're going to saying that
[6:35] circumcision is what saves us that's
[6:37] what the Jews was thing but he'd never
[6:40] saved Abraham it was just a sign that
[6:42] God accepted the faith of Abraham
[6:45] okay so that's what he's fixing to talk
[6:47] about going on down to Roman's force or
[6:51] watch
[6:54] by my law works actual cutting on the
[6:57] flag no name but by the law of faith
[7:01] right therefore we conclude there's his
[7:04] conclusion we conclude that a man is
[7:07] justified by faith without the deeds of
[7:09] the law right
[7:12] he's not finished though is he the god
[7:15] of the Jews only what's Paul doing he's
[7:18] trying to bring them together
[7:19] is he not also of the Gentiles
[7:22] yes of the Gentiles also seeing it is
[7:25] one God I'm at the bottom of the
[7:27] chaplain looking from seeing it is one
[7:29] guy which shall justify the circumcision
[7:31] by faith and uncircumcision through
[7:34] faith all right
[7:36] so by faith we're standing here with
[7:38] Griff a there believe what would they do
[7:40] it they were believing unto Abraham was
[7:45] believing unto Isaiah was believing unto
[7:48] all those Old Testament people were
[7:50] believing unto what that the Messiah was
[7:52] don't come and say all right but now a
[7:56] circumcision by faith is a people
[7:58] standing on it
[7:59] we're circumcised by faith now amen
[8:03] do we then make void the law through
[8:05] faith no like I said last time you can
[8:08] take the Old Testament and throw it in
[8:09] the trash it's given four examples
[8:13] huge examples of the way you should live
[8:18] do we then make more than off your faith
[8:20] god forbid yea we establish the law in
[8:24] other words we're the only ones that can
[8:25] really believe what the law say alright
[8:34] remarkably
[8:39] all right Roma for now watch continue
[8:41] the thought continue the thought what
[8:45] shall we say then now well he's bringing
[8:47] Abraham in what shall we say then that
[8:50] Abraham our Father as pertaining to the
[8:55] flesh hath bound may for him your seeds
[8:59] going to be covered the earth like the
[9:01] sand in the ocean all right for if
[9:05] Abraham were justified by works now we
[9:09] know he circumcised itself but that
[9:12] wasn't that was just showing that was an
[9:14] outward show then he believed what God
[9:17] said where they for him were justified
[9:20] by works he hath whereof to glory
[9:24] cuz you feel remember when Abraham
[9:28] circumcised these circumcised himself at
[9:30] ninety nine years old I took a lot of
[9:37] faith
[9:40] - do-it-yourself at 99 with no pain
[9:45] medication does that one thing but he
[9:48] had faith but now watch though Abraham
[9:50] never speaks of that again
[9:52] read your Bible now people speak of
[9:55] Abraham and his circumcision and Abraham
[9:57] of the things that he did but Abraham
[9:59] never boast that I'm certain that I'm
[10:02] certain size and you know I'm know
[10:05] they've read he was Abraham until he
[10:08] died and then later on though the
[10:10] stories were told don't remember what
[10:12] written down until Moses wrote them down
[10:16] Genesis Exodus Leviticus and numbers so
[10:18] that the story of Abraham was not
[10:20] written until Moses wrote it in the
[10:23] Torah are the first five books of the
[10:24] Bible but somewhere between there and
[10:31] that's our problem somewhere between
[10:32] that point and where Paul was standing
[10:36] and even where Jesus is standing
[10:38] it got so messed up that they said it
[10:41] was all the certain seasons while saying
[10:44] not to faith of Abraham because when
[10:48] they come to these Jews that were
[10:50] circumcised that's it we're done we're
[10:51] circumcised
[10:52] well believe on Jesus ha he's the devil
[10:55] well circumcision did them no good okay
[10:59] but if they would have had the faith of
[11:01] Abraham remember what Jesus saying
[11:05] before Abraham was I am if you would
[11:07] have believed a for him you'd believe me
[11:09] you'd believe Moses you believe me he
[11:11] told him he said you're not believing
[11:12] you're just going by works you're not
[11:15] believing you have no faith in what they
[11:18] did for certain guys we're done that's
[11:20] it
[11:21] then we'll priests are standing there
[11:23] less than after them women in their mind
[11:25] and and under the law there was no
[11:29] problem because well I'll just said you
[11:31] touch a woman are you are you 20 commit
[11:34] fornication but jesus walks up and says
[11:37] I want to talk to the inside guy the
[11:41] inside guy is the one you got probably
[11:44] and that's the one that you're left with
[11:46] now he Jesus is I say unto thee
[11:48] if you look on a woman to lust
[11:50] during your heart you have committed
[11:52] adultery with her already well you can't
[11:54] commit adultery in your mind right
[11:58] adultery is an act between a man and a
[12:01] woman in the play
[12:04] they said spiritual adultery we know
[12:06] that but natural this what we're talking
[12:08] about natural adulkin to the priest were
[12:10] going
[12:11] we're circumcised and hope you get this
[12:14] in today you know I go to church I read
[12:17] my Bible that's okay that's good but you
[12:20] got to keep going you got to keep doing
[12:22] the thing you gotta have faith listen
[12:26] you got to faith in what you do if you
[12:28] just kill this recurrence because it's a
[12:30] ritual or because you're gonna get
[12:31] talked about if you don't come you might
[12:34] as well go somewhere else but if you
[12:37] have a by faith I was thinking it wasn't
[12:41] me brother John would had a discussion
[12:46] the other day after father's that thing
[12:48] you know yes it's by faith that we do
[12:51] things not of works lest any man should
[12:54] but that's what that's what we read here
[12:56] you know no I can boast but but it's not
[12:58] we do these things by faith we have
[13:00] faith I have Johnson I have faith that
[13:04] if I put my last ten dollars in the
[13:05] collection plate by faith if I put not
[13:07] just ritual
[13:08] he said if I put ten my last ten dollars
[13:11] by faith God's got to honor of that and
[13:14] bring it back a hundredfold so if he
[13:16] puts in ten you'll give him back hundred
[13:18] somewhere because he said I've seen it
[13:20] done that in my life he said but I have
[13:22] faith he said I have faith when I come
[13:23] to church I'm gonna hear from God not
[13:25] not that I'm just going to get the
[13:26] church and we're just gonna talk about
[13:29] this and then we're gonna have little
[13:31] family discussions and then we're gonna
[13:32] you know
[13:33] then we're gonna go home no you buy
[13:36] faith for if Abraham was justified by
[13:40] works you know that millions of people
[13:43] are going to get a gold star for going
[13:45] to church every Sunday and that stars
[13:47] will be available with that star means
[13:50] nothing right but now if you do that and
[13:54] have faith that God will do something
[13:55] for you big difference and you'll see it
[13:59] manifest and we think you stand manifest
[14:03] in your life that if you do something by
[14:04] faith God will honor it but if you do
[14:06] something by works because we're not
[14:08] justified no work we're justified by
[14:11] faith but then our faith remember James
[14:14] have the discussion my works and my
[14:17] faith but as it works his faith
[14:19] expressed that's the sermon title works
[14:23] this faith expressed so if you come to
[14:26] church knowing that God's gonna do
[14:28] something for you and knowing that
[14:29] brother Brian said you can't wait till
[14:31] the doors open to get the church now
[14:33] that's just not coming in sitting down I
[14:35] believe brother Brown was talking about
[14:37] the inward man the end one person has a
[14:39] desire to go to church okay
[14:42] sometimes we let the flesh get involved
[14:46] well human where Abraham were justified
[14:50] by works he has to wear up to glory but
[14:53] not before God okay not before God
[14:57] because remember Abraham had all the
[15:00] scenario Abraham was is a man walked up
[15:02] to him one day and said you're gonna
[15:05] have a baby with Sarah and I'm gonna
[15:10] bless that whole lineage and him 90
[15:13] years old and Sarah 80
[15:15] well 75 million sixty five hundred first
[15:18] total then he walked 25 years 25 years
[15:23] so he had faith without works but what
[15:26] did his faith produce his faith produced
[15:29] works because he finally got a body
[15:31] change and had the baby and that's our
[15:33] whole deal here's I mean somebody
[15:37] the other day accountant living man Tony
[15:42] but you know we think well we used to
[15:45] all this time trying to figure out how
[15:48] can we hide a gun or hide some food man
[15:53] listen Dave ball 55-gallon drum of
[15:56] gasoline one time we put it in the
[15:58] hottest place you can put fake in there
[16:03] with you know what we were thinking and
[16:04] then we did we buried 22 shells as we
[16:08] can't even find we can't find them we
[16:12] hear them up friend the young end of
[16:13] woods and we can't find them I mean when
[16:16] a prelude to a metal detectors and try
[16:17] to find can't find them well here's what
[16:19] they're useless but that was the
[16:25] mentality back then was we were going to
[16:26] try to make it through a certain part of
[16:30] not tribulation but the certain part of
[16:33] the of the you know the squeeze or the
[16:37] whatever you want to call it but hey
[16:40] look now they look at technology think
[16:43] Drive bar you house Canyon house tell
[16:45] where you are how much money you got
[16:47] anything in your home and your cell
[16:49] phone is the DPS they've already turned
[16:52] it on and convicted people with it so
[16:56] forget about trying to hide you better
[16:58] have faith because I'll promise you your
[17:01] words will do you no good
[17:02] that's what's gonna happen and I'm
[17:04] telling you now we're gonna come up to a
[17:06] place when that doors closed you're done
[17:12] you're done for if you're not in Christ
[17:15] and if you're not if you don't think
[17:17] about it we may talk about this a little
[17:19] bit later but remember the third pole is
[17:22] not a public
[17:22] third full is not a public show the
[17:26] third poll is not a public anything
[17:29] right even up here in the sanctuary it's
[17:34] an individual that comes to a place they
[17:37] can say god I need a drink of water God
[17:39] I need to be here
[17:40] oh I need a pork chop god I need a sure
[17:51] that's all thanks I'm stateless so if we
[17:54] get into work pack enough word into
[17:56] where God can man we can be manifested
[17:58] sons of God my brother they'll teach
[17:59] enough things to be manifested sons have
[18:02] died then what's the third pole the
[18:04] third pole is going to pull us away from
[18:05] those things it's going to pull us to a
[18:08] place that then nobody's been being
[18:10] brought before because we've always said
[18:13] third pole but I believe we've always
[18:15] started with the third push there's a
[18:18] big difference because we're trying to
[18:20] push everything you know won't even I'm
[18:22] gonna buy me all this stuff and put it
[18:24] up you know it's not bad to have that
[18:25] stuff but the other thing I'm saying I'm
[18:27] just saying don't sit there and lead
[18:29] them that talk to a brother one time and
[18:33] bless his heart he just about a shell as
[18:35] well anyway he's gonna buy gold and buy
[18:40] silver and then he's going to be able to
[18:41] wants to squeeze happens there won't be
[18:43] no paper money so he's gonna be able to
[18:45] I said so you're gonna take a brick of
[18:47] gold this works about $2,500 if you
[18:50] gonna try to get final over together
[18:52] we're gonna do shading out of there just
[18:54] that way I said you just one you're
[18:55] gonna shave some weight off of that I
[18:58] said no they gonna take that whole big
[18:59] bottle of gold you got so you know like
[19:03] I said though that was so carnal though
[19:04] that we're gonna try to make it through
[19:07] the squeeze no once we get to that point
[19:10] God is obligated to take a screw so I
[19:13] put on my face like a crown cuz watch
[19:16] Abraham listen Abraham with a human
[19:18] being
[19:18] here's Hagar young girl
[19:22] here's Abraham 75 still can produce you
[19:25] know understand Jason okay I'll help God
[19:30] that sound like you've done it
[19:31] I don't help God
[19:34] and when he produced not the will of God
[19:37] he produced an Ishmael which is what's
[19:40] fighting over yonder now right
[19:43] but when finally Abraham comes down one
[19:46] day and says dawn of 99 I can't even get
[19:50] out of bed in the morning Sarah team
[19:54] remember where she's out half the time
[19:56] okay and God said okay that's where I
[20:00] want you and then one day to wake up
[20:03] what brand new people brand new 20-year
[20:07] old ready they're ready to do what God
[20:09] said to do but it wasn't them doing it
[20:12] it was God doing it so that's the best
[20:14] thing for us to do say God you promised
[20:15] it you promised it so it's not my words
[20:20] you see how updated this is now this is
[20:22] Paul talking the Romans they are not
[20:24] talking about body change they're not
[20:26] talking about even coming to adoption
[20:29] but he's teaching and option to try to
[20:31] get the people to come up to a level to
[20:34] see something but you know what this
[20:36] word eternal so guess what today this is
[20:38] justice this is updated as it's gonna
[20:40] get this is today word right here okay
[20:43] cuz what we're putting it in the now
[20:46] body change right my favor hand was
[20:49] justified by works he had we're up to
[20:51] glory but not before God why because God
[20:55] knew he's won they did it they ground
[20:57] them for what saith the scripture
[20:59] abraham believed god and it was counted
[21:03] unto him for righteousness
[21:04] first the abraham believed god then the
[21:08] sign of circumcision came to prove that
[21:11] he had believed i'm guns already said
[21:13] now to him that worketh is the reward
[21:16] not reckoned of grace but of debt
[21:19] alright look he just worked as a balance
[21:22] sheet something god if i'll do this you
[21:27] got you you know i so max not balance
[21:30] sheet now now we're waiting the balance
[21:34] is the found water all right so no don't
[21:36] work god now if i go to church
[21:38] five times you're obligated doesn't know
[21:41] but if you'll go to church 25 times
[21:43] thinking you'll get something from God
[21:45] and you're not coming to see everybody
[21:47] but God you know what he's obligated
[21:49] them to do it now to him that worketh is
[21:52] the reward not reckoned of grace but of
[21:54] debt because remember grace is what
[21:56] unmerited favor not of works lest any
[21:59] man should boast
[22:00] but to him that worketh not but
[22:03] believeth on him that justifieth the
[22:06] ungodly his faith is counted for
[22:08] righteousness well I said we've got to
[22:11] be a believing group of people yes I
[22:14] mean we got to believe we don't believe
[22:17] in something they were saying hey man
[22:19] but you know what I see what he does I
[22:23] see the Word of God and I said that's
[22:25] thinking this morning you know when I
[22:28] walked around in the world with sin now
[22:31] there was no there was no God inside of
[22:33] me because none was gone and then clean
[22:34] vessel I'm always trying to ask the
[22:36] people said look when out unclean spirit
[22:38] goes out of a man where does it at if
[22:40] it's unclean God can't be in there all
[22:43] right come the Bible says the iron
[22:45] things buried goes out of a man all
[22:48] right so God and he'll can't be in there
[22:50] in that unclean spirit can't be in that
[22:51] same time what you're doing is you're
[22:54] making a way once that unclean spirits
[22:56] gone you making a way for God to come in
[22:57] but there is still representation in
[23:00] this Bible this is the seed that
[23:04] everybody's trying to think in some
[23:06] little spot some little eater this is
[23:08] their right here I was in this so now in
[23:13] the beginning was the word and once they
[23:15] met this morning to begin what's the
[23:16] word the Word was with God and word what
[23:19] the word the seed in the beginning was
[23:22] to see seed was with God Satan thing
[23:25] done man right so now that's where I'm
[23:30] identified in the seed Word of God right
[23:33] here so when he came on the earth I was
[23:36] in him not an unnatural
[23:38] jerm numpy because remember and this is
[23:44] for later on but remember Jesus
[23:48] inherited eternal life in his flesh so
[23:50] you and I were not in his flesh right no
[23:55] no we were in the British soul or the
[23:58] essence of that man Jesus that's where
[24:00] we work right so we weren't in the flesh
[24:02] so by the flesh we're not kidding to
[24:04] Jesus but now once the inherited eternal
[24:07] life now when you inherit something what
[24:09] do you do
[24:09] it's yours and you know what if I
[24:12] inherit something who died give it to my
[24:17] and my joint out so he received eternal
[24:21] life in the flesh so that we can receive
[24:23] eternal life in the flesh but he had but
[24:25] he had to be eternal life in his soul
[24:27] work and that's the word that's what was
[24:31] in the beginning was the word right
[24:35] there by alright so that so now that I
[24:38] can count that when I was walking the
[24:40] walk of the center God wasn't nowhere in
[24:43] my soul
[24:44] he can't dwell in an unclean vessel
[24:47] right but I was in the word I just
[24:52] hadn't realized it yet I had come to
[24:54] that place yet toward God can quicken I
[24:57] had to hear the word so I had to receive
[24:59] but then he quickened it and then when
[25:02] he quickened did that made in life
[25:03] that's why we can read scripture like we
[25:06] do now and not be confused because the
[25:09] one that wrote it is in you okay
[25:15] but to him that worketh not now they
[25:18] don't mean you don't have to do nothing
[25:19] you hear what I'm saying that see
[25:20] everybody no we don't have to do nothing
[25:22] really you know you can be circumcised
[25:25] go to church never dream never comes
[25:26] next well but you're still a sin right
[25:32] to him that worketh not but believeth on
[25:35] him that justifieth know the only one
[25:39] person they can justify right according
[25:41] to the first seal one true Living God is
[25:43] the only justifier of anybody is that
[25:46] one true and living God named Jesus
[25:48] Christ right that justifies the ungodly
[25:53] well that must have been us we were not
[25:57] of God when we come into this world we
[25:59] were of our parents and then of a sinful
[26:01] nature we were of God in the word but we
[26:05] hadn't come to that yet but now look his
[26:07] faith is counted for righteousness to
[26:13] change our body that's once they had to
[26:15] change it to come to the change of the
[26:17] body it can't be any do's and don'ts
[26:20] that you did not one doing don't did you
[26:23] that no one show me one show me what I'm
[26:30] doing though did you can do they don't
[26:31] change your body
[26:32] there's not one well I go to check we
[26:36] may not be able to get to everyone like
[26:39] a notice my faith Abraham
[26:43] I don't believe Abraham the morning he
[26:46] got his body change I don't believe that
[26:48] night he stayed up all night and had
[26:50] this real religious experience you know
[26:53] say one thing he just woke up one
[26:55] morning and he was in the place God
[26:57] wanted him to be in but he looked over
[27:01] and thought he got her own bed because
[27:03] he had a real young wife leaned over the
[27:04] side of me then he looked in the mirror
[27:06] and said
[27:09] you know what he knew that was it
[27:11] because his face had what been counted
[27:14] his faith was counted but now his faith
[27:17] was now fulfilled because he hadn't been
[27:20] changed back with something he couldn't
[27:22] do and they had one son I think which
[27:25] was the promised son all right so it's
[27:30] not about works but your works is your
[27:32] faith Express so don't ever forget work
[27:36] because I promise you in this day and
[27:38] age with all this technology and all
[27:41] this stuff like they said the other day
[27:43] you know you're being watched whether
[27:45] you know you're being watched or not
[27:46] there's cameras everywhere well God's
[27:49] been that since the beginning of time he
[27:52] said I camera on all of us you know me
[27:54] what we're doing on the earth is just
[27:56] manifesting to a degree the ones I've
[27:58] already been doing right even as david
[28:02] also describeth the blessedness of the
[28:05] man unto whom god imputeth righteousness
[28:07] without works saying blessed are they
[28:10] whose iniquities are forgiven and whose
[28:12] sins are covered blessed is the man to
[28:16] whom the Lord will not impute sin though
[28:18] that word impute means to is the verb to
[28:24] reckon or to count now look at David my
[28:32] David and his best friend killed
[28:35] murdered murdered that was premeditated
[28:38] murder he would have been that would
[28:40] have been a federal offense in this day
[28:42] and age and he'd be putting federal
[28:43] prison because he told the guys when the
[28:46] battles high would draw yourself show
[28:48] that he can die then he takes his wife
[28:51] he's already committed adultery with his
[28:53] wife before this but remember she was
[28:56] pregnant
[28:57] and to cover that pregnancy up she had
[28:59] to get you Rock Hill so that he can say
[29:01] what a man that's the guy I'm telling
[29:06] you about that's telling you that the
[29:07] blessedness under him God imputed right
[29:10] this without work and he did because God
[29:12] would have killed him if it was just
[29:14] been my work so I'm going to went
[29:15] through Nathan and said David you're the
[29:17] man so you're gonna die but what did he
[29:20] do we grace he went to Nathan the
[29:22] Prophet God came to Nathan the prophet
[29:24] and said David I've seen your sin I know
[29:27] what you've done
[29:28] but I know the integrity of what that
[29:30] very inside man okay which wasn't born
[29:34] again but he had an integrity they
[29:38] covered him because God knew what he
[29:43] would do if he would have had that man
[29:45] the man Jesus inside of it he would have
[29:47] never done this thanks but what uh but
[29:50] what a great what a great thing though
[29:53] that we can read about David and don't
[29:56] think it's so much of David until he's
[29:58] going to get the title of the son of
[29:59] David in the Millennium City would be I
[30:02] never intended to be a kingdom that
[30:04] would then be son of David to be on the
[30:06] phone for you know thousand years but
[30:09] now we would have convicted him and put
[30:11] it in prison right by his work all right
[30:17] but look we consider the end of the
[30:19] conversation Jesus Christ the same
[30:22] yesterday they have ever David was so
[30:24] much like God really spoke in the first
[30:25] person right there's my hands on my feet
[30:28] and all the different things when he was
[30:30] anointed God look David could only say
[30:33] sins are covered did you kick step did
[30:36] you catch that in the Old Testament
[30:37] stands were covered in the New Testament
[30:40] those sins have done away with just like
[30:44] I said about having a married in heaven
[30:45] uh those but it's a lot you have a
[30:47] husband that's allowed he's there he's
[30:49] right here
[30:50] they don't matter you never see him
[30:51] again a day in your life he's still
[30:53] alive but he's dead your freedom and
[31:00] blessed is the man to whom the Lord will
[31:02] not impute sin look what so Paul is
[31:07] saying look now
[31:09] come at this blessedness
[31:12] then upon the circumcision only in other
[31:15] words all this I've said lesser than
[31:17] iniquities O Lord will not impute sin
[31:20] circumcision only harm upon the
[31:25] uncircumcision also called bringing the
[31:27] two groups together right when we say
[31:31] that faith was reckoned to Abraham for
[31:34] righteousness not it worked right how
[31:39] was it then reckon see Paul asked the
[31:41] question and then the answer me how was
[31:44] it then reckon when he was in
[31:47] circumcision or in uncertainty
[31:52] because remember in Abraham's faith
[31:54] started when he says Abraham he doesn't
[31:57] after twelve Abraham get up and get out
[32:00] of the land go to a land I'm telling you
[32:04] that was when the faith debate with him
[32:06] began not when he was circumcised so
[32:10] that's what he's saying how was it then
[32:11] reckoned when he was in circumcision or
[32:13] in uncircumcision not in seventeen
[32:17] circumcision was asked to them was that
[32:19] was after the type of the Holy Ghost
[32:22] right he had walked for years years he
[32:24] they already had a smelly give his life
[32:26] away already one time and all these
[32:28] different things of that Abraham did in
[32:32] walking in uncircumcision but it was
[32:36] reckoned see that's what he's telling
[32:38] because of you know the Jews are going
[32:40] Abraham circumcised and we believe by
[32:43] Abraham you know he Paul said you're
[32:47] believing because of the circumcision
[32:49] that he's the father your faith so he
[32:51] said the father your faith started in
[32:55] uncertainty God started honoring his
[32:57] faith before he was physically
[32:59] circumcised okay
[33:01] amen look and he received the sign of
[33:06] circumcision a seal of the righteousness
[33:10] of the faith which he had which he had
[33:17] yet being uncertain sucker
[33:20] that's what he's telling them he said
[33:22] Noah well he is destroying no one of the
[33:24] Romans Hank I mean no one of the Jews
[33:26] hated him because he's destroyed their
[33:28] whole doctrine right here he destroyed
[33:31] it he had yet being a circumcised that
[33:36] he might be the father of all of them
[33:39] that believe though they be not
[33:45] circumcised remember he's going to see
[33:49] the Romans so the Jews and the Romans
[33:50] are going to come together you know the
[33:51] Romans were prefer or uncircumcised you
[33:54] know Gentile to use the circumcised but
[33:58] what's Paul trying to do he's saying
[33:59] look we got to put this thing together
[34:02] then he might be the father of all them
[34:06] to believe though they be not
[34:08] circumcised that righteousness might be
[34:12] imputed under them also it's not that
[34:15] everybody dispenses with circumcised is
[34:17] going to heaven ever by this
[34:18] uncircumcised blond hell that's pretty
[34:20] much what did you say tea-things
[34:23] desecrate our temple by letting do other
[34:26] Timothy or when I walk into the into the
[34:30] temple and then somebody was talking the
[34:31] other day and they get records of that
[34:34] today Kevin when you were circumcised he
[34:36] was circumcised by the priests and that
[34:40] record was kept let's see when Timothy
[34:41] walked into the temple they might have
[34:43] known if not known if he was a Jew or
[34:45] whatever but the priests were going hang
[34:48] on our record
[34:50] where were you circumcised and Timothy
[34:52] probably went I'm not there like you're
[34:55] standing in our temple you've desecrated
[34:56] falls like a Roman oh then you know you
[35:00] see what's going on here and the father
[35:03] of circumcision to them who are not of
[35:06] the circumcision only but they will also
[35:09] walk in the steps of that faith of our
[35:13] father Abraham which he had being yet
[35:17] uncircumcised he said that twice there
[35:22] for the promise that he should be the
[35:26] heir of the world was not to a
[35:29] him our to get seeds through the law
[35:33] because they can read the Torah the
[35:36] courtesan Abraham your seed is good you
[35:39] can't look up Abraham right look up
[35:42] Abraham see the Stars you're Steve's go
[35:44] with the Jews alive men were part of
[35:46] that I would we're one of that great big
[35:48] they went being part of that if they
[35:50] didn't believe if they didn't believe
[35:52] they weren't part of that sure
[35:54] physically they work but not spiritually
[35:56] and for the promise that he should be
[35:59] the heir of the world was not to Abraham
[36:01] or to his see us through the law but
[36:05] through what the righteousness of faith
[36:10] look for if they which are of the law be
[36:13] heirs I circumcised my son he
[36:17] circumcised his son he circumcised his
[36:20] son he circumcised then son always wait
[36:22] with him down so that's what - that's
[36:23] what the priests were saying my name's
[36:28] Ben in this book four generations from
[36:31] this one was circumcised my day
[36:33] circumcise me is that circumcised
[36:35] anything that's what they're saying
[36:38] Paul sin nowhere don't care about your
[36:41] book show me some faith all right
[36:44] foreign language read the law of the
[36:46] airspace is bait boy don't be just by
[36:49] the law faith has been made boy and the
[36:50] promise made of non effects when the
[36:52] promise has no effect because the law
[36:55] worketh wrath why did they'll all work
[36:59] it round there was no great there was no
[37:03] grace in the law right for where no law
[37:05] is there is no transgression pretty
[37:12] simple therefore it is a faith that
[37:15] needs continue this though
[37:17] therefore it is a faith that it might be
[37:19] by grace by grace through faith to the
[37:23] Enda the promise might be sure to all
[37:27] the seed not to that only which is of
[37:30] the law but to that also which is of the
[37:33] faith of Abraham who is the father of us
[37:37] all as it is written
[37:39] it was interpolating now what's he doing
[37:41] though that's that's telling that's back
[37:44] in Genesis 12 or 13 somewhere in there
[37:47] as it is written I have made thee a
[37:49] father of many nations before him who
[37:53] believed even God who quickeneth the
[37:55] dead now we read that and said why
[37:59] wouldn't he question Abraham Abraham was
[38:04] physically dead and his body in his
[38:07] flexion understand
[38:08] he wasn't physically dead died dead but
[38:11] his body could not produce what God
[38:12] called him to produce okay so God
[38:15] quickened the day he trained change his
[38:18] body and call it those things which be
[38:21] not as though they were Abraham's you
[38:24] can have a child yeah we'll have a child
[38:25] how old Sarah she why don't you buy 94
[38:27] and I'm 9 9 or what it was 1998 and 99
[38:32] and the people are like but you know
[38:36] what after they got a body change the
[38:38] people that didn't know them didn't have
[38:40] a clue but now I ever have a family
[38:44] probably didn't Sarah's family probably
[38:46] went what's going on here but you know
[38:50] what if they didn't believe it one
[38:52] County to them in it the Promised One
[38:55] team of that child one counted in nobody
[38:57] but Abraham was there no there and us
[38:59] because it was Abraham Sarah and the
[39:00] seed after him
[39:01] okay look who against hope believed in
[39:07] hope that he might become the father of
[39:10] many nations according to that which the
[39:12] spoken so shall thy seed be
[39:14] thanks talking look he's talking natural
[39:17] father many nations right
[39:24] and being not weak in faith he
[39:27] considered not his own body now data
[39:30] when he was about a hundred years old
[39:33] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[39:35] which on other words he never he never
[39:39] leaned on the part that I can't produce
[39:41] and Sarah came Perdue he said God you
[39:43] told if we don't have the baby you'll
[39:46] have to do the same way with the body
[39:48] chain we've got to give us a thinking
[39:51] the other day you know it he give us a
[39:54] road map he goes to a road map now for
[39:58] those of you that are old enough to
[39:59] remember the old road map were folded
[40:01] right yeah gonna follow the thing five
[40:05] fold ministry open the map anyway I do
[40:14] that think of thing that was well I did
[40:19] I thought well you know there's a road
[40:21] map but we used to fold there it man I
[40:22] didn't know you had to get a mat folding
[40:24] 101 to get some thing back together
[40:26] right but we've got a five fold map that
[40:30] we have a five fold ministry that we
[40:32] believe will give us there so he's
[40:34] already give us everything he already
[40:37] give that Abraham but Abraham's level up
[40:39] but anchor ham didn't have a leavener
[40:40] determine Abraham didn't have a Bible a
[40:44] abraham believed what somebody said any
[40:47] head and got accounted that for his
[40:54] faith those he believed that was God
[40:56] telling him at all right he staggered
[40:58] not at the promise of God through
[41:00] unbelief but was strong in faith giving
[41:02] glory to God now look he did stagger in
[41:05] his humanity it was wife Elaine had
[41:10] relations with Hagar try his best to do
[41:13] everything he could to help God and you
[41:16] think I've messed up but I like what one
[41:18] brother Stan said but if you look back
[41:19] to the Old Testament yes
[41:22] you see but when polyps through the Old
[41:24] Testament he had to look through Calvary
[41:26] he had to look through the blood curtain
[41:28] and through the blood curtain there was
[41:31] no thing when they were Helms faith come
[41:33] across who was a grim fate Jesus Christ
[41:36] was Abraham's faith he is the fact okay
[41:40] the things that we have was in Jesus
[41:41] Christ so if you look back through the
[41:43] blood he never stagger yeah so he's
[41:46] gonna be the father of our faith of what
[41:47] you know I mean we stagger human being
[41:49] but we staggered not at the promise the
[41:56] promise not all the other stuff the
[41:58] promise but was strongly faith giving
[42:00] glory to God and being fully persuaded
[42:02] that what he had promised who's that he
[42:04] God but God had promised he was able to
[42:08] perform and therefore it was imputed or
[42:11] counted or reckoned to him for
[42:14] righteousness
[42:14] now it was not written for his sake
[42:17] alone that it was imputed to him but for
[42:22] that's also Paul he brings him everyone
[42:25] together to whom it shall be imputed if
[42:28] we believe on him that raised up Jesus
[42:32] our Lord from the dead who was delivered
[42:35] for our offenses and was raised again
[42:37] for our what justification night amen
[42:42] so we'll stop right there and go to
[42:43] Roman's 5 and a couple weeks resolution
[42:46] so man it still gets real good being
[42:49] justified by faith he brings
[42:50] justification by faith all right the
[42:53] Lord bless you
