something okay all right Heavenly Father we thank you Lord Jesus for all your love and your grace unto us thank you for Calvary and we pray that you would just Lord this day come and speak to our hearts and our lives that we may Lord come to know you in life and walk after you because that's our desires it's not to to satisfy anything here in life but to try to Lord not to appease you because we don't want to do that but we want to be one who would satisfy you in our ways and actions Lord not to try to to make grounds of any form but to be what you want us to be just bless and guide each one remember the sick among us you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction and just have your way now keep us and guide us in Jesus name amen Matthew 19 begin verse three the Pharisees came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife forever cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore there are no more twine but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let not man put a su they say unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away he saith unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and who so Marth her that is put away does commit adultery you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now what what I want to do today is this morning is to just kind of uh review some things and uh go over it to for you to understand where I stand and what's you know my stand and why I take it I try to uh place it in the scripture I try to do the best that I can and I know according to most people uh they don't agree with me probably the way that that I believe on marriage and divorce but I believe it's scriptural I believe I can prove it and I've never had to uh change it from the beginning because I've done this over 40 something years and I've done it many times to bring series you know on like marriage and divorce and things to try to to get a little little better understanding and and all and especially for the younger ones coming along and all of that but I just want to kind of review some thoughts that we've been doing and maybe not as much reading this morning but just think on the things that we've tried to cover now the prophet said anytime that you speaking on any religious matters uh this the part of marriage and divorce will come up and when it comes up then it will you know will stir the people and they'll begin to ask questions and that's what happened there with with the Lord Jesus and they asked him a question there about it you know can a man put his wife away for every cause well he immediately answered it wasn't so from the beginning right and that was his answer it wasn't that he was you know playing around with them he was telling them this wasn't right to begin with you know what's wound up in trouble and all it was not right to start with but said now they said but why did Moses then give us a writing a divorcement he said because of the hardness of your heart he done that now we went back and went through through that trying to cover that that Moses just didn't give a right to divorce your wife for any reason you got to have a scriptural reason if you're going to divorce you know a man to divorce his wife and to to and then to remarry but we found that the woman has no right whatsoever because of the scriptural stand that was taken and all and and she has no right because Romans tell says it's her husband has to be dead there's no grounds for her whatsoever to divorce and remarry because it it's because of her being the fall in the beginning she was the one that caused it you said no Eve caused it and we didn't have anything to do with it well that's the part that's placed upon us today that because of the Fall we're in the condition we're in all right then in trying to just be plain and stand on it I I believe that you know if we would have prayed a whole lot uh we wouldn't have had as much trouble about our marital situations if we' have done a lot of praying done a lot of seeking the Lord you know instead of just our own lustful thoughts and ideas and and going forth it would have been different but yet we didn't do that so we're in bad shape you know life is and and then we we've tried to go through uh the things of what happened and we know and have covered what happened in the garden we know that Adam was first told himself while Eve was still in Adam to not partake of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil there is no actual statement to Eve to not do that cuz she was in Adam at the time and you know that was supposed to have taken care of it but we know that what she done she did partake of that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now that's a funny tree they tried to make it an apple tree A P tree or something you know and all and in doing it they they've come up with all kind of ideas but see we know what happened in the garden the Bible says that Eve said the serpent beguiled me he defiled me well now you take a Playboy magazine and I just make it blunt you get a Playboy magazine and you look at it and bless God I ain't going to read one well that's all all right I'm not I'm just being my what I am but you can take a Playboy magazine and read it and it'll tell you all of what happened in the Garden of Eden yeah but you talk to the preachers and they don't know anything what happened it was eating an apple well why did it wind up with all of us in problems why would Eve cursed about the you know the point of making it be in trouble with childbearing if it was eatting an apple now you order to get the apples and passie them out because your antidote has to come from the thing that you're dealing with with so then we were to get apples and pice them out but no anybody with any sense as I saying about to playm More Magazine you can read that and they can tell you what happened but preachers are so spiritual until they you know no no that's that's wrong thing well what happened why did Jesus have to come through the wound of a virgin why couldn't he come through the wound of just any woman why he have to come through the wound of a virgin and why didn't he come off an apple tree you know I mean is that sensible why didn't he just fall off apple tree right maybe he was a granny smith you know they're kind of bitter or a crab apple but we ought to know as human Mortals what took place in the garden that's right all right then in doing it see then she partook of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now what kind of a tree is that to partake is to eat thereof that's fine you know consume whatever you want to use the word there far but it was a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil well now I only know of one tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and that's Satan right Eve is not the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Eve is a tree right we fall off of our mother the tree sure that's fine but she was not the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil right see that would have made her something that was wrong Satan was created correctly right right but by this time in the garden that the fall had taken place we know that Satan had already been kicked out of Heaven Sin had already originated in heaven and he got kicked out and he came to Earth and begin to pollute mankind you know the Eve in the garden and in doing that see then Satan is the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and and I believe just like this I believe the seed of the serpent is still here see the seed of the serpent is unbelief the seed of the serpent is the Intercourse of the mind that uh Paul said I'm afraid that that Satan through his subtility would deceive you like he did Eve through the Mind here's where the battle starts it was not Eve the serpent that brought forth Cain it was even the Beast amen he was made a a snake he was made a serpent but he was an upright creature that would have been the link between man and the monkey and that's what you know Darwin couldn't figure it out they can't get that but if it had just been a little while and listen and read the Bible they'd have found it but anyhow just getting to the point just review a little bit Eve was seeking knowledge you say well there's anything wrong with seeking knowledge no not the right kind right you know but you go out there you look at the World by the world seeking knowledge what are they bringing death right sure I don't want to go back to the horse and buggy no I like our condition don't you you know I like a good home comfortable place that's fine but by doing all of that see like gunpowder you can go out and kill you're an animal and eat it but then you go out and kill people with it you know look at the automobile more people kill with automobile every year than any guns that's ever been right see that's the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil amen but then now we're going to outer space off of that tree right we keep eating and it just keeps increasing the way out until like in gen is it says nothing is withholden from man the imagination of man's heart is continually evil right but he's continually trying to do something with death we was listening the other day about brother randam saying it and you know it's true said that we've got spies in Russia he said they got spies here he said but we got very good close in uh you know uh allies like England he said but we have spies in England he said and they have spies here you know well why are you going to SP each other far if you're close friends CU there's always you don't trust nobody always trying to get Advanced and be ahead you know and and they get a bomb we want a bomb see but you see Church all we need is Jesus Christ all right that's the tree of life because the Bible said there was two trees standing in the garden amen one was a tree of life which was Christ himself there the other was the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil which was Satan right they surely partu of Satan in the wrong way if you even want to make it eat an apple go ahead but just remember it was a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil that you're having to talk about all right and we seen then as is saying the serpent seed today is right here now right Satan speaking in my mind and your mind right today trying to pervert us from the word of God Amen trying to change us from our our thinking the way that we should be right putting thoughts into our mind just the little things and all it takes is a saying that's right it don't take a big thing just a saying you can say to somebody said well what's brother so and so got to go oh forget it forget it I shouldn't have brought it up well you done planted a seed in the person's mind until they're tormented oh Bill Cunningham used to go to church with us years ago you could say that to him and for 3 Days he'd beat you to death just about it he he hounded you what's wrong what's that what they got against me some of you knew him and you know it was true but that's the way the human mind I don't care who you are that's the way your human mind works mine does yours does that's true Satan enters that human mind and that's what happened he entered that human mind of Eve and he brought her to a position position right all right right and see then once she partook then she took it to Adam and through her reasoning to Adam she brought him into a reasoning factor and brought death upon mankind because the Bible says and Adam all died right sure it would have been a problem to have said well why don't you just kill Eve and just forget it well see we want to go to the basis though on that we want to go and say well well that's true because he he needed a way to display his healer or savior Redeemer that's wonderful but now are you making your how can I say it are you making your excuse or reasoning for bringing something greater than God's purpose of being come on Amen you know maybe that's not the way of saying it but that's my point is that do we take things and say well this was going to happen well we know it was God knew it was right but did he make it happen that's what I'm getting at how could he make it happen and condemn us for being wrong amen but he permitted it to come into being all right he permitted it to come to a point of of being to where that mankind would reason he knew that was what would happen so he put us on free moral ageny where they are today we can reason out in our mind to accept this message and believe it or deny it and go on and people followed it 40 50 years and now turning against in in in all kind of things why because Satan still his seed of the serpent Cain was the seed of the beast in Eve but the prophet said you and I are a product of Eve and the Satan what's he dealing with the mind the mind is what keeps his problems doing the mind is where our trouble is at and that's where Satan went straight to that in the garden and he be to speak to her mind and got her to reason all right now he's doing the same thing right now to you I don't see anybody asleep right now so if you're not asleep your brain's got to be working and if your brain's working you're thinking if you're you're thinking you got a problem well I should have done this for left did I cut the iron off I don't know man you know that's that's life but you see that's what Satan works on all right but now listen before any woman if we're going to believe that Eve had a problem with the Beast and Serpent and Etc in the garden or eating apples whatever you're going to believe you're going to have to consider the fact that she accepted Satan's lie yes in her being and that caus her to do what she done now no woman can accept a man you know what I'm talking about in a sexual a fire unless you first reasons it out on their mind right all right and see when that happens then you're accepting that point in your mind and then the physical can take place see it's not the physical then you well I don't I didn't even think about that now you can play around in your brain if you want to but I ain't that done amen kind of a little too old for that we're not talking about rape cases we're not talking about somebody put in a coma and raped and stuff we' not do we've covered those things we're talking about human beings mortal right that are doing what they're doing see Eve accepted Satan's lie and then she was able to do what she' done all right see then I believe this what I wrote the seat of the serpent was and still is right now there still the same lie that the devil tells you right all right amen he's picking on you he he he he he's he's picking on me he he's really you know he does he he says he's not but he's picking on me even if if I am where does that change you right does that give you a right to get upset with me even if I called your name right and you guilty now if you're not guilty and I call your name then I'm the one that's guilty right right see that's what I've tried to get us to simply just sit down and think about things this time instead of just preaching quotes and and doing things and you just consider what's been said they brother around and said eve committed adultery there in the garden all right but see then our reasoning of our mind would come along because of what we've been taught they wasn't even married how could she commit adultery that'd be fornication well right you're going to dive right back over to where we read in Matthew 19:9 right and you're in trouble fornication and adultery is the same word technically yes fornication is what a woman commits before she marries adultery is after but after a woman is married you can call her commit an adultery it's still fornication right those that's still unclean living amen that's right all right so Eve committed adultery he said but they wasn't married see there's your old denominational background and now your mind is thinking according to what you was taught right you're thinking according to what you were taught you're not thinking according to the word of God right you're thinking according to what you were taught and our Satan is just doing it you know he's still dealing in that mind through that serpent seed that he's planted cuz he has no seed of his own he perverts God's word all right now see we say but they wasn't married we'll get to that this afternoon more of a marriage and what it is and things but you better read in the Genesis account and notice in gen Genesis 2 I believe it is that two times God says that's Adam's wife now you you just go back there and read it all you want to and you know you can say but but no no no s it's what you've been taught exactly right we've been taught all of our life this is our right hand right we've been all of our life to we're on the top of the world well you know them people down underneath exactly you know they're not standing upside down I'm just trying to make you think sensibly think it over sensibly and you'll know a whole lot more than you do by trying to figure it out by revelation amen talking with somebody while ago and I said this certain person said they got a revelation is all right for them to marry and that was the fourth time so I guess they got four Revelations you know that was you remember the other week we were talking about that we need a revelation I don't agree with that Revelation now I don't think that fits too good but now think of it if Adam and Eve were one then she committed adultery he could have put her away and God would have killed her but he loved her she was a part of him and he went out of the garden thinking that he could bring her back but found out he was out of the the garden and couldn't get back that's right okay now we talk about yeah but we need this to bring forth the Healer the Savior but as I said a moment ago don't make the fall greater than the Savior sure God permitted this to happen where he could bring into being but did he deceivingly plan it to happen I put service at service about that you probably didn't agree with that but that's your business your mind thinking I have no control of that but yet God can't make us wrong and condemn us for being wrong but if he makes us perfect see right complete then we go wrong it's not his fault then he can display his attributes to redeem just don't make it to point that we stand back say well now he he already had that back here before it ever started you know well be careful you're planning things don't make God the author of confusion all right make it the way God brought it into being he didn't make us wrong he made us right every little baby even from prostitution or whatever that baby is born with an immune system placed within her unless it's something wrong we're talking about normal person with an immune system that'll fight off diseases right see God has a way provided like we found out from cattle and thing if that little baby cave don't get that milk from that mother and it's called colostrum or something like that similar to the word if they don't get that within a amount a few hours after they're born it don't matter if they live another week they're going to die most of them because there's just nothing they can do because there's something in that mother's milk that makes that that calf to be able to live and survive God Made A Way and made everything right we're the ones that's messed it up right amen by our own thinking or own ideas all right we studied that God in the beginning made one Covenant that was with Adam said do not partake of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil all right Eve then being created from Adam and she was co-equal right right now everybody wants to holler and scream about she's the byproduct we know that but was she byproduct in a product or was she a byproduct to come out of a product or what kind of a by products you got see she was made that way sure where she could as a free moral agent go the wrong way and she did and then Adam went with her right all right then there was before then though there was just one Covenant that's right they were co-equal I believe she could move a tree in the garden as well as he could move a tree in the garden I believe she could speak the word as well as he could speak the word if you want my own personal opinion I believe that Adam would in the spoken word creation of all Humanity to bring forth the correct ones that he could have spoke it but he would have allowed her to say it why not does not God allow us to say it now are we not the byproduct of God no now don't call me a byproduct well what are you I got a few Choice words for that that I won't use but some of them's called dumb see instead of listening to God's word we want to reason it out and that's what happened in the garden amen isn't it sensible that you was made to bring forth and she was but now listen once the fall came then God had to make two covenants right amen right one with a woman one with a man not two covenants of Salvation not a way that he saved one way and she saved another way no it's the life that we live responsibility that we have your women are supposed to let your hair grow long not cut it but the men are supposed to cut their High that's Paul's saying men wees pants britches we call them women are not supposed to wear those things they're supposed to wear dresses right that's the two ways the prophet said a covenant it's life that we live the two Covenants and sure if she lives that Covenant to the tea in the correct order it will blend over into her salvation yeah cuz why is the woman given to the man not to reproduce the woman she was given to reproduce the man all now then if she was given to reproduce the man she just got in the way of how it was to come forth right and see in doing that then man was made to rule over her that's what it says in Genesis we read it we preached on it Andes and thy desire shall be to thy husband didn't say thy desire shall be to the neighbors and the people around you and every man that comes along supposed to be to your husband all right we went through that then polygamy came into being and as polygamy came into being then David could have 700 wives but you know not one of those wives could have another husband Solomon had a thousand but not one of them women could have another husband see we say yes but but look at it just you know he's got a th wives you know wouldn't it be lonely to be married to a man with a thousand wives I mean every once in a while you see him walk by there goes my husband hi honey you remember me I'm 983 it's truth ain't it that's right now you want my point of what I'm talking about is the last thing I want to talk about we say yes but it's a horrible thing living alone and not being married and I'm mean old guy a some men I'd rather be single than to be married to if I was a woman there's some women I'd rather be single than to be married to that's right you know we do have some Christian responsibility amen that's right right brother and I thought Christian responsibility was to pray and serve God Amen and that our lust and our thoughts was supposed to be placed away from us yeah we're human I'll try to get back to that but two covenants not about salvation right there's only one salvation that's through Jesus Christ amen but she has a certain responsibility according to Invisible Union if you read it and according to marriage and divorce a woman has certain responsibilities to live well we ought have that as a you know come on listen did brother brandom have to come and tell us how to live I'm waiting on that one did he have to tell us how to live I've heard preachers preach on don't tear down that pasture fence cuz that ain't a good Christian attitude if we tore down one when we was kid we got the daylight beat out of us and we put the fence up and had to hunt the neighbors cows so in the natural we didn't have any reason to tear down a fence they' run around and about to tell us it was wrong lust I never thought of that till the prophet said it well I guess you wouldn't a Christian where is oash and Christianity at what done away with oldfashioned this Christianity that's what I said I just want to preach today not read so much what happened to oldfashioned Christianity what happened with the fact that when you get married you're supposed to be married we covered in the New Testament there's no polygamy today R said I don't believe in polygamy amen he said it's wrong right sure he had to he was human being he said in countries where they practice it said they had a lot less trouble he did but see under polygamy the woman can't have no more husbands so do you say well well you know what no if you was in polygamy you'd have one husband and that would be the one you married to and it wouldn't matter if he had 999 more right you just found your place in the rank somewhere and stayed there but what happened to Christianity did Brother random have to come and tell us it was wrong to strip down and walk out on the streets naked women come on I thought oice and Christianity was supposed to taken care of a lot of things we standing yesterday in a place and this man I don't know where Mark brother Donnie one was stand there if you remember the man said he was from New Mexico and he said something about said I'm a Christian in just a minute they was words come out of his mouth it didn't sound too much like it you know but see that's just accepted yeah I I didn't cuss when I was a sinner and then I become a Christian then well it don't matter about them things you do and you say it doesn't we get to it this afternoon where the Bible says that by your words you'll be what Justified and by your words you'll be condemned but what happened to Christianity what happened to the New Birth is supposed to take away these things did brother randam have to come and tell us it was wrong I remember when I'm old enough I remember when ladies dress like ladies and men acted like men told you about it right there in front of my house where Wade lived there was a store the man was a carpenter and he had he was a farmer and raised cattle will you go to the store if was nobody there the doors open you went in and got what you wanted you wrote it down on a piece of paper if you didn't have the money and told the man what you got you went back and paid him if you didn't you laid the money down on the table and counted it out you know well he didn't have to worry about somebody stealing it would nobody steal that money what happened to Christianity does this message have to tell us how to live see it sounds like Satan's still working in his serpent seed line that's right that's right he said well brother D are you telling me that I'm lost why are you thinking that why are you thinking it but Satan through his subtility see brought this thing into being until our minds are perverted that's right she's no longer try to live a life and honor and respect and things you kids that are in school you know what I'm talking about a girl remains of Virgin she's a kind of a slided right you know she's not popular she's not in the In Crowd but it's like I've always told you you let that other girl go off and get into trouble y let her wind up with veneral diseases or some kind of a pragnant or something she'll run right back to that girl that she know is a virgin and she'll cry on her shoulder right did you see church have we lost Christianity and then we call it marriage and divorce if I get down there I want to say a few words see a lot of people didn't need don't I'm I'm honest I'm plain blunt I try to be that way I don't just you you know I'm not pulling tricks on you there's a lot of people that are free that if they just sit down and simply think about the scriptures they would be free because of the way the scriptures are laid out a lot of women are free if they knew what the scriptures are laid out but yet of our minds we're still bound mama said this daddy said that grandmother believed this okay they was responsible between them in God we're responsible for the word and see even the garden after the fall came there had to be two covenants one made to where that you sisters could live a life of being a virtuous person and why wouldn't you want to be why wouldn't you want to be a virtuous person come on children why would why don't you want to be well it wouldn't be popular is pregnancy popular is vano disease popular is every boy in this town knowing all about you popular just remember them little boys is full of the devil too you know oh they'll tell you oh I won't tell nobody else no not they get home get on the Facebook now they're what are they getting pictures right oh yes but he was my friend yeah but when Eve brought forth sin to Adam Adam accepted that because because he knew if he didn't it was death to her so he was willing to take her burden well I let my husband be the head you let him be your head you analyze that statement just a little bit right that's right I let my husband be the head you don't let Jesus Christ be your head you don't let him be your savior you better be glad you got one amen and honor and respect that head because of that right and see then polygamy came into being and when it did it's like a I was trying to explain how come it brought it into the animal race how come the animal race wound up into pamy I mean the human race is What fail but you realize we're the highest chain of the animal race amen right right the difference in us and the rest of the animals is is a soul making us a being in in the image of God but a higher form of an animal you see by doing that what did it release it released a spirit upon the people right and they went after it first account of polygamy in the Bible is about Genesis 4 layus had two wives Adam didn't have two wives he had a wife that committed adultery she had two husbands right right the beast in Adam right all right but it that spirit being released upon Mankind and their thinking it just automatically flowed right out into the human into the animal race and even though they didn't have a soul they have a life they have a being about them and it brought sin upon their situation one Buck many Do's you see if you stayed with a with a part in the garden where would we have been we would have never come into being that's plain lamage because it already slipped and fell and what can you do with it God permitted it to happen right and then when he permitted it to happen and he had to deal with it so he would actually take and have David having 700 wives or Solomon having a th and he'd use that to type Christ in the church to come on later cuz none of those women could have another husband right there was no way but now I tried to cover the point that the men don't like for it to be covered they like for you to preach about the woman that she can't marry but you remember it was a bunch of priest men it wasn't women questioning Jesus right it was men questioning Jesus amen can a man put his wife away for any cause or ever calls or whatever it say he said except it be for fornication if you put her away Matthew 19:9 for any other reason in fornication or saving except the same word look what happens well them Pharisees see they wanted it for any reason and you know what happened back there in the old days of Moses as Deuteronomy 24 is very blunt plain it doesn't tell you any way of making it to their hardness of their heart they took it in the hardness of their own Hearts to decide what was grounds and that's the way it is today that's but I've got grounds you can't tell me my brother-in-law told me one time we we wouldn't talk they were talking about it I sitting in the back of the car listening to him going deer hunting I was laughing because they were talking about marriage and divorce bunch of Baptist and things and he said you can't tell me I wasn't free to marry I ain't going to tell you I'm not going to tell you right I'm not going to say a word they got down there the hunting land and they all started getting out and somebody I forgot who it was there said Sam you ain't going hunting I said no I'm enjoying this I said some want stay here I want to hear the rest of this story you know but listen Church you can't tell nobody just done got their mind closed that's exactly right Amen brother lale had a statement of way of saying it he said our mind is crystalized on these things I wouldn't say that if I had heard him make that statement many times when you christianize a break shoe you throw them away right you can take them off and buff them and you got braks until you apply them about twice and then you got the same old slick situation and no breaks so throw them away right see when you're christianized on something that means you're not going to accept what anybody else says right right I told you about my brother-in-law as a Baptist preacher and me trying to show him that hell wasn't Eternal and he said if hell ain't Eternal I won't preach no more well who is he talking about God or me he was telling God if that wasn't right he wouldn't preach no more what about it see we went through trying to explain some things that her husband must be dead according to the scripture Corinthians we gave you Romans in different time Romans 7 especially that her husband must be dead did that's the only reason she can remarry I even got down to speaking natural I said women would say then well I'll just go kill the old boy and he'd be dead and they'll give me free to marry well that's okay you're free to marry but you're a murderer now what are you going to do and you plan to do it now what are you going to do I went through there this past week trying to be carnal on a lot of things I saying men are women you withhold yourself from your husband and cause him to go out or wife and cause him to go out and do wrong you're causing it that's right you so I just withhold myself the man would say I'll just withhold myself and she'll go out and get a man then I can divorce her for adultery brother Dale said There Brother Dale won't brother Dale going to ask you on question he going to talk to your wife and see how you dealt with that if you withhold yourself from her and you cause her to do that then you're not going to get me to have anything do with your marriage blunt Blain yeah but I thought the Bible said that way I didn't know there was but one grounds for a man to be able to divorce his wife and remarry I want to see it in the Bible I want to see it in brother Brown's message the word that you can just divorce your wife and Remar for any cause we went through it where brother R said you could divorce your wife for cutting her high but he says you cannot Remar okay but brother Dale you don't understand the man is he he's a yeah he's a hono muncho he he he can go out and do anything he want no he can't let me get back to what I said what happened to Christianity or you saying them people ain't saved they're between themselves and God I can't save anybody and I can't make anybody be lost but I can tell it like it is you see why we're in the mix up shape we're in the prophet why they say marriage and divorce need to be preached he said because of man's interpretation right mixed up theology made us in this situation but you see we think well Grandma was a good grandma but this is what she believed okay maybe that's all she understood you ever talk to people about something they say you and you ain't even said nothing you're talking to them about the message you telling me my mama wasn't saved that was in mind you didn't say anything thing it was in their mind wondering Remember Mama and Grandma answers to God themselves it's you and me that we're talking about that's amen all right now what then some people believe that you can put your wife away for fornication before marriage you know but then after you're married you could put her away maybe some would say but you can't read Mary well now I want to see that somewhere I want to see I want I want that in the scriptures I want that in the Bible you know I want it brother Brown's message a man can't put his wife away and marry again for just any reason he's got to have a scriptural reason all right we say well we got the quote FKS Brother D where it says if if she done it before marriage we got that but we don't have it where it says after marriage well I don't think there has to be any quote well who are you I'm me who are you I don't think there has to be any quote about it you mean a man's wife go out and commit adultery again he's supposed to keep her now you show me that in the Bible when when God put away Israel and married a gentile bride now I just want that one little Point well you got to live no you don't have to live in it and I've even told you sisters BL language I'm blunt on that you don't have to live with an adulterous man you just can't divorce him and Remar well I can't well the law says you can the law says he's going to keep them kids up and what's wrong are you a little lazy about getting out and get you a job maybe I'm too blunt I guess ain't I but I get the point across don't I that's right he even the laws of the land don't allow don't allow a man to be brutal or or mentally brutal Etc to a woman see that's yeah but brother I just couldn't make it by myself well is it better to live in a hell hole I'm plain right you know what I mean by that CH the words are not too good but when you get a situation let's go to that we'll quit in a minute cuz this is what you know this I wanted to review just a few things and then cuz see I believe that a man can put away his wife and marry again if she was untrue before marriage all right I believe that yeah and I believe that if his wife commits adultery I've always said it I'd be graceful I believe in grace if my wife came and told me she said honey I committed adultery with a man the other day I would question her to see if we could reconcile I could have been together 55 years you know and I would try to be sensible and try to be a loving husband and I believe in forgiving now but I don't believe in it happening two or three more times I just number one is a and I'm also pling about this if my wife told me she committed adultery against me and I accept her back I'll never mention that again if I tell her I forgive her right I don't believe I can do that well then you need a little more praying you need a little more patience and knowledge and Temperance does God bring up everything you used to do does he bring up to life you used used to live because see by your words you be justified and by your words you be condemned you know it'd be hard to get a divorce against your wife if you told a judge said your honor I know she done it but I forgive her go to court and try it and see what they'll do with you they'll consider the fact that something could be reconciled and it won't work all so blunt about this and that's the way you have to be if my wife came and told me to day that she committed adultery against her I would leave the house that minute because if I stay in that house according to the laws of the state of Georgia and I spend a night in that house with her I've Justified her acts you can't go live with her for two or three weeks and then decides you want to get rid of her oh you make it right then blunt and plain well I didn't know that you do now but you see Church what happened to our Point what's happened to Christianity yes what's happened to the the things that we should be to some of you that are single that you know your husbands you're divorced or whatever they divorc you or whatever took place can I be plunt without being hateful you didn't enjoy the way it was or you wouldn't be divorced that's true is that being nasty no so what do you want another one for well you don't understand about being lonely hey I'd rather be happy and be lonely than be Mis miserable and W somebody laying the bed with me back what I said while to go what out to Christianity where we're supposed to pray well I'm just not made like you brother Dale don't you're made to be a Christian aren't you Christianity is supposed to take care of our needs of our body is that plain enough a lot of people married the second time that wish right now they wouldn't married to that second person well I think after a while I got this person in mind he married a couple you know he made bad choices both times well you know after a while you practice or to get better you you know I mean I I I just wouldn't get number three if I'd filed up on number one and two I'd change my choice I'm just being honest Why Can't We Be I thought Christianity was supposed to taken care of a lot of things we want an excuse to fall back of a marriage and divorce situation the Bible says that if a woman's husband be dead she's free to marry but it's got a stipulation in it you know what that is I heard it quoted somebody else want to try what is that stipulation says only in the Lord let's see pull that one up be number two on the notse that's 1 Corinthians 7:39 well I just marry anybody there's where we messed up that's right that was our ideas and our thoughts but what does it say she's Liberty to be married to whom she will only in the Lord lord well now that doesn't say man D but you know I'm just too carnal to not believe that means a man we're not we're commanded in the Bible right I've got scriptures laying here and all but you ought to know it we're commanded to not marry unbelievers right you said well a lot of us did yeah and thank God they worked out am that's right right but we're commanded not to marry him be not unequally yolked together 2 Corinthians 6:14 with unbelievers now you get in the message people and what to have uh my church is only believers they are so if you can't marry outside of my church now I've never said anything like that that's right what is a Believer well if they don't believe my that's what you're saying you got to marry inside the church then and you're putting it down to where you people got problems cuz how can they marry and you rule over them so much they can't marry nobody else but somebody in the group you're in what's a Believer what's an unbeliever amen you know that brother around them called Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Believers Catholic Believers but yet he was the one that emphasized the scripture brought being unequally Yol together with unbelievers he said you're not marry an unbeliever but check out about his daughter and see who she was dating when he passed away a good old Baptist yes but that's that's a day gone by now brother we in a different age now what age we're in yeah I agree we're in another age it's age of stupidity but what is a believer the Bible says you're only to be married in the Lord how many of us checked it out to see who we who our partners were if as Christians or whatever before we married my wife was a good Baptist she was a member of a Baptist Church you know when we married I was a member of nothing have we lost all of those scriptures right then we try to find some reason or excuse through brother brandom or some loophole to try to slide through and claim that we're Christians pull up number four and let's see what brother randam had to say this is taken from questions and answers on the seals in 63 324 paragraph 100 now as I can find see not as I can find cuz Paul said that the married couple if the companions dead then they're free then to marry whomsoever they will in the Lord one of my kids come and tell me he said I'm going to marry somebody that's not a Christian and say we ought not do it right you ought not do it cuz you're going to have problems but you're going to have problems if you marry one that's in the Lord so you going to have problems best answer to them and say going to have problems not a joke just trueu would you see church we were supposed to marry in the Lord if my wife dies I go down to the Baptist Church and start shopping for a wife when I'm in to you and Believers now we're we're a little closer now Believers there is a lot of Believers you know that's supposed to believe this message and you marry somebody that don't believe this message you're going to have problems you marry somebody that believes this message you're going to have problems right right plain but true amen but we could at least stay within our own groups our own you know not groups like this group here I'm talking about at least somebody believes the message it because you try to convince that girl or that boy tried to convince that you know the the girl and the boy tries to convince the girl you know vice versa that this message is right you got a lot of problems so we could at least say well we need to be Believers you know let's marry among the Believers and of this message you know and then we could do that and we as doing that then we wouldn't be having as much troubles the main thing is a lot of praying amen now how many in here prayed before you got married Bob and Monica's the only two in the building got their hands up there's yeah sister Anna but you know what I mean now Lisa had her hand up and oh she's pointing somebody else okay Prett you know what I'm doing you know what I'm serious about right not a joke you know I'm serious how many prayed really you know sincerely prayed for God to send you a good husband or a good wife that's right right no no we had that little old bitty word called lust you think what you want to I'm dirty mean old God do what you want to we marry on lust basis 99% of the marriages in the world is on the lust basis well let's say 80% because a lot of them makes her you know they just pick out who you going to marry and ain't no lust about it you going to marry him you going to marry her and Bo that'd be bad wouldn't it my wife got in trouble talking to a certain brother about it she said I wouldn't take responsibility for my kids said sister you know you kind of got her point was she might pick out the wrong one well we did couldn't get the word out of him but we got it out of his son yeah that's right you know we couldn't get it out of him because he was don't you know but his son said yep we find out we goof up a lot of times you know all right that's right but listen church are you serious minded thinking we're supposed to marry in the Lord right now the one other thing that I was trying to hit the last part you know whether it be man or woman for you to get married you're supposed to marry a virgin right what happened with the old Christianity we supposed to marry a virgin he started doing it that way brother Rand said if he even took and said how many virgins are singing in the choir and he didn't count women or men you know he just said virgins Paul speaks of a man having a virginity just the same way as a woman has one and he's Duty bound to keep his just like she Duty bound to keep hers of course now here's our thinking in our mind that Satan put in there it's okay for him I got where brother Bram said it he can do it but she can't now show me where brother Ram said a man can marry anything other than a virgin I want it in scripture I want in his message he said said but but but he can marry a woman that's been married before you said her husband's dead he can marry her if she wouldn't right to start with he's living in adultery do what you want to brother Dale's blunt that's right right but that's plain brother Ron said If a woman was a virgin she marries a man and her husband dies the Bible says she's free to marry right if she wasn't a virgin she wouldn't be free to marry is that plain I'll clap my own self on that because it's sensible she's not allowed to marry she ain't a virgin and he ain't either got a lot of lot of us in trouble ain't we I don't like the way you are oky doie I don't either but is the truth the truth you can stonewall me all you want to that don't work that's right listen Church we're commanded to marry in the Lord and we're commanded to marry a virgin whether you a man or a woman right you're commanded to marry a virgin Heaven Help before I would even my wife she was a virgin I wasn't and I don't mind telling it because it's truthful I'm straight but I would not marry her until I told her about my life and I was a sinner wouldn't saved until two years after we was married Mas that a year after in a Baptist Church wouldn't even save for I had enough of something about me and I told you before you you don't believe it the prettiest woman has ever seen in this part of the country I got out of the car and walked off cuz she was married I had a respect you can call that anything you want to I had a respect for a married woman what happened to real life in Christianity is in anything show me where a man is to marry anybody he wants to well David married AB after her husband was dead that's is that true if she wasn't a virgin when she first married the first man was supposed to put her away that's Deuteronomy 24 so if you wasn't a virgin and you're married you're wrong he said well I told him about okay that's fine he accepts that he accepts the responsibility that's your business then that's between you and God there's no grounds for a man or a woman neither one to marry outside the Lord there's no grounds to marry except you're a virgin yeah but Brother D I don't like that because a man can man can what a man can put away his wife and marry again if he does it in the Lord and if he does it in the Lord he'll marry virgin she is a virgin to start with married a man he dies she's still a virgin or else it would be wrong to marry a woman that had been married before right come on are you listening right if she wasn't a virgin you can't marry her I don't care who she is well you're only dealing with the the bases of the man do here you're only talking about a priest no we'll get down stronger on that one that's right a regular person anybody else you know some of you your wife died you can marry again and you don't have to be choicy but you got to be choicy about it being a virgin now you show me where that ain't right you got a man virgin whether it's man or woman see then when you come down to it you say well he can divorce her and go remarry but he can only marry a virgin he can only marry in the Lord he's not supposed to marry an unbeliever he's not supposed to marry somebody that ain't a virgin but if her first husband is dead and she was a virgin to start with she's still a virgin or else Jesus was wrong when he would talk about it when they question him about the man right that her husband the woman that her husband died she married again he died the husband died hadn't died about six or seven times they said said when he get to heaven who's going to be who right yeah he didn't argue about their situation is okay for them to marry come on does everybody understand what I'm saying man or woman is supposed to marry a virgin right and see if her husband is dead Dead come on if he's dead she was a virgin to start with her husband is dead she's still a virgin a man can marry her because it's legally right but a preacher can only marry a virgin a woman that's never been touched by man even the prophet will tell you and then the only one he can marry that's ever been married married as a widow of a priest but she can't have had a problem in her life and him marry her my Lord Brother Dale where in the world are we all at we're all messed up that's the best thing to say all lost and undone and on our way to hell and deserve it thank God for Grace why did that Prophet come in he said take your wife you know that the Catholic church has a way of doing the Catholic church has a way of doing that if a woman has been you know had a husband or had boyfriends or whatever they get ready to get married they just go down to the priest he does certain things of course it cost her probably a lot of money but she does certain things and he sprankle salt on her turns her around she goes back she's free to marry that's Catholic church right sis she just said she didn't know she know just try to get and here comes a brother along in this message a preacher that's had a big following I don't know what he is now cuz I don't worry about it said he spoke virginity into this woman's body and I knew there's something about that so it took me a long time to be able to find it I finally found where the Catholic say that brother Brown was the one that said they say it that they speak virginity back you can't speak virginity back we're going to get down to Invisible Union I hope you're reading it if that old denominational husband ain't dead that's right you got two husbands it's not how many wives you got brother Hans had a good point on that that's what he said he said it ain't all them wi I shouldn't have said his name there but he said it many times from here his a't how many wives I've had he says how many husbands I've had brother Mo used to preach a message call are you married to Adam or Christ you understand what I'm saying remember if her husband be dead she's as a virgin if she is a virgin to start with she's still a virgin or else your marriage and divorce would be wrong I'm talking about brother brand on marriage and divorce right if she ain't a virgin yeah but I don't oh get off you silliness you know what I'm talking about she's still holy and clean though she marries the second man if it's free and right then she's holy and clean not talking about your human parts or else I'll ask you some questions and it'll end it with it is a rape a marriage you better be careful what you say about those things I happen to can handle a scriptures a little where if a man find a woman out in a field and he lay with her that's right he's got to marry her you want brother Brown's words and you want his words of this I was looking at it this morning he said if that man does that woman wrong you know takes her lays with her he's got to marry her and said now I'm quoting him he can never put her away even though she become a prostitute you want that quote that's what your Prophet had to say we don't play games with Christianity you don't play games with the Bible well can a man put his wife away for any cause well why did Moses do that straight sorry but I have to answer to him for what I say a lot of times I goof up and say things that are not right but my heart's right I'm trying my best to help you and I'm sorry for being the way that I am but I'm trying to help you cuz I'm trying to help myself let's stand that's right almost 12 we won't have just we won have no music we just sing I love you if anybody has a need love you I love because he first Lov and Pur my Sal he said brother Dale brother so and so can preach it so sweet and I just oh I just love to hear them preach a lot of times you don't even know what the preachers are saying when they're so fast and like popcorn running you don't know what theyve said but you sit down and think that's right what happened to your old way of Christianity that we were supposed to live right and do right before we ever heard of this message this message doesn't have to tell us how to live probably said adulter is wrong you don't have to have the Bible to tell you that what about it father we just thank you for your love and your grace unto us and we ask you to be with us and guide us and forgive us when we fail you we're just trying our best to help the people and I'm sorry Lord I just don't have the ability to be anything other than what I am and I'm sorry but we try to lay in your word and study it and and be ready and speak about you because there's just one thing involved and that's you Lord you are truly our husband and that old denominational husband ain't dead we're still thinking our own ways of marriage and divorce and our thoughts and ideas but Lord we're supposed to be married to you just forgive us Lord and gu us have your way with us be with everybody as we go eat a meal brag us back together this afternoon to talk about you in Jesus name amen you're dismissed remember anybody about the brother burley's meetings for Youth Camp things if you want to go I love
