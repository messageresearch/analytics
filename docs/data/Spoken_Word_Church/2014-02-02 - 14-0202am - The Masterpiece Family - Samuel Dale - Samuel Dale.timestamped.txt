[7:56] we check that we look into the word to
[7:58] see what it says about you and it gives
[8:01] us understanding of who you are and we

[8:27] delivered us from destruction just have
[8:29] your way Lord we thank you for your
[8:31] grace and guidance and keep us in Jesus
[8:34] name
[8:36] amen Isaiah
[8:45] 53 who hath believed our report and to
[8:48] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for
[8:51] he shall grow up before him as a tender
[8:53] plant and as a root out of dry ground he
[8:57] ha no no form formed our cess and when
[9:00] we shall see him there is no beauty that
[9:03] we should desire him is despised and
[9:06] rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and
[9:08] acquainted with grief and we hid as it
[9:11] were our faces from him he was despised
[9:14] and we esteemed him not other words we
[9:17] didn't want to even look at him if he
[9:18] was in the Masterpiece you know surely
[9:21] he had bore our grease and carried our
[9:22] sorrows yet we did esteem him SMI Sten
[9:26] stricken smitten of God and afflicted
[9:30] but he was wounded for our
[9:31] transgressions he was bruised for our
[9:33] iniquities and the chastisement of our
[9:35] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[9:37] we are
[9:39] healed all we like sheep have gone
[9:42] astray we have turned everyone up to his
[9:45] own way and the Lord had laid on him the
[9:48] iniquity of us all see it's all not
[9:50] Isaiah 53 now you'll get if you listen
[9:53] to the Masterpiece and see not a to sh
[9:56] is not all just
[9:57] pertaining to Jesus the the man Christ
[10:01] you know Jesus it goes into the bride
[10:03] all
[10:04] right he was oppressed and he was
[10:06] afflicted yet he have opened not his
[10:08] mouth he was brought as a lamb to the
[10:10] slaughter and as a sheep before her
[10:12] Shear as his dumb so he openeth not his
[10:15] mouth he was taken from prison and from
[10:17] judgment and who shall declare his
[10:20] generation for he was cut off out of the
[10:23] land of the living for the transgression
[10:25] of my people was he stricken and he made
[10:29] his grave with the wicked and with the
[10:30] rich in his debt because he ha done no
[10:33] violence neither was any deceit in his
[10:36] mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise
[10:38] him he ha put him to grief when thou
[10:42] shalt make his soul an offering for sin
[10:45] he shall see his seed right back up
[10:48] above there who shall declare his
[10:50] generation but when that happens he
[10:52] shall see his seed he shall prolong his
[10:54] days and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[10:56] prosper in his hand he shall see the
[10:58] travail of his soul and shall be
[11:01] satisfied by his knowledge shall my
[11:05] righteous servant justify many for he
[11:07] shall bear their iniquities therefore I
[11:10] will divide him a portion with a great
[11:14] and he shall divide the spoil with the
[11:16] strong because he ha poured out his soul
[11:19] into death and he was numbered with the
[11:22] transgressors and he bared the sin of
[11:24] many and made intercession for the
[11:27] transgressors you may be seated the Lord
[11:30] had his Blessing to the reading of the
[11:34] word
[11:39] now as I said and we will get even to
[11:42] more things into to this on
[11:45] Isaiah and see that it's not just
[11:48] talking
[11:49] of Jesus the Flesh and is coming into
[11:52] the world but it's showing the whole
[11:54] amen Plan of Redemption everything from
[11:57] the beginning all the way to the ending
[11:59] that's right it's showing everything
[12:01] coming down in Isaiah
[12:04] 53 and that was the scripture that the
[12:07] prophet used when he was preaching the
[12:11] Masterpiece all right I ask you to
[12:14] listen to the Masterpiece or the seed
[12:16] not a with a Shook and uh you know that
[12:20] way you would have a a better
[12:23] understanding of what uh I'm trying to
[12:26] say and as I tell talking we was a
[12:29] little bit last night see I can put a
[12:31] quote up here on the screen and I told
[12:34] them I can change down underneath this
[12:36] quote to make it say what I want it to
[12:39] say that's right you know what and you
[12:42] read it and think it's paragraph 44
[12:46] Masterpiece and it might not even be
[12:48] anything whatsoever but if you've read
[12:51] the book or listen to the tape you know
[12:55] whether or not what I'm saying is truth
[12:58] that's right all right and see that's
[13:00] why I desire for you to do that and and
[13:02] I got it a little rough there at the end
[13:04] I went back and listened to it I don't
[13:06] think my attitude was wrong but you
[13:08] probably did but I said listen to the
[13:11] Masterpiece or see not a with a Shook
[13:14] You Know by the next weekend and that
[13:16] way you know if not don't come because
[13:19] you're not interested in uh wanting to
[13:23] hear well that may be a little tough but
[13:26] uh the apology that I give is that I
[13:29] don't want to get into the category
[13:30] you're in cuz if your category is that
[13:33] well bless God ain't nobody going to
[13:35] tell me what to do well I don't want to
[13:37] get in that attitude so I won't be
[13:38] telling you what to do anymore brother
[13:41] Al is the only one in the church really
[13:43] that ever calls me and wants to know
[13:45] exactly what messages to read related to
[13:50] the things that I'm preaching so if you
[13:51] want to know any more you'll call me cuz
[13:54] I'm not going to get in the same
[13:55] attitude you're in of being that part
[13:58] I'm going to be what I can be but I
[14:01] still meant what I said that if you're
[14:03] not interested in
[14:05] listening then uh you know you're
[14:10] just you're creating problems all right
[14:13] so you take your little pey pad in P all
[14:15] you want to but
[14:18] now we want to talk and it'll be two or
[14:21] three maybe I don't know four or five
[14:23] Services I really don't know but we're
[14:25] going to talk about the Masterpiece
[14:27] family amen
[14:30] and we'll go through a lot of it to try
[14:33] to cover some things but what I want to
[14:36] do today is just start with it and and
[14:40] show you where we're
[14:41] going right kind of like I did with the
[14:44] uh predestination form is to just kind
[14:47] of cover it over all view and then we'll
[14:50] drop back and start picking up some of
[14:53] the things that is there but we were
[14:56] discussing it last night at the Bible
[14:58] study and and it's an odd way of brother
[15:01] brandham saying things if you ever
[15:02] notice when he got to the seed shall not
[15:05] be IR with a shook now that's the one in
[15:07] in Los Angeles uh because the one in
[15:10] Jeffersonville he said seed is not air
[15:12] with a shook uh you know and in doing
[15:17] that why did he title it like
[15:22] that why did he title it the seed is not
[15:25] air with a shook
[15:30] why was not his title the shook cannot
[15:33] be aired with a
[15:36] seed but he titled it that way then he
[15:38] when he preaches it again he titles it
[15:42] the same way you know that seed shall
[15:43] not be a with a
[15:45] Shook and why would he title it like
[15:49] that and then preach a message about the
[15:52] bride of
[15:56] Christ true see that you
[16:00] know it's he titled it the way he wanted
[16:04] it because that's exactly what he was
[16:06] showing the seed is not going to be hir
[16:09] with a Shook You know the shu's going
[16:11] into
[16:13] tribulation the Shu will stand to White
[16:15] Throne judgment that's right I'm talking
[16:17] about the dried up going on we're going
[16:20] to cover that today and get into it but
[16:24] see it won't be air and then why would
[16:27] he keep emphasizing throughout the
[16:30] message of Masterpiece and Seed not air
[16:33] with a
[16:35] shook
[16:38] that Matthew 24 is
[16:41] involved and that the whole world would
[16:43] be
[16:44] deceived did you catch that and listen
[16:47] to it he covers Matthew 24 see that it
[16:51] come a time see that it would deceive
[16:54] everything but the
[16:55] elect
[16:57] right see he's covering a message but
[17:01] what would make it so close
[17:05] right that if we're not careful we're
[17:08] going to be
[17:10] deceived by the way the Masterpiece
[17:16] comes come on you if you listen to the
[17:19] message you know he said
[17:22] it all right now why is it then and I'll
[17:27] say this and I'll get off of it
[17:29] right why is it then that you see in
[17:32] your message realm of
[17:35] people that you got a lot of
[17:38] Pentecostalism yeah right and I'm not
[17:41] against it cuz I believe in it firmly
[17:44] amen you know nobody in this building
[17:47] believes in manifestations greater than
[17:49] the man you're looking at right now
[17:51] because I've seen God I don't have to
[17:53] worry about that amen all right but my
[17:56] point is why does everybody want to deal
[17:58] with
[18:00] Pentecostalism and what I say about
[18:02] Pentecostalism is you want to be built
[18:05] up you want to run you want to do you
[18:06] want the Manifest and that's all well
[18:09] and good but what about the word brother
[18:13] asked me yesterday he
[18:15] said what do you think about this I said
[18:19] well brother the way I see most people
[18:21] of the message they have come up to a
[18:23] situation of like almost a pente
[18:27] Pentecostalism
[18:28] of just they don't want to go on with
[18:30] the
[18:31] word you know oh yeah they'll tell you
[18:34] they want to go on with the word but
[18:35] then you start talking about Daniel 70
[18:37] weeks seals marriage and divorce seed
[18:42] Etc oh they just back up we don't want
[18:45] to get into them deep
[18:47] things we might get
[18:51] confused wouldn't that be Pentecostalism
[18:54] right because remember right the shu is
[18:58] just before the seed comes into view
[19:00] amen
[19:02] right and the seed's not going to
[19:04] denominate that's right CU if you heard
[19:06] the prophet on them he said there's no
[19:08] more denominations after this that's why
[19:10] he said you can't denominate this
[19:12] message right he said but they'll
[19:15] organize it into lady oia right is that
[19:19] a quote amen see organize the message in
[19:23] in other words stop what did he say
[19:25] about Pentecost he said isusa Street
[19:28] Pentecost cabbaged down on the
[19:31] word well then the way I look at the
[19:33] message people most of them are cabbaged
[19:36] down because they will not talk to you
[19:38] about anything other than their little
[19:41] realm of
[19:43] protection that they stay
[19:46] in all
[19:47] right but see could that be why I
[19:50] brother around
[19:53] says and using that that you could be
[19:55] deceived
[20:01] just leave that up to
[20:03] you but now think about
[20:07] it the Masterpiece family so let's just
[20:10] cover it as an overall View and then we
[20:14] will drop back and pick up the things of
[20:17] where the Prophet would speak of
[20:20] carriers and how that he would make the
[20:23] denominations
[20:26] carrier amen and he would make the
[20:30] prophets
[20:33] carriers and he would say Mary is not
[20:37] the seed she's a
[20:40] carrier
[20:42] sir why would he be talking like that if
[20:46] you listen to the message you heard
[20:52] him and let me say something while I'm
[20:54] at
[20:55] it when we get into the seed and start
[20:58] talking about it and we we speak about
[21:02] it a
[21:04] little Jesus in the
[21:07] scriptures he said unless
[21:10] that corn good to see our visitors with
[21:13] us come on in
[21:17] welcome he said there was a corn of
[21:22] wheat right unless the corn of wheat
[21:25] dies falls into the ground it'll abide
[21:28] alone right all right amen now corn he
[21:30] said a corn of
[21:32] wheat now there's difference in corn and
[21:35] wheat right
[21:38] right why is he saying a corn of wheat
[21:41] right
[21:43] amen have you ever looked up the word
[21:49] corn I mean you you ever just looked up
[21:51] the word no I know what it is I eat it
[21:52] all the time well that's real
[21:55] good but have you ever looked up what
[21:58] the word horn
[21:59] says I'm talking about in the the
[22:05] uh daglock you know some
[22:10] sometimes the right translation would be
[22:13] to say a grain of wheat amen because the
[22:18] word
[22:19] corn it says the an the original says
[22:24] grain right so now Jesus is right he's
[22:27] not saying a corn of Wheat and don't
[22:29] understand the difference between wheat
[22:30] and
[22:31] corn he's telling you about a grain of
[22:35] corn right and that'll be the whole
[22:37] point that we'll get at the message
[22:39] today one grain of
[22:43] corn goes into the
[22:46] ground right comes forth in a multiple
[22:52] form right y right amen but now when you
[22:55] start to plant again
[23:00] now we'll go through it and come down
[23:01] through the message when you start to
[23:03] plant
[23:04] again you still just planting one grain
[23:07] of
[23:08] wheat right no I plant a whole row a
[23:12] whole handful there's all each one of
[23:15] them is a
[23:17] grain they're not tied
[23:20] together they're
[23:22] self-sufficient that's
[23:24] right so it's a grain of wheat amen
[23:29] all right a grain of wheat as we always
[23:31] say to the visitors when they come you
[23:33] come one time we say welcome and you
[23:36] come two times you just part of it so
[23:38] that's we always do that but think about
[23:41] it
[23:42] now we read in Isaiah and talking about
[23:46] a masterpiece
[23:48] family all
[23:52] right this masterpiece family started
[23:56] out
[23:59] in the Garden of Eden
[24:02] amen when God created Adam and Eve amen
[24:07] right amen a masterpiece family right
[24:10] okay starting there
[24:14] then he put
[24:16] them behind the word amen that's right
[24:21] right amen they had his word to live by
[24:24] right all right he told them don't eat
[24:26] of this tree don't do this different
[24:28] things you
[24:30] know but they were fortified behind the
[24:33] word amen but from that what's reason
[24:38] it's a masterpiece family is because he
[24:40] created
[24:42] Adam and he created Adam according to
[24:45] Genesis male and female created he him
[24:48] amen all right then created he them see
[24:51] because Eve was in Adam right Amen in
[24:54] the original creation all right now
[24:59] God had to Smite the side of Adam or to
[25:03] operate as we call today more common
[25:06] language strike him and take
[25:09] out and he took Eve from Adam amen right
[25:14] all right as we get through it then you
[25:16] watch that's not a bad thing because
[25:18] that was the way that God intended for
[25:20] it to be because it would speak of all
[25:22] the other times
[25:25] amen because the the you remember the
[25:28] the reason or the the point behind the
[25:30] Masterpiece was when the prophet was
[25:33] saying that he had seen the statue that
[25:37] Michelangelo made of
[25:40] Moses and remember what it was it was a
[25:42] beautiful statue and thing but on the
[25:44] knee of that statue there is a a little
[25:48] Mark Mar you know like a little chip
[25:51] because Moses got so as behind the story
[25:54] he got so involved in seeing years and
[25:57] years and years of work
[25:59] sitting before him until he actually got
[26:02] beside himself and he said he hid it
[26:05] with a with the Chisel thing you know
[26:07] and said
[26:09] speak and see that's what made it a
[26:12] masterpiece no no doubt it was a great
[26:15] thing a great piece of art but yet what
[26:18] made it the Masterpiece was he got so
[26:22] involved until he
[26:24] seen what he had in his mind for years
[26:28] come on brother you know amen was
[26:31] finally sitting before him amen and he
[26:34] said speak all right so then we know
[26:37] that's what made it a masterpiece on we
[26:40] see what made it a masterpiece in the
[26:41] garden was when he put Adam to
[26:44] sleep and took from Adam and made Eve am
[26:50] didn't take from the like the rest of
[26:52] the animals were created they would be
[26:54] created male and female you know and all
[26:56] like that and and each one being
[26:59] different because he create the male he
[27:00] create the female but when he come to
[27:03] Adam he created Adam and he placed in
[27:05] Adam the male and female parts that was
[27:08] needed not outside the exteriors but in
[27:11] the spirit of
[27:13] Adam and when he smok Adam or put him to
[27:17] sleep took out that rib and made Eve
[27:20] then Eve was not a different
[27:23] creation
[27:25] amen she was a part of the original
[27:27] creation
[27:28] all right keep that in mind as we go
[27:30] along she was a part of the original she
[27:32] was part of Adam Adam said now she's
[27:35] bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh
[27:38] all right her DNA would have been
[27:42] what the same as Adam it would not have
[27:45] been Eve as a separate thing cuz he made
[27:47] her that way but he put her put them
[27:50] then behind the word and it was
[27:53] beautiful they were there in the garden
[27:55] that they could come down and God could
[27:57] come down and fellowship with with them
[27:58] in the cool of the evening and and have
[28:00] a wonderful time and they were in
[28:03] complete control of all animal life and
[28:06] all of the things because it had already
[28:08] said that in Genesis amen all right but
[28:12] the the part that made it a masterpiece
[28:14] was that he took from Adam right and
[28:18] made the Masterpiece or family placed it
[28:22] there behind the word
[28:24] yes all right but here comes Satan as he
[28:28] comes
[28:30] along and using the form of the Beast
[28:33] that it speaks of which was not a monkey
[28:38] neither was it a snake amen get all that
[28:41] out of your
[28:43] mind we don't believe in in uh Evolution
[28:46] like Darwin but we believe in Creative
[28:49] Evolution all right creative evolution
[28:51] is God created one and another one
[28:54] another one another one another one well
[28:56] then that's where Darwin could never
[28:58] find a link between man and the monkey
[29:02] that was his problem but if he'd read
[29:04] the Bible he would have found that there
[29:06] was a beast amen there in the garden
[29:09] amen the Bible says a serpent was the
[29:11] most sub of all Beast there's a
[29:12] difference serpent that's a
[29:15] snake Beast is an upright creature all
[29:18] right so that was the point of what was
[29:21] missed that's right and through the
[29:23] Beast you know Satan using that
[29:27] Beast he was able to get EV away from
[29:30] the word right amen that's true and she
[29:32] fell amen righten and when that fall
[29:36] came it brought all
[29:40] mankind under that lost condition
[29:44] amen all
[29:47] right then see that's why Paul tell him
[29:50] not for the women not to preach and
[29:51] things why because they were
[29:54] deceived right we don't have any
[29:57] problems amen we just stay with the word
[29:59] amen all right but see even though that
[30:04] happened it looked like a bad day when
[30:08] when Adam and Eve was put out of the
[30:11] garden and it was and they were on their
[30:14] way out with those bloody skins of the
[30:18] animals that had been placed upon
[30:21] them but as they were going out God said
[30:25] what Genesis 3:15
[30:28] I will put enmity between thy
[30:30] seed and the seed of the
[30:33] woman and it'll bruise thy head and I'll
[30:35] bruise his heel th shall bruise his heel
[30:37] that was actually speaking in the Bible
[30:40] of the first time amen of the coming of
[30:43] Jesus Christ that's right all right
[30:46] because that was the promise that he
[30:48] would come and take away the sin of
[30:50] mankind that they had happened in the
[30:53] garden all right so then we know that
[30:55] God wasn't going to leave it
[30:58] right so that's why we titled
[31:00] Masterpiece family see he wasn't going
[31:02] to leave it that way right so he set out
[31:07] immediately to try to change
[31:12] things we come over and there was Cain
[31:15] and there was Abel the two that was born
[31:19] from and as we do then we see that they
[31:22] started
[31:23] worshiping
[31:25] right we come over to Noah it was
[31:28] working pretty good but yet still it was
[31:31] a conditional
[31:34] situation Adam and Eve was told don't
[31:37] eat of this you can eat of that right
[31:41] ate of the wrong that's caused a problem
[31:43] all right so then when it come over to
[31:45] Noah you're still under a conditional
[31:48] Covenant and man was having
[31:52] troubles all right then you jump over a
[31:56] little further into scripture and you
[31:58] find a man named
[32:00] Abraham it was Abram to start with his
[32:02] name was changed and made to
[32:04] Abraham and we see that God started with
[32:07] Abraham with an unconditional
[32:10] Covenant he said I've already done it he
[32:14] put Abraham to sleep when he gave him
[32:17] the Covenant and said I've already done
[32:19] it all right see then he's going to
[32:22] restore his Masterpiece
[32:25] family so he starts with Abraham
[32:29] and as he brings it to
[32:32] Abraham he then Abraham was a a great
[32:36] he's called the father of Faith you know
[32:39] we talk about Abraham's bosom you know
[32:42] that he calls it about the Old Testament
[32:44] it wasn't in his belly it's talking
[32:45] about his faith yes the faith that he
[32:48] had provided a place right all right but
[32:51] God wasn't going to let that Masterpiece
[32:53] that fell in the garden stay down so he
[32:56] started with Abraham
[32:58] and just like the Monument of
[33:01] Moses you know the the stature
[33:04] of Michaelangelo made he put it on a
[33:08] block
[33:11] Foundation right God started out now if
[33:15] you if you listened to the message I'm
[33:17] just looking down the page
[33:20] reading if you listen to the message
[33:22] Masterpiece see you not I with a shook
[33:24] you can follow me right through all
[33:26] right
[33:28] and he started in Abraham to restore the
[33:31] Masterpiece on an unconditional
[33:33] Covenant because he knew man couldn't
[33:36] keep his
[33:37] covenants they couldn't do it he even
[33:39] had a lot of goof UPS under the
[33:41] unconditional you know a lot of problems
[33:44] in
[33:45] mankind but he put it on a
[33:48] foundation and that Foundation was what
[33:51] right the Patriarchs which is Abraham
[33:54] Isaac Jacob Joseph
[33:58] right so he made a foundation right he's
[34:02] going to build a masterpiece amen he
[34:05] laid a foundation Abraham was
[34:08] Faith right Isaac
[34:12] love Jacob Grace absolutely right amen
[34:17] and Joseph Perfection amen why because
[34:20] you know the story back there in the
[34:21] Bible to the new ones just thinking on
[34:23] it Abraham is a father of faith
[34:28] so you put your foundation you draw it
[34:29] out you put it down Abraham Isaac Jacob
[34:33] Joseph Abraham was Faith Isaac was love
[34:38] why because that was the promised
[34:40] son that even though they messed up and
[34:42] trying to get it here with Hagar and
[34:44] everything
[34:46] else you finally turned out to be the
[34:49] love of God Amen down
[34:52] to to Bringing forth in
[34:55] Isaac then in Jacob
[34:59] Jacob was a Shyer Tripper uper deceiving
[35:02] his father deceiving everybody right
[35:04] stealing the birthrights doing all kind
[35:06] of thing right but yet God had Grace
[35:10] upon Jacob that's right amen God took
[35:14] care of Jacob amen God brought Jacob
[35:16] back from his journey when he was
[35:18] leaving going away cuz his brother was
[35:20] wanting to kill him and we there in the
[35:23] Bible in Genesis read it am and he was
[35:25] doing it it was Grace yes all right but
[35:29] Joseph turn out to be Perfection amen
[35:32] because Joseph was a perfect type of
[35:35] Christ right right come on in other
[35:38] words an example of Christ amen showing
[35:41] Christ and he was
[35:43] Perfection the only flaw that you find
[35:45] in Joseph's
[35:48] life is the one that he done
[35:51] which remember they were sheep
[35:54] herders they was coming down to Egypt
[35:58] Egyptians hated sheep
[36:00] herders remember all the whole story how
[36:04] they was out and Joseph finally made
[36:06] contact with his Brethren and he brought
[36:08] his daddy in he told his daddy he said
[36:11] tell them
[36:13] Egyptians that your cattle
[36:16] risers don't tell them you're sheep
[36:19] herders in other words there was no way
[36:23] that they wouldn't going to find out
[36:24] they were but at least let me get a
[36:27] little chance to get things settled with
[36:30] all these Egyptians around here and Me
[36:31] In Charge cuz remember Joseph was the
[36:35] number two man in Egypt he'd been sold
[36:38] into slavery but he he wound up being LA
[36:41] and bow the KNE to Joseph all right but
[36:44] he said now you just uh you just tell
[36:47] them that you're cattle herders and
[36:49] after a while we can bring the Sheep
[36:52] down but we're not going to bring them
[36:54] down right now we're going to leave them
[36:56] out there because we don't want to get
[36:57] and people mad at us right and see that
[37:00] was his
[37:01] flaw so there's another
[37:04] Mark there's another
[37:06] strike but yet it it made a perfect
[37:09] Foundation amen all right through the
[37:11] Patriarchs as we call but then the the
[37:15] body work of this
[37:18] masterpiece was the prophets right the
[37:22] prophets built the body as we would call
[37:24] it you remember in Hebrews u 10 five
[37:28] said a body thou Hast prepared me all
[37:32] right in an example form to show then we
[37:36] come down
[37:37] through and that Old Testament as those
[37:40] prophets as they begin to bring the word
[37:44] thus sayith the Lord thus sayith the
[37:45] Lord the word was being built it winds
[37:49] up coming down all the way through those
[37:50] prophets they were actually bringing
[37:53] forth a conditional situation
[37:57] that God could walk
[37:59] upon to make a perfect
[38:02] Masterpiece all right so they were
[38:04] building him a body right right the last
[38:08] one in the Old Testament was who John
[38:11] the
[38:13] Baptist John the Baptist was a l one
[38:16] yeah right he come to do
[38:18] what what was John's job was to
[38:23] introduce the perfect Masterpiece of all
[38:26] masterpieces
[38:27] right got you remember he introduced
[38:30] Jesus Christ right you remember when he
[38:32] was on the the out in the water he said
[38:34] Behold the Lamb of God that takes away
[38:36] the sin of the world
[38:38] Amen he was the head of all the Old
[38:40] Testament people amen right and see
[38:44] there stands then your perfect
[38:45] Masterpiece
[38:47] amen all
[38:49] right almighty God in human flesh not a
[38:54] second person or a third person or
[38:56] anything go with we don't believe in
[38:57] trinitarianism right we don't believe in
[39:00] the the doctrine of God in three persons
[39:02] Blessed Trinity co-equal and coeternal
[39:05] don't believe that cuz it's ain't even
[39:07] sensible How could a father be the same
[39:09] age of a
[39:10] son see father son Holy Ghost Co equal
[39:13] coeternal I ain't even sensible I ain't
[39:15] nowh in the Bible amen that's
[39:17] right Jesus said unless you believe that
[39:20] I am he you'll die in your
[39:23] sins amen he was either almighty God in
[39:25] human flesh or he was a liar right amen
[39:29] right well see then he the Masterpiece
[39:32] stood
[39:34] there he took him and and went through
[39:37] his
[39:38] life and he lived his life for you and I
[39:42] amen
[39:43] God wanted to know what it was like to
[39:46] feel
[39:48] pain right he couldn't feel pain he
[39:51] couldn't feel those things as in his
[39:53] existence as Elohim self-existing
[39:55] almighty God Spirit God as we'd call him
[39:58] or whatever
[40:00] right and he he couldn't feel it so he
[40:03] had to come down in human flesh yes Amen
[40:07] to be able to live in human flesh am the
[40:11] Bible calls him my brother amen he calls
[40:13] him my redeemer My Kinsman yes God come
[40:19] down in human flesh that's why it says
[40:22] you know in Isaiah the Virgin shall
[40:25] conceive
[40:27] and that it would be Emmanuel as we
[40:29] coming on over into the New Testament to
[40:31] pick it up God With
[40:34] Us well brother Dale I've always been
[40:36] taught he was a second person yeah
[40:38] you've been taught that because that you
[40:41] you ain't never studied the truth of the
[40:43] word
[40:44] amen well who are you to tell I ain't me
[40:46] I'm just I'm just telling you what the
[40:48] Bible says the Bible said he was
[40:50] Emmanuel God With
[40:53] Us well now it was a Son of God now show
[40:56] me in the where it's ever talked about
[40:58] God the son I want a scripture for
[41:03] that I want a scripture where it says
[41:05] God a son there's no such thing they
[41:08] called him Son of God right why because
[41:12] that's who he was who are you by the new
[41:15] birth do you not believe that the new
[41:17] birth puts God in you well then are you
[41:19] not Sons and Daughters of God well there
[41:22] any problem with Jesus being God no the
[41:25] Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of
[41:27] the godhead
[41:30] bodily
[41:32] right well see then that was the
[41:34] Masterpiece that was standing there that
[41:37] Old Testament gave birth as we' call
[41:40] it they laid the word down put that word
[41:43] in order all of those prophets coming up
[41:46] was just one on the other stacking up
[41:48] stacking up coming up with the word
[41:50] until you come to John to
[41:52] introduce but see then when he come into
[41:54] the world what did he do
[41:57] three and A2 years are the worst
[41:59] Ministry could ever be thought of him
[42:02] right constantly trying their best to
[42:04] kill him for
[42:06] what they said you're a man making
[42:08] yourself
[42:09] God no that was back exactly backwards
[42:12] he was God making himself a
[42:15] man he was coming on Earth that's why we
[42:17] don't believe we believe in the one true
[42:19] and living
[42:20] God not to God in three persons Blessed
[42:23] Trinity show me the TR word Trinity in
[42:24] the Bible that's right it's it's not
[42:27] there but he bringing a
[42:30] masterpiece a masterpiece was standing
[42:34] there but yet before it got too far into
[42:37] his ministry what did he say he himself
[42:40] said as I was covering to start with
[42:42] that a grain or a corn of
[42:46] wheat unless it dies and goes into the
[42:49] ground it'll abide alone which meant was
[42:53] showing that he would have to die y
[42:55] right right right so he came to taste
[42:58] death for you and I to take death and
[43:00] Conquer it all right so then when he
[43:04] did he said that corn of whe is going to
[43:06] have to go in the ground or else it's
[43:08] going to B alone that's right well he
[43:11] was prophesying of his own death that
[43:14] would have to come amen that's all right
[43:17] he winds up on Mount
[43:21] Transfiguration where even God himself
[43:23] Witnesses down this is my beloved Son in
[43:25] whom I'm pleased to dwell
[43:27] hear ye him
[43:29] amen Matthew
[43:32] 17 and as he does he's there but
[43:35] remember now to be the
[43:38] Masterpiece you're going to have to have
[43:40] the SMY amen that's right because you
[43:43] had to have the
[43:45] removal of Eve from Adam to make it a
[43:48] masterpiece family so if he abided alone
[43:52] there wouldn't be anything else so what
[43:53] had to happen he had to be taken to
[43:55] Calvary to be smitten amen
[43:59] right why did he have to be smitten cuz
[44:02] you and I was in him amen right
[44:05] remember we didn't come here with him
[44:08] and us as people are trying to say we
[44:11] came here in him in the eternal life
[44:15] that he has it's dwelling in you and I
[44:17] by the new birth all right so he was
[44:21] smitten that the bride could come out am
[44:24] that's right all right
[44:28] see where the bride that was in him
[44:30] because that would be the same with
[44:32] Adam Eve was removed from Adam to make a
[44:37] family right so to be a masterpiece
[44:39] family see then when Jesus Christ was
[44:42] crucified you and I the spiritual part
[44:45] of you and I of the the eternal life not
[44:48] our physical beings or what we are or
[44:52] something but that was in Jesus Christ
[44:54] and had to be removed amen cuz
[44:58] remember that when he come up there he
[45:01] was to
[45:04] speak
[45:05] right when he was
[45:07] smitten you remember
[45:10] Moses Michelangelo got so excited he hit
[45:13] that statue and he said
[45:15] speak cuz he's seen there in front of
[45:18] him all of his years's
[45:22] work all those toiling hours of year
[45:25] after year of slowly working on that
[45:29] Monument it's not no 40 stories tall it
[45:32] didn't take him that long that way it
[45:34] was just a fact his sister's kind of a
[45:36] small little bitty thing you know I mean
[45:40] I don't know exactly but he 3 or 4 foot
[45:42] tall is all it is but he put all of his
[45:44] life working in
[45:46] that and when he seen his whole mind
[45:49] right there in view of what he saw like
[45:52] they said somebody asked him said when
[45:54] he bought got the stone you know said
[45:56] well what do you all I see is a chunk of
[46:00] stone you know he said I see
[46:04] Moses cuz that was in his mind what
[46:06] Moses looked like nobody knowed what he
[46:08] looked like but in his mind he he
[46:11] visualized it when he did it was
[46:13] finished all right so it is in Jesus
[46:20] Christ he had to be smitten for you and
[46:23] I to come out amen but when he was
[46:25] smitten remember in Moses mes he said
[46:29] speak well I'll get back to it one of
[46:32] these
[46:33] years I'll preached on it before you
[46:35] know
[46:37] it the thing's in Reverse when you go
[46:40] through the Life of Christ because when
[46:42] you wind up at the end of The Life of
[46:44] Christ he
[46:46] smitten the
[46:48] calvary when does he speak
[46:53] right you had to come in Bride for him
[46:55] to speak right that's right right so
[46:59] that means there's more to come you
[47:00] remember
[47:02] amen Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph could
[47:04] put a foundation there's more to come
[47:06] amen the prophets built a body there's
[47:09] more to come right he had to stand on
[47:13] Earth but there's more to come because
[47:15] it's a master oface family
[47:19] yes see he was smitten at Calvary that
[47:22] you and I could come forth because
[47:25] that's where they received eternal life
[47:26] on the day of Pentecost right that's
[47:28] right a masterpiece family amen he had a
[47:32] wonderful church built upon the
[47:35] word right he had his Masterpiece in
[47:39] Jesus
[47:41] Christ right standing there but then
[47:44] when you put it on the day of Pentecost
[47:45] brother brandham says what said there's
[47:48] his Masterpiece
[47:51] family and it was a beautiful
[47:52] Masterpiece family that he had
[47:57] but there was another saying that had to
[47:59] come into
[48:01] being because when Jesus was here he
[48:04] said unless a corn of
[48:05] wheat die and go into the ground said
[48:09] it'll B
[48:10] alone right Joel had already spoken it
[48:14] right I will restore the years of the
[48:18] Locust canor pomor
[48:21] caterpillar it already been said by the
[48:24] prophets so somebody's got a fulfill it
[48:28] and did you hear this part that was in
[48:29] there as you listening brother
[48:34] said the Old Testament was made manifest
[48:39] by Jesus Christ you remember that now
[48:41] absolutely all right but he said in
[48:46] dire would come forth a
[48:49] masterpiece in the New Testament and
[48:52] it's up to the bride of Christ to
[48:54] fulfill the New Testament right you
[48:57] remember that statement cuz see that's
[48:59] what's taking
[49:00] place coming to the
[49:05] point that it would be talking
[49:07] about the son of
[49:10] man who was that Jesus said unless you
[49:13] believe that I am he all right then he
[49:15] talk who who do Man say that I am the
[49:18] son of man was who he was right the son
[49:21] of man had to die on Calvary the word
[49:23] made flesh went to Calvary all right so
[49:28] then it would start off on the
[49:30] Masterpiece that she would start off as
[49:34] being on the day of Pentecost to make
[49:38] the New Testament come into being it's
[49:40] going to have to wind up with a son of
[49:42] man all right so we have to hold that
[49:44] till we get down but yet there she comes
[49:48] forth and she's the
[49:51] word but that word's got to go into the
[49:53] ground or you and I wouldn't be here
[49:56] right
[49:58] so in the Dark
[49:59] Ages it began to go into the ground when
[50:02] the Catholic Church took when the bride
[50:04] the prophet said and you heard it over
[50:05] and over I know people don't agree with
[50:07] that totally but that's what he said he
[50:09] said the bride went into the ground at n
[50:12] you he said she started taking dogmas
[50:14] and ideas and opinions and things
[50:18] right but yet a lot of people say well
[50:20] no what they' done is yeah they went up
[50:22] there and they left and come back but
[50:23] they brought back with them that's right
[50:27] that seed was already planted at that
[50:29] first Nan Council because the argument
[50:33] at Nan Council was not over one God or
[50:35] three Gods it was over the fact of
[50:38] whether Jesus was God or a like
[50:42] substance study your 325 ad in your nan
[50:46] counsil and see even they wrote the
[50:48] decree that Jesus was almighty
[50:53] God but yet the word had already been
[50:56] planted in unbelief it didn't been put
[50:57] into the mind you say into the bride
[51:00] your Prophet said the bride went into
[51:02] the ground at n see a Rome why she had
[51:07] to go into the
[51:09] ground come
[51:12] on yeah but what I believe it was that
[51:14] they killed them
[51:16] all
[51:18] no how come they wound up being so far
[51:20] off the word that's it
[51:23] right until Luther come out with a just
[51:25] you live by faith
[51:28] looks like somebody would have held on
[51:30] to something
[51:31] yeah from Martin over to Luther looked
[51:34] like it held on to something but they
[51:37] didn't but you see Church your Prophet
[51:39] is when that says these things not
[51:42] me that the bride went into the ground
[51:44] at
[51:46] NAA she forfeited her right why because
[51:50] she like
[51:54] Eve come on she like Eve could not stay
[51:58] with the
[51:59] word it was not Adam it wasn't Adam's
[52:02] fault in the garden right Eve the Bible
[52:04] said was deceived said Adam was not
[52:06] deceived he knew exactly what he was
[52:09] doing see Jesus Christ wasn't deceived
[52:12] right but the early church started out
[52:14] beautiful and wonderful a masterpiece
[52:16] family
[52:19] yes but as it did she started dwindling
[52:23] away she started taking man's ideas amen
[52:27] opinions and getting away from the word
[52:28] of God until you get on over there it it
[52:33] comes into that for church
[52:36] age she's dying and going into the
[52:39] ground why because she's already began
[52:42] why because that's what Joel was
[52:46] saying that's what Joel was saying I
[52:50] will restore the years of the can of
[52:52] worm borm Locust
[52:54] caterpillar right right
[52:58] as it did that church at
[53:00] Rome she begin
[53:03] to not look too much like a
[53:07] masterpiece but don't worry about it she
[53:09] still was right do see everybody wants
[53:12] to bring a little bitty Channel down to
[53:14] there and they can't get to it we were
[53:16] talking about it last night I wish
[53:17] everybody would have been
[53:20] there to listen to what was said last
[53:24] night you take a corn of wheat we'll get
[53:27] to it later and come
[53:30] back when you plant wheat or corn either
[53:33] way you want to go with
[53:35] it the two shoots that comes
[53:38] up we'll get to it in a minute
[53:40] represented Luther right the just shall
[53:43] live by faith the stalk
[53:47] Wesley the
[53:48] shook
[53:50] Pentecost all
[53:53] right but don't cut that corn or that
[53:56] wheat heat plant down amen just because
[53:59] you look up at the top and think you got
[54:02] wheat cuz you could have a shook but
[54:05] even if you got a full head of wheat be
[54:07] careful when you cut it
[54:11] down and like I was trying to explain to
[54:14] them last night and a lot of them said
[54:15] they hadn't thought about
[54:17] it them two shoots that comes up you
[54:19] know the little PL they're
[54:23] green cuz life was there
[54:27] stalk comes up it's
[54:29] green it don't turn brown when it first
[54:32] comes up it's green cornner wheat either
[54:35] way you go yes that's
[54:40] right the leaves that come off your corn
[54:42] stays green until
[54:48] what sh comes on it's green
[54:53] right right y the husk could wheat is
[54:59] green the forming of the wheat in the
[55:03] husk right that's it's got to be there
[55:05] and totally formed and that's got to
[55:08] remain around it then it starts drying
[55:10] up right amen there's life there until
[55:14] then right
[55:17] amen see we got our own ideas we think
[55:20] well when they denominated they died you
[55:22] got
[55:23] quotes what about a prophet saying about
[55:26] 62 he said the Baptist is just now
[55:28] become a
[55:30] denomination you argue with
[55:33] him you argue with him when he calls the
[55:36] denominations
[55:40] carriers remember a carrier when it's a
[55:44] carrier is a work of
[55:47] God
[55:49] right just
[55:51] remember that stalk comes up that wheat
[55:55] when it starts
[55:57] forming it's still
[56:00] green stalk still
[56:03] green and all at once it starts drying
[56:07] up why because the wheat's being formed
[56:09] it's sucking all the life up into the
[56:11] wheat but you can't go cut it down CA
[56:13] it's half
[56:16] done Shuck's got to be there to protect
[56:18] it
[56:21] amen right that's
[56:24] right why because you're talking to
[56:26] about something being green a move of
[56:29] God and I've told you this before and
[56:31] this is what I believe see I don't
[56:33] believe the denominations was As Dead As
[56:35] you
[56:37] think until the when the and when the
[56:40] prophet brought his message then they
[56:42] started dying yeah that's right
[56:44] amen
[56:46] right they was still an ability to be
[56:48] saved out there
[56:51] right there was enough word being
[56:53] preached brother Ram never sent no
[56:55] Baptist message his Presbyterian to hell
[56:57] no that's right he said when they
[57:00] denominated they died right but does
[57:03] that mean everybody died you better look
[57:06] around folks you happen to be the ones
[57:10] coming from
[57:13] there that's right is it not true the
[57:16] prophet said if you Pentecostals won't
[57:18] go in said he raise up Baptist and M
[57:20] this look
[57:23] around
[57:24] right you better be careful how you cut
[57:27] down the stock you're going to cut
[57:28] yourself
[57:30] down that's right that's why people
[57:32] can't understand brother
[57:34] brandham when he would brag on the
[57:37] denomination he said there's nothing
[57:39] wrong with that he said but when they
[57:41] organize against the word right
[57:46] right he said it's not the people I'm
[57:48] against it's the what the system right
[57:52] that's
[57:53] right he went to the churches and
[57:55] preached to us
[57:58] amen right amen even the quote that I
[58:02] gave the other week that he said these
[58:03] young men will take this message and
[58:06] sweep it on to the coming of the Lord
[58:08] come right out of a Pentecostal church
[58:10] and read right before then if he
[58:12] wouldn't talking about that church and
[58:14] those people that sitting
[58:16] there you see we think we got it all
[58:19] figured
[58:20] out oh when they denominated they died
[58:24] word rejectors go to hell
[58:27] but evidently you and I must or not have
[58:29] been word
[58:32] rejectors oh
[58:35] right go word rejectors go to hell right
[58:39] right
[58:41] amen when they turn down Jesus's message
[58:44] where did they
[58:47] go so evidently there must have been
[58:49] some little life around or something a
[58:52] little something who was ability to
[58:55] live see but we got it all figured
[58:58] out you hear preachers up pre them
[59:00] denominations they just
[59:04] died well most of them did but you know
[59:07] in
[59:09] there there was a little life left
[59:11] called
[59:15] you if not where did you come
[59:19] from come
[59:21] on see that's why I wanted you to listen
[59:24] to the message
[59:26] and see if your Prophet said it then it
[59:29] wouldn't be me writing what I want to or
[59:31] reading what I want to off of a page and
[59:33] putting it up here that you think he
[59:35] said it now you're going to have to
[59:37] argue whether he said
[59:40] it not
[59:42] me would you see
[59:46] church that
[59:50] bride she begin to denominate and die
[59:54] away oh no you don't like that I know
[59:56] that you read it and see what you got to
[59:59] say about it well it was just that
[1:00:01] little just them one bad ones that no he
[1:00:05] said their
[1:00:06] denominations and he calls them
[1:00:10] carriers that's up to
[1:00:13] you but
[1:00:16] listen he gets into restoration of the
[1:00:18] brid tree and what does he say talking
[1:00:21] about that little bride that died and
[1:00:22] went into the
[1:00:24] ground he said there was four messengers
[1:00:27] of
[1:00:29] death that took that
[1:00:31] down cankerworm palmerworm Locust
[1:00:34] caterpillar I know he uses uh a
[1:00:37] different word over in the restoration
[1:00:39] of bride tree don't worry about it it's
[1:00:41] same what it is and in the Bible pmer
[1:00:45] Worm but do you see what I'm getting at
[1:00:48] yes that bride had to go into the
[1:00:52] ground or you and I wouldn't be here it
[1:00:54] would already done be over with right
[1:00:56] that's
[1:00:58] right yes sir Martin St Martin taught
[1:01:03] the godhead the things of this message
[1:01:05] exactly right the Bible
[1:01:08] amen why couldn't God just have dropped
[1:01:11] down and brought the seals right to him
[1:01:12] put the chains of the body there and
[1:01:14] took them
[1:01:16] off he had a masterpiece family that's
[1:01:19] what your Prophet calls it he has no
[1:01:21] problem calling them and saying they the
[1:01:24] true bride denominator ated he has no
[1:01:27] trouble saying and no trouble saying
[1:01:29] that there was a
[1:01:35] masterpiece why can't see that well read
[1:01:39] and see if I'm
[1:01:42] right but you see four messengers of
[1:01:45] death took it down they started eating
[1:01:47] what one 18
[1:01:49] to
[1:01:51] leaves one at the bark one8 the leaves
[1:01:55] one8 the fruit one ate the the sap out
[1:01:59] of the tree but it went down in the
[1:02:02] roots and The Roots didn't
[1:02:04] die just like in the fall of the year
[1:02:07] what happens everything starts turning
[1:02:09] brown starts going to way but where does
[1:02:12] the thing go down into the ground on a
[1:02:15] tree
[1:02:16] right are you with me four messengers of
[1:02:19] death but he said for messengers of Life
[1:02:22] restores the tree
[1:02:26] four messengers of life so you had four
[1:02:29] messengers of death they took it down
[1:02:31] they had to bark off they had to leaves
[1:02:33] off they had to the fruit and they ate
[1:02:34] the sap cleaned to it went into the
[1:02:36] ground as he was saying but he said in
[1:02:38] the ground was where it was at and he
[1:02:40] said you can't kill a gerti
[1:02:43] seed just because that this winter that
[1:02:46] trees went into the ground them apple
[1:02:47] trees peach trees
[1:02:50] Etc Oaks or whatever it didn't kill the
[1:02:53] whole tree did
[1:02:54] it sap went down in the
[1:02:57] ground spring of the year it come right
[1:03:00] back up and when it does everything will
[1:03:01] start being green
[1:03:03] again
[1:03:05] right but see he had a masterpiece
[1:03:07] family that went into the ground at n
[1:03:09] that's what I'm trying to get you to see
[1:03:11] cuz it was the full
[1:03:13] word
[1:03:15] right now you called it that the
[1:03:17] fullness of the word went into the
[1:03:22] ground but see then as it went into the
[1:03:24] ground there was for me of life and what
[1:03:26] was
[1:03:28] it all
[1:03:30] right what happened four messengers of
[1:03:36] Life what is those four messengers of
[1:03:40] life
[1:03:43] okay Luther brought just you live by
[1:03:46] faith the methodists come along with
[1:03:52] sanctification the Pentecostal come
[1:03:54] along with the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:57] Ghost but in the end time is to come
[1:03:59] back to the original
[1:04:01] word right amen four messengers of death
[1:04:06] four messengers of life to fulfill Joel
[1:04:09] that's right we ain't got time to read
[1:04:10] it you read Joel 2 23 through 30 through
[1:04:15] 32 and see if it's not talking about it
[1:04:18] amen it all went down bringing the tree
[1:04:24] down but there Li still in the bottom
[1:04:27] that's right all right and what
[1:04:29] happens so what did your Prophet say he
[1:04:33] said there four messengers of death
[1:04:34] killed the tree four messengers of Life
[1:04:36] restores the tree restore how by four
[1:04:39] Messengers killed it then four life
[1:04:42] Messengers will restore what was the
[1:04:44] first Martin Luther justification what
[1:04:47] was the second John Wesley s by
[1:04:49] sanctification what was the third
[1:04:51] Pentecost with the restoration of the
[1:04:52] gifts the Holy Ghost that's right right
[1:04:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost he said now
[1:04:57] paragraph 505 restoration of the Bride
[1:05:00] tree is where I'm reading from what was
[1:05:02] the fourth the word what the word there
[1:05:05] was four great prophets to bring the
[1:05:08] word back right
[1:05:13] amen did you read that part
[1:05:18] though Luther Wesley Pentecost with the
[1:05:23] restoration of the gifts that's all
[1:05:25] that's all people think that isusa
[1:05:26] street Pentecost was was restoration of
[1:05:28] gifts no it was the fullness of the
[1:05:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:05:33] right but yet in this message people
[1:05:35] teach that that that was not even a true
[1:05:38] thing onus Street why
[1:05:40] not you know why not because they're
[1:05:42] Pentecostal them themselves and they're
[1:05:44] lost go ahead and do what you want
[1:05:46] to cuz here's where he said it
[1:05:48] restoration of the Bride
[1:05:49] tree he says Pentecost what was the
[1:05:53] third Pentecost with the restoration of
[1:05:55] the G gifts the Holy Ghost baptism of
[1:05:57] the Holy Ghost what was the fourth the
[1:05:59] word what the
[1:06:01] word that's right what is he say on
[1:06:04] questions and answers on the seal 63 324
[1:06:08] paragraph 52 in each one of those ages
[1:06:11] only taken a dip into the Holy Spirit
[1:06:12] justification is a work of the Holy
[1:06:14] Spirit sanctification is a work of the
[1:06:16] Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy
[1:06:18] spirit that's the reason it took a
[1:06:20] prophetic Prophet to come down
[1:06:23] listen that sounds like you're talking
[1:06:25] about him no uh-uh come on said no
[1:06:27] Messenger to the age cuz the Holy Ghost
[1:06:29] came himself in his fullness of the
[1:06:32] baptism so isusa Street had the fullness
[1:06:35] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[1:06:37] fell on the day of
[1:06:38] Pentecost not the upper room experience
[1:06:41] the outside of the
[1:06:42] 3000 we've been through all of that but
[1:06:45] what but at the end of the age that it
[1:06:47] always ends upon the other we find there
[1:06:49] then the messenger sent and all the
[1:06:51] Scruples and things would be making it
[1:06:53] ready for the Rapture look at this an
[1:06:54] off of Master peie if you listening to
[1:06:56] it paragraph 13 uh
[1:07:00] 6 justification made a way for
[1:07:02] sanctification sanctification made a way
[1:07:04] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:07:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for
[1:07:08] the Holy Ghost itself to come right into
[1:07:11] Perfection back to the word again to the
[1:07:14] Masterpiece
[1:07:17] itself but see Luther had the baptism of
[1:07:20] the Holy Ghost of his
[1:07:22] day which was a just shall live by faith
[1:07:26] he wasn't required the other
[1:07:28] things Wesley come along you know Wesley
[1:07:31] believed Luther's message he was a
[1:07:33] missionary from Luther's message of the
[1:07:35] just shall live by faith Coming to
[1:07:37] America to convert the
[1:07:40] Heathen and you got over here in the
[1:07:42] moravians or every how you pronounce
[1:07:44] them they taught him the message of
[1:07:46] sanctification and he goes back home
[1:07:49] saying lo I went to America to convert
[1:07:51] the Heathen found out I was a heathen
[1:07:53] right why God opened the word and
[1:07:56] brought
[1:08:00] sanctification bringing sanctification
[1:08:03] the new birth of that age but then ausa
[1:08:06] Street 1906 Pentecost was the baptism of
[1:08:09] the Holy Ghost back like it was in the
[1:08:12] book of
[1:08:13] Acts your Prophet said I met people that
[1:08:15] had the Holy Ghost 50 years before I did
[1:08:18] but yet there's a lot of people believe
[1:08:20] that well them that Holy Ghost you got
[1:08:22] ain't nothing just an anointing there is
[1:08:24] people that are anointing right but he
[1:08:26] calls it the genuine Holy Spirit he
[1:08:29] calls it the fullness of the Holy Spirit
[1:08:31] to come on the zeusa street but where
[1:08:33] are we
[1:08:36] at no we just take what we want to
[1:08:39] believe that's what they' done at NAA
[1:08:42] they took what they wanted to believe
[1:08:43] and denominated and went in the ground
[1:08:45] so you and I are going to the grave
[1:08:46] again if we don't believe the truth
[1:08:49] that's why I told you 40 years ago in
[1:08:51] this s
[1:08:52] right that most of the people in this
[1:08:54] end time that believe the message was
[1:08:56] going to die and go by the grave that's
[1:08:59] right why do you think we've been here
[1:09:01] 40 years come on since the prophet was
[1:09:03] here to let a lot of us die and go by
[1:09:05] the grave amen but there's a lot of
[1:09:07] young people dying and going by the
[1:09:09] grave in this message too why cuz if I'm
[1:09:13] not able to come to the place of where
[1:09:15] that the word can be made flesh in you
[1:09:16] and I if we're not able to we're going
[1:09:18] by the grave amen that's
[1:09:22] right I don't have to back up cuz I'm
[1:09:25] the guy that stood here in 74 and told
[1:09:27] you we could pass the year
[1:09:29] 226 and not break the prophet's message
[1:09:32] but people don't like that they like
[1:09:35] ain't nobody believe we going to be
[1:09:38] around here in

[1:14:36] preaching the
[1:14:38] message and said the
[1:14:42] vision come to reality come on you
[1:14:45] remember what the vision he's talking
[1:14:48] about he's talking about when he saw the
[1:14:52] bride
[1:14:55] and he said she came into view is
[1:14:57] perfect he said that was the early
[1:15:00] church perfect Masterpiece he
[1:15:04] said but he said then he saw the church
[1:15:08] come into view which was a bunch of
[1:15:10] naked women yeah claiming to be a
[1:15:13] church right a church a lot of
[1:15:16] difference in church and a bride yeah
[1:15:21] amen but see he was all upset and down
[1:15:24] and out would

[1:15:29] but the bride will come into VI
[1:15:32] again he said I taught it in the
[1:15:37] message he went through Masterpiece he
[1:15:40] said I taught it in the message he said

[1:15:46] into view again is going to be a
[1:15:47] masterpiece
[1:15:50] family she comes into you again he said
[1:15:52] just exactly like the original yes he
[1:15:55] said the only problem was a few at the
[1:15:57] end was getting out of step and said I
[1:16:00] was hollering at
[1:16:02] them
[1:16:04] well a masterpiece family you know why
[1:16:07] it's a masterpiece
[1:16:09] family cuz did you hear this
[1:16:14] one let's see if I can find
[1:16:21] it did you hear this one in the
[1:16:23] masterpiece
[1:16:27] the first Eve that failed that was used
[1:16:29] in the second Reformation second coming
[1:16:32] as bringing forth a child now has become
[1:16:34] the true bride again the seed right back
[1:16:36] with the original word again the alpha
[1:16:39] is and Omega is the same he said I'm
[1:16:41] Alpha and Omega the first message and
[1:16:43] the second message is the same I'm Alpha
[1:16:45] and Omega did you hear this one let's
[1:16:47] see I'll find it here in a
[1:16:49] minute he said because she's of the
[1:16:53] same source
[1:16:57] she's the same
[1:17:02] creation you remember in the church age
[1:17:04] book where he said the bride was of the
[1:17:07] same
[1:17:08] Source believe it's
[1:17:11] 151 a masterpiece
[1:17:14] family the story of
[1:17:17] redemption going from what started to
[1:17:20] where you and I are at amen now I'll
[1:17:22] finish it with the F last one what
[1:17:26] the Bible says they without us can not
[1:17:30] be made
[1:17:31] perfect so all of those behind are
[1:17:34] depending on you and
[1:17:36] I that's right but just
[1:17:39] remember the stalk of corn get out there
[1:17:42] and look at it it don't turn brown until
[1:17:46] now you pull the corn off of it take it
[1:17:48] in the house and cook it right that's
[1:17:51] when it's ready to good to eat you know
[1:17:53] but when you let it dry on the stalk the
[1:17:56] stalk stays
[1:17:58] green until the full corn ready where
[1:18:03] that if it could it could be
[1:18:06] planted cuz see they don't do it now
[1:18:08] like we used to we used to leave it out
[1:18:10] there in the
[1:18:14] field until it totally
[1:18:17] dried it wasn't green we didn't gather
[1:18:20] it green cuz you gather it green throw
[1:18:21] it in the barn what are you going to get
[1:18:24] come on we had in the barn of corn you
[1:18:27] throw it in our green where you going to
[1:18:28] get a rotten stinking
[1:18:32] mess we put it in there it was capable
[1:18:34] right then to shut it off or sheld it
[1:18:36] off put it in the
[1:18:38] ground why CU it was back to original
[1:18:41] right you said but I just don't see it
[1:18:43] brother Dale I just don't see nobody
[1:18:45] with it who's got
[1:18:47] it I didn't write the
[1:18:51] book I didn't write the Bible come on
[1:18:55] and I don't make excuses come on but I
[1:18:57] tell the truth come
[1:19:00] on Jesus couldn't do Mighty miracles in
[1:19:03] a city why because of their unbelief
[1:19:07] Jesus Christ can't work today because of
[1:19:09] the
[1:19:10] unbelief that's right right that's right
[1:19:13] what unbelief when you say I don't see
[1:19:15] it that's unbelief I don't give a hoop
[1:19:18] where I can see it or not it's whether
[1:19:20] or not he said it amen he called me
[1:19:23] bride what what right have I got to do
[1:19:25] anything else the Bible calls me his
[1:19:27] wife what right have I got to do of
[1:19:29] saying anything other than what he says
[1:19:31] amen
[1:19:34] right he says I'm perfect what do you
[1:19:37] say well I don't see it well that's all
[1:19:39] right I don't see it in you either there
[1:19:42] no problem but I'm taking what he
[1:19:45] said it's not when you and I get to
[1:19:47] where we see it I thought we was what
[1:19:50] supposed to believe
[1:19:52] it that's right before we could ever see
[1:19:58] it we say seeing's believing no no no no
[1:20:02] believing got to come for seeing in the
[1:20:04] Bible you got to believe it if the Same
[1:20:08] Spirit that's right now of saying now
[1:20:10] listen we listening last night and heard
[1:20:12] him say the same Spirit or not before
[1:20:15] last I guess the Same Spirit today
[1:20:18] that's saying I don't see it I don't see
[1:20:21] the manifestations of God I don't see
[1:20:23] the things that would ought to be
[1:20:26] he said put you back there where Jesus
[1:20:28] was at he said you would have the same
[1:20:31] belief
[1:20:33] there right
[1:20:37] right whatever we're standing today is
[1:20:40] exactly where we've been standing in
[1:20:42] front of the Lord Jesus well I just
[1:20:44] don't think you're
[1:20:47] him now brother D I wouldn't do that you
[1:20:51] liar why because you're not believing it
[1:20:53] now right if we believe it now it means
[1:20:57] the spirit in US was back there to
[1:20:58] believe
[1:21:02] him but a masterpiece family
[1:21:06] yes that God said was going to come to
[1:21:13] pass and you never put it on
[1:21:18] conditions well and I firm believer too
[1:21:22] if we live like the devil we are the
[1:21:24] devil
[1:21:25] that's no problem you see me living like
[1:21:28] the devil you just walk up and say hey
[1:21:29] devil how you
[1:21:32] doing
[1:21:37] right but seeing the best we can do in
[1:21:39] stumbling and Fallen God looks down and
[1:21:42] don't see that cuz he can't see us he
[1:21:45] sees our
[1:21:49] sacrifice was that give me an excuse to
[1:21:51] go on doing wrong you
[1:21:53] hypocrite that's the best words I can
[1:21:55] say for you hypocrite to think you can
[1:21:57] get by who's wanting to get
[1:22:01] by had a dream last night most horrible
[1:22:05] thing I woke up I got up I said God is
[1:22:07] that
[1:22:10] me are you trying to tell me that's
[1:22:16] me if it is get rid of
[1:22:23] it you
[1:22:25] see cuz I want to be what he wants me to
[1:22:28] be I want to be like Mary you remember
[1:22:32] be it unto me according to Thy
[1:22:34] word wasn't that what Mary
[1:22:37] said come on musicians let's
[1:22:40] stand a perfect
[1:22:43] Masterpiece a perfect Plan of Salvation
[1:22:45] that God has revealed to you and I Amen
[1:22:48] to make
[1:22:49] known all things to you and I is't that
[1:22:53] wonderful
[1:22:55] amen isn't it wonderful to live in a day
[1:22:58] that we can understand it yes sir that's
[1:23:00] right that the Mysteries has been
[1:23:02] revealed but are we afraid of the
[1:23:04] Mysteries as I said a while ago are we
[1:23:06] afraid well let's don't step out on them
[1:23:08] now step out on what if the prophet
[1:23:10] preached it is simple come
[1:23:13] on that's right now what he didn't
[1:23:15] preach ain't no need of me trying to
[1:23:19] touch right they don't even talking
[1:23:23] about so things right because the
[1:23:27] prophet didn't preach
[1:23:29] it well because remember and I think now
[1:23:34] that's in Masterpiece I'm not
[1:23:37] certain Harvest Masterpiece he not a to
[1:23:40] shook he says or I was looking at
[1:23:42] yesterday he says nobody's got a right
[1:23:45] to say thus sayith the
[1:23:48] Lord except the
[1:23:51] prophet that's what he said he said
[1:23:54] nobody's has got a right to say thus
[1:23:55] sayth the Lord except a
[1:24:01] prophet I no problem with
[1:24:05] that because my dependence is upon
[1:24:08] whether or not he was God's
[1:24:12] prophet and then I don't have to worry
[1:24:14] about it see then we do then have thus
[1:24:16] sayth the Lord because he said if the
[1:24:18] bride don't have thus sayith the Lord
[1:24:19] she's going to stand
[1:24:21] still well now there's a lot of
[1:24:23] difference in having thus sayth the Lord
[1:24:25] and what he said he said nobody's got a
[1:24:28] right to
[1:24:29] speak and say thus sayith the Lord
[1:24:32] except a prophet but I can say what he
[1:24:35] says I
[1:24:37] am and be
