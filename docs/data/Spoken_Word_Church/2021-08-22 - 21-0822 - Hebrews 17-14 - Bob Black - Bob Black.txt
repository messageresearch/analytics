TRANSCRIPT
========================================
eat it and we'll just go into the a little a little sunday school lesson for for the next 30 minutes before the song service and uh as you as you know we've been going through if the builders could pull up their little powerpoint slide uh the book of hebrews and i think we've made it to about verse seven and uh and and hebrews is really trying to uh that paul trying to really set the stage of trying to set within the people's minds that the of who they believed and that this is this this this man jesus christ that's come on the scene and and and began to speak the the message that we have heard that they heard back then in the early church is more than just a man uh as the the apostles and the prophets or the the the people spoke down to the ages they kind of gave a little reflection a little bit of the light but now this man came on the scene and they could see clearly um who it was that that that we believe so let's just kind of review um hebrews 1 1-6 it says god who has sundry times and in diverse manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophet so at many times many different ways somebody was actually speaking through to them through the to the fathers by the prophets and it was this it was this one jesus christ who had now and verse two hath in these last days spoken unto us by a son now was actually had ministered to them in the flesh and they were able to to hear him and and sit on the shores of galilee and listen to him speaking to them and and as thomas did put his fingers in his side and they could actually hug this man and and and talk to him and listen to him hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed the heir of all things and we know appointed because he had an appointment to actually come and die for us on the cross and to fulfill the word of god that he was appointed to do and he was appointed heir of all things in other words he was appointed he he being god himself he was heir of everything by whom also he made the worlds so this man that walked on the shores of galilee is actually the one that spoke the worlds into existence that spoke everything into existence who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person in other words like jesus said if you if you've seen me you've seen the father if you've seen me you know everything there is to know about the father you you i i am the brightness of his glory and the express the express image of who the father is and upholding all things by the world all things by the world of his power when he had by himself purged our sins set down on the right hand of the majesty on high and and that that verse rather sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high that's got a lot of things kind of packed into that that maybe we'll get to time permitting sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high there's so many every it's like everything that paul says is just so packed full of richness richness and so that's what we want to do as we go through this the the book of hebrews is just kind of unpack some of these things that paul is talking about being made so much better than the angels in other words being made so much better than the ones that were speaking down to the old testament the ones that you know so much better than than gabriel that the little bit of light that they could shed as they were going as they were speaking down to the old testament gabriel would come to daniel and shed a little bit of light and and uh and and david and all the prophets would speak and a little bit of light but now here was the one that was that they were speaking of made manifest before them as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they and the name that he inherited that the name was jesus christ that he came he came in the name of the father for unto which of the angels said he at any time thou art my son of this day have i begotten thee this day have i have have i birthed you and again i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son which to which of them had did he to the angels to the prophets which of them did he say that and again when he bringeth in the first begotten in the world he saith and let all the angels of god worship him so let's go to the next slide in hebrews 1-7 it begins to talk about angels so we'll just kind of sit on this a little bit and and start to unpack that talking about the angels what did brother what did brother paul really mean when he was beginning to talk about the angels and how this man was more excellent than the angels he said of the angels he saith who make his angels spirits i want you to notice how much is packed into their scripture spirits his angels now now we know i got these little cards highlighted here let me not step away too far from the mic angels the definition in the in the greek of an angel is a messenger so angels are messengers and a minister a minister is somebody that ministers to people and of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits so the angels there's something spiritual going on something supernatural and his ministers a flame of fire a minister a flame of fire so much so much goodness here to unpack so let's go through it and see what um the prophet that we believe that came in this last day had to say about these things now go to the next slide and in hebrews 1 7 and brother branham said in the message and that he preached in 1951 in the ain't called the angel of the lord he said the whole book of revelation was showed john by an angel i jesus has sent my angel to testify he's quoting scripture is that right so angels are ministering spirits you usually come in the form of lights and i truly personally as i started to say a while ago with my bible over my heart i believe that the angel of god i've seen it since i was a little boy and that little cabin they told me he come in that you see in the picture that the lady drawed last night of a little cabin where i was born that that doesn't make me even equal with the church or the people that's right in other words he was saying i'm not sharing this to make myself a big person or somebody that you would highly regard in that way he said it isn't the idea today who's great and who's not great the idea of it today is to get people to believe the lord jesus so in other words we believe we believe in the supernatural there's a supernatural element there's a supernatural unseen world that that we can't see with our natural eyes and in that world are these supernatural beings angels that are moving around that sometimes you know people will get a glimpse of something supernatural with a light and you've heard people testify in some church meetings where they'll look over and they'll see an angel standing there as the preaching of the gospel is going on so i really want to stress to you that it's not a strange thing for us to believe a prophet that saw an angel because paul said the very first church age messenger that he's that an angel came and told him to not to fear with the ship was wrecked when he was on his journey and an angel actually came an angel came and loosed him out of the jail so we believe in a supernatural element we we're we're it's not far-fetched to believe that there are angels there are angels the bible says that angels will visit you unaware and they might look like just a normal human being one of my favorite stories is where brother branham was he was going into his home and he said there was a man with a little flat nose outside and he and he told him uh you know he gave him a little a little warning about you know watch out for such and such i don't remember the specifics and all of a sudden he disappeared and it was a uh you know you take that it was something supernatural happened it was a supernatural visitation so we believe we believe in angels but now to get really get the sense of what paul's talking about here he's kind of he's kind of bringing the supernatural down to where you can actually you're actually sitting in a church service and you're actually listening to a messenger you're actually listening to somebody bring you the word and so he's actually bringing you he's actually trying to to bring to your knowledge and understanding that the angels that you might be thinking of might not be the angels that he's talking about and he said so let's go to the next slide and of the angels we're talking about this this scripture uh hebrews 1 7 of the angels he saith who makes his angels spirits and his minister is a flame of fire now brother brown said in the message faith in 1956 he said now what happened just now so he's talking about again another world it's an unseen world there's an unseen world beyond the veil of our flesh that we can't perceive by our natural eye we become so conscious of looking at one another like this but there's an unseen world and you it's greater than anything you can see now think about that that even as you're sitting here you know waiting we're about to enter into the song service i'm about to hear the preaching of the word that there's actually an unseen world that angels could be walking even even your loved ones could be appearing over the banister of heaven listening to the word that you're hearing right now and all of these things cannot be perceived by your natural eye but yet it's there because there's an unseen world that you can't perceive he said there's an unseen world and it's greater than anything you can see in this world in this building here are evil spirits and war and christians anointed and the angels of god encamped about them trying to energize them with faith now isn't that just a powerful scripture to think to think that the angels of god are encamped around about you and they want you to believe they're here trying to help you now let's keep going on let's go to the next slide and and brother brown said in the greatest battle ever fought he said now here the bible comes right back and tells us here that god sends forth angels what are they ministering spirits the glory now see now now the kind of picture he's bringing it down to earthly where you're sitting at a in a service and you're hearing a messenger preach you the word that's been anointed by a spirit from another world that's been anointed by the holy spirit to bring you a message that will help you out of the predicament that you're in that sends forth angels glory what are they ministering spirits glory ministering spirit sent from the presence of god what what to do minister his word they're not to minister some theology of some denominational group but to minister his word that's it ministering spirit set forth how do we know they are the bible said that the word of the lord came to the prophets is that right these angels minister his word through his spirit minister the word through the holy spirit and the spirit and the word came to the prophets and the prophets had the word of god so now we're bringing it down to the earthly where you can actually sit in church and listen to an angel bring you the word an angel that's anointed by something from another world by something supernatural to give an action so that they can speak the word to help you now let's go to the next slide he said in hebrews now this is where we really nail it down where brother brown was preaching the series on hebrews and we got to chapter 2 he began to really nail down what these angels are that paul was talking about and he said what do we find the angels to be prophets god spoke in sundry time now you have to make not our own idea our own idea might be that we need to hear we need to we need to put all our confidence only in seeing a light or having some supernatural thing come but our confidence is on the word of god not a feeling or a sensation or something that we've that we've you know maybe some supernatural a dream that we had or something like dreams are nice and their dreams are wonderful and we need dreams but so many times you can't put confidence on a dream but you can put confidence on the word of god what do we find the angels to be prophets now you have to make not your own idea our own idea but the bible now the first chapter the first verse god who at sundry times in diver's manner spake to the fathers by the prophets now he goes over here and say again for the words spoken by angels were steadfast and what does an angel mean a messenger if god anointed messenger and then if we be anointed if we be anointed by the supernatural element by the holy spirit we are gods and messengers all right now let's tie it all together let's go to the next slide so let's tie some of these scriptures together it says in hebrews 1 7 and of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers of flame of fire and now in the the last of of this first chapter and in verses 13 14 it says but to which of the angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool are they not all ministering spirits and sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation so so again now he's ministering spirits he's talking about ministers behind the pulpit and then he says hebrews chapter two verse five to six now now this is what brother brown is really talking about he says it says for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come wherever we speak but one in a certain place testified one in a certain place testified now who's he quoting he's quoting david now he's saying an angel said and then he quotes david so if it was an angel like a supernatural angel with wings or light or whatever some kind of supernatural thing then he would not be able to quote a man that actually spoke these words the man david said what is man that thou art mindfully of him or the son of man that thou visitest him so then we kind of can clinch that in the ground that the angels that paul are speaking of are now these men that have been anointed by something supernatural now now you can actually go back and listen to hebrews chapter 2 and and the message that brother branham priest where he really clinches that into the ground that we're talking about now men that can actually minister to you so and let's go to the next slide he said see in your body inside of you we got another question on that directly that that'll answer it better so when inside of you is a spirit another man the outside of you is one man the inside of you is another man so the inside of you is the supernatural the outside of you is the physical and this being if you are spirit led by god you became a messenger of god or an angel god's messenger god's angel is the very same word can't separate it god's messenger or god's angel and which has the greatest authority now this is this really clinches it which has the greatest authority an angel from heaven or an angel at the pulpit which has which has it the angel at the pulpit paul said if an angel from heaven comes and preaches any other gospel to you than this which i've already preached let him be accursed so the angel anointed with the holy spirit and with the word stands next to god in the heaven his authority now that's for something that's that's a really weighted quote to read that an angel in the pulpit in other words somebody that's got the holy ghost on the inside and knows the correct interpretation of the word and actually god is building up their faith here that they can actually stand in this element of time in flesh and speak the word out and deliver some money from their predicament actually is in a higher place than an angel and they have greater authority than it why because they're actually tied in by the new birth with god with eternal life and they're speaking from a place like that the scripture says a minister should speak as of the oracles of god because they're speaking as though they're reflecting the light from within that holy place they're speaking they're reflecting out the light of the holy of holies so that you can get a glimpse of the eternal things that god wants you to see now let's go to the next slide he said the greatest battle ever fall now if you go back and listen to the greatest battle ever fault brother brown really nails down how the benefit of ministers to the church and see that's exactly what paul is laying down here in the in in this church in in this chapter that ministers and the greatest battle ever fought what does brother ryan say that ministers will give you something to get you out of the eggshell they'll get you they'll give you a gift they'll give they'll arm you with the word to give get you out of depression and out of sin and out of that life of iniquity and things and brother abraham says in this message he said these are ministering spirits sent from the presence of god to be ministers to minister what his word not some theology but god's word they are ministering spirits sent forth from god to minister and remember if it ministers something besides the word it didn't come from god because thy word is always confirmed in heaven always in heaven the word god watches over it and he'll never send a spirit to minister something besides the word now let's go to the next slide and he said now now he begins to talk about micah and micah is one of those stories in the bible if you just kind of reset set your remembrance those three kings went to go fight a battle and they had 400 prophets and jehoshaphat said well let's let's we wanted to find a real prophet so they went out searching for a real prophet micah came on the scene and brother brown uses him as an example of what a ministering spirit was because he didn't listen to all the stuff that the 400 prophet said he was going to stay straight with god's word why because he was anointed he was anointed with a supernatural spirit something that allowed him to see into another into that other realm and he had a supernatural understanding of what was actually going to take place so that made him a ministering spirit that he was able to deliver a message that was beyond anything that you could understand with the flesh and was far beyond anything that those 400 prophets those 400 lying unbelieving prophets were able to to bring now so brother brahma said in the message the greatest battle ever fought he said why his flues had been cleaned down and what are your flues your memory reason consciousness affects your imagination in other words he was discarding all of that stuff and just taking god's word he didn't care what he remembered or imagined or or thought up he was just going to take god's word and that was it he said his mind had opened up to the word of god and the word of god only would he believe that's a ministering spirit that's a ministering spirit that's what a ministering spirit is he said i don't know what to say now but i'll tell you this one thing i'll only say what god tells me to say now let's go to the next slide and brother brahm said how do we know they are the bible said the word of the lord came to the prophets these angels minister his word through his spirit talking about angels these angels minister his word through the holy spirit and the spirit and the word came to the prophets and the prophets had the word of god that's the reason they could do the miracles that they did it wasn't the man it was the spirit of god in the man the spirit of christ and the man for the word of god what had he done cleaned out every channel god had chose him and he was anointed with the holy ghost and that's the spirit the ministering spirit it's the holy ghost in the man to minister and to speak out to you and to help you get out of your predicament now now so you you you gotta like blend these supernatural the supernatural element and the earthly element where god can actually get in the earth let's go to the next slide and speak out through somebody and help you now so this is i've got a little picture of a of of the three men three men that came to abraham and so let's read what brother brown said about that so we got there we got a supernatural type typing something that actually happened in the flesh in this day now because brother brown said he said there was three angels came to abraham the church elected two of them went down in sodom and brought out lot and his wife and daughters she turned around sodomites burned so there's three supernatural men that came and spoke and we know who those men are but now in this day let's bring it down there were actually angels fleshly men that were speaking out to deliver a message and he and brother brown compares two of them he said two of them a modern billy graham and an oral robbers in this day his messages went down into sodom preaching the word blinding them with the word to disbelieve the word you are blind the preaching of the gospel blinds the unbeliever and that's what billy graham and those evangelists are doing blinding so i'm really nailing down this morning that the angels these ministers the oral roberts and billy graham were earthly ministers that were anointed to preach a message to deliver a message because that's what an angel is as a messenger and they've got a message and so they had a message but now there was a third one now the lord himself that actually came down and he had a message so maybe just just meditate on that for a little bit let's go to the next slide and and uh we'll be done in just a few more minutes and can go on into the song service and it says in hebrews chapter two brother i'm preaching again he said for the four if the word spoke by angels what do we find the angels to be prophets now now let's go go to the next slide i'm i'm running through some of these kind of quickly but i i i think i think you get the idea and brother brown said in discernment of spirit now now this is what confuses people when you get into what a new testament prophet is brother braham said a new testament prophet is a preacher a preacher we said we all know that just any minister that's a preacher is a prophet a new testament prophet if he's prophesying preaching not try to to try to edify himself to make a big name or to edify his organization and go down to the next the next verse he said now if we'll notice the motives and objectives of the old testament prophets them men had one objective and that was jesus christ they had one thing that their whole theme of the old testament was built around the coming messiah in other words their whole objective was jesus christ it was not to build up a big following not to amass a great big pile of money not not any of the things you know uh popularity anything like that their whole motive was jesus christ so let's let's examine that word prophet and and maybe we'll take that into some of this into the next week as well but the word prophet in the greek lexicon in greek writings an interpreter of oracles or of hidden things in other words they're speaking by supernatural anointing to interpret actually and to speak what the word says one who moved by the spirit of god and hence his organ or spokesman solemnly declares a spirit of god and hence his organ or spokesman solemnly declares the men what he has received by inspiration so a new testament prophet preacher is going to be speaking by inspiration and it will we'll get into the difference between what a new testament prophet is and what a prophet is in the five full ministry and what a prophet is that would be over the seven church ages the kind of prophet was that that all these different kind of things because i i think sometimes it kind of confuses people when you talk about a new testament prophet preacher you begin to wonder well are you saying that they've got the same kind of gift of discernment and all these kind of things that that that like brother branham did it it's it's kind of putting different labels on on things so that you can be the new testament prophet is someone that speaks under the inspiration of the holy spirit to preach the word under inspiration like like brother brown was saying in in the greatest battle ever fault to get you out of your predicament to help you to loose you from your sins to get to build up your faith to a place where you know that god has done something for you that he cares about you to to bring up in your mind the question of whether or not you care or not and why that's important and he said so in 2e down there at the bottom he said a men filled with the spirit of god and the musicians can start going coming forward and we'll start transitioning to the next part of the service of men filled with the spirit of god who by god's authority and command and words of weight pleads the cause of god and urges salvation of men and that's a new testament prophet and that's why we're talking about in in in hebrews chapter 1 verse 7 and of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire and maybe just take that and meditate on it through the through the week and uh and god bless you thanks
