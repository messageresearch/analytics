TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you can't get this thing to work Ryan that's why you couldn't hear there's no audience the audio comes from theirs all right so let's go to Second Peter one and we we're through this study of the Statue of a perfect man which is over here on the board then that the prophet grew for us and put this thing together I was uh reading some quotes this morning that where brother Brown said that um that in I'm not gonna pull that door shut there's nobody in there they're not yeah Lord's not here I don't know if he's coming or not apparently yeah Paul went in his mama's class okay second Peter 1 3. of course that's his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness so what we're talking about is we're talking about life and had to be Godly in this life all right through the knowledge of him they have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these what these promises that God's made us you might be partakers of the divine nature now remember let me just kind of background a minute we were born with not a divine nature right our nature was the children of Wrath as you see David here he's crying out to God for the things that he done the sins that he done and the iniquity in his life and all the things that's going on David has a struggle because David can't get the new birth so he's got that war going on that we have but our war is in the spirit Realm all right because remember this body only does what motivates inside that's right and and not saying anything against any you know we got our new brothers and sister back here but smoking smoking doesn't come from the spirit it's motivated by the thing that's in there same way with you and I I used to chew tobacco every day just like doing just like smoking for 20 years Danny knows that we went fishing together many times but you know one day when God saved my soul it stopped that day I went from Tuesday night all right Jim I was dipping on tears tonight yeah Wednesday I came to church gave my heart to God I never put another drop in my mouth because God took that desire away because your body craves that right hey people I'm telling you it's hard it's a hard devil to get rid of okay but your body craves that thing I see them your body craves that thing well when your body craves that thing you've got to have something to change because look the divine nature of God doesn't smoke the divine nature of God does is Curse the divine nature of God doesn't to you and you can name all these different things but it comes back to the it comes back to having gone in your soul right not just something that makes you feel good right we're not talking about a feel-good gospel here we're talking about living and that's what this is life and godliness so we're looking at life that we're living and godliness it's a process you go through justification where God forgives you of you past sins right those are done whatever you did in your pastor done if you ask God to forgive you he's just the Bible says he's just to forgive you so whatever you've done in the past it's done right even if you were a prostitute right doesn't matter if you're Justified and you're in God's eyes you're just as virgin as the next person but now there's certain things you can't do and you can't deny it yourself that's why you have a war in your spirit because your memory remembers it right your reasoning says you did it that's right you're conscious absolutely bothers you you're affectionate and Imagination and all those things are still there so there's the war of the fight but down in that Soul if you've been truly Justified God's putting you toward a place that he can sanctify you all right and then under sanctification that's where you get the unclean Spirit out the Bible says there in Matthew that that he gets he he's the unclean Spirit goes out of a man walks in dry places seek his breath finds none comes back makes you worse if you don't get the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the most important thing that's the divine nature of God you were born with your parents nature and the nature of the devil everybody was that's right there's only one person that wasn't that's Jesus Christ amen so everybody everybody's on the same level we're no one big up here in a little down here and just this and just no we all start at the same level we're lost that's right and until God brings us to our knowledge of being lost we're lost that's right and we're going you know what you do the nature of lost people that's right it's like Dave Ramsey said he said if you do rich people things you'll become rich if you do poor people things you're gonna stay poor and that's just the truth in natural life but the same way in spiritual life I can't help this this is the way I was born yeah there's certain things you can't help but the Holy Ghost gives you a divine nature and that's what we're talking about here with these verses it's a divine nature that comes into you this is not just playing church and coming to church and feeling good now it's going out there and living it before others right that's the walk okay I was just gonna say that you said that when you came before that Wednesday night it was gone I felt it going I mean I knew it was gone I just want for their benefit my dad you know my dad sure um loved it true question but he went for years he went for a long time with the smoking tree and when the prophet he said he could not remember how many cartons of cigarettes he threw away you know but then when he was called out he said on the way home he threw that pack out the window he never had the desire again but I mean sometimes it takes a while sure it takes a while I'm just telling you that that even uh sister Paul Bush uh Donny's Mama where's Susan yeah Donny's mom that's the first time I hadn't seen you in the crowd I just haven't heard but but sister um Sister Hazel she smoked for a while and that's okay but we gotta remember this is a process same way with being born again this is the process once you get the divine nature see says having escaped the corruption that is in the world through us now we all believe the Bible right the bibles are absolute in this church the Bible is the absolute so we take the absolute that if we get the divine nature of God it automatically pushes those things out see I had a desire when I was dipping and doing those things and I told you I used to cuss like a sailor remember I told you that I knew I was delivered because God one day I was talking on the phone and I was getting ready to to say the bad word that used to come out so freely and it was like somebody hit me in the chest it was God that hit me in the chair yes right yeah all right I mean because I said those words freely because I didn't have a divine nature okay I had my own nature I had a nature that I was born with which is contrary to God and we all were born I said everybody but Jesus Christ so everybody's on the same level doesn't matter if it's Prophet priest or King we were all born lost and needed to have this new nature put in us right then once we get that new nature put in US we've still got a divine nature to live by that's right that's what we're talking about now so this is this is not just this is not just going to church and living right I got some quotes maybe we'll get to them or not but brother Brown said it's not how much you shout it's not how much you speak in tongues it's not how much you know the Bible he said it's how much you can live the nine spiritual gifts out there in the world which is love joy peace long-suffering meekness kindness patience right things like that all right and you project that because the uh people that were in the Old Testament they were called Christians because the word Christian means christ-like in other words the people that saw Christ walking on the earth they saw Peter James and John walking on the earth just like Christ did so they called them Christians all right so that's the way you and I have to be we have to be Christian to be identified with Christ but if you have the divine nature of God God wants to still give you more gifts he wants to still give you more promises seed exceeding great and precious promises not just little ones exceeding he wants to abound and besides this giving all diligence in other words let's just don't make this an everyday thing besides just giving all Dylan it will just add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge and all its Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness now we're on patience now this is not just patience uh as in the world if you know it's like um I would say that you know well let's say for example brother Tatum brother Tatum was the most patient person in the world those of you that knew him he was so patient but now he said this come out of his mouth before he got born again he was a rascal he only went to that church to see sister Tatum he didn't go to that church to see God he just went to the church to go see sister Tam all right it's hard to believe it same way Jim just went to church with me she'd come to church with me when we first met she was just a center out in the world of course I was too but I was trying to come to church and she'd come Church me just because I was at church now if you come here to see somebody besides God you're in trouble sure we like to commune with each other but if I commune with sister Johnny's that's me and God communicate with him okay same way with any of us here it's God communicating with each other through individuals that's what we're trying to do here we're trying to build a stature not a statue a stature which is a growth development it never says statue what is a statue stand he's dead yeah but a stature is a growth development of Eula I remember when she was born she's a little basement but you know she was cute as a button then she's cuter now and she's growing but she's growing in stature right EULA that turn yeah I don't even pay attention to me okay but now let's talk about patience for a minute we talked about faith we've got to have faith we got to have faith in in God but we've got to see that it's not just having faith in God that God's out there somewhere that God's somewhere over here we've got to have faith in God it is in you that's right all right he's in the preacher that's going to preach today are that he's somewhere that's tangible okay you know Dad said first sermon I heard him preach when I came back on that Wednesday night uh as I was riding up here to church uh the devil of course he's always there he was there saying you're not good enough and I was trying to go well if I quit this and I quit that and I don't do this and I don't do that I'll get Daddy's sermon was you can't get good enough to be saved and you can you can't wash yourself up enough to get saved it's got to be an inward work you cannot no way physically make yourself say but now look if you get the divine nature of the one that wrote the Bible number one you'll start reading the Bible and quit reading all that other junk you'll start seeing what God said to you see as a young Christian we all have to do that we all gotta we all got to um I know as we get older in life we uh sometimes you know Dad can about quote the Bible so he really doesn't have to read every day but I'm I'm sure he it's like he and I are kind of geared the same way I you see people and I'm not putting off on them and the message they've always got their earbuds in and they're listening to a sermon constantly 24 hours a day I just don't do that but I meditate on what I already know what God Said and that's the way daddy is daddy be just working away and he'll just be meditating the tape's running in his head right it ain't running and you know it ain't it ain't physically hooked to him but it's running in his head because he's known it long enough he's been in this message for 50 years 45 years so it kind of turns over and God can put those things together but a lot of us are geared different we have to listen to tape see I can't listen to tape my mind goes and goes wandering I have to read yeah I'm a reader if I read I'd block everything out and I don't I can't I mean the world could fall apart and I if I'm reading a book it doesn't matter what's going on I can focus on that book but now turn on a tape I'll go to sleep or my mind will be over under somewhere but I'm just being honest with you but I'm telling you in your Christian experience you got to figure out what works for you even in all this and I'm not saying just for the young ones I'm saying for all of them like you were talking about patience last Sunday you got to figure out a way to get where you don't have bad thoughts about that guy that pulls out in front of you you know right but I want to read something in just a minute because it's and I'm sorry when I did it this morning I got up at five o'clock couldn't sleep so I did my sermon or I did my notes and I did them in smaller fonts so if some of you in the back is not gonna be able to read the ones that's coming up but um brother Ryan said patient in patience the Bible says possess you your soul but brother around says patience is something you've got to endure so you've got to go through all these troubles you got to go through it we all brojo yeah you were talking about that guy pulling in front of you yeah your inner man wants to do something but there's something an Insight even if you wanted to you can't do it you know what I mean that's correct that's correct you that's right brother Brown said if your gear something like if you're geared to the Holy Ghost see when that starts turning and it used to like my I used to say bad words that Cog in my head now listen let me be real honest with you those bad words hadn't went away that's right I still got them in my head that's right and I'll call myself something every once in a while then I'll have to repent of sorry it's just I can't just say just the human brain that's where brother Brown said but don't sit there and dwell on it yeah say God forgive me because remember if you're a child of God you better watch what that thing inside you is calling you that's right if you're a child of God remember right because you can grieve the Holy Ghost not do away with it not be lost but you can grieve it but you say God you know that what man you know I wouldn't say that I would before but not now but it's just it's why it's in this brain this is where Satan works right here God takes what David said right here not what was up here okay brother I used to think that as long as I didn't involve nobody else in what I was doing right that I was only hurting myself since I've been coming here I've been realizing God's getting in me yeah and now I'm hurting God yeah how can you talk about God hurting there you go that's correct that's correct a woman that loves you and yep you know so that's bottom I can't smoke around people I go to church with yeah the other day I caught myself walk across street marks down that day and I caught myself throwing a whole cigarette on the ground polar Graham a whole cigarette those and boy before me and him met he called me one time you come around the house I was working in the backyard up there in Dixie Drive and I didn't hear him pull up and I was working in the back on the deck he come around there and I turned around looking him look what he did nothing he never never said a word example of God is what we are right and when you're doing all of that stuff you're hurting the temple of God right I mean that's right it's known that all this stuff we do drink smoke dope whatever we do that's hurt in this temple of God so that's why we don't do it because we're supposed to be right by the way not not that it you know and that's what you do is commendable that's what I did I didn't ever smoke around well I didn't smoke but I never tried not to chill except that one time but I didn't drink or anything like that around there that was respect but then I got to realize like you when I got saved I was kidding me more than I was kidding anybody else I was kidding me I wasn't kidding God he's there all the time he knew it from the foundation of the world before I was born what I'd be doing right all right so here we are you know it's it's like Mom said it's the temple you walk around in but that Temple has got to show what's inside that's right right the temple that's just what we're talking about here with patience we need to have more patience we need to have more knowledge we need to have more Temperance not have that brother perhaps an ungodly temper but the first thing he said to do was was to have patience with who God have patience with God let's shift to that let's get to it let's see patients with what what kind of patience first thing is have patience with God now let me paraphrase this if you've got real genuine faith you'll have real genuine impatience because Faith works with patience When God says anything you believe it so when we started our Christian Journey how many of us had ups and downs oh everybody raise their hand grief even Jesus was tempted that's right he had his ups and downs days and he was God Almighty and human flesh remember he did he asked himself what in the world y'all talking about one wants to sit on my right hand one more so you got aggravated with them right because he had a human nature but it was the nature of almighty God and that's what projected out but watch but watch what happens with this nature when you have the divine nature of God religious people don't like you I said religious people I say Christian I said religious people don't like you religious people kill Jesus the the drunks they didn't kill Jesus that's right they loved him because he was Healing The Sick he was testing out Devils he was helping Humanity but who killed him because of who he was the religious people and religious people is somebody that just puts on it's like brother Brown said you take a you take a crow and he starts sticking peacock feathers in his in his body and he might kind of look like a peacock but he's not going to act like one he's gonna act like a crow all right that's why that um if you didn't know this that's why that that Noah sent a dove okay right and a crow that's right you know why the dove couldn't eat the dead bodies that was flowing because there's billions of people died after the flood that's right so he sent them out well the dove comes back that's right the crow stays out there he's just he's just he's probably lit on somebody's body eating them but the dove come back so no one knew that the floods what that the waters hadn't went down far enough but when that Dove came back with a green leaf in his mouth so you remember one thing for sure and you know they even in this new movie Noah they even say it he stayed in that art for a year he didn't stay in there 40 days and 49. it was over a year they stayed in New York right because they had to wait till the 40 days and 40 nights and all that to happen then they had to wait for the waters to go down so it took over a year for them to be in there so that dub the reason they were in there that long the high places it took time for that those leaves to grow and for that Dove to go get that leaf and come back when they knew that because remember it was the nature of that Dove not to eat dead stuff that's right so he knew when that Dove came back with that green leaf in his mouth that the water had went down so they opened the door and went out of the arch so that's the same way with you and I you can have a chrome nature that's what we were born with eating anything in the world that's right but when we got that Dove nature it can see all that dead stuff laying there but it's not going to eat it it's going to eat a green leaf because they can't digest it when you get the divine nature of God you can't digest the things of the world anymore and like I said it's a it's a process it's a process hey man I'm telling you I'd rather see somebody struggle I'd rather see somebody fight their way to heaven then to see somebody come in how many times have we seen it people come in and they say oh this is great and this is wonderful three months later you don't see them no more well they ain't getting nothing to start with all right but the wine that's up and down and fighting and struggling and pray for me and pray for me and pray for me they usually last 99 of the time they last because they didn't just come in and see it's real easy to get in the atmosphere that's right it's real easy to get in the atmosphere it's what I always say I always tell people when I preach today we may feel good about what's going on because it's Sunday we're round Believers we're in this we're in this Dome of of Godly love but Monday morning when your feet hit the floor the devil's feet hits there first and he's the first one sitting right here that's when what you get on Sunday it's either going to do you any good or not one of the two the question I have for you is when a man leaves the house he's supposed to leave his wife to the Lord and that the only way he really got any right trying to leave her at all correct I mean she's grown human being right right and that's what I'm trying to do right but in that instance what I'm thinking is I've got to trust the person or persons that's leading this boat to the low in order for me to trust bringing my wife and let her be that with me and we both know the same direction true this is this is that's my question some percent trust in people that's exactly correct well I got that feeling here so told me in testimony about getting a place to live and all that yesterday I drove my marks and he was out there and uh there's one thing about it when you try see like David when you read that I feel David's struggle man he's up and down and you know what ninety percent of the time his fight wasn't from his kingdom his Earthly people sure he had a son that was but his fight those enemies were with inside him that's right his enemies ain't was in here right his enemies was here and he was warring against his own self that's right but see God knew in his heart that he wanted to do right I mean he God knows the heart he you know sometimes we get emotions and we get to feeling good and we get you know but God knows our heart he knows if our if your desire is to have your wife here you know what that Divine promise I told you about in in there in the second Peter it'll happen everybody we had a brother here that couldn't pay his bills remember that brother Harris a long time ago couldn't pass bills he got down on his knees on to Ottoman and he said God I need x amount of money and I only got this much but I need extra money yeah 19 I think he had 19 and he needed but when he got up from praying that stack of money had built up right in front of him yes yes and he had enough to pay now he didn't make him Rich God didn't give him 100 bills this high he had enough to pay his bill amen that's right dollar supply your needs not you want that's right right a lot of us wants and knew this and wants and knew that but God says you need work and get that but I'm going to give you this you need to work if you want a new car but I'm going to give you enough money to sustain yourself right through life pay your bills get your things done and Hank's got a real good testimony and I I appreciate somebody like that I like somebody fresh it's kind of like a yeah kind of like a breath of fresh air you got it wrong right now I'm wrong but the Skin's growing over me let's say I'm quitting easing off the hurting so much you know hey you do the best you can like I said under justification God forgives you but you still the things I did when I was out in the world they still haunt me that's correct see that'll tell you that's a good point that'll tell you whether it's truly God leading you and you're a God child is that you don't go back because remember justification is you're going in this direction all right you're going in this direction we all were born going in this direction we do a 180 not a 360. I've heard some people say we can do it if you do 360 you come right back around where you were that's right you do a 180 and you go in the opposite direction hey the best thing I've done when I was growing when I was growing in God I knew the things that I was weak on so I tried my best to stay away from that right I knew that I was weak on certain things and I tried my best to stay away from it just just move away from it I said something maybe go I've not done a lot of a whole lot of bad things and I've always had gone in my mind I wouldn't cross no lines I didn't think I'd get back across my biggest problem with drugs so when I got myself together this year last time I made a point letting everyone up know if you come in my yard I will call the police then we're gonna fight good good I'm told you to drag you out of this yard and I get through you're right I meant that we'll see if they see that sincerity see I had I had um uh forgive us forgetting that we'll go do patients next Sunday but um but see I still had friends that did and Jim knows that I had I had cans of skull in around the house even that Wednesday night after I came home and told her I'd you know give my heart to the Lord and I tell you that what was tough was Hank is she and I went to church here for a long time together then we quit and then she started coming back and I didn't but when the Lord started dealing with me she quit here and started going to baptist church so see I had a quandary there I had I'm like Lord I'm finally coming back and here my wife's gone off again you know not again but she's gone off you know but it took her going to a Baptist Church to realize what that the realness that this is real and that's not I ain't saying nothing against the Baptist Church but that's where I grew up that was familiar that was correct that was her comfort zone They believe in here that was her comfort and I was making trying to you know you know trying to figure out what everybody was doing here and why everybody feels the way they feel and I started asking God to come be with me and help me understand when I lay down at night I closed my eyes off walking together him glowing it may not sure yeah for example right now the reasons in my mind that he would be he would be the almighty he would have a certain Look to Him and I wouldn't do the human being but since I started doing that he's put it in my heart to be here no matter what right and in my life the people around me even my mama looked at me and said the other day something's different about it man I tell you I tell you you know what it does it even it changes your countenance and your countenance is your persona your person it changes that I'm sure we have things and I didn't I haven't used to been quiet now loud I've been loud the whole time but I just used to use my loud mouth to curse people out and make people feel bad but now I try to use it to help people so I use that gift that gift was always in my life I just used it in her own way because it was me using it not him and you're talking about God walking beside you with a light in you in the dark one day that's going to do this yeah that's what I'm looking for and you're not going to see dark anymore you're going to see the light because he's going to be walking with he's going to be in you I think in my mind when I when I do that and a thing about the loud mouth thing you're talking about I blame it on hard here I don't know if I got hard here or not but I sometimes I talk really loud I see y'all and I see what y'all do and I see Mark and Dawn and Susan and Gina and I just there's something dark bigger than me and I want to be part of it now and it's going to take me a while to get there y'all for Jimmy I'm slow always happening oh I should have been on a short bus you know don't worry it was full of us you couldn't get home yeah you know it was full of us they want to see for you we were wrong thank you for letting me talk but hey this is open this is Open Bible school down there everybody just like this I've been coming here ever since I don't blame me something let me get it this morning and say come on we got to go well good so I got here in time well that's what we're going to try to we try to do down here what I what I tell them is we try to give you the gravy down here and you get to meet upstairs yeah so if you put the two together or something most of the time how many times people if we went upstairs and daddy covered the same scripture the same topic we're talking about and he'll hit it and just fill in the gaps and so that's you know what that's gone because he and I don't don't talk about it I don't try to influence what he's preaching and he'll try to influence what I'm doing down here we listen to each other and we we feed off each other but I I think you Claude calls it stealing your fire which I don't know if it's too much stealing your fire or not but still if you got a thought you know you can I can I can pull him off to my phone I don't want to do that I want God to have his way God to have his thought with him and then God would have his thought with me so but my friends when I started serving the lord I was tested many times now my friends I wasn't in a circle of drugs but that doesn't matter there's no big sin or little sin it's all seen so the friends that I'm with they would tempt me and they said well we're gonna go hunting on Sunday because I was a big hunter we hunt it all the time it's we're gonna go hunting on Sunday you won't go with us no I'm going to church okay or we're gonna go hunting Saturday but we're gonna stay over the Sunday you want to ride with us we'll see if I rode with them I'd have been stuck there Sunday I said no I'll drive see I didn't do away with my friend I just they just made sure that they knew I made sure that they knew that Sunday was church service June's father he comes over we don't see him but maybe two or three times a year but you know what if he comes over on Sunday he knows one thing's for sure we're either not going to be there or he's going to come with us one of the two I'm not going to stay home for any of my kids that's putting them before God now you shouldn't do that you should put God first and if your kids want to stay home hey I got one at home right now the kids want to stay home they don't stay home I'm coming here because this is more important than anything in the world but my friends pay a little testimony about change I was a class vice president so I was involved in getting the 10-year class reunion our 20-year class reunion well we had a 10-year class reunion in 1998 78 88 98 20 year class Union in 98. we had already had one in 88 and they saw the drinking and the cursing and the Rowdy person I was then but in 1997 is when God saved my soul and in 1998 that summer we had our 20-year class reunion well they did I knew the I knew the nucleus of four or five people that was the class presidents and we got together and we put everything together you know and you know what they wanted a wet bar and I didn't say no we're not gonna have a wet bar but I told him I said I got saved and of course they would say okay good you know praise the Lord yeah but when I went to that class reunion they voted me the most changed person from the 10 years to the 20 year and I went and got in the car after that and I cried like a baby I said God not only did you show me but you showed all these people outside that I have changed and you know what I'm one of the only people who's got a platform I got a plaque in my house this is the most changed person all right okay we gotta go what never mind okay we'll do it next Sunday we'll stay on uh patience myself excuse me thank you
