for the for the family uh coming down the list well let's read them all uh we had a good time at the bible study last night and really enjoyed that we got into a lot of discussions and looking forward to to doing that right now the sign up sheet for the brothers and you know all this downstairs for the fishing trip that will be on the father's day weekend so remember to sign it for that and if you can't come up and fish or whatever just drive up on friday night because we always have a big fish fry and we just have a big time sitting around camp and you can chase all the bears you want to while you're up there because they sometimes come around want something to eat too but we try not to let them eat us but remember that uh there'll be the sign up sheets there and there's a list to tell you what all to make sure you bring you know and uh all right let's see uh trying to make sure i got all the announcements if i miss anything i don't mean to i try to write them down where we can do it but we really appreciate the lord appreciate the day and the hour that we're living if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading from from romans 7 and we'll continue our thought on the the message we've been trying to bring unto you and pray that the lord will bless you i've asked you to read the message of the prophet where he was preaching on the invisible union and you know keep on reading that because you may find a lot of good things in it that you didn't find the time before in doing that amen let's pray father we thank you for your loving your grace and to us we thank you for the hour that we have the time lord upon the earth that we can actually even just bow our heads and pray unto thee in public form lord that we could let our light shine to the world to that they could see that we believe that jesus christ is raised and living among us and lord our love in our heart is for one thing and that's for your word and for your people we pray that you would just bless each one remember the sick among us remember those lord the lords of the loved ones and just be with each and every one have your way with each one guide us now more of anything else forgive our sins because we want to stand complete in you in the atonement have your way now as we read your words you come and speak to our hearts and our lives in jesus name amen romans 7 through six no ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law has the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath and husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of their her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man now watch what he's saying wherefore my brethren are therefore or listen now my brethren you als you also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god for when we were in the flesh the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in the newness of the spirit and not in the oldness of the letter you may be seated the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word i think brother aaron said he had three three kids sick this morning so his wife and the two boys so remember them and keep them in your prayers now we've been on this topic for quite a while now of speaking of marriage and divorce trying to cover the scriptures and the things you know and the things the prophet has said about marriage and divorce and we won't be dealing in that we've come through the series part and we've got over to the point of trying to speak on the invisible union and i pray that if you haven't heard these messages you know that you would listen to the things but now that you would listen as we're trying to go into an understanding now of a deeper depth because that's what we want to do we want to keep on going until it unfolds and keeps unfolding you know down the line unto us to where we can see christ and see what was to what's to be in our day now we've gonna be speaking in on this and and you know i've got a long title written across mine so you don't have to put all of that because i got marriage and divorce where we keep up with where we're going and then got the thought is we're on the invisible union and i'm asking you to keep studying that message and then what we're going to speak of today in the two services and then probably next sunday morning will be on a threefold revelation to be received from a reading of the invisible union you know a three-fold it doesn't mean it's threefold means that it's showing you uh the same basics of anything but showing it in a threefold manner or covering it because the whole bible is um the new birth all right that's what we'll be dealing with this morning then the the grace of marriage and divorce we'll be dealing with that the lord willing this afternoon and then uh speaking on as paul was covering about law and grace all right and the prophet says this is a greater portion of marriage and divorce it's not just uh just speaking on that part it goes into a deeper depth and understanding but i want to speak on it to where we can get a a good understanding because we read from here in romans that a woman's husband must be dead uh there is no scriptural grounds in the bible that you can find for the woman to be able to divorce her husband now there is a case or two because jesus gave it that if man puts away his wife except it be for fornication you know then he's in trouble so it's not a lot in there about being able to just do this or do that you know it's got to be laid in the correct order but paul says the woman's husband must be dead and he's typing it or illustrating you know showing it an example of how that her husband must be dead before she could be married to another man all right and then he goes to show that that it's speaking of christ in the church see because that's what we've got to do we've got to see our old husband dead all right now you'll find it in each one of these threefold manner that we'll be speaking on or threefold revelation whatever you want to call it that each one will be dealing with the death of the old husband all right because that's is he in the body of christ we are feminist no matter how much masculine you think you are in the body of christ you better hope and pray to god that you're you're feminist because that would make us the bride of jesus christ and we certainly want to be that we don't want to be something to try to make ourselves to be the wrong thing so in doing that we're going to have to be dealing with the death of the old husband you know you say well now brother dale uh you know i i never was uh you know i've i've been a good person all my life well great that's commendable but are you born again see that was the first doctrine of the lord jesus christ in other words the first doctrinal thing that he began to deal with was there in john 3 you must be born again because if we're not born again the bible doesn't apply to you and i we say it's my bible that's right she paid for it but that's that doesn't make it belonging to you see the word of god comes only to the children of god it is not written to the world now it is to the basis that the world can take it and become christians but the writings in the bible is not to a sinner it's the and you look at each one like romans in ephesians to to the ones in christ jesus see that's that's the ones it's written to because it's a sinner can't understand the bible that's where the trouble is at it's people trying to understand it without having the new birth all right see then you you come forth within just any kind of a thought or an idea and you think it's well i'm telling you what the word says yeah and it's like the prophet said that time you know the bible says judas says carrot went and hung yourself you go over and pick up another scripture and says go do likewise all right i don't told you two scriptures what are you going to do about it well see i didn't tell you two scriptures i put my thought in between to inject a thought to it and i didn't tell you what the bible said but yet i gave you the letter of it that's why paul tells us that the letter killeth he said but the spirit giveth life the in in it and the scriptures plainly tell you jesus said no man can call jesus a christ or a curse you know is the point there but you can't call jesus a christ unless you're born again he said well i can say it with my mouth that's good that's wonderful you might have even could have been there people stood there and looked at him what about the people that were around him that seemed the dead raised the sick healed the things take place and turned around and crucified him the very religious people that were supposed to be the ones that would believe him when he would come they were the ones that killed him because he was contrary to what they thought but yet he come exactly according to the word but it wasn't the way they had it figured out so then when we try to figure it out some other way than what god says about it or we approach it even in some other way how are we going to get there see everybody wants to know about marriage and divorce or grace of marriage and divorce you know because they got marital problems they want to know how to get them straightened out or something well if you're not born again why are you worried about it right right come on you're not born again why worry about anything eat drink and be married because tomorrow you die amen so then my point is trying to drive it hard if you and i are not born again why do we worry about anything well i'm concerned about this is any way i can straighten this up if you're not born again you can't because it's not even in the lineage it'd be like me running around saying i'm a jew no i'm not i mean i don't fit in the category all right but now i get the point of what we're trying to do is we're going to talk on a threefold manner which we will use the same message quote scripture etc in three messages of the basis and in doing that then i'm wanting you to see that it's what it's applying to all right so let's take it as a first to the point that if jesus said you must be born again all right because there's no need as i said to deal with anything else until we're born again oh boy i believe we're in the end of the world well what's good to us if we're not born again it just means we're fixing to get annihilated right and that's not too happy of a point but think about it now see taking the message to understand our journey and i believe that the entire bible is telling you about the new birth all right now telling us how to be born again telling us we must be born again all right i believe the entire bible then will be covering in marriage and divorce to straighten out our marital problems and our situations of life all right and then i believe that it climaxes with an understanding about separating from law and grace he said what i need to know about law and grace i'm born again well you sure got a lot of bible to understand to go with that that's where we just have to take it and gradually go along and i know i'm slow but that's the way i'm mate but and i know i repeat myself a lot i do i deliberately do because at least repetitive can be remembered one time you can hear it and get about a third of it and and remember some of it but if you just keep saying it over and over i always say in school it got boring one plus one equals two one plus one equals two got into first grade you know that was it second grade one plus one equals two you finally get up about the fifth grade in our day and you finally got to two plus two because everybody now you know there's a whole lot quicker than we was but you know we was a little slower because we didn't get to come to school too often we was all farmers out plowing the mules you know and so the teacher realized well they hadn't been here for the past two weeks so we better go over one plus one equals two you know or something like that but you know just honest you know comical way of saying it but honest i like to keep repeating myself it may be boring to you but paul said it's needful that i say these things unto you again all right now in doing that then let's talk about the new birth see and then we can see that the whole bible will relate around it and if we just have to deal with a new birth today in both messages that's no problem but see the reason we must be born again he said well we're good people you know we're raised in church well that's good the jews lived in the church i mean those pharisees that's just where they lived at they was there all the time but that's the one jesus was talking to when he said you must be born again now it'd be kind of hard to try to tell people that's been taught all of their life that they're righteous and and holy and don't need anything else and they are the people of god so you can see that jesus really did get into a lot of trouble with him as he began to try to tell him you must be born again nicodemus he calls him the teacher which would mean the greatest of all in the original translation he was the teacher of israel the greatest man of all you know the height of any knowledge you needed you would go to nicodemus and he said you must be born again and nicodemus said i don't understand you i've been born right i'm a jew i'm circumcised i've got everything right my lineage is perfect or i wouldn't be standing here and that's true that's right he wouldn't have been in the position he was if if his lineage just hadn't been right if everything hadn't been in place but yet when jesus said you must be born again the the only part he could go back to you mean i go i got to go back to my mother and i got to come again and jesus told him said if i tell you of these things here how in the world do you think you're going to understand heavenly things when you can't understand i'm not talking about i'm you're to know i got enough sense to not to think you can go back to mama and come out again because that wouldn't do nothing just make you twofold child of hell that wouldn't do you no good you'd be in double trouble all right but see when it come to the point then he couldn't comprehend now get the point and this will be all the way down through the messages to understand the problem with those pharisees was their old husband was not dead he said their old husband yeah but they had to log to the letter and would kill you for not believing the prophets right but yet their old husband was still alive now how could you tell people that how can you tell people today maybe that point when they think all of their life they've been in church they've been in this message a lot of you kids here was born and raised in the message as we call it and thinking that what do you mean we need to do this we need to do that in other words thinking you're saved just because you're in the message well did that make the children of israel saved because they were following the prophets the things they could tell you every word those prophets said it was even told that they could take a scroll and stick a pen through it and tell you what letters at that because they'd studied it so much but the letters that pen would go through you just think all of your life and nicodemus is probably an elderly gentleman and there he was he couldn't understand he just couldn't comprehend a new doctrine a new thought because he'd never thought about that but yet all the way through the old testament it was spoke of all the way through that it was spoke of that he would have to come and die for the sins of the people all the way through it was spoke of like who was it talking about that you know the spirit of god joy coming upon us now i'll give you my spirit and i'll put my spirit in you all of that was spoke of but yet the man that was supposed to understood was not capable of understanding it amen and he just couldn't see that he was lost right he couldn't see that this man is standing here now he says we know you're a man come from god he's because no man can do these things unless god be with him he wasn't arguing with jesus about the things see but he just couldn't understand why because they're in the garden what was it that it says i'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman you know genesis 3 15. see that enmity is the carnal mind paul explains and he said to be carnally minded is what death but to be spiritually minded as life so then those that were supposed to understood were the ones that crucified the savior now i wouldn't do anything like that now i'm just too blunt i guess but if we was back there we'd do the same thing they done under the same condition no i i love the lord jesus they loved his healings they loved his feeding you know right but they didn't love his doctrine because he come with a new doctrine a new thought that had never been you know that always was something flaring up you remember they was telling how that that many times someone would claim to be the christ and raise up and go out and you know and and do and but see here comes a man saying you must be born again well now but brother dale i've i've accepted jesus christ as my savior well now don't you believe that nicodemus kind of had a little bit of a an acceptance of christ i mean he put his life on the line he put his job on the line he did get to him and he wanted to listen but he just couldn't understand do we understand do we understand you must be born again do we even understand paul coming over there about it about acts 19 i guess where he says have you received the holy ghost since you believed he was talking to people in there you remember in the 18th chapter that apollos was proving that jesus was the christ and didn't even have the new birth come on read your bible paul said have you received the holy ghost since you believed he was a good believer he went through water baptism he went through sanctification and those things believing but he wasn't born again could we be that away see when we get down to talking about law and grace we're going to get down to to the carnal mind that much more because see the carnal mind is anything that we have contrary to the word of god and there's no way the carnal mind can have anything correct because satan won't let you explain language but see why then nicodemus you must be born again he said yeah but i'm in church i've done this all my life i've been here i'm circumcised i've been a jew i follow the laws i do everything but jesus said you must be born again see the original translation says you must be born from above in other words he was telling nicodemus you must be born from where i was born from right well i i remember mary yeah but you know there was a story told that mary was a virgin birth child no credit of joseph for anything else so he said you must be born from above we must be raised up and to be able to paul called it sit in heavenly places in christ jesus not what our carnal mind can conceive because in that carnal mind you're sitting there now trying to figure out what i'm talking about you're sitting there trying to figure out whether lunch is going to be ready or not you're trying to figure out well it's too hot the one next to you saying it's too cold one's fanning the others covering up with the sheets right see that's the carnal mind and that's death i would to god that i had in my head my my brain the thing that's been revealed in my heart he said well they're in your brain no there's a revelation inside of you that that brain can't comprehend all right with that in mind now this we won't lose the brothers or whatever what we're talking about see then you and i our problem was we were born in satan's domain right in the garden because of the fall in the garden it brought us into satan's domain lost and needing a savior abel needed a sacrifice just as well as cain made a sacrifice but you know cain made a sacrifice he made it he he was from his heart he got out and worked himself to death as we'd call it to get forth to bring fruit to try to do an offering do a sacrifice to a god that required one but able by faith in the blood see because he could see where he come from whereas cain couldn't follow it abel could see that he was born in his mother's blood you know from his father's blood and you could see that's where you come from and see once we're born you're born into satan's domain kin folks to the devil amen whether you like that or not what else you gonna call it we'll get into it this evening on the book of ruth you remember in the book of ruth boaz wasn't the nearest kin there was one near again boy has had to deal with that before he could redeem ruth or naomi to get roof see then we're born kin folks to the devil and i know you don't like it and i don't like to say it cause you know how i love little kids i mean everybody knows how i love little kids and little kids know how i love them but stealing that baby's born it's born in sin shaping and iniquity the spouse of his mother's wound a liar come on i'm quoting scripture is that what paul said i mean david and psalms said it solomon wonderful little baby there but yet it's a product see of not creation it's a product by an act that took place between mom and daddy amen and that puts us born in the domain of satan lost no matter how much you go to church what you do you're still lost until you're born again see then that domain that we're born in this out here this is not god's domain this is satan's domain he offered it to jesus didn't he right didn't he tell him he'd give him everything he showed him the kingdoms the bible said show devoted russia china united states and all the great glorious things he said i'll give them to you jesus never said it didn't belong to him he just said get behind me he even offered to give them to him right said you just fall down worse i'll give you a bit of this an opportunity to bypass death right because jesus was beginning by that time to realize he come to die that's the only way this thing could ever be straightened up was for almighty god himself not a second person or a third person of a trinity that wouldn't work because it ain't even in the bible but to know that he would have was coming to have to die to give his life that you and i could live you see then born in satan's domain that's why we have so much trouble that's why paul is we were bringing the other day and the romans so he said the things i would i do not the things i do i wouldn't in other words i don't want to do this but i do it and he said it's sin that dwelleth in this whole body but he never said he had to sin that's not what he taught he was just saying we're plain old human beings you know and by being human beings how good we think we are we're still a bunch of garbage cans that don't make no difference we're all that born that away all right now then in doing it we've got to be able to get out of that domain to get into the domain of god and see the new birth only deals with the soul of the individual that's why we have to cover the things later of the marriage and divorce the different things and in the scriptures part but the new birth only deals with that individual with the soul of that individual when you were born again the day you were born again it didn't change your body it just put with inside of you the new birth that would work back out to that spirit part of you or in memory reason conscience etc and bringing the body under subjection right but you know because i got born again didn't mean i quit eating but yet i show you the bible that says if you come and eat this bread you'll never want no more bread right if you enter into my rest you don't have to worry about resting you'll never have to go to sleep you don't never have to go to bed you're just all going to be so wonderful now that's not exactly the scriptural terminology right all that happened was was that soul of that individual by accepting jesus christ as their savior and him coming and living in us because that's the point we can accept him and that's what our people do they come to the altar they accept him as their savior you see thousands of conversions we call it millions of them around the world but it's like billy graham said that i have ten thousand come to an altar he said i go back a year later and i might not have ten or thirty or something well they put on record every one of them was born again they give you little cards and a lot of churches and things you know little pens and whatever but does that make you a christian the question i've always asked to you and i is one thing as the prophet of god said it one day like this he says has he accepted you then you'll see the bible wouldn't it all be saved right but everybody's not going to be saved and god by his foreknowledge knows who will and who won't he knew them people in acts 18 that were firm believers in jesus christ under apollos even proving that jesus was the christ he knew there's something wrong with him so he let paul go by there and say have you received the holy ghost since you believe well i just believe so does the devil now where does that put him that's right as a matter of fact it says the devil believed in one god we were all believing in the trinity that we heard the truth right the bible says the devil believed in one god and trembled he's scared about that he's scared about you and i and we're coming to a knowledge of understanding that he ain't nothing but a bluff everybody's afraid of the devil why are you afraid of the devil i ain't afraid of the devil i'm afraid of you devil ain't gonna hurt me you that's right he can make you hurt me but he ain't gonna hurt me people scared as i tell you the other day don't tell your kids the booger man's out in the yard don't go out in the yard you're just scaring them four kids to death for nothing the devil's not out in the yard if he's out in the yard i'd be happy you know where he had on me right here beating me to death in my brain saying them people they don't want to hear what you're talking about shut up and go on but listen so then by understanding the the situation that made us lost then we can understand why we need to be saved all right see take it on up into if we don't understand why we need marriage and divorce to pre-preach then there's no need of preaching it and we take man's ideas and say well it's all right everything's all right and even people say and say well you know if you get the new birth everything's settled well if just getting the new birth settled everything then we need to rip out a lot of the bible and throw it away all right but you see what i want us to do is to take the message go through the new birth then go through the grace of imagining four then an attempt to understand law and grace because the law is not as i told you the other day law is not just ten commandments that's what we call it paul said the law is spiritual but i'm carnal he said sold under sin but then he turned around and said the thing i thought was life i found to be death right see he thought because he didn't break the law because he kept the law to the letter because he'd done everything it said do and everything it said not to do that he was righteous and you know what he wasn't guilty right he wasn't guilty of breaking it and if he wasn't guilty of breaking then why didn't he need to be born again there must be more to that so that's why we're going to break it down and understand it to try to understand and let's just read a few quotes that the prophet of god had to say to us to just line up what it was saying and taking it from the invisible union that's why i'm asking you to read that book over to hear that over and over and over because we're going to be using the same quotes to go higher and higher and higher and higher and you'll see what he was doing in that message to stand there and talk about an invisible union but at least you would even read the title to show you it's not just a new birth situation that he's speaking of the title of the message is the invisible union of the bride of christ see then that will tie together all threefold revelations to come out to be a beautiful picture this you and i becoming one together that's the invisible union that's why it's invisible see the world can't understand that but see we want to just take a message and just go do it but go like the future home where in the future home he covers a threefold revelation first of your soul then the bodily parts of us in the world even to be fully redeemed often the same scripture that he would read but he just takes the thought higher and higher and higher but just think about some of the things go ahead brother let's start with number one we'll go as far as we can and then we'll quit take up this evening these will all be basically if not i'll call it out but it'll be basically from the invisible union priest 1965 11 25 in shreveport louisiana paragraph 206. life is a sacred thing to god and is recorded in a book and god is the author of life do you believe that everybody oh amen our natural life here we have is just a perversion it really should be the right life to begin with see if it hadn't been a fall in the garden it would have been the right life right now but it's perverted by the natural birth the first life of your first union you were joined at birth by nature a natural act so that's going to put everything we're in it's going to be natural because it's a natural act it was an act between mom and daddy that brought us forth right an act that god says okay it's fine to do that but it's wrong to start with we shouldn't have come that way we should have come by spoken word but instead eve got ahead of the plan right and brought us into a natural world satan's domain see a natural human being associated man and woman together associated together in sexual afire which brought your first life here and that's associated with sin and death how can you miss seeing the seed serpent seed no how can you miss seeing the serpent see how can you miss seeing what happened in the garden i know i'm carnal and i know i say things that are carnal but if you don't know what happened in the garden i'd suggest you go get you a playboy magazine and read it he said you shouldn't talk like that well why not they seem to know about about it and the preachers do preacher says we eat an apple well you've got your belly ache right and how come adam and eve would put on clothes why didn't they get them a handkerchief or something to wipe their hands with or throw the apples away see what church we're born natural by being born natural we're lost doomed and on our way to hell right go ahead to the next one paragraph 2 12. that was nature associated with death and watch him your first husband that had rule over you was your nature by natural birth now that's men and women see we can set men say that ain't me because i'm a man now remember where paul says in romans 7 that the man is born bound by the law mankind which means woman and man right okay all right so now no matter who we are we had a first husband and that's our trouble that's our trouble we had a first husband all right your first husband had rolled over you was your nature by natural birth that's right naturally you love the world because you are the world and part of the world that's right congregation says amen your desires was by nature to love the world which you're a part of you're a part of nature you believe that amen and that's your natural things what that's the reason you have to be born again you have to be separate you have to separate you have to die to that first husband that's right so now each one of them each one of the threefold we're going to be dealing with is going to be dealing with the death of the old husband because he's got to die you can't live with it you just can't say well look i'll divorce him and hang him up out here in the uh up here till occasion that's what a lot of people say i i know i don't need to sin but i just can't help it right why because the old husband's still alive i mean if my wife run off with a man and then come back and told me well honey i'd forgive her but then she come back the next day and told me the same story while i'm gonna get where i'm gonna forgive her right because she's digging that old husband up right she's flirting around with something else all right now but that's the reason you have to be born again you got to die to that first husband you can't divorce him no sir no riding a divorcement he dies the nature of the world has to die every speck of him has to die you have to be reunited again with another nature now is that a simple way of explaining the new birth is that a simple way of explaining how that we must be born again now how could you have explained that to nicodemus right what do you mean my old husband i'll have you to know i am a circumcised israelite i've always believed since i come in this message and heard the prophet explain serpent seed i've always believed those pharisees and things knew about what happened in the garden because they told jesus said we weren't born like you right because they thought he was illegitimate born and to them an illegitimate born child was no good see couldn't come in the congregation for one or 400 years now i believe those pharisees believed that when they were circumcised that done away with this sin curse in the garden you may not believe that that's all right that's my thoughts what i've always believed why because they laid on that so much why did paul say a pharisee of the pharisees circumcised on the eighth day see they put all that confidence and that trust in that what they had read and believed that god gave abraham the sign of circumcision which it was it was a sign that would come later to be the baptism of the holy ghost to you and i because that's what it was speaking of that's what i said all of the things as we're talking a minute ago about nicodemus all the things that nicodemus knew of all of those things and what they would be speaking of but yet he couldn't comprehend he never thought he had an old husband it was wrong what about you and i there's a lot of people that never been married twice you know you know what i'm talking about naturally but how many times was he engaged you see the no well that engagement don't count you got to have a wedding you know you got no we've done been through that joseph fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife the bible said there was a spouse the bible calls it his wife all right but you see what i'm trying to get to watch what we was when the prophet talks about she through the invisible union he's talking about the people right men women and all the people all right go to the next one go to number two paragraph 134 going to 135. she was born or married connected with her first husband the first adam what by the adulterous wife of eve because the bible says and adam all die eve was the problem but adam by taking eve took her sin and throwed us into sin by taking her to himself if he just said no get out of here but he didn't sure he loved her that's fine you know what i'm glad he did because we probably wouldn't be here i'm sure glad that them jews didn't accept jesus christ when he came aren't you well you know we wouldn't be here let's see the whole story's got to be fulfilled but once she was born and married connected with her first husband the first adam my adulterous wife of eve adam's first wife you say adulterous she sure was but all she claims that this adam this first adam is dead oh sure he died a long time ago i'm born again she said and i'm certainly married to the second adam christ the word now is that what everybody says you talk to them about the new birth i'm married to the second adam my old husband is dead the bible speaks of the first adam and the second adam right first adam was made a living being the second adam was a quickening spirit but you see what he's saying about her old husband that old husband that we have is our natural nature that's why we act like we do that's our nature that's our ways that's our husband all right but see then we've got to be born again and to do that that first husband's got to die that's what nicodemus could've never caught on to he said if i can't explain these things to you i talked to you about you need to die wouldn't that been something to infer it to nicodemus he then told him he must be born again he couldn't comprehend that what if jesus said you must die yeah plow you know did that help anything but that's what he was explaining you and i no matter who we are we were born in sin shapen in iniquity and a spouse from our mother's wound a liar right you get these little kids oh they're wonderful you know i love them but you take a two-year-old kid you know he's standing there he got cookie all over his face it's just running everywhere he got cooking in his hand and you say did you get that cookie you got no cookie you got a cookie you got cookie all over him who taught him to lie mama don't lie daddy don't lie who taught him how to lie the nature is born under we try to lie out of everything don't we that's the easy thing to do and then we do like who was it reagan he said i can't remember see then we blame it on old age you know i can't remember ain't much you can do with a guy if he said well i might have done it but i don't remember you know how could that person you know prosecuted him but now listen there's got to be a spiritual death physically die won't take us to heaven right see but there's got to be a spiritual death in other words it got to be a death to you your nature and your ways all right even though the bible says ezekiel 18 4 i think it is that all souls are mine and when god created that baby now that baby was created perfect now listen to the wording not eternal right perfect all right the body it used to be but not always deteriorating used to be a natural baby had such a immune system built into it in 40 years ago until it was almost virtually immune from sickness for six months or something because it had that was built into the human body so when god created that he created it perfect he gave you a perfect spirit nothing wrong with it he gave you a perfect soul he couldn't give you a soul that was was the devil the devil can't give you one he can't create and see god couldn't give you a dirty soul where'd he get it from so he made you perfect see god never put us in the pawn shop as we call it the devil starts on that little child as quick as he's born in the hospital room and little fella don't even know nothing but looks up and there's the nurses and the doctors cussing and raising cane the poor little thing starts off in life but don't worry about it if you took it and put it in the perfect beautiful and nobody never said a word wrong the little kid's still winding up be a liar why because that's the way he's born we blame the kids or to blame the parents for a lot of it but still we're born in sin we come into the world a liar that's our old husband you understand what i'm trying to make that baby is born with a husband that is the nature or ways of the old adamic nature of us as we call it that the best we can do would be nothing in the sight of god the holiest we could live what does the bible call it about your self-righteousness our righteousness is filthy rags the bible says the best we could do i've never done that so i can stand here and say i never drank i can i can say that because i didn't do it but does that make me more righteous than you that slopped into gutters with it no the one that has done more is easier to forgive a lot of time all right but now listen you she was born or married did you read that one go back over that number two because you're gonna hold these words as we go through and then we're gonna take these words married and we're gonna move them up in another step come back to number two see she was born or married what does married mean joined together right and you and i joined in my wife we got married we were joined as one right but see in your natural nature when he was born he was born ken folks to the devil he was born in his domain nothing righteous about us if it was jesus christ died in vain was he married connected with your first husband now you see why marriage and divorce will go right on and true then as you're picking it up that old husband has got to be dead she claims we were reading there i'm born again my old husband is dead now do you need the quotes that goes on down through or have you read the message or listen to the tapes he says you say you're born again and yet you're going out living and he said cutting your hair and painting your face living in adultery and drinking corrosion everything and you say you're christians now whether you like it or not i didn't have that understanding of christianity before i heard of this message i don't think some of you had that understanding did you i mean sister gail did you think because you was born again you could go out and live like the devil no you you maybe didn't know a lot of it was the devil but you still didn't right why because we used to be there used to be good people in the world that by their new birth it did do something for them it made them live right i didn't have to come into this message of the hour to learn it was wrong to drink or commit adultery or smoke or gamble or something i didn't have to learn that after i come in the message i thought the new birth was supposed to take care of that nature well see the way most people are they come like well well i i know i drank corrals and run around adultery and everything but i didn't know that was wrong but i was a born-again christian well i'm sorry to bust your little bubble i don't think he was because god don't live like that now small things that you didn't understand yes because it wasn't preached by the preachers that it was wrong to cut your hair paint your face or do something and you went on doing those things but then when you first heard about it what happened come on any more women my mama and them they wouldn't they wouldn't cut their hair and even those that did start cutting their hair later on they'd put a hat on when they went to church you remember because they believed they needed a covering and somebody told them a hat was a covering lying preachers right but get on with it now see your first nature he was born you know it was put in the book of life it's called the bible right and it's there to face us my name's not written in there no but your nature is right the bible tells you what nature we're supposed to have that's what he was trying to tell nicodemus what about telling the man that never done never did never thought about because he he just kept himself locked in and yet you're trying to tell him he's lost you see why it's so hard to try to preach to people in this message because they all think i know i'm born again because i've come into the message i approved it well have you received the holy ghost since you come in the message but that don't go over good well see we've got to have something to happen going down to number three we're bypassed too hey let's read what the prophet said about this must happen to you and i progress 216. you see when you were separated from that union by spiritual death now your union was your old nature they damnit the old husband the new birth is a spiritual death right right okay your natural desire is to cut your hair that's natural you're born that way your natural desire to wear shorts paint your face your natural desire to be is to be intellectual right smart man know something better than the other ain't that in the message i got this first i was the first one to taught on this okay yeah that's what he wanted he said intellectual and doing it but you see there's got to be a spiritual death that's why you must be born again and to do that means you've got to die or why would it be talking about born again you know you got to die you got to die to your thinking you've got to let the holy ghost come in and cleanse out that sin and repent and we call it justification which means that you repent of what you've done chops off your sins and does nothing to the rest of you then you start dealing with sanctification that's why we believe firmly in what was taught down through the ages i believe what luther taught of justification the truth of it i do i believe that just shall live by faith i believe john wesley when he come forward preaching sanctification i believe in that why because i've experienced it i believe in a cleansing and setting aside of that vessel that's with inside of me called the soul amen we see there's where the trouble's at because at that stage of sanctification you get these new desires and your thoughts you want to go to church you want to do right you quit cutting your hair you quit painting your face you quit doing these things you think you're saved that's a dangerous stage because see all you've done is what jesus said when you're sanctified that's what he was preaching he said the unclean spirit goeth out of a man seeketh rest and findeth none come back and finds the house swept and garnished entered back into the house and the state of the man is seven times worse right and you know what the prophet said one day about that he said religious demons come amen religious preachers gets up in the pulpit and they talk about how that will you come into the message that no that means that you've got to be born again well the devil did so he beat us there i said brother you just need to preach sweet and soft stuff to us and get us born again can't get you born again you realize you lost when you realize you're lost you'll do something about it you go on your life thinking you saved and wind up at the end find out you're lost well yes you went to church you've done everything look at the apostle paul all of his life he had spent in that church right probably on up in his age by the time he got converted nobody knows i know he wasn't 18 because he wouldn't but yet he said what i thought was life i found to be death he said then i died that christ may become alive in me in the life that i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god see he went through a conversion he went through a death to paul paul seen that old husband died when he wrote it in romans he said it was dead anything dead ought to be buried you know right but you see church you're going to have a spiritual death a death just to that soul you know a dying to yourself and your ideas a cleansing comes and jesus said drives that unclean spirit out but then the holy spirit's got to come in that's why joel said i give you a new heart and a new spirit or ezekiel let's get the right one on it i'll give you a new heart a new spirit he said then i put my spirit in you see the new heart and the new spirits you can't stand yourself with your old spirit that's right the only way you can get along with anybody is for them agree with you you know better than that they could agree and we don't get along with them you can't even agree with your own self the old ways but see then things changes and he give you a new spirit he sanctified you cleanse you makes you want to go to church make you want to live right and do right and that right you know it always amazed me that the women of the united states and the things like the prophet would say he said you preach to them all you can you go back the next year and they're getting worse and worse but he said go to africa and preach one message and said they get born again and said there's blanket natives nothing but a little small cloth down at the bottom nothing up at the top and said they accept jesus christ and he said they immediately fold their arms and get up and walk out amen and said when they come back they got on clothes but yet we think it's better to take them off right but church listen if that new life don't come in what good is the vessel and you'll see why that if now what i was saying a while ago you accept him as your savior that's wonderful but has he ever accepted you see he accepted abraham's believing right and he gave him this sign of circumcision is that scripture now he done something for abraham right all right now has he circumcised us you know our hearts and our lives that new birth coming in like he covers in the future home he said it'll burn out every telltale sign of satan that's in that soul burn it out die to yourself but that's why most people don't get it see they won't never come to the place they'll come to sanctification and they go to church and they want to do good and they become preachers and they become great deacons and and everything come why didn't god accept them are you with me you accepting him is one thing but why is it god don't accept people there's got to be something wrong if he accepted you right come on he accepted you why didn't he accept everybody else there was something wrong the way they were believing and a lot of times the way you're believing is what you've been taught so that's why you see me hollering about that the preachers preach will you come into the message that proves you got the holy ghost i told a man one time i said i used to read six books a day and listen to two tapes but i said i'd done that when i wasn't even born again he said what do you mean i said i mean i've lost i mean i wasn't born again yet i was a deacon at 23 years of age so you know the life had to be there but yeah it's two years in this message before i receive the baptism of the holy ghost we don't all have to be like you i agree with you all of you ain't as dumb as i am no problems with that but there's one thing about this old boy that all of you know when i get a hold i get a hold and you don't have to worry about it you don't see me all these doctrines and ideas that's floating around the message why because something got a hold of me but you see you accept jesus christ but has he accepted you come on you go to the altar you repent you get converted you get sanctified then the preacher tells you you're okay you're a good christian and you listen to that it stops god from ever making any any more dealings with you about giving it to you see a pardon not a pardon unless received as a pardon but you've got to receive it but then the pardon's got to be from somebody else it ain't your pardon you got to receive it but if he don't give it and remember they shot the man that that story is about why because he didn't take the pardon are you with me but you see church what the prophet is trying to get at we must be separated let's get one more then we're going to have to quit we'll take this up this evening look at number four this is paragraph 222. i'm just rolling on that brother well you separated from your first union by spiritual death now you are are born again are remarried again now to the new spiritual union and he's explaining the new birth right of not your natural life for the things of the world but of eternal life that germ that was in you at the beginning found you that representation of predestination not something stamped inside of you know your representation of predestination that god knew you'd want to be saved oh but i was born with this gene in me you know then the message they teach that you don't even need to be born again because you was born eternal how many doctrines you want on that i don't say something i can't back up i've heard these or i wouldn't tell you that he was born with this gene in you i come into the world eternal life well what did jesus christ die for come on that is your old husband that's still alive that's that guy that needs to be killed that's that guy you need to die to we need a spiritual birth to do that we got to have a spiritual death and die out to ourselves and let jesus christ come in and you know he don't always come in all at once does he brother gary the brother gary talked to him about it because he was about a year in seeking god well i got it well i just got it when i believed well what'd you believe if you were the good old baptist and got it when you believed you just believe in the trinity oh oh now we got into something didn't we good believing god was three but yet you got saved i'm not going to tell you you didn't i'm going to tell you the nature now will prove whether or not it's right i'm going to say this because i've said it for many years i'm going to say it in a way that's hard and stern a lot of you know the marital situations you're sitting in and i've even said that if you keep that natural situation as a problem you're not going to be there for the change of the body i didn't say and i never have taught you wouldn't go in the rapture in the bride now you know that so don't go off and say anything but that bride that stands there and changed in a moment of twinkling of an eye she's going to be pure and all of them old husbands is going to be dead but if that makes you mad if that upsets you to say that you think brother dale has said i've got to die i can't be changed then there's something wrong with you it's not wrong with what i'm saying because i said it right i've always said it right you seek god for a revelation of whether or not you're free if you get upset with me to say brother dale's throwing off on me and you leave you're leaving on your own blood that's not me it's free of me because i have never drove nobody to hell about a marital situation we're going to go by the grave because of our own natural carnality of our minds until somebody sees this word correctly and then they're going to stand on it and say death you're annihilated my old husband is gone i'm free from marriage and divorce i'm free from the new birth i'm in the new birth i'm free from the law and grace if you think i'm throwing off on you you better remember what i told you one time this man was allowed what time to walk back in my body and look out of my eyeballs and see you the way god saw you i don't back up but i'm not responsible if you won't take what's said to you if you won't do nothing about it then there is no hopes there is no hopes of being saved if you won't do anything about it you can shout glory hallelujah how religious i am and all of that now i believe the message you can do every bit of that and still be lost you've got to be born again if you've got the new birth i ain't worried about the body there'll be things made right somewhere i've never t nobody to hell marriage and divorce is not black it's not to blaspheme the holy ghost but to turn down the word when the word is brought to you is blaspheming the holy ghost because you're attributing the works of god to the devil you're saying that person is not saying what i believe you can seal your own doom by your thoughts i'm not against nobody i love everybody and i want everybody to be there but i gotta tell it like it is whether it's my family my kids my grandkids my whatever i've got to preach it like it is because that way it's on me if i don't and you know i don't take no stands no other way come on musicians but have you received the holy ghost since you believed i'm a believer wonderful but has god accepted you if he has then he gave you the sign of circumcision the new birth and if he gave you the new birth come on listen folks why don't you get it right the new birth to receive the new birth don't set everything automatically free why do you need the statue of a perfect man you mean you were born up here or was you born down here which which one one is it according to peter you was born again at faith according to the prophet she was born again at faith we weren't born with everything in us that's why we're being peter says born again by what by the incorruptible word of god and only by the way we hear it and how can we hear without a preacher and how can he preach unless he be sent right so what are we go ahead brother let's stand anybody have a need we just got three
