baptism out here at the pool it's about 108° out there so it's really really nice and uh and clean and got it all fixed up and ready to go we sure appreciate the Lord and and his Mercy because water baptism to me if you're alive and well and you're a Christian it's essential Paul even said to people with had the holy ghost that had not been baptized he said you need to be baptized all right so if you got your s mind and if you got uh if you got your faculties working today if you're not a Christian let's start with water baptism at repentance and water baptism so God bless you next Sunday remember the uh after um first service we'll have lunch and then at 1:00 come back up here all the men that are over 18 that are tithe payers uh and consider this your church we will meet up here for

touch her body Lord and just bless her Lord in Jesus name we pray amen so now real quick we'll U we're going to go to part three and we'll talk a little bit about some of the salutation that God told them in the saman church age which samna means what bitter and have we not been in a more bitter age everybody's bitter with everybody nobody's happy with nobody everybody wants their day everybody wants their time it's all a me me me Le a church but that was seeds of it though back there in Ephesus Smyrna all the way up cuz brother R said we get all the curses and the blessings of each age Revelations 1:10 says I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last you see how he kept that brother collie read that way over in Revelations 20s something that he's still telling you he's Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou see us right in the book which we know John did to the churches and he turned to see the voice and when he turned to see The Voice he saw in other words he saw the whole Gentile dispensation right there in front of him all right he saw the whole thing and he saw somebody standing in the midst of that Gentile dispensation called the Lord Jesus called the son of man and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one liken to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the PS with a golden girdle you can be seated Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word he saw Christ in what bride form so the bride form is what we're looking at All Through the Ages there was a bride in every Church age everybody had a portion of word that they came to same way with us here and he had in his right hand Seven Stars Revelations one and out of his mouth one a sharp two-edged sword he had those things who who do he have in his hand he had those seven Messengers and we talking about uh the last few weeks how that is a specific message to a specific one person not a group not a council but to one person and that one person delivered that message and sometimes that person wasn't around for the whole of the of the church age they were taken out off the scene and we'll look at some of that in just a few minutes about how God does that and he allows that to happen because you get looking at the messenger too much and don't look at the message you get to look at the messenger and you don't see the message behind that and it's listen God's not a respector of persons but he does use people to speak to you now what you respond and you do with it's your business all right but he is going to send seven men he's going to send seven people and that like I always said before if if we're looking for another Prophet God's got to send us one if brother Baron wasn't it God's got to send us one cuz he said he send us seven he sent us six for sure I know we he sent us seven but some people are questioning that and I believe that they're not going to find all they're going to find is is they're going to find if they're not born again they're going to find the Antichrist they're going to find their Superman that's going to try to take them somewhere but it's going to take them to hell not take them to Heaven all right this whole age is a age of deception this whole age is we've come to the Apex or the uh uh the very part of God that's supposed to be revealed and we see gross Darkness yeah we see Darkness on every hand we see everything going on that's just like what the president did the other day you know about um having a day of transgender for transgender people I think you ought to have a day of Christians they're going to make a day and Proclaim something have a have a day for Christians to to go to church and not have to go to work and get paid for it praise the Lord anyhow well that's what they do all right Revelations 2:8 says to the angel of the church in Smyrna right these things sayith the first and the last which was dead and is alive that's kind of strange this whole scripture is really strange if you read it because remember we start out alive and we die whoever this was started out dead and now he's alive all right I Know Thy Works in Tribulation and poverty but thou rich now it says I know but it didn't say I'm going to do something about it we'll read it in just a minute and I know the blast me blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue not of the synagogue they are literally Satan walking around on two feet just as you and I are by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you and I are God walking around in two feet we are the synagogue of God if you're born again today he's not looking for another Temple he's not looking for another building he's looking for you amen a body yes sir thou has prepared me and are not but are the synagogue of Satan fear not fear none of those things which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried hadn't come to that yet have we but they did and ye shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a Crown of Life he that out ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death if you're born again today there's no such thing as a second death you die here all right we die here all right we're going to have a death bear on Resurrection outside there won't be a second death for those of you that don't know what a second death is if you die in Christ you fall asleep you come up in Resurrection you don't die no more all right now if you're a sinner you die natural death right you're in a dimension all right so that's one death so you you die see now we died if we go by the grave you you die when you resurrect when a Christian resurrects he'll never die again amen death has been destroyed absolutely all right but now a sinner though he dies physically then he goes to a dimension all right then he comes out of that dimension on the day of judgment and then he can die a second death if he's not given eternal life all right and so it says here that you're protected or you'll not be hurt of the second death if you hear what the spirit says to that church and that overcometh all right remember we're in a battle not a picnic that's right Battleship not a cruise ship okay and the old ship isign it looks bad but it's going to get us into the shore we know that so there was an announcement in heaven so God has all this plan I was thinking about the other day you know we can't fathom a man standing anywhere nothing going on no a no no no world and his thoughts are the very expression of his can't change and once he speaks them they're Eternal once he speaks them they just continually keep going you and I we have a thought y'all had one a few minutes ago it's gone or either you're still thinking about it now but it will leave and you know what most of us that are over 60 I'm going to say 50 are going to forget what we just thought a few minutes ago anyway all right but God doesn't everything he thinks it materializes all right and listen and I believe that the word of God if it's spoken brother Brown said on lips of clay but there is a spirit behind it not a spirit of man but the spirit of God behind it brother Brown said that's as deity speaking so as the word Goes Forth if the word Goes Forth and it's number one 100% true that's God speaking yes sir okay that's not man that's God speaking cuz that's what he did with Paul irenius Martin Columba that's why I can depend on God sending us a prophet that caught the mind of God not the mind of a denomination of the the mind of a counsel or the mind of another preacher come on Paul tells us I've read it to you three times he says I didn't receive this of man I didn't go to college I'm sure he went to college but remember he said everything he counted from his conversion backwards was dung he was pretty adamant about that he could have said anything else but he said it was just Dum something you to throw out don't touch it get rid of it that's what he did because what he caught the mind of God well each one of these Messengers even irenius caught the mind of God and brought a message brother brandom CAU a mind of God and brought us a message amen and then that Mind Of God is now what transferred into my and your soul soul amen not your spirit realm not your flesh you're very being that's right the soul that God give you and then Paul yielded itself can you do the same thing I know we talk about Paul irenius people have problems with us calling you know people's names well I mean we going to talk about this afternoon what's in a name a name is your persona a name is who you are I can say father who of y'all in here are father well you know 18 or 20 of you hold your hands up right but when I say Aaron Roberts nobody holds their hands up except Aaron all right I can say father you father I'm a son I have a spirit right but who am I what's in your name that's why Jesus told us adamantly baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost hiding it from the wise and prudent know it listen God knew they was going to take that false baptism amen it didn't surprise him he knew they would building and we'll look at it this afternoon and we'll talk about water baptism this afternoon we did it about a year ago but we'll revisit it today because we're having baptismal service but the father son Holy Ghost baptism why didn't the disciples just jump right in and start baptizing in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost well they did right well they did we can't have a versus here you like good versus bad we can't have a versus we can't have a Matthew 28 19 versus act 238 they saying the same thing one is actually complimenting the other it's a revelation that Peter got of what Jesus was saying and Jesus wasn't up in heaven going no no Peter that's not what I said he actually anointed what Peter said by giving them the Holy Ghost 3,000 downstairs were baptized and received the baptism of the holy ghost in One Day One Shot identifying that that name was very important right so as we call Paul irenius Martin the different ones we don't listen the world don't have a problem quoting Billy Graham they don't have a problem saying or or Wert said or or as as um Ryan was saying Spurgeon Moody just put your whatever in there Roberts you know or Roberts different one you can say those names and they like oh yeah yeah we know that but when you say William brandom they go oh put too much on that man you quote him way too much no I'll promise you one thing if we're quoting what he said and it's the truth it's not William Brandon we're quoting it's God absolutely we're quoting but he used a filter called a man and a man's got to have a name right and Bible says Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists there's names behind that yes sir there's people's names all the way down from the time Paul wrote it till now there's names associated with all that like I said the Billy Graham movement the or Roberts movement the Dwight Moody movement brother BR said Dwight Moody put millions in in heaven don't mind quoting him don't mind quoting Spurgeon but quote William brandom and be careful no if you're quoting him you're quoting what God Said same way with Moody and Cal any of those that quote the word of God and give you a a a revelation brother G me a revelation he didn't give me a new God him he showed me the God is already there more clear he gave us a way for the spirit to move freely on cuz it has not moved freely we get into this third Church ages when when Satan starts clamping down on the word of God the first age the second age not so much they were free they had the lion l i o n the lion anointing and they were bold and they they were they were going out into the world and preaching the gospel signs and wonders were following them but when you get into the Third Church age you get into the fourth Church age it's nothing but Darkness it's nothing but death that was the years of Dark Ages right Satan had come in and crept in and he had clamped down listen he didn't do away with churches right he just moved in them just like right here the synagogue of Satan not in the synagogue you are the synagogue of Satan listen if you're not born again today you are the synagogue of Satan so there's an announcement in heaven out of the mind of God comes a logos a sealed up message is open we've been through this before so we'll go through real quick try to get done here in about 15 minutes so a trumpet sounds there's a message proclaimed listen we've lived through this so we ought to be able to say Amen to all this cuz we're living through that we're living through a message that we got to l 00 sermons we've got video we've got audio we've got the written word and signs and wonders following him in uh William bram's ministry right and and we know that it was the voice of God in our day yes but it was really hard for them to see that because there wasn't everything written down there wasn't audio they didn't have an Internet that fa most of the time it's not anybody's fault but the internet service but the devil he goes out there and plays in that box right out that door right there we're going to put a prayer Club put a prayer cloth out there in that box we're going to put a prayer cloth out there remind myself note to self put a prayer cloth in that box it goes into there I it may not be it may be they always say it's out there never it's us so but we going to send that prayer cloth backwards amen we're going to send it up the pole we're not going to climb up there all right but we'll send it back we'll do that after service is over thank you Lord for reminding me of that so there's a trumpet sound you have heard you are under the last Messengers trumpet sounding and he's continuing to sound yes and it's a distinct message and a declared message and the reason they hate brother brandom is cuz he's not out he's not normal are you and I normal Paul says in a way that's called heresy do I serve God crazy the world looks at us and says you don't do what right you you you do what don't they do that when you tell somebody something and it's kind of you know not of the norm and they go y'all really do that yeah we really do that like Mama's doctor she goes to she said oh y'all believe all the Bible you know what every Christian ought to believe all the Bible as old black man said from kber to kber even the ker is Holy say holy Bible but look there's a spiritual war and that's what we're fighting right now it's a spiritual war that Warfare is going on inside of us pulling us one way or the other True Word of God versus false Doctrine all right now remember one thing's for sure God has never had in his mind false Doctrine inside of God inside of his eternity there is nothing false so no trinitarian Doctrine no father son Holy Ghost baptism ever come out of the mind of God it was the devil that interjected because he is the synagogue of Satan himself and he entered in and got people to go well he might well well surely Jesus wasn't God pure God because he cried we we saw him eat we saw him you know we saw him fall one day stepped over a roote and fell I can't be God oh yeah it was oh yeah it was God hiding in Simplicity hiding right up under their nose the Messiah that they were looking for and still looking for showed up 2,000 years ago all right so there's a spiritual war starts true versus false so then what happens is The Messengers laid away or taken off the Earth why is he taken off the Earth so you quit looking at the messenger and remember that that messenger is a messenger from God he lives such a holy life to sometimes you might not be able to tell the difference Paul said don't baptize in my name brother R said don't baptize in my name right so you got to separated so God lays away the messenger takes that message and pours it into a group of people amen amen to fulfill the Bible absolutely all the Bible not to listen we can say God sent a prophet and we can go home we'll come back next Sunday and about 500 more Sundays and we'll just say God sent a prophet and go back home but God sent a message to progress past that God sent a prophet that he sent a message behind that Prophet with that Prophet to a group of people by the Holy Ghost by the word of God nothing else right so that messenger's laid away or taken off the earth look people either accepted or reject it and what happened same way with brother Brandon we can see all these types perfectly same way with Paul they accepted or rejected it and it brings a judgment or a plague spiritual death to the ones who reject their messenger till the next age comes back the same way but now remember you and I are not that way we don't have a going up and then falling off and then there's another listen we're fixing to have Eclipse here pretty quick right full blackout praise the Lord because you and I are the only brid is left and they can hide it all they want to but behind it that Moon's still shining that Moon's still there that Moon didn't go away it's lost a little bit of its light have we lost a little bit of our love you know like the first church age have we lost our first love have we lost that light that that that gave us fervor to get up and come to church that gave us fervor as as as brother um Ryan was saying this morning to read a little more study a little more that's our challenge to study a little more just read a little more get rid of some of the stuff that we pick up our time with that was wonderful brother Ryan I appreciate that first love age of Pentecost was the first First Age it come up ad30 the messenger was the Holy Ghost we'll continue through real quick the alpha age was the Ephesian Church age remember Paul was the messenger he founded it in 53 died in in' 64 to 67 so he wasn't around for half of his church age either but thank God somebody picked that thing up and carried it on to the next Church age so the next Church age is we look and see we we'll look at the picture in a minute but remember we were talking about the porter you got to enter in by the door and you don't know what's behind that door except there'd be a porter there or someone to uh concierge or somebody to take you behind that door and tell you where all the rooms are and that's what brother random did he didn't create a motel the word of God he didn't create the word of God he just showed you where everything was at he showed you all the doors that now all the doors are open yes none of them are locked up man didn't go in there and lock them up no God opened them all up the great Shepherd that's the one we follow the great Shepherd that great shepherd He says look you'll hear his voice and a stranger you'll not follow why how in the world could you listen to this message and listen to the prophet of God pour his heart out and listen to preachers that have preached for 25 and 30 years and then leave and never listen to that voice again now see to me and you you look everybody's going because you're not that way you love the voice of God you love the voice of God in the end time you love what this message does for us and to turn that thing away you never really got the message inside of you you might have got the messenger but you didn't get the message and listen brother Brown didn't save us Soul Jesus Christ is the only one in the saving business now somebody take you to him but he's the one that saves that's right and a stranger you not follow and then we look at the church ages we see them real quick quick we got a Pentecostal age you got Paul coming at the end of Pentecost bringing his message and then God sent an irenius in the overlap to what pick up the one pick up the what Paul had and add to it all right come on God's always moving all right God's always moving he moved right into irenius and then when he moved into irus there was a great man in the lap over and now remember in that lap over where brother says we'll go through it real quick every evil that was in the first church age lapped over in the next age so this is kind of like a chain linked together all right cuz remember and what does brother R always say that the chain is only strong as it's what weakest link all right well there was some we weak links got in to the church and broke Fellowship broke Doctrine broke the word of God apart and now what did Brother Brown say the last messenger would do he would tie up the loose ends in other words put that chain back together amen by the word of God and thank God cuz we accepted it we're recipients of that we're the recip recipients of this whole thing just keep going on down till it finally ends and complete apostasy in the last day if it was the synagogue of Satan in the second age you can very well say that that's the same thing happening in this age all right so the lap overs of Grace of the people the messenger was Paul so let's get on to because we know Paul like I said before Paul said the gospel which was preached to me is not after man for I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ can we say that with brother brandham you have to say that with every messenger because Paul was the pattern if Paul was a pattern then that's it all right then he told him he wouldn't see no more now let's get to the Smyrna age let's get to the the meaning of Smyrna is bitter it comes from the word m sm all right which is used in embalming the dead remember they brought gold frankincense and myrr to Jesus showing deity dedicated to death all right so the Smur and church age now watch brother BR he says thus we have a two-fold significance found in the name of this age it was a bitter age filled with death the two Vines within the framework of the Church were drifting further apart with an increased bitterness toward the True Vine in the part of the FX and see that's what I see in the end time now is bitterness people are bitter people are bitter you go talk to people they're bitter and and we get bitter sometimes am we get bitter when gas is 299 or whatever it is 349 Bread's $4 a low for it used to be two eggs is a dollar used to be $149 now we get bitter because we blame it on somebody else right it's like uh brother Ryan was talking this morning that root of bitterness will will get in if you let it and it'll tear you apart so the two Vines within the framework of the church were drifting further apart with an increased bitterness toward the True Vine on part of the false death was not only the seed of the false Vine but even in the True Vine even in the True Vine there was a creeping paralysis and impotence because they had already drifted from the unadulterated truth of the first few years after Pentecost now watch this and no True Believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and Alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God that's that takes all the emotion out that takes all the other stuff out you take all that back and just throw it away amen it's spiritual health is what we're looking at all right the inward man yes spiritual health and adherence to the pure word of God absolutely that's seen by multitudes in examples in the Old Testament organizations all everybody wanted to organize look what happened to Israel when they went into captivity they went having they had a priesthood a temple in the word of God when they came back they had rabbis theological order of Pharisees the sa he's talking about all the way down to brother to Jesus and when Jesus came they were so far off he called them of their father the devil they were so far off that's what happened in every Church age we got the true absolutely but there's a false that stuck with it though Satan don't want to be out there it wants to be right here yes sir so the age started about 170 ad to ad 312 the messenger was irenius he was born at 130 ad and died in 202 so he died right in the middle of his church age pretty much at the at the front of it and there was several hundred years that somebody had to take the message and move it forward all right he was the disciple of polycarp and we know we saw I I read you what happened to polycarp he was really truly a saint he was he was called of God to do what he's supposed to do but he had one little thing against him he leaned toward organized religion and God hated that he hates nickis you God ha yeah God hates sorry about that but he does you know God repented one time for making man God repented for he said that in the Bible he repented for making man and knowing what man would do when he put us in flesh but he still was like man how can y'all get off that bad yet for all this great testimony the student of John the Revelator was not militant against the nician system he's talking about polycart for he himself leaned toward organization not realizing now if he wasn't realizing then what happened the devil the devil give him a false Doctrine God didn't for he himself leaned toward organization not realizing that the desire of fellowship and what appeared was a good plan to Foster the work of God was really a trick of the enemy deception is not horrible if you stay in it I mean if you if you get out of it deception is horrible if you stay in it all right let me get that right deception it's not bad to be deceived listen all of us were deceived yes sir and we may still be a little deceived anyway but don't stay in deception ask God to give you the true word of God like revelation we thrive on Revelation so now we know it was ireneus I want to show you what he did here this is some of his quotes I read them yesterday the other day Wednesday night but I'll read them again the glory of God is Man Fully Alive you ought to read about ireneus you can tell how God used this man Jesus the Incarnate Word is a meeting place between God and Humanity he wrote the book against heresies which is gnosticism had GN o St T you can look it up online gnosticism is many gods or a god with this over here or the trinit the basis of a trinitarian Doctrine amen of a many gods all right well he was against that so he wrote a book about it he was the disciple of AP polyart who was a disciple of John the Revelator and I was telling you before they were talking about the four gospels and the Book of mbes and all the different other books that were written during the time of Jesus and the of irenius and he just sat down one day and he said no he said the four gospels are Matthew Mark Luke and John and that's it so they accepted that and thank God because that the people that that I've got to wrote down here God picked irenius but he picked a he picked a people to respond to the characteristic of irenius he picked this group of people he picked a group of people to catch the revelation of the end time that God sent us a prophet yes he did every age is the same way sir the central point of Iran's theology is a unity and goodness of God in opposition to the Gnostic theory of God which is a number of divine emanations he was a student of polycarp we know that and he used the word logos John had used logos terminology in the Gospel of John in first John we see that a lot of times we think well brother B came up with the word logos now the theologians knew about the word logos long long time ago all right so let's read this real quick and then we'll close we get ready for communion unto the angel of the church in smrna right these things sayith the first the last which was dead and now alive dead then alive Adam was alive then he died whoever this is took death and turned it into life which is Jesus Christ so who's speaking to us the Lord Jesus himself I know th Works in Tribulation and poverty but they are rich and that's the way it is now you know you got the Bezos and different guys that you know hund and something billion dollars couldn't couldn't spend it all you could buy half you could buy probably half of the known countries in the world one person could buy it right but without the baptism of the Holy Ghost he don't even have a dollar Hall he don't have a dollar he don't have a chance to get in heaven he can't buy his way in but Thou Art rich and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan let's listen to what brother Bram said here the mere Association of kind-hearted people with a True Believer might well bring death in return for their kindness the Lord God Almighty says I know there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation I am not at all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is to so many people you know Prosperity Doctrine and all those things you know everything's going to be peachy King and hunky dory and listen you and I know for a fact if you are an adult human being today look at me if you're an adult human being today without God what would you do without law what would you do without something to govern you what would you do H see there that's why God give us overcoming power that's why God gives us tribulation cuz it keeps us in line it keeps us looking at a higher power it keeps us looking at beyond what life is amen but just think about that it it would be and it's going to be a lawless Place could you imagine when the Holy Ghost comes off of this Earth for the battle of Armageddon they won't be any Holy Ghost left all the 144,000 to be gone the two witnesses and we we'd have been in glory three and A2 years nothing no Holy Ghost nothing to to to put any kind of morality up here and that's what you bump up against that's right all hell is going to break loose that's why it's going to be an Armageddon that's why it's going to be a a button punching time right listen without the Holy Ghost today they kill each other yes sir don't you think the Soviet Union as huge as it is would have destroyed Ukraine by now don't you think all them other countries all get together and fight Israel one time Israel may not have a chance so what's holding it back is me and you the Gentile Church age is not over yet so none of that can happen there is a holy ghost on the earth there is as the Bible says the they hold the Four Winds or they hold the wars away from us right now there's angels yes amen we believe in angels right okay like Israel they wondered if God really loved them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer this is what they ask in Malachi 1 1-3 the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you sayith the Lord yet we say wherein hast thou love us was not Esau Jacob's brother sayith the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his mountains and his hair her itage waste for the dragons of the Wilderness you see they could not figure out God's love everybody thinks God's love is just oh it's just listen God's love is what's going to put us in a place it's going to put us in a place where there's perfect love it's going to put us in a place that there's not a day goes by that you don't worship God and feel good and why that ought to makees that don't make dead people shout what a day yes but you can't figure out God's love right listen if you got the Holy Ghost you're getting there cu the love of God's corrective yes sir they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said that his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact they were chosen under salvation you ought thank God for that because God had chosen you to S to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of The Truth Listen there wouldn't be nothing to believe in if God hadn't sent somebody right nothing what would you believe what if that was what if you just took the name of Jesus right out of your mind or or God right out of your mind no Bible wow he may commit you to death death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that's his prerogative he is Sovereign yes now do we say God we understand that we know that we'll go through these fiery trials or do we do like the world and we raise our Fist and say God why' you do this to me who of us needs to question God now I question myself a lot but I don't question God when he's in it he's going to be perfect if he did not have a purpose look watch this this is his prerogative he is Sovereign but it's all with a purpose in other words what to get us in line to get us out of here huah amen if he didn't have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not a peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled that the Bible that is a quote from the Bible this is where we get the quote that we always quote brother R was going through this analogy about God and suffering he says for I reckon that the suffering of this present time is not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US suffering unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to rain you have to suffer and stand and say I'm being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you have to suffer to say I believe that God sent a prophet you have to suffer to say hey I don't wear pants sisters I don't cut my hair you make a stand you have to suffer for that cuz listen you're not going to be put in their society you're going to be kicked out oh made oh fogy come on I want somebody you know they say that that's in the Old Testament that's okay so it's the Ten Commandments but even when I was going to school we saw some old school pictures and I I graduated in 78 so in h but in grammar school it was yeah Donnie it was in the 60s that we had teachers I didn't see them with pants on in a picture even the little girls didn't have pants on a few of them might have but you go back to Dad's era and show even the girls playing basketball had dresses on so where we come mean where yeah we evolved that that that they said oh that's okay it's diluted down now we we don't need to do that listen God loves us as we are that's right but he hates who you are that's right amen amen what we become so let's read this and then we'll take communion unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering spoiled brat we would be without a little bit of suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic yes sir but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcome listen if he had to overcome you got to overcome on AB that he overcame and sat down his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him yes and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation thinking not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you that's what Peter said is it strange that God wants us to develop a Christ like character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials we are all tried and chasen to Sons you ready for this not one but goes through it the church that is not suffering and is not being tried isn't of God L's stand the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of God how about that it isn't of God this special condition in Smyrna must be applied to every age there's no age free from it there's no True Believer free from it this is of god this is the will of God it is needful we need the Lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be Christlike in doing it love suffereth long and is kind not better let's get ready for communion whoever's doing it come on will we'll read our communion service and uh if you have a need we have seen people healed taking communion so let's just claim that today that when you take that bread when you take that cup and you do what the Lord said then ask him to heal your body ask him to heal your your family ask him to heal your soul ask him if you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost ask him say look God I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired I don't want this no more I'm done I'm finished but remember when you say that didn't brother R say when you got born again Satan would turn every gun he had on you and he knows your weak spot and so do you yes amen I'm going to preach that one day you're a weak spot you know it I don't know your weak spot you may reveal it but I don't know it you know what your weak spot is guess what Satan does too and you better cover it with extra layers of bulletproof material called the Bible praying and reading the message of the hour and listen to the word of the Lord let's go to communion 1 Corinthians 11 verse 23 says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus same night in which he was betrayed he took bread now he's fixing the suffer he suffered a lot already but he's fixing to suffer a most horrible death that you could ever suffer amen just so you don't have to which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had up saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself we're going to stop we're going to pray for a few minutes silent prayer like I said you know your needs I don't I know my needs you needs you don't but let a man examine himself check up and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body which is the bride of Christ for this caused many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but we are judged we are chastened there we go chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world Listen our chastening is not what the world's going to get oh my word look at yeah praise the Lord look at what they're going to get total Annihilation that's right their skin is going to fall off their body while they're still alive birds are going to pick well I can make it worse but you read your Bible I'll take this a little bit sir I'll take this a little bit of suffering to get a to gain a greater glory not condemn with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together into condemnation and the rest will I set an order Paul was going to set some other things in order when he came back so this doe in remembrance of me let's the Bible said he took bread dear heavenly father Lord I pray this bread Lord has been made with holy hands that you would Lord sanctify it Lord Lord and just bless it and be with us Lord may we remember your body that was broken for us Lord we do this Lord in remembrance of you in Jesus name amen now before we do let's have a moment of Silent prayer just for a few moments get everything clear help us each one Lord amen you know really is as Christians we have a lot of symbols that we I guess you say go by um communion foot washing what we're going to do today water baptism but the world they even do that different what do you mean you make your own bread we buy from probably Amazon now put it up and freeze it and keep it over that sounds like a good Pentecostal Revelation you we'll hold it over till the next day but this right here is going to be burnt to a crisp and where it will not be edible because new Mana fell every day new mana and whatever was left over this or they remember they tried to collect a little extra it turned into what Wiggle Worms in it it was rotten already in that in the night it had rotted but not this and the wine it gets better with age dear heavenly father B bless this wine Lord as we partake Lord may we remember you Lord that that you shed your blood for us at Calvary Lord and now that blood even now is a bumper across the Earth that protects us Lord and I pray that Lord if if nobody knows the sanctifying um word of the Lord for the blood of Jesus Christ in the end Lord may they know it today may they repent Lord and be baptized as we're going to the water in a few hours Lord in the name of Jesus Christ father I pray that you'd bless this wine and the partakers in Jesus name amen good morning I walk by the [Music] river the Ever Green Tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despised see there chastised and I question in other words father how long have I got to put up with this you know what till we get perfected we're going to put up with it cuz we're Christians we're not bastards we're Sons and Daughters of God and I know naturally we hated our correction from our parents but don't you look back though now don't you look back now and go they should have beat me more than they did so be careful throw that hand up there I mean we all know that same way with God when he gives us a little get in line thing you ought to praise God for it he don't do that to them out there cuz they're not his children come the right way be the right way read the right word do the things of God to say Daddy whatever you got for me and listen when you was a kid this might this may be we deserved every weapon we got right so then you've done something to get that weapon right same way with God now if you don't do anything I mean you know there like I said I was trying to stop because there circumstances of parents beating their kids I don't believe in that one bit not one bit but if but if if they break the rule they do the crime they're going to do the time same way God is with us if we'll stay in line he's not going to beat us for staying in line he just beats us when we get out of line and remember it's the tender hand of Jehovah he's got nail scars in that hand he hits you with those nail scarred hands just to push you back in the way just like the chief shepherd He had to break one of them his leg to bring it back if you ever looked at a sheep I saw one the other day Brother Richard Wilson preached a sermon a long time ago where brother Bram says he I think it's either in his life story or somewhere where brother Bram said Lord you sheared me one time Shear me again well you look at that word Shear see a lamb produces wool right well they showed a lamb that had not been sheared in like 5 years the wool was like 100 lb the L lamb was sick am I getting somewhere with this the lamb was sick and the wool was worthless because it had come to a place of hardness to where it was no good at all because somebody left him alone for 5 years and didn't Shear him well Lord Shear Me Shear us all to keep that excess away God will be able to use you if he shears you he won't be able to use you if he don't Shear you so let's partake communion God bless you thank you Lord let's read our foot washing scripture and then sisters be dismissed for downstairs remember we'll regular service at 2:00 then we'll have our baptismal service right after the uh second service and and I'll be speaking on water baptism and in the next what's in the name so footw watching scriptures comes from John 13:2 supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of Judas his carot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel where with he was girded then cometh he to s Peter and Peter said unto him Lord does thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter sure to listen to him but Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter said Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said unto him he that is washed neth not wash not saved to wash his feet but is clean every wi and you're clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken the garments and was set down again he said unto them know you what I have done to you he's asking them a question you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am then if I your master Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verely verely I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that has sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things what happy are ye if you do them let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you for this day you've give us Lord we've come to a place that the word and now the communion and Lord we'll take a moment of foot washing and Lord and then eating a natural meal and come back lord and talk about you for a minute and then we'll we'll go have a water baptism Lord thank you so much for allowing us to be able to do this we appreciate the people Lord that are here that are are responding to the word of God that are wanting to be baptized Lord and re-baptized Lord I pray that you'd fill them with the Holy Ghost just right now as soon as soon as we get them out of the water lord may you just saturate them with the Holy Ghost father just bless us now as we go in Jesus name amen God bless you you're dismissed sisters go downstairs
