A Study on the Book of Revelations Pt.93 (All Things New) - Samuel Dale
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
uh the size of the city the walls the different things but we just want to pick a little few things along in Revelations 21 and 22 tonight and just speak a little about it and then try to bring this series to a close I think it's about 93 messages so at least we ought to know a little bit about the Book of Revelations if nothing else we ought to know verse one all right because we've read that for all of that time and we'll read it again tonight amen uh remember brother Bob black this coming weekend uh there'll be an earthquake down along about the the 400 as he starts towards Alabama I'm sure if he's watching now he's laughing cuz he's going to be preaching the Lord willing over at brother Matthew brayes this coming weekend so just be much in prayer for him that the Lord would would bless him he'll take care of him remember brother Bray preached here back what it was in January I guess somewhere in there but he's going to be speaking for for him there so we pray that the Lord would bless him and everything and and if any of you want to run to Alabama to hear him he's in Mobil Alabama so I'm sure he would appreciate you doing if not pray for him that's the main thing okay and remember the fellowship meeting will be here on the third Saturday we had announced it to be up at brother Tom cranes but he wanted not to have it this time so we will will the Lord willing be having it fellowship meeting here May the 18th so remember that and be much in prayer of May the 3rd Saturday of May any other announcements I generally forget something that you know okay so Revelations 1 and Revelations 21 heavly father we thank you Lord for your love and your grace unto us and truly father as we've just got through saying we could spend another year or two preaching off of this Revelations 21 and 22 go all at that we've said all of the days of 92 sermons is buil up to the place of understanding where we're going to not a happy hunting ground but a a land lord a time a wonderful opportunity and we've seen the things and we pray that you would just bless us and give understanding to us and Lord just have your way with us and guide us now as we read your word you come and speak to us Lord guide us in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God under the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and he they that hear the the words or the pro this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand now I didn't spend much time in it speaking about the things but remember this is the only book in the Bible whereas the Lord Jesus Christ himself coming personally to John to write so when it says he sent an angel and watch that real careful I won't go into it but get over into chapter 22 and watch your red letter edition part of who's talking uh I believe I don't believe as some people believe in the message that brother randam came to John on patmas to bring the Revelation I I don't believe that now I just honest that it get too much into pre-existence and it would be putting too much emphasis I believe that was the prophet the Lord Jesus Christ that came to John on patmas and sure he would send an angel or he'd come himself so you have to be careful which way and John falls down to worship and he says don't worship me or I I don't believe that's brother brand and I you know I'm just honest if it is I'm I I I just say it and you know that I don't believe it is because of too much emphasis would be put upon him and not upon all of the prophets and besides the Lord Jesus Christ is the prophet so that would be the one the son of man and you'll get over The Book of Revelations 22 and find him there in dealing with the doings but yet still we believe that God did send a prophet and brought us a message and thank God for it I believe he was a messenger to this age amen you know I believe he's a messenger of this age right I believe he was the one that delivered the message to you and I and how much more emphasis could I give upon it than that to give understanding all let's go to Revelation 21 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and now John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he shall dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is the thirst of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely he that overcometh shall inherit at all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son you may be seated to the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now as I said now I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about the future home because the message is there for you to read it to understand the uh building understand the things what I want to do is to try tonight to speak and I don't if you know if you seen my notes all the brothers has got is is some uh scriptures and all I've got written down is scriptures so it would be basically speaking from my thoughts of what I believe the Lord would give me to speak to you about it and uh you know to try to end up this part of the doing because as I said I I could preach six months off of there in Revelations 1 because see if we don't have a personal revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ we're not going to go in the chains of the body now we can go by the grave and be true Christians and come up and we'll be there and have a Rapture time and a change sure but I'm wanting to be one of those that will be there to where that they'll be changed in a moment of Twinkle of an eye amen that's why where our thought for tonight will be out of verse five where he says I make all things new amen now he didn't say I'll make new things right he said to make all things new all right now brother random a lot of times will say I'm going to get a new body well I believe that right but then people will take that and and from that quote run it into the ground on the basis of that it's not this body we're going to get a new body well the word new is a a very um outstanding word and it can be used in many ways it's like saying in the beginning right well you know every second is in the beginning for somebody right because that's the beginning of the person all right but see when you say I make all things new now we know that from the message of the future home that it will not be a annihilation of this world but it will be an annihilation of all sin right amen that is upon the Earth right all right then see if it's not Annihilation but yet you could call it a new Earth y cuz the Bible will call it a new Earth amen right right it said there new Heavens but is it meaning that there's going to be a lot more created are we going to speak a world into existence and go out on it and live on it as arrogant and hateful as we all are we'd all have our own little old world and we would certainly be set up to where that we would never let our orbit Pace each other or what that word for it is where you spin around and stay in the orbit we make sure we didn't cross each other we life at that but it's pretty well true you know but now listen we saw this past Sunday that there's going to be a final battle to come upon the Earth amen that will be called The Battle of go and Magog right all right we gave the quotes from The Prophet showing you the battle of Armageddon is just prior to the millennial reign of the Thousand Years and Armageddon is after the Millennium so you got two different battles and the difference in what you're dealing with is like we were trying to bring out the other night that see in Armageddon things will be basically burned over right you know a cleansing yes amen but a burning over our our doings all right and there'll be things that will the world will remain to go through the millennial Reign and it'll be a great Utopia they in the Millennium for a thousand years but the devil is just bound dur in that period of time that's right amen so if he's bound his demons are bound all right we don't have to worry about none of them sneaking around and getting out and doing anything they'll all be taken care of and with him being bound they're bound right and in doing that then it will be a great time upon this Earth but yet there will be things a prophet said in the Millennium y that will not be in the future home that's right all right so then we must realize that what he's to saying is that you know something's going to take place and one is the top of the other right the seventh day out of Eden you know the creation the top of the millennial Reign all right we went through all of those things anybody on tape that just hears these go backwards a few Services you got 93 92 to choose from you'll surely find something but when it comes to Gog and Magog that will not only be a literal form of battle you know to anihilate things and germs and nuclear and all kind of things but we found it it would be a spiritual fire a burning of fire from God to even burn the devil up amen and he'll have his place in the Lake of Fire which is the second death and he will be destroyed amen you know all demons in that Gog and Magog will be annihilated because it'll have to go then as say some form of a battle that start and then this group of people will have to be moved over I don't know how to explain it but just simple language move them over into a lake of fire and they'll finally become extinct right cuz we don't believe in eternal hell we don't believe in Eternal Lake of Fire right amen we believe in a lake of fire that will burn forever and ever maybe millions of trillions of years but not Eternal because you'd have to have God's own life to live in hell or in the Lake of Fire and the purpose of the Lake of Fire is the second death which will destroy all people the souls or the individuals that do not make it into the uh time of what we would call the future home because there will be a white Throne judgment Y and people will be given eternal life at that white throne and then from there we go over to uh which will tie into the future home all right so then it'll be a spiritual cleansing getting rid of all demons and things and that's what I kept trying to emphasize I hope you was listening that WR around him on paragraph 334 of the for seal speaking of Armageddon he said Here Comes Satan with all four corners of the Earth with his Protestants and with his Catholics and all together marching right up to the battle of Armageddon right he didn't talk about Russia and China and this coming down we know that will take place we know there will be bombs as I said the prophet said there's a bomb waiting for the Vatican he said there's a bomb waiting for for the White House you know we know that will happen but the emphasis the prophet put on it on the fourth seal I ask you to go back and read that he didn't talk about Russia coming down in this country he said the forces would be coming would be Protestants and Catholics amen well what's going to be destroyed when it comes to Gog and Magog Protestants and Catholics right those demons that caus those things to come into being those doctrines and ideas will be annihilated or be destroyed not to just bind them or or put them in a place totally annihilated amen what about it all germs are could be annihilated a nuclear war could could annihilate a lot of germs but it bring more germs into being right right I don't know where be correct as far as you'd say germs germs going be destroyed but just get what I'm talking about it bring more sickness and problems but what about a time when it comes it all that'll be totally annihilated amen there won't be no sickness won't be no no jur no Graves the prophet said in that future home that's right it won't won't be there all right now cuz that is the second death all right then we covered and then we brought it up to just one little point and we covered where that we was reading Revelations 21 where it said I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth where the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea all right now the prophet has explained that in the future home message that this world as I said a while ago will not be annihilated it'll just be burned over and will be kept actually you don't find in the scriptures now if you watch a reading tonight you'll find uh new Heavens plural but it'll always be One Singular earth right amen I believe that's to emphasize because Heavens is dimensional situations and and parts like that more than it is uh you know anything else else and and if Satan has in any way uh been up anywhere and around and about you know uh that will have to be going through a change to cleanse it maybe that's the point of it say because it does say and we'll read in a minute new Heavens right amen and a new Earth it always will say Earth singular right why because this world this Earth is not going to be annihilated but it's going to be made new as I started while ago that's right it can be called a new why because it's not different see when we say new we think different but that's not the way the word is the word new is mean to just recreate the same thing back in the condition that it was when it was in the first condition amen all right see then that will tie together and and be all right see so we read there in the scripture you know where it says in the new first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away brother random on Satan's Eden said the first Heaven is the Millennium right that we're going to Y and the first Earth is now right now he said that's what it's talking about now there's heavens of Heavens the Bible speaks of right there's heavens and heavens and you know that Jesus said that the the Heaven and the Earth let's see what was that I just s back start pulling a few scriptures while ago and just thinking Matthew 24:35 said Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away am he could speak of it like I said then there's heavens of Heavens atmospheres and are called heavens and dimensional situations so you're going to have to do away with the Fifth Dimension right are you listening The Fifth Dimension is where the sinner dead goes right is that true now according to to the prophet right so that'll have to be annihilated all right the fourth dimension is like demons traveling that will have to be annihilated right and see we living in the third dimension Life Light and matter so then Life Light and matter will be annihilated right the form we see now what we're living on now will be annihilated all right but he said I make all things new amen all right and see making him new doesn't mean that he's annihilating and making new right no something different right that's not the point that's that's the reason I thought well just let you read the book and you listen to the message of the future home and and let me just pick up a few things from this to just see you know kind of where we're at and who's going to be there and what's going to be in the the future home right we found there's going to be great things about the Millennium that we maybe had not considered right you know that in the Millennium there's going to be 144,000 of the Jews Unix for the bride then you got the fal Jew they will be in the Millennium I believe now I'm just giving you my beliefs and the prophet said they will be because under the fifth seal Jew there's no place for them to they get eternal life they get white robes before their Brethren are killed according to the Bible right so if they're given white robes they don't have to stand stand a white Throne judgment right amen now what I was thinking about and somebody buzzed me back to this place a minute but now the Jews rejected to r a son sunship we agree right amen all right the Gentiles came in to the position to where that they would receive Jesus Christ and become the Sons and Daughters of God all right then the Jews will be able to be in the Millennium because it's promised to them that's right but not there as a bride right right you know a wife it's the Gentiles that come into that position amen all right but they'll be there now that's what Wade was talking about there Sunday afternoon you know and I I was sitting there thinking that see we Are Spiritual Jews that's right by the baptism of the Holy Ghost absolutely amen Paul said it's not a Jew that's a Jew outwardly but a Jew that's a Jew inwardly all right now if that's true then maybe it's right I'm not meaning that maybe it's right I'm meaning it to you to where that you uh I got to put another in my pocket to let you think about it Paul said that all Israel would be saved now did he say every Israelite no no only the chosen right amen all right won't be ever Jew won't be ever Israelite that Liv in the Old Testament that will make it to the Millennium some of them may have to go to the grave and come up at the white throne and pleas your case but there'll be a chosen people out of the children of Israel that will be in the millennial Reign amen and you know why they'll be there that's where I sitting rejoicing listening thinking about you know that they'll be there because of us amen right right you think about that because of us you see they rejected the right to have that amen had they not been a bride a gentile Bride come on right had they not been one to come in to fill a position all Israel would have been lost see when Paul pleaded that case for those fifth sealed Jews wouldn't that you and I pleading the case for him right don't you plead the case for him today right sure I thought we believed in in um Hebrews 11 that they without us amen counting Abraham Enoch Noah all of those you're counting H down through there that they could not come forth to a rightful position they without us cannot receive the promise what was the promise come on and listen it's eternal life we know that but what was a promise to Israel this is this this is not the part of the message tonight this is just the way I think all right see Israel was God's chosen people you agree that's right that's right but because of their rejection the way they did it put him in a different place or position right but yet God didn't forget him right that's he said you're engraved on my hands I Can't Forget You amen no matter how bad Israel got God would always come back to them once they pleaded their case through the blood once they plad the atonement you know it was made or cried out for deliverance as we'd call it but you see Church they lost that position but when we stepped into that position it's just like eser that Wade was talking about see she represented all of her people all she had to do was back up and that's what H not Mori said she just backed up she could have set back and said H what I'm not a Jew right yep and she could have lived but he went on to say he said you know that that wouldn't work cuz she wouldn't do it so he says her he said you'd be caught in other words you'd be caught doing what you're doing so you're your life is at stake anyway she said okay y I'll put my life to stake on yep on my people then and see we spirit spiritual Jews that's right are crying out for Israel to be delivered yes sir right when it was over there in Israel Ruben the guide he said Sam pray for Israel I said I pray for Israel all the time the only thing I try to read in the newspapers I try I read the funniest CU to me that's the headlines and I get more news out of there than anywhere else the other thing I look is I try to see what's going on in Israel right yeah but them people have they rejected Jesus more they you sound like Martin Luther you sound like maybe you're still in his day because that's what he thought but you see we ought to be praying for Israel not for peace in Israel it never will be I don't pray for there be peace there that's that's impossible that's contrary to scripture right I pray for them right I pray for the 144,000 yes sir I pray for the two witnesses they may not even be on their Earth at this time I ain't no wor about it but our prayor should be for them and one of these days they'll recognize that we get over there on that other side in that Millennial reign they'll recognize what's going on right amen they may be able to gather around and call him son of David to fulfill the scriptures that he will be sitting on the throne but just remember he'll have a wife amen that's right to be sitting on the throne with him that's right and as Wade was showing from The Book of Esther she winds up to be just as you know he offers her he said I'll give you I think it's three or four times or five times I'll give you a half of the Kingdom finally he just says what do you want won't amen right it was just all settled amen I won't charge you for that I'll just give you what I think we see in the Millennium there's going to be a lot of people right but they'll be there because of you and I amen but then there'll be other times and then there'll be a future home well what are you going to do with all the Israel they went through the Millennium what are you going to do with all those people they don't have to stand the white thr on judgment to get eternal life cuz if they do show it to them in the message and show them into you know the scriptures that's what God thinks of his people but how much more does he think of his bride amen she's the one amen like I've always said Joseph might have talked to his brothers and revealed himself to him but he went home to his wife at night amen he didn't sleep with his brothers right but listen now keep that in mind and think about it and just think about who I is going to be in this future home and the description that is going to be there and we look go ahead and pull up Revelations 1 Brother Anderson we read that and I told him I said now we're going to come back and pick up again so while he's bringing it up he said I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more Sea Watch and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband now remember this as we get on over in a little bit and go backwards and forth maybe if we have time John will be describing the bride and and talking about the city he'll be describing the city and talking about the bride why because it's built according to our specifications you remember I go to prepare a place for you if I go to prepare a place for you then I'll come and receive you unto myself that there where I am there you may be also is that about John what 14 I think it is somewhere it's a beautiful ending part of what we think about the Plan of Redemption and who all is going to be in that City and what's going to be there but there'll be some things there now if I don't get to it brother R said there be things in the Millennium won't be in the future home that's right but there'll be things in the future home that won't be in the Millennium amen yep you got a millennium temple built in the Millennium that's right right it won't be no Temple you don't have to have no uh sacrifices and things in the future home but just remember the lamb will be there amen so you'll never be forgetting that's the one thing I want you to remember tonight if you get nothing out of the message is remember one things we don't forget anything in the Plan of Redemption right the Bible says the sunship will terminate that God may be all in all I can show you where the Prophet says that's in of Millennium but then he turned around and he says says that's in the future home because there's part there that will happen in the Millennium about the sunship terminating but then when it comes over to the Future home and that's not in the scripture where it says the sunship says the son shall become subject okay right okay somebody come along say it's not in the Bible it's it says when the sun ship will be offered up or or right you know it doesn't mean annihilated it means change in form it means it's like the future home the passing from one situation or thought or idea to another one right not annihilating of the world so then when it comes to the sunship of el it won't be that he'll be over here and the father will be over here yeah and then this over here just disappears no because church that's what we're supposed to be doing now we're supposed to be seeing now that God is one amen and there's no such thing as Father Son and Holy Ghost Blessed Trinity but yet I can call him father that's what they life from Brother Lincoln and them said some people up there life to them said how in the world said y'all all start out talking to the father and then you ask the son to help you and bless it all in Jesus name said y'all are really messed up well see I can call him father that's right I can call him brother I can call him savior am I can call him son why because I know what all the meanings are they're coming together to see one Tru true and living God that's is why it said I make all things new not different it brings it all into one view prophet in the church a book gets down and he said Here Comes the Capstone Revelation you want to look at the pyramid behind you and you see the word love what is that that's the Capstone Revelation in other words that's a revelation of Jesus Christ that I've been reading Revelations one one of eight and 93 times already that's the revelation of Jesus Christ that comes to the bride that's why I believe the headstone to the Bride of Jesus Christ is those Seven Seals that were brought to us by way of the prophet's message amen that's the headstone to me that's adoption to me that's the when you see that by Revelation not because you read the book that's right but when you see the the same God on the throne in chapter 1 and you see him in chapter 5 and you see him in chapter 19 you see him in 21 you see him and you see him there in the word of God as being revealed to you as the one true and living God Amen and Jesus is his name amen right but you see I can call him Jesus man one time I remember years ago preaching this message he said now we know who to pray to and I thought now Lord help me you I don't want to be hateful and arog but help me a little bit you know uh maybe maybe he didn't see one God and he sees who to pray to but you see when I was in the Baptist I prayed to Jesus but I just couldn't figure out whether there was two or three of them right but I still prayed to Jesus didn't you and I prayed to the father and asked the Holy Ghost to help me but see the problem was that I couldn't get it figured out which one was which and what was going on right but through the opening of the word see I realize now then I can say Jesus Jesus and realize who he is that's the only name God ever had so I can stay with that name all right but get on with it now as I said in verse two tries to describe the holy city New Jerusalem John looks up and sees the future home coming down all right and as he sees it coming down it's like I've always tried to get you to see that like Ezekiel Saw fire falling down out of Heaven he didn't know what to call that nuclear war he saw fire fire falling out of Heaven he said who would it name said chariots josling in the street running like lightning cars were lights on running into each other out on the highway see not something different so when John says I saw the holy city New Jerusalem he said how can I describe it in a minute he'll start describing it but his first emphasis is upon what as a bride what a beautiful description of a city that you and I are going to BU live in the prophet said future home it'll be built according to our desires he said what if you had the money to build your wife a home that you can put every little thing right to her touch and right everything you know he said but you don't have to worry about him cuz he don't need the money to do it he's got all the material amen right it'll be there there'll be mountains CA some of you like mountains there'll be valleys cuz some of you like valleys there'll be deserts but they'll Blossom like a rose okay let's make sure we keep it right it won't be a hot dried up desert be blossoming like a rose all right but think about it now he saw the city coming down and he describes it and says it's just like the what the bride now remember this is the John that saw the bride go up in Revelations 1 uh 41 right this is the John that saw the bride in Revelations 5 to be the priest and Kings right right this is the John that saw the wife right coming back in Revelations 19 y so is there any problem to describe her describe the city as a bride right we'll get on over in a minute but you when you get over to verse 9 it says come hither and I'll show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and then he start talking about a natural city right see that's why we could just stay for months and months and months upon all of these things to try to bring out the Plan of Redemption that city is going to be built to exactly fit right the bride if you were building a town you would have a th000 people you'd have a th homes you know or something right you'd maybe have a th000 homes but you wouldn't have 10,000 bathrooms that's what I like about it cuz they always say when you building a house if you put in three bedrooms put in four bathrooms cuz it always you know you there ain't going to be no bathrooms there that's right okay so it'll solve that problem but just think about it now John you said a a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away go ahead with number four brother on Isaiah 65 and look what he says look what what Isaiah has to say about these things for behold I create new Heavens see know there's your word plural heavens and a new Earth it'll always be that one singular and the former shall not be remembered nor coming to mind be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem of rejoicing that's not a town right towns don't Rejoice right that's right right worlds don't Rejoice I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy the people are rejoicing not the world and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of crying amen I create new Heavens the new Earth see then what is it but said now Jerusalem are rejoicing and her people of Joy towns don't holler and scream but people do God my point is John is describing when he looks up to see the city coming down he says well let's be carnal let's be carnal if John was up looking the city coming down he couldn't see nothing but at the bottom of it let's just be carnal but see he done seen that bride and he knew this was her home and it looks just like her what about a God that thinks that much of you and I amen what about a God that would do these things all right be glad and rejoice in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem in rejoicing Isaiah 62 go to number five 66 excuse me Isaiah 66:22 for as the new heavens and the new Earth which I will make shall remain before me sayth the Lord so shall your seed in your name remain you're not talking about buildings and towns and world and places he's got his people in mind and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another remember the future home outside of the city there will even be day and night and seasons and different things outside the city all right and they shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another shall All Flesh come to worship before me sayeth the Lord the prophet said in the future home if you listen to the message you heard him talking about how that the people the would come in and bring their offering in to worship and as they go back out they'll take a leaf you remember that in the scripture I think that's in chapter 22 I wrote in my Bible there one day like this I said the leaves is for the healing of the Nations but the bride eats the fruit off the tree of life cuz we're not going to just be dealing with leaves and I don't think when they pull one leaf off and take off there'll be I think it'll be another one right back don't you yeah not going to be a gap or a void but look what he's just saying they from one new moon to the other now I've got to say it this way to where it will follow through and I can show you if you want it brother brand covers Isaiah 65 and covers it on the Millennium which that will be and Isaiah 65 has a lot in it about that the the uh you know the the uh not a child would die 100 you know and things and the the lon and the ox laying down together but brother brandom says that there's a compound in other words he takes a compound meaning so when he gets to Revelations 21 and talking about New Jerusalem he goes right back to Isaiah 65 so Isaiah 65 will be in a two two form part or what you call it that's to speaking to where we'll be in the Millennium and things will be there but when you go into the future home there'll be different little things but it'll still be the same New Jerusalem you understand right cuz it really if you took it from any man's ideas you wouldn't find people picking up scoffield does a good job of picking up the to the the fision between the Millennium and the future home but they still can't get it together like brother brandom had it right all right but now listen jump over to the New Testament now look at number six second Peter you know these scriptures let's just read a little bit 2 Peter 3:10 through1 13 the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise Y and the element shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also in the works that are therein shall be burned up but you remember the word pass away there is the same word as new birth right it doesn't mean the world will be totally annihilated it'll mean the sinful part of it all right and watch seeing that all these things shall be dissolved you know all this world Cosmo what manner of person are you to be in all holy conversation and godliness right looking far and Hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness now if you went went through the future home you heard the prophet using those scriptures to telling us the world will not be annihilated just wipe off everything that's no good and then just start over and make it new will'll never be no trouble will there right cuz we're looking for that Paul say or Peter excuse me says looking for that new heavens and new earth where in dwelleth righteousness look over at Revelations 21:9 now number seven Revelation 21 9-14 using just Parts but what I want you to think about is of what I started off he sees a city he describes as a bride he sees the bride he describes her as a city see you can't separate it but watch and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vows full of the seven Place plagues and talked with me saying come here and I'll show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife now watch what he starts describing and then you'll understand what I was hitting at start with there a little without us they would not be any of this without the bride and her uh closeness to him and there wouldn't be anything else we have no need of it but because of her these things come into being watch what he saids and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great Mountain the holy jerus Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God now having the glory of God in her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as Crystal now here's what I want you to think about and look look at verse 12 this city now are you going to leave Israel out of your Redemptive plan are you going to be as Luther said the ought to be taken out and destroyed of what I've tried to preach to you what I believe that Israel is going to go through the millennial reign with us but they won't be the bride but they'll be there as a promise to David that he would turn out to be the son of David but you see we see him now as Son of God Son of Man son of David the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the bright and Morning Star amen Rose of Sher and Lily of the Valley we see him as all of those things already and you remember the little woman she said Son of David have mercy on me he just didn't listen to her but when them Jews would say son of David he'd stop because they're pointing to a promise right he said yes Lord us dogs I said we eat the crumbs off the master's table that's right he wasn't worried about what she called him right he was no longer whether she was saying son of David or son of man or Son of God or Yahweh or Jehovah or whatever she doesn't made a personal contact with him amen right he stopped he ain't found that much faith in Israel that reminded him like I've always told you that reminded him of what he come to do he come to get a gentile bride cuz he knew what he was going to do sure he come to Israel but his Israel rejected him and he turned to the Gentiles to bring out a bride all right so think about it pull that back up brother let's continue on and had a wall great and high and had 12 gates now this is that future home that your Prophet told us about right it's got a wall great and high every body deals with how much it is up this way and how big it is that way and what it covers this way and but do they think about see it had 12 gates right and at the gate 12 angels and names written their own which are the names of the 12 tribes of the children of Israel if you're going to enter the city you're going to come through by the wall right a gate and it will be Israel right just remember our roots are Jewish whether you like it or not right Paul said don't bear brag of this you better brag of the roots that bu you right right I don't care about Israel will you better start learning to love them because she's going to be there that's right and if you're going to go out of the gate you're going to out of one of those names you're going to go come back in you're going to come back through one of them names amen right well all I want is going down there below yeah on down there below where you get to the apostles it say not a gate with an apostle right so what I said I just want to get into Revelation 21 just talk a little bit and finish this series up and finish it up by showing you what I've preached for 92 sermons that when we get there in the millennial Reign the Jews will be there too y 144,000 will be there the F sealed Jew will be there but there won't be the bride of Christ but he'll be there God ain't forgot his people Paul cried daily for Israel he even said I'd be a cast away but look what he says and had a wall great and high and had 12 gates and at the gates 12 Ang angels and names written there on which are the names of the 12 tribes of the children of Israel on the East three gates roll on on the north three gates on the south three gates what is it and on the west three gates you remember how went through all the years we preached on the camps of Israel and how they camp three three three and three and all of the things and their travel and their Journeys we get to the Future home they're still there that's right if that don't make you feel good there's something wrong with you inwardly that God would remember his promise right to Israel this is the future home they get to Millennium as their thing but he doesn't forget them then they get to the millennium that's wonderful but now they're in the future home well you say well he kept his promise in the Millennium yeah but now he gives them a gate amen with their name on it he still ain't forgot him he still remembers and he says you're the apple of my eye like that wheel in the middle of the wheel and all in Ezekiel where he seen the travel of Israel down through the Wilderness Journey that's what he saw the wheels are turning the thing said the Chariots going down through there the wagons and what thing now watch on the East Gates North now watch verse 14 then we just use in 14 and then we'll jump to 19 to save reading but verse 14 of the same it says and the walls of the city had 12 found found ations now remember these are the gates that was around the wall now it says and the wall of the city had 12 foundations and in them the names of the 12 Apostles of the land they may have a gate but the bride is the foundation is that what the scripture said we're built on the foundation Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone going on up to the next one on verse 19 just just to save time reading 21 the foundation of walls of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stone first one is Jasper second sire third go on Fifth goes on down and the 12 gates were 12 pearls now he's driving back to the gates he describes a wall jumps back to the gates ever several gate was of one Pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent GL what about it that's what he thinks of the Jews and the Gentiles amen they're going to be there but you know those old hateful arrogant people that don't want to love people are love the Jews even though they crucified Christ you believe one thing if they hadn't rejected Christ you would have no hopes of Salvation that's right you better thank God for what they done that's right but they killed my Messiah no they didn't kill your Messiah I'm sorry you killed him right I killed him it was my sin that nailed him to the Cross amen not the sins of the Jews my sins and your sins put him there watch now as we get to it look what he comes up with now remember I said in the Millennium you're going to have a temple built right there'll be a millennium Temple Ezekiel 40 to 44 in a different thing won't be no animal sacrifices in there going on no there won't be nothing like that in the Millennium come on get out of that don't put your mind in the wrong Channel it won't be any of those things but look here and I saw no Temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the Temple of it still didn't have any trouble putting God Almighty in the lamb because remember what I said while ago someday somewhere the sun will become subject that God may be all and in all the prophet says m then he says future home okay the city had no need of the Sun but it doesn't mean outside outside they can have moons and have all kind of things neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did light in it and the lamb is a light thereof I thought that when the children of Israel was in gion and the world went dark but they had light am what about a day and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it they come in and out and the kings of the earth do bring their Glory and Honor into it come in and out of the city and the gates of it shall not be shut At All by day for there shall be no night there right and it shall not be shut all at all by day see what to say a night no he emphasized it for there shall be no night there's not going to be a night and they shall bring the glory and honor of the Nations into it but nothing will be able to come in there see and th shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth neither whatsoever worketh Abomination or maketh a lie they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life amen now let me end that up by saying this leave that last verse up brother I want you to think about something by this time in the future home there is no devil there's no demons I agree you agree as I said when we get that other camera turned around we can see them amens yeah yeah y you can also hear them now on the sound system cuz that little thing that's right up there in the middle that you look up there and see is a microphone that's picking up all of your amens or omes and they're going on the internet so go ahead but listen Church why would God come back to a point and I think he does it in chapter 22 and refers again why would he refer that there won't be nobody coming in and out that's of any vile thing right there won't be anybody outside that's vile that's right why is he emphasizing that there won't be anybody outside of the city this vile there won't be no well now what it's meaning was they used to be Heaven help you because of the white thr judgment things ought have been taken care of and if not then the fire will come down of Gog and Magog and annihilate all you understand but why would he go back and emphasize that statement well brother D like said you know them it's outside now they used to be these things and God still remembers so he's no no no no no I'm sorry you've missed the whole point of all I've tried to preach he said I'll make all things new right if he can't remember our sins they're in the sea of forgetfulness would not the sin of those at the white Throne go to the sea of forgetfulness when not is is's unbelief be placed in the sea of forgetfulness are you listening it's not a gr bunch of people outside that's a dirty bunch of people ain't no devil to make them dirty he's annihilated that's right you see the prophet preached a message that I'd ask you to go home and read I could have brought these but I'd like for you to read it Butz I thought I'd be another hour and a half on this I'm doing pretty good getting through why Lord would you talk about why would you talk about anybody that whatsoever work with abomination to make a lie why would you even mention that Lord I want you to read the invisible Union because we will use it a lot when we get into the marriage and divorce we'll come back to this scripture right here make take us months but look at the end of the sentence and you got your answer or maketh a lie nothing's going to be there there's any defilements any Abomination anything making a lie but they which are written in the L's Book of Life then we realize that the white Throne judgment that I tried to preach of the other day a few weeks back that that white Throne judgment everything's going to be annihilated there and they'll be judged according to their deeds but they'll check a record to see if their name is in the Book of Life you see you think I preach Mighty slow and drag out things I could preach three months right there off of that I'm honest folks I try to cut it down to where just to get you the top points at that white Throne judgment a person will be judged the prophet says if you want me to go back through the message be glad to give you the quotes at the whiteone Judgment they won't look to see whether your Deeds were good or bad you look to see whether your name was in The Book of Life if your name's not in the book of life you can't plead your case at the white throne you don't have a case all right The Book of Life when was it written before the foundation of the world in God's mind no no no not brother Dale I was written back there was the lamb book of life now you got a problem you didn't listen you didn't listen and you haven't listened where I was trying my best to describe back there a few weeks ago about how that there The Book of Life and the L's Book of Life is the same book just two different sections was you listening two different sections of the same book right God knew before the foundation of the world that You' come to a place to have your name written in the book the prophet of God says your name goes on the book at sanctification he said judas's name was in the book said he was a part of the religious order I'm quoting it centered around the worship of God of that day see if you're if your name's not in the book of life it will never be in the L's book of life cuz it's just two sections of the same book the prophet of God I gave you the quotes he said one leads out to the other you realize when you got saved God didn't write your name in the book in heaven the day you got saved a prophet wouldn't say in the day you come to sanctification your name was written in heaven he's saying that before the foundation of the world he knew Judas is car would come to sanctification and his name would be written in the book of life but he rejected Jesus Christ and when he did his name was taken out of the book of life right amen your name can be removed from the book of life right sir section of life right but it can never be removed from the L's book of life now you go to sleep on me and then one of these days you accuse me saying something else and I'm going to tell you I didn't say it see you you don't pay that much attention I've tried to be specific it plain blunt to bring down to you the Plan of Redemption through the Book of Revelations the prophet said he said it's two books y he said that's going to be confusing when you get to that through the opening of the seals and things but then he go WR he said it's not two books he said it's one book with two sections he said if your name was never written in the Book of Life you'll never be be saved the god before the world says to Gil sha that you and I would become Christians be part of a religious order that's right maybe not know the word but yet trying to believe in the God and he'd write her name in the book of life before the world ever begun but you better hold on now for a minute because when you get into the indivisible Union you find the prophet saying it like this he said your name is transferred that's right he said there's no such thing as a new name been written down in heaven he said it's all written before the world he said but that's in the Book of Life but then he went on to see those that would accept Jesus Christ and become fully Born Again Christians not just be a Judas as a religious order that could have their names removed but he would see some whose names would be in the section called the Lamb's Book of Life slain Revelation 8 138 slain before the foundation of the world but you see church if you don't see your name transferred that's right can't you see that you was part of a religious order I was part of a religious order and then when we did receive the new birth that that brought eternal life to you and I and our soul and our name was transferred he said it's not going to be a space that's empty right but he said your name was transferred transferred from The Book of Life to the Lamb's Book of Life that's right not transferred like transferring and racing out one writing it on the other I've never preached nothing like that but when you come to the realization that that new birth you got inside of you is eternal life dire is your name in the Lamb's Book of Life am you realize that was there it wasn't just transferred it was racing out all of the Deeds that you done and the things that existed in the book of life and you come to a realization that God is eternal now for a moment to try to prove that because you say well you got to have Bible all right Brother Anderson pull life scriptures back up please sir see I like to be able to put it in the scripture that's right then when I got it in the scripture I don't have to worry about it rolling up to the light to where we were getting to the won't be nobody in there end that's got anything left won't be no defilement won't be nobody working Abomination got any problems it won't be you out here well I'm just can't help it no all of that's gone I create all things new so think about it all those Old Testament Jews that had their name in The Book of Life they would really stay with the word as best as they could they will be given eternal life their name will prove that it was on the book of life but they will be placed in the Eternal section come on if they're giv eternal life even somebody to White thrown judgment a foolish virgin is given eternal life their name will be BR moved into the lamb Book of Life which is eternal life The Plan of Redemption to look at Israel and see all of those people that comes up into the future home they'll come in and out they bring their Glory and Honor in too they just can't stay they can come to visit they can't stay why cuz there where the bride is no room for them no place for them other than coming in getting a leaf and going back out but they'll be just as Eternal in Soul and body and spirit I don't believe if I'm wrong correct me I don't believe when we get to the Future home there's going to be a bunch of people running around that are not Eternal I don't believe it I believe in the Millennium they can be a gentile that raise it up that will not be Eternal but I've done preach to you over and over to show you the F shal Jew don't go to the white Throne judgment so they'll go into the Millennium with eternal life Israel is an a hold of the collective you know the special chosen of Israel in the Millennium they won't have to be there as natural people they'll be there too cuz they have eternal life 144,000 they have eternal life yep but when you go to the Future home it ain't nobody there they don't have eternal life amen but it's because we chose I hope you can read invisible Union and see where the Prophet said your name was transferred well you mean it wasn't over there no he goes on he said it won't be a blank space see you and I that's what the new birth is the new birth is not to wait till the white Throne judgment and get eternal life the new birth is not Israel to receive eternal life and be in the Millennium and things the new birth is for you and I to realize our name has been transferred we may have been part of a religious order of our day and centered around worship and going to church and things but when you receive that new birth your soul is eternal right there's the Lamb's Book of Life The Plan of Redemption 93 sermons to preach one message tonight The Plan of Redemption to see who all there not to figure out how big the city is and how much it' be and what it covers and but to see who's going to be there those Apostles will be the foundation Those Old Testament Patriarchs the 12 tribes you know the is children of Israel there'll be the gates amen what about a city that beautiful let stand come on Brothers I hope that this has been a series you've enjoyed I kind of hate to stop because it just so much that you could preach on I love to talk about my savior my Lord cuz you see there ain't going to be no night there there ain't going to be no need of the sun ain't going to be none of that but the lamb will be there when that sunship comes to an existence that it's no longer needed in the form of redemption your lamb the lamb won't be gone see I don't know where you've ever caught the way I believe in one God I don't believe that you're here and going upward you know I believe Father Son and Holy Ghost is coming down so when you see the lamb there in the city you'll know he's God Amen you'll know who he is all the attributes will be standing in front of us the form of the Lamb it's not going up it's coming down the city's not going up the city's coming down dwelling on this Earth what we got brother 392 in the readed book 392 anybody have a need yeah think on these things the Plan of Redemption Proclaim Jesus the light of world how about it see it can you see Redemption that way we don't leave anybody out drop Mercy are shine all around by and by Jesus the light of the world why would that little bride be Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostal Catholics that are the true I believe what Martin Luther T of the just shall live by faith I believe what John Wesley taught of sanctification I believe what the Baptist taught of immersing baptizing I believe in the grace of God but there just won't be little groups when we get there but I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist we all be Christians what about it with TR the narrow way Jesus the light on world walk in the anybody have a need come where the drops of Mercy are bright shine all around us by day and by night Jesus the light what about it what do you think about Redemption what about being able to take the Book of Revelations that we were told to stay out of be able to preach the Plan of Redemption out of a book that we were told not to read oh now brother D they never did tell us no they told you couldn't told you they you couldn't understand it right they didn't tell you not to read it no no no they told you you couldn't understand it so that automatically put a fear in your heart and you wouldn't you wouldn't read it the bride book you remember how long has that been ago a couple two or three years ago the bride's book The Book of Revelation the complete Plan of Redemption for man in the world see brother randam get in the future home and say th Jesus good on Earth at his baptism and he said down from heaven come the holy city New Jerusalem lighting up on an entire redeemed Earth that's what he says about him liting on Jesus Christ are redeemed entire Earth he say because from his body being redeemed he redeemed our bodies what about him you are more beautiful than and nothing compares to one more time before we go Lord you are the three most valuable things you are more costly than go what about it the three things that people kill around the world are fighting over those three things and we look at him and see him I Des comp think about him think about what he's done for you and I that's right remember we kept on reading blessed are they that hear this prophecy cuz we're talking about a prophecy tonight we're talking about a future home a millennium amen and the things yet to come but yet we can stand here and know what's going to take place there and know that we don't have to stand before the white throne right amen and know that we can sit there with him on his thr that's what I've always said you just think what it's going to come to the people you're testifying to they'll walk before you and God will simply turn and say did you tell them that yes but you see well you can say well I just won't tell nobody then but then the Bible says then their blood is on your hand so which way do you want it you want their blood on your hand or do you want to try to relieve them from their pressure of the blood you know get the blood to them see I know by preaching that I hurt feelings I know by doing it I hurt feelings CU I have to take a stand you think I enjoy just being able to holler and scream at people no I take a stand though I've got to to preach the truth that's right and speak it like it I believe it and then if I do then see that's a problem that I've always had with the preachers this message they won't tell you what they believe right you know they'll get right up here we've had them this pull pit get up here and say I'm going to get a new body you go outside and you kind of talk around a little bit you know and you say well you know you know you getting a new body said I don't mean different it's this body yeah that's what I believe it's this body redeemed but they stood here and said they're going to get a new body so you can't determine what they believe right but there one thing about it you know for sure that you know what I believe all right father we've committed this service to you Lord in this whole series and Lord we just ask you to come now and help us to see ourselves and to realize realization and walk on with you Lord forgive our sins cleanse us as we
