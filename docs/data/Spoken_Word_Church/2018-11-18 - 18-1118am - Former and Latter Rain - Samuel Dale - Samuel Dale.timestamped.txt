[6:05] Hosea 6 John to Hosea 6 good to see
[6:10] everybody here this morning we want to
[6:13] make sure and thank brother Bob and
[6:16] brother Louise for taking over the
[6:18] services while we were gone away for
[6:21] hunting a few days and had a good time
[6:23] didn't do much good with the killing
[6:26] time but we had a good time fellowship
[6:27] inion you know all the little rest time
[6:30] out of it and that was good so we thank
[6:33] God for that
[6:34] all right now remember for this coming
[6:38] Tuesday now not ever Tuesday from now on
[6:44] thereby got it this coming Tuesday which
[6:49] will set in motion for us for we will
[6:53] have services on Tuesday of this week
[6:58] not Wednesday because of your
[7:03] Thanksgiving time okay
[7:06] everybody with me so that for their
[7:08] services and we'll start it from now on
[7:10] tour in the month of November when we
[7:13] have the Thanksgiving that will have the
[7:17] Tuesday night service instead of a
[7:20] Wednesday night service okay so
[7:22] everybody's got that now see a lot of
[7:24] people who say well I didn't hear you
[7:26] say that I heard you say we're gonna
[7:27] change the service institute I didn't
[7:29] say that I said we're gonna change it
[7:32] for one month out of the year to order
[7:35] that we can have the services and that
[7:38] way you could be with your families and
[7:39] all on the Thanksgiving the time okay so
[7:43] we got that part no all right let's see
[7:48] - Wade will be ministering the Lord
[7:51] willing
[7:52] on that day okay I've got something to
[7:56] say to you I put a sign on the door
[7:58] downs tires going down the door that
[8:02] goes out you know and and I've been
[8:06] coming in a lot of times you know we
[8:08] don't go down and check that door but
[8:10] I'd find it open you know or unlock the
[8:14] door without going down and turn and go
[8:16] down the bottom okay everybody got it
[8:18] and I made a note and put it up there
[8:21] please do not unlock this door
[8:25] well you know what come in today and
[8:28] it's unlocked so now somebody can't read
[8:32] or really there can't obey instructions
[8:36] see somebody went out that door left the
[8:39] door unlocked okay if they want to break
[8:43] in then they're gonna get what they want
[8:45] and don't have to tear down the doors we
[8:47] put locks on the doors to try to keep
[8:49] out these when you put a sign on the
[8:51] outside the door said this door was left
[8:53] open you know don't do that all right
[8:58] so please there's no need of going out
[9:01] that door
[9:02] there's no reason it's only a safety
[9:04] purposes when you going down the
[9:07] stairway we turn left go out if you turn
[9:09] right you just going down into the
[9:11] bottom and going out that's only for
[9:13] safety purposes you know not for you to
[9:16] go in and out you know we would we don't
[9:20] want to nail it too because it wouldn't
[9:22] be no purpose for the door all right so
[9:25] if you would make sure don't go down
[9:28] that away we'll probably wind up and put
[9:30] one of those crime sticker tapes but I
[9:34] know people they'll raise that up walk
[9:38] right under it and go do what you want
[9:40] to do right but just remember now don't
[9:46] be doing that because you know if you
[9:49] get in if they get in here they can get
[9:50] what you want - like that okay so we've
[9:53] got that taken care of and all of the
[9:55] things alright just pray one for another
[9:58] let's go right on into our scriptures
[10:00] and do it as any other announcements
[10:02] Terrance has made the other announcement
[10:05] the children are going to practice this
[10:09] afternoon okay
[10:12] after the eating the children gonna
[10:14] practice okay we're going to start a
[10:17] thing who were that the children you
[10:22] know and they don't have this fully set
[10:24] which week or what all right we had
[10:27] discussed moving the evening service to
[10:30] try to help but that won't help because
[10:33] it's gonna put us later in the day all
[10:35] right so we're not going to do it that
[10:37] away but what we're going to do is
[10:39] somebody will have to set a schedule and
[10:42] get it to where they can have rotate the
[10:45] children as to practicing after the
[10:50] evening service now I still if you want
[10:53] to come in practice between the services
[10:56] all right you with me if you want to
[10:59] come in special things do whatever
[11:02] between the services just do by the
[11:04] order that we've tried to go by is get
[11:07] through by 1:30 where we can you know
[11:11] not be in interfering with the evening
[11:13] service all right so we're not doing it
[11:15] away with the practice between the
[11:16] services everybody got it but they're
[11:20] setting it for the children to practice
[11:23] for them to how after the evening
[11:26] service and they can rotate that like
[11:30] and have one one week one next week
[11:32] whatever they want to do to try to
[11:35] practice more because we need more
[11:37] practice I understand that but we don't
[11:39] have the facilities the abilities and
[11:42] the things and we don't want to move the
[11:45] evening service because especially in
[11:48] this short period of time of the evening
[11:50] you know those now it's little after
[11:52] 5:00 it's getting dark so we don't want
[11:55] to do that and move you up 30 minutes
[11:57] just to do that so but the children now
[12:00] do you understand me the adults who
[12:02] handle the singing of the things set up
[12:05] your schedule get everything going get
[12:08] with the musicians connect it all
[12:10] together to where that you can have that
[12:13] you know after the evening service cuz
[12:17] listen you're outside for
[12:19] our right you're outside for an hour
[12:24] after the evening service talking
[12:27] well when the evening service ends here
[12:29] you can just children just come right on
[12:30] up and everything schedule and you
[12:33] practice for a little while uh-huh it's
[12:36] not adding no time to nobody because
[12:39] you're gonna be out there anyway
[12:40] it's just consuming or you know what do
[12:44] you call that redeeming the time to
[12:47] where we can do it okay but just think
[12:50] of those things now there's services I
[12:52] mean the times of the practice and the
[12:54] thing father we thank you for this day
[13:01] in your grace we thank you for your love
[13:03] we thank you for every time we just ask
[13:05] you now that you'd give us a vial of and
[13:07] that understanding and how to present
[13:09] Lord want you to have for each one of us
[13:12] we need you so much and we thank you
[13:15] just have your way just open our
[13:17] understanding to thy word and let your
[13:20] hearts and your love be with each one of
[13:21] us guide us forgive our sins and keep us
[13:25] that's your grace be sufficient we
[13:27] believe you and we thank you in Jesus
[13:29] name very for me your scripture with us
[13:35] but I'm wondering if we understand it so
[13:39] that's why I want to take an opportunity
[13:42] if not will if we don't finish you today
[13:44] we will try to get it you know a little
[13:48] later Joel - beginning about verse 22 be
[13:55] not afraid you beasts of the field for
[13:58] the pastures of the wilderness to spring
[14:00] for the three bars her fruit in her fig
[14:04] the fig tree and deveined do yield her
[14:08] strength be glad then you children of
[14:11] Zion and resource choice in the Lord
[14:15] your God for he had given you the former
[14:17] rain moderately and will cause to come
[14:20] down for you the rain the former rain
[14:25] and the latter rain in the first month
[14:29] now what that is totally
[14:33] there is no planting ability to plant
[14:36] and redeem within a month so get the
[14:42] point don't start from where we've done
[14:43] no it's an expression or a thought to
[14:48] coming forth as to what is to take place
[14:50] because this is what's to take place the
[14:53] floor shall be full of wheat and the fad
[14:56] shall overflow with wine and all and I
[14:59] will restore to you the years that the
[15:02] locust has eaten the cankerworm and the
[15:04] caterpillar and the Palmer were my great
[15:06] army which I sent among you and you
[15:09] shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and
[15:11] praise the name of the Lord your God
[15:13] that have dealt wonderfully with you and
[15:16] my people shall never be ashamed and you
[15:19] shall know that I am in the midst of
[15:21] Israel and that I am the Lord your God
[15:25] and none else and my people shall never
[15:28] be ashamed and it shall come to pass
[15:31] afterward now watch this afterward when
[15:38] we get into Hosea okay and it shall come
[15:41] to pass afterward that I pour out my
[15:44] spirit upon all flesh and your sons and
[15:48] your daughters shall prophesy your old
[15:50] men shall dream dreams your young men
[15:53] shall see visions and also upon the
[15:56] servants and upon the handmaids in those
[15:59] days but I pour out my spirit can't go
[16:03] to Hosea 6 come and let us return unto
[16:09] the Lord for he has torn and he and he
[16:12] will heal he had smitten and he will
[16:14] bind us up remember take a warm pond
[16:17] warm locals caterpillar eating down it
[16:20] comes back what's it now after two days
[16:26] will he revive us after two days in the
[16:31] third day he will raise us up and we
[16:35] shall live in his sight then see when
[16:39] that happens here you know if you follow
[16:43] on to know the Lord
[16:45] is going forth is prepared as the
[16:47] morning and he shall come unto us as the
[16:51] rain as the latter and former rain unto
[16:55] the earth you may be seated the Lord
[16:57] that is blessing to the reading of the
[17:00] word pray for my throat this morning
[17:03] I've had sinus problems or whatever in
[17:06] this it's got a gov Aten but no listen
[17:13] that's what I say it we read the Bible
[17:15] you know you know we don't pay close
[17:19] attention to what it's saying a lot of
[17:22] times we get our idea our concept or
[17:26] thought see and we say well we got it
[17:30] you know we know that well that may be
[17:35] true if it is true but it may not be
[17:40] true it may be that we are making the
[17:44] Bible say something that it doesn't say
[17:47] all right then mankind can read it and
[17:51] say well look at all of the
[17:54] contradictions that are in the Bible
[17:58] well I've always said it you know if you
[18:00] can find one to come and tell me now
[18:03] don't come and tell me something little
[18:04] silly thing come and tell me so I'll
[18:06] show me a contradiction in the word and
[18:09] I'll be glad to discuss it with you not
[18:11] whether they one blind man or two blind
[18:14] men or you know because you got
[18:16] differences in the writings all right
[18:19] now but what I want you to think about
[18:23] is it's probably about six times five
[18:28] times I know at least in the Bible that
[18:30] it speaks of the former and latter rain
[18:33] alright and there's where the reason I
[18:38] chose to read this one is work says
[18:40] within the first month well we start off
[18:44] immediately saying we do not understand
[18:47] them the way it states it so it must be
[18:54] stating it for some reason for it to be
[18:57] within one month
[18:59] there's no such thing as any way to
[19:03] plant any food and one month later you
[19:07] gather it so then immediately we know
[19:11] that it's not saying what we think well
[19:14] it's just from planting rain and it and
[19:15] the gathering right you know it's just
[19:18] it's just that's the former and latter
[19:20] rain but remember this before we get
[19:23] into the message at all remember this
[19:26] point the rain is the same is this the
[19:33] position that it's occurring in it's
[19:38] like we've just finished the series on
[19:40] the statue of a perfect man and talking
[19:42] about cornerstone and headstone it's the
[19:45] same stone but it's the position that
[19:48] the stone is in is what you're dealing
[19:51] with
[19:51] not the fact of trying to make it two
[19:54] different stones or something you know
[19:57] it's not that away so don't try to make
[19:59] it two different rains make it what it
[20:04] is it's the form of rain and then a lot
[20:08] of rain all right as I said then - don't
[20:13] try to narrow your mind to the thoughts
[20:16] because even over in James it says the
[20:20] husbandmen which is Almighty God is
[20:23] waiting himself patiently for the former
[20:28] and latter rain now would God be waiting
[20:32] for the former and latter rain or is
[20:34] that a statement that he's waiting for a
[20:38] time to produce the rain it's not the
[20:44] basis of whether he's waiting for it to
[20:46] come you know it's the basis that he has
[20:51] set a time frame or whatever and he's
[20:55] saying well it won't come till this time
[20:58] this time I'll wait patiently I would
[21:01] like to finish it up you know I'd like
[21:03] to cut the scripture would say the work
[21:06] short you know I'd like to do that but I
[21:09] won't I make my promise and I'll keep my
[21:12] promised and I'll bring it to Pais when
[21:14] when I'm bringing it to PI's it's not
[21:16] dealing with him waiting himself
[21:20] it's him waiting for a time to make that
[21:23] manifest in you and I so get that
[21:27] thought in your mind of this about the
[21:30] former and latter rain alright now we
[21:35] take the natural story of the former and
[21:38] latter rain to connect it together to
[21:41] bring it to the spiritual okay now the
[21:44] word more art teaching rain the is what
[21:49] you're dealing with but let me state
[21:51] this before we start we're not dealing
[21:58] with the seed you know or thoughts they
[22:08] so get that settled in your mind alright
[22:11] because the rain has nothing to do with
[22:15] the seed if you don't put the seed in
[22:19] the ground the rain does no good the
[22:24] rain is too quickly or make alive what
[22:28] you plant all right so former rain or
[22:32] you would be around the world all those
[22:34] difference in all kind of seeds and
[22:36] plantings and things but the main point
[22:39] is for one thing that there's a planting
[22:45] time and a harvest time all right
[22:49] so in the natural you have as you go out
[22:52] and you get your ground ready you get
[22:55] your your tight and you you put your
[22:58] seed in the ground and if you're in an
[23:00] area that does not have enough moisture
[23:02] to be able to quicken that seed you pour
[23:07] a little water with it or maybe like
[23:10] cabbage onions or something like that
[23:14] you dig a hole all right
[23:16] that's the way we are here basically see
[23:18] and you dig a hole and you don't just
[23:23] stick that cabbage plant or onion or
[23:25] tomato plant
[23:26] whatever you don't just stick it down in
[23:28] dry ground it's going to die all right
[23:32] so what do you do you pour some water on
[23:35] it but you don't pour gallons of water
[23:41] you only pour enough water for it to be
[23:45] able to start its growth because if not
[23:50] you're going to drink drowned out the
[23:52] plant and kill the plant or artist the
[23:56] things I've even done it and I know you
[23:58] have I've known that it was pretty dry
[24:01] and I've taken and put my seed in the
[24:03] ground and and then sprinkle a little
[24:05] water over it you know I mean I don't
[24:08] flood the whole garden
[24:09] I don't put four or five inches I just
[24:12] put a little bit enough to germinate
[24:16] that seed but now here's the point what
[24:21] does it matter about the rain former or
[24:23] latter and you'll see that as we
[24:25] continue to thought that what does it
[24:30] matter about the rain if you have no
[24:33] seed for it to follow them right and see
[24:40] remember this about the former and
[24:43] latter right remember what we read then
[24:48] we got to promise in the scripture that
[24:50] he would pour out of his spirit upon all
[24:54] flesh and your sons and daughters will
[24:58] prophesy here you know you know all the
[25:00] things it's poured out on everything
[25:02] when it when it rains or even if you dig
[25:06] a hole and you pour water there you know
[25:09] yourself that you dig it out you put a
[25:12] tomato plant well you go back out turn
[25:14] about a week later and you tomato plants
[25:16] just setting up you know it's not doing
[25:18] do good because it you know it's it's
[25:21] getting this connection to the ground
[25:23] but you look around it and here's all
[25:25] these little morning glories growing up
[25:27] all around it you got to clean them out
[25:30] alright see the natural point of what
[25:33] you're talking about the rain that falls
[25:37] on the just and the unjust according to
[25:41] all right these in whatever rain it is
[25:46] remember it's for all seeds to come to
[25:51] growth it's for them to grow up it's for
[25:57] them to become mature it's for them to
[26:01] reproduce themselves right okay so you
[26:06] don't just get you don't plant a vine
[26:08] and then you get one tomato that
[26:12] wouldn't be too profitable you wouldn't
[26:16] be sensible to sow your corn and you put
[26:19] out one grain of corn and you get one
[26:22] grain of corn back that's not too
[26:25] sensible you want it back in a multiple
[26:28] form to word that you can have something
[26:31] to eat but get this point now as we go
[26:34] along the rain that falls the scripture
[26:38] says about it it falls on the just and
[26:41] the unjust all right it's the same rain
[26:47] we've heard the Prophet tell the story
[26:49] over and over of how that that as its
[26:52] own the seed is sown upon the ground and
[26:54] and it comes forth but also here comes
[26:57] the weeds I didn't plant them
[27:02] did you ever planted any weeds you ever
[27:06] tried to transplant weed don't worry
[27:08] about it they're gonna be that just
[27:10] leave the ground alone they're gonna be
[27:13] there plenty of weeds gonna grow you
[27:16] don't have to plant them but somebody
[27:18] else does all right so that's what's
[27:21] happening now get this as we get to the
[27:25] point if we don't finish it today we'll
[27:26] finish this then later see think we
[27:29] talked about latter rain and we think
[27:33] about latter rain oh that's where people
[27:36] don't understand this what they'll say
[27:37] people don't understand ladder rain is
[27:39] only for the bride now where did you get
[27:43] that idea you certainly didn't get it
[27:47] out of the Bible you certainly never got
[27:50] it out of the prophets message
[27:53] because he said latter rain
[27:56] he said the latter rain will sweep the
[27:59] world that's why I've always told it
[28:05] I've always believed it I always look
[28:07] forward to it
[28:08] a revival but just remember how
[28:14] deceiving that revival is going to be
[28:18] because that harvest time is going to be
[28:22] for all kind see that's the point that
[28:30] we don't look at it I've always taught
[28:33] you to always believe the same rain our
[28:37] spirit our quickening that's quickening
[28:40] to you the truth of God's Word
[28:43] it does not quicken the lie no no it
[28:50] won't quicken a lot I don't get me wrong
[28:52] there so leave that out it won't quicken
[28:55] a lie
[28:55] it won't quicken the false line but
[28:58] that's the deception of where it's at
[29:00] it's the same rain that will fall on
[29:05] just and unjust and brings them to their
[29:08] crop right and finishes that part of the
[29:15] reproducing of itself coach I mean I'd
[29:19] like to say the more menu this quarter
[29:21] and cut that Oh morning glory or
[29:24] whatever down how do you garden and you
[29:26] said man I'm through with that on that
[29:29] round no problem with that one no no
[29:31] what about a week later you're gonna
[29:32] have another one growing right beside of
[29:34] it there's nothing else use your will
[29:37] the next year yeah but I cut that one
[29:39] down don't worry about it it'll be there
[29:43] all right what are you following my
[29:46] point now when we talk about former rain
[29:49] in the latter rain what do you think
[29:53] about all right you said what I think
[29:57] about the quickening of the word all
[29:59] right you're in the right position the
[30:01] right point but just remember the same
[30:04] rain that quickens our truth to you
[30:08] well also quicken gonna remember Satan
[30:16] cannot do it
[30:18] there's your deception there's your
[30:21] closeness is you got to get Satan has no
[30:24] ability to give life so let's get this
[30:31] thing straight before we even start
[30:33] through the message no matter how long
[30:35] it takes I'm pretty good at that anyway
[30:37] just I didn't have what about 40
[30:40] messages for the life service but all
[30:43] right what does it mean former rain and
[30:47] ladder right and remember the point is
[30:53] I'm getting no matter what it is it's
[30:57] the same rain the same rain that falls
[31:01] on your garden your beans potatoes
[31:05] tomatoes whatever you planted is the
[31:08] same rain that falls on the weeds and
[31:14] makes those weeds grow and reproduce
[31:22] what I like about it is that sometimes
[31:24] we find out them weeds is pretty good
[31:26] you know maybe uh maybe some of you
[31:30] ain't never ate some things like we have
[31:32] in a creases and poke sallet sand and
[31:36] all kind of things that others look at
[31:40] you in life I remember Terence one time
[31:42] he didn't like it because he ate some
[31:44] pokes at it and we'd all would have it
[31:47] every year a couple of times a year you
[31:49] know I wouldn't now but you know we just
[31:51] don't do it but we always had that folks
[31:52] out of it and you know Darren said I
[31:55] ain't eating that no more because he got
[31:57] an instant problem out of it and he
[32:01] didn't want no more pokes at it all
[32:04] right well but that didn't stop me from
[32:06] eating it that was just his problem some
[32:12] of those things we think are not too
[32:13] good to eat it might be pretty good all
[32:16] right but remember they have their place
[32:20] right that's the point they have their
[32:22] place but now get the point before we
[32:25] enter what we're trying to say we talked
[32:27] about rain but remember it's former rain
[32:31] in Latin right now former rain we're
[32:34] gonna get to it in a minute and call it
[32:35] planting rain but remember it's the seed
[32:43] that shows the rain to be true you plant
[32:51] your garden you put that seed in the
[32:54] ground if the moisture does not come to
[32:57] that seed it will not sprout forth I
[33:01] don't care how what you paid for it or
[33:04] what you call it you know it won't work
[33:09] it takes the moisture and the moisture
[33:13] is the holy spirit all right and being
[33:19] the being that it's the rain we look at
[33:24] the rain as the most importance and
[33:27] that's alright that's fine but just
[33:31] remember the seed is what you're
[33:34] planning you're not planning rain right
[33:39] you're not going out there planting rain
[33:42] it'll come until we know that this it's
[33:47] the same rain all the way through see
[33:49] whatever you pour a little bit old
[33:51] that's water that comes from heaven and
[33:54] brings down and wherever it comes from
[33:55] but it still the same rain and a week or
[33:58] two later you don't have to pour it
[34:00] unknown it one because it'll naturally
[34:03] rain all right so we don't do as the
[34:08] foreign fields that I've a little bit of
[34:10] check tone to it but in some places they
[34:14] have what they call former rains or
[34:16] style you know points and then it stays
[34:19] dry for quite a while and then it
[34:21] becomes and and the latter rain comes
[34:23] and produces all right we don't do that
[34:26] here if we did we dry out and die you
[34:30] know what we do here you got to have the
[34:32] planting part
[34:33] you got to get to plant up then you got
[34:36] to have rain continually throughout the
[34:39] growth development of that seed into
[34:42] granite to maturity then you come to the
[34:45] basis that we call it well that's that
[34:48] probably the life's rain will get but we
[34:50] really need a good rain a lot of times
[34:52] we get a good gush of rain you know and
[34:54] it'll finally produce your product and
[35:00] you certainly don't need no monsoon
[35:02] season but now if you're raised in wheat
[35:06] you see what I'm getting that is it's so
[35:09] hard to try to describe to people
[35:10] because your mind is in one way thinking
[35:12] another if you're raising wheat you want
[35:14] a lot of rain you know and in these
[35:19] foreign countries they have to punt it
[35:21] up put the water in on the time and the
[35:23] it grows up through all right but now
[35:27] get the point of what I'm saying the
[35:30] main thing is what is the seed you plant
[35:35] we talk about the rain great no matter
[35:41] what the seed is coming home one day and
[35:45] my wife we had built a house there and
[35:47] Gil's woman she we had a flower bed
[35:51] thing made and kind of a slope off and
[35:53] and he was all dug up and planted and
[35:57] you know and she said I've got us some
[36:00] vines to grow up here on the side of
[36:02] this thing to come up in and go over and
[36:06] I said you did yeah I said well why'd
[36:09] you get I don't know it's kind of a
[36:11] purple looking kind of seed and that
[36:13] triggered a little bit you know I said
[36:16] do you keep any of them she said yeah
[36:18] that little pack well on the pack I
[36:20] picked it up I I grabbed the whole one
[36:22] started digging you know why she had
[36:26] bought kudzu
[36:30] uh-huh she had bought kudzu it would
[36:34] grow over the house in the house and
[36:37] through the house it would take over the
[36:40] house right no it isn't hard to kill
[36:43] kudzu but to say she was trying to do
[36:46] what she thought was right she just got
[36:48] the wrong seed all right now that's the
[36:51] point see whatever now this is something
[36:56] that's gonna be hard for you to
[36:58] comprehend for a minute and I want to be
[37:01] slowing continual talk you you take seed
[37:08] and you plant them they're going to
[37:11] bring forth what ever the seed is right
[37:16] and and that's in the whole world all
[37:20] right but just remember it's the same
[37:23] rain weeds don't get a different rain
[37:30] it's the same rain but you said well why
[37:35] would God do that why would he allow
[37:41] those things and then we read like we
[37:46] did in in jaw and he talks about the
[37:50] cankerworm pond worm locusts and
[37:51] Caterpillar he says my great army that I
[37:57] sent among you
[37:58] well did God send the cankerworm upon
[38:01] warm locusts the caterpillar
[38:04] no he permitted it he didn't send it
[38:11] it's not his army it's that he permitted
[38:15] these things to take place you cannot
[38:18] make God guilty of doing wrong all right
[38:22] so he permits these things what two
[38:27] tries you have there in the scripture
[38:31] about incentive or profit you assign and
[38:33] it come to pies you're supposed to hear
[38:35] that profit right we believe that that
[38:38] scripture all right but there's another
[38:41] scripture the
[38:42] city for profit give a sign and it come
[38:45] to pies and he takes you to another God
[38:49] said don't hear him you know the rest of
[38:55] that scripture says because I have sent
[38:58] this among you to try you know but God
[39:05] that's and that's bad for you to you to
[39:09] send these things among us he wants his
[39:16] children to grow up and not stay babies
[39:22] he wants us to the basis that we can
[39:24] stand the pressure the troubles and the
[39:27] things all right so then thereby keep
[39:32] the point in mind there's only one rain
[39:35] you called it former you call it ladder
[39:38] you're just distinguishing whatever it
[39:42] is for the time right okay you just
[39:48] you're just talking about whether it's
[39:49] the early rain or latter rain or
[39:51] whatever it's not the rain it's the seed
[39:56] is the importance but rental most
[40:01] forward original seed he said see what
[40:04] kind of seed has been sown you mean God
[40:09] would permit these things to take place
[40:13] oh he's not a good god when he no you
[40:16] thinking about a dhoti old granddaddy
[40:18] you ain't thinking about a god or even a
[40:23] father that wants his children to grow
[40:26] up I've told you about it I we stout
[40:30] pictures on the wall of all the kids
[40:32] through their lives and I'm looking at
[40:34] that one day and I thought we you know
[40:35] there's a place for Anna there's a place
[40:38] for
[40:39] waiting Terrance they kind of stand out
[40:42] in your eyes and you think well it'd be
[40:45] nice if they stayed that away but you
[40:49] know I thought no that wouldn't be right
[40:51] as they were not brought into the world
[40:53] to state twelve years of age they were
[40:58] brought into the world to grow up and
[41:01] become children and then children adults
[41:03] and then start to reproductive process
[41:07] over to bring it to were you to have
[41:09] grandchildren great-grandchildren etc
[41:12] etc that's the purpose of reproduction
[41:16] alright and you don't want as I said I
[41:20] never did want my kids to act like the
[41:23] neighbor I didn't want him to do that I
[41:31] won't act like me you know what cuz I
[41:36] was her daddy no all right and see
[41:40] that's the way God wants his children so
[41:44] he never come into the world on the
[41:47] flowery bed of the east he never come
[41:52] into the world through this you know do
[41:57] all the living of life and it be a happy
[42:00] glorious thing he was a child then he
[42:05] was a teenager
[42:07] then he become an adult and before he
[42:11] finished his adulthood he had to die he
[42:17] knew the story of what it would be so
[42:22] what do you what are you getting that
[42:23] brother Dale I'm getting at one time we
[42:26] talk about former rain and latter rain
[42:28] and we claim oh yeah oh well we know
[42:31] what that is
[42:31] former rain is teaching right latter
[42:36] rain is rapture our harvest right but
[42:44] you're not listening
[42:48] you're not thinking according to Bible
[42:52] terminologies you're thinking according
[42:54] to your own concept and you have it
[42:57] labels that away then I come along and I
[43:02] jog you by saying things that sometimes
[43:05] you say well the Prophet didn't say it
[43:07] that way we'll check it out and see if
[43:09] he said it that way
[43:10] he didn't come tell me about it or the
[43:14] Bible doesn't say it that way that's
[43:15] what I asked you where can you go in the
[43:18] world and have a former rain and a lot
[43:21] of rain in one month and it produce your
[43:25] product those got to be saying something
[43:29] out right so what's it saying there is
[43:35] eventually going to come a quickening
[43:42] that will be real close together there's
[43:46] coming a planting of the seed water
[43:51] could belong to that planting and then a
[43:54] harvest of that seed that he's going to
[43:58] do a quick work and literally if you'll
[44:02] take the original where it says he'll do
[44:05] a quick work it literally says he'll do
[44:08] a quick word that's your literal
[44:11] translation you'll do a quick word wor D
[44:15] why because he's going for it incised
[44:20] because that's what he's promised we're
[44:26] the ones that caused it to drag out he's
[44:30] ready
[44:32] he was ready on Azusa Street to bring it
[44:36] forth that mankind wouldn't believe it
[44:39] and accept it when the Prophet walked on
[44:45] this earth he was ready to manifest and
[44:48] bring it all but who would accept it all
[44:56] right now the point I'm getting is what
[45:02] the most important thing is what seemed
[45:05] do you have now remember the quote that
[45:12] we keep giving where the Prophet said
[45:14] false prophets brain false verse true
[45:21] prophets he said brains troopers all
[45:25] right now meaning what you can take a
[45:36] doctrine and you produce it to people
[45:38] and they believe it and they glory in
[45:42] that and you'll see why
[45:44] see I've got right over in jaw a message
[45:47] that I've been able to preach
[45:48] I mean been aiming to preach for many
[45:51] many months but he's right on over in
[45:53] the book of Joel and seeing the very
[45:57] hour that we're living in the time
[46:00] because church we are in the last days
[46:04] science says it man says it we don't
[46:08] have to say it we just say what they say
[46:11] they're the scientists there are the
[46:14] people that says it's one minute till
[46:16] midnight you know they're the ones say
[46:20] in this world could be destroyed in any
[46:22] given second all right
[46:30] but what kind of seed do you have what
[46:36] good is a former rain if you're going to
[46:40] take the rain as the moisture to produce
[46:45] in order to start something to growing
[46:48] and the latter rain to be the moisture
[46:51] that will finish it up what good is it
[46:54] if you got the wrong seed we've glad to
[47:02] read to you the things that we have here
[47:04] of the property where he said the
[47:07] denominational seeds produces and
[47:09] denominations the bad dish produced
[47:16] Baptists the Methodists produce masters
[47:20] the brand of mites are produced in
[47:23] Brattle mines but the true word has
[47:26] struck the world everybody was
[47:29] emphasizing life's not a little bit
[47:30] about this another and I'm I do that
[47:32] I've tried or not and I wanted to say
[47:35] one thing you know the bride
[47:42] she cannot be deceived hindered yeah
[47:48] trouble yes but not deceived but it's
[47:54] only the bride that can't do that
[47:57] everything else will be deceived I've
[48:01] taught this from when I first come in
[48:03] the message I said you think that Adele
[48:06] come that God will anoint this church
[48:09] the bride what I said what's going to be
[48:12] the deceiving is is when He pours out in
[48:15] spirit it's gonna be on everything I've
[48:19] talked this from day one
[48:21] I said all these doctrines they've got a
[48:23] coup so two lords whatever do you
[48:25] realize when that spirit begins to fall
[48:28] they are going to be anointed also and
[48:33] they're going to rejoice and shout and
[48:36] say we've told you our doctrine was
[48:38] right like a brother said he was gonna
[48:42] kill this deer one time
[48:44] no and he said when I get that deer he
[48:46] said then you all know I was right well
[48:52] I thought the word was right it didn't
[48:56] matter what we killed a deer what we
[48:57] done you know I mean I thought it was
[49:00] the word I thought that was the point
[49:02] because there's only one word there's
[49:08] only one bride well you think you're
[49:11] doing a group I didn't say that I didn't
[49:16] say that I'll leave that up for you to
[49:17] think about how can they be so many
[49:21] different doctrines around the world
[49:22] from organized religions you know that
[49:26] each one says they're right and fighting
[49:29] each other how can they do that over one
[49:32] message or one God one Bible that was
[49:37] what bothered me in the Baptist Church I
[49:39] could see that that look at all of this
[49:42] around us everybody says they're right
[49:44] who's right you know what's the
[49:51] everybody says well we're right Lord you
[49:55] wait till the rain falls I say it's
[50:00] doing it now I'm not concerned with
[50:02] later I'm saying it's doing it now
[50:04] because you're seeing now everything
[50:05] coming to maturity you're seeing what
[50:08] all these denominations are doing and
[50:11] it's got real quiet really quiet going
[50:15] on but just don't worry about it's
[50:17] coming we see then you got the believers
[50:19] of the message you've got all of these
[50:21] pulling out and all of these things
[50:23] happening but one day when that spirit
[50:27] begins to fall though they're you sound
[50:30] like you're looking forward to a spirit
[50:33] moving I do because the Prophet said it
[50:37] I read them to either the other day
[50:40] after the door the Gentile churches
[50:42] closed God will ignore the church that
[50:45] I've always believed that do you believe
[50:48] that well I don't know whether he's
[50:50] right or not well then there's other
[50:52] things you won't believe he's right
[50:54] either well I don't look for a revival I
[50:59] got quotes where they ain't no revival
[51:00] the Prophet said there had never been a
[51:03] revival yet for the bride
[51:05] none of where a wide revival no no
[51:08] that's where you're wrong you're looking
[51:10] at it as a sweeping worldwide revival
[51:12] I'm not I'm looking at a gradual up
[51:15] crease upgrading and if you hadn't
[51:18] watched that go riding down the highways
[51:24] let me point out some things to you old
[51:28] brother or Willie Ross not a lot of he
[51:31] knew him and I admit I had the wrong
[51:35] thought in mind because he came up to
[51:38] church here and he said did I come up
[51:42] that 441 highway and he said riding
[51:46] right by them harlot houses and I
[51:50] thought no brother Willie I know where
[51:55] 441 comes to Athens there are a lot of
[51:58] you don't know but a lot of you that old
[52:00] enough you know where it used to run I
[52:02] don't know work still run that way
[52:04] when he used to run down by the river
[52:05] and come down the side and come out he
[52:09] didn't that big old bypass that you got
[52:11] find somebody that I don't find that and
[52:14] you know what was down by the river
[52:16] that was the red-light district of
[52:20] athens and I thought Willie how do you
[52:25] know about the red-light district he
[52:28] said them little old Hollett houses all
[52:30] along the way
[52:31] I didn't while he said you see them
[52:33] little old churches in with old
[52:35] denominations they little bad this here
[52:37] master see I was the one that was
[52:40] thinking wrong he was telling it right
[52:43] he told my churches little Hollett
[52:44] houses huh what you see Church what
[52:51] makes the difference between a a harlot
[52:54] and a true bride
[52:57] there's only one difference between a
[52:59] harlot matru Brian what is it
[53:03] one's got a husband one's got a husband
[53:10] what is our husband the true Word of God
[53:13] all right right okay come on
[53:18] then trying to get it out to you this
[53:20] for the point I'll lay this in and then
[53:22] I'll drop it off and pick it up in the
[53:24] next message
[53:27] don't forget the point I'm trying to
[53:30] make we talked about former rain and
[53:33] latter rain and you asked somebody said
[53:35] what is the form around the letter a'
[53:37] former Ryan is teaching rain brother
[53:39] Dale
[53:39] we got quote quote quote quote and
[53:41] what's the ladder right that's harvest
[53:43] rain or rapture in faith
[53:50] what about the rain falling on the just
[53:52] and the unjust how are you gonna be able
[53:59] to tell the difference well we don't get
[54:01] it that's what I said you go ride down
[54:04] these roads out here you go down through
[54:07] Athens buy them little harlot houses and
[54:09] you ever noticed this there's not a
[54:13] brand new Baptist Church nowhere that I
[54:16] know of
[54:19] now listen to what I'm saying
[54:22] you said well they existed oh no you
[54:25] ain't listening
[54:28] there's spoken word churches their
[54:32] evening life they talk about people in
[54:34] the message now I'm told I ride these
[54:37] roads and show me worse got a sign where
[54:39] our Baptist Church they don't they got
[54:42] an independent name now they don't have
[54:46] Baptists over the front of their
[54:48] churches you hadn't noticed that they
[54:51] don't have Methodists over their
[54:53] churches they don't have presbyterian
[54:56] they have evening light Tabernacles
[54:59] they have shallow they have all kind of
[55:05] names but none of them saying bad mr.
[55:09] Methodist you hadn't noticed that Opie
[55:12] eyes and look what are they doing
[55:16] they're trying to do what the Bible says
[55:18] they're trying to lay down everything
[55:20] because the Bible says what they have
[55:24] you Smith dismiss rip that's not God's
[55:26] name no way right come on they're right
[55:30] but what are they doing according to the
[55:35] Bible it says they've come a time that
[55:38] they'd be seven women to whatever man
[55:40] hotel you remember that much scripture
[55:42] and what did they say said to let us I'm
[55:48] paraphrasing it so I'm a little off with
[55:49] quoting it exactly I didn't mean to
[55:52] break it said let us be called by thy
[55:55] name to take away the reproach
[56:01] you go out and you start telling you say
[56:03] well you Baptists you master this you
[56:08] you which one was that killed John Smith
[56:11] was just a Methodist which one I was
[56:14] about to kill John Smith for his belief
[56:16] well he had a right to believe what he
[56:18] wanted to believe how do you like let us
[56:22] be called by thy name shall Oh evening
[56:25] not to have a neckl
[56:28] let us do away with our names and claim
[56:32] to be the name but what are y'all up
[56:34] there were spoken word Church
[56:38] well what y'all used to be because
[56:41] there's one down here spoken word Church
[56:43] he used to be a Baptist oh you wouldn't
[56:48] are you listening all of these things
[56:53] are coming to light life don't say it
[56:56] that way they're coming to life
[57:01] everybody's trying to become one that's
[57:05] the goal of every time I've talked you
[57:08] from day one I have never taught that
[57:12] the Baptist is gonna be done away with
[57:13] the method it's gonna be done away with
[57:15] the Pentecost is gonna be done away with
[57:17] and we're all gonna become world Church
[57:20] I've never told you nothing like that
[57:22] cuz I never believed it leave them
[57:26] Baptist leave a Methodist living there
[57:29] but I didn't really catch the point
[57:31] until just you know few years ago and I
[57:34] began to look they're doing away with
[57:37] their names they're volunteering their
[57:41] own names to be done away they're coming
[57:46] out to be just any kind of name you can
[57:51] think of instead of being Baptist
[57:54] because they don't want to be derogatory
[57:57] one to the other so we're all just got
[58:02] different names now you didn't talk
[58:05] about that
[58:05] you don't look around the world and pay
[58:08] attention to them
[58:11] let us be called by thy name to do away
[58:15] with our reproach you don't think like
[58:18] that he said well what do you think that
[58:22] mean I know what it means see what women
[58:26] do
[58:27] let let me marry you where I'll have you
[58:30] I'll do away with my maiden name take
[58:33] your name and that'll do away with my
[58:35] love approach though there's supposed to
[58:40] be a reproach for a young lady to have a
[58:44] bunch of babies and her not married I
[58:46] said it's supposed to be it was at one
[58:49] time let's see now if she's been married
[58:51] it's okay for her out ten or fifteen
[58:53] well cause he had us but no you get the
[58:58] point
[58:59] let us be called by thy name just let us
[59:02] be called Christians to do away with our
[59:06] reproach the church world is coming
[59:14] together but it's so sly it's so easy
[59:20] until it's deceiving the bride to sleep
[59:28] I was reading yesterday were when in
[59:30] fact this morning with a Beretta round
[59:32] and said we'd have to overcome soft
[59:34] living and riches that's true
[59:40] well let this thing tighten down a lot
[59:43] of my riches okay let me try to conclude
[59:47] the point
[59:52] to remember it is the same rain that
[59:59] falls on the just and the unjust well if
[1:00:04] God ain't serving no God that's that
[1:00:07] deceiving and he wants children that'll
[1:00:12] grow up to be children to not be
[1:00:15] deceived what is it the unveiling of God
[1:00:20] I believe a brother where he said the
[1:00:24] bride would prove that she's not like
[1:00:26] Eve well cuz she's gonna stay with the
[1:00:31] word what was Eve to see don't you want
[1:00:36] me to keep quoting run around him he
[1:00:38] said she's deceived on Hebrews 13:8 he
[1:00:42] realized that Eve was deceived on
[1:00:48] Hebrews 13:8 he didn't say she isn't
[1:00:51] this prostitute she is this that she was
[1:00:54] that over though that's where we get it
[1:00:56] wrong what was the seven demons that was
[1:01:00] cast out of Mary Magdalene not one of
[1:01:04] them is vulgar according to your prophet
[1:01:08] it's pride is boast it's stuff like that
[1:01:14] those are the demons we have to fight
[1:01:21] well I've been in the message longer
[1:01:24] than you there's all kind of life in
[1:01:26] yesterday cuz I guess around at that
[1:01:28] range at that time I said always
[1:01:30] probably one of them physically you know
[1:01:32] you know there was the whole life and
[1:01:35] how young they were well what does that
[1:01:39] matter what does it matter about it but
[1:01:45] are you listening that former rain and
[1:01:47] latter rain
[1:01:48] listen former rain and latter rain as in
[1:01:53] no way talking about the seed it's the
[1:02:00] quickening far the seed the quickening
[1:02:04] is the Holy Ghost you see but I don't
[1:02:08] get that brother Dale that you've
[1:02:09] confusing me you mean God would anoint
[1:02:12] them out there to do signs and wonders
[1:02:17] to deceive with according to the Bible
[1:02:22] and according to the prophet that's
[1:02:24] right his anointing his dark he loves
[1:02:32] music you think he don't love mutiny I
[1:02:38] don't think he loves this rocks nothing
[1:02:39] all that I don't know
[1:02:41] don't go off with the wrong direction I
[1:02:43] don't love nothing like that and I don't
[1:02:46] think he does either but he loves to be
[1:02:52] worshipped you know that he honors their
[1:02:56] priors
[1:03:01] am i true when sometimes seemingly he
[1:03:06] don't on our hours you ever thought that
[1:03:08] away somebody does that to tries to see
[1:03:12] what we're gonna do so if you don't get
[1:03:17] nothing out of the message today get one
[1:03:18] thing for certain our concept or
[1:03:22] thoughts about former and latter rain
[1:03:23] has always been to the basis of some
[1:03:26] kind of a of great outpouring and it is
[1:03:33] but remember before the rain falls on
[1:03:38] the seed the seed must be in the ground
[1:03:41] it's the importance is the seed that is
[1:03:44] planted not the rain the rain is going
[1:03:47] to fall I never walked out to a tomato
[1:03:55] plant with a gallon of water to pour the
[1:03:58] water on it and the plant look up and
[1:03:59] sell I don't want that I wanted to come
[1:04:01] out out of hell but that come out of the
[1:04:03] ground you said that's silly
[1:04:08] you know get one of me how are you gonna
[1:04:13] tell the difference we have the word
[1:04:22] well now there's about 5,000 different
[1:04:26] angles of the word in this message now
[1:04:28] what do we want remember the rain now
[1:04:41] listen the rain does not change the seed
[1:04:49] are you with me
[1:04:52] that's probably about as far as I can
[1:04:53] get so we'll just emphasize this and
[1:04:56] quit the rain don't change the seed
[1:05:01] that's why brother Branham said on
[1:05:03] Stewart's po-boy dress he said see how
[1:05:05] important it is the kind of words you
[1:05:09] preach or plant because remember
[1:05:14] whatever you plants gonna have a harvest
[1:05:18] two souls gonna have a harvest son of
[1:05:21] virtue have a harvest peru's is all
[1:05:23] these doctrines in the message they're
[1:05:25] gonna have a harvest to him I thought
[1:05:29] I've ever tried to warn you you said
[1:05:32] well brother then we got no message
[1:05:34] ringing - so I preached on the soul
[1:05:36] years ago and some come and said I tell
[1:05:38] you what maybe I was maybe held leaning
[1:05:40] kind of ward that well you know that's
[1:05:42] my job
[1:05:45] well bless God I don't believe that what
[1:05:48] you believe
[1:05:48] well I think I come here with this seed
[1:05:50] in me I like what the brother said
[1:05:52] yesterday is a good point
[1:05:56] what do you say germ or what do you call
[1:05:58] it they call it a germ we're calling it
[1:06:00] no word all say the word seed coat it's
[1:06:02] the same thing jerem he said don't
[1:06:04] matter ask you to how a germ you've got
[1:06:07] to have the moisture you gotta have the
[1:06:11] Holy Spirit you say you come here with
[1:06:13] this gene in you you gotta have the Holy
[1:06:16] Spirit to make that alive or you don't
[1:06:20] have a new burner
[1:06:21] oh I come here with eternal life show me
[1:06:24] that in the message well I got this
[1:06:27] quote come on bring the quote because
[1:06:30] see you're not reading right up above
[1:06:32] there where the Prophet said if you have
[1:06:35] eternal
[1:06:36] then you always was eternal so we don't
[1:06:42] matter as much about the rain now you
[1:06:49] listening the latter rain can be falling
[1:06:53] all over the place to bring the corn to
[1:06:59] the harvest but you know what it's doing
[1:07:02] it's bringing up a lot of weeds because
[1:07:05] why it's the form of rain to that weed
[1:07:08] seed
[1:07:09] it ain't a ladder rain cuz of Dayna
[1:07:11] harvest you can't tell the difference
[1:07:13] what I'm getting out you go out there
[1:07:16] and you get red and you say well we need
[1:07:18] one more rain those farmers know what
[1:07:21] that means we need if we just get one
[1:07:24] more rain it will produce but you know
[1:07:29] what it does it's the latter rain to the
[1:07:32] corn it's a form of rain to the weed all
[1:07:38] the same rain this dank plain sensible
[1:07:45] the point I'm trying to get at is what
[1:07:48] we're the most important is the word
[1:07:49] that we hear you said a Holy Ghost angle
[1:07:55] and quick and false word no it won't
[1:07:57] quicken falsework but it can quicken the
[1:07:59] individual and that individual can
[1:08:02] believe yes but you're saying that the
[1:08:09] Holy Ghost will quicken that's exactly
[1:08:12] right so it determines whether or not
[1:08:16] you know where you're standing there
[1:08:21] like I said I could have left that kudzu
[1:08:25] growing out there on the thing you know
[1:08:27] and we'd have had our house covered over
[1:08:29] kudzu but I knew what's he planted and I
[1:08:36] won't know how many seeds he put in the
[1:08:38] ground I wanted to dig him up and I
[1:08:40] looked the other day and I ain't kidding
[1:08:42] you
[1:08:42] that was what 50 years ago how long's
[1:08:44] that been I looked at I was up there the
[1:08:47] other day at my brother's house which
[1:08:49] was the house we built 65 and you know
[1:08:53] what I was looking at there's still that
[1:08:55] same flowerbed was not a thing in the
[1:08:57] world growing in it we didn't get nothin
[1:09:00] planted in it and nobody else never
[1:09:02] planted nothing in that flowerbed it
[1:09:04] still sitting there but there was that
[1:09:07] sloped off and I look down up there I
[1:09:10] dug that thing clean cuz ain't nothin
[1:09:13] grow it you know listen Church I think
[1:09:18] it's time what are you saying I think
[1:09:19] it's time to start growing out a few
[1:09:21] stones getting rid of some of our ideas
[1:09:25] and some of our thoughts why because
[1:09:32] we've had 50 years and what we've done
[1:09:34] and we stayed with the truth looking at
[1:09:37] 50 years look what's happening now the
[1:09:43] devil's going on vacation you don't need
[1:09:47] to be around the more eat on vacation
[1:09:50] you hey you're receiving well that's
[1:09:52] true
[1:09:53] he's on vacation you know what God we're
[1:09:56] the one that's doing it they were
[1:10:02] fighting with each other when they were
[1:10:03] fighting around horrible and one day
[1:10:06] they said look quit fighting let's go
[1:10:10] you know what they wound up in the
[1:10:12] promised land for 40 years they thought
[1:10:16] around order
[1:10:17] arguing over doctrines write multitudes
[1:10:25] multitudes in the valley of decision
[1:10:31] I'll preach that when I get done
[1:10:35] multitudes multitudes in the valley of
[1:10:38] decision but scripture says
[1:10:43] you look at the people now and they
[1:10:45] can't decide what this doctor is right
[1:10:47] of that doctor they just move into the
[1:10:48] house the house and they're gonna go
[1:10:50] over this group look Oh Lord glory I I
[1:10:52] believe this in the end uh well hey I
[1:10:55] did remember I think I'd be enough okay
[1:10:59] yep hey wait I don't know where he gave
[1:11:04] up our cloth to somebody at the
[1:11:06] dentist's office but you know what they
[1:11:09] wound up doing he went back and they
[1:11:11] told him I wonder there's more he took
[1:11:13] what 20 20 prayer calls to the dentist
[1:11:17] and gave it to the girl she went down
[1:11:20] through the building passing out prayer
[1:11:21] cloth come back had one and she held out
[1:11:24] in the spread and said we'd like to have
[1:11:26] liked so we're gonna just cook them up a
[1:11:28] bunch of our car welco they believed it
[1:11:35] now listen Church I'm not throwing those
[1:11:38] stones or no I'm saying there's good
[1:11:40] people out there and there are the only
[1:11:44] difference between them and me and you
[1:11:46] is God in us you say they don't believe
[1:11:53] the word they might believe it more than
[1:11:57] you think if you try to talk to them if
[1:12:06] you don't get nothing out of the message
[1:12:07] today remember one time former and
[1:12:09] latter rain is not talking about what
[1:12:12] you think is talking about former and
[1:12:14] latter rain is talking about the
[1:12:16] quickening it's it's called later we'll
[1:12:19] get to it it's called a planting rain
[1:12:21] and a harvest rain but remember it
[1:12:26] doesn't change the seed it doesn't
[1:12:33] change anything except producing the
[1:12:37] crop he said well brother I've heard you
[1:12:43] say you're looking for a revival the
[1:12:44] Prophet said it a seal book he said it
[1:12:47] take him seven known thunder Specter the
[1:12:49] wake arrived I believe that not a world
[1:12:54] wide sweeping revival no never
[1:12:56] I believed it that way but I didn't know
[1:12:57] about it start with probably said the
[1:13:00] life worldwide for even revival was the
[1:13:02] zoo the street let's see
[1:13:13] what about a revival in your heart I
[1:13:16] thought a revival was supposed to be
[1:13:18] individuals I didn't know it was a group
[1:13:22] I thought it was individuals that had a
[1:13:25] revival in their heart to make up what
[1:13:27] was the old policeman standing there
[1:13:28] when the man asking said where's the
[1:13:30] Welsh revival
[1:13:31] he said you're looking at it but you see
[1:13:40] what I'm getting at former rain and
[1:13:43] latter rain has to do with the rain
[1:13:45] that's put up on the seed he's got to be
[1:13:49] the right seed run around with my word
[1:13:54] original seed I remember that one real
[1:13:56] well you told me the Baptist is soda
[1:13:59] messages so Billy grocer he said in the
[1:14:02] word has been sown pure and
[1:14:04] unadulterated from all denominational
[1:14:08] ideas that's what he said
[1:14:13] didn't he turn right around in that same
[1:14:16] point and said as of yet not like a fool
[1:14:19] he's not fulfilled then you can see
[1:14:24] where I'm headed so we'll give you a
[1:14:26] thought I'm headed to the point that I
[1:14:28] ended the point on the other message
[1:14:31] little Ron's message begun with the
[1:14:35] opening of the seals and that's his
[1:14:38] message from there on out that he was to
[1:14:40] bring see I'm not ending that message
[1:14:47] I'm just changing the title I've done
[1:14:51] that for 40 years I might as well keep
[1:14:53] on doing it
[1:14:54] he said well brother there you preach
[1:14:56] that sunrise yeah five years ago I just
[1:15:01] keep cycling to beginning come on
