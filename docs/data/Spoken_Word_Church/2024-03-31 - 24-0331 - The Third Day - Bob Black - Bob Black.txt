TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen God bless you Saints and happy Resurrection Day and that's what I I we we'll do a little out of band uh Sunday school lesson today and I want to talk about the resurrection you think about um that everything everything we're doing and everything we're standing for and uh our whole life is based on what what happened uh on that on that Resurrection morning when Jesus came forth from the the grave to prove to prove that he could if he could do it for one he could do it for all of us so let's let's just go the Lord in prayer before we read this little scripture in in Mark chapter 8 Lord God we we're so grateful Lord for all that you've done for us Lord and for the privilege to be able to gather around your word today I pray God that you'll just be with us today as we study these things out and just kind of go through these scriptures be with brother Tim Lord as he's preparing Lord Jesus prepare our hearts Lord God to receive what you have in store for us Lord we just ask your blessing upon the service now your name so Mark 8 uh: 31 says and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and scribes and be killed and after three days rise again and he spake that saying openly and Peter took him and began to rebuke him but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples he rebuked Peter saying get thee behind me Satan for thou savest not the things that be of God but the things that be of men are you think about Peter didn't quite understand what Jesus's purpose was and uh he he he was stumbling at that and you know really if we want to understand the will and purpose of our life and the purpose of all these things if you get into the into the word like brother Tim was saying yesterday that his word is his will and his word is like a road road map for our life and and uh the road map for Jesus's life was he was going to have to die to die for us to die for our sins and go to that cross and go through all the things that that were represented in that Journey but I I I want to kind of focus this morning on looking at the third day because there's there's so many thing that the third day is is uh so many types in the Old Testament that were pointing to that third day so many things that we can even look at today through the life of brother brandom and the Miracles that happened in his life and things that that were reflections of that third day and so many so many miracles that brother Brown talked about that that happened on that third day because there's there's something something tied in with that the third day is is is perfection and completeness and and life and that number three reflected all through scripture you think about what happened on the third day that 1 2 three Jesus died on that on that Friday afternoon he was in the grave and then he come up on Resurrection morning and the scripture says in Matthew chapter 16 from that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go into Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day and Matthew chapter 17 says they shall kill him in the third day so many scriptures maybe we won't go through each one of these in detail but um the third day he shall rise again in Luke chapter 9 he be raised the third day and over again it talks about the third day the third what was that third day is the ultimate fulfillment of Divine Purpose the demonstration of God's power over death that on that third day you could see and like brother brother Tim was saying how do how do we know that that happened how do we know there's there's uh many historians that you can look at Josephus and tacitus and all those that wrote about the life of Jesus but those are these like like Peter said uh he said you know I was up there on the mount Transfiguration when I when I I I saw you know I heard the voice from Heaven speaking to to say hear ye him to Jesus but I've got a more sure word of Prophecy the days star that shines in our heart that you actually sitting here today with the pillar of fire in your heart that same Pillar of Fire are the testimony that these things are true you are the Vindication that these things are true and we a testimony that the same power that rose up Christ from the grave could change your life and change your thoughts and change your change your being so that you could be a witness you are a witness that these things are true amen the third day now three is the number of life and these are quotes that brother R said three is the number of life life and God chose three he said in another place and three is God's number of perfection and he said in another place when the little baby Christ was born three stars went together and made the one morning star that reflected the coming of an infant Christ a perfect one three showing what it was a testifying three show testifying that life was coming that life was coming to the world to die for us that you you and I could have that same life you you think when when when God uh when he created the world and began to take the the chaos of the world and and put order to it and begin to uh on that third day when he he spoke and life began to spring up grass and trees and all those things that he he so uh on that third day it was meant so much to God that He gave it a double blessing as we'll read in Genesis 1: 10 he said and God saw that it was good and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding forth fruit after his kind and the Earth brought forth grass and Herb yelding seed and and again he said and God saw that it was good so that on the third day there was a double blessing giving now you you we're just kind of run through all these Third Day Third Day types in the Bible a Jewish wedding is is is usually held on the third day many Jewish couples choose to have their wedding on a Tuesday which is considered a favor favorable day for weddings in Jewish tradition in this case the wedding would take place on the third day of the week counting from Sunday so Sunday Monday not not all Jewish weddings are on Tuesday but most a lot of the time they want to have it on Tuesday and even there in John Chapter 2 it says the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee and the mother of Jesus was there now you think about you think about how the third day today's the third day from Friday that the The Good Friday when when Christ went into the ground but any day really could be your third day maybe maybe you you been Justified and you've been Sanctified and then you come to a place where you really really ready to open up your heart and you the words been packed in and you've been holding the word and this today could be your third day uh any day could be like Tuesday might be the third day of the Jewish wedding maybe maybe you go home and you begin to really meditate on the word of God and through the week and you're riding in your car and you're thinking about things and the word just been building up and and culminating until you just finally cut loose and the the the spirit of God comes in car or in your shower in the morning or by your bed at night and oh there you got your third day what what's the third day the third day is when life comes the third day is when God fulfills his promise to you and shows that he's got power over death hell and the grave and and delivers you from all the maybe all the Mind battles and things like that you think about uh when Abraham and Isaac were walking up that mountain it was on the third day when Abraham looked and he saw he saw the place where he was going to take have to take his son to be sacrificed and it was the third day when Isaac spoke to his father and said My Father Here I am I but where where is the Lamb for a burnt offering and Abraham was he was going to he was going to kill his only son but God had a sacrifice prepared now that see how that all types back to Christ that we needed a sacrifice we needed a lamb and God he steal Jehovah Gyra he provided he provided us a lamb on the cross on the third day that he rose from the grave he was the lamb that God provided now you remember remember this was the same thing that had Wright was saying that ain't nothing the truth to because brother R was telling that story of he's still the same Jehovah Gyra today taking that back he's still the same Jehovah Gyra he's still the same Jehovah Gyra that can that that will that will provide provide every promise that he's given to us amen it was the third day when they were coming up to the River Jordan and and God told Joshua he said pass through the host and command the people prepare you victuals for within 3 days shall pass over this Jordan to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it and in Joshua 3:2 it say and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host so it was the third day when they were following the word Over the River Jordan and the water parted and they went over over the over the water it was the third day when Esther came before The King and it came to pass in Esther chapter 5 it says and it came to pass on the third day after Esther had been fasting and praying and she got all of her maids and everybody to to fast and pray with her and fast and prayed but on the third day she stood before the king that Esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner Court of the King's house over against the King's house and the King sat upon his Royal throne in the Royal house over against the Gate of the house and what are all these things thinking of they're all types of the third day when Christ Rose from the grave the third day to give you a third day that you'll come through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the full word where God can can raise you from your from out of dead domination and out of your old carnal ideas and raise you up into Victory through the power of the same power that raised him up from the grave it was three days after they had been wandered in the wilderness without without water in Exodus chapter 15 it says they went three days in the wilderness and God brought them to the bitter Waters and they how they were one how are we going to drink from this and Moses cried un the Lord and God showed him a tree throw that tree into the water and he took on the third day the bitter Waters became pure so they could drink it and it was three days that Jonah was in the belly of the Well I this might not be a you know it's it's a strange picture here but you you think about what a horrible thing that would have been for Jonah to be swallowed up in a whale and brother Ram said that God gave him oxygen he gave him oxygen in that belly of the whale to keep him alive down in that belly of well a typee something that Jesus could refer back to and say that as Jonah was in the belly of the well for 3 days so must the son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and it was on the third day when the word the children of Israel gathered around Mount Si and and and Moses was going to go up and bring the Tabernacles the the the the stones uh the The Ten Commandments down to them and God was going to align everything so that they could have the the word in Exodus chapter Exodus 19 it says be ready against the third day for the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon Mount SII and it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there were Thunders and Lightnings and a thick Cloud upon the mount and it was the third day it was a third day when when uh David was going to be was going to ascend to be king because it said in 2 Samuel chapter 2 it came to pass even on the third day that Behold a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent and Earth upon his head and so it was when he came to David that he fell to the Earth and did obes it was the third day when that amalaki ran out and you remember the whole story that that uh David found out that he had that amalaki had he said I'm an amalaki and I I saw that Saul was slain in battle so I took it upon myself to go ahead and finish the job and David got so upset with him he's like you don't touch two days and the third day he will revive us again and give us light in his sight life in his sight there is your trumpets coming in so if you want to kind of map that out 780 BC another thousand years will be 221 ad another thousand years will be 1221 ad and we're right here in that third day 28284 years when the prophecy of Hosea said in the third day he will raise us up what that same power that raised up Christ from the grave would come back to restore our faith back to the original faith of the Pentecostal fathers here right here in the third day now you know as brother Tim was preaching yesterday and and brother Solomon was laying out there was when Jesus rose from the grave the morning of the third day there was a rumor went out is he really risen and in Luke chapter 24 it says it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and other women that women that were with him which told these things unto the apostles and their words seemed to them as Idle tales and they believed them not they're going around telling everybody that I I I know that he's risen but they wouldn't believe him it was just a rumor that went out it was a third day rumor but brother said and Jesus had been crucified and dead buried a rumor had been he had raised again and he walked with them all day and they didn't know him he's talking about on the way to EMAs thinking about Jesus walking with the two dis disciples and they didn't know who he was he has walked with many people they didn't know it that's who kept him from having that wreck coming over here that's what heals your baby Christ and maybe you didn't recognize it but now on the evening of the third day the evening of the third day isn't that a wonderful type in the evening time it was a it's it in Luke chap 24 verse 39 but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went into to ter with them and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break and gave to them and their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures and Luke chapter 24 keep reading on and they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found the 11 gathered together and them that were with him saying the Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in Breaking of bread and as they thus spake Jesus himself to stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you so it was in the evening time when they began to recognize that Christ had really risen now we've heard a message in this day to bring to our to our understanding that Christ is indeed risen you you know if you follow all these miraculous things that happened in brother R brother brother Ram's life you'll find Miracle after miracle that happened on the third day even even that picture that they took that the critics took the picture of the pillar fire there in Houston Coliseum they actually they meditated on George Lacy brother R said they they went and they meditated on it for a couple of days but it was on the third day when they came forth and they said they made that the the the statement brethen brandom one of these days you're going to pass off of life scen like all Mortals do he said I I'm aware of that sir but as long as there's a Christian civilization your picture shall never die and that picture he said you'll know about it on at 2:00 on the following afternoon on the third day it was the third day brother R when he was telling all these experiences he said there was a little girl laying kind of stooped over he said I laid my hands on her now father to the father do you and mother promise to serve God testify wherever you go about it we will I said' don't fear I have a word for you and and he goes on he said I walked out of the building and on the third day the child returned to school it was healed well so many miracles and things that were comparing to this third day there's another example of um this uh this little boy that had pneumonia and his brother had already died of pneumonia and brother brandham prayed for he God showed him a vision and he he prayed for the the the little child and um and you know if you go back and look at the story uh he was he was supposed to wait for the mama to be in the room but he went ahead and prayed and and he and and nothing happened and he realized well it's not according to the vision and so nothing happened and he he waited and he stayed and he kept praying until finally God told him uh what to do next and he he called the Dad over and he said do you still have confidence in me and and he prayed for him and he and and he began to get well and and brother brand relays the story he said now in three days three days he's going to come he's going to walk across the floor to me and he's going to put his little hands in mine and say brother brandom I'm perfectly whole and the whole church he told the whole church and they had such confidence in that they they all parked their cars outside of the house and they they got they were ready to go into the house and see God's word be fulfilled on that third day on the third day the whole church was there to see that little boy walk across the floor and say brother brandom I'm perfectly whole on the third day and what are all these things speaking of Christ Rose from the grave on the third day and the testimony brother BR said about 3 months after that he's telling another testimony he said I happen to see somebody back there waving and I didn't know who it was sitting right out like that and they was waving at me and it was the woman sitting there she said don't you recognize me brother Brown I said no I don't she said the last time you see me they told me that I was bleeding all over and I was out of my head and he took the woman back had no trouble taking her back she set up and the second day when she was in the in institution I said let them dismiss her so the second day they come to her and she was sitting up the third day they give her a discharge from the place send her home in her right mind on the third day and brother Brown said in the restoration of the brid tree he said it is Easter again for the True Believers of his never failing word it's Easter it's a resurrection God has got people everywhere it's Easter for them why they have risen from risen from those Creeds and denomination come right up through them it's Easter again the Royal seed has been hid in The Roots the word hid back here in this word for years and years and years and just now begin to be revealed it's Easter time predestinated from the foundation of the world this church is begin to stand notice how that God predestinated in in the beginning he said notice here that to restore the first Perfect Tree in 3 days after its death after the first tree's death He restored it in three days restored it back now the bride tree is also going to be restored in Three Ages three stages rather three stages it'll be restored justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost 1 2 3 after 3 days the first tree restored as at the beginning having the same signs same wonders Jesus come back the same Jesus doing the same thing at the end of the third day the signs appeared not at the end of the first day oh oh brother I hope you're getting it at the third day is when the real manifestation of Christ was made known at the end of the third day he said again in the resurrection of restoration of the Bride tree he said now here in the last day here he is right among us moving right among us at the end of the third day he appeared and showed all them his resurrection sign that he was a living the same yesterday today and forever living fruits of his presence living fruits of his presence are you getting it was manifested at the very end of the day when he appeared to all of them his church they all got together at the end of the third day he said again and God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief and we rebuke Satan and all of his powers of Darkness all of his powers of unbelief the spirit of God has raised up a standard against you Satan you are a defeated being Jesus Christ defeated you at Calvary he raised up the third day triumph over death hell and the grave
