[23:44] glad to be in the house of the lord
[23:47] amen praise god
[23:58] i'm trusting god that we have a good
[24:01] time
[24:02] in the world this weekend
[24:05] but whether or not i'm just here for a
[24:06] short time
[24:08] and i'm gone
[24:10] and so i'll leave you all with it
[24:12] amen
[24:14] praise god just
[24:18] thank god for the wonderful fellowship
[24:21] you put on the inside it's going to be
[24:23] on the outs inside
[24:28] amen
[24:31] amen
[24:32] we we certainly thank god for
[24:35] this ministry in particular
[24:38] and um i've always said i
[24:41] thank god for the men of god who have
[24:43] really labored with the word of god and
[24:46] to feed the flock of god
[24:48] um we
[24:50] really don't have a lot of teachers
[24:52] around the message
[24:53] and those that we have they are fading
[24:56] away
[24:57] and the whole timers are fading away and
[25:00] those that who are
[25:01] there with the prophet and has testimony
[25:04] personal testimonies of the things that
[25:05] they've seen and heard you know it's
[25:07] going
[25:08] and so so we're we're moving
[25:11] like in another dispensation really
[25:14] people who we're standing there because
[25:16] we believe
[25:18] you know we weren't there we can't talk
[25:19] about being in the meetings because
[25:21] we're never in the meetings but i think
[25:23] there's a greater legacy
[25:25] in accepting the word of god amen there
[25:29] really and uh i i know there's people
[25:32] you find sometimes that they just want
[25:34] to find i remember their brother was
[25:36] with me from south africa and he just
[25:39] wanted to be with brother brady you just
[25:41] want to hear one more time one more time
[25:44] amen praise god but but you know i mean
[25:47] that that is all good
[25:49] that that is all good but but that's not
[25:52] what the message really is
[25:54] you know it's christ in you the hope of
[25:56] glory
[25:57] amen
[25:58] and and there's something that each one
[26:00] of us must have that is personal
[26:03] personal i'm not there because my father
[26:06] because my mom because my family you
[26:08] know this is a family heritage you know
[26:10] no i'm there because god personally by
[26:12] his grace has called me
[26:14] and um so i am holding on to this
[26:18] because of him
[26:19] amen praise god so we want to turn our
[26:21] bibles to uh
[26:23] john 5
[26:24] 24 25 we're going to read then we're
[26:26] going to read from the book of zechariah
[26:28] chapter 14
[26:30] verse 6.
[26:31] amen i'd like to speak a sibling on a
[26:34] personal
[26:35] resurrection
[26:37] amen
[26:38] hallelujah a personal resurrection he's
[26:41] got to be risen in you
[26:43] amen praise god
[26:45] and you know i've always thought that
[26:47] the way we
[26:48] celebrate our birth days
[26:50] you know there's a greater birth when
[26:52] you were born again
[26:54] you know that um
[26:55] we as christians sometimes i was
[26:57] thinking that we ought to forget that
[26:59] day that our mama gave birth to us and
[27:02] start to celebrate the day when we were
[27:04] born again
[27:05] if you're really born again
[27:07] because if you're born again you you
[27:09] can't have a birth and you don't know it
[27:12] so you know um you've got to know so
[27:15] that's what we ought to celebrate
[27:17] amen so let us just bow our heads as we
[27:19] go to the word
[27:21] our great god and father i want to thank
[27:23] you god for this evening that oh god

[27:48] you this evening the lord god as we
[27:50] search our own hearts and look at the
[27:52] things that are ahead of us oh god lord

[27:57] energize us oh god and we keep our
[27:59] attention bless us god and we we're so
[28:02] sorry sometimes lord we go overboard and
[28:04] we do things all over you know you out
[28:07] of your experience but lord god we thank
[28:09] you for being a gracious god to us and
[28:12] lord that's the reason why we stand

[28:35] and believeth on him that sent me hath
[28:38] everlasting life and shall not come into

[29:00] verse 6 and 7 i will read
[29:03] and it shall come to pass in that day
[29:06] that the light shall not be clear nor

[29:57] at the evening time amen
[30:01] and you know we look at the world today
[30:02] and everything is coming to
[30:04] its climax
[30:06] you know we we sing and sometimes we
[30:08] wonder nations are breaking israel
[30:11] awaking the sign of the prophets
[30:13] foretold the gentiles this number
[30:17] you know sometimes it's easy to think
[30:19] that we're going to continue like this
[30:20] all the days of our lives
[30:23] but you know we can look back when when
[30:26] kovitz truck
[30:27] you know i remember
[30:29] i was on the airplane on my way to east
[30:31] africa when i first heard about kovy
[30:34] this this thing in china
[30:36] and you know i was just listening and
[30:38] and wondering really and by the time i
[30:41] get back it's sweep the entire earth
[30:44] and you know things that we we never
[30:47] thought that we would have seen i
[30:49] remember when our country shut down and
[30:52] when i said it was shot down it was shut
[30:55] down
[30:55] you know i had to go out really as a
[30:58] central service and you know the sound
[31:00] was going through my mind the
[31:02] marketplace is empty no more
[31:04] uh no
[31:06] the marketplace is empty no more
[31:09] uh something in the street the builders
[31:11] tools are silent no more time to harvest
[31:14] reap
[31:15] busy housewives sees their labor in the
[31:18] courtroom no debate
[31:20] time on earth is all suspended as a king
[31:23] come through the gate and it really felt
[31:25] like that there was just nothing going
[31:27] on everything was shut down and you
[31:29] couldn't believe it nobody could tell
[31:31] that something like that could happen
[31:33] but you know these things this is just a
[31:35] dressing room
[31:37] you know and he's just showing us what
[31:39] can happen
[31:41] in the twinkling of an eye
[31:43] you know something that started just at
[31:46] a little spot might be in the earth and
[31:48] it sweep the entire earth
[31:52] and you know that's the way the word of
[31:54] god moves that's the way god does his
[31:56] thing you know we used to say it's
[31:59] moving just like a magnet
[32:01] moving here moving air
[32:03] moving all over the atmosphere the holy
[32:06] ghost power is moving
[32:08] just like a magnet
[32:10] but you know the evening time
[32:12] we're we're under expectation for that
[32:15] time but we can say that time is here
[32:18] when it's not the morning when we can
[32:21] slack up and you know just goof off a
[32:24] little bit and you know get complacent
[32:26] but this is a time where something is
[32:28] required at your ends
[32:31] it is time to wake up and realize
[32:35] that god is moving
[32:37] by his spirit
[32:39] hallelujah
[32:40] and for the church hallelujah in the
[32:43] messages rising of the sun

[39:56] of us were hiddens
[39:58] hallelujah
[40:00] but they've come to see this great light
[40:03] you know i've traveled africa
[40:05] and and i've realized that you know the
[40:08] the traditional belief of the people is
[40:11] ancestral worship
[40:13] and so they've never been converted to
[40:15] anything what they believe is ancestral
[40:18] worship
[40:19] and with ancestral worship is witchcraft
[40:23] because that's the highlight of their
[40:24] ancestral worship
[40:26] you know i remember being in nigeria you
[40:28] know in in the hotel room and looking
[40:30] across
[40:31] and seeing the people right at their
[40:33] their gate and they're they're they're
[40:35] doing their their little thing really
[40:37] and the fire come up and they make their
[40:39] sacrifice and and all of that really i
[40:42] said my god
[40:43] if they could only know jesus christ
[40:47] hallelujah but there are times also that
[40:50] we've got a challenge
[40:52] hallelujah witchcraft
[40:54] i remember i was traveling hallelujah
[40:57] you you know kampala and you know i
[40:59] noticed the fruit vendors at the end of
[41:01] the day they
[41:02] they seem to walk away and leave their
[41:04] fruits right there you know it's not
[41:06] covered it's it's just right so i said
[41:08] to the brother why is it they leave it
[41:10] just like that then he said brother
[41:12] keith he said they believe in witchcraft
[41:15] and they practice witchcraft
[41:17] and you dare not touch their produce
[41:20] or else you're going to pay
[41:22] and i said man
[41:24] and we put locks on our doors
[41:26] is that right who are christians but
[41:29] they it's witchcraft
[41:31] and if somebody take it then they said
[41:33] they've got to pay
[41:35] hallelujah i said man i know my god is
[41:39] bigger than that
[41:43] i remember
[41:45] that they're taking me to bosnia
[41:48] it's right on the border between
[41:50] uganda and kenya in other words you
[41:52] could just walk across and you're in
[41:54] kenya and you step back and you're in
[41:56] uganda so it's right on the border
[41:59] and so you know the brother said oh
[42:02] there's a girl that i would love you for
[42:04] you to pray for
[42:05] i said okay i'm i'm his guest so
[42:07] wherever i go i go and you know he took
[42:09] me through the houses there's there's no
[42:12] property boundary that's what they just
[42:14] put a hose where there's a vacant spot
[42:16] and and so we walked through this house
[42:18] israel and i was wondering i wonder if
[42:20] he knows where he's going
[42:22] because because you know you're going
[42:23] through like a maze
[42:25] but i remember it it take me to this
[42:27] place and you know i when there was two
[42:29] little girls on the outside and they
[42:31] they had like a cold pot and they had
[42:33] pieces of meat and like they were
[42:36] roasting it looks like goat or something
[42:37] like that they were roasting it on the
[42:39] fire and i was just thinking that maybe
[42:42] you know just kids playing
[42:44] you know and so but we we parted this
[42:46] curtain and we we went and as soon as i
[42:48] stepped at the door i could hear the
[42:50] groan
[42:52] you know like that that deep goblin
[42:54] ground you know and i look across and
[42:56] it's a little girl
[42:58] she was lying in a couch and
[43:00] you know covered to her face and you
[43:03] know she was awesome
[43:04] and groaning really
[43:06] and so you know the brother comes in and
[43:09] they begin to explain to me that she
[43:11] belongs to a relative
[43:13] of a family that is in the message
[43:17] and they begin to tell me you know um
[43:19] two weeks ago
[43:20] or or older sister die
[43:23] and as soon as the sister died she said
[43:25] that the demons tell her
[43:27] that she's going to be next
[43:29] and immediately they buried her sister
[43:32] she got sick
[43:33] and this was about two weeks after you
[43:36] know she was lying there so they they
[43:38] took her they were edens the family's
[43:40] eden and so they took her to these
[43:43] believers house and and they leave her
[43:45] there
[43:46] and you know i was listening through the
[43:48] interpretation it had to be two
[43:50] interpreters really
[43:52] and so i was listening but you know
[43:54] seeing that girl i said oh old is she he
[43:56] said she's 15 years old and i felt that
[43:59] compassion
[44:00] so i i step across and you know i went
[44:03] and i sit on her bed and i put my hands
[44:06] on her forehead she was running a fever
[44:08] as a lord jesus
[44:11] if you were here you would have raised
[44:14] this child
[44:15] and this child would not have died
[44:17] lord in the name of jesus
[44:19] rise this child from this sickness
[44:22] and brothers
[44:23] that little girl the the groaning stop
[44:28] and she opened her eyes
[44:30] and she turned around and she sit up she
[44:32] moved that covering off her
[44:34] and she sit up and pastor
[44:37] uh
[44:38] says
[44:40] that i was with pastor
[44:42] um samuel
[44:44] and he said give her something to eat
[44:47] and you know they first gave her water
[44:50] and she drink and you could see she was
[44:52] weak because she has not eaten for a
[44:54] long time
[44:55] but you know as i i went back across and
[44:57] i i sit down and
[44:59] you know that
[45:01] moment had just taken us over
[45:05] that this girl just
[45:07] rise up from this
[45:09] sickness and she's sitting there
[45:12] and it begins to come to my mind
[45:14] i see this woman
[45:16] walking on a little dirt track
[45:20] and she was coming and she had like
[45:22] two escort that was going with her
[45:25] and in my mind that was
[45:27] demons
[45:29] carrying her really
[45:31] and something tell me she's going to be
[45:33] there i felt her presence before she
[45:35] reached
[45:36] and soon
[45:38] she parted the curtain she was in a
[45:40] yellow dress
[45:41] and she stand right there before us
[45:44] and she was looking her daughter she was
[45:47] surprised or she was dumbstruck
[45:50] because her daughter
[45:51] was well
[45:53] and i said to her
[45:56] why is the demons
[45:58] trying to kill your children
[46:00] and she began to express
[46:02] and you know the brothers were telling
[46:03] me what she was saying she said
[46:05] her husband
[46:06] has taken another woman
[46:09] and she sent the demons to kill all of
[46:11] her seven children
[46:13] and this was number two
[46:15] that was going to be taken
[46:17] and i tell her i said the god
[46:21] who showed me
[46:23] that the demons are with you
[46:25] that same god says
[46:27] none of your children will die
[46:30] i began to talk to her and right there
[46:32] she fall down on her feet and begin to
[46:35] confess her sins to jesus christ
[46:38] amen that was wednesday
[46:41] amen
[46:44] that that was wednesday
[46:46] and on the weekend we baptized her and
[46:49] her daughter her daughter was skipping
[46:51] around really she was happy because god
[46:54] had healed her
[46:55] so
[46:57] the next evening
[46:58] i was brother um
[47:01] samuel ortega house
[47:04] and some men from the town they're
[47:05] coming and so they wanted to see me

[47:09] they come in and say they wanted to see
[47:11] me because they know that family and
[47:13] they're all edens and how did you get
[47:15] them to be converted i said jesus christ

[47:22] witchcraft
[47:23] i tell you there's coming a day when
[47:26] we'll have to stand up on what we
[47:28] believe
[47:29] because there's no god
[47:31] in this world that is more powerful than
[47:35] the god who we serve
[47:37] amen
[47:38] hallelujah and you know
[47:41] she followed me everywhere i go
[47:44] and they had problems because the
[47:47] language you speak
[47:49] most times nobody i'll speak it really
[47:52] so somebody had to sit beside her and
[47:54] try to interpret her and you know she
[47:56] didn't have the basic concepts of
[47:58] christianity but what she know that the
[48:01] god who raised up her daughter
[48:04] hallelujah and enter into her life that
[48:07] god is a true god
[48:09] hallelujah
[48:11] i know that as long as that woman live
[48:13] that testimony is going to be with her
[48:17] and as long as that girl live that
[48:19] testimony is going to be with her
[48:22] hallelujah that's all resurrection
[48:25] something's going to happen in your life
[48:28] an experience that you've got with god
[48:31] that as long as you live you will never
[48:35] forget that experience
[48:38] you know i noticed you know uh brother
[48:40] brady being my pastor for all these
[48:43] years and there's something about
[48:44] brother brady if you know him
[48:47] and you talk to him a little bit
[48:49] he goes back
[48:51] to 1965.
[48:54] and he begins to share with you
[48:56] his testimony
[48:58] when he meet the prophet
[49:00] because that experience that he had back
[49:02] then
[49:03] it was a personal
[49:05] experience with jesus christ
[49:08] and as long as he lived he cannot get
[49:11] past that experience
[49:14] but brethren there's a greater
[49:16] experience with god than that for you
[49:20] that day when he enters into your heart
[49:23] amen your personal
[49:25] resurrection
[49:27] [Music]
[49:28] you know
[49:29] i
[49:31] when something happens when i'm when
[49:34] there's a manifestation of the power of
[49:36] god
[49:37] people becomes drawn to it really
[49:40] and so as i said you know it says it
[49:42] comes not in words only
[49:45] we we can sit and quote quotes and tell
[49:48] the time that we're living in but listen
[49:50] something must follow that word
[49:53] and if we would believe god and don't
[49:56] doubt
[49:56] whatever we want from god he will grant
[49:59] it to us
[50:02] so the
[50:03] the the news spread back to kampala and
[50:06] so the brothers were calling me you know
[50:08] to come back to kampala because we have
[50:10] planned a meeting in kampala we want you
[50:12] to come back to kampala but i was here
[50:15] on this side on the eastern side and
[50:17] brothers i met 11 ministers
[50:19] and so 11 pastors came together for a
[50:23] meeting
[50:24] my brother there was not even a bicycle
[50:28] they all
[50:30] walk their feet
[50:32] you you know in in in africa there they
[50:35] they have what they call buddha buddha
[50:38] it's a motorbike really and that's the
[50:40] taxi
[50:41] you know i tell you i've been on it
[50:43] about two times and brother
[50:45] oh lord
[50:48] hallelujah
[50:49] you know i want to grab him and hold on
[50:52] but you know it's so you got to put your
[50:54] hands behind your brother i'll tell you
[50:56] amen
[50:58] but you know that that's what you know
[50:59] somebody had to drop one off and
[51:01] and you know listening to these brothers
[51:03] they're they're hard workers for the
[51:05] gospel
[51:06] everything in their lives around
[51:08] spreading this message
[51:10] i said man i got to spend time with them
[51:14] but then you know i i left and i went to
[51:16] kampala
[51:18] and um
[51:19] i preached in kampala you know the
[51:21] brothers on the east they tell me they
[51:23] said ah they were calling you you know
[51:26] they're trying to let the people be
[51:27] filled with the holy ghost and and
[51:29] jumping over i said man that's what i
[51:31] really want because if you ain't got the
[51:33] holy ghost you ain't got nothing
[51:36] i don't care what you want to do when
[51:38] you receive him
[51:39] as long as you receive him
[51:41] amen
[51:42] because listen until that day
[51:47] of the revelation of jesus christ's
[51:49] personally to you
[51:51] you just associated with message people
[51:55] brethren like jesus said to nicodemus
[51:58] you must be born again
[52:02] that is the experience of your life you
[52:04] must be born again you must have that
[52:07] personal resurrection in your life then
[52:10] you can stand tall
[52:12] no devil can defeat me because in the
[52:15] name of jesus i remember i was over in
[52:19] liberia
[52:20] and i'd preach
[52:22] and you know the young people just pour
[52:24] into the altar
[52:25] and so you know i was going through and
[52:27] i was praying for them there at the
[52:28] altar
[52:29] and and the brother comes and he
[52:31] whispered in my head he said brother
[52:32] keith
[52:33] there's a woman here that is possessed
[52:35] with the devil she's been insane for a
[52:37] long time you want to pray for her
[52:39] and i didn't even look around maybe if
[52:40] i'd look around brother when i said no
[52:44] so i i said yes and when i turned around
[52:47] this woman they were they were holding
[52:48] on to her and she was like a raging bull
[52:53] she was mad
[52:54] as we would say back room i turned
[52:56] around i said in the name of jesus
[52:59] christ i've never come out of her
[53:01] and that woman that was raging
[53:04] she just swiveled down on the floor
[53:07] and she was postured on the floor
[53:09] and immediately she started to snore
[53:13] she went into a deep sleep
[53:15] that unclean spirit
[53:17] recognized the voice of god and leave
[53:21] out of her really
[53:23] [Applause]
[53:29] when brother caleb duke and took me from
[53:31] the church he said brother keith
[53:33] he said you heard her snore i said
[53:35] certainly
[53:36] he said you believe she's there i said
[53:37] brother she's totally whole
[53:40] she will never again be mad
[53:42] you know why because it's not the first
[53:43] time i've seen that
[53:45] amen the unclean spirit come out of that
[53:47] person and they go right into a deep
[53:50] sleep
[53:51] when they awake from that sleep they'll
[53:53] never be the same again
[53:55] that's the power of the god that we
[53:58] serve because it comes not in words only
[54:02] but in power and demonstration of the
[54:04] holy spirit
[54:06] amen
[54:07] amen
[54:09] so you know
[54:10] they heard what happened in bosnia so
[54:12] they bring me to kampala
[54:15] and now in kampala it was a very
[54:17] established church and you know i was
[54:19] showing you pictures of them dancing
[54:21] today i love those people because
[54:23] they're you see something you you'll
[54:25] sing and you'll you'll clap your and
[54:26] maybe you swing your body but you don't
[54:28] move your feet but we jamaicans when we
[54:29] when we sing when we go to church we
[54:32] move everything
[54:33] [Laughter]
[54:35] amen praise god amen that's just so we
[54:38] are we there's just a dance in us really
[54:41] amen when we go to church we dance some
[54:43] people say well you shouldn't dance in
[54:45] church well david dance and
[54:46] amen god honor him
[54:49] i i tell him i said listen
[54:51] god rebuked david for taking you ra's
[54:54] wife
[54:55] god rebuked david for counting israel
[54:59] but god never rebuked him for dancing
[55:00] before the lord until his clothes drop
[55:03] off
[55:04] so if you've got a problem with it gotta
[55:06] go ask god because god said that's a man
[55:08] after my own heart
[55:12] hate that praise god
[55:14] hallelujah you know i'm crazy but i'm
[55:16] all right
[55:17] amen
[55:20] you know people said well you you're not
[55:21] intellectual enough i tell you what i've
[55:23] got three degrees
[55:25] there and that didn't change me because
[55:27] when i got the holy ghost it changed
[55:29] everything about me
[55:34] amen
[55:36] praise god you know the brothers were
[55:38] talking they're one of the brothers and
[55:40] lecturers said hey i've got a master's
[55:42] degree in business he said brookie you
[55:43] gotta i said yes it's right there and he
[55:46] didn't change me
[55:47] because when you got the holy ghost it
[55:49] doesn't matter what else you got people
[55:50] say well the education will change it
[55:52] certainly didn't change me
[55:54] but you know what those who are around
[55:56] me when i go to school they are all
[55:58] christians
[55:59] [Laughter]
[56:01] amen praise god
[56:03] in the easter seal he said
[56:06] so we are easter
[56:08] amen
[56:09] we are now in our easter we have already
[56:12] raised hallelujah from the things of the
[56:15] world to the things of god's promise
[56:19] the promise of god
[56:21] no not we will we are
[56:24] it's the potentials
[56:27] amen
[56:28] so i've been to kampala and manatee it
[56:31] was a real established church you know
[56:33] real established people but we had a
[56:35] good time
[56:36] so out of that experience you know they
[56:38] they invited me back so i was there in
[56:41] september and they invited me back in um
[56:44] december
[56:46] and we had now a meeting i get a chance
[56:48] now to go to the far west
[56:50] of uganda
[56:53] but you know i should tell you really
[56:55] that before i've ever went to uganda in
[56:58] 2019 i
[57:00] i i was invited to ghana and i went to
[57:03] ghana
[57:04] but before i left for ghana the lord
[57:07] tell me
[57:08] he wants me to go to uganda
[57:11] the only person i can remember in uganda
[57:14] was steve nibali
[57:16] brother um
[57:17] tim amity i know those brothers really
[57:20] but i was online one day and i saw
[57:23] pastor
[57:25] samuel ortega
[57:26] and like the lord said to me
[57:28] that's the brother i should go to
[57:30] and so that's what i went to in the east
[57:33] so they invited me back in december and
[57:35] i went to fort portal and the the way
[57:38] they do their convention really they
[57:39] rent a
[57:40] school this was a secondary school they
[57:43] rent the entire building because school
[57:44] was out and so all the people travel and
[57:47] they stay they camp in the schools for
[57:50] the meetings really and they bring food
[57:53] they bring cassava and banana and all
[57:55] that really and beans
[57:57] you know
[57:58] i was thinking i said man there's no
[58:00] meat
[58:03] and i can remember the first um day of
[58:05] the meeting really um the the buses did
[58:09] not arrive with all the food so all they
[58:11] had was cassava so what they did they
[58:13] they just simply roast the cassava and
[58:15] these hundreds of people they just eat
[58:18] cassava and everybody was contented and
[58:20] they drink water and they went to bed
[58:23] i said man my lord
[58:26] sometimes we've got so much
[58:28] and we still complain
[58:31] amen
[58:32] but they were satisfied with whatever
[58:34] they had because they were under great
[58:36] expectation for the word of god
[58:40] amen
[58:42] you know that meeting i was really
[58:44] challenged because
[58:46] the the brothers claim that they they've
[58:48] never seen no manifestation of the holy
[58:50] spirit that was an insult
[58:52] but you know what god came down and
[58:55] confirmed his word
[58:58] there were so many things happening that
[59:00] they had to take one service for the
[59:02] people to testify of the acts of healing
[59:04] and deliverance and the baptism of the
[59:06] holy ghost that they had received really
[59:11] and i saw one brother he's a minister
[59:15] and i preached
[59:16] and i was true
[59:18] and he started to
[59:20] prophesy but what i recognized was
[59:22] happening he was calling the ministers
[59:25] the people by name
[59:27] and he was like telling them what god
[59:29] says
[59:30] i never seen anything like this before
[59:32] so you know i usually so wet when i re
[59:35] so i go and i i change
[59:38] that was an experience
[59:41] because in the bathrooms really you know
[59:43] you've got a seat to sit on it's just a
[59:45] hole in the ground
[59:47] so you you go down and you you know like
[59:50] when i was a cadet i've never been a
[59:51] sober you gotta shuffle until you you
[59:53] align properly
[59:59] and uh i said but man this must be hard
[1:00:02] for the whole people no because they've
[1:00:03] done that all their lives
[1:00:05] so it's easy for them really but you
[1:00:07] know i remember i go to change and i
[1:00:09] came back and the brother got so weak
[1:00:11] his
[1:00:12] he just went off his feet really i took
[1:00:15] him up and i i hugged him and i prayed
[1:00:17] for him and he got his foot in back
[1:00:20] you know his name is brother talent
[1:00:22] he is a gifted minister
[1:00:25] i saw him wherever ever know and every
[1:00:28] time i have a problem in my family or so
[1:00:30] i wrote by the talent
[1:00:32] he's just tremendous warrior
[1:00:34] for god
[1:00:36] amen precious people
[1:00:38] you know one minister came to me and he
[1:00:40] said brother keith he said for seven
[1:00:42] years
[1:00:43] i had a back problem
[1:00:46] he said i've suffered in pain
[1:00:49] and he said but when you say do you
[1:00:50] believe
[1:00:52] he said i held my hand in the ear
[1:00:54] and he said the seven years
[1:00:56] of problems
[1:00:58] of pain
[1:00:59] he said it left me at that minute
[1:01:05] because that's what we need
[1:01:08] we need to believe
[1:01:11] we need to believe
[1:01:13] and i was really sharing with them the
[1:01:15] story of brother branham and the
[1:01:17] squirrels
[1:01:19] and you know
[1:01:20] brother brahms said
[1:01:22] when he did not find the fort squirrel
[1:01:25] and he went back to camp brother tony
[1:01:28] prayed
[1:01:29] and brother tony says lord
[1:01:31] if brother branham is talking the truth
[1:01:33] let him find the fort's krill
[1:01:35] brother branham was hurt in his feelings
[1:01:37] because he said brother tony had a wife
[1:01:40] that was crippled on the cut and i
[1:01:42] prayed for her and she recovered
[1:01:44] and he's doubting me
[1:01:46] so when he went back
[1:01:48] to the hunting site he was under
[1:01:50] pressure
[1:01:51] and he went and he looked where the
[1:01:53] scroll is supposed to be and he said
[1:01:55] i couldn't find it
[1:01:56] but the word was
[1:01:59] did you not say
[1:02:01] because if you say and believe god will
[1:02:04] bring it to pass
[1:02:07] brethren your healing is not so far from
[1:02:09] you
[1:02:11] if you would take childlike fate in all
[1:02:13] of it really
[1:02:15] god is obligated
[1:02:17] the prophet said god will bankrupt
[1:02:19] heaven
[1:02:20] before he let one promise
[1:02:24] and that is for
[1:02:26] the bride
[1:02:28] amen
[1:02:30] and just
[1:02:31] sharing that with them
[1:02:33] it put their faith into a frenzy
[1:02:36] if you would say if you would believe
[1:02:40] god will operate in your body do you
[1:02:42] believe
[1:02:45] and the healing virtues of god
[1:02:47] swept through that place thousands of
[1:02:49] people
[1:02:52] people want to share their testimony but
[1:02:54] there was no time
[1:02:56] but the mighty god unveiled before us
[1:03:00] amen
[1:03:02] and so
[1:03:04] oh
[1:03:05] so they they invited me back 2020 easter
[1:03:09] because they wanted to see something
[1:03:10] like that again
[1:03:12] and i couldn't go but when i went back
[1:03:14] this year
[1:03:15] i didn't preach the manifestation
[1:03:18] because brethren
[1:03:20] the manifestations of the holy spirit is
[1:03:23] an attraction
[1:03:25] we're not the only ones that have it
[1:03:28] we've got the word to back up every
[1:03:31] promise of god
[1:03:34] because there's people who are just
[1:03:35] signed seekers if they can see a sign
[1:03:39] but the message means more than the
[1:03:41] manifestation of the holy spirit but the
[1:03:43] manifestation tells you that god is
[1:03:45] there
[1:03:48] the manifestation in brother branham's
[1:03:49] life if if that was not there many of
[1:03:51] you wouldn't even be here
[1:03:54] i had a brother one time in church well
[1:03:56] he's still in church
[1:03:57] but when he take a message book
[1:04:00] he doesn't read from the front
[1:04:02] or where the scripture is read he go to
[1:04:04] the back
[1:04:05] after the message is finished
[1:04:07] and brother branham begin to pray for
[1:04:09] the sick and that's the portion of it he
[1:04:11] reads
[1:04:13] because he's trapped in that
[1:04:15] and the word
[1:04:17] doesn't mean he'll go around and he'll
[1:04:19] tell everybody
[1:04:21] about the things that happen
[1:04:23] but the word
[1:04:25] he didn't even read that part
[1:04:30] he will never have deliverance
[1:04:33] and he will never come to the revelation
[1:04:35] of the word of god
[1:04:37] because that's not it
[1:04:39] amen
[1:04:40] it's the word being restored to you
[1:04:43] and the word is restored then every
[1:04:45] promise of god
[1:04:47] is also restored to you
[1:04:50] amen
[1:04:51] hallelujah so i went back in easter
[1:04:56] and i begin i i've seen
[1:04:58] that
[1:05:00] you know when you have a place where
[1:05:02] somebody preach
[1:05:03] that the seven thunder is the seventh
[1:05:05] virtues
[1:05:08] then you know it leads the people off
[1:05:11] and they they know it's not exactly
[1:05:15] but what is going to bring them back to
[1:05:16] the true word
[1:05:19] and so people become scared of certain
[1:05:22] things really
[1:05:24] and and so once you
[1:05:25] speak of the seven seals they they begin
[1:05:28] to
[1:05:29] you know back off
[1:05:30] but they had confidence
[1:05:32] because they had seen a mighty move of
[1:05:35] god
[1:05:37] amen and so i preach the opening
[1:05:40] of the word
[1:05:41] and i show them
[1:05:43] that the message
[1:05:45] is not signs and gifts
[1:05:47] but because god opened those seals to us
[1:05:51] and our records will search all the way
[1:05:53] back we have redemption by that word
[1:05:58] brother stephen that was with me at camp
[1:06:00] meeting he said brother keith your
[1:06:02] mighty help to the ministers
[1:06:05] and i hear them say well i'm going back
[1:06:07] to read that book
[1:06:10] because many of them they've heard
[1:06:12] they've never read it right
[1:06:15] we're encompassing this mountain
[1:06:19] of the first and second pole and they're
[1:06:21] trapped there
[1:06:23] but let me say this to you
[1:06:25] and this might just be me
[1:06:28] but whatever problems are in your life
[1:06:33] if you go to a church and it's not
[1:06:35] preach
[1:06:36] it's not helping you
[1:06:39] it's not going to help you really
[1:06:42] you see
[1:06:43] when a demon is exposed
[1:06:46] it will go from you
[1:06:49] and if you are bound by anything
[1:06:52] the word is what releases you from it
[1:06:54] really
[1:06:56] so
[1:06:57] you know you notice that what happened
[1:07:01] if there's polygamy they stick together
[1:07:05] because that spirit keep them together
[1:07:08] and so when a
[1:07:10] when when a man is preaching the gospel
[1:07:12] and he's got two living wives and others
[1:07:16] come right there beside him
[1:07:18] and a spirit listen
[1:07:20] lord do you slay me
[1:07:22] yet will i trust you
[1:07:26] sin is sin unbelief is unbelief
[1:07:30] not because you'd walk the devil let you
[1:07:32] walk a road and it leaves a scar in your
[1:07:35] life
[1:07:36] god will remove that scar
[1:07:38] god will remove that complex
[1:07:41] don't rally around the spirit
[1:07:43] that bound you
[1:07:44] no
[1:07:45] run from it
[1:07:48] run from it
[1:07:50] because if the words don't release you
[1:07:52] what's going to do it
[1:07:54] amen
[1:07:56] that's where i am
[1:07:59] you know it's like you tell your
[1:08:00] children like
[1:08:01] when you were young and you caught you
[1:08:03] you were perfect
[1:08:05] and they're looking at you and
[1:08:07] they're now seeing the things that are
[1:08:09] happening and and they said man you must
[1:08:11] have lived in a perfect world
[1:08:13] you know after you many times your
[1:08:15] children are smarter than you are
[1:08:17] because i find that every generation is
[1:08:19] smarter than the one before
[1:08:22] brother dale and stephanie when you were
[1:08:24] young
[1:08:25] you you thought that you hey but when we
[1:08:27] came up really we know more than you
[1:08:29] know back then and our children today
[1:08:32] you said you're going to tell them the
[1:08:33] facts of like oh we know that already
[1:08:37] because it's online you're afraid to
[1:08:39] talk about it really it's taboo but it's
[1:08:41] everywhere around them
[1:08:43] the music that that is playing well you
[1:08:46] know your society is different from ours
[1:08:49] but our children has got to take maybe a
[1:08:51] taxi to school they're going to take a
[1:08:53] taxi back home
[1:08:55] the music
[1:08:56] and i'll tell you there's something
[1:08:57] about jamaica
[1:08:59] we are a small country
[1:09:01] of 200 quarter million people but we are
[1:09:04] known throughout the world
[1:09:07] by our music
[1:09:09] by our food
[1:09:11] if it's sports
[1:09:13] you know jamaica
[1:09:15] i was in uganda and i'm in the hotel and
[1:09:16] i can't sleep because reggae music is
[1:09:19] stomping down the road
[1:09:23] so you thought you traveled all these
[1:09:25] thousands of miles you're away from it
[1:09:27] notice in the heartbeat of the people
[1:09:32] how did we ever get there i was up in
[1:09:34] liberia in the slum
[1:09:36] and on the the maras that the wall full
[1:09:40] of fungus and all of that they write
[1:09:42] gully and gaza you don't know what that
[1:09:45] is but that comes right from kingston
[1:09:48] jamaica
[1:09:49] it's our musicians when they polarize
[1:09:52] themselves and fight
[1:09:55] they take side
[1:09:57] and all the way among the
[1:09:58] poverty-stricken people they embrace
[1:10:01] that
[1:10:02] we
[1:10:03] we export the worst of the worst
[1:10:06] of the worst
[1:10:09] just a few years ago i could say
[1:10:12] 90 of our women
[1:10:14] wear dress or a skirt
[1:10:17] brother i tell you
[1:10:18] not today
[1:10:20] and if you think in new york they
[1:10:22] they're naked
[1:10:23] come over to jamaica
[1:10:26] and you will see
[1:10:28] the music today it is the lowest of the
[1:10:31] degrading of the lowest that ever was
[1:10:35] come out of human lips
[1:10:37] and that is what our children are
[1:10:39] hearing
[1:10:40] and to come around and have to deal with
[1:10:43] that
[1:10:45] i tell families really
[1:10:47] you can't just let your children go by
[1:10:49] you've got to sit with them around the
[1:10:51] table you've got to know what they know
[1:10:54] and what they've got to go through
[1:10:56] because you've got to beat that demon
[1:10:58] out of them
[1:11:00] if they come up and stand up
[1:11:03] it takes the grace
[1:11:05] of god
[1:11:08] the fact that my children can go
[1:11:09] anywhere and they're still a christian
[1:11:12] it's not because of me it's because of
[1:11:14] the grace and the mercies of almighty
[1:11:17] god
[1:11:21] because you know
[1:11:23] i was writing a paper
[1:11:25] doing a business degree
[1:11:27] and and there was a musician that we
[1:11:28] were supposed to
[1:11:30] critique
[1:11:31] is is music
[1:11:34] and man i'll tell you what i never heard
[1:11:36] the music because i don't listen
[1:11:38] and worse i wouldn't know what it said
[1:11:41] but i come home and i say it and daniel
[1:11:44] she was in high school she wrote the
[1:11:46] lyrics and gave to me
[1:11:48] word by word by word and she's baptized
[1:11:55] but if you travel in a taxi at a place
[1:11:57] every day
[1:11:58] somehow
[1:12:00] when i listen i just yeah
[1:12:02] [Music]
[1:12:06] we say all we hear is booga wagga booga
[1:12:08] but they hear every word
[1:12:13] and that's what they've got to deal with
[1:12:16] that's just the truth
[1:12:18] that's just the truth
[1:12:19] so that's why sometimes you gotta
[1:12:22] you know take them in your hands
[1:12:25] pray for them
[1:12:28] and ask god to have mercy
[1:12:30] because the age that they're going
[1:12:33] through
[1:12:34] spiritually you you know it's bad
[1:12:37] but the things that they've got to deal
[1:12:39] with
[1:12:40] certain words in school we never say it
[1:12:43] no you can't say that
[1:12:46] but it's cool today oh my lord
[1:12:52] so we know
[1:12:54] as we look at you that's why we pray for
[1:12:55] you young people
[1:12:57] because we know the devil is in your
[1:12:58] corner
[1:13:00] but the blood of jesus christ is on you
[1:13:03] and he will save you from all of that
[1:13:07] he will save you from all of that
[1:13:09] [Applause]
[1:13:11] and when he gives you a personal
[1:13:14] resurrection no devil can stop you
[1:13:18] that's why in a church you know
[1:13:19] sometimes we you guard your children
[1:13:22] you don't want the deacons to talk to
[1:13:24] them you don't want nobody say anything
[1:13:25] to your children if they talk to you you
[1:13:27] get offended you ought to be happy
[1:13:30] when when they help you with your
[1:13:32] children
[1:13:34] amen
[1:13:35] because it takes the grace of god
[1:13:38] you can't do it yourself in africa they
[1:13:40] said it takes a community to grow a
[1:13:43] child
[1:13:44] you know when i was growing up really
[1:13:45] though i mean naturally if you do
[1:13:47] something on the road that wasn't right
[1:13:49] anybody any adult could whip your skin
[1:13:53] yeah that's
[1:13:54] that's the way it is
[1:13:56] amen
[1:13:57] my mama thank god for her when she whip
[1:14:00] us really she save it
[1:14:03] until everybody was guilty of something
[1:14:05] then she did it one time
[1:14:08] you you had no time to laugh at nobody
[1:14:10] because once you start with one you you
[1:14:13] wait your turn because everybody's going
[1:14:15] to get it really sometimes you start one
[1:14:17] what did i do but you know you're going
[1:14:19] to get it
[1:14:23] but what a promise god has given to us
[1:14:27] but when you have a personal
[1:14:29] resurrection
[1:14:31] it doesn't matter the society you live
[1:14:32] in it doesn't matter things you go
[1:14:34] through god is able to keep that which
[1:14:38] you have committed unto him against that
[1:14:41] day
[1:14:42] hallelujah
[1:14:43] amen
[1:14:46] praise god
[1:14:47] in the easter seal
[1:14:50] paragraph 122
[1:14:52] if we are ordained on that drone
[1:14:55] if you are ordained to be under that
[1:14:57] ground like the eagle walking in the
[1:15:00] chicken nest
[1:15:02] if you're ordained on that ground the
[1:15:04] holy spirit is here to find you
[1:15:08] and when it finds you you recognize its
[1:15:11] call
[1:15:13] you know the hour we're living
[1:15:16] you know that these things are supposed
[1:15:18] to happen
[1:15:20] quickly
[1:15:21] you are raptured up to meet it
[1:15:24] and now we are sitting in heavenly
[1:15:26] places
[1:15:27] in christ jesus
[1:15:29] hallelujah
[1:15:31] in christ the mystery of god reveal
[1:15:33] paragraph 484

[1:15:38] in the individual with a personal
[1:15:40] vindication of himself expressing
[1:15:44] himself
[1:15:45] the living word
[1:15:46] its promise for for the day expressing
[1:15:50] itself through you a vindication of the
[1:15:52] great revelation of god
[1:15:54] look
[1:15:55] only in an individual never in a group
[1:15:59] you've got to have
[1:16:01] your personal revelation of who jesus
[1:16:04] christ is
[1:16:05] you can't go on nobody else's experience
[1:16:08] i think joshua for all them 40 years he
[1:16:12] could have gone and said moses tell me
[1:16:14] one more time
[1:16:16] moses
[1:16:17] would have re rehearsed
[1:16:20] what happened in mount sinai
[1:16:22] but joshua
[1:16:24] before he get to jordan god gave him his
[1:16:27] own experience he met the man
[1:16:30] so he didn't dwell on moses experience i
[1:16:33] met the man with the sword and he said
[1:16:35] take off your shoes from off your feet
[1:16:38] amen
[1:16:39] hallelujah you've got to meet god for
[1:16:41] yourself
[1:16:44] don't take a false sense of security i'm
[1:16:47] in the message no sir

[1:16:51] light in your life and you've got your
[1:16:55] resurrection

[1:16:58] then you are sure
[1:17:00] you are sure that when you say it
[1:17:03] god act upon it
[1:17:06] amen
[1:17:07] hallelujah

[1:17:13] with an individual
[1:17:16] hallelujah not with the methodists not
[1:17:18] with the baptist not with the
[1:17:19] presbyterian not with the lutheran not
[1:17:21] with a pentecostal but as an individual
[1:17:24] i'll take one i leave one
[1:17:27] i'll separate them
[1:17:29] there'll be two in the field one shall
[1:17:31] be taken hallelujah there'll be two in
[1:17:33] the bed and one shall be one take one

[1:18:00] and the revelation of jesus christ come
[1:18:02] down to the bride
[1:18:04] he said i call you bride
[1:18:06] amen
[1:18:08] you're the wife of god amen then christ
[1:18:10] the mystery of god revealed he said the
[1:18:12] bride pregnant pregnant with the seed
[1:18:15] word of god
[1:18:17] she couldn't be pregnant unless she was
[1:18:18] married

[1:19:24] now that's a good question nothing's
[1:19:26] wrong with that he said what is the
[1:19:28] carcass the carcass is what the eagle
[1:19:30] feed on
[1:19:32] now
[1:19:32] an eagle is considered in the bible a
[1:19:35] prophet
[1:19:37] a prophet is an eagle god called himself
[1:19:40] an eagle and we are eaglets the
[1:19:43] believers

[1:19:53] of the bird will show itself an eagle
[1:19:57] which wants fresh meat

[1:20:28] that's where the eagles are
[1:20:30] where the carcass is
[1:20:32] the word
[1:20:34] and so when the word comes
[1:20:36] don't call up and say well we've got the
[1:20:38] word no put the word in action

[1:21:56] that's just who i am
[1:21:58] the anointed ones in the end time 269
[1:22:01] i wasn't the one that appeared down on
[1:22:03] the river
[1:22:05] i was only standing there when he
[1:22:06] appeared
[1:22:08] i'm not the one that performed these
[1:22:10] things and foretell these things that
[1:22:12] happen as perfect as they are
[1:22:14] i was only that one near when he does it
[1:22:18] i was only a voice that he used
[1:22:21] to say it
[1:22:22] it wasn't what i knew
[1:22:25] it's what i just surrendered myself to
[1:22:29] hallelujah that is spoke true
[1:22:32] it wasn't me it wasn't the seventh angel
[1:22:36] oh no it was the manifestation of the
[1:22:39] son of man
[1:22:40] it wasn't the angel
[1:22:43] his message
[1:22:44] it was the mystery that god unfolded
[1:22:48] it's not a man
[1:22:50] it is god
[1:22:53] the angel was not the son of man
[1:22:55] he was the messenger from the son of man
[1:22:59] the son of man is christ
[1:23:02] and he is the one that we are feeding on
[1:23:06] all little eagles that's who we're
[1:23:08] feeding on we're not feeding on a man
[1:23:10] a man his word will fail
[1:23:13] but we are feeding on the unfailing body
[1:23:15] word of the
[1:23:17] son of man
[1:23:19] when we go for it we know who we are
[1:23:22] you know brother wade you said well i i
[1:23:25] never had an act of healing in my
[1:23:27] ministry i've never had that you don't
[1:23:28] worry about it
[1:23:30] you just say what your desire is and
[1:23:33] what god perform it
[1:23:35] and when you have confidence that god
[1:23:37] will keep his word then when the devil
[1:23:40] presents something say the word of god
[1:23:43] and watch god
[1:23:44] do the rest
[1:23:46] because brother branham said it wasn't
[1:23:47] me
[1:23:48] it was it wasn't the seventh angel it
[1:23:52] was the son of man
[1:23:54] and if the word is with us
[1:23:58] if we are that people
[1:24:00] if we are
[1:24:01] the wife of almighty god wherever we go
[1:24:05] the manifestation of the word
[1:24:07] will bring
[1:24:09] hallelujah the vindication that god is
[1:24:11] here with us
[1:24:12] [Music]
[1:24:13] we live below our privileges
[1:24:16] hallelujah because we are afraid
[1:24:19] to put god
[1:24:21] on the stand
[1:24:22] to put him to the test
[1:24:24] but listen if you will believe
[1:24:27] god will do the rest you believe that
[1:24:30] hallelujah oh let me close right here in
[1:24:32] romans 8 and verse 10
[1:24:35] and if christ be in you
[1:24:38] the word
[1:24:39] amen
[1:24:41] the body is dead because of sin but the
[1:24:44] spirit is life because of righteousness
[1:24:47] but the spirit of him that rays of jesus
[1:24:50] from the dead dwelling you
[1:24:53] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:24:55] shall also quicken
[1:24:57] your mortal bodies by spirit that dwells
[1:25:00] in you
[1:25:01] therefore brethren
[1:25:03] we are adapters not to the flesh
[1:25:05] to live after the flesh for if we live
[1:25:08] after the flesh we shall die
[1:25:10] but if we truly the spirit do mortify
[1:25:14] bring to the undertaker
[1:25:16] the deeds of our body he shall live
[1:25:20] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:25:23] god
[1:25:24] they are the sons of god
[1:25:27] and the prophet of god said before god
[1:25:30] let one promise
[1:25:33] come to doubt he will bankrupt all of
[1:25:36] heaven
[1:25:37] what an investment
[1:25:39] in you and i
[1:25:41] it's not because we don't have it
[1:25:44] it's because we don't take the
[1:25:45] confidence by the world to see god
[1:25:47] manifest in our lives really
[1:25:50] amen whatever we stand in need of you
[1:25:52] know god wants to meet your need before
[1:25:55] you even have that need
[1:25:57] you believe that
[1:25:59] amen
[1:26:00] god want to heal your sicknesses
[1:26:03] before that sickness befall you
[1:26:06] but you've got to believe
[1:26:08] if god would really teach us as
[1:26:10] believers
[1:26:12] to take childlike faith in his word
[1:26:16] nothing will stand
[1:26:18] before us
[1:26:20] nothing will stand before us
[1:26:22] you know i thank god that
[1:26:25] i can be a blessing
[1:26:27] i thank god that i can go
[1:26:30] well it takes faith first of all to go
[1:26:33] i i remember i was in johannesburg
[1:26:37] and i'm thinking i should i was on my
[1:26:39] way back home from
[1:26:40] zimbabwe and i stopped over to see the
[1:26:42] brethren
[1:26:43] and i was thinking i said what is this
[1:26:45] that i've put on myself
[1:26:47] brother i was thinking of a flight to
[1:26:49] new york of 18 and a half hours
[1:26:52] and i said i don't like flying i'm
[1:26:53] afraid of flying really
[1:26:55] because i'm afraid of not having control
[1:26:58] you know if the plane shifter i'm
[1:27:00] wondering i wonder if he's having a
[1:27:02] problem
[1:27:04] because i'm the kind of person i solve
[1:27:06] problems really i've got a group of let
[1:27:09] um engineers and technicians so about 38
[1:27:12] of them really and you know when they
[1:27:13] have a problem they tell me i tell them
[1:27:14] what to do so when there's a shake or a
[1:27:17] rattle i'm wondering
[1:27:19] you know i hate flying but i've got to
[1:27:22] do it
[1:27:24] the only reason i will do it is because
[1:27:27] of the grace and the mercies of almighty
[1:27:29] god
[1:27:30] because i know that he sent me
[1:27:32] and i will go
[1:27:34] amen and you know i want you all to
[1:27:36] remember this one thing
[1:27:38] i'm a product of this church
[1:27:43] you you might not know that
[1:27:45] but i can recite my notes
[1:27:49] that samuel dale preached
[1:27:51] many years ago word for word the quotes
[1:27:54] that he use
[1:27:56] because that was my teacher
[1:27:58] to bring me into the revelation of the
[1:28:00] word of god
[1:28:07] and i go to there
[1:28:10] i go today
[1:28:11] to be a blessing
[1:28:15] and i thank god i tell them back home
[1:28:18] i've never preached a message
[1:28:20] and put it out that i have to take it
[1:28:22] back
[1:28:24] no
[1:28:25] by the grace of god
[1:28:27] amen
[1:28:29] and have prayed for sickness
[1:28:31] and they are healed in the name of jesus
[1:28:35] because i believe
[1:28:37] and i believe with the restoration of
[1:28:39] that word to us the power of god must be
[1:28:42] in our midst
[1:28:44] but sometimes we get too complacent
[1:28:47] to what god has already given to us
[1:28:49] really
[1:28:51] but you know in the bible it says
[1:28:53] capernaum
[1:28:55] all capernaum
[1:28:57] if the mighty works that were done in
[1:28:59] you
[1:28:59] were done in sodom and gomorrah
[1:29:02] they would have repented
[1:29:05] we ought to recognize
[1:29:07] what's in our
[1:29:08] midst amen
[1:29:10] and the word of god that has been
[1:29:12] invested in us really
[1:29:14] let us not take it lightly because when
[1:29:16] the word is put to test
[1:29:19] it brings forth the manifestation of god
[1:29:21] amen
[1:29:22] and um am i going to go again i'm
[1:29:25] certainly going to go
[1:29:27] and i'm certainly going to do more
[1:29:29] and i pray god give me the strength
[1:29:32] he said bro keith how do you afford it
[1:29:34] i put it on my credit card and god take
[1:29:37] care of it some other time
[1:29:43] you know
[1:29:45] i was telling a brother
[1:29:47] i said
[1:29:48] the money that i was giving to the
[1:29:50] people
[1:29:51] the brothers in uganda i had it from
[1:29:54] 2019
[1:29:55] and i had it in an envelope in my draw
[1:29:58] because when somebody give me an
[1:29:59] offering i use it for the mission field
[1:30:02] and so i use what i have and god
[1:30:04] provide god is a mighty provider
[1:30:08] and if this word is a truth
[1:30:10] then god would want it to be preached
[1:30:14] right across the globe
[1:30:16] and if you don't go i will go and if you
[1:30:19] can't go send me because i will go and i
[1:30:21] will take it
[1:30:22] and let the word of god live again
[1:30:26] in the body of the believers
[1:30:28] may god bless you
[1:30:30] may god bless you lulu
[1:30:37] i've had many friends over the years but
[1:30:39] i thank god for this church
[1:30:41] and for the love
[1:30:43] and for the word of god that when fought
[1:30:46] you know and so i remember some years
[1:30:48] ago when we
[1:30:49] i invited brother dale to come and
[1:30:50] preach for bishops cars convention
[1:30:53] because he said i want a teacher to um
[1:30:57] preach in my convention and bring
[1:30:58] brother dale
[1:30:59] i heard many ministers criticize
[1:31:03] do you you know and what they'll say did
[1:31:04] you tell them about brother burnham
[1:31:07] no he told him about jesus christ he
[1:31:10] preached the revelation of jesus christ
[1:31:12] that's what he preached
[1:31:14] amen and brother we you were there we
[1:31:16] can see them
[1:31:18] you know bickering there in the
[1:31:20] congregation because some say they are
[1:31:22] jesus only some said
[1:31:24] because the word was dividing them
[1:31:29] and that's what we need today if you've
[1:31:31] got the word what did you do with it
[1:31:34] let us realize let's not get slutful in
[1:31:37] this last little hour
[1:31:39] this is the evening time
[1:31:41] and if there are those to hear it let
[1:31:43] them hear it
[1:31:45] send it out and let them hear it if you
[1:31:46] are tired of it
[1:31:48] say it let them hear it really because
[1:31:50] this word is going to prepare a bride
[1:31:52] for a rapture and god said it and it
[1:31:55] cannot fail
[1:31:56] amen may god bless the people of god and
[1:31:59] may we keep the fire burning until the
[1:32:02] day of jesus christ god bless you god
[1:32:04] bless you can stand on your feet
[1:32:07] amen
[1:32:09] praise god
[1:32:25] of the message of the hour
[1:32:27] he just happened to meet dad a long time
[1:32:29] ago and
[1:32:30] become a
[1:32:32] someone that would listen
[1:32:34] if somebody listen every once in a while
[1:32:36] they might get something
[1:32:38] right
[1:32:38] you
[1:32:41] but
[1:32:42] like he said a lot of people don't want
[1:32:44] teaching anymore
[1:32:46] they think it's boring they think it's
[1:32:48] uh
[1:32:49] um
[1:32:50] doesn't have any power
[1:32:53] well it does have power
[1:32:55] the word of god has power
[1:32:58] always has power before we get before we
[1:33:00] start on our communion let's just bow
[1:33:02] our heads if you have a need
[1:33:04] just raise your hands if you have a need
[1:33:06] we'll
[1:33:07] we'll pray over those needs and then
[1:33:09] we'll go right into communion and foot
[1:33:11] washing
[1:33:12] and just lift our hands and if you need
[1:33:13] something we won't have to come up here
[1:33:15] to the
[1:33:15] to the altar i believe brother keith
[1:33:17] preached the word of god today
[1:33:19] i believe he's opened the channel for
[1:33:21] you to have faith
[1:33:23] for you to have faith and not just him
[1:33:25] but faith in the word because the words
[1:33:26] what backed him up he didn't back him up
[1:33:28] the word backed him up
[1:33:30] we have no power at all
[1:33:32] we're given power by god
[1:33:34] and it's through the word of god
[1:33:36] and power and demonstration so let's
[1:33:38] pray dear heavenly father
[1:33:41] lord we've heard a wonderful message
[1:33:42] lord
[1:33:44] a testimony of a
[1:33:46] of a man that went to another country
[1:33:50] and was challenged by many demons
[1:33:53] well lord we may not be in foreign
[1:33:55] countries but we get challenged by those
[1:33:57] same demons every day
[1:33:59] the demons of this or that of the other
[1:34:01] it doesn't really matter
[1:34:03] we have them here in the states
[1:34:05] they have them overseas they have them
[1:34:07] in jamaica but we've got one god
[1:34:10] and jesus christ is his name
[1:34:13] and that one name there's no other name
[1:34:15] under heaven whereby men can be saved
[1:34:18] and that doesn't mean all just saved

[1:37:13] to be with us
[1:37:15] so let's turn if you want to and read
[1:37:16] with us in first corinthians 11 23
[1:37:21] paul is coming and telling us what the
[1:37:23] uh
[1:37:23] what the
[1:37:26] lord say come to the lord's table and he
[1:37:27] gets a revelation he wasn't there that
[1:37:29] night
[1:37:30] but he got a clear understanding and a
[1:37:32] clear revelation of what went on god
[1:37:34] give it to paul to give it to us
[1:37:37] to break it down just like this for i
[1:37:39] have received of the lord that which i
[1:37:41] delivered unto you that the lord jesus
[1:37:43] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:37:44] took bread
[1:37:46] when he had given thanks he breaking and
[1:37:48] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:37:51] broken for you this due in remembrance
[1:37:54] of me after the same manner also he took
[1:37:56] the cup and when he had sup saying this
[1:37:58] cup is the new testament in my blood he
[1:38:02] had to die to become a new testament so
[1:38:05] he's telling them he's getting ready to
[1:38:06] go
[1:38:07] but he's going to come back the cup is
[1:38:09] the new testament in my blood this you
[1:38:11] do as often as you drink it
[1:38:13] in remembrance of me
[1:38:15] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:38:17] drink this cup you do sure the lord's
[1:38:19] death until he comes
[1:38:21] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:38:22] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:38:24] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:38:26] and blood of the lord
[1:38:28] but let a man examine himself thank god
[1:38:30] paul thank you paul give us an out give
[1:38:32] us a way to get us give us away so we
[1:38:34] can take this communion
[1:38:36] amen but let a man examine himself
[1:38:39] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:38:40] drink of that cup for he that is and
[1:38:42] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:38:44] damnation and to himself not discerning
[1:38:47] the lord's body for this cause many are
[1:38:49] weak and sickly among you in many sleep
[1:38:52] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:38:54] should not be judged but when we are
[1:38:56] judged we are chasten of the lord
[1:38:58] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:39:00] world thank god
[1:39:02] wherefore my brother when you come
[1:39:04] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:39:06] and if any man hunger lady meet at home
[1:39:07] that you come down into condemnation and
[1:39:09] the rest will i set an order
[1:39:11] when i come so let's just take a moment
[1:39:13] of silent prayer
[1:39:15] clearing our mind out clearing our heart
[1:39:17] out getting everything out of the way
[1:39:19] brother brown said pray for your pastor
[1:39:22] all right let's pray for brother dale
[1:39:24] let's pray for the deacons and all the
[1:39:26] preachers and all the all the ones in
[1:39:28] the church and let's get our minds clear
[1:39:29] so we can take communion and when we
[1:39:31] take this communion we're going to
[1:39:32] remember
[1:39:35] that there was a man died on the cross
[1:39:38] and this is in symbol what we're going
[1:39:40] to go through today is a symbol that he
[1:39:42] told us
[1:39:44] to do until he comes so we're going to
[1:39:46] do this according to what god said so
[1:39:47] that that way when you eat the bread and
[1:39:50] you drink the the cup you're doing what
[1:39:51] god said amen so if you have a need if
[1:39:54] you have a something in your body if you
[1:39:56] have if you need salvation
[1:39:58] take that cup
[1:40:00] take that bread
[1:40:02] and take the communion
[1:40:04] because he said he would bless us
[1:40:06] will not come into condemnation
[1:40:09] amen
[1:40:10] let's have a moment of silent prayer
[1:40:26] we thank you lord for all things jesus
[1:40:28] name we pray amen
[1:40:32] the bible said he took the bread and he
[1:40:33] blessed the lord
[1:40:35] this is made by holy hands
[1:40:38] every time we do this i remember way
[1:40:40] back long time ago
[1:40:43] when mom and dad used to serve the
[1:40:44] communion in the baptist church and
[1:40:46] they'd take it out of the freezer and it
[1:40:47] was held over and it was just a little
[1:40:49] small wafer but lord
[1:40:51] that's not what you said to do
[1:40:54] we're not going to hold over any
[1:40:55] revelation when this is over with
[1:40:56] tonight we're going to take this bread
[1:40:58] home we're going to burn it
[1:41:00] where it's inedible so that tomorrow we
[1:41:02] can get new revelation
[1:41:04] lord your body was broken one time
[1:41:07] and it was broken for me and the
[1:41:09] brothers and sisters around the world
[1:41:10] that are the pride of jesus christ so
[1:41:13] now as we look down at this bread lord i
[1:41:14] pray that you're sanctified
[1:41:16] to our bodies lord and bless us in jesus
[1:41:19] name
[1:41:20] amen
[1:41:23] yeah you know we didn't have any
[1:41:24] understanding then we were in the
[1:41:25] baptist church we'd buy that mom and dad
[1:41:27] to buy it
[1:41:28] from some kind of
[1:41:30] uh purchasing house and they don't tell
[1:41:34] who made the bread it was just a little
[1:41:36] square a little like a cracker but it
[1:41:38] was little and uh
[1:41:41] and they put it in the freezer
[1:41:43] and
[1:41:45] well not a lot of people you know
[1:41:47] took communion that sunday then you just
[1:41:49] put it back in the freezer and the next
[1:41:51] time you had communion you pulled it out
[1:41:53] of the freezer and used it again well
[1:41:54] that
[1:41:55] according to the word you're not going
[1:41:56] to do that
[1:41:58] you're not supposed to hold over
[1:42:00] what happened to the manna
[1:42:02] what happened to that manna
[1:42:04] it rot it had wiggle tails brother brown
[1:42:06] called it right
[1:42:08] why because you're not supposed to hold
[1:42:09] over the word of god it goes against new
[1:42:11] revelation
[1:42:12] tomorrow we're going to think on what
[1:42:14] brother keith said and you know what
[1:42:15] something i hope sparks in your heart
[1:42:17] and gives you a new revelation
[1:42:19] gives you a new a new thought a new
[1:42:21] process
[1:42:23] and i think that's why that uh
[1:42:25] um
[1:42:26] i was telling um
[1:42:28] somebody today
[1:42:30] if you watch some of those services
[1:42:32] brother donny and brother
[1:42:33] brother ron
[1:42:35] and even brother keith on one of the the
[1:42:36] friday morning
[1:42:39] about how we've
[1:42:40] forgotten how church was important we've
[1:42:43] forgotten that
[1:42:44] that we're supposed to come to church to
[1:42:46] worship god not see each other and not
[1:42:48] to be counted present on the board
[1:42:51] amen
[1:42:52] but to what to come in here and worship
[1:42:54] god in spirit and truth not see your
[1:42:57] neighbor
[1:42:58] that's why we don't congregate inside
[1:43:00] here when it's not a lodge we go
[1:43:02] downstairs if we need to talk to
[1:43:03] somebody if you want to see somebody you
[1:43:05] see them outside
[1:43:07] because this is a
[1:43:08] place that we're here to do one thing

[1:45:07] my cross
[1:45:09] through the midnight
[1:45:13] come morning
[1:45:15] there's glory
[1:45:17] for me
[1:45:19] sometimes i'm despised
[1:45:23] and rejected if you preach the word long
[1:45:26] enough you will
[1:45:27] and i want
[1:45:29] oh father
[1:45:31] how long
[1:45:34] then i take one more look
[1:45:39] at mount calvary
[1:45:42] and it gives me
[1:45:44] the strength to
[1:45:47] go on
[1:45:49] good morning
[1:45:52] i'll walk
[1:45:54] by the river
[1:45:55] brother brown says sometime in the
[1:45:57] morning between six and nine o'clock
[1:46:00] something's gonna sweep down
[1:46:02] and it's gonna pick up his saints
[1:46:05] and we're gonna go to a marriage supper
[1:46:08] and we're gonna have joy
[1:46:10] our bodies is going to be changed in the
[1:46:12] moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:46:14] the wine is going to taste much better
[1:46:16] and so is the bread
[1:46:18] because in those glorified bodies
[1:46:20] everything is enhanced
[1:46:22] everything is greater a greater taste
[1:46:24] you know brother branham said one time
[1:46:25] he said god you know he's got an eye
[1:46:29] but a better eye than we have
[1:46:32] he's got a a brain a better brain than
[1:46:35] we have
[1:46:36] i like what as as we were talking about
[1:46:38] the other day and brother keith was
[1:46:39] bringing out in
[1:46:41] in ruth how that um
[1:46:43] the brother brown and preach christ the
[1:46:45] mystery of god revealed on the seventh
[1:46:47] month the 28th day
[1:46:50] and we were talking about last night
[1:46:52] how their brother brought him on the
[1:46:54] seventh seal you could tell he was
[1:46:55] struggling a little bit trying to trying
[1:46:57] to find the right words to say and he
[1:46:59] really wasn't he wasn't happy about it
[1:47:02] if you'll read your seal book
[1:47:04] he actually takes part of the sermon and
[1:47:07] cuts it out inside the tabernacle
[1:47:10] and goes over to a motel with two
[1:47:12] brothers and re-tapes it
[1:47:15] because he wasn't satisfied with the
[1:47:16] first time
[1:47:17] he was looking for something
[1:47:19] but oh my
[1:47:22] on july the 28th
[1:47:25] he knew
[1:47:26] what that seventh seal was
[1:47:29] which is christ in you
[1:47:31] the hope of glory
[1:47:33] christ is the mystery
[1:47:35] of god reveal
[1:47:37] he said let's go back in the back part
[1:47:38] of god's mind nobody ever been there
[1:47:40] before
[1:47:42] let's go back in the back part of god's
[1:47:43] mind and let's bring him down today
[1:47:46] and what was that whole book doing
[1:47:47] showing who you are where you came from
[1:47:50] what you're doing here and where you're
[1:47:52] going
[1:47:53] thank god for a prophet
[1:47:55] y'all people can bash him all they want
[1:47:57] to he brought me to god
[1:48:00] he gave me a revelation that no other i
[1:48:02] can't listen to no other preacher and
[1:48:03] get what i get from william branham i
[1:48:05] promise you that
[1:48:07] and then the fivefold ministry that
[1:48:08] absolutely breaks it down and and lets
[1:48:11] us know exactly that love letter brother
[1:48:14] brown gave us a big long love letter but
[1:48:17] in between that love letter we got more
[1:48:19] lines that the the fivefold ministry
[1:48:22] is
[1:48:22] saying this is what god said about you
[1:48:25] this is what god said about you
[1:48:28] this is what god said about
[1:48:31] what you
[1:48:31] blessed people we are
[1:48:33] what a group of people we've become we
[1:48:36] we um
[1:48:38] i was telling the other day brother
[1:48:39] keith we've got more musicians on the
[1:48:41] stage than we had we had congregation
[1:48:43] the first time we had we had church here
[1:48:46] a little humble beginnings of uh
[1:48:49] of uh the the pulpit was right here the
[1:48:52] window was right there the window was
[1:48:54] right here and there was a door right
[1:48:55] there that went out into the into the
[1:48:56] almost into the end of the
[1:48:58] road and the pulpit was there and there
[1:49:01] were seats sitting right here
[1:49:03] we had just a small amount of people at
[1:49:05] that time
[1:49:06] but look what it's become you preach the
[1:49:08] word of god
[1:49:10] as brother dale's done and give us a
[1:49:12] good foundation
[1:49:13] i'll promise you god's going to honor it
[1:49:16] because it won't return void it'll
[1:49:17] accomplish what it said it was going to
[1:49:19] accomplish so now generations
[1:49:21] brother keith myself different ones
[1:49:24] the generations is coming up
[1:49:26] now we take the word of god and we can
[1:49:28] preach the word of god
[1:49:30] and give it to the people like we're
[1:49:31] supposed to
[1:49:33] amen
[1:49:40] and i can remember even coming to the
[1:49:42] church brother john when we only use one
[1:49:44] of them
[1:49:45] one of those
[1:49:46] um
[1:49:48] levels is about all we used and we
[1:49:50] didn't have to use it all and here we
[1:49:51] are almost getting two
[1:49:53] so i thank god that means you're taking
[1:49:56] communion because it's clear in your
[1:49:57] mind it's clearing your soul
[1:50:00] that birth is happening
[1:50:03] because we listen
[1:50:05] we're going when we read this about the
[1:50:07] um the foot washing he told peter he
[1:50:10] looked right at peter and he said if you
[1:50:11] don't do this
[1:50:13] you have no part with me
[1:50:15] now how much clear is that that's not
[1:50:16] some that's not what brooke keith said
[1:50:18] that brother brady said that brother
[1:50:20] wade said that brother dale said no
[1:50:22] that's what god said to peter if you
[1:50:24] don't do this
[1:50:25] you ain't got no part with me and if you
[1:50:27] don't take communion in the foot washing
[1:50:29] you don't have part with god get born
[1:50:31] again and you'll want to do this you'll
[1:50:34] not want you'll not be ashamed to reach
[1:50:36] and get the cup you'll not be ashamed to
[1:50:37] reach and get the bread
[1:50:39] because you know what we're required to
[1:50:41] do that that's right god told us these
[1:50:43] things to do put it in the word made it
[1:50:45] very clear for us to take communion so
[1:50:47] let's take communion
[1:50:59] thank you lord
[1:51:01] while they're taking those up let's go
[1:51:02] ahead and read the
[1:51:04] scripture now when we're finished the
[1:51:06] sisters will go downstairs there's place
[1:51:08] provided down there for you to wash feet
[1:51:11] and then there'll be a space up here
[1:51:12] provided for the men
[1:51:15] and like i said before
[1:51:16] make sure you stay reverent
[1:51:18] oh don't go downstairs and laughing and
[1:51:20] talking
[1:51:21] until everybody's finished because it's
[1:51:23] a solemn time i don't believe they were
[1:51:24] having a party in the upper room
[1:51:26] i believe it was a solemn time jesus was
[1:51:28] getting he was within 24 hours of losing
[1:51:31] his life
[1:51:32] and he had to go to the garden
[1:51:34] afterwards
[1:51:35] so he knew that this was the last time
[1:51:38] he was going to have physical contact
[1:51:40] with
[1:51:41] his disciples
[1:51:43] and the devil was going to do what he
[1:51:45] did
[1:51:46] and and then this is what's going to
[1:51:48] happen but jesus watch what he said
[1:51:50] if you want to read along in john john
[1:51:52] chapter 13
[1:51:55] and supper being ended the devil having
[1:51:57] now put in the heart of judas this
[1:51:59] carrot simon's son to betray him
[1:52:01] jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:52:03] all things into his hands and that he
[1:52:04] was come from god
[1:52:06] and went to god he rises from supper and
[1:52:09] laid aside his garments and took towel
[1:52:12] and girded himself
[1:52:13] after that he poureth water into a basin
[1:52:16] and began to wash the disciples feet
[1:52:19] it's not gonna be that we gonna have on
[1:52:21] our izods and our
[1:52:22] and our whatever kind of socks we got on
[1:52:25] and hoes we got on and we've had nice
[1:52:28] shoes put on our feet and we've not
[1:52:29] walked 25 miles in the in the cow
[1:52:32] pasture
[1:52:33] they had
[1:52:36] the water was probably pretty dirty
[1:52:38] but jesus was going to finish what he
[1:52:40] started
[1:52:41] he didn't stop in the middle of it he
[1:52:43] washed all of his feet
[1:52:45] if he can do that
[1:52:48] so can we
[1:52:49] if god can wash feet
[1:52:51] we ought to wash each other's feet
[1:52:54] after that he poured water in the
[1:52:55] basement and began to wash the disciples
[1:52:57] feet and to wipe them with the towel who
[1:52:59] with he was girded then it cometh he to
[1:53:01] simon peter and peter said unto him lord
[1:53:04] lest thou wash my feet
[1:53:06] jesus answered and said what i do thou
[1:53:08] knowest not now
[1:53:10] but thou shalt know hereafter
[1:53:13] peter said unto him thou shalt never
[1:53:15] watch he's pretty adamant you know
[1:53:17] you're not you're never gonna wash my
[1:53:18] feet
[1:53:20] in other words i'm never gonna allow you
[1:53:21] to do this because
[1:53:23] because this is something a servant
[1:53:24] should do
[1:53:25] well jesus is fixing to tell him to tell
[1:53:28] him that he is the servant
[1:53:30] jesus answered and said if i wash thee
[1:53:33] not thou hast no part
[1:53:37] with me
[1:53:38] simon peter said unto him lord not only
[1:53:40] in my feet only but also my hands and my
[1:53:42] head
[1:53:43] jesus said to him he that is washing it
[1:53:45] is not saved to wash his feet but is
[1:53:46] clean ever wit and ye are clean but not
[1:53:49] all
[1:53:50] for he knew who should betray him
[1:53:51] therefore he said you're not all clean
[1:53:54] so after he had washed their feet and
[1:53:56] taken his garment and was set down again
[1:53:58] he said unto them
[1:53:59] know you what i've done to you
[1:54:01] is the question
[1:54:03] you call me master and lord and you say
[1:54:05] well for so i am now watch he's elevated
[1:54:08] himself i'm mastering lord you say well
[1:54:11] for so i am
[1:54:12] now watch what he done he's going to
[1:54:14] come right back down and be the servant
[1:54:17] all right if i then your lord and master
[1:54:19] have washed your feet you also ought to
[1:54:21] wash one another's feet for i have given
[1:54:23] you an example
[1:54:25] he was the example
[1:54:26] i have given you an example that you
[1:54:29] should do as i have done to you very
[1:54:32] verily i say unto you look the servant
[1:54:34] is not greater than his lord
[1:54:36] neither he that is sent
[1:54:39] greater than he that sent him if you
[1:54:41] know these things
[1:54:43] i like this
[1:54:44] happy
[1:54:46] happy
[1:54:48] if you begrudgingly wash somebody's feet
[1:54:50] you need to get in the altar all right
[1:54:53] i tell you brother tom ernest
[1:54:56] impressed me more than anything that day
[1:54:58] we were we were getting ready to wash
[1:54:59] feet and we'd never watch feet before
[1:55:00] brother clauds and
[1:55:02] he got down you know brother tom's big
[1:55:04] guy his biggest his brother donnie
[1:55:06] and uh and uh y'all just remember sister
[1:55:09] sandy because
[1:55:10] he passed away a couple of days ago one
[1:55:12] year will be a one-year anniversary he
[1:55:14] died of covet but love brother tom is
[1:55:16] the good brother and the lord we'll see
[1:55:18] him again but he looked down at me he
[1:55:20] looked up at me and he said brother wait
[1:55:21] he said it's a privilege
[1:55:25] to wash your feet
[1:55:27] can we say that it's a privilege and he
[1:55:29] meant what he was saying it's a
[1:55:30] privilege to be able to wash your feet
[1:55:32] not that i have to pick mine out and go
[1:55:35] i think i'm going to get brother donnie
[1:55:36] over there because i know his feet don't
[1:55:37] stink
[1:55:39] come on somebody
[1:55:42] i wash everybody's feet wouldn't bother
[1:55:44] me a bit amen
