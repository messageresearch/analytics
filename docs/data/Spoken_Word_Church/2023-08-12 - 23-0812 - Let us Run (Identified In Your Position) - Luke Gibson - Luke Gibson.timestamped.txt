[23:57] so good to be brother Cadence sir good
[23:59] to see you you didn't come all the way

[24:05] we certainly appreciate the Lord tonight
[24:07] if you have your Bibles let's open
[24:09] together to Hebrews chapter 12.
[24:13] you don't mind if I take his coat off
[24:18] it's hard to
[24:19] Hebrews chapter 12. I like to read two
[24:23] verses I'll just read two verses Hebrews
[24:25] 12 1 verse 1 and verse 2.
[24:30] Apostle Paul
[24:32] says wherefore seeing we are compassed
[24:35] about
[24:36] what's so great a cloud of witnesses
[24:39] let us lay aside every weight and the
[24:43] sin which does so easily beset us
[24:47] and let us run with patience the race
[24:50] that is set before us
[24:52] looking unto Jesus the author and the
[24:56] finisher of our faith
[24:58] who for the joy that was set before him
[25:01] endured the cross despising the shame
[25:04] and is set down at the right hand of the
[25:08] Throne of God Amen just bow your heads
[25:11] just a moment if you would
[25:13] father we thank you tonight Lord for the
[25:16] great privilege that you give us to be
[25:18] assembled in your divine presence
[25:21] Lord in the wonderful songs that we have
[25:23] just sang Lord just encouraged our
[25:26] hearts oh God
[25:28] and Lord we know that your Prophet
[25:29] taught us this is the most important
[25:32] part of any service is what we do with
[25:35] the word of God
[25:36] we pray tonight father that you'd come
[25:39] and that you'd anoint the word to every
[25:41] heart we know Lord that your word is
[25:44] Anointed we pray that it'll come down
[25:47] and speak to every heart to every life
[25:50] may you bless both the speaker and the
[25:52] here tonight Lord we've opened the Bible
[25:55] but we understand that any man can open
[25:58] the Bible but oh God it takes the Holy
[26:01] Spirit to make it live
[26:02] we pray tonight that you'd come father
[26:05] we just pray that you'd help us to get
[26:07] out the way may you speak to every life
[26:09] may you meet every need that's
[26:11] represented among us we pray now and the
[26:14] wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[26:15] and everyone says amen God bless you you
[26:19] may be seated
[26:22] I won't spend a lot of time introducing
[26:24] myself but
[26:25] I am Luke Gibson
[26:28] which that really don't matter
[26:30] I'm a married man I got seven kids and
[26:32] this year I have 10 grandkids
[26:35] enough said
[26:39] amen
[26:40] I want to speak tonight if I could for a
[26:43] few moments
[26:44] on a subject that's been dear to me over
[26:46] the last few years I preached in several
[26:49] places but when brother Wade called me
[26:51] the other day just a little thought come
[26:53] on my heart and you sometimes you just
[26:55] better to obey the Lord
[26:57] I'd like to take the subject tonight let
[26:59] us run
[27:01] very simple let us run
[27:04] now I'm a Believer tonight that this
[27:07] Bible
[27:08] is our absolute
[27:11] when we live in a world like we live in
[27:14] tonight we realize we live in a time
[27:16] that people don't want an absolute right
[27:20] but I believe that this Bible right here
[27:22] is God's infallible word
[27:26] and God did give us an absolute and his
[27:29] word is our absolute
[27:32] men change time changes churches change
[27:37] preachers change but God's word never
[27:41] changes it's forever settled and will
[27:44] always remain the word of God
[27:47] I want to bring this up but I had a
[27:49] fella that's been texting me and he's
[27:52] been carrying on conversations with me
[27:54] and a lot that he says sounds good
[27:57] and I said brother out of the greatest
[27:59] respect I could have for you what you
[28:01] say sounds good but I can't find it in
[28:05] the word
[28:07] and I said we live in a time that people
[28:09] chase after a lot of sensation a lot of
[28:12] things
[28:12] and something that might tickle their
[28:14] ears I said but I'm far beyond that now
[28:17] I said what we say has got to come out
[28:19] of the Bible
[28:21] I believe when God sent us a prophet and
[28:23] I do believe he sent one and I believe
[28:26] this prophets Vindicated by almighty God
[28:29] but I even believe brother Brown's
[28:31] message has got to come back to the
[28:32] Bible I believe it does come back to the
[28:34] Bible I don't believe God sent us a
[28:37] prophet to take us away from the word he
[28:39] said it's the prophet to bring us back
[28:40] to the word of God
[28:43] I heard this message when I was 18 years
[28:45] old and the Pentecostal won this
[28:48] Apostolic Church an attempt meeting in
[28:51] Tipton Georgia I'm 52 years old tonight
[28:53] almost 53 and from my congregation I'll
[28:56] be 53 on the 25th so don't forget that
[29:03] I've been listening this prophet and I
[29:05] got to be honest with you brother Wade
[29:06] I've never found nowhere on this message
[29:09] contrary to the scriptures
[29:11] not getting to something tonight that
[29:13] might offend some people but I do
[29:14] believe that our Prophet had a
[29:16] progressive understanding amen
[29:18] amen I believe he groaned in Christ just
[29:20] like we grow in Christ he didn't come
[29:23] out of his mother's womb with a full
[29:24] understanding of who God was but he
[29:27] growed in grace and the knowledge of God
[29:28] now I believe if he had to do that we
[29:30] got to do the same tonight
[29:33] but you know I was thinking of that for
[29:35] a little bit on Paul talking about let
[29:38] us run
[29:39] and when I look at the scriptures on you
[29:41] know you you was a sports man I was a
[29:43] sports man and secretly I I don't tell
[29:46] it but I still sort of am
[29:48] just a little
[29:51] and when I read the Bible I'm shocked at
[29:54] how much natural things typed out
[29:56] spiritual things
[29:59] the Apostle Paul was one of the greatest
[30:01] at taking metaphors and acknowledges and
[30:05] just natural things of life and showing
[30:07] the spiritual activity of the work of
[30:09] God in a man's life
[30:11] brother Bannon was the same way took a
[30:13] lot of natural things to express things
[30:15] over in the spiritual realm because the
[30:17] natural types the spiritual matter of
[30:20] fact brother banham taught us that God's
[30:22] first Bible before we ever had this
[30:24] written word he could look at nature and
[30:26] see God
[30:27] God's in nature he's in his word and
[30:30] he's also in his people
[30:32] but one of the things that the Apostle
[30:33] Paul used was the human body
[30:36] what you think about this man he used
[30:39] the human body and over in Corinthians
[30:41] he talks about the human body and he
[30:44] would type it with the spiritual body of
[30:46] Christ
[30:47] he would say things like this can the
[30:49] hand say the foot I have no need of thee
[30:52] and what he should be taking is one body
[30:55] that all has to function together
[30:58] and one part of the body can't say to
[31:00] another part of the body I don't have no
[31:02] use of you I don't know about you but I
[31:05] love my feet
[31:07] and after this service I'm gonna love my
[31:09] hands
[31:13] and I'm certainly gonna love my mouth
[31:15] and Saul's head down my love my belly
[31:19] I like this human body that's right but
[31:22] this human body is a type of the
[31:25] spiritual body of Christ
[31:27] and we find out that Paul and I just
[31:30] want to lay this little foundation for a
[31:32] minute lays out the body and how it
[31:34] functions and Compares it to the
[31:37] spiritual position of every believer
[31:40] that's in Christ
[31:42] and so when he talks about it he begins
[31:45] to show a certain positions of the body
[31:48] and each position that he would talk
[31:51] about
[31:52] represents something that God that he
[31:55] said this way the spiritual activity of
[31:58] the holy ghost in a man's life I tell
[32:01] you that God is still at work in his
[32:03] people
[32:05] I don't care how far this thing goes
[32:07] God's gonna have somebody on Earth
[32:09] that's going to represent him and he's
[32:11] going to have somebody on there that he
[32:13] still works through
[32:16] he ain't right off out there somewhere
[32:18] he's right here with us tonight
[32:21] and so he talks about the position of
[32:23] our body now a minute ago
[32:24] y'all were standing right
[32:27] right now I'm standing I was sitting and
[32:29] y'all was standing now I got to stand
[32:32] over the next few moments and you've got
[32:34] to sit
[32:36] and we outstanding and then we have
[32:38] sitting and two different positions but
[32:42] both of those positions represent
[32:44] something in the spiritual body of
[32:47] Christ
[32:48] let me just go on just for a minute no
[32:51] matter what action our body is operating
[32:54] in even a change of natural possession
[32:57] it's expressing something about our
[33:00] spiritual position
[33:02] now let me show you the body I'm
[33:04] referring to
[33:05] because when I refer the spiritual body
[33:07] I'm not necessarily talking about this
[33:10] there's a spiritual body that every man
[33:12] and woman in here is a part of
[33:15] and that spiritual body is called the
[33:17] spiritual body of Christ
[33:20] so whatever he's doing we're doing
[33:22] whatever his action is there is our
[33:25] actions are here
[33:27] let me show you what happens when Jesus
[33:29] dies
[33:30] and raise as a gift he died for our sins
[33:34] he raised right justification thank God
[33:37] we still have a Risen Lord tonight you
[33:40] don't have to die no more he died once
[33:43] for sin that's it he live it now unto
[33:45] God
[33:46] I and you I represented in what his body
[33:51] did
[33:54] but I said when he went to Calgary we
[33:56] went with him
[33:58] when he died we died
[34:00] when he was buried we were buried and
[34:03] when he ascended we ascended with him
[34:05] now watch this and we sat together in
[34:09] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[34:12] but guess what Ephesians chapter one I'm
[34:14] hurrying now blessed be the god father
[34:17] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[34:19] who hath blessed us with all all
[34:23] spiritual blessings
[34:25] in Heavenly places notice this now in
[34:29] Christ Jesus
[34:31] now there could be heavily places here
[34:33] tonight and there is
[34:35] but they don't mean anything to you if
[34:38] you ain't in Christ
[34:41] now listen brother bear said when he'll
[34:42] sin he goes further and he tells us now
[34:45] watch that that Heavenly place
[34:48] is your position in Christ
[34:55] did he reach he comes he features two
[34:57] unless what it says and he raised us up
[35:00] together
[35:01] and made us sit together
[35:05] in Heavenly places in Christ now that
[35:07] don't mean when this physical body every
[35:10] time you want to get in Christ you have
[35:11] to go sit down that's talking about what
[35:13] he did right
[35:15] the prophet said when he ascended on
[35:17] high he sat down
[35:20] and him setting down was a sign that the
[35:24] work was finished
[35:26] let me say it tonight if you're
[35:28] identified with him the work for your
[35:30] salvation is completed you don't have to
[35:32] do nothing Christ already did it and we
[35:35] sit with him
[35:36] so his position
[35:39] it speaks something about our position
[35:42] in Christ
[35:45] now let's see closely
[35:47] our location
[35:49] can change
[35:51] and even the people that when Paul is
[35:53] writing Ephesians 1 he don't say to the
[35:57] Saints who are in Lula
[35:59] he don't say to the Saints who are in
[36:01] Townville he says to the saints that are
[36:04] in Ephesus
[36:05] so the location that he's writing us to
[36:08] it's the Believers that are in Ephesus
[36:12] but then he says after the faithful
[36:15] in Christ Jesus so it wouldn't matter
[36:19] tonight if I read this in Lula if it's
[36:21] to those that's in Christ Jesus I don't
[36:24] have to be in their location as long as
[36:26] I'm in their position
[36:27] [Applause]
[36:30] come on church after 2 000 years you and
[36:34] I are in the same position that the
[36:36] church was 2 000 years ago we're sitting
[36:39] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[36:43] now watch I gotta go on now
[36:46] it's not necessary
[36:48] that we be in the same location to those
[36:51] to whom the letter was written to
[36:54] right a few years ago I went with
[36:55] brother George Smith me and a few
[36:57] brothers from the church and
[36:59] we went to Israel
[37:02] we went to the upper room and
[37:04] Benny Hinn had a crowd there
[37:07] and they were all in the upper room
[37:09] supposed to be in the physical
[37:12] location at the early church got the
[37:14] Holy Ghost
[37:15] there's no scripture that tells me
[37:18] physically I have to be in the same
[37:20] location
[37:22] I just got to meet the same conditions
[37:25] and when I meet the same conditions God
[37:28] will baptize me in the same position
[37:30] that that early church was in
[37:32] now watch what I'm saying because
[37:35] even though the letter was not written
[37:37] to us
[37:38] but it's written to everyone
[37:41] who's in that same position
[37:44] setting in Heavenly places in Christ
[37:48] Jesus now watch Ephesus
[37:51] what's their location
[37:53] in Christ what's their position
[37:57] now tonight your location is
[38:01] but your position is in Christ
[38:05] tonight my location is going to change
[38:08] I'm going back to Westminster tomorrow
[38:11] I'll be in Townville but you know the
[38:13] same position I'm in right now I'll be
[38:16] in that tomorrow when I'm standing In a
[38:17] Pulpit it's in Christ some of you may go
[38:20] back to Paul Mercer hear Lula and
[38:22] tomorrow you'll come back here when you
[38:24] leave here and go home your position
[38:26] hasn't changed your location changes but
[38:29] never your possession now let me tell
[38:32] you this your position your location can
[38:35] never change your position but one day
[38:37] our position is going to change our
[38:40] location
[38:40] [Applause]
[38:48] one over here one over there because no
[38:51] matter where we're at in the world if
[38:52] we're in Christ we're in the same
[38:54] position at that position one day is
[38:57] going to change our location
[39:00] can you say praise the Lord
[39:03] that's why
[39:05] I don't tell people they got to go to a
[39:07] certain Church
[39:08] just get in Christ
[39:10] you get in Christ he'll lead you where
[39:12] to go to church
[39:15] this might not be popular but
[39:18] I believe if you're in Christ you'll go
[39:21] to church
[39:24] I said the other night holy ghost fill
[39:26] people up to go to church
[39:28] your position pushes you to that
[39:31] now listen
[39:32] so like Paul the Apostle
[39:35] look at him where'd he spend when he
[39:38] wrote these letters you realize that man
[39:40] he wasn't brother Wade like you and I
[39:42] maybe sitting in the air conditioned
[39:44] office
[39:45] I told somebody that I said God couldn't
[39:47] have called me to be the mess of the age
[39:49] I couldn't have been a message I wasn't
[39:50] nature that way
[39:52] I'll tell you now I'm not going to no
[39:54] cave at three o'clock in the morning
[39:59] waiting on an angel or whatever if he
[40:02] dance with me it's gonna be in my
[40:03] bedroom or the Holiday Inn
[40:06] I'm just not cut out that way but God
[40:10] had to cut his man out the way he wanted
[40:11] him to
[40:12] brother Madam talks about that cave
[40:14] going on in the candle they say they
[40:16] found it I'm not saying they haven't but
[40:17] I'm saying when I've seen them squeezing
[40:19] through them two rocks and get down now
[40:21] I said I'm glad he was the messenger
[40:23] because I ain't going there
[40:27] God Moses man the way he wants him
[40:30] the Apostle Paul
[40:32] when he went to where his office was
[40:34] where a lot of these letters were
[40:36] inspired from was down in the jailhouse
[40:40] now I've spent one night in jail and I
[40:43] wasn't called of God to go to the jails
[40:46] judge told me he said preacher maybe
[40:47] this will Lord I said no sir I ain't
[40:49] coming to save him you let him out then
[40:51] we'll get them saved
[40:54] I said I'm not I'm not no jail bird
[40:56] unless I had to do it for the cause of
[40:58] Christ but let me just tell you this
[41:00] Paul when he was down in Rome in a
[41:03] prison cell and he wrote his letters he
[41:05] didn't say hi Paul a prisoner of Rome
[41:10] his location was in the jail but his
[41:13] position was in Christ
[41:14] [Applause]
[41:19] a prisoner of Jesus Christ he was
[41:23] identified with his possession
[41:28] to notice he never one time in the Bible
[41:30] ever called himself Apostle Paul
[41:32] it was Paul the Apostle because back in
[41:35] that day a title a name in front of your
[41:38] name was a title but after your name was
[41:42] a position
[41:45] hey he was an apostle by possession he
[41:49] was an apostle by predestination
[41:52] nobody laid hands on him to make him an
[41:54] apostle he was called of God from his
[41:56] mother's womb to be an apostle man just
[41:58] like you're called to be a believer
[42:00] you're called to be a Christian or an
[42:02] evangelist or this or that every man in
[42:03] his got a position in Christ nobody can
[42:06] give that oh I'm gonna say it nobody can
[42:09] give it to you nobody can take it from
[42:10] you that's predestinated by almighty God
[42:13] [Applause]
[42:16] and the reason some people ain't happy
[42:18] with it that's because you always
[42:19] comparing yourself to somebody else God
[42:22] made one you and nobody can be you just
[42:25] be who God Made You
[42:28] listen position can never change
[42:31] let me tell you why because
[42:33] possession is
[42:35] eternal security
[42:37] now I know what the prophet of God said
[42:39] I've been around long enough to know
[42:41] that people run out on both extremes
[42:45] and brother M taught us both extremes
[42:47] the prophet was so wonderful the way he
[42:50] had balanced things up for us
[42:52] I mean you've been this mess long enough
[42:53] no sometimes you get pushed over this
[42:55] side and if you're not careful and you
[42:57] get influenced by too many people that
[42:58] push you away over here and then then in
[43:00] fact this crowd's pulling on you
[43:01] especially when you're a young preacher
[43:03] they pull you on this side and after a
[43:05] while God really gets a hold of you you
[43:07] appreciate all of them but you come
[43:09] right back to the middle of the road
[43:10] and that's where God wants us
[43:13] that's where we ought to be
[43:15] let everything washed up or let's stay
[43:16] right in the middle of this message
[43:18] there's people that holding what is word
[43:20] word no spirit
[43:22] that is a bunch of one Spirit screaming
[43:24] holiday ain't got no words I believe we
[43:26] can have both of them
[43:28] we can have the word anointing people
[43:30] under the spirit amen and that's what
[43:32] you see the results
[43:34] hey your position will go to work then
[43:37] you believe that same man
[43:40] now this evening we come
[43:43] and this is really the theme just first
[43:45] just for a few moments
[43:46] I can't preach too long I got to preach
[43:48] tomorrow
[43:50] I'm not 20 years old no more
[43:53] I done said the other night I've done
[43:54] crept over the top of the hill there
[43:58] this is to those listen that are in
[44:01] Christ
[44:03] you're in Christ because you're sitting
[44:04] in this church now I'm believing you are
[44:06] but I'm just telling you people come to
[44:08] church they hate in Christ but I've been
[44:10] quoted over and over and over and over
[44:12] by one spirit
[44:14] that's right not the one Doctrine not
[44:15] but one theology not but somebody's pet
[44:17] teaching by one Holy Ghost baptism
[44:19] that's how we get into Christ
[44:23] that's what should be taught to every
[44:24] young person you've got to be born again
[44:30] listen
[44:32] now when we speak just for a minute for
[44:34] these metaphors
[44:36] because that's what they are they're
[44:37] metaphors just natural things to teach
[44:39] us something about the spiritual
[44:43] so when he talks about the body and
[44:45] certain activities of it or possessions
[44:47] of it speaking of something over in the
[44:49] spiritual room let me give you an
[44:50] example
[44:50] he says number one I talked about it we
[44:52] sit
[44:53] in Heavenly places
[44:55] every man that's here tonight I don't
[44:58] care nothing wrong with it but I don't
[45:01] care if you get a goosebump down your
[45:02] back that's nothing to do with your
[45:04] position
[45:06] that means you might have emotion
[45:07] emotions is wonderful I'm an emotional
[45:09] but I love emotions I got seven kids I'm
[45:11] emotional
[45:15] I get a lot of grandkids around my house
[45:17] and they get on my nerves and I get
[45:19] emotional
[45:20] I said it's time for y'all to go home
[45:23] I said now before you do come in the
[45:25] kitchen I want to give you some
[45:26] chocolate and candy and ice cream and
[45:28] then go home and you torment them the
[45:31] way they tormented me
[45:34] amen
[45:38] I believe in Emotion but I never never
[45:41] judge the word of God by my emotions
[45:44] as a matter of fact I don't even judge
[45:46] the word of God by my experiences I
[45:49] judge my experiences by the word of God
[45:51] by the way there's been a lot of times I
[45:53] had some really good thoughts go through
[45:54] my mind glory to God and yet the best
[45:56] thing well that ain't what he said
[46:01] I felt emotion about it people they
[46:03] don't like this but if it's conjure the
[46:05] words
[46:07] lay it down on how emotional makes you I
[46:10] believe in Emotion don't get me wrong
[46:11] but I believe your experiences and all
[46:14] your emotions you've got to take them
[46:15] back to the word of God
[46:17] now look in Heavenly places your
[46:19] position now
[46:20] that you notice all he also told us that
[46:23] we must walk
[46:25] in the light
[46:27] now to walk you got to get up
[46:30] you got to get out of your shedding
[46:31] possession and you got to walk at
[46:33] sitting and walking is two different
[46:34] positions and they express two different
[46:36] truths about the Holy Ghost working in
[46:39] your life
[46:41] then he not only taught us to walk he
[46:43] also taught us to stand
[46:46] Ephesians 6 this is all right of
[46:48] Ephesians he taught us to stand having
[46:50] done all therefore stand and I can show
[46:52] the same Lord Jesus that went to heaven
[46:55] and sat
[46:56] one day Stephen was being stoned and the
[46:59] heavens were opened and he didn't say I
[47:01] see the son of man sitting I see the
[47:04] Monster Man Standing
[47:06] and the promise said why was he standing
[47:08] he was standing up for his church that
[47:10] was under persecution
[47:13] different possession
[47:15] shedding walking standing all different
[47:18] but they all Express a spiritual truth
[47:20] about the body of Christ
[47:22] now tonight
[47:23] is on running
[47:26] and I know someone you'd rather sit than
[47:28] run
[47:30] I can look at you and tell that
[47:33] you've been sitting a whole lot more
[47:35] than you've been running
[47:38] even walking
[47:41] don't get mad at me now I'm just kidding
[47:43] you don't even like to stand that long
[47:46] not when you sat so long and you change
[47:48] your body structure you don't like to
[47:49] stand so long either
[47:51] this stuff hurts my feet
[47:56] I'm not saying that to be offensive I'm
[47:59] getting to a point
[48:05] for expressing something about a truth
[48:07] concerning the Holy Ghost working in
[48:09] your life
[48:12] says what is that the work's finished
[48:14] I don't like it but look brother I come
[48:16] out of a group that had Works before
[48:18] faith
[48:20] Works before Faith leads men to legalism
[48:23] and they think there's something they
[48:25] can do to make themselves acceptable God
[48:27] but let's say there's not one thing you
[48:29] can do
[48:30] it's already been done
[48:32] you just got a set in Christ relax if
[48:35] the work is already done if God's called
[48:38] you Satan can't take you you belong to
[48:41] Christ
[48:43] I know it's hard but you can't be lost
[48:45] no more than God can be lost
[48:48] your salvation is secure
[48:51] the work is finished he cried it out it
[48:54] is finished
[48:56] took his body and put it in the ground
[48:59] he his body went to the Grave
[49:02] says the real part of him went somewhere
[49:04] else
[49:06] but on Resurrection morning God didn't
[49:08] leave that body in a grave it didn't go
[49:11] back to the 16 elements God raised that
[49:13] body up it was the Redemptive body of
[49:15] Jehovah God
[49:17] and he raised Jesus up and he sets the
[49:20] night in the presence of God
[49:21] representing you and I
[49:23] [Applause]
[49:24] even told the brothers on the way to
[49:25] church I heard Brothers say the other
[49:27] day when you're in Christ and you pray
[49:28] and you pray through the blood it's the
[49:30] same as Jesus praying to the father
[49:34] Brother people could ever understand
[49:35] their position in Christ
[49:38] that when you pray to the blood it's the
[49:40] voice of Jesus praying to the father
[49:41] it's the same as him speaking
[49:44] you believe that
[49:45] now the work's finished
[49:47] so I didn't do it no you didn't do it
[49:49] but you are in the body that did it
[49:52] that's the key look do you realize how
[49:54] much condemnation I could wipe out of
[49:57] our churches by getting the people to
[49:59] put their eyes on the one that belongs
[50:00] on it don't belong on you don't belong
[50:03] to me your eyes belong on Christ and
[50:05] when you listen what I said the other
[50:06] day I said when I look at myself I don't
[50:09] know how I can be saved but when I look
[50:11] at him I don't know how I can be lost
[50:17] it's about him your mind's got to be on
[50:21] Christ
[50:23] he's the one that finished the work with
[50:25] the utmost respect and I'll come to
[50:27] that's more respect I have for our
[50:28] messenger and I believe in that I do I
[50:31] do but brother bam didn't die for my
[50:33] sins Christ died for our sins
[50:35] your eyes have got to be all priced
[50:41] listen walk not just sit now walk what
[50:45] does that really mean it means simply
[50:47] this progression
[50:50] don't you dare walk if he don't give you
[50:52] something to walk in you stay right
[50:54] where you're at
[50:56] no the Bible said walk in the light and
[51:00] if God don't open light stand right
[51:01] where you are just stand there and wait
[51:04] you try to force it in you'll find
[51:06] yourself out there in darkness somewhere
[51:08] stay with the light
[51:11] anybody ever heard of Brother Richard
[51:12] Blair did you ever know anybody ever
[51:14] know him brother Mike I knew him in
[51:16] Arkansas one of the finest men I knew

[51:35] was there in the United Pentecostal

[51:39] later got a hold of Billy Paul and he
[51:41] said he said he said Billy would you ask
[51:44] brother Branham if I should come out of
[51:45] the United Pentecostal Church
[51:47] and his brother random said no said you

[53:15] out
[53:15] [Applause]
[53:17] walk in this life
[53:25] yes sir I'm gonna talk about that just a
[53:28] minute because I've got that's what I
[53:29] tell my brother here before service tell
[53:31] brother wait I said brother Wade I got a
[53:33] lot of Pentecostal Brothers
[53:35] and one in particular we're talking
[53:37] about before service and I have he
[53:38] doesn't see what I see they don't even
[53:39] see the message he ain't gonna condemn
[53:41] his brother bam for being a prophet but
[53:42] he's going to see his message
[53:44] don't don't get mad I had him preach for
[53:47] me
[53:47] he gonna hurt me all right if I've
[53:50] taught my people correctly he ain't
[53:51] gonna hurt my people
[53:52] I want him to see what this message has
[53:55] produced
[53:57] he came and preached for us
[53:59] and he told me he said look
[54:01] I I'll admit to you he said that's what
[54:02] he said the Pentecostals don't want the
[54:04] word they want my gift I said I know my
[54:06] brother I know I said but he said I've
[54:09] never seen a crowd like this that loves
[54:11] the word I said brother just give us the
[54:14] word
[54:14] so we got to talk and I went down to
[54:16] Norristown Georgia one time heard him
[54:18] sitting in this little camper there and
[54:19] I walked in his tears rolling down his
[54:21] face I said brother what's wrong he said
[54:23] brother Luke these people don't want the
[54:25] word I said I almost called his name I
[54:27] said brother that's what I've been
[54:29] telling you for a long time but I know a
[54:31] group that wants it amen
[54:34] has he come out no he can't come out
[54:37] cause I tell him hey he can only come
[54:39] when God calls him look I don't condemn
[54:42] the brother he's my brother I love him
[54:44] and I pray to God he's somewhere I look
[54:47] I don't care if God calls him on his
[54:48] deathbed give him as much grace on his
[54:50] deathbed that you gave me at 18 years
[54:52] old
[54:53] I'm not standing with this Grace I want
[54:56] God to give it to everybody
[55:01] he was in the hospital the other day
[55:04] who does his family call they call me
[55:06] they know I love that man they know that
[55:09] man loves me but he don't see the
[55:11] message
[55:12] but does that mean I got to disrespect
[55:14] him no
[55:15] I pray for him
[55:17] God opened his eyes because I know if
[55:20] God ever has opened his eyes there'll be
[55:22] something to happen to him that happened
[55:23] all to you you'll hear a voice that says
[55:25] come out of her my people be your
[55:28] separate Chef the Lord and your body
[55:30] will do what that voice tells you to do
[55:33] [Applause]
[55:38] so we we walk
[55:41] means progression I know people get mad
[55:43] at it I don't care what I can take the
[55:45] by the very messy itself and prove to
[55:47] you that brother random walked in late
[55:50] but that's things he preach after still
[55:52] I show you but he didn't preach that
[55:53] same thing before the seals but he can
[55:55] only preach on the line he had
[55:57] but when look it's like brother Benham
[55:59] what was brother Benham he wasn't even
[56:01] he didn't even have the light when he
[56:03] first started out of some of y'all had
[56:04] yeah right
[56:07] some of y'all were Pentecostal
[56:09] Pentecostals further than the Baptist
[56:10] right
[56:12] right you know the pen you know what a
[56:14] Baptist is the Baptist is still not
[56:16] going to start the title before that
[56:18] little blood brings for that missionary
[56:19] age John Smith and those men that's
[56:21] where brother Ben came to Christ at
[56:27] but when God when he went down that
[56:28] little Pentecostal meeting yeah right
[56:31] remember yes God started dealing with
[56:33] him that Pentecostal church I've always
[56:36] wondered why did God why did he just
[56:37] bypass he couldn't he had to travel with
[56:39] a life went at that time the light was
[56:42] in the shock
[56:47] the ship protected the son of man
[56:50] Ministry and its empathy
[56:53] called an evil shock it was a good shock
[56:56] he said but it served its time
[56:58] [Music]
[57:00] look if God would have took brother
[57:01] banham and brought him from that tassel
[57:03] straight into the seed he would have
[57:05] broken the continent of his own word
[57:07] cause a seed don't come out the tussle
[57:09] the seed comes out of the shock so he
[57:12] had to bring brother Ben to the
[57:13] Pentecostal age
[57:14] God was so serious about that brother
[57:17] I'm walking that light that he even took
[57:19] his wife and his baby
[57:21] right
[57:23] you should have never let your
[57:25] mother-in-law talk against my people
[57:28] you know who God's people was where the
[57:30] light was it was in that Pentecostal age
[57:33] there's gonna be Pentecostal people's
[57:35] one by the way the grave coming up in
[57:36] that Resurrection they're going to be
[57:37] your brothers and sisters in Christ
[57:41] yes sir I got old grandma I know she
[57:44] sealed in under that Pentecostal age
[57:46] come to my church but never could truly
[57:48] see what we preach I believe she sealed
[57:50] in under that Pentecostal age
[57:52] she walked in the light that God
[57:54] revealed to her
[57:58] so what happened
[58:00] God brings us property That Shook age
[58:01] they protect him yep that as his
[58:05] ministry began to grow from the first
[58:06] pool second pool
[58:09] now this very same problem that they
[58:11] love to hear him call people's names and
[58:14] prophesy and tell this and tell that and
[58:16] no it was never wrong when they had to
[58:18] turn and prophesy against the very shook
[58:19] that protected him all them years that
[58:21] became a different thing and they began
[58:23] to pull away
[58:24] and when the shot pulled away it brought
[58:26] that seed right into the presence
[58:28] of the Sun
[58:31] William random was walking into light
[58:33] you're walking in the light
[58:35] hey this scene ain't going back down on
[58:38] the ground
[58:39] right we're not repeating John 12 24
[58:41] we're in seed time this is bright time
[58:44] this is Rapture time the next thing
[58:46] we're going to hear is that combine come
[58:47] by it's going to sweep that wheat gonna
[58:50] throw it up in the air and while it's in
[58:51] the ass Gonna Change us from mortality
[58:53] immortality
[58:58] but we gotta walk in the light
[59:03] brother Branham grew
[59:05] we got to grow
[59:07] now after you walk for a while then
[59:09] after a while you're going to come
[59:10] through some things you have to learn
[59:11] how to stand
[59:13] your ground
[59:15] don't back up
[59:17] this ain't called the bread of
[59:18] Affliction for nothing
[59:19] you're going to be tested for what you
[59:21] believe but when you have done all the
[59:23] stand stand there for and then he'll
[59:25] tell you what you're girded with whole
[59:27] arm of God fighting the greatest battle
[59:29] ever fought but you stand for the word
[59:31] you stand for him he'll stand for you
[59:35] now we come to
[59:37] run
[59:39] you gotta run I'm running is more
[59:41] intense
[59:42] more exertion it speaks more of striving
[59:46] this has to do with let me just say it
[59:48] like this running
[59:50] the race of faith
[59:53] let me tell you why I say that because
[59:55] that's what really the whole book of
[59:56] Hebrews is about
[59:58] Paul writing to the Hebrews to tell them
[1:00:00] that no longer had to be Hebrews
[1:00:02] Hebrews ain't what you do with your
[1:00:04] coffee
[1:00:07] nah
[1:00:08] nah
[1:00:10] they'll get it tomorrow
[1:00:13] y'all we're in Georgia
[1:00:18] a lot of South Carolinians here too and
[1:00:20] y'all heard me say it before and you
[1:00:21] still didn't catch it
[1:00:25] laughs
[1:00:27] now this speaks of writing the race with
[1:00:30] endurance
[1:00:32] let me tell you why this is on my heart
[1:00:34] let's take a few truths or metaphors to
[1:00:37] consider this truth of us running taking
[1:00:39] hold of this message and running with it
[1:00:42] run now people some people run from
[1:00:45] something
[1:00:47] others run to something
[1:00:49] and then some run for something
[1:00:54] Joseph ran from Potiphar's wife
[1:00:57] I'm glad your boy should run
[1:01:00] she got his coat but never his character
[1:01:06] I show you the Bible which we all have
[1:01:08] done where men ran to Jesus
[1:01:12] oh that's the best place I know to run
[1:01:14] when you're in trouble run to Jesus he's
[1:01:17] a strong and mighty Tire the righteous
[1:01:19] run into and they're safe
[1:01:23] but then there's some that run for
[1:01:25] something he said well what are you
[1:01:26] running for well it's shooting
[1:01:28] popularity if you're running for
[1:01:30] popularity you're in the wrong message
[1:01:34] that's right we're running for something
[1:01:36] but what are we running for listen
[1:01:38] here's what we're really running for
[1:01:39] we're running for a prize
[1:01:44] this is the Bible I'm just talking about
[1:01:45] the Bible now
[1:01:46] you're running to obtain something
[1:01:49] and why do you run up tank you're
[1:01:51] running to obtain an Incorruptible crown
[1:01:55] brother when I think of the people out
[1:01:57] here that are Runners and these
[1:01:58] marathons and I see what they do to
[1:02:01] bring their body and subject to the
[1:02:02] runner race I think oh God where are we
[1:02:05] at spiritually
[1:02:09] I just preaching the other night
[1:02:11] on Paul's saying when he come to the end
[1:02:13] of this road I fought a good fight I
[1:02:16] finished my course henceforth had laid
[1:02:18] up for me a crown of writing Brethren
[1:02:19] said not all together a crown like a
[1:02:21] goat Crown your head but to be crowned
[1:02:23] with righteousness he said a body
[1:02:25] without sin
[1:02:29] we're talking about a new body
[1:02:31] I'm running to get out
[1:02:36] get out to another one
[1:02:39] this one's I didn't know this one could
[1:02:41] give you so much trouble
[1:02:44] and he's telling me to wait
[1:02:49] your brother's ever had kidney stones
[1:02:53] yeah
[1:02:54] nurse told me one night said you know
[1:02:56] what happened to kidney stone is much
[1:02:57] like having a baby I never had one of
[1:02:59] those
[1:03:00] she said I have
[1:03:01] and I've had a kidney stone and the pain
[1:03:04] is much like I said that's the case now
[1:03:05] as a woman my husband only had one baby
[1:03:09] that have been it
[1:03:11] I might have been divorced but there'd
[1:03:12] be one baby
[1:03:15] unless unless he loves me enough give me
[1:03:18] one of them long needles
[1:03:20] you sit there and laugh while babies are
[1:03:22] coming out
[1:03:24] that ain't God's way
[1:03:27] I'm talking about spiritually I'm not
[1:03:29] condemning you I'm just saying there's
[1:03:31] birth pains
[1:03:34] everybody say Amen
[1:03:36] now Paul is writing this race of Faith
[1:03:38] let me get to the race of faith
[1:03:40] he's trying look at the crowd he's
[1:03:42] preaching to he's preaching the ground
[1:03:44] he even says something one day you did
[1:03:46] run wild
[1:03:49] but what's him to do
[1:03:51] you say race of Faith yeah he said you
[1:03:53] did run Rebels having begun the spirit
[1:03:55] now you think you're made perfect for
[1:03:57] the flesh received you the Spirit by The
[1:03:59] Works of law or by the hearing of faith
[1:04:04] he spends the previous chapter riding on
[1:04:07] the great Heroes of Faith
[1:04:09] I mean starts with Abel and goes all the
[1:04:11] way through
[1:04:12] he gets to the 10th chapter verse 38 any
[1:04:16] man draw back my soul had no pleasure
[1:04:18] then go through all the heroes of the
[1:04:20] faith and come to chapter 12 and say now
[1:04:21] we're surrounded by a great cloud of
[1:04:23] wind I just preached them to you
[1:04:25] chapter 11 is your great cloud of
[1:04:27] witnesses amen
[1:04:29] are you going to see something just a
[1:04:30] minute but he never admonishes us to
[1:04:33] watch the cloud of witnesses
[1:04:36] he's just telling you other men has ran
[1:04:39] before you and if they can make it you
[1:04:41] can make it but you've got to keep your
[1:04:43] eyes on the same thing they have their
[1:04:44] eyes on
[1:04:48] I'm gonna get ahead of myself but we
[1:04:50] ain't looking the preachers he said
[1:04:52] looking unto Jesus
[1:04:54] your eyes have got to be on Christ you
[1:04:56] put them on anything else you're going
[1:04:57] to stumble
[1:04:59] you're going to fall by the wayside
[1:05:01] you're gonna get tired you're gonna get
[1:05:03] wore out
[1:05:05] let me go on
[1:05:07] he's bringing these because Paul whole
[1:05:09] theme of his mission I've been preaching
[1:05:11] it back home been on a couple weeks now
[1:05:13] on the book of Hebrews in chapter one
[1:05:15] it's the great exaltation of Jesus
[1:05:17] Christ
[1:05:18] he is magnifying Jesus in the eyes of
[1:05:21] these people and the reason for that is
[1:05:22] it's because they looked at a lot of
[1:05:25] other shadows and symbols and different
[1:05:27] things he said but every one of those
[1:05:28] shadowed symbols has all been fulfilled
[1:05:31] in one man
[1:05:32] and that one man is Jesus
[1:05:34] now you ask me do I believe in a one-man
[1:05:36] message you better believe I do
[1:05:39] and that one man's called Jesus Christ
[1:05:42] yes I do you say what about brother
[1:05:45] Branham it's not brother Branham it's
[1:05:46] Christ
[1:05:49] it ain't even you it's Christ we ain't
[1:05:51] nothing that's got to be Christ this
[1:05:53] ain't me it's Christ
[1:05:55] the gospel is not about us it's about
[1:05:57] Christ
[1:06:01] I've heard some preachers preach
[1:06:03] well I'll just leave it alone
[1:06:06] they preach more about a woman they do
[1:06:08] Jesus
[1:06:10] this ain't the gospel of the bride of
[1:06:11] Christ The Gospel Christ
[1:06:13] he just married a bride Christ is what
[1:06:16] should be preached
[1:06:18] now listen every believer
[1:06:21] that's in this race
[1:06:24] you are running for your life
[1:06:28] let me Express a little bit running top

[1:07:02] boys

[1:07:56] that was the next move
[1:08:05] uh some of you didn't like that
[1:08:10] and that's the Holy Ghost Field
[1:08:16] but everybody here now this that
[1:08:18] worrying ain't just for boys or girls
[1:08:20] it's both men and women but we're all in
[1:08:23] one body where he says there's neither
[1:08:25] male nor female
[1:08:28] but we're all one in Christ Jesus
[1:08:31] my wife's gotta run
[1:08:34] your brother's wives gotta run you women
[1:08:37] your husbands have got it everybody's
[1:08:39] gotta run
[1:08:40] you're in the look and that's why I say
[1:08:42] that if I give up my wife needs to keep
[1:08:44] running
[1:08:48] blessed hurts salvation ain't tied to
[1:08:50] mine
[1:08:52] she's got an individual affair with
[1:08:54] Christ if I've fallen away inside she
[1:08:57] can go on with Christ
[1:08:59] she's in this race herself
[1:09:03] come on now
[1:09:06] each one of us are running
[1:09:08] and we're running brother because when
[1:09:09] you know why time's about over
[1:09:13] with eternity
[1:09:14] it's about time is blending eternity
[1:09:16] we're at the end of everything
[1:09:18] look at Martin Luther
[1:09:20] when God showed him a light he grabbed
[1:09:22] that baton brother he ran with his
[1:09:24] message
[1:09:25] do you realize
[1:09:27] if Martin Luther could have lived long
[1:09:29] enough he didn't believe John Wesley's
[1:09:31] message
[1:09:33] but he couldn't live long enough so when
[1:09:35] he was done running Wesley picked up the
[1:09:37] Baton and he had to run
[1:09:40] that's right and Wesley if he had lived
[1:09:42] long enough when the writer went on into
[1:09:44] the Pentecostal message
[1:09:46] yeah
[1:09:47] but he couldn't live long enough
[1:09:49] so then they hand it off to the
[1:09:51] Pentecostals and the Pentecostals Ran So
[1:09:54] Far
[1:09:55] and if they had kept running they'd come
[1:09:57] right where we're at tonight
[1:09:59] now here's what I'm telling you that
[1:10:01] badon is in your hand
[1:10:02] listen to me folks there ain't nobody
[1:10:04] coming after you
[1:10:06] this is the group that's going to finish
[1:10:07] this race and all of them back there
[1:10:10] can't be made perfect without us
[1:10:12] we've got to finish this race and we've
[1:10:15] got to finish it strong
[1:10:21] listen they'd say oh brother Branham I
[1:10:24] heard people say the other day brother
[1:10:25] Branham he he plays Rise Place her eyes
[1:10:27] I said y'all are you really that
[1:10:29] ignorant
[1:10:30] that you don't understand that brother
[1:10:33] Brandon preached Luther's message
[1:10:34] Wesley's message Pentecostal message he
[1:10:37] gleaned from a lot of those Brethren
[1:10:38] because there was truth often amazes
[1:10:40] didn't come to bring a different message
[1:10:41] he come to take all the loose sins and
[1:10:43] tied up
[1:10:44] it don't bother me he quoted other men
[1:10:47] that means that God had truth even in
[1:10:49] their mother ages
[1:10:50] [Applause]
[1:10:52] that light came that fire came
[1:10:56] that terrifier came
[1:10:59] and did what took all the Lucy and death
[1:11:01] of me and tied it all up together and
[1:11:03] gave us a perfect word of God in his age
[1:11:07] and with this message amen
[1:11:11] amen look how many years you said 50.
[1:11:13] two years look how long brother Dales
[1:11:16] ran
[1:11:18] brother Samuel death look how long he's
[1:11:20] ran with this message now I don't know
[1:11:22] how long he'll be here I hope he's here
[1:11:24] to Jesus Christ but I don't know
[1:11:26] I don't know if I'd be here to Jesus
[1:11:27] comes but if God leaves him and here and
[1:11:30] takes me I want to finish strong
[1:11:34] I want to leave an example behind for
[1:11:36] others if he can do it I can do it
[1:11:42] but you notice what we're seeing now
[1:11:44] listen
[1:11:45] what we're seeing now hate to say it
[1:11:47] we're seeing less runners
[1:11:51] I hate to say it but the further it goes
[1:11:53] y'all don't expect to get bigger
[1:11:57] could get less look you can't look
[1:11:59] there's people I'd love to if y'all
[1:12:00] don't have it here but I'd love to flip
[1:12:02] the pyramid upside down I'd love to
[1:12:04] I'd love to start out small and get wide
[1:12:06] but a donut starts out wide and gets
[1:12:08] small
[1:12:10] gets to get into the minority all the
[1:12:12] time
[1:12:13] now I said the other day at our church I
[1:12:15] said you realize Peter preached one
[1:12:16] sermon Holy Ghost Field man one sermon
[1:12:18] he goes three thousand Souls was added
[1:12:20] to the church
[1:12:21] it takes all of us preachers together to
[1:12:23] preach 3 000 sermons just get one Soul
[1:12:25] at it now
[1:12:28] very few coming now
[1:12:33] coming
[1:12:36] less Runners yeah
[1:12:38] less runners
[1:12:42] but there's still a group ain't gonna
[1:12:43] quit running
[1:12:45] God's got some people right here gonna
[1:12:47] run all the way to perfection
[1:12:52] you've got a little bit of water I could
[1:12:53] have a matter of fact it's sitting on
[1:12:55] your desk I I stole one out of that
[1:12:57] refrigerator
[1:12:59] foreign
[1:13:00] he told me I could have it
[1:13:03] I just need this one I throw this dry
[1:13:10] can I have a couple more minutes
[1:13:15] less less running
[1:13:17] I'll tell you why in just a second
[1:13:20] 7 26 give me about 15 minutes
[1:13:22] I can't preach all this tonight it's
[1:13:24] impossible
[1:13:26] I hope I gave you something think about
[1:13:29] all I know is what they had in that way
[1:13:31] Great Wide age we got it today
[1:13:35] same message Paul preach we got it right
[1:13:37] here tonight
[1:13:38] that ain't guesswork we got the same
[1:13:40] revelation
[1:13:41] if you brought the Apostle Paul back
[1:13:43] here tonight stood him in this Pulpit he
[1:13:45] preached William Bradley's message
[1:13:48] if you took William Bradham and put him
[1:13:50] in public he wrote 13 books of the Bible
[1:13:53] he preached the same message Paul
[1:13:55] preached had no Church of God Boy tell
[1:13:57] me how in the world could you believe
[1:13:58] that me and two thousand years apart
[1:14:00] preached the same gospel I said you're
[1:14:01] looking at the two men I'm looking at
[1:14:03] the source they got it from
[1:14:05] [Applause]
[1:14:10] that's why they got the same Revelation
[1:14:12] they got it from the exact same source
[1:14:17] Cornerstone becomes
[1:14:20] headstone
[1:14:22] I've used this one all over the world
[1:14:25] what is that
[1:14:27] I appreciate your your church I said you
[1:14:29] figured out what it is now didn't you I
[1:14:32] think you said the handkerchief last
[1:14:33] time that's a tile
[1:14:35] be more definitive it's a rag
[1:14:37] put in this pocket right
[1:14:39] what if I switch this rack to this
[1:14:41] pocket
[1:14:42] did I change the rag
[1:14:44] I'll just change the location
[1:14:46] from the left pocket to the right pocket
[1:14:48] if I take the Cornerstone down here and
[1:14:49] make it to headstone is it a different
[1:14:51] Stone no it's just a different location
[1:14:53] but it's the same Stone
[1:14:55] the Cornerstone has now become The
[1:14:57] Headstone the alphas become the Omega
[1:15:00] first match and last match identically
[1:15:02] the same
[1:15:03] he turned our hearts back to the faith
[1:15:06] of the apostolic fathers
[1:15:09] we got that message but with the
[1:15:11] maturity to take this and run it to the
[1:15:13] Rapture to perfection
[1:15:18] now Paul in several places
[1:15:20] spoke of this race
[1:15:22] not just read them to you quickly First
[1:15:25] Corinthians 9 24. no you not they that
[1:15:27] run in a race
[1:15:29] run all but one receiveth the prize so
[1:15:32] run that you may obtain we ain't running
[1:15:36] just to be running
[1:15:38] we got a purpose
[1:15:40] five seven you did right well who did
[1:15:42] handle you should not obey the truth
[1:15:44] I won't get into you know the history of
[1:15:45] them judaizers coming to trying to mix
[1:15:47] it all with Grace they do the same thing
[1:15:50] they try to mix illegalism with Grace
[1:15:53] if it don't work
[1:15:54] that's why people are getting out of the
[1:15:56] race
[1:15:58] Christ
[1:15:59] look rules is not going to hold people
[1:16:02] they've got to be born again
[1:16:06] young people if you don't get an
[1:16:07] experience with Christ this message will
[1:16:09] become a real book to you and after a
[1:16:11] while you'll get tired of the rules
[1:16:16] and that old nature will drive you to
[1:16:17] the world
[1:16:19] you'll play along until you get old
[1:16:21] enough to disobey without getting a
[1:16:22] whooping
[1:16:25] if I told my boys all six of them I said
[1:16:27] you live in my house I know you ain't
[1:16:29] got no conviction so you're going to
[1:16:30] borrow mine until you get your own

[1:19:19] of them that came out of that to this
[1:19:21] message it was all from all them other
[1:19:22] groups but very few from that Pentecost

[1:23:47] opened to John 5 started reading and I
[1:23:49] read where the angel come down and
[1:23:51] stirred the water
[1:23:53] and I went out there and preached
[1:23:56] that whosoever will can come
[1:23:59] but not winsoever
[1:24:02] in other words you can only come when
[1:24:05] God calls
[1:24:07] the Angels got to start if the Angels
[1:24:09] started water it's just water
[1:24:11] but the angel stirs of water It's
[1:24:13] Supernatural then

[1:24:54] Christmas for brother Branham
[1:24:57] that was the will of God
[1:24:59] to write their laws and you couldn't
[1:25:01] find the word of God being worked out

[1:25:16] I felt somebody come behind me and I
[1:25:19] quickly pulled the covers back and
[1:25:21] Jeremiah was sitting on the couch tears
[1:25:23] rolling out his face said what's wrong

[1:26:09] baptized well he said let's baptize him
[1:26:12] filled the pool up I went down there
[1:26:14] about four or 500 people and I baptized
[1:26:16] him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:18] and he has never been the same
[1:26:22] [Applause]
[1:26:23] God he can call it Preacher's Son or he
[1:26:27] can call a drug addict or a prostitute
[1:26:29] or anybody else he can told him by his
[1:26:31] grace and put him in this great race
[1:26:34] you know what I tell my boys when
[1:26:35] daddy's dead and gone you keep running
[1:26:37] with this message if God reveals it to
[1:26:40] you hey I'll say it if God reveals unto
[1:26:42] you they're in the devil in hell that
[1:26:43] can take it out of you
[1:26:45] there ain't enough false prophets you
[1:26:47] can take your eyes off this message if
[1:26:49] God ever reveals it to you but if
[1:26:51] somebody talks you in if somebody can
[1:26:52] talk you out of it
[1:26:55] but if God reveals it to you nobody'll
[1:26:57] ever talk you out of it
[1:26:59] let me tell you why I said all that
[1:27:02] because it's personally revealed to you
[1:27:04] when God reveals it to you brother
[1:27:06] you're in this race and you've got to
[1:27:08] run it it's in your hands you've got to
[1:27:11] run this race now look I've seen it I
[1:27:13] hate to say it but now we're starting I
[1:27:14] said the other day called a preacher
[1:27:15] from South Africa brother what's going
[1:27:17] on I said look brother brother Branham
[1:27:19] he witnessed Janice and jabras dathan
[1:27:22] corn balams witnessed all that right
[1:27:24] there at the time of the shook I submit
[1:27:26] you I hate to say it but we're starting
[1:27:28] to see that Judas Spirit raise up now
[1:27:30] kissing the door to the Rapture and
[1:27:32] going to the tribulation period I said
[1:27:35] yes sir that spirit's starting to be
[1:27:36] sown and we're seeing a great Falling
[1:27:39] Away taking place brother but While
[1:27:41] others are falling away boy I'm gripping
[1:27:43] it tired and I ever could because I know
[1:27:45] before falling before there can be a
[1:27:47] calling way there's got to be a falling
[1:27:49] away and if we're seeing a falling way
[1:27:51] that means that's fixing to be a colony
[1:27:53] away he's fixing to take a bride holding
[1:27:55] the glory
[1:28:00] you've got to get into personally yes
[1:28:02] yes preachers are dropping out just
[1:28:03] close close friends of mine I mean it
[1:28:06] baffles you when you see that happen
[1:28:07] what in the world these men are preach
[1:28:10] this message and the truth is look this
[1:28:13] knowledge up here ain't going to hold
[1:28:14] you
[1:28:16] it's got to get down in here
[1:28:19] right you you can't look you can run
[1:28:21] this a while but if you ain't ordained
[1:28:24] to be on that track
[1:28:25] buy the new birth
[1:28:28] your legs are going to start wobbling
[1:28:30] I mean you can rough around you get on
[1:28:32] that curb start coming on the other side
[1:28:34] brother your legs start wobbling
[1:28:36] if ain't no New Birth there but if
[1:28:38] that's a new birth there you'll keep
[1:28:39] right on moving with the word old Napa
[1:28:41] time following that light keep on
[1:28:43] running this race not just preachers
[1:28:45] laity we're shocked at the people we see
[1:28:47] Fall Away
[1:28:48] and we don't rejoice in it it's sad
[1:28:52] sad brother we don't rejoice in seeing
[1:28:54] people walk away it hurts us to see that
[1:28:57] happen
[1:28:59] but you can't run it without the new
[1:29:01] birth
[1:29:02] that's a little seemed like almost a
[1:29:04] paradox
[1:29:05] run
[1:29:07] with patience the race
[1:29:09] I don't even associate where patience
[1:29:11] would run and
[1:29:13] man when I think of running when I was a
[1:29:14] kid I ran one time from the law
[1:29:17] and Sunday with nothing patient about it
[1:29:20] me and my cousin that boy never could
[1:29:22] outrun me but when we saw them four cop
[1:29:24] cars coming by the way they never did
[1:29:27] find us
[1:29:28] we ran we knew that neighborhood like
[1:29:30] the back of our hand we jumped fences
[1:29:32] and went through porches and everywhere
[1:29:33] else ended up in the same house we
[1:29:34] started that they never did find us and
[1:29:37] we made 40 bucks off of that
[1:29:41] there wasn't no patience about that
[1:29:43] someone you run you run but this is that
[1:29:46] word patience there is the word
[1:29:47] endurance
[1:29:50] and here's another thing that word race
[1:29:52] look it up it's where we get the word
[1:29:54] agony
[1:29:56] conflict
[1:29:58] and you're going to have a lot of it
[1:30:00] you're gonna face it and when you face
[1:30:03] it it ain't that you've conquered
[1:30:05] everything it's just that now you can
[1:30:07] face everything
[1:30:09] that's something that holds you when you
[1:30:12] can't hold yourself that birth will hold
[1:30:15] you to Christ
[1:30:16] it will give you a tire post
[1:30:20] you see people fall around you you don't
[1:30:22] put your eyes on them put your eyes on
[1:30:23] Christ
[1:30:25] keep it there
[1:30:26] you keep running I wish I had more time
[1:30:30] man right in this shipwreck beat jailed
[1:30:32] fought with beasts at Ephesus stood for
[1:30:35] the word look at the what the man went
[1:30:36] through
[1:30:37] but he said I finished my course
[1:30:39] I fought a good fight
[1:30:42] hey I've run the race
[1:30:44] ain't nothing better than coming to the
[1:30:46] end of knowing ain't no trouble down at
[1:30:48] the river
[1:30:49] I finish this thing strong
[1:30:52] right
[1:30:53] yeah let me tell this story then I'll
[1:30:55] move to one more and I'll close
[1:30:56] when I was younger I still walk
[1:30:59] walk
[1:31:01] three to five miles a day walk
[1:31:04] a little fast but I walk
[1:31:06] let me down and I run
[1:31:09] maybe a block
[1:31:10] that can't run like I used to run
[1:31:12] the other day I got some pain in my knee
[1:31:14] and I said that's
[1:31:16] I said that's not supposed to be there
[1:31:19] but I run every now and then my daddy
[1:31:21] when I was young
[1:31:22] I ran the mile
[1:31:26] and I played baseball in a ran the miles
[1:31:29] and my time in Florida
[1:31:32] I know it's hard to believe it was under
[1:31:33] six minutes
[1:31:37] and it won the whole state of Florida
[1:31:39] and they wanted me to go
[1:31:41] to West Virginia run on the national
[1:31:44] but I had an All-Star Game and I've
[1:31:45] never taken running over baseball
[1:31:48] but in that race
[1:31:49] coach called me my own coach
[1:31:52] said son this is what he said

[1:34:33] got about four things I only got 29
[1:34:35] pages of notes
[1:34:36] so I'll skip the 28.
[1:34:40] let me tell you how you're going to win
[1:34:42] it
[1:34:43] when Paul wrote Hebrews 11.
[1:34:45] before he wrote Hebrews 12 he went the
[1:34:47] whole line of people that ran by faith
[1:34:50] even during the law
[1:34:52] before law ever came he picked up
[1:34:54] Abraham Abraham's for the law Paul
[1:34:57] picked it up he said I was alive without
[1:34:58] the law once that was Abraham law comes
[1:35:00] sin revived that's Moses I died and then
[1:35:02] he brought you to Christ
[1:35:04] and no matter which men you took back
[1:35:06] there they all ended with Christ no
[1:35:08] matter what type you took it ended with
[1:35:10] Christ
[1:35:11] they were all parts of the body he was
[1:35:13] the head everyone that men was pointing
[1:35:15] to this man
[1:35:16] so after Paul preaches Hebrews 11. and
[1:35:19] he comes to Hebrews 12.
[1:35:21] he said looking
[1:35:24] not unto Abraham not to Moses not
[1:35:26] debating not to David not to
[1:35:28] looking under the greatest looking at
[1:35:31] the one they were all looking to
[1:35:33] looking unto Jesus
[1:35:35] the author the one that began it and the
[1:35:37] finisher of your faith
[1:35:41] so I don't matter who I look no no yes

[1:43:20] I bless your name
[1:43:23] [Music]
[1:43:30] pretty good message let's give the Lord
[1:43:32] a handclap
[1:43:36] good job brother that was good
[1:43:39] hey man you know I was thinking that and
[1:43:41] we all kind of have a little bit of an
[1:43:44] athletic background but when you're
[1:43:45] running when you're running a a race
[1:43:48] especially a four-man relay
[1:43:51] you put the best man at the end
[1:43:55] you got your Pacers you got your
[1:43:57] starters but that last guy as soon as he
[1:43:59] grabs that baton
[1:44:01] he's got to make up time
[1:44:03] or he's got to keep the pace going and I
[1:44:06] believe that's what we are
[1:44:08] the prophet went off the scene he handed
[1:44:10] that baton to us
[1:44:14] he handed it to us and you know what he
[1:44:17] done he gave us all the training yeah
[1:44:19] he gave us the best shoes
[1:44:21] he gave us the best message he gave us
[1:44:23] the best preachers he gave us the best
[1:44:26] laity he gave us the best song leaders
[1:44:28] and song musicians
[1:44:30] I don't hear any clapping
[1:44:33] this is the best
[1:44:37] and Paul is even the man that said
[1:44:41] let's run this race amen he's waiting on
[1:44:44] me and you
[1:44:45] he's waiting on me and you he's in that
[1:44:47] other dimension over there he's sitting
[1:44:49] he's waiting when that call comes it's
[1:44:52] got to come from a bride
[1:44:54] yeah
[1:44:56] right hey man the last baton is a body
[1:45:00] change
[1:45:02] it's been handed to me and you
[1:45:04] what are we going to do with it dude
[1:45:06] that's bro Luke said run
[1:45:08] and but run with patience you know you
[1:45:10] can run so fast you can trip and fall
[1:45:13] done that before yeah he runs so fast
[1:45:16] you can trip and fall that's not that's
[1:45:18] why I said run with patience
[1:45:19] you pick your pace
[1:45:22] your pace may be faster than others you
[1:45:24] may Pace may be slower than others but I
[1:45:26] like where brother Luke said because
[1:45:27] we've been preaching on Statue of
[1:45:28] perfect man for a a long period of time
[1:45:30] but that's the Running part we're at the
[1:45:32] Running part we're we're here where we
[1:45:34] can get it right I appreciate my dad and
[1:45:36] the different ones and some of the older
[1:45:38] brother brother Mike hantus not calling
[1:45:39] you old brother Mike but
[1:45:42] some of the old ones
[1:45:44] older ones
[1:45:45] brother there was a lot of there was a
[1:45:48] lot of brush
[1:45:50] in the message Woods
[1:45:53] you couldn't see a lot all they saw was
[1:45:55] a messenger and then there was all kind
[1:45:57] of doctrines went through that all kinds
[1:45:59] of things and you couldn't see but
[1:46:01] praise God brother Mike my dad different
[1:46:03] ones the older ones they took the sword
[1:46:05] of the word and they cut that thing back
[1:46:07] and they cut us a trail so that we can
[1:46:10] finish this race that's just what I
[1:46:12] believe because I went through as a kid
[1:46:13] I went through all that you heard this
[1:46:15] one preach this one you had to follow
[1:46:16] this one you had to follow that one
[1:46:18] listen if you don't fall across you're
[1:46:20] following the wrong person period period
[1:46:23] if you're not following Christ wrong
[1:46:25] person period I don't care you can put
[1:46:27] whatever name you want to in that that's
[1:46:29] right but as we follow it but said Paul
[1:46:31] says follow me
[1:46:33] as I fall across all right so as brother
[1:46:36] Branham followed Christ we're going to
[1:46:37] follow right in line
[1:46:39] amen and you know what he's even waiting
[1:46:42] on us
[1:46:44] he's waiting on us and I I I I sometimes
[1:46:47] I Bro Look I think God maybe lets him
[1:46:49] look over in this Dimension every once
[1:46:51] in a while not see the bad
[1:46:53] I don't want him to see that part
[1:46:55] the people leaving and all I want him to
[1:46:57] see a congregation that's worshiping God
[1:47:00] under the message of the hour under the
[1:47:04] final voice to the final age under her
[1:47:07] messenger
[1:47:07] that's us
[1:47:09] we do have something to say
[1:47:13] we have something to say and I believe
[1:47:15] we're saying that I believe we're taking
[1:47:17] this thing and we've got to write baton
[1:47:19] we've got the right race and like bro
[1:47:20] Luke said you know you can get people
[1:47:21] that run a race and they'll get
[1:47:23] distracted
[1:47:24] yeah and but if I promise you if you put
[1:47:27] your eye on on a certain spot as that
