[24:23] and the 10th verse
[24:26] for the love of money is the root of all
[24:28] evil which while some coveted after
[24:30] they have aired from the faith and
[24:33] pierced themselves through with many

[25:06] commandment without spot
[25:07] unrebukable until the appearing of our
[25:10] lord jesus christ
[25:12] which in his times he shall show who is
[25:15] the blessed
[25:15] and only potentate the king of kings and
[25:18] the lord of lords
[25:19] who only hath immortality dwelling in
[25:21] the light which no man can approach unto
[25:25] whom no man has seen nor can see to whom
[25:27] be honor
[25:28] and power everlasting amen let's just
[25:31] bow our heads father we love you lord
[25:34] jesus your words are life to us and god
[25:37] we're just asking that one more time
[25:38] father you just come our way father one
[25:40] more time you just
[25:42] do what you do father and break the
[25:43] bread of life unto us lord there's
[25:45] no words that could be said to encourage
[25:47] or strengthen us but lord
[25:49] it would come from you father and lord
[25:51] just ask you to circumcise every word
[25:53] father open our hearts to receive lord
[25:55] and
[25:56] lord may you have liberty in this place
[25:58] lord may you have liberty and his soul
[26:00] in each mind father lord
[26:01] we have nothing to bring nothing to give
[26:03] father we openly confess that we have
[26:05] great need of you lord
[26:07] we're nothing father just a sinner saved
[26:09] by grace but lord
[26:10] you are the author of the faith lord and
[26:13] lord you have started to work in us lord
[26:15] and you said you would bring that to a
[26:16] finished father and lord we're trusting
[26:18] in you
[26:19] this afternoon father that you could
[26:20] just give us a little bit more of you
[26:23] father we pray in the name of jesus
[26:24] christ
[26:25] amen you may be seated
[26:29] amen so we we don't have to be rocket
[26:31] scientists or real smart people to
[26:33] realize that we're living in the end
[26:34] times
[26:35] we're living at the last of days and
[26:37] we're living at the fulfillment of all
[26:38] these things and
[26:40] and i believe we're all aware of that
[26:41] especially as christians sitting in here
[26:43] tonight we're aware that this is the
[26:44] culmination of everything that we've
[26:46] lived for and
[26:47] everything that we've been taught and
[26:49] everything that generations past have
[26:50] been taught and passed on to their
[26:52] children and their children and their
[26:53] children's children
[26:54] this is the culmination of that i
[26:56] believe we can see that and
[26:58] you can talk to just any old person on
[26:59] the street and they'll tell you
[27:00] something's different
[27:01] this is the end times and and before you
[27:04] know they'll ask you what what do you
[27:05] think about the end times and do you
[27:07] think this could be the end and
[27:08] and there's a groaning amongst the
[27:10] people about what our brother was
[27:11] speaking about today the whole earth is
[27:13] moving into position
[27:15] and and and this all seems to be hinging
[27:17] around one small circle of people
[27:20] and yet those people do not realize the
[27:22] power that they hold
[27:23] a lot of times you know those people in
[27:25] the middle of that circle they don't
[27:27] realize really that everything is
[27:29] focused around christ
[27:30] in them it's christ in you the hope of
[27:33] glory it's not my personality it's
[27:34] hinging on or
[27:35] brother wade's personality but it's
[27:37] christ in us the whole thing seems to be
[27:40] focused around that and yet in our faith
[27:42] we seem like we're so insignificant and
[27:44] and
[27:45] if satan has his way with us he'll have
[27:47] us thinking that we're not worth nothing
[27:48] and we
[27:49] we don't belong and we're just wandering
[27:51] through and we just happen to pass
[27:52] through this way and
[27:53] maybe we're just here because my daddy
[27:55] will get mad if i go somewhere else but
[27:57] but god has a different plan in mind
[28:00] god didn't just place seed randomly
[28:02] around but he sewed it into those that
[28:04] he knew would come forth at the end
[28:06] and fulfill that word right amen we know
[28:09] this
[28:10] but we're living in a great time not a
[28:12] time of worry
[28:14] not a time of fear not a time of
[28:16] nervousness not a time of rejection
[28:19] not a time to run not a time to get
[28:21] scared not a time to be afraid but we're
[28:23] living in a time of restoration
[28:25] where he promised that there would be a
[28:27] time and it would be at the last day
[28:29] that he would bring restoration to the
[28:31] church and all those things that we've
[28:33] preached about and all those things that
[28:34] we've taught about would come to
[28:36] to a manifestation in our life where we
[28:38] could see god on the move
[28:40] and we could see god in action it
[28:41] wouldn't just be words in a paper or
[28:43] or a tape that we listen to but it would
[28:45] be god coming forth into a life
[28:47] it would be god becoming manifested and
[28:50] even in ourselves we look at ourselves
[28:51] in the mirror and
[28:52] we we line up our own selves and we'll
[28:54] never measure up that way
[28:56] but god elected you
[28:59] i didn't choose you you didn't choose
[29:01] you but god elected you that you would
[29:04] be the manifestation
[29:05] of the fullness of his word that's big
[29:07] shoes to fill but god made you to fill
[29:09] them
[29:10] god created you for that purpose he he
[29:13] thought of you before there was a
[29:14] creation
[29:15] before there was a time before there was
[29:17] any fault or before there was any sin or
[29:19] before there was any sorrow
[29:20] he thought of you bringing to
[29:22] manifestation the promise of all things
[29:25] in this hour i believe we are the seed
[29:26] of abraham we're the spiritual seed of
[29:28] abraham
[29:29] and we will possess all things it's not
[29:32] it's not a question it's not up for
[29:33] debate
[29:34] it's not a maybe soul but we will
[29:36] possess
[29:37] all things and and and i believe the
[29:40] believer
[29:41] recognizes that deep in their soul but
[29:43] they're clouded over sometimes sometimes
[29:44] we get a little shell around us
[29:46] and we get a little nervous spirit on us
[29:48] or we get a little anxious spirit on us
[29:50] and we're afraid to step out by faith
[29:52] but that's exactly why satan has
[29:54] attacked us with that fear because he
[29:55] doesn't want us
[29:57] to recognize who we are and what place
[30:00] we have
[30:01] what position we hold what authority
[30:03] given
[30:04] but there's a day coming when the
[30:06] authority will be recognized
[30:08] i believe we're in that day if we could
[30:09] just use this scripture for reference
[30:11] it's in joel chapter 2 we know it
[30:13] the bible says fear not o land be glad
[30:16] and rejoice for the lord will do great
[30:18] things
[30:18] be not afraid ye beast of the field for
[30:21] the pastures of the wilderness do spring
[30:23] for the tree beareth her fruit the fig
[30:25] tree and the vine to yield their
[30:27] strength
[30:27] be glad then you children of zion and
[30:29] rejoice in the lord your god
[30:31] for he hath given you the former reign
[30:34] moderately and he will cost to come down
[30:36] for the rain the former rain and the
[30:39] latter rain in the first month
[30:41] and the floor shall be full of wheat and
[30:43] the vat shall overflow with wine and oil
[30:46] and i will restore this is the lord
[30:48] speaking and i
[30:50] will restore to you the years
[30:54] that the locust hath eaten the
[30:55] cankerworm and the caterpillar in the
[30:57] palmer worm
[30:58] my great army which i sent among you and
[31:00] ye
[31:01] shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[31:04] and praise the name of your of the lord
[31:06] your god
[31:07] that hath dwelt wondrously with you and
[31:10] my people shall never
[31:11] be ashamed now i might i might read that
[31:14] scripture and i might think differently
[31:16] if it was just some man promising
[31:18] those things or if it was just you know
[31:20] a great king somewhere promising those
[31:22] things
[31:22] but the lord god almighty has sent us a
[31:24] promise in this day
[31:27] now a lot of years have been stolen from
[31:29] the church of god
[31:30] a lot of years have been taken and a lot
[31:32] of scars have been added and a lot of
[31:34] distress and a lot of peril and a lot of
[31:36] defeat and a lot of sickness and a lot
[31:38] of poor health and
[31:40] but there's a new day coming he said i
[31:42] will restore
[31:44] all the years all those years that you
[31:46] fought that sickness
[31:47] i am bringing a restoration unto you
[31:50] it's not a promise from me
[31:51] it wasn't a promise from william branham
[31:53] or from the prophet joel
[31:54] but it was from the lord god almighty i
[31:57] will do it myself i will come and i will
[32:00] restore those things which have been
[32:01] taken from you
[32:03] i believe we're living in the greatest
[32:04] time that there ever has been there's
[32:07] never been an eye see what we're seeing
[32:08] in this day
[32:09] there's never been a soul uh
[32:11] commissioned to complete what we're
[32:13] commissioned to complete in this hour
[32:15] now enoch is our is what we look to but
[32:18] but he was just one man
[32:20] walking with god so much a man that
[32:22] brother man would say you can get so on
[32:24] fire for god
[32:25] that satan doesn't know what to do with
[32:26] you enoch walked with god
[32:28] so much that there was no room for the
[32:31] dragon to work in him there was no room
[32:33] for the serpent to work in his life
[32:34] because he was walking and striving
[32:37] with the living word now i ask you what
[32:40] difference
[32:40] is our life today enoch wasn't given
[32:43] some some great
[32:44] some great thing that was unreachable
[32:45] for us today but he was walking
[32:48] with the living word walking talking
[32:51] fellowshipping with the living word
[32:54] we're given the same promise in this
[32:56] hour
[32:57] restoration is promised to come to all
[33:00] things
[33:01] but you have to recognize your day and
[33:03] its message and i know i'm preaching to
[33:05] well taught so if we just
[33:06] you can just fill in the blanks and you
[33:08] i know that you know where i'm going but
[33:11] you are a chosen people maybe i'll just
[33:13] slow down for a second
[33:15] you are a chosen people elected called
[33:18] and we read that and we think well
[33:19] that's wonderful
[33:21] but that comes with an authority that's
[33:22] right that comes with a power
[33:25] we don't have to take what the devil
[33:26] gives us we don't have to take a back
[33:28] seat we don't have to back up and say
[33:30] well we'll just have to endure with this
[33:32] but the battle is overcoming the battle
[33:35] is looking beyond what's in front of us
[33:37] and looking to what we don't see
[33:39] the promise given out there by faith
[33:42] abraham saw these things and by faith
[33:45] abraham walked and by faith abraham
[33:47] received a body change
[33:48] because he was looking to the unseen he
[33:51] wasn't looking at this flesh he wasn't
[33:53] looking at this
[33:53] this corruption but he was looking that
[33:56] one day
[33:57] this must put on incorruption
[34:01] if we can get to that same faith but we
[34:02] have to recognize
[34:04] what day we're in you see god has a time
[34:06] and he has a place
[34:08] and he has a day and we cannot look back
[34:10] and blame those that have gone before us
[34:12] it wasn't the time yet
[34:13] it wasn't time to crack the wheat yet
[34:15] but now is the time
[34:16] he said now in this day it will be
[34:19] revealed unto you he said
[34:21] in this last day friends if this isn't
[34:24] the last day then
[34:25] what's going on out here there's wars
[34:27] and rumors of wars
[34:28] and men's hearts are failing for fear
[34:30] and there's false prophets arising and
[34:32] and everything that was prophesied to
[34:33] come is on the earth and even our
[34:35] prophet would say that
[34:37] up here we're not waiting on anything
[34:40] else to come
[34:42] but it's already being fulfilled now i
[34:44] believe by prophetic vision he saw this
[34:46] church assembly here he saw
[34:48] us sitting here and he saw our lives he
[34:50] said we're not waiting on anything else
[34:52] but it's already being manifested in the
[34:54] bride
[34:55] it's already coming into body form where
[34:57] we can we can touch it and we can feel
[34:59] it and we can see it and
[35:00] we can fellowship with it that's the age
[35:02] that we're living in
[35:04] in age like no other age before some of
[35:06] those people were thought of in the mind
[35:08] of god to be martyrs
[35:10] they were thought of in the mind of god
[35:11] to come so close but not far enough
[35:14] because there would be a chosen time for
[35:16] a chosen people
[35:18] that would bring restoration of all
[35:20] things into the church
[35:22] we can't just pick and choose what we
[35:23] want to bring back into the church we
[35:25] can't just take our pet doctrine and
[35:26] bring it in and
[35:27] we just restore that unto me but god
[35:29] said all things
[35:31] will be restored but we have to
[35:32] recognize the day that we're living in
[35:34] he says lord
[35:35] here we are again on the third this is
[35:38] the lifetime
[35:39] three is the number of life and here we
[35:41] are ready for the rapture
[35:43] the church is moving on the great
[35:44] scientists world the churches today
[35:46] setting full of skeptic believers
[35:48] tens of thousands with their names on
[35:50] the book yes millions
[35:51] and would laugh at the gospel and say
[35:53] that they're uneducated
[35:55] they don't know maybe that's so lord but
[35:58] what we lack in education you make up in
[36:00] grace
[36:01] by sending your angel of light by
[36:04] manifesting his power
[36:06] confirming the words to those who are
[36:08] poor and illiterate as we
[36:09] but we love you for this because it's
[36:11] the grace of god that has did it
[36:13] and we know that we were born
[36:17] you got to have that phrase down and we
[36:19] know that we were born
[36:21] and we're not lovely at all we're very
[36:23] unlovely but thou
[36:25] through grace reached down thy merciful
[36:27] hand and has opened our eyes
[36:29] as jesus prayed for us as elijah did for
[36:32] gehazi
[36:33] as he looked to see around him and today
[36:35] our eyes are open
[36:37] and we see the things of god and know
[36:39] we're moving at the end time
[36:41] when the gentile people's days are about
[36:43] finished he'll take a people for his
[36:45] name
[36:46] let us be included there lord humbly we
[36:49] beg
[36:49] we pray that you'll grant it amen he's
[36:52] taken to people
[36:54] it's not by our education it's not by
[36:56] our theology
[36:57] it's not by our great revelation but
[36:59] it's by his grace
[37:01] it's by his grace that we're saved it's
[37:03] i thank god for that because if it was
[37:05] it was up to me and my smarts and my my
[37:08] ability to figure it out i'd be lost uh
[37:10] i'd be like we were the other day trying
[37:11] to figure out whether joe's little
[37:13] puzzles you know just
[37:14] just a question in the mind well it's
[37:15] got to unlock somehow but i'm just not
[37:17] the guy to figure it out i just don't
[37:18] know how to do it
[37:19] but thank god it's by grace and he
[37:22] called you by name amen
[37:25] now maybe you haven't heard your name
[37:26] called audibly but you're sitting in
[37:28] here
[37:29] you've been presented with a light
[37:35] he said we overcame because you sent
[37:37] your angel of light
[37:39] and you manifested your power through
[37:41] him now you can't unhear what you've
[37:43] already heard
[37:44] you've already been presented with the
[37:45] truth you've already presented been
[37:47] presented with
[37:47] with these things that we believe in and
[37:49] we know that god sent a prophet and we
[37:51] know that he came and did the signs and
[37:52] wonders
[37:53] but we know what he preached that there
[37:55] would be a people
[37:57] and you and no matter how far you run
[37:59] away from that no matter how far you
[38:00] deny that he was a prophet
[38:02] or the word was vindicated or that he
[38:04] was authorized to do what he did
[38:05] you cannot unhear the fact that he that
[38:08] he said there would be
[38:09] a people that will take this word and
[38:12] they will bring it to manifestation
[38:14] it's not manifesting time it's
[38:16] manifested time i believe we're in the
[38:18] age where we are
[38:20] we are moving up into that realm that
[38:22] realm is moving down and we're remember
[38:24] that song
[38:25] we'll speed up and they'll slow down and
[38:27] we'll just get hand in hand with them
[38:29] that dimension is so close if it was
[38:31] only 15 feet away back in 1963
[38:34] how close is it now that dimension is
[38:36] slowing down to our speed and we're
[38:38] speeding up to it
[38:39] and just very soon there will be i saw
[38:42] those pictures down there in the
[38:43] basement just very soon any day it might
[38:45] be a fairy tale to somebody
[38:46] but i'm a believer that very soon there
[38:49] will be an 18 year old woman walk
[38:51] through that door there
[38:52] there will be somebody that we've seen
[38:54] going on before and and you might think
[38:56] you'd get a little excited now and we
[38:57] might think we're going to get a little
[38:58] over excited and you say why is this guy
[39:00] up there yelling why is he screaming and
[39:01] why is he spitting
[39:02] because i've seen into that dimension i
[39:04] know it's real
[39:05] i brought back grapes from that and i
[39:07] can say taste and see that the lord is
[39:09] good
[39:10] i'm not preaching this from from
[39:11] somewhere i've never been but i've been
[39:13] over there
[39:14] and i've seen what god can do in his
[39:16] power and his mind how he can save
[39:17] a sinner how he can save a good old
[39:20] hypocrite
[39:21] how he can save just a message pharisee
[39:24] raising the message and sitting on the
[39:26] front pew and saying amen when you're
[39:27] supposed to say but god can even save
[39:29] that
[39:30] he knows how to get your attention he
[39:33] knows how to break you
[39:34] he knows how to how to mold you to get
[39:36] your attention
[39:38] but we must recognize our day and his
[39:41] message
[39:42] jesus said it will be the same thing at
[39:44] the coming oh then the evening light of
[39:46] malachi 4 comes shining through the
[39:48] darkness amen to bring
[39:50] the evening light on the predestinated
[39:52] word on who
[39:53] the predestinated word hallelujah that's
[39:56] the fourth message to be
[39:58] that's the fourth messenger to shine the
[40:00] light on the word
[40:02] the word is predestinated it has to come
[40:05] forth
[40:07] when god gives a prophecy there's not a
[40:10] devil
[40:11] there's not a team of devils there's not
[40:13] a there's not a hundred devils
[40:16] there's nothing that could stop that
[40:17] from coming to pass
[40:19] because god gave a prophecy so when i
[40:21] read this i don't think well maybe
[40:23] there's a people far out somewhere
[40:24] that's going to do it
[40:25] i read this and i say god said that no
[40:27] matter how many devils come against me
[40:29] no matter how many sicknesses attack my
[40:31] body no matter how many depressions
[40:33] attack my mind
[40:34] i will come out i am that lily no matter
[40:37] what you plant on top of me i'm gonna
[40:39] bring forth life because there's a seed
[40:41] in there
[40:41] that no man put in there that no doctor
[40:44] put in there
[40:44] but god himself planted in there before
[40:47] the foundation of the world and he said
[40:48] you will be an overcomer
[40:50] that's me that's you well who else
[40:55] who else is going to fulfill these
[40:56] scriptures but it falls on the
[40:58] predestinated word
[41:01] he says i will restore saith the lord
[41:04] i will restore right the evening lights
[41:08] come shining through now it's not light
[41:12] it's lights evening lights
[41:15] now there once was there once was a man
[41:18] that came and he was the evening light
[41:20] and he brought a truth and he brought a
[41:21] vindicated word but it didn't stop there
[41:23] he said now there will be evening
[41:25] lights those that actually picked up
[41:27] what i was saying those that actually
[41:29] believe what i'm saying and that they
[41:31] can manifest it in their life
[41:33] it's not just a fairy tale for some
[41:34] other time but there's evening light
[41:36] sitting here i believe
[41:40] matthew 24
[41:43] matthew 24 comes in two phases right
[41:47] there's questions asked in the morning
[41:49] and there's answers given at night
[41:52] in the evening time the questions are
[41:54] asked in the morning of the day
[41:56] matthew 24 took place on a tuesday it's
[41:59] the third day of the week
[42:00] you have to recognize your day and i'm
[42:02] not an over typologist but these things
[42:04] are important
[42:06] it was on a tuesday the disciples
[42:08] started asking and the prophecy came
[42:10] forth
[42:10] that the seals would be open that these
[42:12] seals would be delivered
[42:14] and they wouldn't just be locked up and
[42:15] they wouldn't be hidden in parables and
[42:17] they wouldn't be
[42:17] but there will come a day and he said
[42:19] and at that day if you ask in my name
[42:22] and that was at the evening of the third
[42:24] day so i ask you what day
[42:25] are we living in you got to know what
[42:29] day you're living
[42:30] in so many things can transpire in just
[42:33] a few moments
[42:34] so many things can change in just a just
[42:36] a
[42:37] twinkling of an eye what day are we
[42:40] living in
[42:42] there was questions asked in the morning
[42:44] and there was answers given in the
[42:45] evening
[42:46] there was a prophecy going forth and
[42:48] there was a fulfillment given
[42:50] just just in one day's time in the
[42:52] evening
[42:53] light i think about another third day
[42:59] when it was the third day that was
[43:00] promised that there would be one
[43:02] resurrect
[43:03] now that day is also broken up into two
[43:05] stages i know we're studiers of the
[43:07] message and we know these things
[43:08] but there's two stages to that day as
[43:10] well and and and on the first day
[43:13] nothing just death
[43:16] second day death of course the prophet
[43:18] goes into this martin
[43:19] uh luther and wesley no life
[43:23] no life at the beginning of the third
[43:25] day there was a rumor
[43:28] there was a rumor went forth that he was
[43:30] alive there was a rumor went forth that
[43:32] he had resurrected
[43:33] and that the the the stone had rolled
[43:35] away from the tomb and
[43:36] there was a rumor that he was open but
[43:38] there was two parts to that third day
[43:40] and i think of it like this just real
[43:41] simple i'm just a real simple guy that
[43:43] cleophas and his friend
[43:45] were walking on the road to emmaus
[43:50] i love that it never mentions who he is
[43:53] actually brother branham tells us it was
[43:54] cleophas and his friend
[43:56] the bible says cleophas in another
[43:58] cleophus and his friend were walking
[44:00] and they were talking and they were they
[44:02] were visiting on these things and there
[44:03] was a rumor going around that there
[44:05] would be
[44:05] a resurrection and they they knew him in
[44:07] in flesh
[44:08] they walk with him they talk with him
[44:10] they ate with him they fellowship with
[44:12] him
[44:12] but yet there was still doubt in their
[44:14] heart well what what what are these
[44:16] things and
[44:17] what disparity are we into
[44:20] on it i just can i just be personal with
[44:23] you
[44:25] that's how the devil works we'll ask for
[44:28] many things in our life we'll have
[44:29] prayed for many things and
[44:31] we'll be seeking miracles and we'll be
[44:32] seeking signs and they don't come to
[44:34] pass the way that we want them
[44:36] and they don't come to pass in the time
[44:37] that we want them and then the devil
[44:39] creeps in
[44:42] with with that unbelief and he'll creep
[44:45] in with depression
[44:46] and he'll creep in with that anxious
[44:47] spirit and you'll get so nervous in
[44:50] yourself you don't know whether to trust
[44:51] god at his word or not because
[44:53] because it hasn't happened in the time
[44:54] that you thought it would happen it
[44:55] didn't happen just the way that you
[44:57] thought it would happen
[44:58] and the devil's right there
[45:04] to argue about it quick quick to bring
[45:06] out the faults and say well what about
[45:08] this and what about that and
[45:09] look at this over here and and look at
[45:12] the look at the back parts of israel
[45:14] as the scripture says and look at the
[45:15] faults happening in the church and
[45:17] look at the la the separation there and
[45:19] the spirit of division and
[45:21] this one's off here and this one's off
[45:22] there before you know it you feel so
[45:24] isolated you don't want to leave your
[45:25] own home and
[45:26] you just want to stay by yourself
[45:27] because you feel anywhere you go is
[45:28] treacherous ground
[45:29] but god said he would restore all things
[45:33] all the years that your mind has lost
[45:35] and it's not lost out there somewhere
[45:37] but all the years
[45:39] that you've given over to the devil just
[45:41] just just
[45:43] anxious in yourself unsure of your faith
[45:47] unsure to step out on god's word and say
[45:49] that promise is mine
[45:50] all the years that have slipped by worry
[45:53] not they're going to be restored
[45:56] if not us then who we must recognize
[46:00] the day that we're living in and so
[46:03] these two were walking on the road
[46:06] they began to talk about these things
[46:08] and they begin to
[46:09] to say is he resurrected really is this
[46:12] ward really alive is it come back and
[46:15] you know there was a they took a hundred
[46:17] men to roll that stone in front of the
[46:18] tomb
[46:19] now it took a hundred men to roll that
[46:21] that stone in front of the tomb and
[46:23] there's no way he could have got out in
[46:24] there just think about these are just
[46:25] men like us
[46:26] that have rational thoughts like we do
[46:28] we think how impossible would it have
[46:30] been for peter and john to roll away a
[46:32] stone
[46:32] that took a hundred men to do it but
[46:34] when the evening light comes it doesn't
[46:36] matter how big the stone is
[46:38] you might have a hundred denominational
[46:40] powers behind you
[46:41] to tell you that this goes this way and
[46:43] you can't access that and you can't get
[46:45] there and
[46:45] rapturing faith is out of grass but it
[46:47] just takes one
[46:49] light one evening light to come through
[46:51] and roll away the stone it doesn't
[46:52] matter what's in front of you
[46:54] it might have taken a hundred men to put
[46:56] that stone in front of you
[46:58] you might have been in and out of church
[46:59] and you might have had this preached you
[47:01] and that preached to you in falseness
[47:02] and false doctrine and you feel that
[47:04] your foundation is weak and it's
[47:06] crumbling it doesn't matter if it took a
[47:08] if you went through a hundred churches
[47:10] it just takes
[47:11] one light one light to roll away the
[47:14] stone
[47:16] the third day is the first day that life
[47:18] would come on the earth
[47:22] genesis 11. the third day
[47:25] is the day that abraham offers isaac
[47:29] as a sacrifice and the sacrifice is
[47:32] accepted
[47:32] and iran comes forth you see you got to
[47:34] recognize the day
[47:35] that you're living in
[47:39] the third day is the day that god comes
[47:41] down in a pillar of fire and begins to
[47:43] speak directly to israel
[47:44] by by thunders and lightning and that's
[47:47] the day that he brings forth the ten
[47:48] commandments
[47:49] on the third day on the third day in
[47:52] leviticus and numbers and
[47:54] and and those old testament scriptures
[47:56] the third day was when the sacrifice was
[47:58] to be accepted
[47:59] touch not to sacrifice until the third
[48:01] day when it's accepted
[48:03] friends what day are we living in
[48:05] there's a day when there's going to be a
[48:06] people come to authority
[48:08] that recognize the day that we're living
[48:10] in the message we've been given the
[48:11] light that we're walking in
[48:13] it's not just something to debate about
[48:15] it's not just something to have quote
[48:16] wars back and forth about and i'm right
[48:18] and you're wrong
[48:19] but this is a vindicated word to a
[48:21] vindicated people
[48:22] and i don't know who's going to be in
[48:24] front of me but i'm going to receive
[48:25] everything you got to get out of my way
[48:27] that's for me i don't care what you look
[48:29] like in front of me i don't care how big
[48:31] the mountain is i don't care if the
[48:32] stone took 100 men to roll in front of
[48:34] it
[48:34] that vindicated word is for me that's a
[48:37] promise for me that's a
[48:38] that's a victory in my camp
[48:42] we've got to recognize it was in the
[48:44] book of esther the fifth chapter
[48:46] on the third day that she would put away
[48:50] her robes her sackcloth and she would
[48:54] put away her robes of mourning
[48:56] her rubs of nervousness lay it aside and
[48:58] she would enter into the king's room
[49:00] and he would grant her authority esther
[49:03] was given authority on the third day
[49:05] where are we church esther
[49:08] esther had to go beyond what she felt
[49:10] like had to go beyond her her physical
[49:13] faith and
[49:14] go beyond what she could do in her own
[49:15] power she said he's either going to take
[49:17] me
[49:17] or he's going to kill me but she knew
[49:19] that there was something there
[49:21] when he first looked at her in that room
[49:22] and there was a there was something in
[49:24] his eye that told her
[49:25] he loves me i'm going to go in and
[49:27] receive my authority
[49:29] and you know what esther received up to
[49:31] half of the kingdom
[49:34] she recognized her day friends we've got
[49:37] to recognize
[49:38] where we're living what day is this
[49:41] this is not just a another day just
[49:43] another sunday just the
[49:44] the 20th here another father's day but
[49:47] this is the final day
[49:51] young people don't be despaired by this
[49:54] and think well i'm not going to get to
[49:55] live my life and i'm not to
[49:56] get live it to the fullness but god
[49:59] thought of you for that purpose
[50:01] because you can handle it because you
[50:02] were made for it you were you were given
[50:04] a flesh body to fulfill that purpose
[50:06] because you
[50:07] were made for this generation you were
[50:10] made to be an overcomer in this age
[50:13] when it's the darkest stage you have to
[50:15] go through many things that i did not
[50:16] have to go through
[50:17] i remember when texting and phones first
[50:19] came out i was just i was a teenager
[50:21] already
[50:22] but but but it's been here since then
[50:24] this generation that that's coming up is
[50:26] going through things that we could never
[50:27] imagine that that they would have to go
[50:28] through
[50:29] but you were made for it
[50:32] that's right you weren't just made to go
[50:34] through it you were made to overcome it
[50:37] you were made to be victorious on the
[50:38] other side god's not going to lose one
[50:40] he hasn't forgotten you he doesn't he
[50:42] hasn't lost place of you but he knows
[50:44] exactly where you're at and he's going
[50:46] to bring his word to
[50:47] fulfillment in your life is that all
[50:49] right
[50:52] walking in the third day hosea the sixth
[50:56] the sixth chapter if we could turn to
[50:57] that or you could pull it up
[51:04] remember we're talking about laying hold
[51:06] what day are we living in
[51:08] yeah you got that up there
[51:13] yeah yeah
[51:16] sorry if i get a little excited but just
[51:18] just how it comes out with me
[51:27] six one well i got a new bible on the
[51:31] way down here
[51:32] it's not really broken in
[51:35] yeah i'm gonna cheat
[51:39] come and let us return unto the lord for
[51:42] he
[51:42] hath torn
[51:46] you didn't read that wrong he hath torn
[51:49] and he will heal us he has smitten and
[51:52] he will bind us up
[51:54] after two days he will revive us and in
[51:56] the third day
[51:57] he will raise us up and we shall live in
[52:00] his sight
[52:02] we're going through many struggles we've
[52:03] been through many battles and we've been
[52:05] through
[52:05] through our hardships i couldn't imagine
[52:07] there's there's older believers in here
[52:09] that have been through trials i could
[52:10] have never imagined
[52:11] i go through i i don't have kids old
[52:13] enough to be praying for that they'd
[52:14] come back into the fold and i haven't
[52:15] gone through some of those trials but
[52:17] the lord has torn
[52:18] the lord did it not not not just your
[52:20] inability or your lack of faith or
[52:22] don't let satan say it was your unbelief
[52:24] for your mistakes or you turned the
[52:25] wrong direction
[52:26] but the lord had torn but he promised he
[52:28] would heal the lord has smitten but he
[52:31] promised he would bind it up
[52:32] the lord has done these things and he
[52:34] said after two days will i revive
[52:37] that's not an empty promise but we saw a
[52:39] revival after two days
[52:41] we're in a revival that started at the
[52:43] second day
[52:45] something that god promised would come
[52:46] he said i'll i'll i'll tear it apart
[52:49] i'll rip it apart because i'm going to
[52:51] polish it fine
[52:53] but i'll heal it i'll heal the wound
[52:55] over i'll smite it
[52:57] but i'll bind it up and then i'll revive
[52:59] it
[53:00] remember i will restore but in the third
[53:04] day
[53:05] what day are we living in friends in the
[53:07] third day
[53:09] i will raise it up i will raise up a
[53:12] people
[53:13] that will manifest the very works that
[53:16] will manifest the very word that i
[53:17] promised
[53:18] not just a just an empty letter but a
[53:21] manifestation in power
[53:22] and demonstration and god did not take
[53:24] mark 16 out of the bible he did not take
[53:26] the nine spiritual gifts out of the
[53:28] bible
[53:28] if anybody took that out it was man and
[53:30] it was man alone because god
[53:32] changes not those things are still in
[53:34] the bible
[53:35] am i right those things are still in
[53:38] hebrews 13
[53:38] 8. god changes not they shall lay their
[53:42] hands on the sick
[53:43] and they shall recover that did not die
[53:45] in 1965
[53:46] the ability for god to heal i've seen
[53:48] god do so much in just my short life
[53:51] i've seen him do miracle after miracle
[53:53] after miracle
[53:54] and you don't need to be overseas to see
[53:56] it it can happen right here in america
[53:58] it can happen right here in your life it
[54:00] can happen right in your own family
[54:04] i think just in the moment if i could
[54:06] just share another brother's testimony
[54:08] that's all right my i i have a friend
[54:10] brother brother wayne lawson made me
[54:12] know him and he was preaching in in
[54:13] louisiana one wednesday night
[54:15] just seemed like an insignificant
[54:16] wednesday night he was actually down
[54:18] there
[54:18] to work on the church for the for the
[54:20] new building so he wasn't even down
[54:21] there to preach and they said well
[54:22] you're gonna preach for us
[54:24] and he was just preaching a regular old
[54:25] message and he began to preach
[54:28] and just barely touched on the prodigals
[54:30] just touched on the prodigals but a
[54:31] young sister there maybe you know this
[54:33] story young sister there
[54:34] rose up and came up in the prayer line
[54:36] they had a prayer line for two and a
[54:38] half hours on a wednesday night
[54:40] you got to want it and and that sister
[54:44] began a kid came up just a young girl
[54:45] and she said i want to stand for my
[54:47] brother
[54:47] he's out in the world he's falling away
[54:49] from church he's he's for
[54:50] forgotten the faith he's just a young
[54:52] man and he's troubled and i just want to
[54:54] stand for him and claim that promise
[54:56] and they began to pray over him and the
[54:57] brothers and and and she went on and
[54:59] began to kneel at the altar and pray
[55:01] and about 20 minutes later a car rolls
[55:04] up in the parking lot and a guy runs out
[55:06] in his pajamas the doors opened the car
[55:08] he took out a stop sign in the way in
[55:10] the parking lot
[55:11] and he runs in the church in his pajamas
[55:13] and runs up to the front of the church
[55:14] and openly gives his heart to the lord
[55:16] and it was that girl's brother
[55:18] now you tell me what did that
[55:22] he goes to brother tim's if you want to
[55:23] ask him he still goes to church
[55:25] his name's justin he said he woke up in
[55:29] the middle of the night and his family
[55:30] wasn't home and it was wednesday night
[55:31] and they were supposed to be home and
[55:32] here it was midnight nobody was home
[55:34] he said they were at church he said i
[55:35] missed the rapture
[55:37] i missed it and he said i fear gripped
[55:39] him so tight said i've missed
[55:41] i knew the truth i knew that it was the
[55:43] truth i knew that that was the right
[55:44] thing and i've missed it
[55:46] he ran to his car and he drove as fast
[55:48] as he could to the church and gave his
[55:49] heart to the lord
[55:50] now you asked me what did that but a
[55:52] light came forth
[55:53] a light woke him up it was the evening
[55:55] life
[55:58] if god could do it for justin god can do
[56:01] it for you if god could do it for justin
[56:03] he could do it for your son
[56:04] and your daughter and your loved one and
[56:06] your cousin and your mother and your
[56:07] father
[56:08] he could do it for whoever whosoever
[56:10] will
[56:12] we got to recognize what day we're
[56:14] living in this
[56:16] is the day that the lord has made and i
[56:19] will rejoice
[56:20] and be glad of it this is the day not
[56:22] tomorrow not yesterday but right now
[56:25] a right now gospel
[56:29] those things did not die back in the day
[56:31] well you you've been around this is a
[56:32] missionary-minded church you probably
[56:34] have more testimonies than i do but just
[56:35] in my short life
[56:37] i've seen god do amazing things heal
[56:40] families
[56:41] heal marriages restore bodies
[56:44] straighten out crooked legs raise people
[56:46] from wheelchairs
[56:47] raise people from the dead yes in this
[56:50] day in this hour we live in why because
[56:52] he's god
[56:53] and he changes not his word change is
[56:56] not
[56:56] it's just as powerful today as it was
[57:00] 75 years ago it's just as powerful today
[57:03] as it was when he walked in the flesh
[57:05] and he ate with the disciples and he
[57:07] said if that will be clean that can be
[57:09] clean
[57:09] it's just as powerful today
[57:13] i was in a meeting in uganda some time
[57:15] ago and a young man came up
[57:17] for prayer and he had epilepsy said he
[57:19] had it since he was four years old he
[57:21] was about 20
[57:22] 22 years old he said he's had it since
[57:24] he was four just breaking his seizures
[57:26] and
[57:26] and just you know have you know what it
[57:28] is epilepsy
[57:30] and he had had caesar so strong that his
[57:32] eyes were loose in his head
[57:33] and his eye would roll back didn't speak
[57:36] english
[57:37] had to speak to an interpreter had never
[57:39] been
[57:40] to a message church before i don't even
[57:42] know if he'd been to a christian church
[57:43] before
[57:44] he actually came in from kenya brother
[57:45] he came over from the kenya border into
[57:47] uganda and he's
[57:48] he said somebody invited me and went out
[57:50] and witnessed to me and said if you come
[57:52] to these meetings
[57:52] you'll meet the lord and through the
[57:55] interpreter he said i don't know
[57:57] all everything you've been preaching and
[57:58] some of it's confusing to me he said
[58:00] but if if that god that you're preaching
[58:02] can heal me
[58:03] then i'll believe him and i just use the
[58:05] words of the prophet right back at him i
[58:07] said if what i preach to you is the
[58:09] truth
[58:10] and god will vindicate himself to you
[58:12] will you serve him and love him all your
[58:14] days
[58:15] would you believe this is the truth with
[58:16] all your heart because he'll heal you if
[58:18] you want it
[58:19] and you know that i wouldn't be telling
[58:21] this story if he didn't get healed
[58:26] and the men of god we began to lay our
[58:28] hands on him we began to pray and we
[58:30] began to rebuke that spirit
[58:31] and that spirit got up out of him and
[58:33] left him and his eyeball went straight
[58:36] his eyeball went straight in front of
[58:38] him the same god today
[58:40] as he was then he's still hebrews 13 8.
[58:45] if he can do it for him what could he do
[58:48] for you
[58:49] if he could do it for somebody that
[58:50] doesn't know anything about it he just
[58:52] walks in blindly to the faith and he
[58:54] says
[58:54] oh yeah i'd receive it if he'd heal me
[58:56] what about you who know these things
[58:58] who know that god's a healer who know
[59:00] that god's a savior
[59:01] who know that god has touched you he's
[59:03] he sparked something in your life and
[59:05] maybe it's been years gone by
[59:06] since your last holy ghost experience
[59:08] but he's the still
[59:10] the same god today he still lights fires
[59:14] he still he still least releases the
[59:16] captive
[59:17] he's still sets free i'm a witness
[59:21] me and brother joe we're talking about
[59:22] living witnesses that were there to see
[59:24] these signs and when brother branham was
[59:26] here in the cloud and these different
[59:27] things and
[59:28] as i went to bed that night i was just
[59:29] thinking man that would have been
[59:30] awesome and
[59:31] something just came by me and said you
[59:32] are a living witness i
[59:34] am a living witness that this message is
[59:36] the truth i am a living witness that is
[59:38] still the same word today as it always
[59:40] has been
[59:41] it still has the same power today as it
[59:44] always has
[59:45] it's by our faith church cleophas and
[59:48] his friend were walking along the way
[59:50] discouraged
[59:51] discouraged in themselves a great trail
[59:53] of discouragement
[59:56] and then a light comes forth and one of
[59:59] them just starts walking along with him
[1:00:00] where'd he come from right he just came
[1:00:03] out of the bushes seemingly
[1:00:04] that dimension just and he begins
[1:00:07] walking with him
[1:00:09] but what are you talking about well
[1:00:13] what do you mean what do you mean what
[1:00:14] are we talking about do you not know
[1:00:16] are you are you a foreigner are you from
[1:00:18] another world
[1:00:20] and he says what things what things
[1:00:25] friend that's what it's like when we
[1:00:26] we're so troubled in our mind and
[1:00:28] we see no way out there the the the the
[1:00:31] son of man is standing in our presence
[1:00:34] there he's here he meets us he meets us
[1:00:36] every time we come together
[1:00:38] he meets us every time we call on him
[1:00:40] and yet our battle is still too hard for
[1:00:42] him to overcome what things
[1:00:45] what was that again that was so
[1:00:46] troubling to you what was that again
[1:00:48] that was
[1:00:49] that was driving you to the end of your
[1:00:50] rope and you're just about to give up
[1:00:52] what was that
[1:00:53] what things and they began to tell them
[1:00:56] all these things
[1:00:57] oh is that so they began to fellowship
[1:01:00] and
[1:01:01] he began to just drop little nuggets to
[1:01:03] him
[1:01:04] here and there here and there remember
[1:01:06] this is the second stage
[1:01:08] of the third day in the evening time
[1:01:10] they begin to walk
[1:01:12] you know how far it is to emmaus seven
[1:01:14] miles
[1:01:15] they begin to walk seven miles and just
[1:01:17] little nuggets begin to get dropped out
[1:01:18] and little faith building things and
[1:01:20] little things that that he's the same
[1:01:22] yesterday today and forever and and just
[1:01:24] like the shunammite woman he can come to
[1:01:26] you and
[1:01:26] and just these little things and he
[1:01:27] began to go back to all the prophets had
[1:01:29] taught
[1:01:30] and began to encourage their hearts
[1:01:33] that's why we can't forsake the
[1:01:34] assembling of ourselves together
[1:01:36] all that the prophets had taught and
[1:01:38] began to encourage
[1:01:39] their hearts and they began to rise up
[1:01:41] in faith and they began to walk down the
[1:01:42] road and and all of a sudden they really
[1:01:44] liked this guy that came out of nowhere
[1:01:46] seemingly and
[1:01:46] it's time for him to go but you know
[1:01:48] what they did they laid hold of him
[1:01:50] they didn't let him go they said come
[1:01:52] come come visit with us and come in to
[1:01:54] sup with us and and i wonder how many
[1:01:56] times that he's been right here in the
[1:01:57] middle of this aisle
[1:01:58] and we haven't constrained him to come
[1:02:00] to our problem and to come to our need
[1:02:03] and to come to our household and to come
[1:02:05] fix our marriage
[1:02:06] and to come fix our thoughts how many
[1:02:08] times has he walked right by us and we
[1:02:09] just let him go
[1:02:10] but you gotta lay hold lord
[1:02:13] he won't walk by forever but he's here
[1:02:16] today
[1:02:16] his grace is still open today we've got
[1:02:18] to lay hold of the manifested word of
[1:02:21] god
[1:02:21] he's here he's not coming he's here
[1:02:24] [Applause]
[1:02:30] and it constrained him to come in
[1:02:32] cleophas
[1:02:34] and his friend and it was by the way he
[1:02:37] broke the bread right
[1:02:39] the prophecy was fulfilled by the way
[1:02:43] that he broke the bread unto them they
[1:02:45] received the same authority as esther
[1:02:47] did by the way
[1:02:49] he broke the bread unto them
[1:02:52] recognizing what day we're living in and
[1:02:53] in the third day
[1:02:55] i will raise it up
[1:02:59] yes they knew there was something
[1:03:01] different about him
[1:03:03] they could feel a different presence in
[1:03:04] him they could feel something different
[1:03:06] and
[1:03:07] just the faith that was given to them
[1:03:09] but when he broke the bread
[1:03:11] in the evening time their eyes
[1:03:15] we're open
[1:03:18] what day are we living in
[1:03:22] remember in john 16 he gives the same
[1:03:25] prophecy
[1:03:27] he says there's coming to time yet a
[1:03:28] little while the world will see me no
[1:03:30] more but you still see me
[1:03:32] and in that day in that day friends
[1:03:34] we're not living in some in
[1:03:36] somebody else's day we're living in our
[1:03:38] day
[1:03:39] this is our time this is our moment
[1:03:42] where's our faith at i know i know it's
[1:03:44] in there i can preach to you straight
[1:03:46] because i know
[1:03:47] god puts you here to be an overcomer
[1:03:49] there's got to be something that will
[1:03:51] activate our faith
[1:03:52] that will let us rise up and say i'm not
[1:03:54] going to take what satan gives me
[1:03:56] but i am a child of god i'm a daughter
[1:03:58] of god i don't have to take what satan
[1:04:00] gives me
[1:04:01] he doesn't have dominion in my mind or
[1:04:03] god said i could have a sound mind
[1:04:06] i don't know i don't know everybody here
[1:04:08] enough to preach to your problems but i
[1:04:10] i know the lord is
[1:04:12] he's able maybe some of us are battling
[1:04:16] with confusion in her mind and
[1:04:18] maybe somebody's come and sown some
[1:04:20] seeds of unbelief and some discord and
[1:04:22] we're unsure and
[1:04:24] even in our mind we'd never admit it but
[1:04:25] we're questioning yeah
[1:04:28] but you know it just takes one light one
[1:04:31] light to pierce through that darkness
[1:04:33] one light to set it up i you know
[1:04:35] brother brown said that the hardest
[1:04:37] thing for god to do
[1:04:38] was to get one mortal man to believe
[1:04:41] another
[1:04:42] but yet that seems the easiest thing for
[1:04:44] satan to do
[1:04:47] he just spread a little drop a little
[1:04:49] line here and before you know it it's
[1:04:51] it's this huge rumor out there somewhere
[1:04:54] so a little discord here and
[1:04:55] before you know it the people are weak
[1:04:56] in faith and you know it's just so a
[1:04:59] little negativity there and
[1:05:01] seems to be really easy for him to do
[1:05:04] but
[1:05:04] we are an elected people
[1:05:10] said that you were predestinated to
[1:05:12] receive him in this age in this
[1:05:14] age we were designed to receive this
[1:05:17] word
[1:05:18] we were built to receive this word we
[1:05:20] were made to receive it
[1:05:22] we were made to manifest it not anybody
[1:05:25] else
[1:05:26] us seems to be
[1:05:29] seems to be easy for satan to come in
[1:05:31] with an unvindicated word and
[1:05:33] unvindicated ministry and so seeds of
[1:05:35] doubt and before you know it
[1:05:37] our mind starts teetering right right
[1:05:41] that's right tempted in all things
[1:05:44] if thou be if thou be the son of god
[1:05:48] if thou be who who did that who was that
[1:05:52] tempted in all things like we are
[1:05:56] you know brother branham was walking
[1:05:57] with a friend one time i don't know how
[1:05:59] long i've been up here but i'm gonna
[1:06:00] cut some of this out brother branham was
[1:06:03] was in a vision
[1:06:05] remember he was walking with a friend
[1:06:08] he never named the friend said he was
[1:06:10] walking with a friend can we just read
[1:06:12] the quote
[1:06:16] praise the lord right then as i sat
[1:06:18] there
[1:06:19] a little bit this is out of paradox a
[1:06:21] side of this chair then all of a sudden
[1:06:23] hear it come again
[1:06:24] then i knew that it was a vision and
[1:06:26] then when i come into the vision again
[1:06:28] it seemed that i was lifted up
[1:06:30] and sitting on a highway a narrow way
[1:06:32] with some brother
[1:06:34] i never knew who the brother was i
[1:06:36] looked around i said now i am sure and
[1:06:38] know this is the vision
[1:06:39] the lord god is here and it seemed like
[1:06:41] everybody was afraid
[1:06:43] said what's everybody so afraid of
[1:06:47] almost like brother brandon was stepping
[1:06:48] into a situation where it was already
[1:06:50] unfolding and it was already going on
[1:06:52] and he comes down into in a vision into
[1:06:54] the middle of a situation
[1:06:56] where everyone is afraid and a voice
[1:06:59] came and said
[1:07:00] there is such danger in these days
[1:07:02] there's a great hideous thing that's
[1:07:05] death when it strikes you and i heard
[1:07:08] the weeds mashing down
[1:07:10] trail of the serpent and i looked and
[1:07:12] here come a huge monster snake
[1:07:15] crawling through the weeds and i thought
[1:07:17] now knowing this is a vision that i
[1:07:19] shall see what this animal is
[1:07:21] or this beast is and he crawled up on
[1:07:23] the highway and as soon as i
[1:07:25] as soon as i got sight of him i knew it
[1:07:27] was a mamba
[1:07:29] now a mamba is an african snake which is
[1:07:31] the most deadly biden
[1:07:32] of all things there is there's nothing
[1:07:34] as poison as a mamba and the snake of
[1:07:36] course represents
[1:07:37] sin death see in division now remember
[1:07:40] brother brown is an outdoorsman god
[1:07:42] speaks to him in things like snakes and
[1:07:44] squirrels and and things of the outdoors
[1:07:46] and waters and rivers and fish and lures
[1:07:49] and
[1:07:49] this mamba represents something it's the
[1:07:52] deadliest thing there is
[1:07:55] it's eternal death
[1:08:00] represents sin and death and there that
[1:08:02] we have of this country the rattlesnake
[1:08:04] and the copperhead the
[1:08:05] cottonmouth moccasin many of those
[1:08:06] snakes that if you're in bad health
[1:08:08] and one would bite you it would perhaps
[1:08:11] kill you
[1:08:12] if you're weak in faith and one would
[1:08:14] bite you
[1:08:15] it would perhaps kill you but if you
[1:08:17] didn't get aid of some sort right of way
[1:08:19] and then if we go into africa and india
[1:08:21] we find that the cobra there's a black
[1:08:23] cobra he's a bad snake he's a death bite
[1:08:25] there's the yellow cobra which is far
[1:08:27] beyond him and the yellow cobra the
[1:08:29] patient dies with such a horrible death
[1:08:31] and you think why am i reading all this
[1:08:32] because
[1:08:33] god's god talks and types
[1:08:40] it dies from suffocation it paralyzes
[1:08:42] the breathing system
[1:08:43] and they can't breathe they just open
[1:08:45] their mouth and gap and trying to
[1:08:47] and die like that and that was the type
[1:08:48] of snake was just one look from getting
[1:08:50] billy paul when we got the snake in
[1:08:52] africa
[1:08:53] and then comes the mamba he's death
[1:08:57] he's so fast you can't see him he goes
[1:09:00] over the top of the weeds and propels
[1:09:02] himself
[1:09:03] with the back of his tail just
[1:09:06] whoosh and he's gone hits you in the
[1:09:08] face usually stands up high
[1:09:10] and strikes hard and then when he hits
[1:09:12] you you just got a few breaths till
[1:09:14] you're finished
[1:09:15] turn real it don't only paralyze you it
[1:09:17] gets in the bloodstream
[1:09:19] it gets in the nerves everything you
[1:09:22] just die
[1:09:23] in just a few seconds them native boys
[1:09:25] and track boys you can't say mamba and
[1:09:27] they'll butt their heads together and
[1:09:28] scream because it's
[1:09:29] death just in a few seconds see when one
[1:09:32] hits you
[1:09:33] i don't know i'm not a snake expert by
[1:09:35] any means but have you ever seen a black
[1:09:36] mamba
[1:09:38] they're not black they're gray
[1:09:41] they're in between white and black
[1:09:42] they're they're a gray color an
[1:09:44] uncertain color there's something that
[1:09:45] can blend in real well with anything and
[1:09:47] but why they call them a black mambas
[1:09:49] because when they open their mouth it's
[1:09:50] pitch black
[1:09:51] it's like outer darkness black i mean
[1:09:53] it's ink black when they open their
[1:09:55] mouth
[1:09:55] it's something in there is the blackest
[1:09:57] i've ever seen if you've ever seen a
[1:09:59] picture of a black mama with his mouth
[1:10:00] open
[1:10:01] i mean it's black black that's why
[1:10:03] they're called the black mama but in
[1:10:05] color
[1:10:05] they seem like they're not that
[1:10:07] dangerous they're not brightly colored
[1:10:08] they're not yellow they're not
[1:10:09] they're not this glossy black they're
[1:10:11] just a gray snake but yet they possess
[1:10:13] the most deadly bite now why is that
[1:10:17] come on you know when a mamba bites you
[1:10:21] its venom is going straight to your
[1:10:23] heart it works on the nervous system and
[1:10:26] the nervous system is the fastest way
[1:10:28] that it can get to that heart muscle it
[1:10:30] works on your nerves
[1:10:33] come on come on
[1:10:37] reach brother yep yes come on
[1:10:41] come on brother god god never intended
[1:10:44] for you to be afraid
[1:10:46] or for you to be sad there you go that's
[1:10:49] black black
[1:10:50] right on brother joe
[1:10:57] man nasty i'd be afraid
[1:11:01] i'd be scared of it but god
[1:11:04] talks and types so why would he use
[1:11:07] something like that
[1:11:08] something that just blended in with
[1:11:09] everything else if fellowship may be
[1:11:11] with everybody else
[1:11:13] brother bam said he would send somebody
[1:11:14] that would have a toxin with him and
[1:11:16] come into fellowship and
[1:11:17] rub shoulders and visit and talk and
[1:11:20] shake hands and hug
[1:11:21] and get a relationship and you exchange
[1:11:23] phone numbers and all of a sudden he's a
[1:11:26] black mamba
[1:11:27] [Applause]
[1:11:35] come on mamba's
[1:11:40] venom is cardiotoxic leading directly
[1:11:44] to the heart
[1:11:50] stands up like a man when it strikes too
[1:11:53] and here he was on the highway and i
[1:11:54] thought well this is it
[1:11:56] so i looked at him and he looked angry
[1:11:58] at me and he licked his tongue
[1:12:00] and here he come but when he got right
[1:12:02] close to me he would run up fast
[1:12:04] and then he would get slower and slower
[1:12:06] and just quiver
[1:12:08] and stop then something would hold him
[1:12:10] off he couldn't bite me
[1:12:11] he would turn around on the other side
[1:12:13] try to approach from this side and he
[1:12:14] would get back and get us started and
[1:12:16] swish right towards me and get slower
[1:12:18] and slower and slower and then to a stop
[1:12:23] and then he would shake like that and
[1:12:25] move back he couldn't
[1:12:26] strike me remember one time when a snake
[1:12:30] like that struck a prophet of god before
[1:12:32] it didn't end well for him remember that
[1:12:34] remember when paul reached his hand and
[1:12:36] he was gathering wood
[1:12:37] and that and they say it was an ad or
[1:12:39] possibly a mamba struck him on the arm
[1:12:41] and he shook
[1:12:42] it loose you know brother brown said he
[1:12:43] couldn't die because his blood
[1:12:45] was too rich that snake had a fear in
[1:12:48] him
[1:12:49] of the of something that was inside that
[1:12:51] man even in a vision something inside
[1:12:53] that man was
[1:12:54] was so was so fearsome to that snake
[1:12:58] mambas don't back down to anything you
[1:13:00] go out in the wild they don't run they
[1:13:01] don't retreat because they are the
[1:13:03] ultimate predator out there but when it
[1:13:05] came to a prophet of god
[1:13:06] who recognized his authority who knew
[1:13:09] where he was standing that snake
[1:13:10] couldn't do it
[1:13:11] couldn't get to him couldn't attack him
[1:13:14] he'd already made that mistake once
[1:13:16] remember on calvary when he made that
[1:13:18] mistake and he said now i've got him
[1:13:20] i'm going to cut right into him i'm
[1:13:22] going to get him and his stinger was
[1:13:24] pulled out
[1:13:27] watch this though and then he turned
[1:13:31] and looked at my friend and the way he
[1:13:34] went
[1:13:35] after my friend and i see my friend just
[1:13:38] jumping way in the air and
[1:13:39] over him and over him trying and the
[1:13:41] thing was striking at him i thought oh
[1:13:43] if it ever hits him it'll be an instant
[1:13:45] death no wonder everybody's so scared
[1:13:47] because when this thing hits you it's an
[1:13:48] instant death
[1:13:50] and it was just striking at him like
[1:13:51] that and i threw my hands and i said oh
[1:13:53] god have mercy on my brother
[1:13:55] i said if that serpent ever strikes him
[1:13:57] it'll kill him
[1:13:58] and just then the serpent turned to me
[1:14:00] when i said that and looked at me again
[1:14:02] and a voice came from above and said you
[1:14:04] have been given power to bind him
[1:14:08] the worst or any
[1:14:12] thank you come on friends where'd that
[1:14:14] voice come from you have been given
[1:14:16] power to bind him or worse or any
[1:14:20] and i said well god what must i do and
[1:14:23] i've heard this quote
[1:14:24] just preached to me and preached to me
[1:14:26] and preached to me in myself just
[1:14:28] feeling so condemned
[1:14:29] and he said there's one thing you must
[1:14:30] do you must be more sincere
[1:14:33] see you must be more sincere and i've
[1:14:35] been stuck there for so many years i had
[1:14:37] been stuck there
[1:14:38] i've got to be more sincere it's by my
[1:14:40] works i've got to get there i've got to
[1:14:42] crawl on my knees i've got to bear a
[1:14:43] cross i've got to
[1:14:44] you know how we do in our mind you know
[1:14:46] we think i've just got to be so
[1:14:47] spiritual
[1:14:49] but look how the prophet settles it i
[1:14:51] said well god
[1:14:52] forgive me for my own sincerity and let
[1:14:55] me have sincerity
[1:14:57] and when i raised up my hands to him
[1:15:00] again there was a great something came
[1:15:02] over me just lifted me up
[1:15:03] seemed like that my whole body was
[1:15:05] charged with something
[1:15:09] now you can't get upset at me for
[1:15:11] getting a little excited in church
[1:15:12] because
[1:15:13] i've had connection with my theophany a
[1:15:15] time or two i i know that it's out there
[1:15:17] and i felt its touch at time or two and
[1:15:19] you know what brother brown says
[1:15:20] it energizes you it gives you a jolt of
[1:15:23] something in your body that you know you
[1:15:24] make connection
[1:15:25] with a supernatural being and you feel
[1:15:28] like shouting you feel like getting a
[1:15:29] little excited
[1:15:30] you feel that holy ghost power come in
[1:15:32] your life because there's a you out
[1:15:34] there
[1:15:34] that's not of this world
[1:15:44] charged with something and i looked at
[1:15:47] the serpent and he started towards me
[1:15:48] and he couldn't do it
[1:15:50] yet and i said satan in the name of the
[1:15:53] lord jesus christ
[1:15:55] i bind you and the serpent a blue smoke
[1:15:59] flew out of him and he curled up and
[1:16:01] made that sign like a s
[1:16:02] capital s made backwards and an ant
[1:16:06] sign and means bind this one
[1:16:10] or anything below him
[1:16:14] because he was the worst
[1:16:17] blue smoke fell out of him and his tail
[1:16:20] choked his own self
[1:16:22] that's why when you said that today i
[1:16:23] got so his tail
[1:16:25] choked his own self around his head when
[1:16:28] he made this s
[1:16:29] backwards and that sign like a
[1:16:31] conjunction you see
[1:16:32] it choked it to death and the brother
[1:16:36] went free
[1:16:40] questions and answers somebody asked
[1:16:42] brother branham will you please explain
[1:16:44] to me
[1:16:44] matthew 10 41 what is it to have a
[1:16:47] prophet's reward
[1:16:48] what is his reply he says you're the
[1:16:50] friend of a prophet
[1:16:52] you see him and a friend were walking
[1:16:54] down the highway
[1:16:55] and the prophet's reward was to speak
[1:16:57] for his brother and say
[1:16:59] satan i bind you in the name of the lord
[1:17:01] jesus christ
[1:17:03] i will not be ashamed of this message i
[1:17:05] will not be ashamed of this messenger
[1:17:07] i will not take a backseat and back up
[1:17:09] on what i believe because
[1:17:10] i am a friend of the prophet maybe he
[1:17:14] never knew me but he came into this
[1:17:16] vision he said i didn't know the brother
[1:17:18] but i stepped into a situation
[1:17:20] and everybody was afraid
[1:17:24] [Music]
[1:17:26] what is it to have a province reward
[1:17:28] it's not just to rub shoulders with him
[1:17:30] it's not to shine his tires
[1:17:31] it's not to to buy them red hots
[1:17:36] i bind you in the name
[1:17:39] of the lord jesus christ
[1:17:43] and the snake formed himself like into a
[1:17:45] pitcher
[1:17:46] remember we read in revelations earlier
[1:17:48] this morning and he cast out of his
[1:17:50] mouth like waters
[1:17:52] he was pouring like a picture like a
[1:17:54] pitcher a water pitcher
[1:17:56] and he formed into this picture and
[1:17:58] brother brown said
[1:18:00] and he just in the blue smoke to think
[1:18:04] that the worst of them all was was was
[1:18:08] tied up in just a few simple words
[1:18:12] can i take it out of another angle and
[1:18:14] he told me i had seen a big mambo
[1:18:16] running that's an african snake he was
[1:18:18] trying to kill people
[1:18:19] it was after my brother and i screamed
[1:18:21] out oh god what can i do
[1:18:23] he said you've been given power to bind
[1:18:25] him said be of good courage i spoke to
[1:18:27] him and his tail went up in the air
[1:18:29] and whirled around and just like this
[1:18:31] pitch pitcher handle here
[1:18:33] he choked himself to death blue smoke
[1:18:35] flew out of him
[1:18:36] next morning when i woke up i was laying
[1:18:38] there said i better get up and take the
[1:18:40] children to school
[1:18:41] i looked over and there was a hideous
[1:18:42] looking thing looked like it was alley
[1:18:45] hoop
[1:18:46] in the funny paper great big horn
[1:18:48] sticking out of it he was going sound
[1:18:49] like a hen cackling or singing
[1:18:52] like they're going from the barn and i
[1:18:53] looked at it wasn't that funny it
[1:18:54] sounded like a chicken
[1:18:56] i said me to honey media she didn't wake
[1:18:58] up and i thought yeah that that scared
[1:18:59] her to death i waited there just a
[1:19:01] minute to stand and watch
[1:19:03] people talk about devils and don't even
[1:19:04] know what they are sometime that right
[1:19:06] but you run headlong into them every
[1:19:08] day maybe but you will notice
[1:19:11] and after a while he was accusing me
[1:19:16] said you have no power with god how many
[1:19:19] times has that been thrown across your
[1:19:22] your thoughts i would say it's your
[1:19:23] thought but it's been thrown across your
[1:19:25] thoughts
[1:19:26] thrown into your mind you have no power
[1:19:28] with god
[1:19:29] you're not sincere enough you're just a
[1:19:32] bluff
[1:19:34] you have no power and i said satan
[1:19:37] you're an offense to me get out of my
[1:19:39] way in the name of jesus christ
[1:19:41] and he left now friend i don't know what
[1:19:44] you're at i don't know where you're at
[1:19:45] or what you're struggling with and
[1:19:46] i really feel that that god's just
[1:19:48] pulling on there's there's there's
[1:19:50] some people in here that have been bound
[1:19:51] in their mind afraid to step afraid to
[1:19:54] walk
[1:19:54] afraid to venture out in their faith
[1:19:56] afraid to take god at his word
[1:19:58] may be afraid to use a gift that god
[1:19:59] gave you afraid to be vulnerable in
[1:20:01] front of the people of god
[1:20:02] afraid of something but you have the
[1:20:05] power to bind it in the name of jesus
[1:20:07] christ
[1:20:09] that's not presuming without authority
[1:20:11] but it's a promise given by the prophet
[1:20:13] you have the power to bind
[1:20:16] him or any worse thing
[1:20:20] we're not venturing without authority
[1:20:21] we're not taking a misstep or walking on

[1:22:05] our ears
[1:22:07] we're not waiting for another time to
[1:22:08] come i'm that friend that was walking
[1:22:10] with cleophas
[1:22:12] and he began to break the word of life
[1:22:14] to me and he began to take the veil off
[1:22:16] of my eyes
[1:22:18] and i began to see there's a light
[1:22:20] there's a light coming forth
[1:22:22] and i heard a voice say arise shine
[1:22:25] thy light has come this is your day this
[1:22:28] is your time
[1:22:29] this is your anointing get in the flow
[1:22:32] of the anointing of god it's not just
[1:22:33] for another age far out there but it's
[1:22:35] right now
[1:22:36] are we the bride of christ is this not
[1:22:39] our h
[1:22:39] is this not our time is this not an
[1:22:41] overcoming time
[1:22:44] we should be the most victorious people
[1:22:46] on earth of course we're going through
[1:22:48] battle
[1:22:49] of course we're fighting but we're
[1:22:52] victorious
[1:22:54] you were predestinated to overcome him
[1:22:58] in this age
[1:23:06] god knows how many struggles you've been
[1:23:09] through in your life
[1:23:11] untold untold hurdles
[1:23:16] so many sacrifices made so many loved
[1:23:20] ones
[1:23:21] pains you it hurts you he's torn
[1:23:24] yeah and he's smitten yeah
[1:23:27] but he said he'd revive it
[1:23:31] he said he'd bind up he said he'd bring
[1:23:34] restoration
[1:23:36] he said we could receive a prophet's
[1:23:39] reward
[1:23:40] you see what was different about those
[1:23:41] two is they tarried long enough
[1:23:43] to see the manifestation of the third
[1:23:45] pole they didn't have to fake it
[1:23:47] they didn't have to go make something
[1:23:48] out of it they tarried long enough with
[1:23:50] the word
[1:23:51] until they saw it come to pass in their
[1:23:53] life
[1:23:56] it's in the third day yeah i believe
[1:23:59] we're in the evening light
[1:24:00] i believe the evening light has come i
[1:24:02] believe there's been a light that
[1:24:03] shot through the darkness of laodicea
[1:24:05] it's shot through the darkness of this
[1:24:07] chaos around us when the world seems so
[1:24:09] uncertain and
[1:24:10] and and the government and don't think
[1:24:11] that you're settled in yourself
[1:24:14] we had an 11-day conflict with israel
[1:24:16] and hamas a while back
[1:24:17] that could have been it right that could
[1:24:20] have been it
[1:24:20] yeah i mean the united states was that
[1:24:22] close to turning their back on israel
[1:24:26] under the under the name of humanity and
[1:24:28] humanitarianism
[1:24:32] this world is setting itself up
[1:24:35] but the bride is taking herself up
[1:24:41] i'm not of this world i'm not of this
[1:24:43] chaos
[1:24:44] [Applause]
[1:24:45] we have to recognize the day that we're
[1:24:47] living
[1:24:48] i believe we do as a church friends
[1:24:52] satan you're an offense to me
[1:24:56] that seems too simple brother it worked
[1:24:59] for him
[1:25:00] not only did it work for him it worked
[1:25:03] for his friend
[1:25:07] [Music]
[1:25:09] satan is attacking the faith in this
[1:25:12] message so hard
[1:25:14] yeah and we know there'd be a shaking of
[1:25:17] a tree
[1:25:18] and there'd be those fall away and those
[1:25:20] stand
[1:25:22] but he's shaking that so hard why
[1:25:26] because he knows what a prophet's reward
[1:25:28] is
[1:25:30] i can't get to him if they're under the
[1:25:32] coverage
[1:25:34] of that light
[1:25:39] this evening light this fourth light
[1:25:41] that we're living in
[1:25:43] will drive back any enemy drive back any
[1:25:45] sickness
[1:25:46] you might be inflicted in your body but
[1:25:48] you don't have to stay that way
[1:25:50] you might be fighting a battle in your
[1:25:51] mind but you don't have to stay that way
[1:25:53] you might be fighting a battle that
[1:25:56] you've never never
[1:25:57] dreamed that you'd have to fight this
[1:25:58] hard but it doesn't have to stay that
[1:26:00] way
[1:26:02] this light that we live in is the gospel
[1:26:05] light amen
[1:26:08] all power all power given if we could
[1:26:10] just stand to our feet
[1:26:14] you know it was on the third day there
[1:26:20] remember the story of of in in in
[1:26:22] memphis
[1:26:24] when the prophet was on his way
[1:26:25] somewhere supposedly you know he thought
[1:26:28] he was just moving in the perfect will
[1:26:29] of god but god had other plans
[1:26:31] and his plane came down and grounded
[1:26:33] itself and
[1:26:35] he began to walk and you know you could
[1:26:36] go through the whole story and see how
[1:26:38] he turned this way and turn that was
[1:26:39] just listening to the voice
[1:26:41] that still small voice and there he
[1:26:43] comes across a woman who's leaning over
[1:26:46] her fence
[1:26:48] she's got a whole rag on her head and
[1:26:49] she's just out in the morning do
[1:26:53] and she says she does something
[1:26:56] that that man's done his whole life yeah
[1:26:59] she tells him who he is she says
[1:27:05] morning parson
[1:27:09] i knew you were coming she tells him
[1:27:12] who he is
[1:27:16] and they're just like the shunamite
[1:27:17] woman
[1:27:23] i skipped over this quote but i'm just
[1:27:25] going to read this part
[1:27:30] they want to know what a prophet's
[1:27:31] reward is it's to be
[1:27:33] a friend to the prophecy that's your
[1:27:35] reward
[1:27:36] he's your friend like the shunamite
[1:27:39] woman
[1:27:40] he says it might come in handy sometimes
[1:27:44] amen she begins to tell him who he is
[1:27:48] all right there you go he said i prayed
[1:27:52] i prayed and here you are
[1:27:55] and him not knowing where he's at or why
[1:27:56] he's there or what's going to take place
[1:27:58] and they walk inside and then they find
[1:28:02] a boy lay down on them we know the story
[1:28:03] is the boy laid out on the bed and he's
[1:28:05] just
[1:28:05] oh it's dark it's dark
[1:28:09] it's dark there's no light
[1:28:14] remember you said earlier there's no god
[1:28:15] there where was he brother bannon had
[1:28:18] been where that boy was at
[1:28:20] oh it's dark oh
[1:28:24] and she says this is the third day
[1:28:28] that he's been like this
[1:28:33] she says would you pray he says well why
[1:28:36] don't you pray first mama
[1:28:40] you know prayers don't have an
[1:28:42] expiration date there's a quote i don't
[1:28:44] have it here but it just comes to me now
[1:28:46] he said there's mama and daddy's prayers
[1:28:48] laying up under the altar
[1:28:50] and they might be years passed on but
[1:28:53] those prayers are still there under the
[1:28:55] altar so your grandma might have prayed
[1:28:57] for you or
[1:28:58] your mama might have prayed for you and
[1:28:59] she might be long gone but those prayers
[1:29:01] are still laying up under the altar
[1:29:03] and that mama began to make connection
[1:29:05] with god and she began to cry out to god
[1:29:07] and
[1:29:07] he said she had talked to him before she
[1:29:10] knew him
[1:29:10] she she knew how to get in contact with
[1:29:12] him she knew how to bring him down
[1:29:14] he said she began to pray out and he
[1:29:15] said lord just heal this young boy
[1:29:20] and it was on the third day that the boy
[1:29:23] came out of the darkness
[1:29:24] he said they're starting starting to get
[1:29:25] light in here i'm starting to see light
[1:29:27] mama what is that it's light
[1:29:29] it's light every time brother brandon
