brothers and sisters greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ may be seated for just a few minutes first and foremost we thank God for this morning we appreciate him because he's the one that gives us life and we appreciate the invitation brother Wade thank you very much brother Samuel here at the pastor here and we believe that the Lord is the one that can help [Music] us God placed in brother Wade's heart to to invite me maybe we're not well-known ministers or preachers but God knows our hearts and so my wife my lovely wife is here with me Wednesday when I told the church that I was coming here I had forgotten to uh to to ask them you know which one how many of you send greetings to the church there and I totally forgot but at the end brother who's been here before he he came up front and he told all the Brethren he said how many of you will send greetings there to Lula so all of them send their greetings here to L they send all their greetings [Music] so brother right now he's in charge at the moment he's he's a calm brother he's he's very serious but thank God we're serving the lord there is not a better thing than to serve the Lord just thank God we believe that he's the only one that can help us so I want to express this morning what God has given us this morning and so those that who have who take notes this morning we want to talk about confronting eternal life and I believe that each and every one of us we're confronting a day or facing a day because we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow but this morning we are face to face with eternal life so if you may stand to your feet we just ask the Lord to guide us he be the one who speaks to our hearts let us bow our heads and let us pray loving Heavenly Father we thank you this morning we believe Lord that you're the only one that can help us Lord I Have Nothing Within Myself to give to my brethren but you do Lord and this morning we believe that you're here because you were the first one invited the first honored guest Lord help us this morning we commit ourselves into your holy hands we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen if you would turn with me to Mark chapter 10 we're going to take this scripture Mark 10 verse 17 we read in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God th knowest the con the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness the fraud not honor thy father and mother and he answered and said unto him master all these have I observed from my youth then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great great possessions and Jesus looked around about and said unto his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God Lord Jesus Christ bless his word may seated it's good to listen to this scripture and read the scripture but believing that each day that goes by we're hopefully we're we're scaling up that we're growing in our walk with God and that's the reason why we come to church because we believe because we want to walk with God amen amen and so this morning we're facing eternal life now when we're here at church we should lay aside all the problems all the weights and the sins that easily beset us because we can be here seated in church but our mind be somewhere else our thoughts could be somewhere else now you see the scripture that we were reading this young man he had everything he had done everything all the Ten Commandments he knew them I think he probably was even wiser than we but one thing that he did not know about he didn't know if he had eternal life or not so how many of us know if we have eternal life or not have we really met the Lord face to face that's a good question because this the question that this young man has what can I do to inherit eternal life and so Jesus told him do you know the Commandments [Music] yes so it's given to us there's been a homework that has been given to us come to church do the things that we need to do as a Christian fulfill the Commandments have we done those maybe we could say yes and so are we following the Lord maybe the the life that we live is what shows that we are following the Lord or trying to now the Lord knows our heart and there is there is something that that I really like there of an older person he he asked he asked a young man he said grandfather he said why do why do you go to church because I like it it's my duty to go to church what did you learn today well I don't know maybe I didn't learn anything that's how we are uh Sometimes some of us why did we not learn something because really we weren't at church we weren't our thoughts were elsewhere maybe the the the the ranchers the people out in the country maybe they were thinking there was a tree that was going to fall on their little house or that their cows were going to go away and that's why they couldn't learn something at church that day now he's going to church every single time and what did you learn I don't know if I did learn something or not so why do you go to church we we call old uh we call them older because the older ones know because the life that they have lived the experience that they have had that's what's made them to know what they know now watch this the Lord oh the the the the the man in this illustration the the the older man he had he had four baskets and in those four baskets there was carbon in those in those baskets do you know how carbon looks like how does carbon look like it has little little bitty pieces in within it I guess and that place where you put those things ingro it looks dark it looks like s s now notice the older man he told the young man go bring me water go bring water okay okay but how am I going to bring water in that basket go go okay all right he takes the basket and he fills it with water and he pulls it out and he takes it and he asks him where is the water the water fell out okay all right go get more water but the water keeps falling out of the basket no no go go get more water okay all right he takes the basket he fills it with water and he tries to bring it to him where is the water where all fell out now compare these baskets with the one that you use to take up the water water is what cleanses right and water is the is compared to the word and so he told him he said look I go to church because I want to be clean I want to be [Applause] washed he said maybe yesterday yesterday I didn't learn but I went to church and yesterday I went to church and I didn't learn but I stay clean what keeps us clean brothers and sisters the word the word keeps us clean and so when we think that what are we doing that what we're doing is not good it's not right why do we come to church and we feel like we're not getting anything We're Here Brothers we're here to learn something from God what are we going to learn from our Lord Jesus Christ he promised us eternal life and in this morning we are facing eternal life if you reject the Lord Jesus Christ today you are facing eternal life and if you reject you have denied the Lord Jesus because as you reject is denying amen amen and so believing that what God has given us so that we can take it take it in our hearts it's eternal life amen amen eternal life brothers and eternal life should be something daily because eternal life that we have we have it before the foundation of the world and so we don't look for it because we have it but this young man he didn't know he didn't know if he had eternal life or not and so when the question is given what should I do what should I do there is a doubt in our hearts and so each one of us that we have believed this precious message for me Brothers is eternal life Amen brother BR said this message is for the bride it's not for anyone else now who is the bride I believe the bride are those that God himself chose before the foundation of the world now we have seven Church ages he planted a seed he planted many seeds in every age and thank God that he he chose us for this last day so that we as seeds come to resurrect to eternal life in this morning aren't you happy for that I'm happy for that that without deserving it he he came to me I didn't come to him the prophet said no one seeks God God is seeking what he planted in the before the foundation of the world blessed be the name of the Lord because you weren't interested in God he was the one that was interested in you because a seed as it grows that eventually will give forth fruit amen amen as you start getting into the things of God and as you start living a different life your fruits are going to be different you're not going to act like the way you used to act you're going to act as a son and daughter of God that's the reason amen he chose you to be a son and daughter of God blessed be the name of the Lord how many are happy this morning [Applause] amen you forgive me that I speak Spanish but thank the Lord this brother speaks Spanish very well as well we should be thankful for this brother amen praise the Lord so as I as I said God In His Infinite plan he thought of you he thought of me because even while we were in in sins and and uh in our downfalls he chose us he chose us for what to be for eternal life for eternal life have you ever asked yourself Lord I want to have eternal life have you ever asked that now why does the question come why does that question come come to you you've paid your tithes you've obeyed the Lord but why does that question come to you it's something to think about why do I ask myself do I have eternal life am right amen now when that question comes to you we should have we should be very careful very careful Judas had the be the greatest Master around him Peter all the apostles they had the the master with them they faced eternal life personally Peter but maybe was a liar and what about us what are we have we denied the Lord yes see yeah the Lord Jesus Christ knows when Peter was very excited and he told Jesus he said I'll go with you until death I'm going to defend you Lord in in his own desires he tried he wanted to defend the [Music] Lord the Lord Jesus told him he said look Peter you're G to deny me and so the question is that that's the that's where the question comes how many times have we in our life Deni the Lord and you're own natural life where I see older people here I see young people here that maybe you ask yourselves the question do I have eternal life now look when Peter was with God I mean when Peter was with the Lord he didn't know he didn't know you know why because he didn't have the Holy Spirit he didn't have the Holy Spirit but in in his own desires and his own impulses he said I'm going to fight for you Lord Jesus but when the Lord Jesus told him Peter you're going to deny me no Lord I will never do that no so the doubt comes in his mind what is it that that you fight with you fight demons day by day and by the grace of God brothers and sisters we're here this morning morning by the grace of God it is by nothing else but by the grace of God and so when you overcame this morning you overcame you overcame death you overcame all kinds of different things this morning you're facing eternal life and as you're facing eternal life you have it before you before you and you say Lord I'm going I'm serving you today with all of my heart I'm going to serve you with all of my heart but maybe tomorrow we forget of our promise that we made the Lord you remember that when Peter was there he was hiding himself aren't you one of the ones that are following Jesus no no and do you know why they recognize him because of the way he dressed see yeah and so you and I we have we have a a pattern that even if we wanted to because there is your free moral agency right there brother brandham said sisters remember that I told you that you don't have to cut your hair because that's going to help you that's going to help you so but it's a it's a choice you can do it you can do it the any man each and every one of us have free m agency choice and depending on what we have uh fed the most that's what's going to conquer us and so look let me go back to this young man this young man as the prophet teaches us maybe he left school University his parents taught him good things and when he finished what he was trying to finish he ended up with a lot of money so the Bible that's why the Bible calls him the Rich Young Ruler now when he came face to face with eternal life because Jesus is the eternal life amen Jesus is eternal life because he said I am the way the truth and the life and death can't dwell with eternal life so us we have come face to face with eternal life in our in our walk in our daily life what do we do do do we try we try to live the best that we can but in the air there are powers in the air there are demons everywhere that are trying to to derail you and I day by day either you're even if you're young or if you're older the devil doesn't care about ages the devil doesn't care about that what he cares about is to be able to derail you derail your mind first because Paul said every day we have to renew the spirit of our mind because that's where the devil works in the mind the mind is the womb and when the mind is impregnated it comes down to the heart and from the heart all these bad desires come and depending on what you have desired that's what comes to light blessed be the name of the Lord [Music] amen maybe I went ahead a little bit but I want you to to see this the the the word confront means facing someone or something especially in a challenge in life it's inevitable for you to have to face uh uh uh to come face to face with some things in life we confront our fears so that we don't allow them to dominate us we confront error because ignoring it might do us wrong might do us bad Jesus had several confrontations with those who were coming against him the the apostles and the prophets in the bible they felt that they uh forced to confront themselves being that their message would bother the people is that correct confrontation can be good or can also be bad depending the situation and the Bible gives examples of [Music] this bad confrontation is motivated by pride and and wrong desire or other carnal desires those that confront others in order to to be able to to win some favor for themselves or to seem like they're better than someone else they're abusing that that Arc of Confrontation Street Wars start when a leader of a of a gang a gang leader starts problems with another one social media Wars start when one starts with another one on that on those platforms you know what I'm talking about you're not gaining anything with these confrontations because your motives are are are are are are are just dealing just with you selfish in other words Jesus many times was an object of a confrontation while he was preaching and teaching in Judea the main the the the priests sades and the Pharisees were motivated by pride and and fear and the fact that they didn't know what was going on and the desire to be able to and that's why they felt offended what Jesus would say and do and they would take advantage of any opportunity to confront him and his last confrontation finished was on his crucifixion the greatest crime in history in human history the greatest crime of human history now watch the prophet teaches us he tells us everything that we do that we do wrong when we know better crucifying the Lord Jesus Christ in you we denying eternal life we are denying eternal life and and so as men and women brothers and sisters we have to be very careful because this is like this is like a thread devil wants to cut it and he wants to disconnect us amen amen he wants to disconnect us from that love from that Divine love and that's something that the devil really wants disconnect you from him and once you're disconnected you're running desperately but your thread has been cut and so when you come to desperation I'm going to say it this way many people lose children what can you do you can get desperate you can cry you can you can do whatever you will never get get him back he will never come back now to to cut the communication with God that who is love who cuts that communication the devil our enemy and so how are we are going to confront eternal life because all the things of this life they're wanting to trap us especially social media social media is one of the most dangerous things is allowing it is allowing spiritual death in people so we want to confront or come face to face with eternal life when we can't it's sometimes is there's no remedy for it anymore there's no remedy because you are cut you have no connection so that's why the devil wants Brothers to just fight with another wants to separate us from fellowship and that's what he wants but that's why we are here this morning Servants of the Lord Jesus Christ to to come together eternal life or face to face eternal life because the majority is the greater power the union is great is a greater power amen amen let's read the uh what brother Brandon says the message that God gave us are you happy this morning blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the message come follow me uh paragraph 39 the Holy Spirit through brother Brandon he says here let's look at this fellow for a few minutes that we read about no doubt that this kid was born in a good home why is there no doubt about that because he was young he knew the Commandments he was rich and that was there was no doubt about that how many are rich here how many are millionaires I'm a millionaire Paul said that we we we're we're expensive in the eyes of God Amen we're we're expensive just one one soul that has repented and saved how much is it worth more than 10,000 worlds you you don't even that doesn't even cover half of the United States now do you know more than 10,000 worlds that's that's your worth then this man here was rich in properties his father or he might have have inherited because a young man because maybe he comes to a point where he's paying rent his car insurance and and at the end of the month he's asking for more for some money from his dad for for for gas a young man in our age but this young man he was rich he was he was wealthy but what he didn't have why he didn't know if he had or not if he had eternal life or not now when you know that you have eternal life you're the most happiest person ever you're the most thankful person ever brother bham says that you're waiting for the doors to open so that you can come worship to come worship it's not to just sing good songs to worship is to come here to The Altar and to ask the Lord Lord help Lord bring your children bring your bring bring your your neighbors bring anyone amen predestin children that is a good worshipper not is the one that plays guitar really well are the one that sings like an angel no the good worshipper is the one that worships in every moment and in every place amen are you with me all right let's continue I don't know how much time I have but I'm just I'm just [Laughter] starting I normally preach back home about 35 minutes so you don't worry so this is what we see when Jesus uh uh okay so no doubt that this kid was born in a good home like you kids are he was brought up with good parents because it proved it when Jesus presented to him the Commandments of God he he said I've kept these since youth it showed that he had been he had been brought upright the prophet uses this word he wasn't just a snatch out and you know he had been brought up to know what's right kids like you all are probably come up under a God-fearing Mother and Daddy to teach him right when he was a kid that's why I like you instruct a child in the way that now when when it's talking about a child I believe it's not just a a little newborn when you come to the knowledge of the word you come to this glorious message you are a child you're a child said instruct a child in the way that now in the natural in the natural you could you can do it but the psalmist said instruct the child in the way they should go that when he gets older he shall not depart he might depart he might depart each and every one of us have backslid for in our life each and every one of us there's not one but the life that has been given us that that teaching that has been taught us that won't go away from us and each one of us that have backslid we have to return we have to return amen why why do we have to return because it's part of the plan of God it's part of God's perfect plan that you and I in this day we were predestined in this in this age for what to manifest to be manifested as Sons and Daughters of God that's what Paul said he said we are waiting the manifestation of the sons of God amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord now this young man because of his riches he didn't want to accept eternal life he was before eternal life and he rejected it he had three moral agents he he was going to accept and as he accepted he had to obey what the eternal life was telling him what was the eternal life telling him go sell everything that you have now what do you have what do you have to sell let me tell each and every one of you nothing is free but the Lord Jesus said come and buy without money and without price but you don't buy anything free everything that you've obtained everything that has gotten in your way in life you have to sell it you have to you have to give it back to whoever you bought it from let me tell you this morning brother and sister the devil has not given us anything free the devil never sells you anything for free gives you anything for free now you have to just go ahead and just give it back to him and this is not mine all these wrong desires all these bad actions they're not my own so I I just give them back to you Satan that's what we have to do in order to obtain eternal life because eternal life what is eternal life Prophet teaches us to live for others and what are we going to live the life that the prophet taught us that's what you have to show people that is living for others not that you go to work and you're going to give your money or your paycheck to someone else no but the life that you live that means eternal life blessed be the name of the Lord amen in paragraph 40 um in the same in the same uh quote maybe his mom had great ambition Ambitions for him how many mothers here how many are mothers who have children you as mother s you want the best for your children right you want your children to be the best especially as since we we recognize this message but the devil is so astute that he's come to try to steal that away from us mentally spiritually you might say but but I have my son and does your son want to come to church does your son really want to come to church have you sat down with him or asked your daughter and ask her daughter do you really want to come to church good question I tell you that by experience and it broke my heart so much my oldest son he's an obedient boy but he's not going to church he told me he said Dad I want to have my own experience I want to feel it for myself and that broke my heart so much he said dad he said I don't want you to come knock the door and tell me let's go to church don't come knocking my door like that anymore how do you think I felt when he told me that now us being parents that the lord lord Jesus said you are good parents you've given everything to your children you're not going to give them a stone instead of bread you're not going to give them a snake instead of a fish that's right you're going to give them the best and how much our heavenly father that he loves us and so what you love and what you tell the say those things how do you think you feel so our heavenly father how do you think he feels when you tell him those things when one of his children when one of his children has rejected his word how do you think he feels now do we really need an experience yeah we need it either whether you're young and your experience that you and I should have Prophet said the new birth we the new new birth and so when you have the new birth your nature changes as your nature changes God comes in and he takes control he takes control and he's the one that guides us he's the one that teaches us of what we need to do and during as as a father you bring your child to church at 10 years old eight years old Come On Son let's go to church and because they want to obey let's go but really do they really want to come let's ask ourselves as parents do our children really if they haven't really had that experience in their life and if you haven't experienced that in your life do it ask them that before the devil takes them it's hard you know you just look at the prophet's life how he felt how did Brother brandham feel him being the servant of God can you imagine that all eyes were on him were on the servant of the Lord eyes were on the pastor all eyes on the Deacon all eyes on the on on on the uh uh on the uhu a leader at church and what can you do the life that you live is not the life that your son's living because it's an individual walk what you say is what your children are going to do when the Lord deals W with your heart or with their heart because the the steps of a good man are ordered by who are ordered by God blessed be the name of the Lord I'm I don't think I'm going to finish but I think we have two Services right okay all right Lord Jesus allow we may continue this afternoon and in in paragraph 41 continuing to read here in the same message and so the mother and father with him praying constantly so that your so that their son would not be just a common boy but an extraordinary young man that is why every parent would want did you hear Jesus as he referred to that commandment honor your father and mother and so he he stood there and that is the ambition of any father to do the best he can for his children to educate [Music] them to maybe even give them the things that they have themselves had and that's how I feel with my children sometimes I think about going to school and I sent Becky and I sent Sarah and Joseph to these to these schools and all these places where all these bad behaviors are I would rather just take them up in a mountain somewhere and raise them up there with the Indians but this is the thing this is the thing watch what the prophet says here what is in the in the in the child is going to come out doesn't matter where he is that has that is going to come out if there's wickedness there that's what's going to come out and even in the Indian Camp if I took him to the Indian Camp if he's going to be up there that same wickedness will come out in no matter what camp he's at so so you see now watch social media I have heard men older men they have rejected this message why why have you ever asked yourself why when a person has walked in this glorious message 40 years how many years did Moses walk in the desert how many and the prophet says how how much time that they have to get to the promised land in reality just a short time that's how we are now we think we're 40 years into this and we're just the best of the best you know what when you start thinking like that you're the most miserable one and I am too that's why the Apostle Paul was careful and saying renewing of our mind the renewing of our mind the spirit of our mind when we have that kind of wisdom because you have to have a wisdom how to renew that mind how how do we renew how do we restore renew a vehicle a car when we we see that it's old when we see that maybe it's not running anymore the devil likes to make you look like junk in your mind that's why we need God in our life in order to Reen in order to restore our mind our spirit when you have those tools available you're you're you're good to go you're good to go but you need we need this message we need this message this message is to what to restore that's why God sent this message and what was he going to restore it it was going to restore something that was already kind of a junky amen you're a child of God you're a daughter of God while you're facing eternal life face to face on a daily basis Jesus told this young man go sell everything that you have to the poor and then come and follow me every week no he said daily come follow me daily daily and to serve God daily is to live a life that is worth but is worth more than 10,000 worlds and when the people say you look good look at that nice hair you have are you walking are you preaching are you preaching and you man wavered man look how good you look look how how how life has changed you he's preaching he's preaching what is he preaching what he lives is what the prophet said he said Don't Preach me a sermon he live me a Ser that's [Applause] it okay give me one more minute and let me just read you this last one stand to your feet have the musicians come and the prophet continues here asking this question do you know something 86 % of conversions to Jesus Christ happened before the 20 21 years old that's what it shows that's what statistics show that's what the the statistics show and 86% of those that come to Christ come before they're 21 once you're at you're past that age you're more molded or hardened in your ways oh but it's possible sure whether it's 70 or or when they come to 70 or 80 years old they come in but sometimes it's it's it's not it's strange for that to happen that's right am now if the Lord
