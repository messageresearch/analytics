surprised we're not going to use Ephesians we'll get back to that first John 2. and uh just remember to pray for our wife she had a lot of trouble yesterday and last night with her her back hurting her a lot and it's you know she went to the doctor and got the shots and things and it helped on that part but then Satan just moved it up about 10 or 15 inches above the iron and started hurting

for that we don't have to pay anything for it don't have to do anything to get it we just have to relax and receive father we ask you this day to do that for us as we try to speak about you that Lord

this morning and all Lord with her back hurting her just just touch her father and let everything be well because we believe your word and we thank you have your way Beaver brother coffee there ever what the problem will be and take it away from him and all these other requests that have come in we just ask you to manifest yourself and and let it be known that you are God through healings and signs and wonders Among Us guide us now forgive our sins and lead us Lord as we read your words you come and speak to us about your work in Jesus name amen first John 2. now this will be a background far to be able to finish Wednesday night I didn't finish the message you know that we kind of just went through a preview and review but I didn't finish up what I wanted to because I knew it wouldn't have enough time and and the Lord's just began to reveal it to me so you know this will be now a background so remember that this will be a background up to so far in the message and then I'll tell you where that we change over okay and that way we'll you'll see how it all ties together but first John 2 will begin in verse 18. little children I think that's who we are you know he speaks to the fathers he speaks to the to the grown-up ones and then to the children in the Book of John and I think we're just a little children and that's serious I mean that little children it is the last time and as you have heard that Antichrist shall come even now are there are many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us see what's he saying they went out from us because it wouldn't of us you know what when we left the Baptist they said they went out of us because it wouldn't of us you know that was true you know when you left the Presbyterian you went out from them because you wouldn't of them right you may have been over them for a while but not to stay with them or would have stayed there or someone so now we're just manifesting what we are if I'm getting there but you have an auction from the Holy One and you know all things I have not written unto you because you know not the truth but because you know it and that no lie is of the truth who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ he is Antichrist that denied the father and the son see then we're not Oneness all right the next verse we're not Trinity either we know the truth right because that's what he's just got to say and you know the truth I write to you because you know the truth see all right so we're going to look at what he said who is it who isn't alive but he that denied that Jesus is the Christ he is Antichrist that denies the father and the son right whosoever denied the son hath not the the son the same hath not the father but he that acknowledges the son hath the father also let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you now remember remain in you now that'll be more this afternoon's message you should you also shall continue in the Sun and in the father and this is the promise that he had promised us even eternal life these things I have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and you need not that any man teach you but it's the same anointing teaches you of all things and is truth and there's no lie and even as it hath taught you you shall abide in him you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word thank you now we haven't got off of the adoption um we're just breaking down to speak about it because we studied on adoption and brought it in three stages you know the new birth and then bringing it up to the Authority or the you know the uh point of hearing him The Headstone coming on the individual and adopting them into the family and then at that time is to sweep out as the prophet said a message that would you know from the uniting of the head and body and it's not another message or another Prophet to come you know and stuff like that we're not looking at something like that it is the message of the hour that we're looking at so don't misunderstand that all right but because I wasn't the one that said that that it would sweep out and that there'd be a message it was our Prophet that said that but see we're not trying to concern ourselves then with the change in the basis of the moment the twinkling of an eye because that's what everybody talks about change change Rapture change change all right but see to me if we're not in the right place in the right position as I've always said you don't go down to the bus depot to get you an airplane ticket you know that's just not even sensible you know you you go to the airport and then at that place you don't go to the wrong terminal because they list each one you know you've got to you've got America you got the you know all of these others that are sitting there Pan Am and all and and doctor you've got to go to the right place you got to be in the right place and the prophet of God said to be in the wrong ranks at the Rapture would be no excuse that's right now I didn't say that he said it that's right so all I'm trying to do is to get me and you to find the right plane ticket okay if it's Delta and I don't like Delta well the only time my flute dealt to the Jamaica I lost my luggage and I had to wear brother Brady stuff and use sister Brady's uh cologne you know and the old Rooks and stuff and uh brother Brady chased me all day but anyhow but that was just you know and it wasn't their fault I know because it has so much I'm just saying that but uh see let's make sure we line up at the right place and be ready because that's all we're supposed to be concerned with and as I say now it is not that no more than about years ago I told that I'm not talking about or interested in the uh the going to heaven amen I said because I've always thought and believed that heaven was supposed to come here to get me to take me there right well if I go there I'm in the wrong place see because he's here all right see now that's not meaning you're not wanting the Lord to come it means an understanding you know of where we're at and what we're doing so we got into the adoption and the adoption is the third stage of adoption is not the change right it is to understand the change I hope by now that that is dwelling within our hearts and where it says in Romans 8 30 verse 23 to it to understand the Redemption of the body see so then that's what we're trying to do is to get him to understand that right and I believe that's what we're dealing with now is the understanding of that and we've been dealing with it ever since we started right see because it's not a new thing it's not something different it's like I told you when God gave you the new birth he said he is pleased to dwell in your soul all right and in that new birth that he gave you he laid claim on that body and says you're not going to get another one all right so it's working on this one that we're doing and you know and he's been gracious to us all these years and giving us 40 something years to be able to preach to try to get us to the position that we can find the right airplane tickets no the airline to get in line and have everything right but now so we're not leaving that we're on the third stage of it which is to wit the understanding of the Redemption of the body in other words learning it right and we must first learn it by even in the mechanics you know you know what I'm talking about the prophet we speak of mechanics and Dynamics and mechanics is the word and the word of God must be sown down in our hearts that's right and that's what I'm saying that we've got to be at the right place if we don't know where to be how do we know what to do all right so we've been told all these years and and we're getting into a position to know where to stay what stay with the word amen let's stay with the word amen because it's the one that's going to lead us through all right amen now what's the point now of what we're going to try to cover today because according to what we read in the Bible it looks odd doesn't it he's just got through explaining to the people that's when we went back to verse 18 we should have read back to verse one and come over you read that sometime and try it all together but he tells you that you have little children you have the new birth you have an unction of the or about verse uh 20. which means like dynamite it's like a a you know uh an anointing all right right and uh you have that and we know he said verse 22 that we know the truth all right now so then don't let nobody deceive you he said because you know these things right all right see then after all of that saying it looks like he makes an odd statement in verse 27 because he's talking about the anointing that he's just talked about all right and then he says you don't need nobody to teach you well see that's what a lot of people in the message today they believe it that way and a lot of people in the world believe it anyway we don't need nobody to teach us we have the Holy Ghost well according to the prophet of God he said if we have the Holy Ghost it'll lead us to the word all right amen no if we're not led to the word we don't have the Holy Ghost that's not sexual that's not a that's don't take a big brainstorm to understand that's just plain language all right but see then I gave you the quote because we know what it says the Wildwood then the prophet said you know why would it be that we would God would write in his scripture that we need to fight for ministry right see and then you turn around you say well brother Dale I just stay at home listen to tapes I just do this I want it right straight from brother Brandon well according to the Bible you won't get it I know that that's the Bible responsible for other than telling you what it says you mean I can't get it without a thoughtfulness according to the Bible now I mean to settle it you know you say well brother Dale you shouldn't be that I'm not arrogant I'm just telling the truth seeing you say well we need no man teacher well then shut your tape recorder down and don't listen to brother Branham because that's a man teaching you that's right all right come on see we think that we're so smart in our doings and then we trap ourselves oh yes I stay with the prophet well that's a man teaching you right and no man can reveal anything to you we'll get to that this afternoon more that's right if he did what you need to hold it goes far then right they got to work together that's what I want you to see today that's my point of the whole message is to see how the Holy Spirit works with that that anointing of the Holy Spirit through somebody else will work in you amen it's on the inside of you and it'll come together what's inside of you comes together with what you hear right all right see then we have it in perfect order that's the whole text of what I'm trying to get so if you miss it that's my whole point see but see you say well we don't need nobody to teach us right all right then brother round and what did he say about it unless you Egypt in Israel and Egypt paragraph 104. he says well you say I don't need anybody to teach me glory to God I got the Holy Ghost well then the Holy Ghost was wrong when it said it set some in the church teachers God put them in the church as teachers that settles it mine he put teachers in there if the Holy Ghost is going to do all the teaching huh all right so now we say we believe brother Branham all right then you gotta say Amen to what he said and wrote me you know and I'm honest sometimes I've had to say on me you know it cuts you you know your work does and and but it's not for a reason all right amen but see then why would he put the prophet would say like Ephesians 4 see we read in John we say we got the word well what about Ephesians 4 11. then he gave some Apostles some Prophet some evangelist pastor of teacher going on down through there to say for what for the perfecting of the Saints right and the prophet of God verifying right that they would have to be a Firefall Ministry to break this message down to the people on the Statue of perfect man he should fill me up Lord that I may teach others Apostle prophets painless pastor and teacher for the bringing of these things into the church all right sure that doesn't make anything that didn't give me a raise right you know I didn't get a raise because I said God's word I just believe God's word I believed it before I was a preacher or a pastor and I believe it now amen because that's the one thing that I believe I believe in Reading What God Says and believing it right then when if we're going to believe brother Branham brought us what God Said then we'll have to believe that he didn't bring us something contrary I'll get to it this evening all he's done was open our understanding right because he couldn't Quicken it unto us the Holy Ghost would have to be the one so when I watched this message this morning tie in now back to Wednesday night and then we'll get back and speak a little bit this afternoon on it all right but see the main thing I want you to look at is you've got to have the inside teacher right that's right all right and the Holy Ghost is not an outside teacher I said well now you're going this way then you're going that way well you show me which way to go I mean I'll turn the pulpit over you and I'll give you the notes and let you speak about this and tell you what we're talking about we're talking about the Holy Ghost being the inside teacher all right but that inside teacher that's inside of you buy the new birth the anointing right all right and I gave you a quote down here where right around said that that was where it come when it come down on Jesus it came down and went inning right okay because it's an inside teacher all right now so I gave you the quote that paragraph one or page 143 of the Samaritan Church age that it's not an outside teacher it's an inside teacher he said you could hear the word read it there's I'm talking you could hear the word every day of your life and put the wrong interpretation on it without having the inside teacher all right so then we must have the inside teacher all right now here's where the preacher comes in if he don't have the inside teacher how can he teach you absolutely amen he'll teach you his own idea all right he'll teach you his own thought his own Doctrine see so then the holy spirit's working on both ends right the holy spirit is supposed to be in me to get a message that I can speak to you that the holy spirit inside of you will say amen back to it now of course a lot of you don't amen but then that makes you say well brother Dale tell me what some of your people believe I don't know because they don't amen what I say so I don't know what and a lot of times they'll amen what other people are saying but that's all right that's your business I just don't worry about it I just preach the gospel you can do what you want to you know about the rest of it you can vote me out anytime you want to and get you another Pastor if you think somebody else can help us and then I'll sit down and say Amen to it because I'm I want to get out of here not not just playing around I want to get out of here all right and see you don't have to amen me for me to preach I was going to preach what I'm going to pray for you amen or not it's just you know it just helps you right you know it does have to keep you awake right amen amen I already amen and many a time because when somebody was saying something you know what was work on my eyeballs were doing dropping in that realize if I wake up and holler amen I'm gonna I'm not gonna go to sleep so maybe it'll help you to stay away all right but now listen amen amen get the point God uses someone to teach us right right but he cannot reveal it okay that's right right he can only teach it right all right she because the holy spirit's got to be inside to be able to make it alive and run around and said that Holy Spirit is down in your soul waiting on you to bring him the word he said and when he bring you bring it in pure in other words he said this immediately made a lot now if it's brought in not pure right he can't make it loud he's going to say he's going to say nope it's not right amen agree amen if he's in her so then why should we worry about it well I don't want to listen to brother so and so I might get deceived no you're all ready to see I mean we're just born to see why don't we admit that's right we going that away and until God takes us totally and changes us all the way through amen we still have a deception within us that's right that's correct it's called a human being right of what we are all right let's see he chose the foolishness of preaching what about that right First Corinthians 1 21. all right I'll give you a couple quotes from running around them there on it question answers on the Holy Ghost in 59 and in the world and is falling apart in 63 where he said through the foolishness of preaching right it would say it in the loss that's right see then that way we have to depend upon the one that is inside of us to lead us now right and then by doing that then we must follow what is brought unto us that's right amen all right and that Holy Spirit within us will tell us whether or not the preacher is right that's right so why do we worry about being confused right right I could sit down and listen to the to the pope of Rome explaining the Catholic Church to the detail that wasn't deceive me come on brother you know I listened to a man eight hours one day explain the Mormon Doctrine when you finish you know what I said I said you wouldn't believe it but most of the people I follow around in myself believe what you believe they just call it the message the two souls coming down from the the Mormon doctrine of pre-existence get my point see we need the teacher or the faithful Ministry now see it just says teacher a lot of people just you know that they take one word now I believe we need to fight for an industry all right amen amen I believe we need to go over five four minutes not just one Ministry there's no such thing I don't have it all right it doesn't know what it won't work in one individual because a random had it all right but he sat down and listened to the five four minutes okay so then he showed what we need to do all right but we need to file for Ministry to speak to us the word of the Lord that God has made alive to them right that's it all right now at Earth where we'll get to this evening you'll see more about it you know how can they preach without Maybe all right because that way God cannot Quicken anything that has error in it right that's right that's right and you show me that again there's just no way you can't Quicken it because when he told me years ago he said you preach the gospel I'll back it up and I thought my Lord I'm preaching and would challenge the world of this message come show me what's wrong but I knew later on what he's saying stay with it just keep on going all right just keep going right on down the road no matter what everybody else does just go right on down the road preaching the gospel because it's foolishness but around you know what is to say he said now to God the world is foolishness he said but to the world God's word is foolishness because they don't believe it all right and see then through the foolishness of preaching and then you listen to the Lord Jesus you're listening to a man what we're saying falls apart right but yeah that's not going to change anybody because you know what they're gonna go right on believing what to believe they're gonna go right on listening to whatever and play it takes and that that's all right right you know that's that's their business that's nothing to me and you that's no concern it's just an explanation of telling you what I'm talking about right now I want to speak more this afternoon on the point of how the fifo ministry is involved in your salvation and but now we want to take a point to try to get it for this morning all right see my point I want you to see is as the faithful Ministry is teaching us the word see we must have that inside teacher okay because if we don't we have nothing to Quicken it unto us you know to make it alive to us and and we can't get what's being said all right so now we know that the anointing is the holy spirit right right and it dwells within you that's right the auction is within you all right now then we know that it's using others to speak to us it can even use people to speak that are not Christians yes that's correct amen you know not born again bride right I told you about the man that preached all you do in word indeed do all in the name of Jesus Christ and everybody else start praying in Jesus Christ and I said brother mode I'm ready to go to the water because I was in the Baptist Church I had to go get that straight because I seen I had to get baptized in the Lord Jesus Christ see and God used that man and I hope he gives you eternal life for that one makes you deep right you know I do I want everybody to be there right amen but now listen see that anointing is to be the inside teacher that we must have to teach us the word now father what I'm saying for just a second because if it's not the inside teacher we will agree and the biggest Fortune religious world does this agrees with the Bible being right I mean you go to the Baptist church today and you hold up a Bible said holy Bible they said we believe every word is sitting there well you know to a degree they do but then you start telling them the things that are in there about one God the water baptism and they'll go along with the one God two you hit the water Baptist right right then they'll rebel against you all right why because they've been taught all of their life of the Trinity exactly right they sung songs since they were well you know don't condemn them just remember where you and I came from because we sung the same songs and we had the same thoughts right right amen we'll see we need the inside teacher to keep us straight right because now here's what I want you to see if you don't have the inside teacher then you'll take what man says become religious Etc go to church be a church member field abuse whatever do it right you know and the whole world will preach in heaven when you die right that's right right but see that don't have anything to do with it that you say well you don't want us to live right now I want you to get saved amen you get saved and you live right that's a simple answer to anything you know you don't want me to do this no no I want you to get bored again I'm not telling you to go out and live like the devil I'm just telling you you are that's right it's like problem solved we are the devil until we get born again what are we all right well then I get what we're talking about we know the message because this is what's hard was hard seemingly to a lot of us to understand but you know you could be anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit every day of your life and still be lost now you think it nominational world you think you can explain that to Pentecostal people that that's all they are is that upward geared gumption you know I feel it I still love to steal it and I'm going to say this about three times this morning Please don't panic that brother Dale is saying that there's not an anointing that comes down now you'll hear me the statements I'll be making in Reading will sound like that but please don't do it now because that's not what I'm saying because I believe in the prayer feelings of the Lord I believe in the presence of the Lord I've seen things I've told you about it so then don't misunderstand me all right let's see what is the good of all of that if we're not born again right amen right what is the good of all that we see all the presence of the Lord right over calling he said that's the blessings amen amen now who wouldn't want the presence of the Lord I know offended people that you remember some of them are talking about the peruzia or parsia the way they said you pronounce it and they said it's the presence of the Lord I said well according to the Bible it's Peruzzi is used for Pharisee is used for Antichrist as well as used for Jesus Christ I said it simply means standing beside of you I said I don't want the Lord standing beside me amen I want him with me everywhere I go I didn't understand what I'm saying right if he's standing over beside him and I didn't mean he's gonna have to kill me one day amen if he's standing right not in here he's not destroyed me but I want to talk about anointed ones right or the anoint King right would be the better part of the title right now we know the message yes and we're supposed to understand right all right that the prophet caught these things and says you can be anointed as a sin with the genuine Holy Spirit right amen it was hard for him to understand the Lord had to speak to him and show him right right right all right because that would be a hard thing to do is to try to understand how that could be done but he would use people like uh haphas you know we'll see the one one of them said you know that it's necessary that one died for the sins of the people one the high priest said that I believe it was confident well see that was Brethren said that was the anointing of the Holy Spirit speaking the word and that's why to me that that when John came and said who you see the Holy Ghost descending and remaining you remember John the Baptist who you see the Holy Ghost and remaining amen the Bible emphasizes why because you can go seek accomplished get up from the congregation under the high priest anointing and just prophesy oh yeah sure and surely he'd heard of Balaam yeah I'll let Balaam could say the thing you know they want balance since it's written in the Bible all right yep all right see but that anointing he can be upon you amen that's right and if you're not born again right what are you I gave you the quote so you read the quote um he said genuine anointing trying to do quite a service on his will the Christ revealed in his own word number nine on your note sir he said out here in the spirit realm you can be anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit right and the anointed ones right oh if I could just feel his presence oh if I could just feel the Lord know if I could have the lord inside of me right then I don't worry about the feelings because I know they're going to come right right amen anointed ones have to work upon the basis of gifts and and things and bring in the presence of God and singing him down and worshiping down our fasting or praying or doing and brother rather said they can even cast out Devils heal the sick all right you just be anointed on your spirit he said in their soul they're lost right now that's hard to slaughter sometimes that's correct amen amen right that's right so we got to believe it see so now is that anointing just anointing you or is it inside of you come on bro amen come on see what I said when I say these things like that see then you'll think that I'm saying that there is not something coming down no sir now don't get that I've seen God I've seen Angels I've smelt the presence of the Lord you know oh my testimony of all these years so don't think nothing like that about me that I don't believe in the presence I'll tell you sometimes they come on up here the presence of the Lord is here right that's right all right so I believe in the presence of the Lord and I want the presence of the Lord and I wish he would walk with me I used to when I was my brother first started talking to me about the message and I was lost as far as I was a denominational believer but I didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost when I feel his presence so close to me until and I'd be walking up the driveway at the house after getting out of the car talking with brother mold about the message and and I I knew he was tired and I'd look around but try to find him because it was somebody with me you know I believe in that in that so don't mention misunderstatements will make may sound like that I'm just doing no I just gotta have it inside I'd have it inside God had been said I ain't saying that so now you go tell somebody that's the way brother Dale believes that you're a liar and you'll face God is dead okay nice point but it's true but see I believe on the inside of you the Holy Spirit and I've explained it to you so I'll go through it again what's the difference in anointed ones anointed on their spirit and a genuine Christian what's the difference you have if you are a Christian you are born again Christian and you've been a Christian I don't care how long 10 years two seconds or 40 years do you know it's your anointed just exactly like anointed ones that's right that's what people don't understand see they don't want to go that way the anointing comes on your spirit right all right on your spirit Realm and the same anointing is upon you as a Christian as the anointing this upon I am are the others whatever anybody you would say is Fault what's the difference because what happened was that's why I did I believe it like I do that the new birth is a birth of the word those disciples took the Bible said they took the word and held it right and when the Holy Ghost fell it quickened what word they had inside of them it didn't Quicken the seals and the Thunders and the plagues and the vows amen it didn't Quicken that to him back there right it quickened what they heard it and made that alive so that Holy Spirit comes down that anointing upon your spirit and when it does if there's something in there for it to quickly Make That Word Alive in you then inside of you is not just an anointing but the anointed is inside of you and I remember I said this in the background if I get through now I'll finish you to see this is a background for what I left off Wednesday night okay that anointing see can be upon your spirit and you still be lost that's right amen so it's important to hear the word right and the disciples took the word and held it the Bible said it emphasize what they've done with it right how about Peter said where can we go thou Hast the words of eternal life what can we do all right so that anointing can come down and anoint you and you do great signs and wonders and still lost right but if you've heard the truth the word the truth then God when the Holy Spirit drops down as the anointing that Holy Spirit can drop right on into the soul as the person of Jesus Christ that's the difference between a person that's not born again and what it is one that's born again as the person of Jesus Christ which is not just the anoint King and it is the anointed himself right amen it is to God himself it is a very anointed right that drops within your soul amen amen and makes alive that word and urging your birth amen right you follow me with that amen coach if you follow me I want to go a little further and let you see but you would say then with brother Dale why would God allow these things to take place like that why would he allow the anointed ones to be there why would he allow all of these things to happen you know where I'm going go to Deuteronomy now let's read what the Bible says about it Deuteronomy 13. let's read what the Bible says of why God will allow anointed ones to be here in the last days especially because we've been down through time all the way down through from the time the Holy Ghost fell that's what John was explaining the Antichrist was already there three told that it was backed by our anointed ones with back there just like you know you know but uh listen all right go to Deuteronomy 13. verse 1. if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and give it the a sign or a Wonder now listen now see we're always based upon the bases that if a prophet give you a sign and wonder you're supposed to believe it all right that's wonderful that's right that's true watch the rest of the story though and the shine are the Wonder come to pass whereof he spake unto thee saying listen let us go after other gods that's it and watch which thou has not known and let us serve them now a sign is Wonder come to Pius he tells you what's going to take place 30 people Landing caskets they're all going to race in the Dead all right all right Gloria Hallelujah we got to follow that but what if he's taking you to another God you don't want to know the God is another God is another form of the word or what you've taken of your own two Souls seven Thunder versus son of man River Jordan how many more can we name but if one after another God right one because they went after another Doctrine a word you said well you shouldn't talk about them I'm not talking about nobody I'm talking about Doctrine right all right but look what he says Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that Prophet right or that dreamer of dreams for the Lord your God proveth you to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul amen and he does it to prove you right he's going to prove you you're going to try you I want to go over that verse chapter 18 while we had it let's read another one let's see what it's 18 20. but the prophet which shall presume oh let's go to verse 19 to seal in what I was saying because he's talking about a prophet verse 18. I'll raise up the prophet among you among the Brethren like unto thee and thou will put and I will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words listen which he shall speak in my name I will require it of them so if a prophet says something you've got to believe it if it comes to pass amen balaam's prophecy was perfect is Doctrine wrong right right yep all right so watch now but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which I have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that Prophet shall die at once and if thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken he'll give you a shine and come to pass he said how are we going to know the word in other words how we're going to know whether prophet's right or not right how do you know where brother randoms right or not there's people that says he said this and it ain't come to pass that people said he said this and they come to fight if people said that he was hunting at the wrong date out in Arizona that the cloud appeared February the 28th which is correct and brother Randall wasn't out there until March the 8th and that's correct they can prove it it's correct right it's easy I might run a dick though I'll put it in my word this Prophet has brought me an understanding of opening it at least naturally to the Natural letter of the word being correct amen and right right and no matter what man says about him I'm not concerned condemned him remember for killing game for other people he promised the Lord but we better read all the promise he said Lord I won't kill no game for nobody else unless it's an emergency right yeah read it unless there was some reason that was needful he would kill the game yep amen because I go out and like I told in the door but one time he said we're getting laid off what are you going to do if we run out of money I said I got a milk bucket and I said my neighbor's got chickens unless I got a garden my garden runs out my neighbor's chickens runs out I said I'll go milk my neighbor's cow so we got to live and that's above the laws of God on the you know the natural lamb things up here all right but listen and if thou saying thine heart how shall we know the word which the Lord has not spoken Now read the next verse when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if the thing fall or not now he's breaking it down nor come to pass that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken but the prophet has spoken it presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid of him right but what's the point that's right God allows anointed ones to test you enough amen I gave you a couple of quotes after this the word brother random is covering that God tests you he'll make you sick he said he said put you in the hospital he make you sick he makes all kind of things happen to Christians the Lord does that he's got to permit it Satan can't get on me what do you think kept me well all these years God didn't let Satan get on me put on me what he did on other people all right sure I'm a first to admit that amen because I believe yeah I believe like brother John Martin said why can't we pray in years we met years ago he said why not pray before to keep it away instead of waiting till we get it and then pray for it praise God take care of you don't do the right thing you see God does things to test you and I am about to see whether or not we're going to stay with the word amen allow someone to come and give you a sign what would happen right today come on now you'll be just as honest you can be of course I try to be what would happen to 90 of the people this message if some man appeared on the scene and I'm going to quote you it's already to happen so hold on the signs and wonders would follow the person what's 90 of the people this Macy's gonna do probably 99. they're going to run after it like crazy there was a man right after brother Branham passed away now I'm quoting from what a man said and I've got where I'm trying to keep from saying names because you know but I can't call the name but they went to this man after Brett around him and shortly after he passed away and they went a big name in the message and sat down to listen to him because he had signs and wonders following him and they could not argue with him about what was taking place now that happened somewhere about 1966. don't you think Satan will try his best to impersonate everything what if somebody walked in here today and looked like brother random come in I'm not picking on nothing I'm telling you like it is how are you going to check what anybody does I'm going to take brother Brown's message and I'm going to sit down and listen to it when we're through I'm going to say brother what about this if he can't take what wrote around and said here and put it in what he's saying then I'm going to tell him to his face he's false you're not going to worry about it because that's what they've done in the days of power I'll be glad to see today to come to do it why because we got the message to check in other words if somebody come along you know what run around and talk hell's not Eternal well then somebody come along now and some big something happened somebody looked even like him somebody that would have mannerism like him or somebody preached like him and signs and wonders take place and he said when I come here to tell you brother round was wrong about that because hell is eternal something's wrong with your inside teacher if you don't get up and say you are false you mean you do it if I don't do it you make me do it I done told you that a man comes here and challenges us if I won't stand here and accept this challenge in him off the word you get me up and you throw me up here where he's at right I believe that mean it I've done stood too long for what this message is right for somebody to come along with some little 65 something to change it right all right that's why I'm so hard against all these doctrinal issues that come out because they're taking you to another God that's right they're leading you away from that and the inside teacher is what it's supposed to teach us amen we were sitting up in a certain place and a whole row of us we're sitting there I won't call the place into the names but we're sitting there and there's a whole row of Believers from here and brother Richard Wilson them was sitting there that's right and everybody in the building was up and down and enjoying and jumping and going all except one row that's right we didn't move a muscle we didn't make a scene I guess we was a scene but we didn't mean to be you know we just sat there because I wasn't going to jump up with the rest of them and holler amen but I didn't agree with a man sure did amen why we've got the Bible the prophet never come to change the Bible you come to tell us what it said he said well what do you mean tell us what it said he come to tell us and didn't teach Joe Kennedy right right but we said it did he didn't change the Bible if I was said that just one true and living God Church through the foolishness of preaching wow through the foolishness of preaching all right and what did he do the foolishness of preaching God's going to save people I didn't put that in the Bible I didn't make myself a preacher amen that's right God did we have to say in mama called Betty sin or Daddy called and Mama sin or something like that you know and that's what a lot of people do and you know what most people I won't cover that this evening so you don't come back that'd be all right I want to talk a little bit about of this anointing in a way like this you know that most people think that preaching the gospel is because they can get your attention and make you get involved with what they're doing brother dick you might as I quote something from you we were sitting in a ministers meeting years ago won't call no names or no do it we were sitting there in a ministers meeting brother dick was very young at that time and he picked up some his brother he got up they announced him and they introduced him and he was up there and boy he was dressed to achieve everything was wonderful you know and I I'm wrong we always say whether Richard Marlow's best dressed person in Luba that's not enough against it we'll do that but I mean he had everything he had to do what he had the Charisma he had everything huh and he started talking and he said now now brother Anderson you get scripture so Acts 2 38 you get that one now now now brother Danny you get this one and you get this one and you get that one and that's not nothing wrong with it no but you know what that is that's an involvement involvement how you say the word getting you involved right see look back there and I see brother Carly asleep and I said brother Carly stand up and read thank you everybody thinks that's preaching the Antichrist you'll see it there it is in John 6 666. never mind seen that I think they had to cross just go to 666. that's what really I don't say about that brother topped all them things and only went out look 666. he said man there's something so we stopped to get some gas and everything that all came up we stopped to get some gas and I was putting in gas and I didn't look I turned around brother house said put another penny in put some more guys then why when a black cat crosses I try to keep running over the cat right you want everybody thinks I ain't fitting right over the damn cat I ain't got no bad problems now you know okay just getting a point all right let me review just a second then see we believe in anointing we believe in the presence of God brother Brown would call it and I really don't know what it means I'm honest I never have been able to find out what he called it the August presence yeah in some sectors of the country August is good this section of the country always said hot now I don't know what it means maybe some of you do because there's a lot of things I don't know Aaron asked me a question when he first come down this way and I couldn't answer it and he said brother Dale couldn't answer that question well we don't need me telling him I could I didn't know that but listen I believe in the presence of God Amen oh what a wonderful feeling yeah I told you about sitting on that deer stand one day boy I was so man and I mean down in the middle of thousands of Acres of government land I was mad at horny I said ain't no deer around here nowhere and the Lord I asked you to give away the deer where I could talk to him and you ain't done it yet and here I am and about that time the prettiest perfume you've ever smelled in your life come down through them Woods and I said now some crazy female is up there in the woods popping her puddle you know it's brand new look there's stuff over with a perfume I've got damn went down on the ground sat down there crying and arguing and fussing Matt is a hornet I guess I said my Lord I get up walk back up to where we's camp here comes the truck what a great big old deer walk out look at us and Donald glad you got one he said I didn't get it that's my brother-in-law he's he got it see God was fulfilling his promise to me well I was argue and fussion about it and smelling his presence it's in the Bible read your Bible I've never done that well maybe you ain't prayed enough maybe you ain't never got through enough but I believe in the presence of God an anointed and I believe that anointing must be an inside teacher but the baptism of the Holy Ghost he comes and lives within us like I've told you being in God's mind before the world is wonderful everybody wants to quote that I was in God I don't want to be in God's mind before the world I want to be part of God's mind I can be in his mind to be lost and die and go to hell because everybody needs mine but if I'm part of his mind let the mind that was in Christ being used you make you a new creature you see so that inside teacher uses the fivefold ministry to speak that's right that's got to have the same anointing to bring it so if they don't they'll bring their own ideas now what would we say in Wednesday and I'll close it we're bringing it down and got down to the time of Solomon and I gave it back to you of the dedication message that sorry with you these are on the internet people can pull them up and read them where brother random is covering how that what happened when Solomon got the temple bill and when the temple was built he said run around says with nothing but furniture sit first an empty building clean washed everything was perfect right he said then there's just Furniture put in he said just furniture I made a statement and I don't know where most of you noticed what I said I made a statement and right after the statement I said you think you've got me if you go back to listen to the message you'll hear me I said you think you've got me but you don't see I told that the two tables of stone where brother Branham said the two tables of stone was The Headstone right that come into the temple that's what he called it the capping stones The Ten Commandments that was the two tables of stone that was in the Ark of the Covenant now Moses later in outer Pockets put the five books right into that huh okay right now that word brother REM called it the hitch time but now brother rounds not talking about dead letter word or letters on a page being a headstone it's a live word amen amen that's why I wrote around him on it's the unveiling God he talks about the ten commandments and calls it to seals right when those seals broke to the prophet they were the Ten Commandments because blood around said they didn't get what they thought when they got the Ten Commandments he said they got God in letter form they thought it was a book of rules I shall not and I shall not they got God in letter form all said the word is spiritual but I'm carnal in other words my understanding of the word is carnal until God quickens that word to me amen and once this quickness Made Alive then it's God and I made the statement I said even though those two tables of stone in the ark came in it was still furniture and then we talked about how that when it was all finished in the Shekinah Glory the prophet said come and fill the room and they couldn't minister I was questioned a little bit after the service about it and I made a statement to the person and I said well you notice I said that you think you got me I said that's not true see it would have took so long to I had to preach this message to be able to explain it so there was no way to do it Wednesday all right now listen I know the Bible I don't mean that I know everything about it get off of that I mean I know the Bible what I looked it up okay that means I looked it up everybody said I know the Bible that means they know no I can't even quote John 3 16. that's it I ain't lying do you you tell me this is the quote to you the Lord's Prayer and I probably wouldn't get it correct because I never tried to memorize the Bible I tried to read the Bible to see what it's saying to me right Joy of it with the prophet's message read it to see what it says do you don't try to memorize it you're tying up your brain and memory you need your brain for the Holy Spirit to do it and I've noticed in life not a look at her today but we need our brain baptized I said Glory need our brains baptizing that's what we need but now listen when those two tables of stone came in that Temple I want to ask you a simple question the anointing failed right the Shekinah Glory King filled a room that they couldn't Minister the Bible do we need to read it do you read around and need to read it there in a second chronicles five is a little better than Kings is actually explained but it filled the temple all right now where did that anointing come from what do you mean brother they only just come down out of the sky did it come down out of the sky or did they come out of that Arc with a cubed that's all I want to know sure did he come out of that Ark of the Covenant or did it come something out of the Skies it feels like rain falling down I said you'd misunderstand me because you think I don't believe in something happening I don't believe that I believe that she kind of Glory was all over the place falling down but where did it come from coach you better remember that's why I said if you that's why I said I know what the Bible said go back over and read Exodus 30 of Exodus 40. and you'll find that when Moses got that Tabernacle in the wilderness finished everything was okay you remember they could work in there they could do but all at once when that Ark of the covenants was established and put in there they had to back out Moses the man that made the temple backed out and nobody could go behind her but the high priest after that word found its place in that Tabernacle in the wilderness the tent right see the one in Chronicles is the the Solomon building the natural Temple she was coming to a greater time right it doesn't say in Exodus 40 that the Shekinah Glory come down and all of these things let's read it we'll make sure we won't miss it let's go to Exodus 40. so you won't miss what I'm saying so if you save time to read him coming down to get looking for 31 and Moses and Aaron his sons washed their hands and their feet are up when they went into the tent of the congregation and when they came near unto the altar they washed as the Lord commanded Moses now remember you could come in there so far right you know only the high priest could go behind the veil right see once it was made all right what and he reared up the court round about the Tabernacle and the Altar and set up the hang of the court so Moses finished the work now watch then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the Lord filled the Tabernacle right and Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the cloud Abode upon and the glory of the Lord sealed the Tabernacle right all right and when the cloud was taken up from the Tabernacle the children of Israel went onward in their Journey but as the cloud were not taken up then they journeyed not till the day that it would take an up and it was a cloud by that day and a pillar of Fire by night next to our truck he'll get one saying when that Temple was finished back there with Moses the cloud came down come to honor the word but it doesn't say they couldn't minister they could do this because that cloud would raise up out from inside the Tabernacle and it would go off and they'd have to follow it that's what Moses followed nobody else didn't see it he said okay pack up let's go the cloud says move nobody else didn't see it Moses was the only one solitude Pillar of Fire would be there at night when it hovered in one place they camped get what I'm talking about the when they come over there we'll Solomon inside of that Ark of the Covenant develop the presence of the Lord the cloud the pillar of Fire dwelt better word of the anointing come from out of there uh so I'm gonna ask you one more question where's the anointing at now see you ate maybe up to now let's see if you thought of me where's your anointing at man it's inside of you amen amen right all right but that don't mean he can't come out here at enormous and feel his presence and walk and see things and open our eyes to things speak to us but let me see I could preach another couple hours but I won't Elijah was an Acadian one day and he heard Thunders and Lightnings and flashings and all kind of things and he wouldn't get up and walk out is that true and all at once was still a small voice from inside of him spoke he got up and walked out because he knew that was God now he didn't even have a new birth that's it right there man all right but he could be led of God Amen he could be anointed come on Amen but he didn't have the new bird that's right think about that all right Hallelujah see great things can happen to a person that's not born again that's right that's right but the revealing of the word is what I want amen come on revealing of the word is what I want the anointing that anointed that now let me give you one life one that's on the last page of your notes number 19. Daniel 70 weeks brother random says when the bride rides back into the millennial Reign fulfilling Revelation when at 19 I believe it is where she couldn't worth it if you come back to the millennial Reign he said the anointing is up on them right amen thank you the anointing is upon them it's not to come from somewhere else it's inside of you that's the only way I know what the truth is is whatever's inside of me tells me whatever has kept me from following these doctrines enough you know where it's at it's inside of me it's not up here in this head because this head runs Haywire over doctrinal issues but inside of me something says that's not right amen how can I argue with these people that's not right and I'll finish it because you'll think it's a wrong statement but I believe it how is it that I tell you to check a Doctrine how do I check a Doctrine how do you check a doctor brother Dale buy my new birth that's right because that's the only way you're gonna know where it's right or not it's my Year New Birth understand now this is just a background for this afternoon did you see where I didn't finish it last like Wednesday night I left it to where I said that's furniture meaning it was a word but now we see right out of that word right out of that comes the anointing right out of there is where that anointing comes for the whole County amen if we could have seen it it would have just been that color of Fire coming up the cloud because the cloud was in there and it just went up and then it come down and just baptized everybody right where was that anointing at it was inside of Jesus when it went out it come back on the death Pentecost and just anointed it and fulfilled Joel see I've got all these scriptures things written down but I believe you got the point if we'll feel Joel and things like that or what up or at my spirit upon All Flesh anointed lunch but upon my children and my inmates will be it go ahead 272 and spinal anybody have any an orders open bring up it said he'll come to the fat beautiful mother Holy Ghost s understand anybody have any body Our Lives foreign not well the left Fleet father in the name of oh it's bleeding anybody else oh hold it up I am ready foreign information I'm waiting if I am ready here's my life get up see ya never hungry it's not right God's trying to work out things in our hearts and lives but we're still human don't justify nothing it's just true we're still human we think wrong we act wrong but we just gives us cash sometime to see and then one day we've got a test and we find out hey we passed it I got through that without any trouble but just remember who got you through it and things I I live on the island probably here behind God there's no years my brother's asking friends oh we know you make all things well yeah thank you just pray one for another cause we go through tests and we fail you know what tomorrow may be my test the next day may be yours so we pray for each other and that way we make it through oh yeah we don't flunk the circuit right you just got detached to go through again that's right into standard walk nothing wrong falling down I learned to walk that way remember to ride a bicycle because I kept falling down and hurt me and one day I Learned was to do better if I stay up straight and that's what it isn't a Christian Life but just remember that huh father we thank you we love you as we go our separate ways for a few moments Lord eat a natural meal we pray that you would just bless and guide each one remember all those that are not here and just bless them and lead us all in thine understanding forgive our sins and cleanse us and guide us in your grace we love you father we committed all to you now in Jesus name beauticians remember their services out of our Lord it gives me Praise by myself I cannot open I know what he said me here we'll hear my prayers are the words I hear him whisper give me all this life is over and ever foreign
