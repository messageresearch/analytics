so remember the fellowship meeting remember that services on that Sunday only on the 27th and brother Joe's posted it on the internet where people can pick it up and and you know and see what change their time of connecting on all right now so remember the Lord willing Wade will be taking the services Sunday cuz I've asked him to kind of review and cover all in one time of like two messages of what he was doing on the uh Family Matters and things you know and bringing it down especially to the end time of the children and the the things you know doing so uh is that all the announcements I've got all my notes from last 's message um talk to Sister um I don't think every about she's the one that's got the shingles Regina I'll find her I get her name in a minute uh talked to her this afternoon said she was doing good said she would be here the Lord willing Sunday but as of right now now this is what she told me today and I know Terence announced it but as of right now the uh ladies going on the your trip has been cancelled as of right now so you know that we'll think you can find out from her right uh on that amen all right I think that's all that we're supposed to cover okay Matthew 19 and ROM 7 now if we're a little empty i' shove pull Josh an extra battery we had trouble with one Sunday and don't know why but it went out so you know we may have to change that but I'm sorry if I'm a little empty I want to try to finish this tonight all right and then that way if you have any questions on it then we'll go back to that later but I want to try to get through with what I want you to see tonight in the service so if we're a little lengthy forgive me you know and just pray for I mean we generally go out and get out there by 9:00 that's 10:00 four people leave so we get out there at 10:00 maybe everybody to leave in a hurry but you know okay just saying that maybe we might be so forgive me okay father we ask you to just help us Lord tonight as we come to this place that we lord we've we've dealt on for quite a while and talking about the things of Grace and your love unto each and every one of us and showing us the the things that the prophet has brought unto us and we pray that you would just help us tonight as we try to meditate upon these things and speak about them and you bring back to our remembrance Lord because we we want to speak what you would have to be said and forgive our sins lead us by thine understanding remember those that are sick among us Lord and just bless each and everyone Lord we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen amen Matthew 19 verse three the Pharisees came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife forever cause now we covered that not forever cause right only for adultery fornication right right and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female now we've covered for not any cause for put her away and remarry right uh you know we covered the different things in there I need to put it that way is because we're talking about you know putting away and Remar all right and said for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore there are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let not man put us under brother R said man better not try to put us under what God put together all right they say unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away he said unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marit another commited adultery whosoever marit her which is put away do commit adul all right now we go to Romans 7 know you not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law have dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath a husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should walk that we should bring forth fruit unto God amen all right so let's just stop there because we'll we've been through verse six and now going on you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now I I covered something Sunday okay now this will be a lot of this will be reviewing back over that okay and you know because that I wanted something in your mind to think on and if anyone hears this I would invite you to please go back and listen to last Sunday afternoon's message because we're trying to get down to the grace of God Amen now I want to ask you a question just right on the start I love questions and I like to ask them what happened the day the grace of marriage and divorce was given the Prophet come together and gave a Grace now I want to ask you a simple question brother R said they came there with two or three wives two or three husbands right right is that true right amen but when they left did they leave with two or three or did you leave with one now which way was it and we've covered that now as to showing the grace of marriage and divorce through Moses through Paul through brother randam right that you didn't have to be standing there that day sitting there in the building right but it be when you hear it that's right and can accept it for yourself right right amen and then we covered that it was only far the Believers of the message that's it not for everybody amen it's for everybody that can believe the message amen right now the message is the Bible okay now I want to ask you a simple question say that I went there with you know been married three times and when I left if I can accept the grace of marriage and divorce I didn't leave with three wives did I that's right right we've covered that that we wouldn't go back and live with the other two you know we're not in the days of polygamy but they sure a lot of egies out there think so but I want to ask you just simple see I went there with three wives and if I can truly believe the grace of marriage and divorce I'd leave with one one wasn't that's right that's right and you believe that amen now some of you looking at me like you're not going to answer that do you believe that you'd leave with one wife how about a raise a hand amen okay so everybody in the building says we leave with one wife right all right now what happened to the other two right right what took place what took place that day that the prophet said and we gave it over and over that on marriage and divorce he said a a supernatural Revelation because of the opening of The Seven all right and I've preach to you what I believe on that that if we don't have a revelation of the understanding for our individual things not that everybody's going to understand the same and all like that we we never tried to do that right but what we must each one understand to bring us to a position to where that we could receive a supernatural Revelation amen and then we covered that even that brother Brown said Abel had a supernatural Revelation this is just in case some of you missed it so I believe all Revelation is Supernatural amen there's no such thing is a natural Revelation natural Revelation is letters on the page Supernatural Revelation is a revealed word of God all right because of the revealed word of God you could go home with one wife or one husband if you were the the woman you know and having two or three husbands and leaving and going home with one husband all but what happened to the others that was left there what would be your answer to that now we're not talking about going there having four or five wives polygamy right right polygamy uh you know I just plunt okay somebody going there that had two or three wives that were not you know married and divorced and married and divorced and I'm not even talking about that garbage can ain't talking about somebody that would go there and claiming to believe the message but have three or four living common law wives or whatever you want to call it right they're BL enough don't believe in that amen that wouldn't work right so we're only talking about someone who went there that had been married and divorced and married and divorced you know something like that and have two and maybe married a third one or some woman that had married two or three different men but was married and divorced from each one of those and she winds up you know being married to number three guy or something if the truly Revelation could be there they could go home with one but that's what I'm telling you now don't get no polygamy tied up into this this thing cuz that's garbage king that's right don't say that they would be some guy walk up there with three or four living wives you know some situation you know Common laws that wouldn't work cuz that wouldn't even fit nowhere in the Bible right all right now blunt plain but that's where that nobody can argue the point when I get through saying what I will at the end of the message the Lord willing but now so we started covering Sunday a thing that that I told you that I have been dealing with for 40 years about it of a way of trying to express what I could see and I've tried before to express it and preach some of the things that you here and tried to express it and I believe it I still believe what I preached there was right you know and uh but there's something that we need to understand all right so now Sunday afternoon we started on a uh the message talking about that we would cover from the invisible Union and we would would cover three things you remember that three things would be covered we would cover the new birth and to see how that we could be free enough to accept Jesus Christ and him accept us amen all right now then we said we would cover it from the basis of our old husb husband there that brother Brandon will use the old husband as your old adamic nature mhm in the new birth and we'll get to that in a minute but then he picks it up into a higher form of saying about your old husband your old denominationalism amen and you can say well the day I got born again I was set free from all denominationalism well I just call you BL a liar up front and we'll talk about it amen no argument that's plain see what's our trouble is the prophet said that Jesus Christ set us free but we're Bound by our Creeds and ideas and our denominational thoughts that's right oh I don't have any I never was in a denomination you born one the natural carnal mind is organizational ISM right amen all right so then we would cover the new birth and to see how that that old person can die and then we cover the the grace of marriage and divorce extended unto us as we'll read the minute where the Prophet said invisible Union that this is a greater portion of marriage and divorce all right y now so that would be how our old denominational husband can be dead right amen but then we would we'll get down to the grace of marriage and divorce to see the things that is covered to understand who's free and who's not now remember the question I asked you say I went there with three wives when I left we believed that I left one if I really believe it that's right right I'm not to try to go back as we'll read in a little while and pick them up and hang them up in a closet you know to be lived with somewhere down the road or anything no but you know what in that situation is a very odd situation because say that I was married three times and all three of them were still alive you know as far as the world is concerned and far as life and looking that's right those two women would still be living that's right right and going on and maybe remarrying and all kind of things right now number two just because you're a denominational husband that you can see him as he's dead remember it's not going to end it it just goes right on right amen I I mean I come out of the Baptist Church the day did I come out did the Baptist Church Anni late and go away you know come on you come out of the message this brother did that uh you know did that make you just did it just destroy the whole no it didn't destroy nothing did it right how about Brother Gary where did you come out of he just shaking his head about everything you understand what I mean those things are still alive and still going that's right yep and your name may still be on the records of those churches sure you right because they had record books unless you asked for it they wouldn't take it off so what could happen to make that turn out to be the right thing all right now let's approach it as what I said we were going to try to do we will see then that the new birth and the way it comes and what happens will be setting the stage to understand your old husband amen and the ability for him to die your old denominationalism yep then you'll see really what as we'll read in a minute brother BR said you see what happened there at marriage and divorce so I kind of lay that down Sunday to kind of get it in a thought of a a way and I know I'm going to work Brother Anderson and them to death because they had the notes from Sunday and we still got the same quote things but we're going to be jumping so if they get behind a little bit I'll wait on them I done told them I just made up my mind it's change you know to change the route I was going a little bit to understand all right now you know me and what I've always say it how is it that I check a Doctrine that's right by my new birth that's right you say well I check it by the word well if you've got the new birth that is the birth of the word that's not you know but if you don't have the new birth and got the word you can't check anything so I check doctrines and Things by my new birth to see if the those things fit in any realm right if they don't then I say well there's something wrong with my new birth or there's something wrong with their Doctrine then is when we get into the digging into the word to see how it fits so now let's take it so we're going to start reading just a little and we gave these as I said we gave them Sunday and and we're going to be going back over them so you know forgive me and uh pray for me let's go with number one brother Anderson I re yeah he's back there sometimes they swap out on so you know and these these guys do wonderful uh Dale Richard and and Aaron's Daddy was telling how wonderful he said now I get to meet the man that a name goes with he said he'd always say Brother Anderson he said I didn't know who Brother Anderson was I said well it's hard hard be hard for me to pronounce Maron go they say I'm doing pretty good at it we keeping with Brother Anderson all right now look what the prophet is saying Paul here is given an illustration I'm going to read fast on some of these to get through so you can read it up there okay Paul here is given an illustration in our scripture about the law and Grace and illustrating it like marriage and divorce this passage is very seldom preached on because it more or less pertains to like marriage and divorce right Romans 7 is what he's talking about right it pertains to marriage and divorce but it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage and divorce of how that he's trying to set in order here that we as a church can be no more married to the world and to Christ new birth right number one at the same time and be legally and lawfully about it and for a woman living with a husband all right then he said I believe it unfolds one of the greatest mysteries of Prophecy setting an order of scriptures all right now then let's start off with the new birth and let's cover the new birth as the prophet covers it from the invisible Union cuz that was what I asked you to to read and uh so let's see what we've got all right number four that's what I said it's going to take jumping and we're going to be moving so forgive me and you're going to see right up here what I'll be talking about when it comes down that we're we're talking about denominationalism it'll be written there when it comes down to we're talking about marriage and divorce or I believe the prophet is covering it that's what we're going to be covering and it'll be written up there all right amen now so hold on to what we're talking about okay that's all together out of the reaches for her she don't want that oh no sir no indeed what does she do then so she brings forth a power of painted face short bearing Jezebel soci illegitimate cats they call him and I think it's calling come on down I'm going to jump some so just read it in between she was born or married connected with her first husband first husband now who is this first husband he's talking about the first Adam right so that's your natural life so don't deal in organizational ISM and marriage and divorce of how many wives deal with what we're talking about the New Birth she was born Mary connected with her first husband the first Adam by the adulterous wife of Eve Adam's first wife you say adulterous she sure was but oh she claims that this Adam this first Adam is dead now watch oh sure he died a long time ago I'm reborn again she said and I'm certainly married to the second Adam Christ the word see now that's what the basis of organized religion the basis of religion not only organized we call basis of religion is what right the new birth you're born again your old adamic nature for the soul right amen not for your body and spirit now cuz you're not born again your body and your spirit that's right the olamic nature of your soul Y is to die and you are to be reborn now to become a Christian now notice what she loves watch her lover her you want to see who she's in love with and look what he say the word says this but she said my church says this now let time together with denomination L but we're holding a point then who is she L who is she in love with who is her husband her own fruits prove what she is exactly right shows what she is notice she was born first to Adam cuz that's her natural birth see and she never left that and you just people just don't leave it they just move over into another place or brother Mo said get your coat and hat and go to another beeting place all right they don't leave it that's a lover of the world she claims that she's born the second time to Christ but her lover notices Adam yet because she loves the world now all right very small amount of what to explain each point we talked about about the world it's not talking about whether you're living working uh doing this doing that we went through that Sunday it the world is plainly the old adamic nature of natural world and then you see the church you see that they come out of this but then they just go right back into the same thing until the church is now is the most worldly of all right right amen who who is it that you're having to talk about the the shorts the the you know you know understand but they claim to be born again right right that's what makes them adulterous all right and another thing notice what kind of a children she's burying just like her y that tells what their papa is whether it's the first Adam or second Adam if the church brings forth a child of the second Adam he acts the second Adam's way of acting right like they did at the day of Pentecost that's the second Adam that's Christ right that's a really true second Adam's children see right their nature is like his and hers yes sir her daughter is now going back to the other right painted face bobbed hired wearing men's clothing trousers the Bible said for her not to do it she cuts her high it's a shame to her all right now we go to number six okay now I'm trying toing break this down to where you'll see something from it this is still from the invisible Union all of these except the last part will be from invisible Union paragraph 212 now it was nature associated with death your first husband that had ruled over you was your Nature by natural birth natural you love the world because you are the world and part of the world that's right congregation says amen your desires was by nature to love the world which you're part of you're a part of nature you believe that amen that's your natural thing see that's why we just keep on going going and people go to churches and they just keep right on living the same old lives but yet they claim to be married to Christ right that's the reason you have to be born again you have to separate you have to die to that first husband now Mark that one because we're going to come back to that one all right I told you Sunday if you're listening to the message I gave about five different times what I was going to preach on tonight I wonder who wrote it down and checked out what I was doing or even went back and listened to the tape again so that's the reason you have to be born again you have to separate you have to die to that first husband now that's not talking about denominationalism that's talking about we need to burth right we don't blame denominationalism for us being lost right right right we blame the old adamic nature right you can't live with it you you just say well I'll divorce him and hang him up here till occasion so that's what you see churches and people doing right that's right they claim to be married to Christ and they do pretty good for a little while then after a while you see them right back in the same old rut they was in what happen y I've told you about it there before we used to have a man come to to the Baptist Church would have Revival over twice a year and every time he had a Revival he come to church he got an all cried and prayed said I'm through I ain't going to live no more for the devil never made it to the service and I ain't kidding you but I heard later finally came praise the Lord stay okay now but I'm just telling you what happened while I was there you can't just say well I was divorc I'll hang him up no sir no writing of divorcement no now there's no writing of divorcement in the new birth that's right you're not just trying to be divorced or nothing y no writing and divorcement he dies that's right right okay the nature of the world has to die every spec of him has to die you have to be reunited again with another nature amen all right what is it your name of your first nature was born and put in a Book of Life all your Deeds was wrote in it too y Mark that one all your Deeds that's the things we do right everything you done under that nature was put in a book called A Book of Life yep you notice in Daniel when he come to the anel of dayses whose high was as white as wol 10,000 of 10,000 came with him to minister to him the the bride and then the books were open now see there's books there there's the Book of Life of the living and then there's a allow Book of Life which is not two books it's two sections of the same book right the invisible Union that answers it and another book was open which was The Book of Life see there is Saints already there the church the Bri talking about when it open now but when you were separated from him that Union by spiritual death or when you got born again mhm all right your natural desire to cut your heart your nature natural desire to wear shorts your paint your face your natural desire is to intellectual smart man know something better than the other that's what he wanted that's the way that the very thing she wanted well say you little too bit you know too preacher just get on on by that all right but what did Eve do pull up 28 that's what eve took she was pregnated with that kind of a pregnation that's what the church is today by the Bible schools and intellectual and everything all right now what is the new birth what is the prophet saying your name goes on the book as a Believer at at sanctification right those things we could cover a lot on it but just get the new birth in the New Birth your old nature had has to die amen right if it don't die your old husband is still alive right so if you have really the truly new birth right your old husband that's right your old nature your old desires to cut your hair paint your face to do this that and the other it's supposed to be gone amen you see you see why I don't like to preach on hiring dress and clothes because if I'm preaching to Born Again Christians why would I have to preach it that's right now we got new people coming in that's a different thing but why do you have to preach the people to been in the message for one year let alone 40 right amen about their clothes and their hair and their doings and the men and what they're doing see the new bird is supposed to take care of everything right it's supposed to annihilate that old husband now what happens to that old husband we just read you have to die y to be born again you have to die so then if you have to die to that first husband then what about it let's see where did we get to paragraph let's go try to save time um paragraph 221 well you're separated from your first Union by spiritual death now you are born again or remarried again to the new spiritual union of not your natural life of the things of the world that's right but of eternal life that germ that was in you at the beginning found you that's all right look at the next one now your old book is gone with your old union now your name and your old in your has been transferred now you say you mean to tell me that my old book God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness amen remember what we were saying while ago your acts and things was written and put in a book mhm called The Book of Life right your na Etc was put in a book of life that's right records of what we done the Deeds we done under the old was put in a book and kept y all right now if that's not cleared y amen those deeds are still there amen that's right now what happened to those deeds well God put it in the SE of forgetfulness all right I love that but now we're going to get a little bit better word in just minutes so hang on you stand perfectly before God now your name is now in the new book not the book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life what the lamb redeem not the old book of your natural Union but your new bride Hallelujah your new life life is in the Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate Hallelujah where your true Eternal Journey from the beginning takes hold now you're not only forgiven but you're Justified Glory Justified Romans 51 said what yeah Romans 51 said therefore being justified by faith Look up the word the word don't mean forgiven the word means Justified it don't mean you're forgiven nope that's right now remember in The Invisible Union your natural things a woman could be forgiven but never could be justified right yep because you can't restore that right amen we'll get to that in a minute that true now but he ain't talk talking about your natural acts now he's talking about the new birth right all right so in the New Birth we can find that we're Justified you know the story for instance you heard I got drunk and done evil things and everything then you come around and say to me you found out I didn't do them see you found out then you come around and say brother ROM I forgive you forgive me I didn't do it at all didn't do it at the first place now if I didn't do it if now if I did do it I'm guilty right but you could forgive me and I wouldn't be guilty but yet I'm not justified because I actually done it y right but the word Justified is though you never done it amen and don't get it all confused as I said right the Natural Things of life that people done can be forgiven but they can't be justified amen that's right in your marital situation why because the new birth doesn't take that away as everybody you know people wants to think that and I'm not preaching the new birth I'm typing we'll get to that in the minute typing the new birth is a typ right and you'll see in your type what happens in the antitype all right but the word Justified is though you never done it amen it's not even regarded at all yep how is it done how's it done that nothing is regarded to that soul to that individual to buy that new birth yep in God's book of sea of forgetfulness your old book and marriage is divorced and dead now watch if he had stopped on that divorce that's right it would have been a problem wouldn't he but he said divorced and dead yep it's not even in the memories of God amen you're Justified therefore being justified it was accused you was accused you never done it in the first place now what's he saying the old Union is in the sea of God's forgetfulness you wasn't married to it to begin with he the bridegroom bore your shame himself for you in your place he took your place for you were predestinated for him to be for him to be in his bride before the foundation of the world the said so you are the predestinated seed amen right now the new birth if you have the new birth tonight yet that Soul there is no marks against it amen that's right it don't matter how many times you've been married right right if you're born again now you understand me that's right amen not if you claim to be and then run out here and all this sudden I'm talking about garbage can if you truly have the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth there's nothing against that Soul amen it's as though you never done it now you know we've done preach out invisible Union many many years the prophet actually says the real you never did do iten that's right he talking about the soul the new birth right amen well wouldn't that do away with the the things of the body no no cuz you got to have something to cleanse that body with amen right all right so where are we at paragraph 228 let me see are we on number seven yet all paragraph 262 okay they getting faster n he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life that's right that's what the Bible said your first husband that you were married to the world Amen the anointed bridegroom which for ordained you has washed you by the washing of the Water by the church Mar said no that don't sound right do no you might find that in the almanac but not in God's Bible by the washing of the Water by the word it's the word in in the word by the you are standing completely Justified as as though you never did it at the beginning and remember we're talking about the New Birth y but if we can see the new birth typ yep the next stage and the next stage it'll fit together that's right then you'll see listen what it say you are standing completely Justified as though you never did at the beginning this is my message to the church now as you as we go off the hour just in a minute you're standing if you're standing on God's word with God's word every amen every jot every K where you're standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from them Shucks and get out here in the week where you can get right before the sun I hear the coming of the combine you're standing complete Justified like you never did it in the first place Hallelujah am talk about a Thanksgiving I feel real good I am more thankful for the for that than anything I know of you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born by the spirit of God you ain't talking about everybody right that's right every man that's man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stand as though you never sined at the first place amen you are perfect the blood of Jesus Christ how can you if a man if I was supposed to die in the morning a man took my place I cannot die for that sin somebody took my place and Jesus the word took my place he became me a sinner that I might become him the word amen amen let me hold true to it not the church the word all that spiritual union of Christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested Vindicated just what the Bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day when it's humal fast out there in the desert and things taking place that I couldn't even keep up with it we're near the coming of Jesus Christ to be United with his church where the word becomes the word call of the Holy Spirit searching the hearts right watch it you're standing complete now by the new birth now that's the reason I want you to get this get what the new birth makes you m on the future home run around trying to explain the city and all and trying to he said if you don't get nothing else get this new birthed amen cuz there ain't going to be no future home far you a't no New Birth sir right so look you're standing complete you never sin it to first place how is it that you never sin you know you sin everybody else knows you sin right you catch the key of how that that guy goes home with one I can go home with one wife and what happens to them other two it's in the SE of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God you're standing there wased and your old book of divorcement is put away Y and it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God now that's how perfect the new birth is You're The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless son of the Son of God standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he's Washed by the Water of his own blood that become flesh and manifested he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was he was the great attribute of God Called Love what whatever you are you are Servants of God whatever God wants you to do where's your place God placed in the church Apostles and Prophet Pastor he placed that by virtue of his own predestination that you were there to begin with your first wedding was a nulled now you talking about wedding he ain't talking about marriage and divorce situation that's right he ain't talking about organized religion no he's talking about the New Birth amen right no your first wedding was no it was you never done it in the first place now how could that be because there's only one thing could do it what that God that would be God come down himself and took your place in the form of the Son of God Jesus Christ and washed you by the water of the washing of the Water by the word the word not the denomination see the word was you but if you won't stand in the water of the word how you going to be washed you're still as spotted as was where we up to got 272 okay but I'm having to hold on to this okay we're up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 right right we've done covered seven okay now so we can see we can see as as the prophet would be covering it by the new birth We Stand perfectly totally sinless in the soul amen of the individual that's right not in body and spirit now because it doesn't take away those things you say oh yeah did M well why is your old husband still alive that's right why you thinking that y well if I'm perfectly that's in the soul amen ever born again believer is perfectly totally sinless in the presence of almighty God Amen and we're going to use some quotes now going to tie together with it so now listen so then now what are we going to do the new birth is a top mhm any of you that's got the notes you look down on the side of it you'll see to to to to to right but you see what's wrong with us church is even though our soul is born again we were married to organized religion and that's why I believe that he call married indivisible unions a greater portion because people would go there with two or three wives and go home free and say Glory Hallelujah I'm free but what did it change in them right back on to the same churches they come out of right Y and that's what some done when brother ROM passed away y now so God had to come down and give you and I a new birth that's right and we're going to read it in just a minute where brother R said God let it die amen see that's what happened to our old adamic nature but this you're looking at in the spirit that's within me is my old adamic nature still that's right it's not born again amen and it's subject to the world and the things of the world oh no I'm a Christian since I've become a Christian I had sin but like who was it Jack Cole said go sit down lady the biggest Li here good point see church is Christians who have sins amen right that's right and our biggest sin is our denominational thoughts we've had that's right amen you said they done they helped us yes they did now I've told you that I don't have to talk back to you here right somebody out there that's just hearing at one time might not understand me but this church understands me amen I'm not going to off on no kind of people right we all come from denominational yes sir to come into this message but did we come into the message and get rid of all of our denominationalism right why would a prophet say if he didn't have some problems now come on why would he say I would have made a horrible mistake that's right on that first seal if God hadn't to come down and straighten the it that's right that's right come on that's his words now you're making brother randam all messed up brother Rand wasn't all messed up but he had enough organizational ISM left in him until he needed something to set him free right and that's what the seals brought to the man amen right the Plan of Redemption amen all right and so we cover the new birth that makes that Soul perfect and pure and complete now let's go into the second stage to the basis of old denominational husband and brother R said every denom there is come out of Genesis that's right amen now no matter whether we ever belong to a church or not even the Beast organized the thing right organizational ISM has always been and always will be the Antichrist movement all right but those are good people out there brother Dale you know better to quote back with me on that do you know what I've been what I told you right those are great people out there some of those people out there make me and you ashamed ofel the lives they live and the things they that's right that's what bothers me amen come on brother it may not bother you but that bothers me amen you want to go with me with Walmart that Commerce sometime and you'll never go over there that you don't find a bunch of women with dresses dragging the ground and hard bonds tied around their heads and their things they're making their statement you know I'm telling the truth you know there's people that out there in the world that would dare not cut their hair it's like the Catholics would dare not even to have birth controls because why because they think it's contrary the word so don't don't get on it somebody out there now you you can misunderstand brother Dale but not this church and see if you ever need anybody just call back here in this church will tell you that this is the way I've always been amen I've always been one thing with you we've all got problems amen right but that's not to be justified and do nothing we're trying to get rid of them and do you know that the reason we can't understand one God correctly is why come on why is it you can't understand one God correctly because somebody taught you a trinity or a oness situation right so that's denominationalism all right so our soul can be perfectly totally ped by the baptism of the Holy Ghost now I'm going to put it in their hearts okay very few of you have ever claimed receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost after you come here so you must have got it somewhere else yeah come on brother you got it I try to pre that so you mean you got it while you out there an organized religion I'll agree with you you did I'm not going to argue with you my point is you still have the same organization on mine yep right yep the new birth could be there amen but we still have the same organization ational mind see me and my idea you can't tell me that what most people say but now listen folks I'm going to put this blunt I said it the other day and I'm going to say it again if a dumb donkey tells you the truth and you reject that truth you got an organizational Spirit right amen the old husband's not dead that's right now that's right the old HB husband of organizational ISM what made Cain kill Abel yep cuz Kan thought he was right right that's right right what made Eve go wrong in the beast in the garden brother Rand said she thought she was right that's right now is that a good enough case to lay it down to see what organization ism is I'm not against that church over there you heard brother random say it I'm not against people he said I'm against a system amen that organizes contrary to the word that won't take what the Bible says right that's what we're against and so is it with the people of this message see it won't take what the prophet said amen even worse than organizing religion you know me I've never been out there beating on them across the street over here right I do anything in the world I could for them people and could probably preach Freer right in some of them I know my nephew invited Wade to come and preach for him and my nephew told him said if you hold anything back it's your problem you tell it like it is you know might find some better spirits out there right that still don't change nothing does that's right cuz we're trying to get rid of organizational am you remember that brother that left church up there because that they uh their church is so and so o g.org org organizational you know the man left the church been going for years on count that he had a great Revelation didn't he but you understand now where we're going to stage two is everybody clear we cleared stage one how is it you're born again you got to die right now how can you die so we'll read it in a minute the better word of using God let it die that's right that's ah God let that old nature that you and I were born with and that's the guy we feed all the time in the body and spirit realm of us is still hooked up in organizational ISM amen God let the nature of that Soul how did he do that you answer me how could he come down and drop down into your soul and give it eternal life right that's hard to comprehend is that's right yes sir he had to BU P all of his do I like what brother BR we read there God came down y so God let that old nature die right he uned your marriage y to the old nature he divorced it but remember I kept saying it I rephrase again see he killed it yep now if I went there with three wives and I came home with one what happened to those two follow amen so now let's go to quote number two brother let's talk about this old husband let's go down just to paragraph 57 all right so is the church when when she tries to mix Creed and denomination with the word of God she can't be married to a denomination and be the bride at the same time she's got to be dead to one or the other watch this one or the other watch these dead and he let it die and the things the law says so here there's plenty of laws in God's word that's the law Paul speaking the same here she cannot be married to a church of worldly Creed and be the bride of Christ because she is contrary to the other now you remember that go to number three and now remember what's up here is what we're talking about amen now she is a woman if she is married to Christ the word she cannot be married to a church denomination at the same time or she's Bound by it she shall she cannot live with both husbands at the same time come on they're contrary one to the other one is God sent the other one is manmade so they contrary said let every man's word be a lie mine be true God said just as much contrary to one another as law was to Grace as Paul's speaking of here one one must be dead to have the other and if she's married tries to mix them excuse as she tries to mix them she shall be called an adulteress he's talking about the church right right he talking about the bride right oh no no no he talking about well he's dividing between he's getting the bride putting her there if you can't read go ahead Paul's speaking here she tries to mix them she shall be called an adulterous oh think of it New York Arizona Across the Nation think of it God said if she's if she tried to be married to two at the same time she shall be called an adulteress what adulteress can enter Heaven would God marry an adulteress certainly not he asked us not to do it she shall be called an adulteress he's talking about the bride of Christ right right you oh no no that well read the look right amen the Bride of Jesus Christ our problem is is we're caught in organizational ISM if you don't think that's right go out there in the message and just listen to some of the doctrines worse than it is in any organized religion the Baptist ain't that messed up right right you don't like that just take it h but look now where' we go to 71 contrary one to another you shall be called in adulterous all right go to number five paragraph 153 so to be married to the second Adam Christ now the second Adam is y the old was the first Adam was your lost nature of the soul the second Adam was Jesus Christ the Savior now watch what he said so to be married to the second Adam of Christ the word you must separate yourself by Death from your first denominational husband that's right okay amen because there isn't a one of them that can take all the word of God just show me where that one is at oh you say mine Lula come on the other fell says his twoo put them together and you find out you're both wrong soon as you denominate read Revelation 10:17 so you see you got the dead got to be dead from that thing he said I'm not speaking to this local assembly I'm speaking all together Across the Nation you must be dead to your first husband if you're United to Christ and still married to a denomination you're an adulterous you are a lady of sea now I know because I feel a rebound maybe off the tape I need to explain but I feel a thought coming see that saying well how can we be born again in the soul and still be in a denominationalism will you tell me how you could be born again you claimed you as Born Again a lot of before you come to the church right you know the truth of this message you tell me how you was see that just puts you back in your mouth but I'm trying to tell you the new birth is a birth birth of the Soul amen that's right you could be born again out an organized religion but you're not going to stay there when you hear the truth you'll come to it that's right see because that Holy Spirit will will bring you to the word so you be sitting right now this is full of organized religion tonight is can be and still be a true born again Christian right right cuz Church see we've never had to face what you and I are facing we're facing the end time to wor that if we don't get things right we're not going to walk out of here that's right we're going by the grave that's what I've tried to tell you for 40 years that the biggest portion of people this message are going to go by the grave because they can't stand there with Rapture and Faith to be changed in the moment a twinkle of an eye and I never said nobody wasn't going to heaven they're going to have to come up because of those that can stand there and become the word amen amen that's right now you know I preached that 40 Years to you see because if you and I don't become the word here we're going by the grave that's right amen that's right sure we'll come up and go up in with the rest of them in the Rapture yeah but we won't be there when the won't chain them won't twinkle an ey that's right that's going to be a word born bride folk that's right that's going to be somebody that everything can be set that's right all right where do we get to 155 mhm the church cross the nation we're following Jesus Christ the word to be in the bride you have to be remarried to the word of God which is Christ now why would he be preaching something like that to people that are already born again we got to be remarried why go we got old denominational husband that's aggravating this body and spirit that I'm living in that's right hope you can understand it the word which is Christ in the beginning was the word word with God and Word was God and the word made flesh and go on as long as you hold to man's tradition of denomination you are called in God's word and adultery as long as you're a denominational Creed Seeker belonging to a denominational church that denies the word you are an adulterous what the Bible said and that's why I said it over and over to you the people this message is just as messed up so it's this as big a denomination as there is anywhere else so you know I'm not throwing off on people out there across the street over here that's right I'm talking about me and you amen that's right that's right come on Jesus said you cannot serve two Gods at the same time you either serve God or Mammon mamom is the world he that loves the world or the things of the world the love of God is not even in him the seed of God can't be in him the same time the love of God now watch you the love of the world is in there when the seat of God is operating through you that's the word of God the love of the world can't be in there at the same time now where is the short High and the shorts and the painy face and you know where's it at what are we on number that's number five okay we're up to number eight and we know that that church could not Pentecostal Church by no means by no means could carry out the last day message in his present day condition could it right that's right and you see what Pentecostalism is gone to Pentecostal church is gone to in our day what was it back there and compare it to what it is now right it wouldn't even look like a religious Society to now compared to back d right that's that thing that they've got on the the internet now to where they up in Indiana that that's going on about the message well bring it on right man right I think thank God that brother Colin stood there and I maybe shouldn't say it but it's true he said we're not upgrading William Brandon we're holding up Jesus Christ that's right and that man at least he made his statement right I'd hated for a lot of other people have been asked that question yeah right the Pentecostal Church can't do it why can't even agree on one or two words in the Bible now don't that beautifully fit the message people can't agree that's right you go right over here in South Carolina there's about six or eight churches within miles of each other that you can walk one to the other and none of them agrees with each other well who am you don't agree come on bring me the message and see whether I believe it or not right amen I've invited you I'm not going to argue with you over internet you call me at my home we'll sit down and talk anytime you want to on this men right because I believe it can't even agree how you going to do it they can't do it see you see denominations out yep that's right I'm going it's going to be an elected people that's elected for you see right now know and so do every one of us know that the whole rank of denominations no Pentecost all are dead and watch I didn't say these things yep that's right that is to the born again Christian of the message amen and come on folks we're not throwing off on them but you know what I'm talking about it's the truth that's right you go back to the churches you come from and you just try to talk a little bit about the word you go back to the churches of this message you come from and just try to talk a little bit about the word that's right and you'll find out in a hurry their old denominational husband ain't dead right but look what he said he said it's dead now what used to be the move of God is now dead amen there's only life in this message amen that's right that's it come on absolutely and watch you even agree to elected and you know and so do every one of us that the whole rank of denominational Pentecostal and all are dead that is to the born again Christian of the message uh-huh your first husband is dead you know he's dead read that with me God let it die now God let that old husband of denominationalism die if we are born again Christians trying to follow the word of the hour because they're dead and he let them die y keep that in mind now do we get through in a minute we'll try to do it's finished all of this scientific intellectual educational scientific ways of it so-called Bible schools and things is perished what's it done separated Oneness here and trinities here and the tunist here and over here and down here and Lula down that way and such a mess up and call themselves Pentecost right all right where we at did we finish up number eight number nine got yeah now remember God let it die amen number one now how did you get born again that's right God let your old adamic nature die through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the fire of God talking brother this today about the fire of God that comes and cleanses out all of that that's right why John called the Holy Ghost and Fire not two different things it's the Holy Ghost burning it out as it comes in to live amen God let it die God let your old nature die sister Gil to them to the world children we're still in the world we still live like the world I didn't kill everybody around us no he just killed us right amen and God let it die right amen now what happened we come up into the old husband of organized religion how we going to get rid of it you cannot kill a denominational husband just by reading the word no right come on now read it just as much as you read it that's right mhm but through the revealed word amen God can let that old husband die amen sure the buildings are still out there the world still out there going so all them husbands and wi still going at sitting there today the prophet said the grace of God but as far as God is concerned y your sins were put in the sea of God forgetfulness right as far as God is concerned it is gone everybody else can remember it and you can still remember it but God can't remember it amen amen the stature of a perfect man the revealing of God's word bringing us up through faith virtue all St bringing us back to the faith of the fathers did the faith of the fathers have any denominationalism come on we ain't talking about the people that went off from there right we're talking about show me where Peter Paul and him had denominationalism right uhuh now right they didn't have their own ideas a lot of people went off from there with their own ideas but no those disciples didn't have it you see that's why I've always contended for the faith do we need to preach the statue of a perfect man to where that we can get back to the faith of the father that's right cuz they didn't have no denominationalism righten but they just didn't have anything to carry him on right see because that was to wait till the end time all right now we're in closing saying this finishing up the Great Commission how could they do it we know they're dead God let it die in this scientific age of all what so he could do what God let it die so he could do what open up the seven seal mystery to the undenominational bride not to everybody El amen how can a denomination accept those Seven Seals when it's absolutely contrary serpent seed and all of those other things the whole full seven Mysteries is contrary to what they had been taught because they took the old school from their Bible School Y and the Seven Seals of God when it was opened there on the mountain God let let God know let me die right now at this pull pit if that ain't the truth and I foretold you a year and 6 months before happened what he told me go to Arizona and what would happen out there in the desert and there's men sitting here right here tonight was standing right there and present when the seven angels come came down come down and even the magazines live magazine packed the article of it it's right there in the observatory everything now they don't even know what took place out there now let's see that that's not the same one we just finished is it just continuation you get it though God let it down that's right so we can open the Seven Seals to the BR Di and those seven seals are supposed to kill her old denominational husband amen right amen so God let it die so we could get a new birth amen he let that old nature die that we could get a new birth God let them denominations die now they're out there having revivals and having all kind of sweeping movements we're not talking about that right but they're dead to the word amen that's right and I'm not outs there we're in here the nominations among this message is what I'm talking about amen God let it die how brother Dale then do you check a denominational doctor or an idea in this message y by my new birth right what do you do right God let it die okay let's jump up a little bit more maybe we might get through a little after n okay now let's go back to par to number one paragraph 151 I'm number five excuse me paragraph 151 what it said we had to jump on these now so if we if we get back here so just bear with them out there we get number five paragraph 151 but I a using in these notes at all and notice the Bible plainly says here that her first husband must be dead and you see what I got it here this is invisible Union y now he's talking about marriage and divorce yep BL says here that her first husband must be dead not just put away he's got to be dead I just got through preaching on marriage and divorce and you all know about it I'm not speaking now all together this congregation here but out across the Nations all right now you see what happened there in marriage and divorce when the Seven Seals was opened that brought out the real truth of it that's right and you see what happened there we went to number one right right number one the new birth that old husband is dead God let it die give you the new birth right sure number two organized religion God let it die open the seals and bring in the message to you and I to a non-denominational bride right that she could become the word and in that because of a supernatural Revelation because of the opening of The Seven Seals what he said on marriage and divorce that he could say go on As You Are what happened there you see what happened there in marriage and divorce y do you see what happened during marriage and divorce over what I preached so far that's right let's get to the next one paragraph 307 which is from number nine that's my message to you you that's a union spiritual union by the word m that you're you're dead to those old husbands yep you're born to new don't try to dig him up he's dead amen if you're are born again Christian that little germ that was predestinated to you it's word coming on word and word on word and word on word coming into the full stature of Christ that's right so he can come get his bride now you're just ready for one thing that's the coming of the Lord amen he let that old husband die number 11 taken from the message and you notice what we got up here New Birth denominational marriage and divorce that was what was on that license did you read it right all three of us coming together in one quote right what paragraph 250 of God's only provided place of worship you're sealed in there you're beneath the blood you don't go out no more and then what are you God Son son in God's family sealed in by the Holy Spirit the Devil Couldn't get you if he had to for you are dead your old husband part is dead and you are buried and your life is hid in God through Christ and sealed out by the Holy Ghost how's he going to get you how are you going to get out you're there Glory oh I'll leave that alone just enough so that you'll know what I'm talking about number 12 and notice the Bible flame uh this is falling back to Invisible Union cuz that's what I want down here this is a repeat of what it just had this moment ago so look and I just got through preaching on marriage and divorce paragraph 152 and you all know about that I'm not speaking now allog together this congregation here but out Across the Nation now you see what happened happened there in marriage and divorce and then Seven Seals broke y now remember the way I preach you 1963 they broke to brother Brown amen that didn't make them broke to me and you no sir that's why everybody goes back tries to make 63 as the coming of the Lord is something it's when the seals are broke to you and man amen that's right there is when we can see our old husband dead that's right there will know what happened in marriage and divorce that's right that's right amen sir now what happened in marriage and divorce go home as you are your old husband's dead right might have went there with three wives I left I had one y what happened to them two that's right now if you want all night I got the scriptures L here if you want to cover them I'll be glad to go through it with you just some things if you want to read it Romans 6:1 what shall we say then shall we continue to sin that Grace May abound God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein yep know ye not that so many of us as we baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death amen therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father even so we Al we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him amen that the body of sin amen might be destroyed and henceforth we should not serve sin this is the body of sin amen we've got to realize it's dead amen all right for he that is dead is free from sin I'm read scripture Romans 6 1-7 now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death has no more dominion over him right for in that he died he died under sin once but in that he liveth he liveth under God likewise there likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed under sin but alive under God through Jesus Christ Our Lord but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held right that's it amen we were dead y he gave you a new birth that we should Ser in uness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth amen there's the worldly Church system that's it dead once he living yep who his own self by our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins now this is from first Peter that LIC was from 1 Timothy 5:6 this is 1 Peter 2:24 who his own self our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sin should live under righteousness by who by whose Stripes ye are healed amen listen church as far as God was concerned if you went there with two wies and saw the grace of marriage and divorce or if you see it tonight by the opening of the word thank you Lord if you can see it you can see that old husband is dead if you went there with three wives and went home with one where as God is concerned those other two are dead yep dead not in the bases of natural life but dead in the existence of a connection to you but it's really an embarrassing situation right cuz you marry a woman and you got a kid by you divorce her and you marry another and you got a kid by you marry number three and you got a kid by you got three kids all by different women what are you going to do throw away the other two that's not yours you know in the bases of trying to come home from marriage and divorce and come home with one wife and one kid what are you going to do no right I've done preach to you what I said you ought to do go to take care of them kids the rest of their Liv amen they're yours amen you're Duty bound to them well I'm not going to do it well then you're not a Christian that's solve the problem get mad at me you're not a Christian what I told you about Paul Paul was faced with polygamous situations people there with 10 wives maybe or more cuz it just coming over into to the New Testament form I be Paul said you pick out which one's yours and you go home with her and you ain't living to the rest of them but you better make sure the rest of them kids is took care of that's right that's right amen you see you don't have no proof of that now you don't have no proof that I ain't right either M that's right because I believe it's time to to settle it all that's right you see you might have come here tonight two or three wives or two or three husbands but you can really believe it the only way you can be free from them Brother Gary is for that husband or that wife to be dead that's scripture she married to another man while her husband's still living but now watch she can't go divorce it and start over again no that's right but if she went there with two husbands she'd come home with one husband right that other husband is dead as far as God is concerned and it better be as far as you're concerned that's right that's right cuz wouldn't that be something like brother R said hang up in the closet what do you think he's talking about that's right you get mad at your wife get mad at the husband run back over there and py patter her around a little bit with the old wife or husband I tell you what I'm a mean old man I know it but don't you ever the you that have been married to or three times don't you ever start comparing your husband or your wife with the former one you had that's right that's right I'll tell you one thing that is not the Holy Spirit no that's right you go live from where you are straight on yep don't say well boy you you just don't cook like my first wife or you don't smell like my first husband I try to make it funny where you life instead of making it too hard and strong we're talking about Christianity folks that's right like I said while ago how can you tell a woman that that keeps on cutting her heart yep and she says she's a Christian right and you tell her she's lost right she don't like it she don't like it but you see church it's time to lay it on the line amen right I hope you understand I'm going to go through it one more time but I don't want this misunderstood because that's the only way that I've ever seen that I could explain it by that new birth God let that old adamic nature that we had die amen so he could come and live into us and give us a new birth our old denominational husband our ideas and things that are contrary to the word thank you Lord God let it die but sometimes we still hanging on to it well I got a right to believe what I want to you're not a Christian when you say you got a right to believe what you want to is that blunt enough you're not a Christian Christians don't have rights we forfeit every one of them right well so is it with marriage and divorce of Grace yes sir right that person went home that day with one wife and one husband they set free right that old husband or old wife was dead it better be dead to you not hung up in a closet no that's right do you understand what I'm saying is our old husband dead is our old denominationalism dead is our natural wife or natural husband are the dead God let it die that's right if we'll let it die right there's where the problem is God let it die M but if we let it we let it die that's see church then that way Christ can come and live people that walk off of this Earth in a Rapture and a chain them M TW go now their husband going to be dead they may see him every day walk in the streets they may see them every time they go to Walmart and Heaven help you to turn your nose up that's right just say Heidi how you doing and welome don't take you four hours to do that does it we got a little time we'll so we can talk no we can't talk we don't have nothing to talk about except Christianity invite them to church right let be too embarrassing you mean you don't want people stay what holy and pous idea you got right come on folks it's time to get it down flat right why wouldn't you want an old husband or an old wife that you had sitting down here here in the gospel that's right right probably wrong way well I just couldn't do that cuz I'd be nervous and be I thought she was born again come on I thought we was born again what about it of any of the three situations that we talked about is our old husband dead God let it die but if we let it die that's right that's right or do we keep digging it up come on Brothers we keep digging it up that's try any questions any thoughts anybody has right them down we'll be glad to try to cover them try to help us to see a way to see that the old husband is dead God let it die don't ever forget that statement God let it die that's right that's what Grace is Grace is unmar favor that God let it die let's Let It Die there just people I don't want to be around because they've done this why what's the problem well you just don't understand these people been mean to me what if those that you've been mean to don't want you around them right let it die amen I'm going to end with one statement that you know that I've made this from the beginning any of you women any of you men I still especially woman I refer to you for some unknown reason you get mad and upset with each other and you don't go ahead and be husband and wife what's wrong with you that's right that's right I mean in every way way that's right you know what I told sister Trudy and sister call her name CU she not here I said if you travel 5 hours home and your husband want something to eat you say bless God I've been with the work I ain't cooking you nothing go get it yourself and that's not Christian that's not the lady that was rubbing on the floor you know when her husband deliberately throw the eggs down and from that he become converted in his buddy too that's right what about it church is our old husband dead you know it's been a hard road to some people and I'm talking about myself as well as you because this message is totally contrary to any organized religious message that was ever brought amen right cuz it's not that we're trying to be mean we're trying to find out what the Bible say amen amen right and do what it said Lord let's stand 109 in the red book Standing on the Promises anybody have a need
