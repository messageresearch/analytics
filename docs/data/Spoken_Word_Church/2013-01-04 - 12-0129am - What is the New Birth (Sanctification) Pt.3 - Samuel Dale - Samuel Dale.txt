yes with me with me jesus oh oh hallelujah yes hey man let's all say it this time we'll change over the service open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart eyes of my heart i am living pour out your power and love as well i lifted it up oh good to see you about in the house of the lord if you'd like to turn in your scripture terminal we've been reading a couple of services john 3 and then we will go to second thessalonians 2. remember all with requests remember wade's up preaching for brother dutch today and we got a good report from brother ray said it was on the um facebook or what you say that brother daniel gibson was doing good they were worried about him and thought he had a stroke and things but he said if he had any trouble the lord healed him so we thank god for for being with him and taking care of him and then just keep praying for it and uh remember the bible study will be this coming saturday six o'clock and remember to pray for uh a friend of danny's a little baby that we've been praying for for quite a while he's four years old and he no fellow passed away so you know just uh just remember the family just pray for them the lord we would bless and take care of them and be with them you know and comfort them in this time yeah john three and second thessalonians any other announcements that needs to be made brother ray i like church brother his mother passed away friday night luke gibson's mother passed away friday night so remember him and just be praying that the lord would touch him and everything or any others always forget something heavenly father we thank you for your loving your grace and to us today we thank you for loving us lord and caring for us when we didn't even care for you at all we thank you for saving us lord because there's no way we could save ourselves we're listening to the prophet last night and you're saying some people say that god helps those who cannot help themselves but lord we we know we cannot help ourselves but we can can be in you lord and let you help us and if we could help ourselves then you wouldn't need you lord just have your way forgive our sins lead us as we read your word blessed be with these that have lost their their loved ones the little little baby their lord four year olds be with the family lord and brother luke gibson's mother passing away just remember them and just bless each one thank you for being with brother daniel taking care of him and just let everything be okay we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen john 3 there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that god are a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god nicodemus says unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit marvel not that i say it unto thee you must be born again now our thought will be coming from this scripture in ii thessalonians 2 and verse 13 but we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brethren be loved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the word you may be seated lord that is listening to the reading of the word now we know that jesus is we're trying to bring out speaking to nicodemus and you know telling them you you must be born again and uh you told him he must be born of water and a spirit in other words you must have uh your water baptism and then your holy ghost baptism water and spirit i i want to go over and just pick up a scripture that i'm looking at this morning let's see if i can find it and uh just let that be tied together it's first john 5. first john 5 verse 6 this is he that came by water and blood even jesus christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth now just looking at that scripture this morning thinking about you know what it's actually saying because for us to have a new birth we realized that jesus christ had to die well then it was and i've got some quotes in there that i ran off after i looked at that a little brother brown said the thing that constituted the new birth you know going through justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost of water blood spirit you know and he said it came from the body of jesus christ to be able to give us a new birth to constitute the new birth all the elements came forth so that it would be water blood you know water and and and you know when there when they pierced its side out came the water and blood as it joined together and then the life was released and then it could come back upon the believer uh there in the book of acts so i was just looking at that point i thought that was very uh complementary of the prophet saying that the things that would constitute our new birth was the things that come from the lord jesus christ and that's we know that to be true but i'm just saying it was it just stuck out to me when i began to see those things this morning looking at it but now we're talking about what is the new birth now the lord willing this afternoon i hope we will not be lengthy i will try not to be because i have to i'll break it up but uh i want to get into something about the new birth that i believe is very confusing to people and we'll try our best to express it you know this afternoon so if we're a little lengthy i'll tell you now so you can lay out this afternoon and uh you know you won't have to fool with me but uh you know uh we just say well what is the new birth amen and see they've come in the message now to say that that it's not uh three stages of grace or anything that brought around change later and says now it's just the baptism well i read where brother branham and i've got them i'll try to bring it this afternoon where he said you say it's just the baptism now he's not talking about the anointing on your spirit now and we know that can happen you can have the anointing on your spirit to be lost but he said the pentecostal say it's just the baptism he said you're wrong you know so you know i hope that goes out and some people will listen to it but won't do any good other than to the predestinated seat and that's that's all we're talking to anyway but we're not going to argue with anybody about what they believe you believe what you want to as long as you don't try to make me believe that's the difference you know all right but see we've been talking about and we spent a couple of messages speaking on uh justification and how that you know justification is a chopping off of your past sins and i've asked you to please uh read or listen to the tape the future home i hope you have and will because it would help you you know especially about 15 16 17 of the the book and we've given you most of that through the quotes but now we want to to just talk a little while and and try to get something about sanctification as we did on justification because trying to show you that it's a work of the holy spirit but it's not it's not a work it's not three words of grace it's a working of the holy spirit but it's the same holy spirit it's not three works of grace we gave that to you and you know and i'll just quote these words to be on the tape that brother around says on he swore by himself paragraph 140 um 54 12 12 it's not three works of grace then he goes on to questions and answers and law having a shadow 54 516 e14 said it's not three words but it's three manifestations right just like it is with three manifestations of god and he said i taught those three stages on christ on the future home he said i taught it from the beginning and have it changed my doctrine so now when we get down this afternoon you're going to think he changed see because i'll tell you that up front because it's it's a confusing point of a lot of the statements brother branham makes it's confusing if you don't lay it in perfect order and get it right you know it is confusing because it does look like that he taught it one way and he taught it another way and backwards and fourth but i've always been one that is kind of uh i guess when you see a controversial point that it stirs my curiosity all right and i don't mean because i'm not gonna argue with you about nothing that way i'm not gonna you know i don't mean that the wrong way i just mean when when things like daniel 70 weeks where brother brown said if you don't understand daniel 70 which you can't understand the seals i didn't say that he did well then uh you know i began to study in that realm to see what he was really talking about to try to bring it to understanding and things and uh you know he's standing he'd say uh let's stand now we're blessed we'll uh approach or pray to the to the third person of the trinity when you know he never taught a trinitarian doctrine see in those things when they come up see it it makes people think that there's so many contradictions and things throughout the message and they think the same thing of the bible because they don't wait long enough for it to be able to come together and be a revelation amen and i don't claim to understand everything but i'm just saying that does uh bring me to a point that i think well now the people needs to understand and we were listening last night to a tape uh i would ask you to listen to one where let's see i'll try to believe it's 59 but uh it's discernment of spirits and in that message brother branham is very very um adamant about explaining that it's not what a person believes he said i can put up with anything you know he said but it's according to what they live you know paraphrasing bringing down a whole message it's what they live he said you can have all the word and still miss it please but you can't have all the revealed word that makes it so now that puts it in a different category right so that not that's just what we'll try to do this afternoon so bear with me if i'm a little lengthy on it okay but now we we talked about justification just trying to back the front of her that we know and realize that no one can come to god according to john 6 44. see jesus said no man can come accept the father drawing all right then you'd say you know and i tried to emphasize and get the point across that you say well how do we know that god is drawing us well why are you concerned right that's right right something must be drawing us amen or we would not be concerned the devil is certainly not going to try to draw us sure he draws to his way but a point but see uh you know so then the bible does say we love it towards matthew 5 and 6. we're blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness one for they shall be filled the prophet said it's just it's a blessing to just be a have a hunger well can't you see then that what i was trying to explain that even a person who'd never heard of god but in the form of we talk about the lord jesus christ or our one god that he's he's worshipping a totem pole or something but he still he has that soul within him that longs out for to know about his creator well you know he's being drawn right because he goes to that form so then it's wonderful to think about how that god would call us and i wrote it like this why would we be concerned if god wasn't calling us i mean what would you be concerned about while you're in church what are you doing what's the point if you don't know whether god is calling you or not so then don't worry about whether he's calling you just make sure you follow the rest of the scripture to make your calling and election sure you just go on with the rest of the word we certainly didn't put the thirst our desire for god into our own sails because we have a thirst and a desire for the world all right for satan and his doing all right but now let's go on as we start into this second work and as i said i just quoted these that we we don't believe in three works of grace the prophet would say works that's fine as long as you understand what you're saying but it's not three works of grace it's three stages of the same god because it's not three gods it's justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost it's father son holy ghost all comes together to make one all right so then as we'll get to it this evening that will help you very a lot to remember that each one is a work of the holy spirit but it's the same holy spirit the prophet said the same holy spirit that justified the lutheran sanctified the messages baptized the pentecostal right all right same holy spirit it's just god in his ways of working his form of salvation to to bring it to that right all right so keep that in your mind now as we we start into the message because we certainly don't want to have one god of a justification and another one to sanctify us and then another one to fill us you know or something like that or trinitarian concept we want to hold together with the one true and the living god all right now so it's the holy spirit in us bringing forth the salvation that he wants us to have but we've got to accept that now that was the point i tried to to get across where you know people say oh it's not whether i accept him it's whether he accepts me well that's good we'll get to that this afternoon because when you get the baptism of the holy ghost it's truly when god accepts you all right so that will go in with that part but see then it's not to just say that we don't accept him because if you don't accept him he can't accept you you must believe in your heart confess with your mouth it's not that you get saved and then you believe in your heart you confess with your mouth you got to do that to be saved see we do have something to do with that part but the salvation is of god because he's doing the work and his goodness is what leads us to repentance and truly more to see that the sanctification then would be you know something working within us to try to bring us to a place that god could be pleased to dwell all right now we know that the disciples were justified and i know what the prophet would say even of the word that he says their potential but just remember it is justified they were justified by believing the reason he's calling justification and sanctification to the disciples now you know the disciples with him it's because the holy ghost had not been given right and the holy ghost could not be inside of them right working it it wasn't working upon them but not inside of them in their soul to you know the new birth wasn't in there jesus christ hadn't died all right so then we look at it that we they were believing unto right they were justified potentially sanctified potentially because they were believing on two all right and believing on two they were in good shape but just remember in that stage we can lose it too if we're just believing unto it if we haven't come to the place to be sealed in by the holy spirit we can lose that part what we call salvation we went through that but the disciples were justified by believing on the lord jesus christ believing that he was the one who had come to die in their place you know they maybe not understood what he was saying but yet they did believe him all right there was a lot of people believed in if you'll read matthew mark luke and john you'll find a lot of people believed right but yet they didn't go on that's right but the disciples went on with him because peter you know he said where can we go that's it man that's right he confessed him as being the christ the son of the living god all right and see that's what we do of our justification we repent of our sins we accept jesus christ as our savior we go forth confessing the work behavior done within us to save us you know confessing him to be the savior declaring him to be the christ the son of the living god all right and in doing that then we realize what has taken place remember peter it was told to him when he said our the christ in other words his confession it was told peter there in matthew uh 16 18 verse upon this rock i'll build my church upon the revelation of jesus christ all right so then remember when we started in justification that we were talking about he that cometh to god the scripture says must believe that god is not was history can prove he was i don't save you to say he was it's when you can say he is amen and when he comes to us to repent of our sins and condemns us that is a present tense condemning us that's right it's not that we do and that's why the prophet said i'm against alder calls in the basis of trying to force people to an altar or tell them your mother was a good christian you know if you you want to go to heaven with your daddy or you find me you need to be saved he said don't do that why because it's not a work of the holy spirit among the work of the holy spirit at repentance is a present tense god i hope you was catching that one i tried to bring it out you know of that god is even that justification even to get you to repent of your sins it brings a present tense god right into our presence so i i hope you would catch on to that and hang on all right we know then the disciples went on further than just believing because john 17 jesus said sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth in other words sanctify them cleanse them and how are they sanctified now remember it wasn't in john 1. that's when there's believing that's when there's repentance you know you understand the reason i'm saying john 1 ain't talking about the i'm talking about it's not in the first chapter of john it's in the 17th chapter that went on for a while before they came to a place that he would speak of sanctification because he knew what was in their lives all right so then when jesus spoke of it he was speaking of their journey in their salvation he said sanctify them through thy truth see they had heard the word from the lord jesus all right you say well well bro dale on sanctification and just you know i just quit smoking i quit dipping snuff i quit chewing i quit doing this that or the other that's not sanctification see that's what i'm saying that people don't understand it people call that sanctification whereas you quitting something being sanctification that'll be your righteousness if sanctification is a work of the holy spirit and that's what your prophet said it was so then it would be that i quit it would be that something happened to me to make me quit that's right not be quitting yes that's why the prophet will go on to say you know that even drinking gambling smoke not said that's not sin then we get all confused with those statements but sanctification is not just because you quit something it's when the unclean spirit goes out that's right all right see that would be dealing then with something on the interior now watch what i'm saying listen justification is just a repentance from an honest heart the prophet said does nothing to the future in the future home we read the other day but sanctification is not just driving out the unclean spirit out of your spirit now listen the unclean spirit is coming out of the soul amen we certainly need it out of our spirit but all that happened to the soul of the individual justification was just chopping off the things they had done erasing them all right but sanctification starts dealing with a point and i'll repeat these as we go along but it's like brother around says the future home he said jesus you know dropped his blood upon this earth to cleanse and claim it and remember your body was right in there that's right so your body's already cleaned it was in the earth he'd done that all right but see claiming it not to just wash it did reclaim it he claimed his earth by dropping his blood on him all right our bodies as i said was in there but what he was claiming was the soul of man in doing that the disciples had come through justification by believing on the lord jesus christ and they had become sanctified according to saint john 17 by the hearing of the word or the washing of the word they heard the word they come to a place like i said peter said where can we go you know we can't go back to fishing we could do that they tried it but it didn't work after the death of jesus christ but he said where can we go in other words what church can we go to where can we find a place that'll help us so we can't do it no we just stay with you we don't understand but we just stay with you all right see what was happening the word get it and we'll get more into sanctification the word that is planted into your soul the prophet of god we gave one daughter the other day where said he said you're begotten like a baby in the wound of a mother begotten see that's what happens at sanctification that unclean spirit as jesus said goes out it's driven out by the planting of the word all right now see if we take these and if we went on to greater depth then you know where we would be going is that brother brown said that there was a mysterious part about justification sanctification of baptism with the holy ghost under the seals so we'd be going on dealing with you and i right now what do you mean brother i strike about a long time ago but that unclean spirit keeps trying to come back i said a born-again believer it keeps trying to come back on you and i just keep trying to take us back into the things that we've done so we have to keep on dying daily as paul said to ourselves just because we're born again don't give you a right to just sit down and say well no matter what i do no you're more concerned about what you do after you're born again than you are before you're born again amen all right but see sanctification it's like the prophet said you pick up a glass out of the yard you see that's justification you've got a reason for it he said you don't take in the house put water in it he said you sanctified you scald it you cleanse it we said that's still not in service now he said it's just washed the vessel to get it clean all right so now when we repented of our sins that's what most people think though they come to an altar and they repent of their sins and they feel good because they're repentant well they think it's all finished that's good baptism man i got it when i believe you know well where in the message do you hear people preach that you must be justified sanctified to be able to be filled with the baptism in the holy ghost they've got forgotten all about that they're so great so mysterious mysteries are the great things and how can you preach the mysteries if you don't understand the simplicity right you know i'm not i'm just honest i try to say things to get you to think about your salvation see what happened to you then you might find out what happened to you wouldn't enough right that's right because that justification you get rid of a load of sin makes you feel good you go to church you get baptized you start reading your bible but what's happening that word then starts driving out that unclean spirit oh i just want you pray for me brother dale and this this i know this they don't go across good to the people of the message that go ahead you out there on the internet you just remember oh brother dale's crazy but i always have believed when i heard the prophet and i told you about it that i never did say i was had the baptism in the holy ghost because i came in the message you know i was addicted at 23 years old in the church honored by the people because of my ability to teach and do things but yet when i saw what he was talking about the baptism in the holy ghost i knew i didn't have it i believe i was living a sanctified clean life but i didn't have the baptism with holy ghost well see i won't know what the baptism of the holy ghost was there so i started reading all i could read that the prophet was telling it you know then i found out what he was talking about justification and i thought well that's good now let me walk back even though i've been walking maybe that line or repentance of my sins but i hadn't been baptized correctly so that was one point but god went through their ignorance someone was baptized wrong but then when we heard the truth we got baptized and named the lord jesus christ all right see and then when we did we started repenting not just that time you know you know not just repent of your sins and he don't repent no more i mean i hope that didn't happen to anybody i mean it should be a daily repentance but we don't have to repent for what we've done two times you know what i'm saying repenting for what we was and was born that away have done fine that's why the prophet said you don't repent for what adam done well see adam what adam them done made us the way we are it looks like he's telling us something wrong doesn't it but he said you don't have to repent for what adam done he says what you've done right well then you find out as i was trying to bring that it wasn't a spirit that killed jesus is my sins he hung on the cross for me well then why wouldn't we want to keep repenting and saying lord forgive me help me and lead me all right and it wouldn't matter how close you got to god you'd still be doing that right brother prairie greens at that time right around and told him said brother prairie he said when you feel god close to you he said just tell him that brother brown loves you he meant it he loved it and he wanted him he wanted everybody to tell him you know all right will you follow me justification is god working on me and you and then we keep repenting all right then we start hearing the word but but now brother dale what i don't understand about you is that you seem to put the new birth over a period of time well now i thought that it took three and a half years to get the disciples to the places they could receive the holy ghost right that's great all right you know that's what i thought now i'm mistaken there you tell me about it right but now then i i've tried to explain if brother gary was here he's listening he'll say amen because you know we used to talk about it he wanted the baptism in the holy ghost and i said brother gary you're going at it wrong i said just forget about trying to receive something just forget about now didn't mean what to do i said just go on with the lord and just keep praying and seeking god and reading the word and studying and i said one day he'll cross your path right yeah and one day he called me from going well used to call it the the greatest battle ever fault because it was out of the ride to alabama where he was going over there hauling uh films backers and fourth you know and we call it the battle of i-20 and so one day he called me from the rest area and he said brother dale's over that's okay i told you but you see everybody wants to come up one time and thank god i believe god can do it i believe he can give you the baptism of the holy ghost i can prove that by the bible because the three thousand only heard one sermon and received the baptism in the holy ghost so they had to go through justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost in that sermon they heard but still remember it could not come until they heard the word that's right all right well then it may happen to you that way you may have come to the altar went through all three right there at the altar and receive the baptism of the holy ghost i'm not going to say you didn't i'm going to say amen because he will prove whether we got the holy ghost tonight about what we do and how we follow the word so you know that's no problem but i'm going to tell you on the average percentage there's going to be a whole lot more because of one reason and i'm sorry to have to say it this way but that's the best way to say it because most of the churches don't preach you need to be justified you need to be sanctified and you need the baptism of the holy ghost they don't preach it that way they just preach you believe the prophet and by not doing that the people don't go through the stages they don't go through those stages of seeking after god why not not seek after gone every day i thought i i i don't understand that but you see if you don't know what happened so just go through the stages with me as we're talking on the people on the internet or you here or whatever if you think you're not born again just listen to see where you can find where you're at then when you find where you're at you can do something about it that's right right cause we'll try to instruct on further as we go and talk about it see all right so we repent of our sins we get forgiven we go to church we get baptized looks like a good christian though and that's wonderful and we're going to get this afternoon where the prophet made the statement he said sure he said you're believing and he even says you have eternal life he said you just repented your new birth has just begun that's what he says he says if you die right now sure you're going to heaven i explained that the other night i believe that but i believe you're going to have to go there as a foolish virgin or something we'll get to those points as we go along but still forget there you get time all right but see sanctification then is is to cleanse and set aside and it's washing out but it's not just washing out are you listening that's why it's not just quitting things that's right it's cleansed and you know sanctified washed and cleansed something happened it's a compound word cleansed and set aside see it's a whole lot deeper than just repentance of your sins well that deeper point than just going to church and being baptized is to go on in a life to work that you can say god is dealing with me to bring me to that place we see sanctification is us hearing and acting upon the word right that's what the disciples done they heard the word for three and a half years they listened daily all right then jesus in matthew 12 43 he said the unclean spirit is gone out of a man that he walketh in dry places seek us rest find us none say you'll come back to the house if it's not filled paraphrasing amen he said it'll come back in right all right now the prophet said that's the most dangerous stage right sanctification is a dangerous point more dangerous of a stage than justification because you you just repented at justification you start trying to do good but at sanctification you get more concern about your life and your doings and then you quit cutting your hair you you you you quit painting your face you know you you and they cut their hair off and and and they start acting right doing right you know all right see then that's the dangerous stage because there's where that unclean spirit will come back now if you need these i'll be glad to give you anybody on the internet you should know if you know the message the prophet said a lot of times that devil comes back he said he don't make you go back to the bars see something doesn't happen to you you don't make you go back to smoking and drinking something's happened he said but he'll put you in church that's why he said if you need these i'll be glad to find him because i've been preaching this for 40 something years and he said he'll put you in a church and you'll start doing things in the church even become a deacon i did see start living a good clean life being conscious of the wrong in the things that's right and he said it's because of that unclean spirits come back because see we think of the devil we always think of the devil as a two-horned guy in the pitchfork and the the dirty bars and the the messed up places literally said he ain't there you know where he's at this morning i'm glad there ain't nobody on front view we were wrong about and i admit he's a little closer than that amen he's up you're telling me right now that you don't want to hear this and that you've heard it so many times the weird that's just old hashed over stuff well he's a whole lot closer than that front view then because he's still talking to us he said well you're not there will he talk to the lord jesus all right talking to us ain't no problem it's just yielding to it you know a lot of times i admit i yield to it and it was like brother donny said we went outside like our wednesday night and i i kind of you know i didn't go too long we went outside and about nine o'clock we got through the whole song service or something he said you could preach 45 more minutes because people stayed 45 more minutes that's right well you know then i've condemned for going too long and i'm condemned because i've been long enough you ain't gonna win over him so don't worry about it just just forget it with that old root of evil now like i said if it goes out and it'll come back it can be a religious demon okay a religious demon wants to go to church wants to study the message wants to know all the prophets said real quick to condemn you about something about the prophet what he's saying become legalistic that reminds you of a lot of preachers that all they preach is hiring clothes and shoes and doing some you know and i agree with every bit of that i agree that it's right that's right because i've said to you over and over if we live like the devil we've got the devil living in us so that solves the problem that's reason you don't hear brother dale preaching every week about hiring dress and clothes because you didn't hear jesus preaching about it and you're going to bible show me he was against every bit of it but that wasn't the way he preached it when your prophet came it sounds like he's so hard and hammering would you listen to him he says you can do every bit of that still die and go to hell he knew what it was to be sanctified he knew what it was to have the unclean spirit driven out of it how many people understand how many people have been sanctified and had it driven out but be careful because it can come back and when it comes back it comes back religious and that's the danger you say oh no i know whether it's god or the devil now you you're sure right in the middle of the devil's trap he said the devil when he talked to me he said he talked meaning rough he said when god talks to me sweet noble now you got it right in reverse that's right i'm going to tell you you got it in reverse right because god generally speaks heart and stern get behind me satan was that what he said to peter he didn't say peter now you love him sleep with the little guy would you mind walking back over and get him over out of the way no he said get behind me and the devil he's real sweet that's enough to let you know who's talking to you that's right it's not always you know the bad things and the good things so just take it for the word that's why i love to talk about sanctification because that's what i'm trying to do in you and i in the higher stages is to to those that are born again is to preach sanctification like brother brown did under the sixth seal that there'd be such a cleansing that god can come on the scene all right soul cleansed and set aside until god can come on the scene in our hearts and our lives all right but now you listen everything we get go ahead brother anderson pull up number one but we'll start remember how we brought it to justification that all you get from god must come by faith a revelation need to be revealed to you something from god that's why it is god in us doing it so look what the prophet of god says about this root of evil now he's tying and i hope you'll listen in a minute when we get one especially if i can remember he'll tie the ages and the church together because he always does because that's why it was so amazing to me when i first heard brother branham preaching and i heard him because i knew a little bit about the doctrines not much but i knew at least about what the lutheran believed a little what the methodists believe the presbyterian the bad discs the things and even a little about the pentecostals and things you know and as i began to listen to him he would talk and he would talk about luther anytime he would speak about justification he speaks of luther well you know what i knew that that was at least a move of god but it proved out to be true and i believe the just shall live by faith don't you see so then justification would be laid up on faith so listen what he's saying then after martin luther preaching justification john wesley come along preaching saints again he preached that a man after being justified now that's where most people take the ages and they just bring it down to lump things in the first work that we would the first stage was justification under martin luther now wesley believed what martin luther preached wesley was preaching justification come on go study history wesley was preaching justification he came to america to convert the heathen he ran into the more ravens or how you pronounce the name and they were actually the ones that taught him or showed him the message of sanctification and then when god began to deal with him he went back home and he said lord i went there to convert the heathen and found out i needed to be converted it wasn't that he needed to be justified he needed to step into the next stage of god's word which was sanctification all right see you've got to believe in justification wesley believed in that and god gave him sanctification the pentecost i'm talking about the truth now i'm not talking about the junks all right i'm going to talk about everybody claims i'll show you i've got a quote but brother said a lot of people believe justified he said they didn't get it a lot of people believed sanctification they didn't get it he said a lot of people believed the baptism in the holy ghost and they didn't get it but see john wesley accepted what luther had taught and then god added more to it of the the stage of sanctification so look at it john wesley come on preaching sanctification and he preached that a man after being justified it's all right but you've got to be sanctified cleansed the root of evil taken out of you by the blood of jesus now you can't expect the lutherans to preach sanctification because they're not going to do it right he goes on down and showing that the others won't do it this won't do it but listen wesley he may have not preached it from matthew on called it the unclean spirit going out of the land but when brother brown describes his message he describes his message as the unclean spirit or the enemy going out because that's what sanctification is is god working and working us to drive out that unclean spirit all right so then watch what it's talking about and i said that's what so thrilled me because i knew a little about the doctrine you know when brother rather would say that well it is right that you lutheran's preached justification and i knew there was a lot of other things in between but and the message is free sanctification and then i knew that there was like a um some coming in there you know people from holiness etc i knew a little bit about those that you know came in right in between just before you get to the pentecostal and i knew the pentecostals preached the baptism of the holy ghost it's what they called it speaking in tongues but that wasn't everybody there were good people there it was a move of god you agree it was god bringing his word to pass all right but see then that way i could see the agent of the way you never heard nobody talk about that i can see what the new birth is brother ronald said the last three ages completed the verb justification sanctification the baptism in the holy ghost the birth they didn't say the birth was done it just brought you to a birth all right but now follow what we're talking about look at the next one the future home where brother brown talks about sanctification all right and when you ask you're forgiving your sins you're only done this taking that away so that's justification he had lines in there representing sin and things so we evidently raised it out all right and watch but the thing that made you do it is still there do you think that's something you come to the altar you repent you come to church you start you get baptized you start to and the prophet of god says that the devil is still in there bless god without you can't tell me and when i got saved i got saved well what you upset about i mean you've proven that you didn't get it on the action you remember the two brought around running to the one that it was running around with the woman you know and he heard one speaking tongues and the other interprets you know one of me talked to him the guy said you spoke in tongues he said no searcher and he said you ain't got it you talk to the other one he said well just go ahead you don't try to believe you're going but you know he wasn't all dogmatic like the other one you see somebody dogmatic you got a problem all right but now look what he goes on to say it's the old root of evil it's still there notice then you repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ that he forgave you of your sin notice then secondly comes sanctification which sets our mind in order for holiness now hold on to these words mind in order mine not brain that's right brain is where it comes through all right wonderful mind mind what paul talks about is the mind that was in christ be in you he's not talking about the brain all right so keep that in your thoughts secondly on sanctifications which sets our mind in order for holiness to think right taken away sanctification is a compound greek word which means cleaned and set aside for service sanctification i said a minute ago in just one word it's two words cleansed and set aside let me use it this way we'll get back on the way i'm gonna get this morning but you probably want to hear that message on the new birthday season i still be on sanctification but set your mind in order now get what i said not your brain in order it should come in order by the inside working so sanctification begins to work in the soul of man around draw the heart and then our heart he had a snake and then that heart he had alliance which represented sin future home really now he draws two hearts i've told you you know you can say what you want to i believe he was emphasizing the same heart but what was the reason because he never took out the unclean spirit and he never took the sin out and then put a dove in he showed one with the dove and one with the unclean spirit and the sin all right so it sets your mind justification is the forgiving of the sins of the soul because that's why the bible said the soul of synthesis will die now then that soul begins to be cleansed by the opening of the word are there the reading of the word to study in the word how many of you was like i was that when i first got converted i thought if i'm going to be a christian i need to know what the bible says i mean that was my point i need to know what the bible says right so i set out to read the bible right well because i was going to be a christian i was supposed to know what it said all right but see then sanctification starts dealing with that inward part of us called the soul to cleanse and claim it that's right and set our mind in order for holiness set the soul in line for god to be able to deal with it and to be able to bring us to that place now go to the third one on the message how can i overcome brother brown calls it says the enemy now so we want to know what the enemy is talking about satan the root of evil satan what happened then when the enemy that went out under sanctification that was washed out returned back and found the house not filled with the holy ghost now the state of the church is joined with the with the league of the churches with the world council of churches and he's explaining what if you want me to be playing he's explaining that that's what happened to the church world when luther refused now you'll hear brother and make these statements so you know that i'm saying it right he said refu to refuse to take this the fundament of the word now you know he's not talking about martin luther he's talking about the lutheran luther was a man of god he he he done the best he could do but the lutheran couldn't do and what happened when the westminster regular where you can follow it when the wesleyan come along the methodists and the unclean spirit went out see those that didn't go on with god waiting on the father of the opening of the word what happened the unclean spirit came back just like it comes back into the soul of an individual he came back in the church then you go over to a good match at this church i'm not talking about where my brother goes if they were bikinis on the beach i'm talking about a good mess at this church you'll find i'm preaching some good times and living some good things i come up to them thing i'm 72 years old see i come up when people were trying to live right now there's still people out there trying to live right now but what's wrong with them why won't they accept what you've got i'm just honest now i'm not throwing off on nobody why don't they just say well what you're saying is right because it's so simple that you present it till it looks like it's the truth right and they say i can't see that i don't believe the bible says that they'll even tell you that way you know and i mean you get this lord right there well that's paul we don't agree with paul we who we there's good people out there but they're caught by the system yes of the church let me said i'm not against people he said i'm against the system the thing that made the people be like they are right you some of your parents has turned against you some of your brothers and sisters maybe even you know your mothers and fathers has turned against you because of what you believe why why is it you know when you're simply trying to explain them to them about jesus christ right that's right but while they turned against you because see that unclean spirit had already come back into that system and it's in the in it's got to be an individual people to be in a system because you know it takes individuals to make a church system okay everybody understand me so it's not just a system of something right on the front of a building right it's spirits and and lives but just think about it that unclean spirit that enemy the devil and those people are good they go to church they worship you go right over here i'm not throwing up on nobody right you go right over here they're worshiping one witness right right you go out and you you go to churches and they're doing more worship well and see if it's all on the basis of just worse them what is it let's see how the unclean spirit has come back all right that's why we had to be born again you know we had to be born again to come out of the church are you following me to come out of the church you think i don't love my people that's in the methodist and badness and stuff like that you think i wouldn't do anything in the world i could to help it's just that way all right but he puts it with the ages go to number four so this is also how can i overcome this paragraph after paragraph 48 we use this program 47 because of what i wanted you'd look at the ages and the systems and we'll notice when the unclean spirit is gone from a man who walks in dry places that's exactly what the church has done methodist baptist methodist those who believe in sanctification then jesus said the unclean spirit that went out returned back to this church body and finds the house garnished and swept clean living pure clean lives all right but then if that house isn't filled or occupied see that's the dangerous part you can see it in the ages that have come down you can see it in the churches why they don't accept what you're saying i mean all you gotta do is just read two of mine amen why is it that you and we were the same way right when they first presented water baptism i mean it plainly said black white right repeat that one and be baptized in the name of jesus christ right there in the scripture but see the unclean spirit had put into us father son and holy ghost and listen to brother brown when he was talking about over in africa or somewhere where they were having a meeting this storm was coming up and he said then which doctor sitting there using the three high names he said father son and holy ghost father son and holy god the brain that's how they make them work all right the unclean spirit goes out of man cleanse is set aside for service go on down let's read a couple we'll just stick with this and i'll try to cut it off if i can firstly continue for the faith look what the prophet had to say the first thing you pick it up names explaining just case i'm testing back to you from home ago to somebody that on the internet system that don't have these then you'll see the prophet was saying from the message earnestly continued for the faith 1954 404 morning service the first thing you pick it up this justification you got in your hand you got it in your hand you can't use it yet it needs to be cleansed then you take it in you wash it sterilize it boil it take all the germs and and the out of it that's what god does through sanctification takes the desire of sin out of your heart now hold that point because what you hear most people preach is the baptism of the holy ghost takes the desire of sin out of your heart and you'll hear brother brown say that but now here he says sanctification sure the baptism of the holy ghost takes out things sure it does brother around said this thing is still left in this because it takes a holy ghost and fire right that's future home if you read the book but look what he's saying you can boil it sterilize it turn up that's what god does through just sanctification takes all the desire of sin out cleanse you up then you're a candidate for the feeling of the holy spirit then the word sanctify means to be cleansed and set aside for service that's the old testament the altar sanctified the vessels and cleanse and set aside for service so we've tied it together old and new look at the next one this is questions and answers law having a shadow all right listen the blood of jesus christ cleanses you from lust and passion called sanctification the word sanctification means to be cleansed and suicide for service you get what um now that lush spirit leaves you under sanctification the little lady nice goes to church she sings in the choir she has to mow her grass with a little pair of shorts on let her get sanctified one time and let her put on the fire man you've heard around say that there ain't no way your holy ghost feel warm because on pair of pants stuff like that never listen look see let the man let that man that'll almost have a wreck looking at that woman in the yard and let him get sanctified one time and go down the street he'll keep his mind on what he's doing that's exactly right if he gazes sideward sideways he'll turn his head this way the holy spirit says turn your head there's so much sanctification he says the holy spirit tells the man to turn his head come on that's it there you are that's right that's sanctification the unclean spirit going out of a man you see most people preach the baptism in the holy ghost is where it goes out that's not the way your prophet taught it it goes out at sanctification lust and desires i can stand here today and tell you i know that's true because i've told you that i came in this message and i knew i did not have the baptism of the holy ghost when the prophet began to talk about it but i lived a good life under sanctification and those problems i had went away why because i prayed and i asked god to cleanse me and i repented every day and i still repent every day and that's god to help me cleanse me lord sanctify me because it all just keeps climbing higher and higher and higher he said well i have no problems well pray for me all right i'm just honest that's the way i mean it not sarcastic i mean it right pray for me because i need it but the unclean spirit goes out and supposed to take out all them desires and things well i believe i'm sanctified but i still just can't help it i still do this at the other well you might already consider to not sanctified i don't know we're good i know but not or to consider it brother that i believe the prophet's message and i believe that well that's wonderful now the devil does too does that save him right now i'm going to explain something that i've seen all my life since i did see the prophet's message about these things that unclean spirit going out that unclean spirit comes back in he's a religious demon right and being a religious demon he wants to go to church he don't want to go to the honky tonks he wants to go to church he loves worship and music can do it he wants to fellowship and talk about the word because it's part of him you know he's thinking that away we think of the devil being so mean to everything see we blame everything on him don't let me everything on the devil it's not all that bad anyway he's so close if you're going to compare judas and jesus if you would back there without the new birth you'd say judas was a better guy until you get down maybe the end you know all right but you know he was the treasurer he was just that or the other jesus was out there beating them whips running out of temple you see that unclean spirit they don't want to go to hell why does he want to get in you because he thinks if he can get into you he's going where you're going that's right think on that because i've seen that for a long time he don't want to go to hell you don't want to be destroyed sure he wants to take over but it's like i've tried to explain it to you and i know i get in trouble when i try to explain things but see satan don't want to do away with god he wants to get all the people of god on his side and if he could do that it would automatically bring god under subjection to him he's not going to destroy god he just can't understand i ain't why he's not the right hand man anymore right see satan is very very religious now when we get on to the doctrines that we ever do get there other things we don't agree with i hope you remember this that what causes a man to go into a doctrine two souls seventh under virtue peruse et cetera river jordan's considered doctrine it cannot be the holy spirit because the holy spirit doesn't teach era but you know brother brown said that the holy spirit and the devil is so close he said till the devil can even pass out supernatural gifts you say yeah but brother dave you're scaring me today good that means you know you need to do something about it right if i'm scaring you the way i preach you know then you need to do something about your experience and don't ever be satisfied until you get the answer from god just don't do it but listen he said that woman she goes out there she goes to church she does it she comes home she goes and cuts her grass gotta put on her little shorts why i've always been plain and blunt sorry i've always said anything that's advertised is for sale right he said no that woman is a pure she wouldn't do nothing it's for sale you just got to make the price we was coming up the road one morning years ago from work and they had this talk show on and these people were streaking and they they were asking calling people and asking would you strict would you you know would you run down the street with your clothes off strict where the people come somebody received money you're going naked in other words you run down the road naked would you do that no this one lady they said would you do that no 100 no 500 no thousand dollars no 10 000 well he just hit her price that was the thing and that's what i'm saying about all of us if we're not truly born again christians we got a price so we better find out and get to pray better find out if we are these christians that we talk about because sanctification is the holy spirit working upon the soul of man working out through his spirit out through his spirit to bring his body under subjection now how many times you heard me tell that the holy ghost is inside of you in your soul working out through your spirit to bring your body under control right is that not true what god does yes he works from the inside outwardly to control the unclean spirit comes in works right back out the same way that's right stand the two up right now you're gonna see the difference right oh one of them blaze the prophet no you'll find out most of them is it's in the wrong ranks will tell you they believe the prophet that's right brother brown said let me run through this in a hurry and i can go on this in brother brown says on the future home you don't have to pull them up brother he said that sanctification paragraph 95 96 97 98 future home says cleanse that desire out of him because he's claimed it now somewhere on there you'll find it you can read and you'll see that he's talking about claiming that soul claiming it may not be the exact quote but then you go on down to paragraph 103 104 105 of the same future home you talk about claiming it see claiming it claiming your soul the unfeeling spirit is driven out and god claims it you get over the paragraph 108 and 109 he's talking about abraham and how that when he was offered the fact of burying it his wife remember the man was so wonderful too and he said i'll give you the place bury your wife look like abraham's sarcastic old coat he's annoying by it run around with looking like nights at all with them prophets top christ he said because abraham if he'd allowed him to pay it he said satan could come alone and if jesus didn't go to the cross and pay the price he said satan could come along and lay claim lay a claim on to you me all right i'll abide he says jesus had to purchase it all right then it's all odd thing i'm gonna have time to get there bro let's make the statement it's an odd thing when you get over so you put up the lights with number 10. when you get over to the seals and the prophet is talking about the plan of redemption right and look what he's talking about then the next mystery was wrapped up around that one inheritance was and stuck out here on this side the climb to so-and-so and went on down until it made a scroll because people didn't have books like this then it was a row how many of them that caught a scroll well a seal scroll you know what you could break loose out here what the mystery of this was and turn it loose and you can see what the claim was that's why everybody preaches basically the seals is the the revealing the antichrist i differ with you 100 you reveal jesus christ you can automatically see the antichrist right away amen it's the revealing of jesus christ i thought the whole bible was a revelation of jesus christ look at sanctification cleansing and claiming it look under the sixth seal how that he talks about this world and how it's going to go through a process of burning over and things to cleanse it why because his blood's already dropped on it to claim it look at you and i cleanse and claim that's what happens at sanctification that unclean spirit goes out and the holy holy spirit in the form of that word comes within your soul and begins to build like a baby in the mother's womb the body is completely formed before the baby comes from the wound that's why the prophet when i was looking at those things he said see all the elements that came out of jesus's body water came out blood came out the holy spirit came out to come and live in you and i go to the seals and then you find him talking about sanctification the mysterious part he says with justification saint peter's the bad people i want to go he gets over to the seventh seal as i quoted to you the other day and he said now when all this comes up he said don't try to figure it out he said go on with the same simple message because if you don't you'll warm yourself away from it still preaching justification sanctification and baptism in the holy ghost when he got over 64 preaching the future home he said if you don't get nothing get the plan of salvation because the world goes through the same as we go through the church ages went through what we went through if you followed me luke there's justification wesley saint gates pentecostal baptism ain't not wonderful but you and i have to do that to be able to come to have the new world we must go through those stages well i just got all going to believe that's good baptist well i went through it all at one time okay then don't get scared when i say time don't get shook up when i say that most people don't because i'm not saying you didn't i'm just saying i didn't and i'm explaining my new birth but we don't have to all come the way you do you gotta come the way i did maybe not exactly the type of journey but you've got to come through justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost if you come up here right now and go through it at one time you still got to go through it we proved that with the 3 000. they went through it but three 120 a half years before they were ready why because when they got it look they went into 120 wouldn't the 3000 was born again right here but 120 was born again right here with all this just didn't know this time so they had to have a new birth sanctification cleanse and set aside come on brothers clean and set aside for service well i pray that the lord would come into me and take all of my desires out that's good but why don't you just say lord just take them out if you're sanctifying me because we just found out the prophet said that's when the things goes out of us what can we still be tempted yes well difference in temptation is sin though you can be tempted but just don't yield yourself to the temptation right man because it'll turn out to be the wrong thing right let's stand together let's put a bunch of it before we can get to it for more i want to talk about we'll review so much this afternoon but listen sanctification is a very dangerous position because you think you're saved you get a new desire right if the unclean spirit goes out and the old desires goes out you get a new desire to serve god this is this sanctification you're getting your desire you want to do right you want to live right you want to go to church you want to believe you want to dress right in that right but that don't mean you're born again that's right it's been all right back wesley's day but this is another day that's why they can't understand brother branham and i think he talked to new birth different they can't understand that he's having to preach the ages what if brother brown i'll give you this when we start to make you think a little what if brother brown said the the the new birth is just a baptism the holy ghost like people are saying he said what if he said that you know that would mean that i can prove luther never had it wesley didn't have it pentecost didn't have it so i've run into that doctrine too and a man come right here i sit right down here in in gillsville at a supper we had and told him that brother branham would talk different on what he was saying he came right here and said that luther and wesley and pentecost didn't have nothing i had set right down there an hour so before then he said it and i just made a roundabout way talking about we wrote around and said that they had the baptism of the holy ghost they had a new word even he called it the new birth of sanctification he come right on up here and preaching you know why cause he couldn't preach error you know what people believed him didn't believe he brought around i'm sorry i just try to believe what it says and if you had it only as justification then you would only have the water coming out of jesus's body if you had sanctification all you got to do then you would only have the blood to come out of jesus body but to have the new birth there's got to be a life come out of that body that would be able to come back into you and i 539 anybody have a need uh they never had back trouble my me thank you oh me oh within me me within me oh is unto me foreign within me oh storm
