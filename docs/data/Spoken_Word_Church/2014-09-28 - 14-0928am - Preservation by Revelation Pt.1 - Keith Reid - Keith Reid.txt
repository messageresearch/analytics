seen for a long time amen god bless you sir amen and so we certainly appreciate you just trust that the word of god because that's what brought us together the word of god amen had it not built for the word of god and the revelation we have in this day we would not have known each other amen but we thank god that he has sent us a word in this day and he said he said his word to heal us amen praise god so this morning we want to look at the word we want to go to the book of genesis chapter 41 and we we want to take a look in the the life of joseph this morning and then after uh we're going to the book of revelation chapter 3 so we first read from genesis uh 41 i'm going to read from verse 33 just trust god the word of god would be a blessing to you this morning because one thing we want to do you know brother branham preached modern events made clear by the prophecies that we have we we certainly want to go to the world and we want to look at the day that we're living in and to see how these things that were said that are there in the scripture and to look at the time so we can know the spiritual clock that god has exactly where we are let us just bow with our heads as we find it our gracious god and our father lord we know god the greatest prophet said that a man could do is get himself out of the way and lord god we pray this morning the lord god our personality doesn't stand before you lord our person oh god don't come before you this morning but lord god may you as you promised be glorified behind skin this morning lord we said if you would send the anointing to speak o god to your children because lord god our backgrounds are different the things we go to are different but we've got one thing in common this morning god and lord you are that oh personal god that stand before us this morning lord you know every heart you never don't fall let god you know every victory and lord god we pray that you'll be manifested and glorified oh god behind our skins this morning the lord god he who speak and he will hear would become one in your god the lord jesus we can hear your word and and see you manifested in flesh as we look at the things that we go through in this day oh god bless us we pray and bring all things to our remembrance as we speak o god bless your children and father we pray that you you give the back to them in abundance oh god to what they have given to us god and lord god may your fellowship be sweet together lord god may the love of the brother would continue god while we're on this side of glory the lord god nothing will be done through pride or or vain glory but lord god may we lift you up oh god in all our doing the lord god you'll be well pleased with our lives bless us now as we look to you and believe you in jesus name we pray amen and amen and so we read from verse 33 i just want to pick a portion that we read because we're going to follow just a little bit now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and send him over the land of egypt let pharaoh do this and let him appoint officers over the land and take up the the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seventh plenteous years and let them together all the food of those good years that come and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh and let them keep food in the cities and that food shall be for store in the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of egypt that the land perished not through the famine and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servant and pharaoh said unto his servant can we find such a one as this is a man in whom the spirit of god is and pharaoh said unto joseph for as much as god as show thee all this god now pharaoh an unbeliever believing that god has shown this to joseph there is none so discreet and wise as there are thou shall be over my house and according unto thy word shall all my people be rule only in the throne will i be greater than thou is now at the right hand of pharaoh amen hallelujah and pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set thee over all the land of egypt then over in revelation chapter 3 and i read verse 7 then i go to verse 10 and to the end revelation chapter 3 the philadelphia church age and to the angel of the church of philadelphia write these things said he that is holy he that is true and he that have the key of david either open a no man shot and shot and no man open verse 10 because that was kept the word of my patience i will keep thee from the hour of temptation that hour that joseph would tell pharaoh that's going to come i will keep thee through that hour amen which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth they will i come quickly hold fast that which thou has that no man take thy crown right him that overcometh will i make a pillow in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which come down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name he that athen here let him hear what the spirit says the churches may the lord add his blessing to the word you may be seated we certainly want to thank god for the word that has been preserved for us we thank him for the written word and yet we thank him for the word that has been revealed in this day that we're living in amy we want to thank god for the the modern events of our day we want to thank god that we can look in the pages of the word and we can see these things coming to pass that was spoken even before to us really then we know that the word of god is the truth i mean we know that god was mindful of us even before we come to a place like this amen that there is therefore to the bride there's nothing new to us i mean but god was mindful of us he was mindful of our placing i mean god was mindful of the things that we see you know we see the the economy is changing we see other things happening out there in the world and god is mindful of everything that we go through this morning i'd like to speak you know on preservation through revelation amen we we saw that in the the life of david and and one thing we want i want to lay a foundation on we find that the book of genesis parallels the book of revelation and and there so therefore we can say that that the law of genesis is a law of revelation what was there in genesis it was really repeated in the book of revelation for us really and so that genesis becomes not just history it becomes not just the story of the bible but it becomes that which god did hallelujah and and then in the book of revelation now we pick these things for our day and we look at what happened in genesis and we know exactly what the outcome would be is that right so so we we know that in genesis there were seven church ages in revelation there were seven church ages you know jesus uh there in matthew you look at the seven seals uh i mean there in revelation there were seven seals is that right we find in genesis we find adam and eve in the garden of eden amen there in revelation we find the bride and christ in the kingdom age of god is that right amen so we find there in genesis we find an enoch is that right and enough walk with god in the revelation we can pick out now an enoch that will walk with god is that right amen we find in genesis there was an eleazar amen in this day we find also an eleazar that has come to us amen that has called us out from where we are and we know that we're going on to our isaac amen and we find there in genesis that there was a a civilization and it might be you know way just more like this one that we're in now there was a great scientifical scientific civilization whereby they built the pyramids and all of that and we find now we're moving from the scientific civilization and we're moving now into a civilization of fate by the word of god for all day hallelujah amen so we can see the parallels that there is in the word of god we see exactly what god wanted to do and how god did it and we see god fulfilling his word to us really no no joseph his life was a life of god bringing him to a placing and so we find there in the word of god that when god called him and the first thing that god does is give him the revelation of his placing you you know joseph he his father gave him a court of many colors and and by this that he was given him and then you know he started to have dreams and visions aiming by by this process of his life that he was going through and so he had two dreams and he began to tell his brethren about his dream you know and they said what are you trying to say that you're going to rule over us and he had a dream and he tell us to his father and his father said come on joseph what are you trying to say are you saying that your your mother and i are going to bow down to you you see joseph could get further than that he was merely saying what god had showed to him and and that's right and to them it seems far-fetched it's because of the sons though his father loved him to his brethren he was the least among them but god was with him is it right hallelujah so you know we find that the dreams what what dreams of his place in god was showing him is placing there in those dreams and if you watch the way that god does this thing when samuel anoint david he said to him you're going to be king the anointing brings the placing is that right amen when elijah amen you pass that robe over to elijah he said a double portion of what is on me it's gonna come upon you it's placing he knows exactly what he's gonna do when when god called out abraham he said i'm gonna make you the father of a nation he knows exactly what it's going to be and brother branham you see there in the ministry when god called him out he said if you would get the people to believe you hello nothing is going to stand before your pearls you know brother branham said in the message as i was with moses he said i was to be brought forth he said because when god said that i say they won't believe me and he said because of that i will give you two signs is that right but but he said he comes later he said listen i haven't come past this mountain long enough it's not in the signs it's in the commission amen hallelujah and he said if i if he kept his eyes on the sign he missed the commission and so you know he had to make a turn because he had to go back him into the commission that god had given to him so we find then that even when we look at the pyramid fate is a revelation is that right and fate is a revelation of the capstone once you get into faith i mean that anointing amen that shows you the cat coming down upon the mountain so god is showing you exactly where he's going to take you you know exactly where you're going to go you you don't have to through the trials of life wonder because god said exactly what god means is that right amen so we know exactly what god is doing hallelujah amen we know exactly where god is going to bring bring us hallelujah so we're not wondering hey is god's going to do it no i mean if god brings you to it god's going to bring you through it amen hallelujah amen so as a message believers this morning amen we know exactly what god is doing amen we know exactly what god is bringing us through everything that we've got need of is right there in that message amen we can look at the pages of the word and the message even the bible becomes a new book we don't read it like we used to read it no sorry ephesians 2 tells me that i'm quickened i already know that i'm quickened corinthians 3 18 tells me that i'm change that is in the past tense colossians 1 tells me that i'm translated is that right it's right there in the word of god amen we don't take it the way they used to take it we take it now by revelation so so i said i'm quickened and changed and translated because it's there in the anointing of my new birth is that right everything that i've got need of is right there so we find out that joseph when we come to him at this point he was in prison hallelujah and he was in prison for the word of god he was accused of falsely amen but what god was doing is going to now show him amen from restoration and judgment and so while he was there in prison i mean there was a butler and there was a baker right and both of them had dreams and and so they tell joseph their my their cellmate what their dreams were amen one was restored and the other was judgment and so the butler said to joseph he said listen when i get out of here i'm going to bring up your name before pharaoh what a promise when i'm out of prison i'm going to talk about you but you know what he was out of prison and he forget all about joseph people do that sometimes they make you real good promises when i'm exalted i'm going to remember you but he was not exalted and he didn't remember him but god was on the job hallelujah we're not waiting on man's time we're waiting in god's time is that right and god's going to bring everything to pass is that right so he was fulfilling the measure of his suffering because he had to suffer before he come into reign is that right and sometimes we don't want it that way but that is god's way joseph was coming to his position and the way god did it is that right god you know i said many times he said if we would have looked at our lives in a vision and see the way that god would have bring us to our redemption we would start a cry oh no god don't do that it's a right but but god's gonna bring you there sometimes he's dropping off he he's cutting off things that are part of you that's got to go hallelujah and that is what was happening to joseph you know brother brahms said we got to trim off all the high will and i can amen in order to get into god because when you get there god wants you to know that it's not you it is not you it is him and the more you can rely upon him is the more you can read the promises of god hallelujah amen so we find him as we look at this life we find joseph him and there in prison and he was there because he was accused of rape yet he was innocent verse nine we we find i'm gonna read keep reading the scripture in genesis 41 then spoke the chief butler on to fear of saying i do remember my fault fear and all i had this dream and in this dream the first time he had the dream and you know sometimes brother wait you can have a dream in the night and you know you you you wake up and you think about it and you go back to sleep and you've got another dream now here pharaoh he he was asleep and he had a dream and he had seen uh uh seven fat cows and then they were eaten up by seven uh thin cows and he woke up and he was confused and he went back to sleep again and and when he went back to sleep he didn't see he saw hears of corn seven a stall that had seven years of corn prosperity and then he'd seen one and so the dreams were related and pharaoh when he woke up he didn't know what it was right so fearono called for all his magicians and all of that and said if you can tell me what this is yeah right and none of them can tell hallelujah because they did not have the mind of god god was doing something and so the butler was there and he saw all of this and he said you know pharaoh i remember now my fault i think god hold that from him until the right time hallelujah pharaoh was wrought with a servant and put me in in ward in the in the captain of the gods house both me and the chief baker and we dream a dream in one night i and he we dreaming each man according to his interpretation of his dream and there was there and there and there was there with us a young man and hebrew servant of the captain of the god and we told him and he interpreted to us our dream and each one according to his dream he did interpret and it came to pass as interpret to us so was hallelujah me he restored unto my office and him he hang on hallelujah just like joseph and tell them and you know in this hour him and god use dreams vision and prophecy is that right verse 14 then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself hallelujah and changed his remnant and and came unto pharaoh hallelujah amen now you can see he's coming to the right hand of authorities coming up out of prison hallelujah is coming now to the the point of power hallelujah one day was a prisoner him in the nexa came in all self-will he was losing he shaved himself change his clothes take of all the excess he's coming now into his placing hallelujah something happened and an adverse situation but god knows what he's doing and pharaoh said unto joseph i have dream a dream and there is none that can interpret it hallelujah what happened that thing was sealed up right hallelujah the best magicians i mean they couldn't reveal it but there is a man in the dungeon hallelujah him and one anointed by god right hallelujah i want to jump over verse 25 and joseph said pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one and god has shown pharaoh what is about to do right amen so god's gonna do something and god didn't show it to joseph he showed it to pharaoh but then joseph is a man pharaoh said that has a spirit of god and he's in pharaoh's house and brethren here you are hallelujah things are happening in the world there's a the crashing of the monetary system i mean there's terrorism there's there's hallelujah there's all these things and you are right here amen and brethren as a bride of jesus christ where we've got a position amen because god had sent us a voice in this day amen that all that we're seeing now amen we have read it before we have plans over these things where we have to hear the vision amen and the dreams and the prophecies amen now it's your time you're coming into preview you know exactly what god wants but you've got to get into the right channel in the right place amen don't let it pass you by is that right amen hallelujah you know joseph he was in a particular position amen joseph is the fourth foundation upon which the masterpiece was built right is that right luther wesley pentecost here we are we have the thought and the fault is perfection joseph was perfection hallelujah him and so now it's coming to that time amen where something is about to happen amen you're at the right place at the right time amen it's all right hallelujah amen what i did we look at the third seal him in the third seal it speaks of a black horse in another third seal a measure of weed for opinion hallelujah amen so they are measuring all the wheat and the barley amen what's that famine in the land and the prophecies say that in this day there's going to be a prophecy not just for bread remember for the hearing of the word of god and yet they're going to run to and fro amen they are seeking for it the bible says they shall not find it right but where the carcass is where the word is the eagles will be gathered together is that right amen we gotta know exactly where we are amen because we we look at these things now and we're bringing them into perspective when we look at the first one amen religious deception let no man deceive you the second seal red horse there shall be wars and rumors of war the third holly there shall be famine the fort hallelujah pestilence hallelujah amen and we saw that in saint matthew 24 revelation 6 let us not just talk about them but let us take them out of the pages of the book and let them alive today is that right because they are not there to be placed in the book amen but they are there to tell you him in the signs of the time exactly where are we is that right hallelujah even i was just preaching over there and i was showing them all the bible said in genesis 6 amen when there were violence and cruelty upon the land amen god said we've come to the end of all flesh and we said look at the time that we're in amen we've got to realize that we've got that enoch anointing with its time is getting time for us to leave out a year amen hallelujah you're gonna recognize your time hallelujah the message that's revealing this time for you all right hallelujah so when the spirit well when the spirit-filled church shows all glory and power amen that's where we are hallelujah when the squeeze comes i mean all these things that the problem was talking about when the screens come he said watch the third pull then is that right hallelujah you see a church change in that day at church in perfection and you can't be perfection without your being cross is that right hallelujah amen we're coming now to the statue of a perfect man you're coming now into that joseph position is that right you're being tried and tested are you there hey now you're going to be exalted to that position but you've got to have the right vision the prophecies has got to be in place you got to know who called you where you are amen standing up on the foundation of the word of god is that right amen we've got to know that it's going to go beyond church oh i'm in the church i'm in the church it's going to be beyond that it's going to be to the individual and christ amen you're called up they've been called up into the revelation it is your time to show who you are amen hallelujah glory he said this will start rapturing fate oh hallelujah amen yes sir then does that type joseph yes sir hallelujah perfection amen verse 33 we come back to now therefore let pharaoh look out took out a man discrete and wise and sent him over the land of egypt no you're telling the king pharaoh you're now telling pharaoh look over your province find the man of this characteristic and set him over right mom who is king hello there is a man that the lord the spirit of the lord is with him is that right but he's coming to his exaltation he's already into prison no it's time for paradise hallelujah let pharaoh do this and and and let him appoint officers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt grace yes and let them gather all the food of those good ears you're gonna go back to what you had is it right i mean all the years you were reading and started go back to what you had because it was putting it there for a purpose now that which you have in your heart is going to be in manifestation exactly hallelujah but if it's not already there it can't be manifested hello somebody amen oh what did he say he said there's a no that word is gonna become one with you you're gonna become one with that word christ hallelujah amen for that day when this will be required amen and live corn under the the hand of pharaoh and let them keep food in the cities he's telling him now how to do it hallelujah amen you you see in the time when we see that aiming the economies were booming and we're taking out from it all that we could did we realize that god had a hand in this and so when the time of famine struck did we realize that god was still in it come on now if we praise god in the years of plenty then god has a hand in the famine is that right hallelujah and let them gather all the food of those good years and only they come so he's telling him what to do amen because the sick seal is coming in judgment is going to strike hallelujah this quiz is going to come on here's a rat this persecuted and haunted group that he speak of hello but we've got we already know what to do with the word amen hallelujah you see what it is today is a pressure to get into the system amen they're telling you that oh he never meant this or the prophet held at this point and so you see you don't have to take it that serious what a time after we have studied for years and we have stored all of this food now they're telling you oh you didn't have to do that oh come on with me somebody amen it's gonna take a stronger wind than this to move before my promises hello it's going to take a stronger wind than this i'm not here because somebody's here i'm not here because somebody follow it no sir i'm here because i was called to it hello my holy calling god called me by name and i'm positionally placed in the word is that right hallelujah joseph wasn't even down in egypt because he wanted to go no two adversaries amen he didn't want to go to egypt he was sold out ella he was an outcast amen he went down like a slave hello somebody remember that court that daddy gave him aiming of that seven colors is that right but brother branham said amid those seven colors of the rainbow if you shine lighter through the to the prison it gives that seven light and and by that he he started our dreams and and vision and he was hated for that is that right but he kept those things hallelujah amy you couldn't take from him that which god gave him israel hallelujah and you see the message come to us for a purpose but the message is for your preparation so when these times come you know exactly what you ought to do i will keep you from the hour of temptation because you've kept my word it's a wrath when the squeeze come because you've kept my word i will keep you from that hour of temptation because many are going to be tempted to walk away from it but i'll tell you if the foundation was right there's nothing that can move you you don't have to worry about the bride no she's secure that's right hello all right you don't have to worry about her feed her the word amen she'd be all right because god says so because her placing is in her calling is that right when you're going to he place you all abraham had to do was walk right and keep walking to adversaries walk and one day it was revealed to him oh hallelujah amen glory so the message is for our preparation when god revealed disaster in an impending disaster and crisis and chaos hallelujah that's going to struggle god reveal it hallelujah hey because god cares about us right is that right that god revealed to moses how to keep the people even through adversaries really right amen that here moses is a leader uh over 80 years old and two million people depending on him hello and he ain't got trucks of water he ain't got truckloads of food all he had is a little stick in his hand but upon the mountain when he met god that day all that he needed for the journey was right there in the call are you there with me i'm not worrying because all i need for the journey is during the call i don't care where you are i don't care where the bride is she might be in jamaica or philippines or africa i mean all that she's got need of it's right there in their call amen amen hallelujah jesus when when when judgment was going to strike god tell noah billahark amen and there's an impending danger for us but god has already tell us what to do we're worrying about it right no we're keeping our eyes on the mirror the word of god hallelujah verse 36 we're coming to the bride has got to have the mind of christ is that right the secret in the back part of god's mind is in the heart of the bride is that right that's what the prophet of god says when it comes down to the third poll he said it's not for public show i'm going to walk out there in lulu and tell her hey come we've got it where the carcasses the eagles will be gathered together there will be those walking around there beside you and they miss it and you catch it is that because no it's by the grace of god i thank god he opened my eyes to the word of god hallelujah amen because i tell you amen that the word herself will take the word himself and reveal herself in him himself to show she is a holiday matching part of the pieces really amen she's got to be the word herself reflecting the word himself hallelujah and he ain't complete without you that's why the bible speaks about the key of david you know what that that's a marriage hallelujah you're transferring your rocks upon holiday his shoulder amen the bride is married to him or sometimes we need to start to use the word wife amen hallelujah because there's an immaculate conception and she's giving birth to the word of god amen what the hell are we living in hallelujah amen and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of egypt that the land perished not through the famine and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of all the servant hallelujah amen and pharaoh said unto his servant can we find such a one as this a man in whom the spirit of god is i've already called all the magicians that they've called all the economy the economist of the world and they were trying to sort it out and and they didn't know what to do listen if they knew what they were doing 2008 we wouldn't be having a crash hello because they had years of famine and all that they did they failed but prophecy has got to fulfill right now is that right amen they didn't know what they were doing right they all feel right so we're moving from that civilization we're moving from the scientific and we're getting into faith faith will be your substance is it right because if they would have done it we wouldn't have since 2008 to today we wouldn't have that time we wouldn't have that time where people are struggling to find jobs we wouldn't have that time of shutting down we wouldn't have time with people losing hundreds of thousands of dollars hello if they had known what they were doing but it had to come to that because it's prophecy hello genesis coming back to revelation and it's got to be fulfilled and so the hour of temptation has we so many out that they who didn't have faith in the foundation can go to the pyramid they're going to walk away from it exactly right yes sir hello and so what you're going to find some good ones that you thought some strong ones that you thought are gonna walk away and

taking pride in themselves you know they got a thing when when people apply for jobs no you you go on facebook and you find them you find their profile online and you look exactly who they are and

other day i was looking at little kids and you know somebody was one little kid at a a little smartphone and was taking picture of another two and the little man he went down and his knee and you know

so pharaoh now begin to see that there was something in this prisoner hallelujah for as much as god as show you all this god show you all this hallelujah fear no realize that god is in the province hello somebody no i've got a chain because god is here all right this is a far cry from moses coming and said let my people go right right hello i see god in you hallelujah amen because phil realized this was theologian in the kingdom could not unlock the vision but joseph or jesus hallelujah who accused of rape and down there in the in hebrew and april who did not go to our schools no sir he doesn't bear a flame of reference but god is in him glory hallelujah glory so thou shall be over my house hey who's speaking pharaoh and he's talking to you because the economist couldn't do it and here now you're unlocking the secret of the time you're going to be over the house the bride's got to be the mercy seat hello yes sir hallelujah and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled right hello we're getting into a new time only the throne will i be greater than thou and pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set thee over the land over all the land of egypt all right exactly what what where are we getting placing placing when he was given that court that was his anointing and this is what it's for is placing you're going to be over my house oh hallelujah oh but from the time he was given the court to the time he was placed in pharaoh's house he had to go to prison he yeah oh he had to be sold out as a slave are you there with me you you want the life of joseph you want perfection the anointing but i'll tell you it's going to take you places sometimes you're not going to want to look at yourself there's going to be times you you're going to look at you and say look what i've become this is not what my parents desire of me oh my lord let me lose myself and find the lord in thee let all self be slain that my friends your only thief sometimes god gotta strip you down strip you down it's michelangelo doing a masterpiece on a piece of rock and what he had in his mind is moses is that right hallelujah you've got to understand the craft to see what the workman is doing hallelujah placing hallelujah this was revealing the vision to his brothers shalt thou have dominion over us hallelu into his father you mean the sun and the moon and the star will bow down to you come on come on they didn't understand when god was doing the work on you when god was moving you from where you are but all you had to do was to release yourself in the hands of almighty god and let god do the work are you there with me the problem with us many times we can't lose ourselves we don't think we can rely on god enough hallelujah you know i try to tell people i don't like flying because when i'm flying you see when i when my work if i fly you know we've got a little ten seat and when i'm flying i'm looking right at the pilot if he looks like he's gonna make a mistake i'm watching you now i'm watching you but when you go in this big jet i i know what the guy's doing up there and i i was cultured to be in charge you know amen i say okay do this and he do it and and do that and he do it but when i'm in this i'm sitting back there and they they're moving backward and forward i was in a flight and i see the pilot because you know he's got the heart and the the air pollutant you come sitting in the seat and talking to somebody that you know i was like hey come on now i mean i need to go up there and see what's going on but but you know you lose control that's our problem we want to be in control you know amen you know after i watch the children you know they play school and the one that is a teacher the first thing they will take a strap and start to whip somebody amen you got to be in charge amen i've set the over the land of egypt hallelujah verse 42 hallelujah i have set thee pharaoh he can do it hallelujah he's got the power to do it right hallelujah verse 42 and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand think about god with you now hallelujah lord i want to reach that point in you lord god when you look over all that have been true and all the places you have bring me lord and the times when i felt insignificant lord will there be a day when you're gonna pull your ring and put it on my finger hallelujah and said samuel when you were a boy i called you and you didn't know where you were going and many times you think that you lost it but i was always on the job amen somebody oh that's where he was now and he took off his ring from his hand and he put it hallelujah put it hallelu and joseph and and array him investor of fine linen and put a guild chain about his neck adoption placing setting him positionally with authority is that right and i'll tell you god don't call you to lose you he didn't save you to lose you he will be defeating his purpose the fact that god called you has got a place for you somewhere amen sometimes those around you don't see it and they think that you're stupid they don't think they're going anywhere i mean but god is on the job and he know exactly what he's doing am i talking to somebody this morning hallelujah oh jesus i'm going there hallelujah and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had and they cried before him and bow knees and and made him ruler over all over all the land of egypt hallelujah and pharaoh said unto joseph i want you to note this part pharaoh is saying to joseph i am pharaoh it is not that joseph don't know that this is pharaoh but he's stamping his authority he's now giving him not just position but authority and so when he gave him this authority he said now listen to me i am pharaoh i am not second in charge i'm not fair as well i am fairer he's stamping that authority because many times people get position and they ain't got no authority in management school they tell me it's wrong to do that if you give the man the position you got to give him the authority and god don't do it like that brother when god gives you the position of placing god gives you the authority and and god is even saying in the church let me move away from god is even saying in the church is there any sick among you hello you got any elders let them call for the elders of the church let them anoint them with oil and the prayer of faith come on shall save the sick and if they commit any sin it shall be forgiven that's authority that god has given to you is that right can those believe it oh hallelujah amen jesus hallelujah oh the second this is the second ride coming here you're riding in the second chariot you're right there with me i'm now looking at myself and lord there you are and i have confidence now because i know i'm right there with you i'm in the second chariot because you ride this road before i'm gonna ride this trail again oh hallelujah hallelujah and lord i'm right there now with you oh jesus is the spirit and the bride saying come amen is that to be the church in perfection is that to be the manifestation of the sons of god that is where pharaoh was bringing him joseph i'm gonna bring you places right i'm gonna take your place bride i'm gonna take your places i'm gonna teach you things that you did not know i'm gonna give you authority that you did not know you have i'm going to let you come to that position where there is problem in this body i'm going to let you talk to this body hello somebody because i am the lord that he let thee and i send my words to heal you that's right oh hallelujah yes sir there's a time of the key of david when the bridegroom and the bride becomes one oh yes sir hallelujah in the same hallelujah harmony between the father and the son that same harmony is with the bride and christ jesus if you can prove the first what about the second amount hello if you can prove the father and the son is one then what about the bride and christ and how come you break that unity in your belief in the word take what the word of god say about you hello somebody and if you don't doubt um i just preached this back at home you know brother branham said in that message as i was with moses so will i be with you he said when he he said to me if you would get the people to believe you i say they will not believe me god didn't say that he said i say that he said because of this you'll be given two signs hallelujah and by these signs they would believe and he said the problem with the ministry is that they start to follow the signs and the commission was left behind and so 1960 says i've come past this mountain long enough you know brethren we come back to the same place in the second ride of the ministry of malachi 4. that we're following after but we're doubting the authority that is given to us to use hello somebody by the position that god has put us into is that right hallelujah and so you know we we come and i want to be touched i want to be poured i'll upon how i want everything to happen i remember when i was a child and and oral roberts used to be on the radio and he would have said put your hands on the radio i remember mama put her hands on the little old transistor radio i mean think that she's gonna draw fate from it but our commission oh the bible said well peter yet speak these words hello and here we are this morning the commission is already yours is saying his word to heal you why can't you believe it's a right so here now in genesis is telling joseph you are the joseph you are the perfection you are in the second chariot my word is in you i am pharaoh when i say oh jesus and he's saying to joseph joseph whatever you say whatever you say you know why it was important it wasn't the time pharaoh was saying it because if the feasts had not yet come but after those seven years of feasts and the famine struck what fear was no saying that's what is going to be important and so that's why we don't see it as important because if you're in the feast and it says there's a famine coming and you ain't seeing nothing yeah i didn't see nothing you just saying it but when that time come then you will know hallelujah are you with me amen we got in our position she will finish the ministry of the son of man amen that that's her position you ain't going to come back and finish no go back and read some luke 17. right hallelujah it's in you the bride you're gonna finish the mysteries hallelujah yes sir what do you think the word is for every age that word is in you and the faith and the training hallelujah amen that you're here under him it's for a purpose the message is for preparation is that right it's not for coming to church it's not to go into fellowship meetings it's not to identify yourself we message people it's preparation for the other side because one day that which is inside of you you're going to speak come on brother hello that's why he was putting joseph in that position you're coming on to speak in terms because i give you that authority hello but we become afraid to exercise that which god has already given you we stand again like moses there at the red sea and crying because of people crying what are we going to do we might as well put our hands in the air and die we might as well just give up we might as well don't go no further we matter hello amen without faith is impossible to please god hallelujah this is not your church feeling this oh yes brother keith i feel that brother keith oh yes i'm gonna move upon that you're gonna take the word of god hallelujah amen i can see prophecies fulfilling everywhere hallelujah son go call my children hallelujah because it's a midnight cry we're gonna go home is it right people get ready the train is gonna leave remember that message the flashing red light of the sun of his coming he said now the light began to flash around the corner that's right where we're coming to and he said they begin to put away the peanuts and you know get all your things together amen put because what i mean i see the light shining i know the train is coming on amen i know it's time to go amen we've got to get ready hallelujah we're preparing we will prepare ourselves all this time and now it's time we've got to go hallelujah brother branham was saying that that is a true throw away your peanut and everything else see the flashing red light of the sign of his coming and look up and lift up your your head because your redemption drawn nigh hallelujah amen look after the placing now hallelujah's place and time all that which you have amen brother branham hallelujah let me add that vesture amen it was dressed as chief amen but here you are now it is not your ride what the people try to do they take everything from the bride and and they're looking for the prophetic forerunner aiming to come on the scene again and to set up a tent and he's gonna do this and hey you're not going to see it that's right amen you might as well snap and wake up out of your dream because you ain't going to see it because what you see now that's it amen that's right and if you miss the first ride you're gonna miss the second ride amen and if you can't identify yourself in the first you'll never identify yourself in a second hallelujah amen you can walk around and say oh where the brother cries but you'll miss your authority and you ain't got nothing right right amen oh she's gonna be weak and powerless except she understand who she is hallelujah amen hallelujah oh we got to come to our position is that right right amen the son of man that position hallelujah bride standing in the position of christ jesus tell them back then all they said but moses because that's the greatest authority that they could look back in the old testament but jesus said before hallelujah amen he said moses give you but i say unto you are greater than moses was standing there the queen of the south but a greater than solomon is here amen a greater than jonah is here you've got to recognize present tense where we are hallelujah the one that's in our midst amen the prophet come back hallelujah this day and said who do men say that i the son of man what was he saying to you hallelujah amen revelation 10 comes down we've got to under identify with these scriptures hallelujah verse 44. amen i'm going to break this portion and pharaoh said unto joseph i am pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of egypt what authority what authority without you so i'm listening to the radio and i hear they're saying i'm talking about the wars and and the plagues and and all of this really and i ain't perturbed i ain't worrying about it because i've got a voice that's already spoke and i know my position is that right and i know all these things must come to pass and the bible but the end is not yet because it's waiting on the readiness of the bride for the bride to come into the unity of the fit is that right because as long as you're absent from the word then the rapture can't take place because he's waiting on you to get ready is that right hallelujah amen and so hallelujah the bible said his weight is on the unity of the feet no they're seeing him as son of god in the church they've got to come to that point where they identify the son of man that is here with us oh yes the bride will have thus saith the lord she will be an invincible army not even debt can harm her is that right she will be a super church a super race as she near the headstone she will be in the very own image hallelujah for the key of david hallelujah to place in order to unite her with him she's going to be united with him hallelujah she will be the pyramid city the heavenly jerusalem the lamb's wife hallelujah the city of the living god and i'll write my name in her forehead i'll show it in the sky hallelujah amen and the famine is only going to tell you that you are to walk out in your authority hallelujah christ you see then then pharaoh began to give joseph a new name brother branham said when a name is changed victory won a victory won the victory's already won because the name of you know in the old testament he said i'll surname you that's what he told them a surname you he didn't change your first name he changed your last name you know he put you in the family and so you don't feel like an old cast you know you're a part of it if i make a mistake i'm still reading right and if i'm victorious i'm still reading and if i lie down and sleep i'm reading if i sit up and sleep i'm still reading you can't take that from me because my father's dna isn't sad hello somebody amen and i'll tell you what i'm shocked like him i look like him and when i speak i speak like him is that right even then people seem to say hey read amen and sometimes they're talking about me they're talking about my daddy about him and they see me in him and i've got a heavenly father who said i've sir named you hallelujah and so i've got his name and so fair enough you begin to verse 45 he begin to change joseph's name and give him a name prince of the life of the age is that right eno becomes the life of what they're going through oh jesus amen hallelujah whatever happened you bride you're going to be the life of this age there's not going to be any life outside of you you're going to hold the key to unlock if there's going to be metamorphosis in this time by what we're seeing you're going to hold the key to all of that so you're going to start to accept who you are i totally believe we missed our authority in the word that we don't know what the word of god say about us and and because of that what we do in this economy recession we worry we look at our business and we struggle and we go and ask the experts what we ought to do and we do all these things really and i'll tell you one thing i've got two business degree and i wouldn't know what to do with the economy but by the holy ghost i've got a remedy right i've got a panacea that will work hallelujah because there's people in the province in this day the brother jesus christ who've got the word of god may god bless you this morning as we speak the word of god hallelujah amen you enjoy the message let's give our brother a good hand but we believe it right recognizing your day in this message now that we're living gonna
