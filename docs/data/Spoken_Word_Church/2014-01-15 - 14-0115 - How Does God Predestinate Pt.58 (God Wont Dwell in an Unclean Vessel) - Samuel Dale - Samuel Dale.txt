========================================

Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart shining in the heart of your glory amen pour out your power in love foreign then just look right into the word and you'll find him right good to see everybody in the house the Lord if you like turning your scriptures turns where we've been reading in Romans eight and then we will go to first John 2. Romans 8 first John 2. I know you've prayed for him but remember brother Dale Roberts sorry you know he's had that stroke I know it really put him down you know I was talking to him the other day and you know he was up and all but I know he don't want to be down he's like me he he don't want to lay around in everything so Jesus pray for him to the Lord bring him out of that thing and make everything all right remember other sick ones Among Us and just keep praying because we believe that by Stripes were healed all right and remember now the fellowship meeting will be this Saturday at brother Tom Christians we will be leaving at 10 o'clock from my house Wade's house we already have 13 as far as we know right now so we're going to have to take a couple of vehicles we know for sure but now don't come up late you know and come in you may have to drive because we're trying to get everything set where we can make it you know but you need to let us know and to some of the others like Sister Barbara sister Freda you need to call somebody and let us know for certain uh don't leave it up that we've done put it on eat my old coach I don't get one all right so you can't depend on me well so you'd better do that all right any other announcements I know you made the announcements you know but let's just pray father we thank you for this day in your grace thank you for everything Lord that you've given unto us what we like about it is is free freely given we don't have to do anything just accept it just receive it and Lord what a wonderful opportunity that we have to be able to receive eternal life in our soul receive a Redemption of these bodies at one day they'll be totally made new receive healings and oh Lord in our life and blessings and wonderful things we thank you for all of it we look around the world we see how horrible things are we realize how great we have it Lord and what you've done for us but just come now Lord and speak to us and just open our eyes that we may see you and Lord just let your love be with each and every one of us forgive our sins God we want to be covered in the blood and guide us now in Jesus name amen Romans 8. 28-31 now I want to if I can tonight I don't know I'll try to if I can maybe Sunday we'll be able to just scan through a message with very few quotes maybe and uh try to put down what we're talking about so that you can understand what we're saying you know and doing and then uh we'll try to maybe Sunday afternoon have questions and answers so if you have anything write it down we'll try to cover it and and you know try to be do as much as we can all right so just just do that Romans 8. and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are thee called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren or for whom he did predestinate them he also called in whom he called him he also just justified in whom he justified them he also glorified all already done as far as God is concerned but now as far as we're concerned we're still here in a journey right what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us we're now not memorized by now 58 times that we've read it so far first John 2 . verse 15. love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and he goes on to say verse 17 you can be seated it goes on to say but the world will pass away that's right all right now but to him that doeth the will of the father will abide all right now we know that when he's saying uh you know love of the world neither the things that are in the world he's not talking about life right and because we've got to live all right he's not talking about um having an a new car and that's worldly that's what tickles me you see people they'll preach against uh things and hard and hard and hard but then let them get kind of along you know and things begin to pick up a little bit and you see them pick up a little bit and you know they're driving a new car you know you know but see they forget all of those things that they screamed and hollered about calling the world now if you're head over heels in debt you know and you can't pay the payments and then you go buy a new car that is not only worldly that's stupid I mean that is that okay because you're you're you're going after those things so then it's not the fact of having something it's not the fact of enjoying life seeing people to preach against going to worldly events you know well they'll just hammer it to death about worldly events wrote around them out there in California went to the what was it World fire like Six Flags type of a thing and he said you're taking kids out there while you're out here it is New World yeah yeah and you see he was out constantly hunting and fishing and doing you know it's not that type of thing that you need to be concerned about it's things that will Captivate Us to keep us away from God whether it be hunting fishing new cars uh clothes uh you know new church worldly things that we've got to be you know like the world see it's not just the Natural Things of Life all right now say that because when we get on over into the point in a minute then I won't have to stop and explain when I talk about the world the world is not eating drinking doing and living and making a living and stuff like that that's not worldly events yeah well that's your business go ahead because that way you're condemned for everything even if you ate too much supper tonight see if you're going to take one little thing you got to take it all right right that would be part of the world all right but now we've been talking about trying to get to a place to understand what is brother random talking about when he says that when we come here with a seed in US you know and then it's like this last Sunday we were talking about that he said you always was eternal and we've covered all of those things you know and we're I asked the questions our Sunday where is that seed at if it was put there when was it put there and what kind of a seed is it you know we said well brother then we believe he's in the soul that's a good place to start but when was it put there we'll go back through these things in a minute but it was put down the prophets didn't work before the foundation of the world all right so when he comes along he says I come into the world this seed in me when was it put there when you was in your mom was wound when you dropped out of the womb or was it put there before the foundation of the world all right if we're going to go with him we have to go with what he's saying if not we just take our own thoughts and ideas and not worry about it all right I gave it to you Sunday on the invisible Union paragraph 152. where brother Brown says the seed of God and I'll read it again in a minute can't be in him at the same time the love of the world is there now you see a word that you'd go wrong with what I read if you don't understand what the world is see then you would say anybody went to ball game can't see to God let's go ahead and play your little games because it's going to be over with but now let's think about what John is saying that if we love the world or the things of the world the love of the father is not in US now that's scripture that's scripture I believe it but as I said now is it this or is it that or well it's just being worldly well then I I've come to find out what people call worldly is what I I don't want to do or don't do but you do that's that's worldly so you do yeah people in this message see they oh man give them Christmas trees boy I told some brothers here that was in a church that used to put out tracks about it and the brother got married and I said you wait till the baby comes along no way no way it's okay so Mama comes up expecting you the first year it was kind of announced like this well you can just do what you want to about the Christmas trees ain't gonna say nothing gonna see the next year the baby was there and they put one up you know we'll see we can preach against what is worldly it's worldly to have a new car let somebody offer you one well now that's a different thing it is it's a different thing it's a new car if it's worldly let's see and then I get so tickle that people they'll preach against birth control until they get about seven or eight kids and all at once right in the middle of Life they just stop having any and that don't happen you know so evidently all at once they got the Revelation and so what is worldly now we're going to go through this in a minute the Bible says you can't serve God and Mammon right so I'm asking you a question up front will God dwell in an unclean vessel when you got a lot of scripture about things that are unclean right you got a man named Isaiah that said I'm a man of unclean lips well he wouldn't even go out and speak until God cleaned his lips you see you know you got these unclean unclean unclean throughout the scriptures I said and just think about it would God dwell in an unclean Festival well then what is it what are we doing as I said are we using the scriptures and the things of the message to just justify ourselves I don't do this but you do that you know and that's why you don't see me preaching so much about those type of things because everybody has their own definition of what worldliness is and I could preach 49 sermons on what it is and it wouldn't change one thought of anybody I know that it takes God to to do it you ever heard brother Branham scream out against Ricky's and ricketters right but all at once one day he said God said don't call him Rick he's a ricketta that's my children you remember that right see it took God to straighten the prophet out you understand so let's don't worry about ourselves let's just try to be what we are all right so we went through trying to cover and this is the point I want you to look at that I believe truly and I've read over and over to you well the prophet's message the Bible we read in predestination that a seed was in US when we come into the world but not a literal half of a seed but God's foreknowledge and in his mind you know that in God's mind Jesus Christ died before the foundation of the world right but when did he literally die 2 000 years ago is that the quotes we were given Sunday like from um God keeps his word but it was in his mind and remember now as we've covered before lengthy Services out of it in this series that Judas was in his mind and Judas had his name written in the Book of Life now not in the lounge book of life section of the Eternal but he had his name written in the Book of Life and it was taken out see God then doesn't predestinate by his desires he predestinates by his foreknowledge all right that way we can keep everything together see then as far as God is concerned when Jesus Christ was slain in his mind our names were written in the last book of life before the foundation of the world in his mind you remember them do we need to go back over them like he said on God keeping his word that God spoke and said Christ was the lamb slain from the foundation world when God drew his program in his mind and spoke it Christ was slain there though he actually wasn't slain for four thousand years later and got in there through foreknowledge seen who would be saved and who would not and their names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life at the foundation of the world and associated with the slain lamb you see that's what I've tried my best to get you to see laughs that you send me any quote that the prophet has said in I'm not a bragger or nothing but I believe the Holy Spirit will put that together in the message in the right order now I may have to tell you I don't understand that right now but I'll get back to him to you when he speaks to me no problem but see if our names were written to our then he goes on like in Hebrews chapter 7 we were talking about he said where was Jesus slain at Calvary no sir Jesus was slain before the foundation world Amen amen before the Lamb of God that was slain before the foundation World God in the beginning when he saw the sin he saw what would happen he spoke the word and Jesus was slain before the foundation of the world and every person was saved was saved according to the Bible when the lamb was slain in the mind of God before the foundation of the world see it's in his mind right but now my point was to try to get you to see Sunday if what he sees in his mind doesn't happen on Earth you know or whatever it is about that's in his mind he might see the white Throne he might see something you know but you you know what I'm talking about if God sees something and speaks it it will come to pass right all right see because it's a spoken word right right all right see then it was necessary that he come and die because if he hadn't come and die that would make that false prophecy right you remember we went through all of that but he goes on like like a serpent seed to say the Bible said that we were predestinated to the sons and the sons and Adoption of the sons of God before the foundation world and when God slayed the lamb in his own thinking before the foundation of the world to prove out his attributes what he was when the lamb was slain we were slain with him when the blood of the Lamb was caught in his own mind back there before the foundation of the world mining your names were written on the book then all his great thinking he's infinite now what is it then who is this Melchizedek 65. paragraphs 53. think of it before Jesus was even born 4 000 years before he came on Earth and several thousand years before you came on Earth Jesus in God's mind died for the sins of the world and the Book of Life was made and your name was put on that book of life before the foundation of the world that's the Bible truth see and your name was ordained of God and placed on the book of life before the foundation of the world either in his attributes you don't remember it no because you're just a part of his life he said you're part of God when you become a son and daughter of God right then we read from Christ The Mystery of God revealed paragraph 467. the seed was there the seed was already when was it put there before the foundation of the world has predestinated us unto eternal life and as soon as the life-given flow that seed laying there other seeds that would come in wouldn't take hold just couldn't do it but when that seed come in it quickly stopped up the wound all the rest of the seed was drove out the when was it put dark before the foundation of the world now what was before the foundation of the world were we people back there we gave it from questions and answers when we read Around said no we wouldn't ask him was we Spirits he said no he said we went nothing it was just in the mind of God well then in the mind of God what was his mind seeing what would take place here that should be simple to us then we ought to be totally away from the thoughts of some kind of a seed put in there a spot now remember any spot of God is just as much God as all of God is God right so then I would consider what's you know people say well brother Dale when you say it it just sounds flat but when these others say it is so wonderful and they could just lead me through and I could just look I could see myself there what was you doing we've been through it right we've been through the morning star sign together sons of God shouted for joy was we look back to our shouting or was it were we in God's mind shouting or when we would come down here and receive it brother devil always was eternal if you have eternal life the eternal life we have all right always was eternal just the same as his seeds remind us then this is John said and we cannot sin see when God sees something and I tried to get you to look at it when he sees something he sees it totally finished he doesn't see it as we look at it yeah he sees it totally finished but yet we want to lay on this the the quotes of and I keep bringing that one out just what I brought out others and I'm bringing out you know I will later again we say that little woman at the whale the prophet said that seed was laying there he said it immediately come to life well amen but that didn't give her the new birth see there you say I don't need the new barrels all I need is a knowledge of who I was before the world brother Dale that is my new birth I told you 30 years ago they'd be saying that now they are yeah all right because why people are going to fall after the real truth and and preach on it but how could that little woman at the well be born again when Jesus Christ hadn't died according to the scripture the disciples couldn't be born again until after Jesus's death well what's running around talking about just what I'll give to you and preach to you many many times right around them on perfect faith 1963. he's talking about the little woman at the well he said she had perfect faith for that time right you know that in Acts 14 and 9 Paul says perceiving that he had faith to be healed see where to get into scripture Paul looking down or Peter was looking down see him receive it that he had faith what for healing so then right over here tonight God can drop down in this church right over here heal the people he can save people if the atmosphere is correct right you see we want to make it some kind of a mysterious story that makes us feel oh brother when brother so and so preached like this I just get so excited I I just see me jumping around and running around up in heaven we'll run around and said what page 153 Samaritan Church age in your church age book I want to make it known to you I want you you will want to know if I believe in the doctrine of pre-existence I don't believe in that that Mormon Doctrine a pre-existence of Souls because they believe we're literal people back there right yeah my brother told me he said well he didn't say he didn't believe in some form of pre-existence well I believe in pre-existence I believe in pre-existence of eternal life don't you that's why when I receive eternal life I'm just as Eternal I said yes but he said I don't believe in that Mormon doctrine of pre-existence of souls because see they believe we're literal people literally people he said I don't believe in reincarnation he's talking about our souls are the transmigration of Souls now according to Webster transmigration is going from one form to another one so he didn't believe in doing that in reincarnation is you know you hear and you come back in another form he said I didn't believe don't believe that but he believed in pre-existence of eternal life sir and if you have eternal life tonight that eternal life always was eternal all right we see people are saying but brother Dale I've always been taught that I come into the world with eternal life already in me well I'm asking a simple question that's what I asked the two Soul people back in the first part of 70. I said God won't dwell in an unclean vessel they gave you a soul from God and a soul from the Devil and I said first off devil can't create so that leaves it out and the Bible said All Souls are mine so if the devil had some to give out he had to get them from God to get them out and we know he didn't do that but they said well what he was doing said it was that seed laying in our dormant adornment means lifeless that's what it means well was it some form of a seed or Speck a spot a word or was it his foreknowledge now which one is it but I'm just asking a simple question can the seed of God be in US as a seed like we think not thinking of predestinations and foreknowledge is we'll get to it about the little woman he said she had predestination she had uh from foreknowledge but my point is is it's some kind of a spot see a lot of you never knew the two Soul Doctrine you went back there but they'd draw out a heart and they put spots in it and they said that's what's in you that spot's within you well I believe when brother random preached a future home did he drawn out a heart and then he drawed another heart and in one of them he put a dove and the other one he put the devil and I believe he was talking about the same Soul heart whatever because he was explaining regeneration is he taking the devil out and God coming in which is really God coming in is what drives the devil out amen just put it that way all right see then what was God living in there if he was my question there was the same as our now do you mean to tell me that in any form whatsoever any form whatsoever now you see where I'm putting it that the devil is greater than God yeah you don't be little God way down when you say the devil is greater and he's only permitted I see they said God give you so devil give you soul Holy Ghost come down kill the soul of the devil the other soul never needed nothing because it always was eternal now that was their Doctrine now is that what you believe that's not what I believe is what I believed in it ain't what I believe now amen because I'm still of a firm believer and you must be warned again I'm a firm believer in justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'm a firm believer in that if God comes and lives in you and I we're not going to live like the world we're going to live in the world and the things of the world that are not sinful outlandishly wrong I explained while ago about world see don't tell me that you can go out and commit adultery and say you're born again don't tell me you can lie cheat and steal drink smoke and say you're born again at least out there on the internet you hear it from me tonight nothing else I've never taught anything like that and I don't believe it I believe you're born again those things are supposed to die he said but brother Dale I still got problems all right I do too brother Branham did too why did he keep a cross hanging on his mirror he said he had it why because you don't go after the world you see if somebody's living in sin they're not born again I said that one time the brother left here on account of that because I told him I said I'm just telling you want to believe brother if you live in like that you're not born again you're telling me I ain't born again yeah go ahead yeah that's what I'm telling you if you live like that you ain't born again because that's the things of the world well you don't think we can make mistakes you don't make them ever other day you know I mean let's don't get into the garbage cans that you know we can run a few days and get out here and commit adultery for three or four days been quit for a month then go back and I just can't stand it now you need to be born again lying cheating stealing drinking all right why because God won't dwell in an unclean vessel now my here's my whole point for the night he won't dwell in an unclean vessel after you're born again and he will not live in an unclean vessel before you get born again because why would he want to make you clean see now you're putting eternal life and that's what people are saying it always was eternal you're putting eternal life into the soul if you want to put it or whatever you want to put in position whatever and then saying you was living like the devil but but brother Dale that wasn't me living that way I was that other well why didn't that other control I mean it looked like God would win the battle sometime right see a lot of you don't know the two Soul Doctrine you never heard it you know what they said when a baby's coming into the world this is what the man said I talked with him I knew him he said when the baby's coming into the world they did so that babies dropped out of that mother said the Devil beats God to her and puts his soul just want to talk so then God comes along behind you know I'm having trouble and he puts his soul that's you want me to illustrate it that's what I'm talking about you mean to tell me and that's what I told him I said look like sometime God would have got there first right of course we got there first there wouldn't have been no sin in the garden right but you see that's where people don't realize and they don't realize they've been taught things until somebody says it then the first reaction is you think I don't know how to look at faces but now listen it was a man one time that he was talking to the Lord Jesus Lord Jesus said and we'll read it right here he said Peter he said after you're converted strengthen the brethren yeah but brother they only had yeah they did because Jesus was with them come on I don't think I can't follow a line Jesus when he was here with him he gave them power to do what they were doing which was to cast out devil heal the sick Etc but when he was ready to leave he called him in right why because he was not going to be able to be there right as before he called him in and said Don't You Preach no more until you're endued with power from on high then when they were endued with powerful on high Jesus was not just with him he was in them right that's right he said Peter let's just read it let's start right here now if I go a little empty tonight forgive me if you need to go get up and go now no problem I just want to get this part out and then we can do it go ahead with number one which is questions and answers 1954 uh 5 16. E21 and he's explaining about Peter and coming down and when he gets down he says after you're converted well I've been baptized by you know who's this Peter right Jesus Christ baptized Peter there's an argument in the message of whether Jesus was baptized or were they baptized each other who baptized what and come on he baptized he is the apostles all right now he said now I've been baptized by I've done all these things and I've walked by you I've been saved and you give me power okay you wouldn't expect God to put that power in an unclean vessel so he had to clean them up and give them a life of of sincerity anyhow before he he let them go out and preach the gospel and he returned back rejoicing said well even the Devils is subject to us that's before Calvary you know your Bible he gave him power but he on he cleaned them up first come on are you reading it they went through justification and sanctification right that was cleaning them up the unclean Spirit went out of a man sanctification all right for he let him preach when he was there with him all right and why then he said now Peter I know all this but you're not converted yet the you're not right yet Peter you're not converted but after Thou Art converted then strengthen your brethren Peter hadn't received the Holy Ghost yet see when the Holy Ghost come then Peter was an inspired teacher amen amen all right move on to the next one hear ye him 19. 58 e29 do you think that God would put new you think God would put his holy oil in an unclean vessel certainly not as I said go into Leviticus and read of the cleansing and you just didn't pick up something and you know you just go get your cup is laying out in the yard that's a good cup make a drinking cup you wouldn't even do it now right what do you do you wash the thing it's unclean now remember what I'm talking about so you won't lose my thought I'm going to repeat it repeat it and repeat it I don't believe you come here with eternal life in you amen and don't need to be born again to receive eternal life I don't believe that he said well I you're off the message I'll leave goodbye I taught this 40 years ago why change now I've always taught it that away it's always believed it that way I don't believe you come in the world with eternal life in you and you lost in a sinner where was it at when your show was lost and needed salvation Jesus had to clean up the disciples before he lived let them preach then he had to burn out all the rest of it before you let them go by himself now do you think that God would put his holy oil in an unclean vessel read the Old Testament rules and see if he put oil over in an unclean vessel now come on all right look at this next one and inside excuse me an uncertain sound paragraph or E39 through the church means are called out and separated and two people can't live in you the same time you've got to die out to the things of the world to serve God you can't love God and Mama at the same time and as long as the love of the world is in the the believer's heart he crowds out and deprives himself from the Privileges that God's give him all right what are we doing you can't believe two people can't live in now now brother Dale but remember now about the white dog black dog you need to read the old Indian said after me born again after me get Holy Ghost now Black Dog white dog he didn't say before he's born again right see the two Soul people and all that people now believe there was two Natures there the nature of God and the nature of the world they don't want to call it Souls because they don't want to be related to the old doctrines that went into polygamy we see they don't want to go along with it but two people can't be in you at the same time going to the next this is the one I was quoting while ago and been quoting invisible Union paragraph 157 Jesus said you cannot serve two Gods at the same time you either serve God or Mama is the world he that loves the world are the things of the world the love of God is not even in him the seed of God can't be in him the same time the love of God the love of the world you know what he's he's not talking wrong he's quoted it wrong said the love of the world is in there when the seed of God is operating through you that's the word of God the little over the world can't be in there at the same time now where is the short hire and the shorts and the painted face Now where's it at you can't be there so the seed of God can't be in you at the same time as the seed of Satan or Satan in his ways and we were all born in Satan's domain whether we like it or not and born kin folks to the devil and had to be born again that's what Nicodemus couldn't understand right now what's this next one taken from spoken words reading a seed 1962 paragraph 198. excuse me 196. he said if you're not yours no more come on just roll it up because you can read all in between and see it was waiting germs night he can't be a hybrid and a son at the same time he's either a son of death or son of life right so if he's the son of death get it over to the devil and let him give it over to God I meant and let him kill the devil that's in you run him out haulers you out then let God plan his own life in you and it's not you no more it's God's life because it's God's word watered by the Holy Spirit and will produce the same thing yes I just love to preach on that a few minutes but with that 30 40 pages of scripture he'd have to go through all right listen look at the next one Abraham preached 1955. 56 excuse me 55 yeah e61. you say you come around you praise the Lord you do this you know if a seed goes into the ground a grain of wheat it cannot produce anything else but a grain of wheat so if you go around and say well praise the Lord I've been saved I got the Holy Ghost and I live any kind of a life you better get back to the altar of God again because the Incorruptible seed of God come on you just read what your Prophet said cannot be one thing you cannot be a wheat and a kookabur at the same time you've got to be either you've got to either be a wheat or a kookaburra you all got cuckoo birds down here all right Greenbrier then ever what you want to call them thanks from the week you can't be a weed and a wheat at the same time if you've got the spirit in you of the life of the wheat you'll produce wheat if you've got the spirit into you the life of the Kookaburra it'll be a kookaburra and if the Holy Ghost is in you you'll believe God love God and act like a Christian that's right if it isn't you'll know them by the fruits they buy her okay all right what about it what about it how many times I didn't write this down but how many times do you think brother Brown said white bird black bird black bird white bird and said you can't be that you can't be a white bird or a blackbird you're either a white bird or a blackbird now he ain't talking about no speckled up that's hybrids right yes where you won't run your silly mind in the wrong direction what's he talking about so let's go to that this is healing and what sickness is in 1950. e22 and there's only two resources that Spirits can come from that's either from God or the devil there's no halfway between them there's no Highway Christian did you ever see a drunk sober man did you ever see a black white bird you've never seen a center Saint you're either a Christian or you're a sinner that's what I like about you Full Gospel people you put the line down and you're on one side or the other if you're born again if I'm born born to human I'm a human when you're born a Christian you're a Christian all right black white bird go to the next one Israel in the church 1953. paragraph 31. I said I'm a pretty good Christian I said no you're not there is no pretty good Christian how many ever seen a drunk sober man nobody how many ever seen a black white bird nobody it's either you've never seen a sinner signed you're either born again or you're not born again you're either on one side of the fence now if you are born again you have everlasting life and there's nothing within you all the old things that have passed away and there's just the fountain bitter and sweet watch you don't come from the same fountain bitter and sweet don't come from it we're going to read that scripture in just a second the tree is known by the fruit it bears by the fruits you shall know them go into James Street unless you see what he's talking about James 3 out of the same mouth precede His blessings and cursings you remember bother what he's explaining the tongue is the member it can't be tamed first time mouth proceedeth blessings and cursing my brethren these things ought not to be so not so to be now watch him if it's if you've seen the fountain do it or if you've seen the brother or sister doing it you don't judge them and condemn them to hell but you know there's something wrong right or they wouldn't be that way right so now what's wrong well I mean come on you tell me the prostitute that Jesus you know there was and told her about her you know the lady with the husbands and the prostitutes told to go and sin no more you know and all the one with the five and all you think they went home and kept up their product their uh job now if you do there's something wrong with you mentally let alone spiritually yeah but that was a white note we're not talking about silliness because what does he say he's telling you that can't be why he says does the fountain send forth at the same time Sweet Water and bitter it cannot be getting the Fig Tree my brethren by Olive berries either of iron figs so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh saying these things Brethren ought not to be because you're showing you lost right you're showing you lost come on look at this one about the white bird black bird spiritual Amnesia 1964. I'd like to get on over in and come over in Vice to 63s there were people always changed his mind this is taking spiritual Amnesia in 1964. Birmingham Alabama you must be identified some were you must show your life shows tonight and where you are identified you are identified either in Christ are out of Christ you're not the highway there is no such a thing as a drunk sober man there is no black white bird you're either saved or you're not saved you are a saint or a sinner one of the other and your spiritual attitude towards God's word identifies you exactly where you're standing repeat it again I don't believe you come into the world with eternal life in you as a possession as a soul from God and then you had a soul from the devil it came because if you come into it with a soul from God and it was eternal why did you do wrong now come on like I said the other day which side do you want to take because you're going to make it bump your mind you're going to be on the side when I come in the world with eternal life don't need nothing and if you move over on the other side in any way and say but I need to be saved you just annihilated your thought you don't realize that come on this is the biggest bunch of dummies I've ever seen in the message spiritually speaking sorry about that but how can you be on one side defense and on the other side of the fence I mean at least you could try to get them halfway and right he might wouldn't work of course there's no such thing all right look at the next one this is perseverance reaches 62 paragraph 24. 25 excuse me inside of Youth Avenue that's the same place that God set up every man from Adam Eve said will he will to live are you will to die neither one you want to if you're based on free more agency in whatever spirit that you let dominate you will bring forth the fruits your life will be dominated by the inside and faith so many people arrive on these five senses on the outside they're fine nothing against them if they agree with the Sixth Sense the soul the spirit only can be of two kinds and watch it can't be of two kinds gotta remember whatever you call it it's five senses of the body five cents to the second realm one sense or the center Rim which is either Faith or doubt it's not two kinds one of them is the spirit of God the other is the spirit of the devil you can't serve two masters at the same time you can't do it you're only given to one or you're holy given to the other and if you've got the spirit of God in you you've got faith and you'll believe every word that God wrote If you haven't and you might be look at Luke 16 what did Jesus say Luke 16 and 13. no servant can serve to Masters for he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and the world right is that that word Mana mailman you can't do it see then how can you howl the seed of God in you in any form as a reality and how the devil in at the same time because see people don't believe that the devil is their master I don't believe in one Ken folks the devil they believe there's one can force to God well you know according to the Branham brother Branham the Bible saying All Souls are mine and wrote around and said every person is a Son of God by creation every person in the world is the Son of God by creation because Satan can't create he can't create a soul he perverts the nature of your soul sure God brings your soul as perfect as could be I didn't say Eternal I said perfect when that baby comes but this world perverts the nature of that child now where is the seed put then if it's a literal form of a seed that's all I'm asking that's all I've ever asked look at this and about the black white bird Fellowship through the reconciliation of the blood preached in 19. 55. what a marvelous Victorious Life halfway life is the most miserable thing there is and by the way there's no such thing as a highly Christian you never seen one you never will did you ever see a black white bird at the same time did you ever see a drunk sober man no you never did see a sinner sign you're either a sinner or a saint you're on one side of the fence if you're born again you're saved if you're not born again you're outside of Christ without hope without God in the world God's made preparation for you to be saved okay look at this one message called Faith preached in 56. Jesus never preached a funeral right death and life can't stay together at the same time one more time I don't believe you come into the world with eternal life already in you I believe you must be born again to receive that eternal life and I don't believe there was some kind of a word or a seed put down in you I believe it was God's foreknowledge that he would predestinate you and I to be because of what he foreknew foresaw what you would want and what do you need a seed for I mean you don't never hear these priests with it why don't if people are going to preach all this about seeds and everything you never hear them preached like the prophet said like the Bible says the Bible says the angels are ministering Spirits what that's right to minister to who The Heirs of salvation you know Brother Dean when you was down there your sister or somebody or let's go to church going to church right it's kind of went to church how many angles does it take to get you there now if there are ministering Spirits or they just give to you right today you're born again or they would be following you all your life make up your mind which way it is if I was going to preach eternal life I'd really try to get into it great but you don't even hear him preaching that because they don't even know how to preach it that way but you see that angel could not save you remember we just put a sermon on that that brother Branham said the angel brought the message to Paul and to to uh ananias and to Peter Peter said that the Visions I didn't save nobody the seed comes through the body amen Angel come to Mary she said be it unto me according to Thy Word but the Bible says a holy ghost overshadowed her it was not an angel delivering the seed what's wrong with us folks you know but you're just too hard and Iran said I'll be glad to see a day when they come look people in the eyes say you're not preaching what Paul did I'll be glad to see a Time come in this message when some people stand up and looks the preachers in the eye and said that ain't right I know I'm a hateful old dude but you stand up in somebody's face and tell them it ain't right if I'm anywhere around there and I know you're right about what you're saying I'll be standing side of you so you just go ahead and tell him it ain't right and then just turn around step back and I'll just step up and we'll start talking would you do that brother Dale better believe I would you ought to yourself sure I was in a church and sit and listened to people crying crying and telling the brother that they knew when they got born again he said but you didn't get it that was his church and I walked out I had to leave because I told him when I left why I left and I said them people crying and talking to you about the the things the prophet said that he meant people with a holy ghost 50 years before him just like the day of Pentecost what is it how about this one as I thought on my way 1959 e79 number 14 brother I know let's go ahead and pick it up even what division was I know it was some kind of a power he's talking like that and you're looking at my hand and how it swales he saw these little white things run over my hand that's just like a vibration like a bird because the holy spirit's in you and death is on you listen and death and life excuse me and life and death cannot associate together now you go ahead and put them inside of you because if you're saying you come here with this spot already something physical something literal then you got God's word with the devil there go ahead questions and answers 1961. or 15. they must have blown out in there somewhere and thinking on that I was thinking of this that death is associated not with life life and death cannot exist at the same time and the trees have to how the South go out of them before that leaf can die on a tree so therefore death is associated you know what he's talking about I would think in the Realms of a human being death is associated with sin because before we had any sin we had no death at all but word there is death then there is sin and where there is sin there is death because death is results of sin and and then he that the soul that sinneth it shall die but when you're born again of the spirit of God we have eternal life and not associated anyway with death see death cannot associate with life life cannot associate with death uncertain sound 1961 eat 39. to the church the means are called out excuse me I was supposed to quote him the same ones I gave you want to go that two persons can't live in you at the same time you got to die out to the things of the world you can't serve God in Mammon it's as simple as I can be I've made myself blunt over 40 years than what I stick with and I believe it I believe you must be born again I believe you come into the world lost doomed and I mean you and brother random he said he was a hybrid you go check it out he told about him getting born again go check it out but yet we come up with a quote or something like I said about the little woman at the well you see that seed was laying there and brother Ryan says did as quick as it crossed and he come across and said he said it was quick in the Life what was Quicken that he was the Messiah what was quicker to the little lady back there when it was it Elijah it was quicker to her that her child would live after Elijah went you remember I'm not leaving you you going with me her confidence was in him being there when it was faith for the time a sinner can receive faith and be born again don't you believe that dinner can be healed how many do you want of this run around and said a sin across the platform and be healed he said in true Christian I was looking at him yesterday true Christians come across the platform maybe be delivered time they leave the platform it's done come back but to be healed is not a holy ghost revelation of a new birth you said well brother Dale what do you believe I'll get to it Sunday I believe that God by his own foreknowledge look down and seen who would be saved and who wouldn't and that he would assign an angel to go with you but the angel couldn't convert you the one brought around and talked to couldn't convert him and when you get around to saying it was Christ now you get in a different situation but remember he's a prophet ain't talking about me and you what I saw when I was 11 were 12 years old never converted me but I saw it you can take a lie detector's test I'll be glad to do it to see if one I saw was real to me but you see people believe that let's take a quote let us take thoughts they say well brother down I've always been talked to you as well it's about time to quit thinking like everybody and get down to thinking wait wait just a minute I could be wrong but no you ain't been in a good Baptist have you if I deny the father I'll be denying the son and if I deny the Holy Ghost I'll be denying God so I got to believe there's three gods I can't explain it so I'll say it three not in three persons Blessed Trinity if I say I ain't saved then I ain't saved let's grow some bread around him that says yeah right but you go back and check where he's putting it at you can be a justification and you can lose that part of your salvation that has started working and it can be taken away it was with Judas you can be at sanctification and lose that which you can't have the new birth and lose the new birth eternal life he said well why are you so hard these kids are sitting here you think they're not listening you think the kids out on the internet and things are not listening they've been taught that all they got to do is go to church and be good and believe the prophet brother Raymond was a prophet and they're automatically on their way to heaven because it always was eternal they ain't no denomination ever taught that bad that's a slang I know it I'm glad to say it they ain't a denomination in the world and I know of ever taught it that way even the Catholics going to put you through a ritual the bad news are going to get you baptized the message is going to sprinkle you a presbyterian is going to do their way right you gonna do something well we do oh we're not coming to work with eternal life so I don't have to worry about it I know I know I know that I'm not living too good I'm living like but one of these days one of these days I've changed you poor deceived hypocrite and them Hypocrites had taught you that way I'm not trying to build a kingdom I'm trying my best to say Souls to tell you the truth but if I become your enemy because I tell you the truth I'm sorry I told you there Sunday I dug a church out of going into adultery that they were already deciding who was going home with who to live with who and how polygamy and I told him it's wrong told him in a harsh way that's wrong but I become their enemy I won't apologize for for the truth I'll apologize to anybody for hurting her feelings or for saying something they didn't agree with I'm not going to apologize for the truth that's right I'm not going to do it I'm going to stand with it because I'll face it at judgment right but you know what you will face it too I believe what the prophet said I believe when he said eternal life begins right here at the altar and you show me that he wasn't right on up to the day that he died even up in the the communion which was the last message where he lays down our points you know that I'm not I find out I wasn't as soon as Charles and Ella Brown well I found out I wasn't a child a child of my mama and daddy sister Gail you find out by the new birth that you wasn't a child of them that ain't taken away from your mom and daddy bringing you here that's saying you wasn't of that that's the natural seed Abraham had a natural seed I'd read them today he said it was a natural Seed of Abraham named Isaac but he said there was a spiritual Seed of Abraham he said that's Christ is the Seed of Abraham that I'm concerned with right I love my Mom and Daddy and you know that do you know I'm not throwing off on nobody I'm just telling it like it is by being what we are we can claim our families right right now we don't believe in garbage cans We Believe In following the truth don't we but take on these things we'll take it up Sunday now let's run through a message we wrote around him on that message I've given you there at 154 the church age book where he said he didn't believe in that Mormon Doctrine he said it's not the person it comes predestinated eternally from God he said it's the cedar word so forget what you're looking at you can't have no predestination in what you're looking at all of it is going to have to be covered by foreknowledge even if he got any even if you're believing you come with eternal life you're still going to have to believe the body and things come by foreknowledge even if you think you always was eternal that need to be saved you still know you got to deal with this thing you take the doctrines that went that away and they've all went into adultery polygamies and times as I said a good denomination don't even do that Church we've heard the truth what are we going to do about it what are we going to do about it it ain't what everybody else is because I ain't concerned about everybody else I'm preaching to you if anybody else wants to listen that's up to them when I'm not their pastor huh I'm the pastor to those who call this their Church think on these things come on brother see we just play with words and quotes and ideas and thoughts you know just play with it I've been through all of it in this series over and over brother Ryan said if you have eternal life you always was eternal he said you were only in his thinking he said not your being here you were only in his thinking as far as God is concerned his thinking his reality but as far as we're concerned we've got to deal with this right Amen in Salvation and deliverance right as far as he's concerned it was over before the world right but now let me ask you a question I know I'm funny and I know I'm sorry but this is the way I think I ask you a question if there is a God that's not to me that's to you do you mean that he would allow 68 million people let me take Joe Lewis aside for a moment you remember that not the boxer Joe Lewis was another guy yeah he said how would he fold his arms and let them die by the Millions if he was God you remember that but around him said but he didn't understand the scripture he said because the scripture's got to be fulfilled the scripture says that you know that the seed had to go into the ground and come forth in a multiple form you realize if that church had to went into the ground down through them ages you and I wouldn't be here today I don't care what you think but you see Church you mean a great God would sit back with his arms folded and watch Millions killed he wasn't sitting back he was down there with him damn it who was it was it polycar no not probably car which one was it was it burned at the state polycar and the fire would bend away from him and said his soul was seen leaving in the form of a dove or right up through the Flames all of the things you want these quotes right around said sometimes they was put to sleep he said they didn't even feel that you believe that he didn't even feel it that's how loving God he was right there with him and they didn't even feel that sting of death It's a Wonderful savior let's stand 596.

Brother Gary and him had to leave her a while ago little Luke back there I prayed with him back in there in the nursery before we came out today and he was vomiting in zangs and and also you know let's just pray as we leave it the Lord will take care of the little fella and all it because that's that's a bad thing and you know we look at things a lot of times the wrong way and I don't like seeing a little kid vomit I don't like to see anybody vomit but I also know and realize that they stuff in that stomach sometimes need to be got out of there we went with Wade one time we've told you no he was running a high temperature I mean it just wouldn't and we missed church that day on account of him being you know so sick and and all and uh so we got a doctor's appointment and I was just praying and I was just young you know and the Lord and I said Lord we believe in doctors but just let everything before you touch that that doctor touch his Wade you let it all pass away I mean he was running high temperature he finally had average tonsils taken out into things you know but and we put ice around him you know and fixed him trying to help him we go up to the doctor's office and I don't understand her yet why that guy didn't get mad at a hornet but the doctor you know he met us there and he's a good doctor you know that was back when they'd meet you he met us at the office we walked in and just as we walked into the door and he started saying something to us and about that time we let it go and he just covered the place up vomiting you know and the doctor said well we'll do what we can for him but said it's all right everything's gone that's just the way he said it he says okay it's gone and you know what temperature and he said well Doctrine you know he gave him some medicine that's good because he just believe in him and him a little bit they can't believe sometimes for themselves so let's believe for them you know and just just remember these all right anything remember the fellowship meeting now and I say again if you're going please let us know do you the ones that are not here tonight if you're going to let us know because we're not going to sit and wait on you paste the time and we need to know before the time to where we can make arrangements you know if not then you can drive I don't have any problems and I'll give you money to buy the gas no problem but you just stop us from the doings because we have a set schedule and to go as far as we have to go over the mountains and think it just takes a long time takes a good three hours of hard driving to get there through the mountains you know it's not Interstate it's through the mountains so just you that are going if you're not going call us because if we're sitting there you know in our way in June's not going to go and you know I use them because I had no feelings about the rest of you and he don't call us we could leave at 9 30 because everybody's ready but he's I don't know I'm going or not I'll make up mine a little while the world don't evolve around me and you I like the way right around and said it he said if you think you're important take some water in a bowl and stick your finger in it and pull it out and find a hole that's how much we're thought of but yet we do everything we can to to help you in any way and do it but just remember that now leaving 10 o'clock okay all right Lord Jesus we love you we thank you for tonight we pray that what we've said would be acceptable in thy sight and Lord it's what we believe because it's what we've always believed about you that you didn't just drop mankind down on Earth and sling out a bunch of seed and let it fall you knew where that seed would fall in that little woman the prophet said but you knew she would say we know when the Messiah cometh and that was her connection because somebody had taught her that even till your Prophet was saying about the Virgin Mary there and her saying that she heard from her mother but then one day it was quickened a virgin shall conceive and she said that's that scripture and she believed it we thank you for your love and your grace unto us and we pray that you'd bless everybody on the way home give a safe journey give Journeys Mercy to these that are traveling like dick and Gail into different things Lord this coming weekend and I'll just bless each one we love you and we thank you in Jesus name you're dismissed Blessed Be the work of myself
