everybody in the house of the Lord if you like turning your scriptures turn to Matthew 24 and Revelations 8 Matthew 24 Revelations 8 remember the Bible study will be the first Saturday in June all right I had that one wrote I should remember that and uh remember now the announcements is downstairs to all of the brothers that wanting to go to the uh Father's Day fishing trip you don't have to be that it's just all the brothers are invited to come you know and go with us it has a list of things to make sure you bring you know and all and to be downstairs and things that you are going to do and like need some volunteering around the camp you know to do different things so you read that there's one thing that should have been circled real good it says to make sure and bring earplugs because some of the brothers in the big tent yeah yeah you can't tell the difference of whether the buyers in the woods is making the racket or and I really think that that's why they don't bother us too much because the snoring is so loud until the little bears are afraid of the what they think is the Big Bear but it'll be downstairs it's there and just write that down or get it and read it and see what it's doing but now let's see if we can get through today and then we'll have some comments and questions if not we'll continue on into Wednesday night but I want you to to see this and to see what I'm saying it's like I've always said I've never asked anybody to believe what I've said I ask you to pray about it seek the Lord about it and let the Lord speak to you because I can't reveal it to you anyway I can only do as the prophet said stir up the part of you to where that the Holy Spirit then can speak to you and to reveal his word to you so let's pray Lord Jesus we thank you for all things we ask you now just guide us be with us as we Endeavor to speak about you Lord we ask you to come on the scene and manifest yourself through the opening of your word and that's not a problem to ask because you promised it and Lord we believe you and we thank you and we just ask you to have your way with us and let your love Lord be with each and every one of us touch the sick because you promised it and Lord those that are not here today the sicknesses and things we ask you to take it away and father just bless each one have your way we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Matthew 24. very familiar Parts with each one of us in Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the Temple and Jesus said unto them see you know all these things verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as you set up on the Mount of Olives the disciples came into him privately saying tell us when shall these things be not one stone left on another right and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world all right let's go over to Revelations 8 1. and just read that one part there and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour you may be seated Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now not much of a background but always try to background the previous message and then try to continue on so we are talking about the coming of the Lord in talking about the coming of the Lord in the bases that's related to The Bride of Jesus Christ we are not talking about to coming to Israel we're not talking about an ending of the world Etc but we're talking about the coming of the Lord to the bride and the prophet said that he came he comes three times or three advents he said first one was he came to redeem his bride we know that has already transpired he comes the next time to catch his bride away that is the part that we are in now and then the third part is he we will come back with him in the millennial reign so then we're not to be concerned with the first part it's already finished the life's part that is coming there's no need to worry about it but as I said this morning those things are points of tantalizing thoughts that we wonder what's going on will it be babies born in the Millennium will it be this will it be that what good would it do if we knew that would it satisfy your ego you know I mean are we going to still have an ego when we get over I told you you just didn't listen to me I don't think that's going to be the situation you may but I don't think so I think it'll be a joyous time and we're going to be worried about it all right but now then we're not to be concerned with any other thing than the hour that we're living and I've tried my best for 40 something years to get you to see the day that we're living it's been my whole goal not to worry about that not to worry about the future but worry about what is right here now because it is the only part that will do us any good at this time you know is to talk about where we are now we have been into the thing the word that we understand that God sent a prophet he brought a message unto us we believe that was the Lord descending from heaven with a shout all right we believe that we're not looking for another Prophet to come to straighten this Prophet out or any other individual to straighten him out because you know that's your problem if you think you can you just better keep on going on down the road it could be very dangerous people don't realize what they're playing with they're playing with the very word of God in in a greater respect than even the the time of the Lord Jesus because he said if you say one word against the son of man it can be forgiven you all right but he said when he the Holy Ghost has come see one word will not be forgiven in this world or the world to come so then we better be careful how we approach things and what we do all right so the hour that you and I are living the time we're here and I keep expressing it because that's what I want the Catholic Church never got upset about Luther when he nailed his thesis to the door that didn't upset them but when the people begin to believe what Luther said they were losing a lot of Converse and they become very upset so they went after the uh one who brought the message a lot if you can't see that's where we're at now that you know right as I was saying this morning then here is the prophet's message that wasn't arguing much while he was here a few things in doctrinal issues come along after he was here but the main thing is right now that they're trying their best to destroy the credibility of the messenger and if they can do that they can destroy the credibility of the message in the minds of the people and you can say it doesn't bother me what they say well I'm honest to tell you it does bother me maybe not in the point of getting caught with their Doctrine but it bothers me because I know what it will do to the people it has destroyed the credibility of the message and really you don't understand what that means because if you can destroy the credibility of the message or what big words you want to use to put in there you know I'm not too good on there that but if you can destroy the credibility of this message then you have automatically destroyed the credibility of your Bible no I believe the Bible I just don't believe right around him probably now see there's no way to separate it see you and I don't realize what we've had no age has ever had even in the days of the Apostles even with a great ability Paul in the doings get on there a minute writing of Paul was probably all that was captured you know and looking this time then we can not only here the voice of the seventh angel we can do it see some of these are smart enough to do it I'm just barely catching home everybody laughs at my cut and tight and Joe dims got it back there if they want to stick it out here we can see it I cut out a quote not I give you the whole quote but then I cut it out instead of trying to use the computer because I ain't that smart but I still get the message across from what I want and give you the whole quote all right would you think about what you and I have had we have the ability to uh forgive me for a lack of words question the prophet asked to uh well I mean by that is say brother random what is a new birth didn't even go to Christ the mystery God reveal and that's what he said he said what is the new birth he said it's a revelation Jesus Christ personally to you well there's your answer well I'd sure like to ask him about that what would he say you remember how I was illustrating it Paul wrote penned it wrote himself shall descend from heaven with a shout for some Archangel trumpet I believe Paul saw that go to prophets these things and if you'd walked up to Paul and said Paul what did you mean he said what do you mean what did I mean I said what I meant see we had it interpreted the big Shout Dark Angel the trumpet that wasn't what Paul said you know what Paul said you remember what I was ran Paul said what brought around said in Christ in the future write your message when he said Jesus does all three of these in his descending that was what Paul said amen amen yeah we took 2 000 years to try to figure that out instead of believing we'll say it We can question the prophet not as a question would ask him for the answer and and you can pretty well get your answer all right I know what everybody then says well that's your way of looking at it your way of looking at it well if I can say what he said then I don't have to worry about the rest of it and I don't have to back off to say I believe this amount but I don't believe disallowed I believe what he said and I try my best to stay with that all right now then let's let the prophet try to explain were you and I are at right now because we're not in the future we're not in the past we're here now and I think it's about time to wake up and begin to believe what has been said instead of running around horrib we've had about 40 something years to run around horrible you know and uh you know trying to I reckon make an impression or something but what have we done we run around horrible what are we doing we got tired that's about the best thing you can say because what's people doing now going out of the message me what did Brother Brown say to the two great things to God was his hindrance sight time that's the two greatest hindrance God has because of sight and time first everybody wants to see it second well maybe that's a coming well see then that's our problem then we can't take Hebrews 13 8. and stay with it being the same yesterday today and forever now this morning we were talking about it and I said I was laying down a way to come to this evening about the coming of the Lord to you and I I believe the coming of the Lord to the bride is the revealing of God's word because it's not a physical thing we meet him in the air so it would have to be then him descending by way of the prophet to bring us the message to speak unto us and be the voice you know and then when it would be that then we can just depend upon what he's saying all right I believe you and I have heard the shout the prophet's message I believe the voice of the Archangel which would be the Lord Jesus Christ that brought around and said he that same voice would raise the Dead I believe he will be here in the bride so much until she will be the fullness of the godhead bodily until she will be the son of man the word made flesh well I sure don't see it you wouldn't have seen it back there how would you even when people now quote wrote around him he said more in one service in his ministry than is written in the Bible one service more things took place now you take the entire Bible of the New Testament part writings and you take all of the accounts of over the period of time and how long it took and you put down and they wouldn't be a miracle done but about once every two weeks or maybe more if you took time put it with it run we look at it as like something happening every day and I believe it did but I'm just expressing it that's why I'm running around could say more in one service than in Jesus the entire Ministry written well they didn't believe him they didn't believe the prophet he did that ain't got nothing to do with me and you so what is now the coming of the Lord to the Bride of Jesus Christ through Jesus does all three the shout the voice of an archangel and the trumpet and we went through that here a while back and earlier a few Services ago and showing it the brother random says in the ten virgins 1960. he's talking about the hinder those that are asleep for the trumpet will sound something will take place the gospel trumpet and we owned paragraph 141. the gospel trumpet will sound the announcing of his coming right you remember the quote I gave you one day where brought around and said we will never be gathered together until the resurrection see we think we're going to get together he said we'll never be gathered until the resurrection because that's even sensible because we're still here scattered all over but the announcing of his coming the gospel trumpet my brother Dan I talked to trumpet would call us up we can't be called up until the Resurrection comes that's sensible that doesn't need a great big light bulb turned on doesn't it all right what's the next order Resurrection but we've done heard the message right I believe in this message is the shout the voice of the archangel and the trumpet if you're not going to be called together it's this message it's going to call us together you know but I'm still expecting it yeah that's that ain't gonna change you like I told you there used to be a time when people would run and jump about things but and I was reluctant to even mention the dead being raised because I didn't want the building filled up they may not have to buy another get another building see now you can talk about how you want to it don't increase at all see they don't believe it right I don't believe it you mean it could be a case that you and I could come they would be setting and abused but still not believe remember this morning that the prophet said what Rapture would take place people will go right on thinking they're getting the Holy Ghost I told you 40 something years ago what I believed what happened I'm as serious as can be about it I believe there will be a great smooth a great sweep of the Holy Spirit through the land right at the time but you know what as it sweeps among the bride it will also sweep among the world because the third pool is for the bride to the church for the bride and the church into the totally lost I believe there'll be a great moving Revival I've always believed that but you see I can also then turn around and say like brother is it Boaz um Jose that said brother random said the Lord told me there'd be a Revival in New York he said it's already come you didn't know it so then I'm not making that I've got to be wait till the great Revival comes before I can think I want to be ready every day but I believe you and I are missing the things that we should be looking at all right what is then brother Branham the coming of the Lord they were talking about remember coming of the Lord to the bride I keep saying that because you'd be surprised what them computers in brains them brains that you've got and I can say something and it'll cut off or you can go to sleep and you don't get it and then you think I said something that I didn't say that's why we take the tapes always have because they're there so you can show what I've done or but I'm also show you that I didn't do it all right because there's no way to listen when you're asleep there's no way to listen if you're thinking about what you're going to do when you get home this evening I mean you left the beans burning on the stove this morning don't worry about it your house is already burnt down just a little bit to shake us not talking about the coming of the Lord to the Jews not talking about the first stage of the coming of the Lord the life stage of the coming of the Lord first stage being 2 000 years ago my stage being in the millennium we're talking about what's going on and I said it this morning it's what I've always said and you tell me what else it is the coming of the Lord is the revealing of his word is the one thing that Satan cannot impersonate is that the wage of the prophet it can impersonate any gift any sign any Wonder but he can't bring the word word by word well Jesus never used any gift to conquer him we were listening to a type the other night right around said Jesus wouldn't even listen to him when the sake was talking to him I mean that was how much he was paraphrasing how much it was so you know Satan was trying to get him to you know cast your foot down he said he wasn't even listening to it see because what he knew what the word said I don't know I think you and I were to be open down to the place of getting to listening to the word Anyway by now not brother Branham would you talk to us a little bit about the coming of the Lord in relationship to some of the things you spoke of in your ministry go ahead to number two brother they go to Christ the Mr God reveal paragraph 106 and 107. God's Great mixture of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it now what's he talking about what's the thing the Angels didn't know that Jesus said he said even I don't know about his coming right all right that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see God has this all to himself it's a secret that's the reason there was silence in heaven first place of half an hour what's the reason there were silence nobody used to know anything about his coming right see and that's the reason they were shot well of course if anything been said or anything happened he would give away the secret right in heaven first place of half hour and seven Thunders uttered the voices and John was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the Lord does that need a great big ball of lightning to strike but around what is the coming of the lord it's the seventh seal what is the coming of the Lord is the secret coming of the Lord Jesus Christ it's the thing he didn't even know himself when he would come that's the one thing he can't one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he'll come it's a good thing he doesn't no now you can translate that no to k-n-o-w remote and I discussed this 40 something years ago you can translate that to no I asked to k-n-o-w as to nobody is to know or you can translate it or it's a good thing that he doesn't stop pause no if you did you're gonna put your nose down here see that's where they wasn't maybe following the point how are you going to translate what he said it's a thing they don't know either way is right all right she has showed now what he's coming he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible okay therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ amen the entire Bible is expression a one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible was what was God's purpose the thing he wanted to achieve I thought the prophet said that it was to reveal himself to mankind I thought that was the goal the thing that God wanted was to reveal reveal himself to the creation he made I you know I'm sorry if I missed that one but what is it because the entire Bible is expressing one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts are the Believers in the Bible has been in type and expressing what God's Great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and God's help will we you'll see it right here this morning what the Lord had in his mind all along and has expressed it he's putting that in the seventh sealants what he's bringing he's coming yeah but it's silence in heaven first place a half hour how long do I have how long see you don't blinked your mind you want to know how long that is or what it's going to be like the seven Thunders he said in the seal book about 158 perfect but it's pretty close it's in the first seal he said the Thunder's the voice of God when the seal breaks but you know what they've done in this message they picked out some brothers and they made brother so and so Thunder number one and brother so and so Thunder number two that one tickled me to death gonna happen to know a few of them that I care much about their Thunder you know I thought some of it was a lot of thunder no I'm not making a lot of them it's down like a like I believe it you know but you see we read what the prophet has said and he said the entire Bible was revealing God's hidden Mystery all right so if it is the coming of the Lord then he's been coming for six thousand years four thousand to get him here in the person of Jesus Christ two thousand to get him here and the Believers of the end time and all down to the ages you know see there was silence in heaven well okay now what is silence in heaven I can't hold my breath for half an hour and you'd get upset if I held my speaking for an half an hour illustrate but I hope you see what I mean and the prophet didn't say there wasn't something going on come on he read your silver he said they stand in awe who stands in all a-w-e every how you pronounce it somebody's seen it yeah but none of this that Daniel heard the Thunders am I quoting wrote about him John heard the Thunders am I quoting brother but they were forbidden to write it what the coming of the Lord well because the prophet said if they did Satan get a hold of it and it certainly wouldn't be silenced then what you were talking about the part of his coming to the bride in the part of receiving his bride or getting her ready you know then we can read what he has to say go ahead with number four remember in this parties to come to receive he came to redeem then he's coming to receive souls in prison now 63. paragraph 155. now he's coming to receive what he has redeemed that's his work he's done he's coming to receive it oh what what a Time he has proven it the seventh seal proved it come back and took the book of redemption well there's nothing going on brother Dale you said it a minute ago no I didn't say it a minute ago I said this silence I said your Prophet said they stand in awe and what's taking place riches haven't seal so then who's going to take the book of redemption to get among the people of the message their literal splits over one group saying the seventh seals broke the other group said the Seven Seals not broke which group are you in I'm asking a simple question you're going to be on one side or the other right well I really don't know well that's put you in the middle I guess he said well I can read your words to open unread you where it's not open we just read in the Bible in Revelations 8 1 that the lamb broke or opened the seventh seal the fact of telling it was silence means the author is in in saying that if nothing else the silence in heaven is enough to know that is opened well why did he well let's we'll read some quotes the seventh seal will never be made known to the public can't be you can't make the new birth known to the public right go out and tell the world are you born again I don't care what you talk they can't see it until they get born again you see what I'm talking about he says the seventh seal proves it it come back and took the book all right there's really no argument where the book's opened or not something being opened doesn't mean that it's revealed it was open to Daniel but he said seal it up it opened to John but he said seal it up all right what about you and I what is then this seventh seal he said now he is coming the hour of his coming you know he said Dar what would be the sign of the coming of the end of the world is coming all right look back before the seals broke 62. message called hey God well wait a minute let's drop back to five yeah going back to let's use five which is the seventh see you're not is paragraph 3 97 now we have in the completion here now by the grace of God all the ministry of the six sealed has been sealed up and we understand and know that the seventh seal is not to be known to the public I understand that he's coming and the hour of his coming winter destruction of the world and that's the intra you know he said what would be the sign of the coming of the end of the world in Matthew 24. that's where they ask him the questions I wrote it on up when you see this coming to past and no the time is nah see Israel's gathering in his own Homeland but you notice he omitted to revelation of this seventh seal and you're when the seventh seal when he opened it he also had omitted it again so we see that it's a complete mystery therefore the hour is not yet for these mystery to be known therefore we're this far and the rest of it will be known right around about the time that Jesus appears on Earth again for his right or whatever takes place at that time now until that time let's just all pray and live be a good Christian why because there's no way you're going to figure it out you can't figure it out amen you can't figure out the new birth if you don't have it you don't know what it is yet you can quote all the quotes but if you've never experienced it it's no good all right go on to the next one then like I said I got number six all right 35 the holy spirit always speaks of the word I've got many things to tell you you could not understand it now but when he comes he'll guide you to it that's the reason the coming of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God should be finished to know who God is what he is how he lives his nature his being you're supposed to be all the way up here by that time he bringing us into the full stature of the Sons and Daughters of God a church that's washed in the blood of Jesus Christ that's bought without money is paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ all right look at the next one this is the first seal paragraph 171. I don't don't tell this just what it is you know we stand in what is you know the Lambs showing John he said now this is just what this is now what's under this seventh seal don't don't go down and tell that or if I tell John that then all down through the age the whole plan will be broke it's a secrecy he just wants to he's coming he said uh nobody's going to know when I'm coming I'm just coming see that's all it ain't for my it ain't for my business to know when I just want to be ready amen what about it what do you think about it what about this great mystery what is it well I left one of the papers in the office did you know this quote he said there was no need of writing it got it laying in my office and our artists didn't bring it you know why that the seventh seal was not written now we know and we've just read he would let out the mystery and no one was to know when he's coming but he said there was no need of us knowing it you know why he said because there's going to be a Prophet come right the word of the Lord comes to the prophet there's no need of writing it because you're going to stumble all over it they've done a bad enough job stumbling over it messing us up in our thinking but God sent a prophet that he could speak to and he could tell you what it is and what's going on but look at what he's saying so we're going to have to depend on him to understand what does he say it is what does he say the seventh seal is go to number 13 brother we'll jump over Feast of the trumpets paragraph 175. he's bringing it down and what does he say the seventh seal hasn't opened yet you know that she's coming how more simple could you get a random one is the seventh seal that's just coming what simpler could you make it look what he says on the next one this is that was paragraph 175. look at 246 the Feast of the trumpet Pentecost Feast finished at the period of the seventh trumpet for the next is the coming of the seventh seal for the next is the mystery of the coming of Christ and also the trumpet is sound for the Jews the six he'll finish the mystery under the seal just before the Sabbath is open there was no need to write it because first off nobody could understand what was written now 40 something years of preaching about it I ask you the question do you think run around them could tell you something that Jesus couldn't tell you if you do you're putting a mighty a lot of hopes on and you're getting close to deity very close he said yeah but he could be waiting no because Jesus didn't know when he was coming you see what is the seventh sealed in it says coming the very thing that we've missed and yet we've read about it for 40 something years simple little point of his coming I ask you to look up the word come okay I found this one they don't have it back there but questions and answers on the seals paragraph 66. now we find that the corruption that hit in the seventh Church age but the seventh seal doesn't reveal anything what's going to happen to it because at the end of that church age is to come a prophetic gift to reveal these things he are you following it a prophetic gift to all of my Independence is upon one thing is whether or not that Prophet knew what he's talking about but knew what he's talking about for our age and our time and brother random what is seven seal this is taken from 229 of the seventh seal message we must remember that the seventh seal is the end of all things things written in the seven seal book sealed up of the Plan of Redemption and the founders of the world every bit ends did you ever go look up the word end did you ever look up the word come summer grin ain't shaking their heads I guess he read the definition was you listening to the words the word come means to be here that's literally what it means so you're thinking of the word comments some form of travel some form of doing and I would say to you I'd say oh no brother Marlow you and sister Marlow come to see us we say to you that means you've got to travel to me it doesn't mean that I'm not concerned with your traveling I'm warning you in my presence that's where I differed with the perusia parsia brothers because I said it means in his presence I said a God standing beside heavy you'll have to kill you right any of us goody goody enough that we'd like to stand in his presence for a little while they said brother Jack Cole and brother Tatum used to tell about brother George and him little brother Jack Coley pretty bad call out things and they said he'd start calling out a few things and the line that just start dropping out people come to be prayed for but they didn't want their life revealed you see what about you and I that we want our life revealed peruzia parsia means his presence it also means the presence of the Antichrist because it's the same word used for him well do you think the Antichrist is in you rather not be nobody's present right and you tell me the devil ain't got nothing to do with me I tell you no that's right he's already got you solved a problem because the devil had a lot to do with Jesus in the bases that he could tempt him right but then one day he turned around he says he don't have nothing to do with me evidently things are going to cut off about that time he said he don't have nothing to do with me and I don't know how to do with him so brother random said the seventh seal is the coming of the Lord that's his coming he said all right and if this is coming then he's not traveling that's where we get in those big words see we want to do what we don't think the word come means to appear or to be there but in scriptural terms the new birth is not just a presence of something with you you agree with that you did this morning somebody you shook your head anyway a little bit this morning the new birth is not just God standing beside of you that is known you birth the new birth that started the coming of the Lord to you was God coming in you do you agree with that amen within his second coming would not be something exterior it'd be the revealing of his word so as you start with a new birth how do you get virtue well I just need it so I just go get it I'll buy it knowledge tempers no takes a revealing of his word everyone says you birthed into this birthed into this birth into this statue of perfect man right it means of coming forth into the new birth put Christ in you Paul said the hope of glory not Christ beside of you so what would be his second coming it would have to be dealing with an inside is that simple language everybody says I'm so deep I get so tickled in people's terminologies brother Dale is so deep I can't understand him can't understand it your new birth puts Christ in you what would be the coming of the Lord excuse me anything up what started see that couldn't be done you know what brother run said these virtues are required it took him 30 something years he said before he could preach and you know what he said he said these the Thunders will bring the virtues that's why you started that seventh anniversary Doctrine Back Down Yonder of course that man had it all figured out he's going to tell you when you got one he's going to tell you when you got two he's going to tell you when the next virtue came he's going to tell you that what are you thinking about on this coming what are you looking for well brother Dale I'm looking for well she said well I go a great move to come I'm looking for that too but around said God will do in one year what theologists theologians are when he used the word would do in 2000 years but you don't go to arrest him but say he's doing it now that's questions and answers he's doing it now what's going to bring the virtues I asked brother moat that question 40 years ago what's going to bring to virtues the Lord spoke to me one day and said the opening of the word will bring it because the virtues will come into being as the voice of God is spoken unto you and I and revealing his word to you and I wouldn't that be his coming that's more simple can you get all right so the seventh seal is the coming of the Lord the coming of the Lord has always been a secret it's the one thing Satan cannot impersonate he don't know how to impersonate it yeah but what about the quote word ain't broke yet okay I just read one where he said it can never be made known to the public there are things about it we were talking at lunch while ago about this coming that I'm talking about there's things that hasn't taken place yet the coming of the Lord will consummate to you and I in the basis of the Dead being raised that hasn't taken place yet that's why brother Brandon would say in one sentence he's here and he said I'm looking for his coming we were talking about how he would stand there and he said you know what I'm doing I'm waiting on him well he had the Holy Ghost Inside of him who was he waiting on he's waiting on a personal presence amen different from that new birth they're not different but yet something that would show him these things it's a new birth would not show him the coming of the Lord is revealing of his word has he revealed to you his coming are you still looking for it the random said the biggest force in the Old Testament was fulfilled in the Life scriptures and prophecies with the last few hours on the cross could it end that way again let me go back about 40 years ago to some statements I made as I started off while ago talking about it I don't believe brother Branham could tell us something that Jesus couldn't tell us I believe Jesus told us that's the reason brother random could tell us Jesus preached six seals in Matthew 24. he omitted the seventh you know what because that's who he was is that simple enough he was the seventh that was his coming right come on how many times I've made this statement he comes first time redeem is bright second time with his bride you know I mean just catch his right away third time with his pride so when Jesus Christ stood on this earth right there was that seventh seal standing there amen God himself in human flesh that's why he didn't talk about his coming right you know why Jesus didn't talk about his coming because he was Hebrews 13 8. right he knew who he was and what was going on he never he didn't know the day in the hour that he was coming no ours brought around and said that coming would be completed to make sure to get it right when what are you saying Jesus didn't know when he was coming physically because he was a human man standing there that that human man said I do nothing until the father shows me where was the father I thought he said unless you believe that I am healed on your sin so I thought the father was in him but that flesh man outside there was not eternal that's our problems right now our problem is in our brain and our spirit our human part of us is not eternal that's our problem when that becomes Eternal we won't have any trouble but until then we got troubles Paul said the thing I would I would not think I'd do it he said then what is it he said within the law of My Flesh right one part of me I serve God another part of me I serve the flesh um but when you quote that Jesus said all power is given unto me in heaven and earth how many of you know that was written after his resurrection read your Bible he never said that when he was on Earth because he had to wait on the father to move him I do nothing until the father shows me when he come to that him and the father had come back to being totally won what is the coming of the Lord Brother Dale I believe it's the revealing of God's word and that's why I pray and study listen to tapes do the best I can love to deer hunt when I go down in the woods and I put a brother's here fix me up a thing and I put it on there and I've listened to three tapes sitting on deer stand actually that cycle right through I've slept through some of them problems telling you I slept through some of them I do pretty good I tie myself to the tree but I've slept through tapes yeah but I've also heard it over and over I told you about how that we listened to the unveiling of God five days in a row going to work the fifth day it hit me he said I come in three sons names son of a man Son of God Son of David and after all that listening it struck me what he was saying Son of God her son of man in life died Rose Son of God you can't go from Son of God to the son of David he had to come back in the end time as son of man right what a wonderful Bible you and I have for a message that we've got the answer that Satan don't like amen Satan don't care how much you listen to tapes he don't care how much you pray he don't care how much you shout how much you cry how much you do anything all he's trying to do is keep you from believing Who You Are did the prophet time I want to go did the prophet say when the bride realizes who she is she'll be gone she'd be an invincible Army when she realizes who she is what do you think brother random could have so much Authority and thing he knew who he was he wasn't looking for the coming of the Lord he knew the Lord was right there right I'm not looking for the coming of the Lord I'm looking at the coming of the Lord which is the revealing of his word and to me that's the great seventh seal that is a mystery it's not some Secret down underneath come on I've always it's been straight forward with you I tell you my faults and my favors I first went to Jeffersonville Indiana I looked up there and I saw a cross and Down Under that cross was i n r i wrote that down there's a new name there's a new name INRI now all I got to know is what that means I come outside to brother mode I said brother MO would you mind telling me something I didn't tell him you know what I was thinking about I said would you mind telling me what it means i n r i he said Jesus Christ King of the Jews I wasn't dumb enough to tell him what I was thinking but see we're all human rights we've tried to figure out things try to do things but why not just make it simple and see what the prophet has to say that the seventh seal is the coming of the Lord and realize that we're not dealing with that back fairness over here so he's coming as he reveals his self the great headstone that we've looked to come the Priestess 40 something years to you I believe that headstone is this message amen this message revealed to you and I is the headstone but it was what Jesus preached because right around him never added one word to what Jesus had to say now if you did then the Bible is against him because it says you can't add a word or take a word out you better watch what you're saying he broke down into human language what the Bible was saying but he never told us something that Jesus couldn't tell us so with Eric stood in Matthew 24 he preached six sealed he didn't have to preach the seventh that's who he was he was standing there when the prophet finished them seals he said he's here he said as great as he's ever been outside of the Corporal body what do you think come on brothers what do you think he said well you told us about the word come but you didn't tell us about the word end because brother Branham wouldn't run around and said the seventh seal is the end of all things I went home I got a dictionary and I looked up the word e and D how many of you ever looked it up the word e n d end see we think in means you come out you fell off her cliff that's the end the Bible says the end of all things has come upon us back there they could say the end of all things 2 000 years ago they could say the end of all things the word in doesn't mean cut off point if you'll take one simple example and think about it when you're walking up a set of steps you take the first step what is the end of the first step he said what are you kicking them back okay that's the foundation for the next one right the end of the first step is the second step you don't annihilate it the end of the second step is the third what did Brother Brown say the end of the first seal what's the end of the first seal the opening of the second one how much simpler can anybody make it the end of the first seal is the opening and of the second one so the end of The Sixth Seal would have been the opening of the seventh which means he's here he's not coming come doesn't mean that way look it up literally come means to be and like I've tried to express it I'm home I'm away and I come home to my wife I don't come home to my wife to walk in and say hi honey got supper ready I know I've been gone a month where is my wife she's in my arms there's your word come it literally means to be enguffed into what you're doing you have reached your goal you have reached your your point you traveled into my house nothing to do with it it's when you stand in my house your coming is finished the end not falling off a cliff in the Bible nothing ever ends the devil and all that does yeah but we don't talk about that the end of this world will be the beginning of Eternity you agree with that you see how simple it is if you think the end of this world is the beginning of Eternity but Iran said it's the end of all times he said it even ends at Sabbath seal he says like a Roman Candle that goes up and shoots out shoots out you better remember one thing our term of a Roman Candle only has seven or eight blacks to it right you ever shot a Roman Candle he'd shoot so many times and it Fizzles out not showing the gospel well the randomly is using that only to illustrate and it goes up and blinds out keeps opening each one of those keeps opening he's explaining it like the ripples on the ocean she toss a rock into a lake and the ripples never stop they go to the bank and they come back right the end of all things is come upon us I think it's really should be the end of our thinking would be the grass go ahead brother let's stand I hope you understand what I mean I didn't have no time for questions we'll take that Wednesday noted already 20 minutes till four we'll have questions and answers Wednesday what about the coming of the Lord I'm enjoying it this is that was spoken of by the Bible it's coming right now I know you're going to misunderstand it make me
