[13:54] we uh still expecting another full house
[13:56] you
[13:57] um by way of announcements we need to if
[13:59] anybody has any more names to go on that
[14:01] list that we're doing
[14:03] uh for the uh people that are
[14:06] that are seeking the baptism of the holy
[14:08] ghost or seeking salvation
[14:10] um then you need to add it to that list
[14:13] get with brother joe
[14:14] don't just come up and tell me to put
[14:16] somebody on the list
[14:18] that's like telling that drum to play
[14:20] itself
[14:22] it ain't going to happen write it down
[14:26] that you don't have to aim man too loud
[14:27] brother
[14:29] you know uh the old saying is the the
[14:32] shortest pencil is greater than the
[14:33] longest memory
[14:35] so write it down and give it to me or
[14:37] write it down and give it to brother joe
[14:38] he's compiling them in the back now so
[14:41] uh
[14:42] just uh lord bless each and every one of
[14:44] you we love all of our families
[14:47] and we want them to see this wonderful
[14:48] gospel but you know there was one time
[14:51] we didn't see this wonderful gospel
[14:53] it was one time we were out in sin we
[14:54] thought we had it all made we
[14:56] we thought we were the ones that were in
[14:58] control but uh
[15:00] sometimes god has a way of getting your
[15:02] attention
[15:04] and like brotherdale was preaching this
[15:06] morning he is
[15:08] out to seek each and every one of us
[15:11] he's out to seek
[15:12] seek the lost and that should be our
[15:16] goal
[15:16] brother brown said when you lose that
[15:18] zeal for lost souls
[15:20] he said i doubt your experience all
[15:23] right so if you have your bibles let's
[15:24] turn to the first corinthians
[15:26] chapter 13 we had a wonderful time over
[15:28] in alabama
[15:29] i had a good trip and i want to
[15:32] appreciate all that pray for us and
[15:34] all that that we're concerned
[15:38] about what we were doing and having fun
[15:41] and
[15:41] like dad said we were i thank them for
[15:43] letting me preach this afternoon other
[15:45] than he just told me this a day and a
[15:47] half ago
[15:48] out in the woods so the only time i had
[15:51] to prepare was this morning but uh
[15:54] we had a good time but i said well thank
[15:56] you because i get to stand up
[15:58] because we've been sitting down a lot
[16:00] for a week so
[16:02] so we uh but we had a good time now by
[16:04] way of announcement
[16:05] taxes are announced february the 18th is
[16:08] going to be
[16:09] the um
[16:12] sweethearts banquet that's correct
[16:16] and then i had asked i know some of you
[16:20] wondered why i won't ask to speak
[16:22] because the lord's been putting
[16:23] something on my heart and
[16:24] i've been working on it i say we me and
[16:27] the lord's only two that's been in that
[16:28] deer
[16:28] in that deer in that box for four days
[16:31] so
[16:32] well i know the devil was there too but
[16:34] uh we were not going to try to let them
[16:36] have precedence over what we were
[16:37] talking about so
[16:39] but uh it's been laid on my heart
[16:42] several things about the family
[16:45] we've got new families we've got older
[16:46] families we've got
[16:48] families that we want to come in we've
[16:51] got families that are not you know that
[16:52] are broken and separated and all those
[16:54] things and
[16:55] and we're just going to take that day
[16:58] and
[16:58] well tonight today we're going to start
[17:00] on try to get your mind a little bit on
[17:03] the word love and that's where we're
[17:05] going to start first corinthians 13
[17:07] chapter 13 and see what paul said about
[17:09] charity
[17:11] but after that we speak on the uh
[17:14] banquet there then i asked that if i
[17:17] could have maybe
[17:18] several sundays so i'm going to take
[17:20] several sundays
[17:22] on family matters and it'll be pretty
[17:25] straightforward
[17:26] uh you're not going to like some of the
[17:28] quotes it's not mine it's your profits
[17:30] we're going to find out if you really
[17:31] believe brother brown to be a prophet or
[17:32] not
[17:33] we're going to really when you start
[17:35] seeing some of the things that goes on
[17:36] you know we just live in one big family
[17:38] this is a family you know you my my
[17:40] life's an open book to you guys and
[17:42] and a lot of you tell us a lot of things
[17:44] that you do and all that so we're just
[17:45] kind of all family
[17:47] but there are some things that if we're
[17:49] going to that i feel if we're going to
[17:52] move on with god the same burden that i
[17:54] had for all the people that are not here
[17:56] when i look around see
[17:57] some of your children are not here and i
[17:58] look around and see my children right
[18:00] here
[18:01] and things like that that puts a burden
[18:02] but that burden goes higher
[18:04] for even the ones that are already in
[18:05] here is that we can't stay
[18:08] this is not just the hour that we stay
[18:11] just as believers
[18:12] right we got to go on to perfection
[18:16] what brother dale's been preaching on
[18:18] he's trying to get us in a mindset that
[18:20] no we're never going to be perfect
[18:22] richard marlow's always going to have
[18:24] gray hair
[18:25] told the change i told you i'll get you
[18:27] back until the change
[18:31] i'm not looking for his hair to change
[18:33] back you understand what i'm telling you
[18:34] i'm not looking for
[18:35] i'm not looking for us to go backwards
[18:39] we need to go forward in god you know
[18:41] what it starts with
[18:42] marriage life family life
[18:46] right down where we live and i've asked
[18:48] brother down he's given us grace to
[18:50] that i can take a few sundays and maybe
[18:52] um
[18:53] get on a series about family matters so
[18:56] you can read up if you want to on what
[18:58] the bible says about it and then we're
[18:59] going to read what the prophet says
[19:00] about it and then
[19:01] you know i've become uh jen and i mad 32
[19:04] years and
[19:05] coming up and we are grandparents and
[19:08] we're parents so
[19:10] maybe i've come to the place now where i
[19:12] can speak on it a little bit because you
[19:13] know what if you're not a grandfather
[19:14] you can't speak on that
[19:16] right if you're not a husband you can't
[19:17] speak on you know your wives
[19:19] i mean you know being married if you
[19:21] don't have a wife
[19:22] and it's just not
[19:25] you know it's maturity has come we've
[19:28] come to a place we all should be mature
[19:29] glory we all should be mature even in
[19:31] the gospel but we should be matured our
[19:33] homes first
[19:34] toward our family and then let's move
[19:37] that into the spiritual aspect
[19:39] just like what we're going to talk about
[19:40] today we're going to talk about love
[19:42] all right if we're in first corinthians
[19:43] 13 all right remember to next sunday
[19:45] i'll be at brother dutch scots
[19:47] he's inviting me to come preach for him
[19:48] so we're going to be there for the
[19:49] weekend next sunday so please
[19:51] keep us in your prayers brother um
[19:54] bob black's going to be doing the sun
[19:55] school class and he did a wonderful job
[19:57] this morning i mean a wonderful day
[19:59] he did really good and then remember
[20:01] that the dave ramsey preview
[20:02] is going to be february the 23rd that
[20:04] we're going to be teaching at the uh
[20:06] keller williams and and we've had a lot
[20:09] of people that have said they were going
[20:10] to come and we thank you for that
[20:12] so first corinthians 13 verse 1 let's
[20:14] say a prayer before we
[20:15] get started heavenly father
[20:19] we come today lord is it's just human
[20:22] vessel but father you have given us
[20:23] eternal life that's the baptism of the
[20:26] holy spirit that lord it
[20:28] it starts a fire in our soul and lord it
[20:30] works its way out and we should be able
[20:32] to show that lord
[20:34] and you sent your word lord down to us
[20:36] and give us the word and inside that
[20:38] word we need to glean out the things
[20:39] that you have for us for our day
[20:42] and our time lord and our season we've
[20:44] come lord where this is not a day to
[20:46] where luther's message or wesley's
[20:48] message or even pentecostal's message
[20:50] will help us it will give us a
[20:52] foundation but lord you sent us a
[20:54] prophet in the end time
[20:56] you sent us a man to lead as an example
[20:59] lord as close to the lord jesus as it
[21:01] could be lord for us to be able to
[21:03] to walk in what he said and father you
[21:06] sent
[21:07] your own son jesus christ yourself in
[21:10] human flesh lord the very epitome of
[21:12] love
[21:13] to come down here lord and to not just
[21:16] look over us lord but to be in us and
[21:18] let it be you working your way through
[21:21] us
[21:21] and today we pray lord that you would
[21:23] just be with us as we speak your word
[21:25] father
[21:26] not be a bystander but an active
[21:28] participant lord give us the eyes out of
[21:30] the holy spirit let our ears be open
[21:32] let us all be attentive to listen to you
[21:34] father what you have to say for us in
[21:36] this time
[21:37] bless us lord be with the ones that are
[21:38] sick the one names that we call this
[21:40] morning that are not among us
[21:42] for the how certain ones we ask you just
[21:44] bless them lord
[21:45] raise them up for your honor and glory
[21:46] lord because you get all the praise for
[21:48] it
[21:49] father thank you for keeping us all safe
[21:50] and bringing us here lord
[21:52] just be with us father as this week
[21:53] starts and sunday lord
[21:55] it's resurrection lord may we have a
[21:57] resurrection of you in our life
[21:59] and may it lord be not something that
[22:01] goes away lord but it'll be getting
[22:02] greater and greater as they go gone
[22:05] give us grace lord bless us keep us we
[22:07] praise your great name the name of the
[22:09] lord jesus christ
[22:10] amen first corinthians 13 verse one
[22:14] i think they have it up here i told them
[22:16] they're gonna they're gonna work again
[22:17] today
[22:18] those are some good guys back there in
[22:20] the back
[22:21] they said they were all gonna come up
[22:23] here and sing and i said who's gonna run
[22:25] the thing back there tonight it runs
[22:26] itself i said then who why do we need
[22:27] y'all
[22:31] that's not true we do need them though i
[22:34] speak with a tongue of many names i want
[22:36] you to fool it now this is paul
[22:38] a man with the holy ghost amen all right
[22:41] this is paul
[22:42] though i speak with the tongues of men
[22:44] and angels and have not charity i am
[22:46] become as a sounding brass
[22:48] or a tinkling symbol and though i have
[22:51] the gift of prophecy
[22:52] and to understand all mysteries that
[22:54] says all mysteries right
[22:56] and all knowledge and though i have all
[22:59] faith
[22:59] so that i could remove mountains now how
[23:02] many of us have done that
[23:05] and have not charity i am nothing
[23:08] and don't i bestow all my goods to feed
[23:10] the poor and though i give my body to be
[23:12] burned and have not charity it profiteth
[23:14] me
[23:15] nothing charity suffereth long and it's
[23:19] kind
[23:19] charity envy if not charity vaulteth not
[23:23] itself
[23:24] is not puffed up right does not behave
[23:27] itself
[23:27] unseemly seeketh not her own
[23:31] is not easily provoked thinketh no evil
[23:34] amen rejoiceth not in iniquity but
[23:37] rejoices in the truth
[23:39] beareth all things believeth all things
[23:42] hope is all things endureth all things
[23:45] right
[23:46] this charity is pretty tough isn't it
[23:47] amen look at first corinthians
[23:50] 13 8 13 8 seem familiar near
[23:54] yeah hebrews 13 8
[23:57] revelations 13 8 the names written in
[24:00] the book of life before the foundation
[24:01] the world hebrews 13 8 jesus christ same
[24:03] yesterday and ever now listen this first
[24:04] corinthians 13
[24:05] 8 charity never faileth
[24:09] but whether there be prophecies they'll
[24:11] fail
[24:12] whether there be tongues they shall
[24:14] cease
[24:15] whether there'll be knowledge it shall
[24:17] banish away
[24:18] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[24:20] part but when that which is perfect has
[24:22] come
[24:23] then that which is in part shall be done
[24:25] away when i was a child i spake of the
[24:27] child
[24:28] i understood as a child i thought as a
[24:30] child but when i became a man
[24:32] let me put it in my words we ought to
[24:34] quit acting like children
[24:36] when we become a man i put away childish
[24:38] things for now
[24:40] we see through a glass darkly right but
[24:43] then
[24:43] face to face now i know in part but then
[24:46] shall i know even as also i am known
[24:49] and now abideth faith hope
[24:52] charity these three but the greatest of
[24:55] these
[24:57] is charity amen he be seated
[25:02] the greatest of all that dissertation by
[25:06] paul
[25:07] he covered everything amen
[25:11] and he said the greatest there is is
[25:13] charity
[25:14] which is love unfained love
[25:19] and we'll get into something here in
[25:20] just a minute because
[25:24] it's hot up here because
[25:28] love is something that has been so
[25:31] misunderstood
[25:32] right you say oh i love this and i love
[25:35] that you know i love the deer hunt
[25:38] really that word love is so deluded
[25:42] until that's really not the love that we
[25:43] should be talking about
[25:45] all right you know you i like to go do
[25:48] those things but the love of god
[25:50] is the very you can't even really
[25:54] describe it brother brown when he went
[25:55] across
[25:56] the curtain of time what did he say this
[25:58] was perfect love
[25:59] right he said you can't even describe it
[26:02] he said the sisters would hug you and
[26:04] and and the brothers would hug you and
[26:07] and said it was just so much
[26:08] more than than you can ever imagine
[26:10] glory even paul when he went to the
[26:12] third heaven he the things that he
[26:14] couldn't even say why
[26:15] because we as human beings and that's
[26:17] what we're going to talk about today
[26:19] we as human beings do not live in the
[26:22] love or the charity that paul's talking
[26:24] about which is agape love
[26:26] right now you can say agape whatever
[26:29] we're going to worry about just a few
[26:31] things today
[26:32] and we're going to see how that brother
[26:35] branham which is
[26:37] brother branham brought us the absolute
[26:40] he was not the absolute but he brought
[26:42] us the amsterdam all right
[26:44] the absolute was jesus christ and we
[26:46] know that for for certainty but we'll
[26:47] get into that in just a second
[26:50] but now let's look
[26:53] at the first quote guys let's go ahead
[26:54] and pull them up brothers
[26:56] in bangerman brother brown preaching on
[26:59] life
[27:00] now there's life there's one kind of
[27:02] eternal life and that's god's life
[27:04] and when you receive that you have
[27:06] eternal life
[27:07] but life has many interpretations as it
[27:09] comes down
[27:11] there's love agape love filial love
[27:14] well there's love agape love that's
[27:16] number that's the top
[27:17] right love filio love
[27:20] lust see you just keep dropping down
[27:23] dropping down into the lowest of lows
[27:25] but all of that had a beginning so it'll
[27:27] have an end
[27:28] but those things which have no beginning
[27:30] will have no end
[27:32] so god had no beginning and his life had
[27:34] no beginning and it'll have no end
[27:36] and if you've got eternal life then you
[27:38] have no then then you have no end to
[27:40] eternal life it's forever and your
[27:42] character
[27:44] your character right it's proven
[27:48] by the life that's in you
[27:52] all right you say all my characters pre
[27:53] i proved my character by my
[27:55] my lineage and my uh that's what brother
[27:58] bob just really threw my soul this
[27:59] morning
[28:01] talking about lineages and he was
[28:03] talking about how you know you bring
[28:04] rehab in and you bring this one in and
[28:06] you bring
[28:07] folks ruth was a mobile right the out
[28:11] scour of the earth
[28:13] she was lower than a prostitute they
[28:15] would allow prostitutes into that city
[28:17] because they were prostitutes there
[28:18] but they would not allow morbidities to
[28:20] come into the comments of the temple and
[28:22] here she comes in
[28:24] and marries boaz
[28:27] but that's not the strange part
[28:30] who is boaz father yeah
[28:34] obed all right whose son was that
[28:38] rahab the harlot right so let's just
[28:42] forget all these lineages how we have
[28:44] this great lineage come down from adam
[28:46] and this great lineage from this one and
[28:48] greg
[28:48] forget all that because it's just you
[28:51] and i
[28:52] we were lost we come under a
[28:56] a a covenant that started with it if you
[28:59] do this
[29:00] don't do this god had to make an
[29:02] unconditional covenant
[29:04] that way we're all covered
[29:07] everybody's covered we're all covered
[29:10] let's read let's do number two here
[29:13] before we keep going on here you have
[29:14] south bend in indiana 1958.
[29:18] brother sister no poet they went insane
[29:20] trying to find the word to express the
[29:22] love of god
[29:23] there's never been a poet one of them
[29:25] said if all the ocean was ink and it
[29:27] would stalk on earth to quilt
[29:28] and all the skies the parchment made to
[29:30] write the love of god above would drain
[29:32] the ocean dry
[29:33] or could the scroll contain a hole those
[29:35] stretched from sky to sky
[29:37] love not love for one another not love
[29:40] for the world
[29:41] but the love of god amen the love of
[29:43] your wife is filial love
[29:45] the love for god is agape love million
[29:48] miles higher right every love not agape
[29:53] love see it says
[29:53] every love not a god we love it's
[29:55] perverted love
[29:56] which has an end right every love
[30:00] besides that love agape love has an end
[30:02] right because when we get over there
[30:04] there's not going to be
[30:06] a filial love it's all going to be agape
[30:09] all right that's why the sisters can hug
[30:11] the brothers over there because there's
[30:12] no jealousy there's no
[30:14] it doesn't see from from from god giving
[30:17] us the god beloved even in the holy
[30:18] ghost
[30:18] we still live and feel your love right
[30:21] we still live in eros or or love hate
[30:23] you say well that's
[30:24] bad this church would be empty without
[30:28] it
[30:28] that's right so i mean we just got
[30:32] but what matt what what satan done he
[30:34] just took the perfect
[30:35] and perverted it right right he took
[30:38] agape love
[30:39] and he said hey i can dilute that a
[30:41] little bit
[30:43] and get eve to love the beast
[30:46] as a relation and ain't going down to
[30:49] the lust part
[30:50] he just kept going further and you know
[30:52] what eve just kept going with him
[30:55] if she would have stayed behind the veil
[30:57] of her
[30:58] husband adam that wouldn't happen
[31:02] all right we're gonna when we get into
[31:04] this family thing
[31:06] we're gonna get into some real real
[31:09] teaching that i think we've kind of lost
[31:12] through the years
[31:14] and time everything had a beginning has
[31:16] an end and human love had a beginning
[31:18] and it has an end all the blessed
[31:20] eternal god love of god had no beginning
[31:22] and it will never have an end when the
[31:25] oceans have whipped himself into the
[31:26] deserts and the world has got so full of
[31:28] sin till the heavens has turned its back
[31:30] on it
[31:31] and it staggers out through space like a
[31:32] drunk man coming home
[31:34] the love of god shall still endure
[31:36] saints and angel song
[31:38] glory hey man if you'll pull up that now
[31:40] we'll i want you to look at that just
[31:41] look at these
[31:42] different forms i got this out of
[31:44] wikipedia
[31:46] and it's pretty neat but see where it
[31:48] says agape love is charitable
[31:51] selfless whatever that word is and
[31:54] unconditional
[31:56] in the parable i've seen as creating
[31:57] goodness in the world
[31:59] it is the way god is seen to love
[32:01] humanity
[32:02] and it's a scene the kind of love that
[32:03] christians aspire to have for each other
[32:07] right see that's why we don't hug
[32:09] sisters in
[32:10] this realm body right
[32:14] because of all these other ones coming
[32:16] on down further yeah right
[32:18] feel your love also used in the new
[32:19] testament you know in the old testament
[32:21] agape love is not
[32:22] converted in the old testament it's
[32:24] another word and we'll get to that in a
[32:26] second
[32:26] only when you pick up matthew 5 where
[32:28] dad's been preaching 5 43
[32:30] when it says love your neighbor that
[32:33] don't mean you go up and say hey buddy i
[32:34] love you
[32:35] that's agape love right right brother
[32:38] brother nick studied this he knows that
[32:40] he's when he got me kind of thinking on
[32:41] those
[32:42] on these four things of love and then
[32:44] then talking about with uh
[32:46] with valentine's day coming up also
[32:48] using the new testament philia is human
[32:50] response to something that is found to
[32:52] be delightful
[32:54] also known as brotherly love which we
[32:56] feel you'll love you say well that's the
[32:57] love for your wife
[32:58] but also like i said it's a love for
[33:00] hunting it's a love for doing this
[33:01] that's a love for that
[33:02] it's just kind of and then watch how
[33:04] satan he brings that down to sexual love
[33:06] which is eros
[33:08] is never used in the new testament but
[33:10] it's more prominent in the old testament
[33:12] why
[33:13] because jesus brought agape love with
[33:17] him on the earth on
[33:18] in the new testament because agape love
[33:20] is what am
[33:21] what adam had right
[33:25] adam was christ he had if he had not had
[33:29] agape love
[33:32] how many of you let me just ask this
[33:34] question
[33:35] how many of you would take your wife
[33:37] back if you found out that she hadn't
[33:38] had a relationship
[33:40] with an animal right right with an
[33:43] animal
[33:46] that had to be agape love because that
[33:48] was unconditional
[33:50] you see we're going to get into some
[33:51] things here i'm sorry we have to say
[33:53] some of these words but
[33:54] we're we're living in human we still got
[33:56] this thing to worry about
[33:58] all right now number four is storage
[34:00] which is the neediest child
[34:01] parent because see and you look it's
[34:03] been perverted in our day all these
[34:05] others have been perverted
[34:07] but this is my kids can't love me
[34:11] with feel your love as that says
[34:14] as a husband and wife or that
[34:16] relationship but i love my children
[34:18] in a storage or needy children to child
[34:21] to parent love only appears in the
[34:23] compound word
[34:24] which is there in romans 12. so there's
[34:26] your four different kinds of love
[34:28] agape love failure love that's why you
[34:30] have the philadelphian age
[34:33] was the age of what they brotherly loved
[34:36] all right
[34:37] brother brown told us that and then eros
[34:39] is the is the sensual or sexual lust
[34:41] that we have
[34:42] for our supposed to be for our spouse
[34:46] only but what did satan do he perverted
[34:49] all that
[34:49] but what satan did he pulled that agape
[34:52] love and he started putting so much
[34:53] water to it till he diluted it down
[34:56] and now everybody in the earth thinks
[34:58] all those four are one
[34:59] oh yeah and it's the third one yeah
[35:03] because look at this age right and i got
[35:05] a quote which i don't have guys you
[35:06] don't just leave that up there for a
[35:08] second
[35:08] i pulled this one up because brother
[35:10] claw and i were talking about this the
[35:11] other day
[35:12] and i had not heard brother brown say
[35:13] this but in god's power to transform
[35:15] 1965
[35:17] and now in the last church age we find
[35:19] here that they're naked again and don't
[35:20] know it
[35:21] but it's not the holy spirit veil it's
[35:24] the veil that satan slipped over eve
[35:26] back there a veil of lust the less veil
[35:30] and they're so filthy until they don't
[35:31] know it and that's what happened
[35:34] adam remember now let's
[35:37] start looking at family because adam
[35:40] was eve's protection
[35:43] right adam was he's protection
[35:47] fathers until your daughters or sons get
[35:49] out
[35:50] on their own and do their own thing and
[35:52] have their you know have their
[35:54] family you're their holy ghost
[35:58] brother mark you're mars holy ghost
[36:00] until he gets the holy ghost
[36:04] exactly adam adam and eve
[36:09] were a little different situation than
[36:11] us they came from the same exactly the
[36:13] same body
[36:14] yeah june and i didn't come from the
[36:15] same body physically but adam and eve
[36:17] did come physically from the same body
[36:19] but you got to remember it wasn't adam
[36:20] and eve to begin with
[36:22] right it was adam and woman yeah
[36:25] it actually was just adam right when god
[36:28] looked at adam and eve he didn't see two
[36:30] people
[36:30] right he saw one person right
[36:34] and to keep that holy ghost veil if she
[36:38] would have stayed with her help
[36:40] me right right
[36:43] she wouldn't have got away from that and
[36:46] got over the
[36:46] into the lush valley right but now that
[36:48] we're under the lust well what's
[36:50] happened
[36:50] we're under the lust veil which jesus
[36:53] christ had to come to get us back to the
[36:54] holy ghost baby
[36:55] right because that's where in that that
[36:58] if people don't understand the old
[37:00] testament couldn't have had the baptism
[37:02] of the holy ghost right
[37:03] like the believers do in the new
[37:05] testament
[37:06] they couldn't have the soul of god in
[37:09] their soul
[37:10] or they wouldn't do some of the things
[37:11] you look in the old testament it's kind
[37:13] of hard to believe some of the things
[37:14] that they did
[37:16] that were supposedly that god ordained
[37:20] god told the prophet one time to go
[37:21] marry a prostitute
[37:23] right jacob did what he did all these
[37:26] other people did what they did look what
[37:28] lot did with his daughters
[37:29] that was why that was satan perverting
[37:32] the true love that came from the garden
[37:34] right
[37:35] and then man has been trying to get back
[37:37] to that true love in the garden
[37:39] you and i we shouldn't throw away the
[37:42] the love that we have for our wife
[37:43] god forbid but we should be looking that
[37:47] if brother brown said our love for god
[37:49] is
[37:49] millions times higher now everybody in
[37:52] this room knows i love my wife
[37:55] but can you take that times millions
[37:57] right million
[37:58] times higher and that's the love that
[38:00] we're supposed to have for god
[38:02] exactly but it's not a sloppy love it's
[38:04] not some love that
[38:06] that we take for granted no it's a love
[38:08] that he had to only bring himself
[38:12] there's no other human could bring that
[38:14] love because we fell
[38:16] right we fell from this all the way down
[38:20] and there's no way we can get back to
[38:21] that agape look that way
[38:23] all right
[38:26] so now
[38:30] i thought we wouldn't be very long but
[38:33] look
[38:34] under the holy oats veil we were
[38:37] supposed to multiply and replenish the
[38:38] earth
[38:38] you're right right genesis 1 26 and 27
[38:42] had nothing that was the love of god
[38:44] that was agape love that's
[38:46] what jesus brought with him when he came
[38:49] to this earth glory
[38:50] he brought that agape love right he
[38:53] brought the love of almighty god he
[38:55] didn't bring it he was it
[38:57] all right he was the love of almighty
[39:01] almighty god so we're supposed to
[39:03] multiply and replenish the earth we're
[39:05] supposed to love our brother
[39:07] we're supposed to love our
[39:11] wife as christ loves us
[39:14] amen that's where we're going to empty
[39:16] the church on
[39:18] but in matthew 5 43 you see all these
[39:22] all these things that happened in the in
[39:24] the new testament i mean the old
[39:25] testament go and pull up quote number
[39:26] three
[39:28] brother joseph can or brother richard
[39:30] whoever back there
[39:32] but in the old testament they had
[39:36] they lived under the lust bale because
[39:38] there was no holy ghost fell there
[39:41] they procreated as man should should not
[39:44] have but they procreated
[39:46] by this lust battle but to get us back
[39:50] to the holy ghost veil
[39:53] god had to come himself
[39:57] jesus christ because in the new
[39:59] testament the first thing he comes up
[40:02] and
[40:02] in the old testament if you'll look up
[40:04] the old testament the word love
[40:06] is used about 125 times and it's ahaba
[40:11] there's a word for it and it's human
[40:12] love or sexual love
[40:14] but in the new testament from the new
[40:16] testament
[40:17] anything that talks about love the first
[40:19] time it's used in matthew 5 43
[40:21] for brother dale's been preaching on it
[40:23] means that strong's number 25 which is
[40:25] the gospel
[40:26] agape love so jesus had when he started
[40:29] preaching the kingdom
[40:30] that was the agape love coming back to
[40:33] the might to man
[40:34] right he was bringing it back to you and
[40:37] i
[40:38] it was not something that that we didn't
[40:40] forget how to love our wives we're not
[40:42] supposed to forget how we left how to
[40:43] love our wives we're not supposed to
[40:45] forget how we love our children
[40:47] right because we still live in this yeah
[40:50] but that agape love is supposed to
[40:52] somewhere take over in here
[40:54] all right folks let me tell you
[40:55] something let me say that one more time
[40:56] that holy ghost that
[40:58] that that holy ghost veil is in there
[41:02] but it's covered by this lush veil that
[41:03] we have right right
[41:05] there's nothing wrong with having love
[41:06] for your family there's nothing wrong
[41:07] with having love for your wife
[41:09] or one another but god didn't say in
[41:11] matthew 5 43
[41:13] he told you to love your neighbor
[41:18] love your brother that's not filial
[41:20] though
[41:21] look up that strong's 25 that's agape
[41:24] love
[41:24] amen so he's not telling you to love
[41:26] your brother
[41:27] just say well you know your neighbor
[41:30] just
[41:30] saying well i love this guy because he's
[41:32] really nice
[41:34] that's not a goth to love right you're
[41:37] supposed to love him with unconditional
[41:39] love
[41:39] look right here
[41:42] now there's only one thing the church
[41:44] has to do if you want somebody to come
[41:45] to christ you'll be salty
[41:47] salt makes a thirst you be salty and the
[41:49] world will get thirsty
[41:51] for in a man he is in one sense a
[41:52] miniature creator if he's a child of god
[41:55] because the spirit of god is in him who
[41:56] controls him who operates him
[41:58] and i'd like to let you in just a few
[42:00] minutes that i know to be the truth
[42:03] if i had just a little more voice i'd
[42:04] like to preach on that tonight but i'd
[42:06] like to let you in on some things as
[42:07] this what divine
[42:08] what divine love now listen paul said
[42:10] where there's tones they shall cease
[42:12] prophecies they shall fail
[42:14] where there's all these signs the
[42:15] antichrist can produce any sign that's
[42:17] in the bible
[42:18] but he cannot love
[42:22] he could not love eve
[42:26] like adam loved beef
[42:30] so but eve leaning toward him because of
[42:33] the
[42:34] lust desire
[42:37] the antichrist proved that he couldn't
[42:39] love
[42:40] he perverts love there's nothing about
[42:43] him
[42:44] to love oh you can have some kind of a
[42:46] false love
[42:47] there's two kinds of love there's a love
[42:49] which is called human love or in the
[42:51] greek word it's called filial
[42:53] and the divine love which is the gospel
[42:55] of god for love is divine love
[42:57] when divine love is in your heart
[42:59] there's a difference in your life
[43:01] and everybody knows it
[43:08] how many people know that their neighbor
[43:09] knows they're christian yeah
[43:13] that's right you live like a christian
[43:14] act like a christian walk like a
[43:16] christian and your whole system
[43:18] your whole system is timed to god's
[43:23] bible how many of us can say amen to
[43:26] that amen
[43:27] but now listen john 3 16 for god so
[43:32] loved the world that he gave his only
[43:35] begotten son
[43:36] that who should ever believe in him
[43:38] whosoever believed in him should
[43:39] what not perish but have everlasting
[43:42] life
[43:44] that's unconditional covenant you said
[43:46] oh no he come to get his own
[43:49] he loved the whole world remember
[43:51] there's no sinners are saying so he
[43:53] loves the world unconditionally
[43:55] but we've got to accept that love to get
[43:58] back into this holy ghost veil
[44:01] and that's what it is folks that brother
[44:03] brother dale's going to
[44:04] tell you how to get there but it's the
[44:08] love of god that you don't have when
[44:10] you're born
[44:11] it's a love of god you don't have that
[44:13] you maybe think you have
[44:15] because if you really got it there's
[44:17] certain things you wouldn't do
[44:18] right exactly there's certain things we
[44:20] wouldn't
[44:21] we wouldn't be even contemplating doing
[44:25] if we had that holy ghost veil again
[44:28] which is the new birth
[44:29] amen and who come to bring it jesus
[44:32] which was
[44:36] what a paradox here stands the very love
[44:39] of god
[44:40] on the earth and he's having to deal
[44:44] with filial love
[44:46] he ross and stores he's having to deal
[44:49] with
[44:50] all of them and he's walking through
[44:52] life
[44:53] so you and i walk through life the first
[44:54] part of our life and it wasn't the very
[44:56] first one we put up there i promise you
[44:58] that
[44:58] right we really didn't know much about
[45:01] filial love
[45:02] exactly right remember i've told you
[45:03] many times how we married we'll get into
[45:06] that
[45:07] you really don't know your partner you
[45:09] learn to love them
[45:11] the first one is number three
[45:14] a little bit of e-roll a little bit of a
[45:17] little bit of uh
[45:18] human lust sorry that's plain but
[45:23] that's the way it is because you do not
[45:25] you cannot humanly love something that
[45:27] you don't know anything about
[45:30] humanly you can't do it right even with
[45:33] agape love
[45:34] why do you think god had this all wrote
[45:36] down in a book for us
[45:38] oh yeah because we couldn't understand
[45:41] it without somebody teaching it to us
[45:43] paul would not could not teach it he
[45:45] could not give that whole dissertation
[45:47] in corinthians about charity
[45:48] if he didn't have it exactly paul
[45:54] peter peter could not have told us about
[45:56] these virtues
[45:57] how in the world could he had told us
[45:59] how to get these things
[46:01] if you didn't have them exactly right
[46:03] i've never been to new york city
[46:05] how can i tell you how to get there
[46:08] oh i can show you the internet pictures
[46:10] and i show you this and show you that
[46:14] but i've never been there but if i've
[46:16] been there
[46:18] i can tell you all about it same way
[46:20] with jesus jesus had to come
[46:22] to live among us live in that love not
[46:26] partake of it
[46:27] right but he was absolutely affected by
[46:31] it
[46:31] amen
[46:35] he was affected by it he was tempted by
[46:38] women
[46:40] right here's a good one pull up number
[46:44] pull up number four i think he's number
[46:46] four
[46:48] yeah number four everybody thinks
[46:52] and some of you in here are more
[46:53] compassionate than i am
[46:55] and that's okay but let me show you
[46:58] about this
[47:00] like i was preaching the other night on
[47:01] love there's two different kinds of love
[47:02] agape and feeling them
[47:03] and got beloved is above the levels of
[47:06] the earth and they're contrary
[47:07] one to the other so is compassion
[47:12] remember i told you one time
[47:15] if you ever ask god for anything and he
[47:17] says no
[47:18] that's the best yes you'll ever get in
[47:20] your life amen
[47:22] that'll make the eyes cross but remember
[47:26] he knows if he tells you yes what you'll
[47:28] do
[47:29] so if he tells you no then you know one
[47:31] thing's for sure he knows you're going
[47:32] to mess up if he says yes
[47:34] so if he says no you say thank god i
[47:36] would have done something wrong with
[47:38] that
[47:38] so it's compassion we'll take it up a
[47:40] little later in the week these things
[47:41] what it is but
[47:42] human compassion and compassion of god
[47:45] is so
[47:46] contrary we feel we feel so horribly bad
[47:49] for different people who are afflicted
[47:51] who are sick
[47:52] who are having trouble and sometimes we
[47:53] don't understand what they're feeling
[47:54] bad about
[47:55] notice him coming by this pool could you
[47:58] imagine your savior walking by this pool
[48:02] but there's got to be an answer right
[48:04] the answer for it was
[48:06] he did only what the father showed me to
[48:08] do
[48:10] hundreds of people hundreds of people
[48:13] that were sick and afflicted
[48:15] god told him to go to one man and heal
[48:17] that man you think oh
[48:18] the love of god would have just healed
[48:20] them all
[48:22] god's nose remember are the best yeses
[48:24] you ever get
[48:26] god telling those people no it was the
[48:28] best yes they ever got
[48:31] but human compassion sometimes we mix
[48:33] human compassion and god's compassion
[48:35] and
[48:36] and right here brother brown tells us
[48:37] they're contrary
[48:39] contrary one to the other just like when
[48:42] we get into the uh
[48:43] get into the study about harmony at home
[48:47] everything has to have a principle but
[48:50] it all must start with the biblical
[48:52] principle
[48:54] right biblical principles first not what
[48:57] your mama taught you not what your daddy
[48:58] taught you
[48:59] and even brother branham you know he
[49:00] told that sister he said now you do
[49:02] everything your husband tells you to do
[49:04] but if he ever does any tells you to do
[49:06] something contrary to the word of god
[49:09] he said you don't have to do that
[49:10] exactly all right
[49:12] then christ just takes over as your head
[49:15] but see if you're that's why it says
[49:16] don't let
[49:17] believers and unbelievers marry this all
[49:19] ties back together to people
[49:22] you want to make your life better live
[49:25] by the bible
[49:27] you want to make your life easier live
[49:28] by the scripture
[49:30] that will make your life so much yeah
[49:33] better but look you leave and look and
[49:37] you see how jesus walked through life
[49:40] that's why he couldn't call his
[49:44] uh couldn't call mary his mother because
[49:46] there was no love between
[49:48] the the mother and child relationship
[49:51] because he was agape love
[49:53] he wasn't lesser form of love he
[49:54] couldn't be because he has to be the
[49:56] example for us to get back
[49:58] to you see what i'm saying same way with
[50:01] the compassion
[50:02] the pastor may do some things and you
[50:04] think my heavens
[50:05] why did he do that well you know what
[50:08] there's a lot of other things involved
[50:11] with that that he's had to go through
[50:16] that we must understand that the
[50:18] compassion is the godly compassion
[50:20] because with human compassion we're all
[50:22] a bunch of dodeo granddaddies
[50:24] is that right isn't that right baby
[50:29] isn't that right i love you
[50:33] she can't do anything wrong
[50:37] see you there
[50:43] see that's why dog's not a granddaddy
[50:45] though right
[50:48] that's not you can't get agape love and
[50:50] a grandpa together
[50:52] you just think there's no work you know
[50:54] you just it's just too much
[50:56] we have too much human compassion but
[50:59] remember
[51:00] the compassion that god has for us is
[51:02] that as they all would be saved
[51:05] the compassion that god has was i'm
[51:08] going to come down and die for you
[51:10] so that you all can be safe everybody
[51:13] right
[51:13] all right but he knew only a certain
[51:17] people would
[51:19] and he knew that he had to get us back
[51:22] under that holy ghost bale
[51:23] to even be able to communicate with him
[51:26] to even be able to
[51:27] understand this all these emotions and
[51:30] all this
[51:31] seemingly love that we have for our
[51:33] brothers and love because
[51:34] look you take that and and many times
[51:38] we see that brother brown says money
[51:40] women in popularity
[51:42] are the three things that are downfall
[51:44] of a preacher money women in popularity
[51:46] why because it lets you get into all
[51:48] these different emotions
[51:50] and as a preacher aaron knows it and
[51:53] daddy knows it and anybody that's even
[51:55] ever ministered knows
[51:57] that we can get in the channel and get
[52:00] you to do anything
[52:01] yeah anything yeah
[52:05] that's why you have to be careful with
[52:06] money women
[52:08] in popularity you see too many people
[52:10] start leaning over to this one side and
[52:12] the popularity side
[52:14] i got some quotes on that but we're not
[52:15] going to talk about that today and then
[52:17] on the woman's side
[52:18] the women's side because women are
[52:21] compassionate
[52:23] and and that compassionate spirit comes
[52:25] out
[52:26] and then it draws two together and then
[52:28] you see all this mix-up like we've had
[52:30] even in the message of the hour
[52:31] much less all that other junk that goes
[52:33] on out in the world
[52:35] with all these preachers living with
[52:37] kids and all that junk like that
[52:39] well see what does that do that bro it's
[52:41] brought under
[52:42] satan said hey i'm gonna take the
[52:45] greatest love
[52:46] that ever was and i'm going to pervert
[52:49] it
[52:51] i'm going to make them think that they
[52:53] just love each other
[52:55] oh yeah but i'm going to put them in the
[52:57] biggest trap
[52:58] of their entire life because i'm going
[53:01] to make them think that this love
[53:03] is this life that's why brother brown
[53:05] had to come and he had to tell us that
[53:07] hey
[53:08] basically when you do come down to it
[53:10] there's only two
[53:11] brother that really there's only two and
[53:13] that's agape loving
[53:15] human and filial love now you mix those
[53:17] others in there with it
[53:18] but it's the love of god and it's a love
[53:20] we have for everything else right
[53:22] whether it be what brother brown said
[53:23] love of god love of man
[53:25] lust you go you keep going down further
[53:28] and further
[53:28] all right but god did give us a longing
[53:34] to get back to him not of all these
[53:37] other loves
[53:38] glory not of lust not of not of the just
[53:42] the failure love no he wants us back to
[53:44] the agape love
[53:45] glory because that's the only way you
[53:46] can communicate with god
[53:48] listen i'm going to tell you something
[53:49] that's the only way you can really
[53:51] communicate with your husband and wife
[53:54] that's right brother brown's brother
[53:58] brown said this
[53:59] three you always say three is a crowd
[54:02] well then this three is not a crowd it's
[54:04] you your spouse
[54:06] and god he said when you're missing one
[54:09] he said you can't get these two together
[54:11] i'll bring all those quotes i got them
[54:13] coming up
[54:14] in the in the little part that we're
[54:15] going to do that's why we should not
[54:18] we should not marry unbelievers but i
[54:19] know you know
[54:21] it happens sometimes it happens for a
[54:24] purpose
[54:25] yeah a lot of you uh i married an
[54:28] unbeliever but you know what i wasn't a
[54:29] believer either
[54:30] so it was just two unbelievers man on
[54:32] each other
[54:34] so but i knew right from right well now
[54:36] wait a minute i didn't know right from
[54:38] wrong i thought i knew right from wrong
[54:39] and i had been taught right
[54:41] but i took the wrong yeah legal yes yes
[54:45] legally i knew what was going on
[54:46] right i could tell you about serpent
[54:48] seed come on i see all you people that
[54:50] kind of grew up robbie shake your head
[54:51] we all did the same thing
[54:53] we thought we were okay and then
[54:56] we got under them other veils
[55:00] but thank god he's brought us all back
[55:04] glory because that's the if you don't
[55:07] get anything else get this the epitome
[55:09] of love
[55:10] is what god has written in this bible
[55:12] for us glory there's no other love you
[55:14] can understand there's no other
[55:17] uh kids that are growing up some of you
[55:19] there are young kids that's not married
[55:20] that are growing up
[55:21] there's no greater love than you'd have
[55:23] for god now if you have
[55:25] love for god first all these other loves
[55:29] will come into being
[55:31] and they'll all mix really well together
[55:34] and you'll have a real good human life
[55:37] because you do have a human life
[55:40] right we're still human right i'm not
[55:43] gonna pick on you today
[55:44] we're all still human but we all still
[55:47] must get back under that holy ghost veil
[55:49] amen because once under that holy ghost
[55:52] spell then god can deal with us
[55:54] listen god can deal with us the way he
[55:56] dealt with adam amen
[55:58] right now he can deal with us just like
[56:02] and adam was the ruler of this earth
[56:05] there's no way we can rule and reign
[56:07] without this without this holy ghost
[56:09] veil
[56:10] without getting us back under the veil
[56:12] that god give us
[56:14] but we still have to live under this
[56:16] lush veil that he's given us because we
[56:17] have to procreate now this way
[56:20] so husband and wife must come together
[56:22] but see under
[56:23] the love that god has he's allowed
[56:28] he's a lot good again well he's back in
[56:30] the back pray for him he's having a
[56:32] tough time
[56:34] early gary acting pray for him he's
[56:37] having a tough time
[56:39] but you know the bible says the bed is
[56:42] undefiled
[56:44] so what goes on there is okay with god
[56:47] but that wasn't the way he wanted it to
[56:49] start with right but he allowed that to
[56:52] happen to get us here because once
[56:54] eve did what she did there was no way
[56:56] that she could get back under that veil
[56:58] exactly
[56:59] so in not getting her back under that
[57:01] veil
[57:02] he couldn't get you back right because
[57:05] she surely couldn't get you back under
[57:06] that mail
[57:07] that's why he said i'll put enmity
[57:09] between you in other words i'll come
[57:11] i'll come through the way that was that
[57:13] was
[57:14] wrong the way he didn't come wrong he
[57:17] come the way that was wrong
[57:19] all right through the wound all right to
[57:22] clean that
[57:23] part to show us that hey even though we
[57:26] do come understand we are
[57:28] born like brother bob and that really
[57:29] just blessed my heart because
[57:32] you know in the old testament if june
[57:35] and i had a child and
[57:37] and that child was illegitimate
[57:40] there was no way that god had on the
[57:43] earth
[57:44] listen to my words that god had on the
[57:45] earth to cleanse that
[57:48] sin sure he could cover it and not kill
[57:51] the person right
[57:52] but it took 400 years
[57:57] exactly if june and i had a child
[58:00] which would be josh and he was born a
[58:03] bastard child right
[58:04] or out of wedlock from josh to 400
[58:08] years could not come back into a church
[58:11] right
[58:14] pretty strong huh but brother brown
[58:17] doesn't stop there he goes on to say
[58:19] but under the blood of jesus
[58:22] christ it cleans you immediately
[58:26] and you're welcome in the church
[58:30] look how much stronger glory pull up
[58:34] number five
[58:35] well you know or which one of you
[58:37] whichever one of you back there
[58:40] door to the heart shout into tennessee
[58:41] how many really loves the lord just
[58:43] really love them
[58:44] i don't care what church that isn't that
[58:45] wonderful at least 95 maybe better 100
[58:48] i trust that we love him what is god god
[58:51] is love
[58:54] he that loveth is of god now that isn't
[58:57] what we call free love
[58:59] that's agape love right there's two
[59:02] different kinds of love one of them
[59:03] greek word
[59:04] one of them is the greek word filio
[59:07] filio means friendship the kind you have
[59:09] for your wife love that kind of love
[59:11] that kind of love is not a true love oh
[59:13] i know you little teenagers want to
[59:15] believe that but it's wrong
[59:17] that kind of love will make you jealous
[59:19] of your wife
[59:20] you'll take a pistol and blow a man's
[59:22] brains out because of her
[59:24] that ain't real love that's feel your
[59:26] love but agape love
[59:29] will make you get down and pray for that
[59:31] man's lost soul
[59:33] that's agape love that's the kind of
[59:35] love the church needs
[59:36] what we all need is that kind of love
[59:39] now let's read this let's finish god
[59:42] give me that love
[59:43] i'd rather have that experience of love
[59:47] than have all listen to this man he's a
[59:50] prophet
[59:51] he's lived in realms that we've never
[59:52] lived in spiritual realms that we've
[59:55] never lived in
[59:57] i'd rather have that experience of love
[59:59] then have all the gifts that god's got
[1:00:02] in his heaven for you can have every
[1:00:05] gift god's got and still
[1:00:07] be lost amen how many knows that that's
[1:00:10] exactly right it's love the love of god
[1:00:12] where there's tongues they shall cease
[1:00:14] whereas prophecy it is failed where
[1:00:16] there's knowledge it'll vanish but when
[1:00:17] that which is perfect shall come
[1:00:19] it endures forever love love one another
[1:00:24] that's a great saying amen amen i'm
[1:00:27] look i've got to have that experience
[1:00:30] than to have all of the gifts that god's
[1:00:33] got in heaven amen
[1:00:34] because if you got that love if you've
[1:00:37] got that love
[1:00:39] it brings all those other loves under
[1:00:42] subjection to that love
[1:00:44] all right the problem is is when we get
[1:00:47] when we're not born again see that takes
[1:00:49] away the first love agape love and then
[1:00:51] you live under all those other three
[1:00:53] yeah that's what the problem is but when
[1:00:55] you bring a godly love in
[1:00:57] and you put it in a home and you pray
[1:01:00] over your children
[1:01:02] there's no reason that god won't move
[1:01:06] except for the sin that you have yeah
[1:01:10] you know if you cut your hair we're
[1:01:12] going to get in all this
[1:01:14] you cut your hair sisters do you know
[1:01:16] god will not hear
[1:01:17] your prayer for nothing right nothing
[1:01:21] except your repentance then
[1:01:24] once you do that
[1:01:28] then you can pray for your family
[1:01:31] husbands same thing
[1:01:35] we'll get into all that
[1:01:39] but there was no true love on this earth
[1:01:42] until jesus came but really
[1:01:45] that's not the way he wanted it exactly
[1:01:48] right
[1:01:49] so that wasn't the true love he wanted
[1:01:52] he was the true love he wanted that love
[1:01:54] to be put into the people
[1:01:55] amen so on the day of pentecost that's
[1:01:58] when the agape love the love of god came
[1:02:00] into those people
[1:02:01] so much until they were so
[1:02:05] mad and so mean before like peter
[1:02:09] and all those it just changed their
[1:02:12] whole countenance they were just like
[1:02:13] drunk people they went out into the
[1:02:15] streets
[1:02:16] if anybody said something to them then
[1:02:18] so what
[1:02:20] big deal same way with you and i
[1:02:23] we get somebody thump us on the head or
[1:02:26] or bump us going down the hallway or
[1:02:28] or do something to us and boy the first
[1:02:30] thing we want to do is store our dupes
[1:02:31] up
[1:02:32] what's our problem we didn't let the
[1:02:36] love of god take over
[1:02:37] right right i mean if you physically
[1:02:40] want to hurt somebody
[1:02:42] where's the love of god in that i don't
[1:02:44] care who you are
[1:02:45] right amen what did he just say he said
[1:02:48] the love of god
[1:02:49] the one right here this one i'll take a
[1:02:51] pistol and blow a man's brains out is
[1:02:53] filial love that's the love you have for
[1:02:54] your wife
[1:02:55] well now what how many of us truly can
[1:02:57] say
[1:02:59] that if we saw somebody molesting our
[1:03:03] wife
[1:03:04] is the first thing we do is get down on
[1:03:05] our knees and pray for him
[1:03:10] after i shot him i'd probably pray
[1:03:14] just to be real honest with you but now
[1:03:17] look that don't mean that's just like
[1:03:18] brother dale said that don't mean
[1:03:20] the bible says turn the other cheek that
[1:03:22] doesn't mean the guy keeps hitting you
[1:03:23] in the cheek 14 or 15 times
[1:03:27] you get away from it right okay if he
[1:03:29] slaps you in the jaw turn it up don't
[1:03:31] just say hey here's another one go ahead
[1:03:33] have at it
[1:03:34] don't let's don't be stupid like paul
[1:03:37] said god forbid if you think that's what
[1:03:38] i'm talking about
[1:03:39] that i would stand to let my wife be
[1:03:41] molested in front of me and me not
[1:03:43] physically try to do something about it
[1:03:45] but i would not have malice in my heart
[1:03:47] toward that man when i got him away from
[1:03:49] her
[1:03:49] exactly how many of us can do that
[1:03:54] we still got we still got to deal with
[1:03:56] road
[1:03:57] let somebody's playing with their wife
[1:04:01] amen amen that's right praise the lord
[1:04:04] somebody
[1:04:05] somebody is honest i'm telling you folks
[1:04:10] i've told you this before when you look
[1:04:14] around
[1:04:15] go and pull up colossians when you look
[1:04:18] around the message of the hour
[1:04:20] i know we're all going to find faults
[1:04:22] we're all going to be sticky
[1:04:24] we're all going to be failures and the
[1:04:26] human things that we do
[1:04:29] but now like brother dale said the other
[1:04:30] day which i i love
[1:04:32] the way he put it but we should be
[1:04:35] moving so close to god
[1:04:37] that some of these little things should
[1:04:40] be just shedding off
[1:04:42] what did brother brown say when he saw
[1:04:43] that vision
[1:04:45] of the man pouring the water into this
[1:04:48] right remember that remember sister
[1:04:51] shepard's dream
[1:04:52] a man was pouring water in here and he
[1:04:54] said
[1:04:55] trash was coming out right trash can i
[1:04:58] say it one more time
[1:04:59] trash was coming out of a christian
[1:05:04] because that's supposed to be a
[1:05:05] christian right christian
[1:05:07] pouring it in trash was coming out so
[1:05:10] being born again
[1:05:13] by the incorruptible word of god that's
[1:05:15] the only way we can be
[1:05:18] truly a child of god is to first be born
[1:05:21] again
[1:05:22] then let his love take over
[1:05:26] how many of us honestly
[1:05:30] how many of us could open the door in
[1:05:32] our houses today
[1:05:33] and let jesus christ walk in and not be
[1:05:35] ashamed
[1:05:36] and not be trying to hide something or
[1:05:38] kick something under the
[1:05:40] hit something under the under the bed or
[1:05:46] you know what every time you walk
[1:05:48] through that door right he's walking
[1:05:50] through that door
[1:05:51] right you're not bringing him with you
[1:05:55] you're not waiting on him to show up
[1:05:57] when you show up he shows up
[1:05:59] right because i thought he's supposed to
[1:06:01] be with you even
[1:06:02] right thank you pull up the
[1:06:06] colossians let's just read a few
[1:06:10] scriptures here and then we'll quit i
[1:06:11] want i just kind of want to set a basis
[1:06:13] of what we're going to be doing
[1:06:14] we're going to be talking about love
[1:06:17] relationship
[1:06:18] marriage the love you have between
[1:06:21] husband and wife
[1:06:23] the love you should have for your fellow
[1:06:25] man the love you should have for your
[1:06:27] children
[1:06:28] the love you should have for your church
[1:06:31] members
[1:06:33] and this is what paul said look
[1:06:37] colossians 3 13 for
[1:06:40] forbearing one another and forgiving one
[1:06:44] another
[1:06:45] being a man have a quarrel against any
[1:06:47] even as
[1:06:48] christ forgave you so also do you
[1:06:52] and above all these things put on
[1:06:56] charity
[1:06:57] which is the bond
[1:07:00] of perfectness what brother dale been
[1:07:02] preaching though it's the bond that
[1:07:04] holds the perfectness together it's the
[1:07:05] glue
[1:07:06] all right it's the glue that holds all
[1:07:08] that together
[1:07:10] first timothy 1 verse 5. now the end of
[1:07:12] the commandment is charity out of a pure
[1:07:14] heart
[1:07:15] now look
[1:07:18] let's not change scripture but let's
[1:07:20] turn that thing let's read it backwards
[1:07:22] because what he's telling us now the end
[1:07:24] of the commandment is charity
[1:07:26] out of a pure heart now if you have
[1:07:28] faith unfaint
[1:07:30] if you have a good conscience and if you
[1:07:32] have a pure heart
[1:07:33] that's the end of charity that's where
[1:07:35] charity ends and you say end like no
[1:07:38] no it doesn't end like this in other
[1:07:39] words you've produced it right
[1:07:43] remember seven seals the end of all
[1:07:45] things brother dale's preachers many
[1:07:47] times the end is not
[1:07:48] the end like you're stepping off of a
[1:07:51] cliff
[1:07:52] it's not the end it means that it's been
[1:07:54] it's been fulfilled right
[1:07:56] right it's been fulfilled it's been done
[1:07:59] now the end of the commandment is
[1:08:02] charity out of a pure heart
[1:08:04] and of good conscience and of faith in
[1:08:07] other words faith
[1:08:08] unwavered notwithstanding
[1:08:12] she shall be saved in childbearing this
[1:08:14] is one that i read this one the other
[1:08:15] day and somebody
[1:08:16] asked brother branham a question but
[1:08:18] look at this
[1:08:20] what is charity charity is agape love
[1:08:23] which is the holy ghost
[1:08:25] right so a woman's not just saved
[1:08:27] because she has a baby
[1:08:28] right notwithstanding she shall be saved
[1:08:31] and childbearing if
[1:08:34] but tracy that word if is a big old word
[1:08:38] it's huge because that if it's a choice
[1:08:42] if the spirit of him that raise up jesus
[1:08:44] from the dead be in you if
[1:08:46] if they continue in faith and
[1:08:50] charity and holiness
[1:08:53] with sobriety so a woman's not gonna be
[1:08:56] saved just in childbearing but if she's
[1:08:57] born again she's definitely gonna be
[1:08:59] saved
[1:09:00] right all right because it's charity
[1:09:02] right
[1:09:03] all right here we go second timothy 2 22
[1:09:06] flee
[1:09:06] off also youthful lust that's where
[1:09:08] we're getting into the bottom part of
[1:09:10] the of the love part
[1:09:11] because a lot of us young people i said
[1:09:13] a lot of us young people confused
[1:09:16] that attraction to being just good
[1:09:18] old-fashioned love but it was just good
[1:09:20] old-fashioned lust
[1:09:21] but follow righteousness faith charity
[1:09:24] peace with them that call on the lord
[1:09:28] out of a pure heart
[1:09:32] look at verse first peter four and eight
[1:09:34] and above all things
[1:09:36] have fervent that means fiery got it
[1:09:40] have fervent charity among yourselves
[1:09:44] for charity shall cover the multitude
[1:09:47] right
[1:09:48] of sin amen charity shall cover
[1:09:52] the multitude of sin
[1:09:56] so now we understand we've got agape
[1:09:59] love
[1:10:00] we've we've got and we've got the other
[1:10:02] one
[1:10:04] and we're going to deal with those four
[1:10:06] in the coming months after we
[1:10:07] in february all of you that come to the
[1:10:10] banquet we're not going to be over 20
[1:10:12] minutes
[1:10:14] so we're not going to be under 20
[1:10:17] minutes either
[1:10:20] like a guy one time tonight told he told
[1:10:23] that
[1:10:24] police officer he said officer said i
[1:10:25] don't drink no more so don't drink no
[1:10:27] less either
[1:10:28] yeah so we're not going to preach no
[1:10:30] longer but we ain't going to freak no
[1:10:32] way
[1:10:34] but after we get started with that i
[1:10:36] kind of want us to all and you know
[1:10:38] this church is a good is a good loving
[1:10:40] church it really is i mean but we still
[1:10:41] all have our problems
[1:10:42] right man we should treat our wives
[1:10:47] like we want christ to treat us
[1:10:51] so if you treat your wife you know what
[1:10:54] i believe we're going to get in the
[1:10:55] scripture and we're going to dig into it
[1:10:56] real deep to where
[1:10:58] you treat your wife a certain way then
[1:11:00] christ
[1:11:01] can treat you the same way exactly
[1:11:06] pretty tough huh
[1:11:09] because the bible says as you love your
[1:11:11] wife
[1:11:13] christ i also love you amen pretty tough
[1:11:17] huh
[1:11:18] but that goes for everything we're going
[1:11:19] to cover those things but love
[1:11:23] charity coverth the multitude of sins
[1:11:27] why is that let's start
[1:11:28] we'll end with this thought right here
[1:11:30] why does charity cover a multitude of
[1:11:32] sin
[1:11:33] because charity is agape love you know
[1:11:35] how to handle that sin
[1:11:37] right it didn't say it's going to cover
[1:11:40] it you can keep doing it and it'll come
[1:11:41] no what it says is that we can live with
[1:11:44] each other because we sin every day
[1:11:46] but we can live with each other in our
[1:11:49] sins and trespasses things that we do
[1:11:51] wrong
[1:11:52] anything's not a god of sin right right
[1:11:57] but charity shall cover the multitude
[1:12:01] so he's talking to christians
[1:12:05] and the multitude of sins that we have
[1:12:08] if we'll take it to god with an unfeed
[1:12:10] heart
[1:12:11] read all the scriptures read all that
[1:12:13] you take it to god with an unfitting
[1:12:14] heart
[1:12:15] and you know what happens a lot of times
[1:12:18] and i want everybody to shake their head
[1:12:19] yes i'll go ahead and say yes
[1:12:21] go and say yes before i even say it yes
[1:12:24] a lot of things we do we have an
[1:12:26] ulterior motive
[1:12:28] you're going to say yes because i know
[1:12:30] you do we have a motive
[1:12:32] god if you'll do this i'll do
[1:12:35] this and don't say you that don't happen
[1:12:39] but when in maturity you shouldn't do
[1:12:40] that
[1:12:42] being a mature christian you shouldn't
[1:12:43] say god now if you'll save my kids i'll
[1:12:46] quit doing
[1:12:46] no no that's not the way to go about it
[1:12:51] god's not a he's not a traitor
[1:12:53] p-r-a-d-e-r
[1:12:54] traitor he don't trade things
[1:12:58] he said if you love me you'll keep my
[1:13:00] commandments all right
[1:13:02] period that's right if you love me
[1:13:04] you'll keep my commandments
[1:13:06] and the commandments the ten
[1:13:07] commandments to me covers this whole
[1:13:08] bible
[1:13:10] and a christian with agape love is the
[1:13:12] only person that can take all ten
[1:13:14] commandments
[1:13:15] and say god right i can do that
[1:13:18] right glory because paul says i do all
[1:13:20] things through what christ
[1:13:22] which strengthens me all right but now
[1:13:25] remember what happened to the rich young
[1:13:27] ruler
[1:13:28] the rich young ruler he did all ten
[1:13:31] commandments
[1:13:32] he said he told jesus he said i've been
[1:13:34] doing that since i was again
[1:13:35] just like what did you talk about this
[1:13:36] morning i've been going to church i read
[1:13:39] i'm in the message i do this i do this i
[1:13:41] don't do this i don't don't cut my hair
[1:13:42] i wear my paint
[1:13:43] i don't wear pants so uh man we cut our
[1:13:46] hair and
[1:13:46] we do things and and man we're just good
[1:13:49] stuff but jesus said
[1:13:50] can you do one more thing sell all you
[1:13:53] have
[1:13:55] and follow me can you sell all your love
[1:13:59] can you get rid of all that love and
[1:14:01] follow me
[1:14:02] right and you know what he couldn't do
[1:14:05] but see he
[1:14:06] he wasn't he wasn't let that boy
[1:14:09] let me let me just put it this way if
[1:14:11] that boy would have been
[1:14:12] would have been led by the holy ghost
[1:14:14] he'd have been a real good
[1:14:16] church member after the day of pentecost
[1:14:19] because he'd been filled with the holy
[1:14:20] ghost and he would have done all that he
[1:14:22] would have got rid of all the things
[1:14:23] that he had
[1:14:24] you don't have to give all your riches
[1:14:25] away and be a pulper that's not what
[1:14:26] he's talking about
[1:14:27] he said you've got to be able to follow
[1:14:29] me
[1:14:30] in charity in a gothic love and
[1:14:34] all these other loves will fall in line
[1:14:36] to that
[1:14:37] i want you to think about that when we
[1:14:39] close you stand
[1:14:55] a body change yeah go ahead
[1:14:58] and have things in our life right
[1:15:02] that are not biblical principles we're
[1:15:05] not going to have these principles
[1:15:08] wrong and take his body change right
[1:15:12] the perfection brother dale's been
[1:15:13] talking about is from within but that
[1:15:15] from within has got to work its way out
[1:15:17] there's no way that we can that we can
[1:15:20] leave this world without having
[1:15:23] the love of god it passes all
[1:15:26] understanding right
[1:15:28] the love of god that you can love the
[1:15:29] man that hates you
[1:15:33] jesus said what would he say about the
[1:15:34] greatest commandment was you love your
[1:15:36] neighbor
[1:15:37] he didn't stop there he said as you love
[1:15:40] yourself
[1:15:40] right as you love yourself
[1:15:44] hey listen i got two gay guys in his
[1:15:46] neighbor
[1:15:48] that's hard but i don't i look gin
[1:15:52] i don't i mean we don't we try not to to
[1:15:55] do anything to harm them i mean they
[1:15:57] humanly we make mistakes and our dog
[1:15:59] eats their cat or something but
[1:16:02] but and then they showed what they were
[1:16:05] now
[1:16:06] by coming and screaming in my face and
[1:16:08] pulling the guns out and all that stuff
[1:16:09] but i just said hey guys we'll take care
[1:16:11] of them
[1:16:12] we'll take care of let's get rid of the
[1:16:13] dog we'll take care of it i had no
[1:16:15] animosity toward those people i had no
[1:16:19] there was no i'll get them back oh boy
[1:16:22] in my mind
[1:16:23] i thought buddy i can walk down into
[1:16:26] that field richard and i get in them
[1:16:27] royal pines
[1:16:29] are then junipers and i can shoot them
[1:16:31] through the window
[1:16:32] now that's what went through my mind
[1:16:34] yeah but you know what
[1:16:36] showing the appearance of evil right and
[1:16:38] just love those two guys and you know
[1:16:40] what mike said one time he said you know
[1:16:41] he said a lot of people told me
[1:16:43] a lot of people have told me what y'all
[1:16:44] believe he said one day i want you to
[1:16:46] sit
[1:16:47] down on the porch and tell me what y'all
[1:16:49] believe he said because i've heard it
[1:16:50] from everybody else what y'all believe
[1:16:52] but i want to hear you tell me what you
[1:16:55] believe
[1:16:56] right yeah so you know well you know and
[1:16:59] they see it they don't see us
[1:17:01] they don't see us you know it's sunday
[1:17:03] night we take our
[1:17:04] our trash out and and you hear the beer
[1:17:06] cans you know
[1:17:09] and we do it in the dark you know
[1:17:14] i know we don't do that but i'm just
[1:17:15] making a point you know we don't as soon
[1:17:17] as they walk in
[1:17:18] you know they come in the doors then
[1:17:19] they come in the door we start hiding
[1:17:20] things
[1:17:22] no don't do that right
[1:17:25] might be a lot of dirty clothes laying
[1:17:27] around the house but but not things that
[1:17:29] somebody shouldn't see
[1:17:30] yeah i mean if we have to do that
[1:17:33] where are we at right this whole series
[1:17:36] that i want
[1:17:37] that i want to get on is is let's get
[1:17:39] back you know paul says
[1:17:40] let's go on leave the principles right
[1:17:43] you got to start the principal somewhere
[1:17:45] to leave them you got to have them to
[1:17:47] leave them
[1:17:48] right you got to have this as leaving
[1:17:50] the principle there had to be a
[1:17:52] foundation for this building to be built
[1:17:54] on
[1:17:54] right but one time you had to leave the
[1:17:56] foundation but you can't
[1:17:57] make the foundation any less important
[1:18:00] because if you drag the foundation out
[1:18:01] from under this house
[1:18:03] you take the foundation out front of
[1:18:04] this church where is it it collapses
[1:18:07] right so there's nothing that were it
[1:18:09] wasn't built on good sand it wasn't
[1:18:11] built on
[1:18:11] on the rock that's the same way with you
[1:18:14] and i
[1:18:15] let's get down to looking at each other
[1:18:18] husbands
[1:18:19] you're supposed to be the rule in your
[1:18:20] house wives you're supposed to be
[1:18:22] subject to your husband
[1:18:24] how many others can chew that we're
[1:18:27] gonna find out maybe in a few weeks
[1:18:29] what the prophet had to say about it not
[1:18:30] trying to use our own ideas because you
[1:18:32] know what
[1:18:33] brother dale doesn't do it and i don't
[1:18:34] do it either i don't tell you how to run
[1:18:35] your family
[1:18:36] god's given us enough through the
[1:18:38] prophet he's given us enough through
[1:18:40] the bible and he just give us something
[1:18:42] to just give you a little direction
[1:18:44] right on how to use it because we we'll
[1:18:47] have some new thing
[1:18:49] it's been family since the beginning of
[1:18:51] time glory right
[1:18:52] moses had lord what moses had to deal
[1:18:55] with
[1:18:56] people like that i mean mine so we
[1:18:59] it's easy for us to deal with we look
[1:19:00] like what moses and people like that had
[1:19:02] to deal with but
[1:19:03] but still i think to live a better
[1:19:05] christian life
[1:19:07] let's just get back down to the basin
[1:19:08] right let's just get down to the basics
[1:19:10] and learn how to treat each other
[1:19:11] learn how the prophet told us you know
[1:19:14] who would have guessed that a prophet
[1:19:16] would
[1:19:16] uh go into a situation one day and his
[1:19:20] wife is
[1:19:20] you know she's got her hair out he said
[1:19:23] her hair was all messed up and
[1:19:25] one uh joseph was screaming and two
[1:19:27] girls were throwing stuff
[1:19:28] and this was all over here and this was
[1:19:30] all over there you know he didn't go in
[1:19:32] and he didn't go in and go good evening
[1:19:36] friends
[1:19:41] he didn't go in and go you going over
[1:19:43] there he
[1:19:44] what he's saying what'd he do he walked
[1:19:46] in put on an apron
[1:19:50] let me give you a little hint for your
[1:19:52] wives or your husband
[1:19:53] if you want to get anywhere with your
[1:19:55] wife put on an apron
[1:19:57] yeah get you a towel out
[1:20:01] and get them up start mopping start
[1:20:04] cleaning i promise you one thing
[1:20:06] what brother brown said he done though
[1:20:08] it changed the whole atmosphere he said
[1:20:10] all of a sudden
[1:20:11] the kids started calming down
[1:20:15] well you get a spirit an atmosphere
[1:20:17] we're gods we're creators we can create
[1:20:19] an atmosphere and that's what we're
[1:20:20] going to try to do is try to create an
[1:20:21] atmosphere
[1:20:22] that god can come and there not be
[1:20:25] any holes or any bars or anything that
[1:20:28] we have to go
[1:20:30] i need to hide this or i need to do no
[1:20:33] we need to walk right on up with god be
[1:20:35] a christian
[1:20:36] glory don't be just a christian when
[1:20:38] somebody's looking at you
[1:20:40] be a christian even when somebody's not
[1:20:41] looking at you let's buy all of this
[1:20:43] the heavenly father we pray lord that
[1:20:45] what we've said today would
[1:20:46] would be satisfactory to you lord
[1:20:50] we're just humans trying to live here on
[1:20:53] the earth lord until you
[1:20:55] take us out in the chain but father
[1:20:57] we're not supposed to live here and just
[1:20:59] be living per se
[1:21:01] day to day with no direction and nothing
[1:21:03] to do and
[1:21:04] and nothing to accomplish father you put
[1:21:06] us on the earth and give us the holy
[1:21:08] ghost
[1:21:09] to get us back under that holy ghost
[1:21:11] veil and get us out of this
[1:21:12] not just lush for for the opposite sex
[1:21:15] but lust for other things like lust for
[1:21:17] cars and
[1:21:19] money and all the things popularity the
[1:21:21] things of the world
[1:21:23] lord may our desire our desire and our
[1:21:27] joy be that agape love lord that
[1:21:31] passes all understanding a love that
[1:21:33] that we truly don't understand without
[1:21:35] you coming and giving your life
[1:21:37] to bring that back to the individual we
[1:21:40] would have never understood it
[1:21:42] but now lord through your scripture and
[1:21:44] through your prophet to come in the end
[1:21:45] time and lord through the fivefold
[1:21:46] ministry we're
[1:21:48] able now to understand truly
[1:21:51] the love of god that's sent abroad among
[1:21:54] all the people and all the earth but
[1:21:56] lord we've accepted it
[1:21:58] we pray lord the ones that have not
[1:22:00] accepted that love that you would fill
[1:22:02] them with the holy ghost now lord
[1:22:04] that you would make that list that we
[1:22:05] have downstairs lord may it shrink

[1:22:10] may people be
[1:22:11] be lord brought into the family of god
[1:22:16] not into a church family or a natural
[1:22:18] family but lord
[1:22:19] into a spiritual family a family that
[1:22:22] where there's harmony and peace
[1:22:24] a family where there's communion lord
[1:22:26] and it's communion with you father
[1:22:29] we pray lord that you would just abide
[1:22:31] with us lord give us

[1:22:37] the earth father we ask you lord to
[1:22:40] forgive us of our many sins and our
[1:22:41] mistakes and failures
[1:22:43] the wrong ideas that we have toward any
[1:22:46] person or anything lord
[1:22:48] that you would just circumcise our heart
[1:22:49] father that you would bless us lord with
[1:22:52] your holy spirit lord
[1:22:53] that love that oh lord we love our wife

[1:23:13] no more
[1:23:15] but that we would see you yes and the
[1:23:17] world would see you through us
[1:23:20] the lord as john 3 16 says for god so
[1:23:23] loved the world
[1:23:24] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:23:27] whosoever shall believe in him should
[1:23:28] never perish
[1:23:29] but have everlasting life lord i pray
[1:23:32] that if one person here this morning
[1:23:34] that does not this afternoon that does
[1:23:35] not have that
[1:23:37] lord in their heart to realize that you
[1:23:40] love this world so much that you died
[1:23:42] for it
[1:23:43] and you sit back your life with the holy
[1:23:45] ghost into the group of people
[1:23:47] and lord now we've come to the end of
[1:23:48] time where the we're now
[1:23:50] truly going back this is the last group
[1:23:52] that heading back to the garden of eden
[1:23:54] father
[1:23:55] and all the other ages and all the other
[1:23:57] sages are waiting on us lord all the
[1:23:59] prophets
[1:24:00] everybody's waiting on us to come to a
[1:24:02] place lord and if we can't live just a
[1:24:04] good christian life lord
[1:24:07] with all without all the mysteries lord
[1:24:09] you said even there's we read in
[1:24:10] corinthians if we should know of could
[1:24:12] know
[1:24:12] all mysteries but not have charity it

[1:24:16] lord we want it to profit something we
[1:24:18] want this word lord you said it wouldn't
[1:24:20] return board but it would accomplish
[1:24:22] that which has been sent out to do lord
[1:24:24] you said it
[1:24:26] we believe it and lord now we ask it to
[1:24:27] be made manifest in all of our hearts
[1:24:29] and lives in jesus name
[1:24:31] amen let's sing a song about eight seven
[1:24:35] eight seven in the red book blessing the
[1:24:42] word
[1:24:53] i know
[1:25:24] is
[1:25:38] is
[1:25:52] everyday
[1:26:05] will be
[1:26:49] we ought to be asking god hey fill me
[1:26:52] with love
[1:26:54] and not just love for like we were
[1:26:56] talking about but no we want the epitome
[1:26:58] of love but god be loved we want the
[1:27:00] love of god
[1:27:01] and the only way you can get it is
[1:27:04] listening
[1:27:07] reading your bible and praying that's
[1:27:10] what we didn't get
[1:27:11] ken you can't buy it doctor's not going
[1:27:14] to pour it out on you wish you did
[1:27:17] but there's certain things that we do
[1:27:18] that we commit ourselves just like we
[1:27:20] commit ourselves to a relationship
[1:27:22] with our with our spouse and just like
[1:27:24] we commit ourselves to our spouse we
[1:27:25] have to commit ourselves with a
[1:27:26] relationship with god
[1:27:28] right we have to commit ourselves hey
[1:27:31] i'm not playing with nobody else i'm not
[1:27:32] fooling around with anything
[1:27:34] else i'm not fooling around with the
[1:27:36] devil i'm not fooling around with the
[1:27:37] things of the world
[1:27:39] you know you take that vow i was
[1:27:42] thinking about it the other day
[1:27:43] you know we say it's till death do us
[1:27:45] part in our natural vow
[1:27:51] what about spiritual about right now
[1:27:52] that's right still death to us
[1:27:56] and i ain't talking about physical death
[1:27:59] brother dale said about this
[1:28:00] remember remember the only person that
[1:28:02] you can't that you can't um
[1:28:06] commute sin to or impute sin too it's a
[1:28:08] dead person right
[1:28:10] a dead man you can't get my grandpa
[1:28:13] which was been dead for
[1:28:16] 60 70 years
[1:28:19] he can't rob a bank tomorrow he didn't
[1:28:22] rob a bank 20 years ago
[1:28:24] what so if you accused him of that what
[1:28:26] he's justified
[1:28:28] because he never did it in the first
[1:28:30] place
[1:28:31] if somebody accused him and that's what
[1:28:33] satan that's what we got to realize
[1:28:34] satan has accused us of doing something
[1:28:36] that we say hey man we're dead we're
[1:28:39] dead we didn't do that
[1:28:41] we're dead but we just can't say that we
[1:28:44] got to be dead in christ
[1:28:46] and be a new creature our new creation i
[1:28:49] like that word creation
[1:28:50] right because we're a part of a new
[1:28:52] creation a new race
[1:28:54] that has never been on this earth before
[1:28:58] do you realize that glory there's never
[1:29:01] been a race of people
[1:29:02] on the earth like right now
[1:29:06] because you and i are staring a body
[1:29:08] change in the face
[1:29:09] and somebody is going to do it
[1:29:12] no other aids how great it was
[1:29:18] they can't handle it they can't handle
[1:29:20] it
