[12:52] can drive up and be with us and
[12:54] fellowship with us budget looking
[12:55] forward to a good time right Galatians 1
[12:59] 1 through 3 how do we thank you Lord for
[13:02] your love and your grace unto us thank
[13:04] you for you we thank you for the day and
[13:07] the hour that we're living in the time
[13:09] that we have fun you most of all and if
[13:13] you for revealing yourself unto us so
[13:17] what would we be what worth would they
[13:18] be in this life if we gained all of the
[13:22] money all of the we'll all the things
[13:24] that could be done in life what would it
[13:27] be but we would face the time that we
[13:30] would be no more but yet lower than you
[13:33] we know that we face an eternity nor
[13:37] that's a wonderful opportunity we love
[13:39] in we thinking we ask you now to just be
[13:41] with us as we read your word you come
[13:44] and speak to our hearts
[13:46] or just let your light shine in each one
[13:48] of us in Jesus name revelations one the
[13:58] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[14:00] gave it to him to shew unto his servants
[14:03] things which must shortly come to pass
[14:04] and he sent and signified it by his
[14:07] angel unto his servant John who by
[14:11] record of the word of God and the
[14:12] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[14:14] things that he saw as it is he that
[14:17] readeth and they that hear the words of
[14:19] this prophecy and keep those things
[14:21] which are written therein for the time
[14:24] is that any have you may be seated or
[14:26] that is blessing the time to understand
[14:31] if your opponent's you know so we just
[14:34] appreciate gardening is revealing
[14:37] yourself like I said we we talk about
[14:40] the book of revelations and we know that
[14:42] that it's written in symbols but yet God
[14:46] has given us say an ability to be able
[14:49] to understand the symbols because he
[14:52] gave us a profit to bring those symbols
[14:54] to us and speak the simplicity and to
[14:57] meet us that's the greatest of all
[15:00] things that's ever been to me about this
[15:01] message if I told you many times about
[15:04] it what caught my attention and I
[15:07] wouldn't know theologian but I have a
[15:10] decent understanding of the letter of
[15:13] the word because that's what we read it
[15:15] he didn't emphasize too much on other
[15:18] things we emphasized on getting a gold
[15:22] star for every time you could read about
[15:24] through you know so he's done that you
[15:26] know
[15:27] will but the point was to me when the
[15:30] Prophet begin to explain things it was
[15:34] just so simple yeah man that's right no
[15:38] it's like you I said about the stoning
[15:41] over the stomach stone this year 100
[15:43] you're on the football field 100 yards
[15:45] long 50 yards wide or something and
[15:48] they've won stole my car and you're
[15:50] looking for it and you stumble around
[15:51] fall all over the funny trying to find
[15:53] it you know and that's about as dumb as
[15:56] we all were and our thinking and doings
[15:59] but you know the prophet comes up said
[16:01] you don't have to interpret it he said
[16:04] just take it for what it is and believe
[16:06] it absolutely that simple to us you know
[16:09] to bring it down to an understanding all
[16:11] right now you remember the thing that
[16:13] we've talked about also in the the point
[16:17] of that in the Book of Revelations the
[16:21] bride is shown you know that is her book
[16:24] and it's showing her because according
[16:28] to Christ mr. God revealed the Prophet
[16:31] said the bride is also to be revealed
[16:33] well then we're seeing ourselves in the
[16:36] book but odd to be C is we're not trying
[16:39] to find ourselves in the other well call
[16:41] that's fine they had their day and we
[16:43] can associate with it but we're trying
[16:45] to find ourselves in the book that we
[16:47] were told to stay away from right so you
[16:50] can see what a Satan has tried to to
[16:52] hinder us and understanding the book of
[16:55] Revelation because in that we can see
[16:57] our very day an hour that we're living
[17:00] upon the earth and the things you know
[17:02] that we are here and we we thank God for
[17:06] that now but we we covered up now until
[17:11] we started into chapter 4 and I pray
[17:16] that you just keep reading it and over
[17:17] and over and jot down your little
[17:19] culture along the way and we'll finish
[17:21] up with chapter 4 we're going to chapter
[17:24] 5 right now this past Sunday we spent
[17:28] actually two services bringing a point
[17:33] to you are trying to get
[17:34] point to us then the ride will go up in
[17:39] Revelations for one all right and then
[17:44] not seen until the 19th chapter I tried
[17:47] you say yes but brother their wares
[17:49] revelations 10-7 don't you think that's
[17:52] the prophets message that's exactly
[17:55] right right it is the prophets miss you
[17:58] this product this message is going to
[18:01] Israel when we get out of here and it
[18:05] will leave the prophets match the Osprey
[18:06] those two witnesses will pick right up
[18:08] and they'll have a wonderful background
[18:10] because you know I wouldn't doubt what
[18:13] they're not here right now on the
[18:14] summers tried to make it this man in
[18:16] that man who's worried about it no we're
[18:18] not going to be here to look at I don't
[18:20] want to go I don't matter me who it is
[18:22] that's right but if it would be anything
[18:25] I can do the happy to get it understand
[18:27] it now how did you do that but I do that
[18:29] with anybody you know I mean I wouldn't
[18:31] I wouldn't have no problems with we're
[18:33] trying to help anybody to get a an
[18:35] understanding of God because that's
[18:37] that's the thing that's always been in
[18:39] my heart alright is to try to help
[18:42] others but now we saw that so I just put
[18:44] about three little quotes back into
[18:47] where that we wouldn't you know have any
[18:50] problems and connect it together and
[18:52] somebody getting this message and
[18:54] doesn't get the the one before or
[18:56] whatever then it's hard to for them to
[18:59] be able to understand what we're talking
[19:02] about that's right see if I just left it
[19:04] there with that revelation for one we go
[19:07] up don't come back to nineteen
[19:08] twenty-one I'll kind of doctor and they
[19:10] got you know well then we just show that
[19:13] where the prophet is telling those sunny
[19:15] my toe on the brother Anderson I said
[19:17] tonight we may be jumping from one to
[19:20] ten to eight to folder if that's the
[19:22] numbers of this none of the quotes but
[19:25] try not to but i wanna i got a couple of
[19:29] thoughts in my mind that i want us to
[19:32] see and then we'll keep moving on and do
[19:35] it so let's forge number one of the
[19:38] notes we were using this pass
[19:40] undie and and look at what the Prophet
[19:43] says this is papered from the fifth seal
[19:46] 1963 322 paragraph 87 but the reason
[19:51] that he reveals that as I understand
[19:54] that it is because of the mystery of the
[19:57] book of addiction and luck as far as the
[20:00] Antichrist being revealed that's right
[20:04] now watch and it's a sign of time the
[20:08] church is going up now the Antichrist
[20:13] being revealed right now the Antichrist
[20:19] is not made known as the man of sin
[20:23] sitting in the temple of God to fulfill
[20:26] the first seal of the Antichrist not
[20:31] until we go out of here in rapture and a
[20:34] strut around them that question you know
[20:36] well first Thessalonians their male
[20:38] sensitive let fulfill the functions that
[20:41] yet all right so now we are seeing being
[20:46] what Israel will get because the
[20:50] Antichrist is revealed to us right see
[20:56] now literally he'll stand up nice that's
[20:58] right yes but he has to go through the
[21:01] stages of Antichrist spirit form a false
[21:06] prophet which will get back to in the
[21:08] church ages when we do cover a little
[21:10] bit the chapter five and then he becomes
[21:13] incarnate false prophet and then he can
[21:15] become the beasts that's if stages are
[21:18] the four four beasts they come up right
[21:22] but look what the prophet is saying be
[21:25] here as we come to revelations for one
[21:29] then the book of the mr. ridiculous
[21:34] party to end across leader of evil is
[21:37] made known to you not sure
[21:40] right no matter it's made known right
[21:43] now that's what's happening here all
[21:45] right now and what and at the same time
[21:48] to church is normal and these things
[21:52] don't even happen in the church age at
[21:54] all that's right there away from the
[21:56] church in the church absolutely
[21:58] fractured at this time the church goes
[22:01] up in the fourth chapter of Revelation
[22:03] and does not return until it comes back
[22:05] with skin in the nineteenth chapter but
[22:08] these seals here are revealing one has
[22:11] been what is in what will be like
[22:15] everything is revealed in the seals all
[22:17] right now the bride has been given the
[22:19] seal that was the prophets message was
[22:22] to start there in 63 then to bring us
[22:27] his message the other was a restoration
[22:30] back into what would be known as the
[22:32] faith of the Father room 47 everywhere
[22:35] you want to start with it you know
[22:36] forty-sevens when they started keeping
[22:38] the taste her whole hand ability to hold
[22:41] it tight until 62 and the lies he was
[22:45] dealing with bring in the face of the
[22:47] Father Capricia what they were bringing
[22:50] my honor then he brought his message
[22:52] he's the Nugget in the years rapture
[22:54] minutes 90 years of preparation we said
[22:56] when he begins to sign right alright so
[22:59] they brought the prophets message begin
[23:01] their through the opening of the seal
[23:03] and going through the last seizure so
[23:05] then the sealed is going to really no
[23:07] one has been what it is and what will be
[23:10] and you're not have the Bride of Christ
[23:12] we look back at the Garden of Eden run
[23:15] and we see what happened in the garden
[23:21] probably do you say like is he said
[23:23] cerfancy what what happened in the
[23:25] garden what started that he's it is
[23:28] revealed in the sealed so we see what
[23:32] was the beginning we see I'm saying we
[23:36] the bride we see what's taking place now
[23:41] we see that is getting very close for
[23:44] that hope to walk into a covenant with
[23:48] the Antichrist I mean the Jews and the
[23:54] Gentiles in the basis of the Antichrist
[23:57] movement of hope in vases is just coming
[24:00] closer and closer and closer I try until
[24:03] you know it could happen at any time and
[24:07] you know yourself now be sensible you
[24:11] wouldn't you don't just start something
[24:13] you're doing because even many many many
[24:15] years ago I showed you this is probably
[24:17] 30 35 years ago that the Catholic Church
[24:21] is not in the World Council church but
[24:24] you all right but they have
[24:29] representatives that you know what's
[24:34] happened we we start dealing with you
[24:36] know we hear something that if you're
[24:38] going to make a sign a deal with some
[24:40] country over her when I letting go there
[24:42] yesterday and sit down and write out all
[24:45] of the stuff give a sense about that
[24:48] with the Bible and understand for years
[24:52] they deal on those things they're trying
[24:54] to work out all of the problems and then
[24:58] when we begin to see it it's already
[25:00] almost into a fact you know well see
[25:05] that's the way Satan does that add the
[25:10] christ covenant is already close to
[25:12] being made with Israel as a nation
[25:16] another 144,000 will come out of that
[25:19] and they're not counted as the nation
[25:22] while we're here on earth you know
[25:24] they're counting 144,000 which would be
[25:26] units to the bride all right see we see
[25:30] what has been what he is and what will
[25:32] they ever we see all the way to the
[25:34] future home the previous message has
[25:38] been delivered to you and I and we can
[25:40] see all the way to Revelation 21 22 and
[25:43] see what's going to be even what the
[25:46] city of the
[25:47] uh you know that's right because that's
[25:51] his bride no he's not going to withhold
[25:55] anything from no now you may have kept a
[25:59] few secrets from your wife before you
[26:01] marry her but basically you told
[26:03] everyone all right I know right you
[26:07] basically through the years of courtship
[26:10] for time of courtship you basically told
[26:13] your wife what to expect right you know
[26:16] and getting ready for everything all
[26:19] right now so think about those signs
[26:21] then you will see what's taking place so
[26:25] the bride does did she goes up
[26:27] revelations for one she's not single
[26:29] 1921 that's right but that's what I said
[26:31] everybody said but what you made
[26:33] revelations Tim Sabbath I stood and I
[26:39] expressed that to you I've done that for
[26:42] 30-something years when I'm excuse me
[26:44] I'd say about 20 years on that really or
[26:46] more on that in emphasis in essence I'm
[26:50] trying to explain it that John when he
[26:53] got up the dark he was wondering how he
[26:55] was going to get what he was a saying
[26:57] back to the church but he wasn't told
[27:00] her to to write this book of revelations
[27:02] to the world right collector chapter one
[27:07] write this and send it to the church I
[27:10] even named the ones that was to be sent
[27:13] that's right where it would come down to
[27:15] me and correspond with the ages that
[27:19] would come down right leave and that was
[27:23] going to be set to not in the world the
[27:27] world can't understand the book around
[27:28] the world can't understand Genesis 1 MA
[27:31] amen that's right away come on they
[27:36] can't do it
[27:37] the cameras there another have a few
[27:39] were born again we can and we quote a
[27:42] lot I say we go one better and said but
[27:48] does that mean we understand now see you
[27:52] doing that BIM coming up to where we are
[27:56] see then the prophet said john was
[28:00] looking and he said how can i get this
[28:02] back to the church when he realized
[28:05] something that happened that he had been
[28:07] taken from the church ages and he was
[28:10] riding to the message to you know and
[28:14] about each age is he wrote chapter 2 and
[28:16] 3 and they said how can they get that
[28:19] backpack so the key was the word but
[28:25] he's standing on how can I get this back
[28:27] bear to them but in the days of the
[28:29] Sabbath angel the angel to come in the
[28:34] Lady of cmh not the beginning of it but
[28:38] the ending of the age the dimension
[28:41] jerwood come now he seems that that
[28:43] messenger will be a prophet heaven and
[28:47] he says glory glory glory man yep you
[28:51] look up when you get time just go home I
[28:54] look it up the other day mr. Jacob loop
[28:56] but just look up the word but it's got a
[28:58] lot of good means to you know because
[29:02] it's a it's the word expressing in other
[29:05] words showing at that time or this is
[29:10] right this is something going to happen
[29:11] right just look at it on mccoll now
[29:15] let's go to number two and then number
[29:17] three will will read these and then
[29:19] we'll get into a message you or him with
[29:20] number two this is from the Feast of the
[29:22] trumpets 1964 719 the mornin serve our
[29:26] graph 36 37 the first three chapters the

[30:37] and there is also a sixth chapter of our
[30:40] there was a fourth chapter of Revelation

[32:41] Helen who worries about that that may be
[32:43] part of that tribulation but it needs a
[32:45] great trip last night the elite
[32:47] revelation is the wrath of God we're at
[32:50] pre tribulation we're if you're a
[32:53] horrible time around the world right but
[32:57] we're not in the big privilege you may
[32:59] not be here then cause you're proud of

[33:34] come to Tom grace yes sir what about
[33:38] that that's vishal an animal you know I
[33:40] mean I wonder brother I'm city without
[33:42] the Holy Ghost ain't nothing but an
[33:43] animal that's right yeah but how do you
[33:45] see what I'm talking about yes the bride
[33:49] comes in the rapture there everything
[33:52] all right in the fourth chapter a bad
[33:54] burn that why she doesn't have to go
[33:56] through the tribulation the fullest
[34:01] version does because she does not have
[34:03] the baptism of the Holy Ghost as the new
[34:05] birth you see what I say it as the new
[34:08] burger you may have it as an anointing
[34:10] may be that kind of a win but not as the
[34:13] new birth alright so that I she misses
[34:16] it you know and we can see it but as I
[34:20] said it let me save again see you say
[34:21] but with brother Dale I can't understand
[34:24] how come you don't want real nice again
[34:26] I didn't move that license 10-7 I even
[34:31] showed you where brother Brown said that
[34:34] revelations 10-1 about money angel is
[34:40] the same as revelations uh 113 right one
[34:45] standing in the midst of seven gold
[34:47] against o'clock another son of man
[34:48] burned about the back true no do we
[34:51] believe what he says he didn't are you
[34:55] mad at me cuz i found what he's saying
[34:57] you know or are offended at me because
[35:00] you know that i say these tiny them will
[35:02] do you know well that's all right I'm
[35:05] not worried about it but main time to
[35:06] make know a great thing it away I'm
[35:10] trying to beat one thing used of God to
[35:13] try to break the scriptures and the
[35:14] prophets message down to were you and I
[35:17] can understand it right we don't have
[35:20] the Holy Ghost with Nate lenders name
[35:22] for the greatest thing in the world for
[35:24] any money is the bad kids man
[35:26] all right now that ought to be settled
[35:29] with one thing in our hearts and our
[35:31] life ok now the prophet of God then John
[35:35] being who he was he could look back to
[35:38] the seventh church age angel you know
[35:41] the ending up and he could see that
[35:45] there would have been ability to tape
[35:47] the rest of what he would be talking
[35:50] about even in heaven you remember I gave
[35:54] it to you there we run around said that
[35:56] this was something like Paul's
[35:58] experience Oh John hadn't experienced my
[36:00] Paul see Paul was taken up and he
[36:04] couldn't describe what he saw but John
[36:09] was taken up and told her write down
[36:11] what he saw but now we know he wrote it
[36:14] down in symbols be all right knowing
[36:20] then it would be a prophet to come in
[36:22] the Leister age to be able to expound
[36:26] upon the symbols so they would you see
[36:30] what they mean I brother ousted the heat
[36:33] pump the book of Hebrews all right did
[36:35] he use the old testament in the symbolic
[36:39] you know the thing even says that John
[36:42] uses those things in the writing of the
[36:44] book of revised you use a lot of the Old
[36:47] Testament forms to break it night like
[36:51] I've always tried to tell you the name
[36:53] and he looks up and he sees tarius
[36:57] joslyn in the street
[37:00] well he may have seen 85 or 285 he hung
[37:07] it with him buick slowly over hills and
[37:10] Pontiacs and cataracts and the Zeus is
[37:12] everybody now running together and just
[37:14] you know right I happening room if I
[37:18] some torches like mine you know what
[37:22] good comeback right I saw a Buick and I
[37:25] saw an old mobile he's mean even seen
[37:30] the word he couldn't wrote it now cuz
[37:32] wouldn't even the word available for it
[37:34] man join wrote one what he saw if I
[37:39] cherish Jocelyn in the street but then
[37:45] it would come down to where we were the
[37:47] Prophet would expel the second on the
[37:49] gusset are here this place and those
[37:53] symbols are therapy but we've had that
[37:57] the one to break this in here man i'm
[37:59] handing all honor and glory to the Lord
[38:00] Jesus Christ but he did send the
[38:03] messenger right he did send a messenger
[38:07] right okay so now we covered what we
[38:11] were doing this for words chapter for
[38:13] now we'll go we'll reverse 1 and 2 i'm
[38:17] chuck before the revelation and then
[38:20] we'll just get into something and try to
[38:22] move on a little bit tonight so after
[38:26] this but after the church ages right oh
[38:29] I looked and behold a door was opened in
[38:34] heaven and we covered that what that's
[38:37] the Lord is Lord Jesus
[38:38] i iron and heaven we didn't spend that
[38:43] much time on it but heaven is where God
[38:45] he is all right now now listen here's
[38:51] the one caution a lot of people wants to
[38:56] go into the Book of Revelations and they
[38:59] can bring you beautiful soundings and
[39:01] college all right I said beautiful
[39:04] family in the top it off let me enjoy
[39:08] but let's don't be so spiritual until we
[39:13] spiritual eyes every time that's right
[39:15] and do away with reality right you know
[39:20] there's people that believe that we're
[39:23] not going to go in the rapture in a
[39:25] glorified body we're going to be in some
[39:27] form of the otha new spiritual form you
[39:30] know and and the whole body is going to
[39:32] drop to the ground and be out in the ice
[39:34] is in some way we connect back to it
[39:37] over in the future home or somewhere I
[39:39] don't understand never could understand
[39:41] what I heard but see when you want to
[39:45] single out we will take the simple we
[39:47] got it we got it that doors Jesus Christ
[39:53] they ain't no door in heaven that doors
[39:59] down here I stood
[40:03] except you just put the wrong word in
[40:05] that they ain't no door in heaven just
[40:09] remember the only way you can get to
[40:12] heaven is by Jesus Christ who is the
[40:15] door and the only heaven there he is is
[40:18] where God is that so don't do away with
[40:20] watched our but let's no wait till we
[40:27] all get better understand what that is
[40:30] true see we can understand it here
[40:35] because it always the connection between
[40:37] the two one to watch what he's going on
[40:39] back in the first voice which I heard
[40:42] rumor as of a trumpet talking with me
[40:45] which said come up hither I'll show thee
[40:46] things which must be here after in other
[40:49] words Astrid is all right we went
[40:51] through the voice the same voice that
[40:53] calls you tell you to turn around the
[40:54] new birth the same voice to call you up
[40:56] but that voice is up that's right you
[41:00] said no it's just calling them out of
[41:01] the world hey man that ought to be the
[41:03] new earth the new birth or to start us
[41:06] out of this world and then the statue of
[41:09] a perfect man is still growing hill on
[41:11] the earth right we're going up we're
[41:12] hearing the voice but one day we will go
[41:15] up good we're not going to be like what
[41:18] is it the jungle witnesses we're gonna
[41:20] be just the basic thought is you'll be
[41:22] around here on earth and you know you
[41:24] building cars and you Mazzy paulson and
[41:27] you stay extended cuz he's fussing at
[41:29] you for missing something and the next
[41:31] day the box are happy you're happy we're
[41:34] still building cars you said no I don't
[41:37] believe it like whoa why not I believe
[41:42] we're going to be going on right here no
[41:43] it's unnatural uber right of course
[41:45] they've got a good doctor if you know
[41:50] their doctor they believe this group of
[41:52] people down here is you one is going to
[41:54] be going through this but that gray
[41:57] called out 144,000 they believe is the
[42:02] ones down to time
[42:04] they're going to be at the heaven I just
[42:10] got lost writer than you because they
[42:13] told spiritual they don't make me stay
[42:16] down here we're so related they're going
[42:21] up there well I thought we believe that
[42:25] we was going up there with God and I
[42:27] thought that would be people live down
[42:28] here right Clinton they've got scripture
[42:31] were just lining up wrong right you said
[42:33] any what too late brother did go find
[42:35] you wouldn't ask you to that what he
[42:36] believes then you come back say well you
[42:38] don't you said buddy buddy little
[42:41] difficulty letting election book so you
[42:42] won't you just want you won't worry
[42:44] about it but now think about it so let's
[42:47] go to verse 2 now for tonight and
[42:51] immediately I was in the spirit now if
[42:53] you've noticed that's four times in the
[42:55] Book of Revelations i'm pretty sure
[42:58] where you talk about being in the spirit
[43:01] story last year it isn't and behold a
[43:05] throne was set in heaven and one sat on
[43:10] the throne right right now we're going
[43:15] to be dealing with a two-part thing
[43:18] first the throne
[43:23] all right then the one sitting on the
[43:28] throne
[43:33] now what is that throne in heaven now
[43:41] remember you want watch it dominical I
[43:43] repeated what do you mean brother Dale
[43:46] withdrawn God is in my heart well amen
[43:49] if you know what you're talking about
[43:51] i'm a men in the statement that's right
[43:53] i'm not a men and what your thought is
[43:55] about it I'm not agreeing with your
[43:58] thought because a lot of people have the
[44:00] thoughts in there no heaven it's all
[44:03] right here and I harm will worse the
[44:06] future home going to bed I'm all right
[44:09] here at heart we're gonna play hearts
[44:12] and set on clouds there will be no
[44:14] clouds because that has to do with the
[44:16] other part certainly it would be no
[44:19] harsh so we gonna I guess I don't have
[44:21] it money Dean you know I you ever you
[44:24] ever played an imaginary guitar for the
[44:30] dick these brothers can display these
[44:32] guitars my brother Chris come along
[44:35] display all the signs the hand at
[44:38] Camilla but you know in my mind I can
[44:41] beat everyone and I never yes enough in
[44:48] my mind beautiful piece of machinery but
[44:54] I can't get out of the way down on the
[44:58] word supposed to be done all right now
[45:00] let's do it but we're going to be
[45:03] dealing with a two part now like we
[45:06] dealt with chapter verse one where he
[45:09] said there was an open door and i
[45:12] thought was crouched and a voice and
[45:16] there was a voice of Christ whose any
[45:19] problems with that now the cottage to
[45:22] one person yes listening the profit
[45:25] today if he would say you know talking
[45:27] about in the church a smooth how did
[45:29] people think from their doctrines he
[45:31] says they're not just
[45:32] God he said that's what we're trying to
[45:36] explain the dim Jews won't have a father
[45:39] son Holy Ghost doctor but is there
[45:43] because you can't take that to them
[45:44] because they don't believe in that girl
[45:47] right but then that you will tell you
[45:51] that that the Messiah will be a human
[45:53] person born right but he knows that's
[45:57] God that will be glad standing on earth
[46:04] Brad he knows that I don't make two
[46:06] three guards out it neither does it make
[46:09] a worthless because he can understand
[46:13] that there's regarded heaven to speak
[46:16] and not like people think we don't of
[46:19] what that was is gardens up in heaven
[46:21] and Jesus was a ventriloquist you don't
[46:23] even god you're speaking of heaven yo
[46:27] her dad and mom coming up but now listen
[46:35] that's wrong No
[46:42] that's wrong started on earth no no
[46:52] and then has to be a reality in heaven
[46:55] right you say well you don't think is
[46:58] reality now sure do to my heart great
[47:02] thing but you have to take it all to be
[47:06] in my heart of nowheres else would mess
[47:09] up everything just as much as if you put
[47:13] it all in heaven and had nothing in your
[47:16] heart what would you be right you prick
[47:20] it all put it up in the head and have
[47:23] nothing in your heart are you taking it
[47:25] all in your heart but nothing up in
[47:27] heaven what do you got you sure left out
[47:30] a whole lot you left out a great
[47:35] understanding or so then God strong is
[47:41] right here in our heart that's right
[47:42] amen but they'll come on the day of
[47:45] Pentecost David we wasn't born with it
[47:49] in us it had to come on the dead kitty
[47:52] cox doctor ahora the new birth now it
[47:58] was in Jesus Christ the very throne of
[48:03] God was a very heart of the Lord Jesus
[48:07] Christ and it being back then when he
[48:14] came on to death henikoff he would dwell
[48:17] in our sole the village eternal I've
[48:21] ever and then the pool starts to
[48:25] carrying us in an upward form but one
[48:29] day we'll leave this earth amen that's
[48:32] right
[48:34] no i told you i'll give you a kia once
[48:38] you want so when i'd say i'll give you a
[48:42] little kill much while I pay attention
[48:43] watch Nixon be saying all right so if
[48:47] you take a little kid once won't think
[48:48] about it then the Bride of Christ has
[48:54] got a lot to do with it that we're
[48:58] talking about half am the bride of Jesus
[49:01] Christ not to church world old man
[49:03] that's right they got her place but the
[49:06] bride of Jesus Christ and got a lot to
[49:08] do with a man huh so we're think about
[49:12] but now note there was a throne said in
[49:21] heaven
[49:26] now
[49:30] on the day of Pentecost that throne
[49:34] started on earth
[49:41] but now listen
[49:44] did the throne start on earth and then
[49:47] go to heaven or the throne started in
[49:49] heaven and come to earth now what do you
[49:52] think I think it was in heaven first
[49:58] because according to my understanding of
[50:01] the Bible Jesus Christ supposed to be a
[50:04] slant a lane slain before the foundation
[50:06] of the world and from my understanding
[50:10] of what I've been trying to bring to you
[50:12] that what we're reading is now in heaven
[50:23] so then he was brought from heaven to
[50:25] earth that's right the throne of god was
[50:32] brought from heaven to earth the throne
[50:36] of god was the Lord Jesus Christ you
[50:39] greet them the very heart soul being
[50:43] person at all of the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:47] did you understand all that far so being
[50:52] person that's why Jesus could say over
[50:58] there in you know after his resurrection
[51:00] he said all power given under heaven and
[51:03] earth I know we got it here somewhere
[51:05] real wrestling and arson then you got
[51:08] ain't got no power he's the DJ powerless
[51:11] talk unless you can see the both the
[51:14] side of an nothing since I their psyche
[51:17] dammit then you see where things that so
[51:21] the true understanding is one God man so
[51:27] now if I don't read anything i'll give
[51:28] you these notes later in the dinner
[51:30] because I want I told him I said I which
[51:33] led go I know I'll find out a little bit
[51:37] and I'm go anyway I feel you bear with
[51:40] me but you see the throne of god was in
[51:47] the heart of the Lord Jesus Christ when
[51:51] he said the kingdom is within their
[51:54] argument over here with an old r was it
[51:56] in him or what he was the king he was
[52:00] the key and he was the kingdom when he
[52:05] was here on earth God lived on the
[52:09] throne amen
[52:13] in the heart of the Lord Jesus Christ
[52:15] you that He gave His life to release the
[52:23] life of God let that laughs of God could
[52:30] come back into you and I look huh see
[52:41] then when he died he said I hands I
[52:46] commend my spirit when he died he went
[52:50] up right
[52:57] and the Corporal body of Jesus Christ is
[53:00] on the throne in the heaven event that's
[53:03] what we just seen have been one sitting
[53:06] on from now I've always saying I don't
[53:13] want Courtland forgive me but always say
[53:15] that it's not a lifeless body weight now
[53:22] my Bible says by giving you the other
[53:24] day jesus said I go to prepare a place
[53:26] for me if ever you say well that's right
[53:29] in here that's right they gotta be
[53:31] something dire that's identical to this
[53:33] year we don't go back right so don't
[53:37] make it all here don't make it all right
[53:39] make it to a god wants it he gave his
[53:44] wife that it could come back in you and
[53:50] I and bring the throne of god and the
[53:55] bat gives them of the Holy Ghost into
[53:59] our sole right to give us eternal life
[54:04] no
[54:07] but we only receive guarantees is that
[54:12] the Bible right here are nice to marry
[54:14] her amen you got the prophets
[54:17] maintenance we all miss Reeve an artist
[54:18] that's right we'll see something's
[54:22] pulling us yes sir you look behind its
[54:25] stature perfect man you're going to get
[54:27] it faith and you look up the top you'll
[54:31] see love that's pulling it right drawing
[54:35] you now Joe Billy the drone that we're
[54:43] seeing in heaven started on earth
[54:54] damn when it left the heaven there is
[54:59] what's wrong
[55:04] you say little more than literal why
[55:09] because Jesus Christ raised in a
[55:11] glorified body you agreed so then the
[55:15] throne would be more than literal right
[55:17] you won't argue with us about the
[55:19] pointer well we think you ain't literal
[55:21] well I believe it is and more than
[55:24] literal that's right we call this
[55:27] eternal in that night but don't you
[55:33] think one of these days brother there
[55:35] with that drawn to be done away with you
[55:37] show me one quote from rudder Brown are
[55:40] the Bible that you're right
[55:48] all the representations that was ever
[55:52] used in the Bible to represent Christ
[55:55] and will be in heaven try to get back
[55:59] yeah my love that's right makes you
[56:05] think
[56:09] you see me brother led across star well
[56:12] why don't you believe the villain an
[56:18] amazing thing to me and I thought it was
[56:20] so wonderful I mean you ever been to
[56:23] biltmore house did you go in the garden
[56:26] and look at all of the trees and the
[56:30] shrubbery anything they got apple trees
[56:36] growing right straight up the wall close
[56:41] to that you know planted closer then
[56:44] that guitar is goes right up the wall
[56:47] you've seen it and the limbs go up and
[56:50] out and go hook right against that wall
[56:57] they designed it that way I stood there
[57:00] let's do nothing oh we get to heaven
[57:04] they'll still be a lot of crops as you
[57:06] right now on the cross was a bad thing
[57:13] do you think the crops from the bad
[57:16] thing it was your ability to go to hell
[57:20] the only way you're gonna get the hell
[57:22] of it by the crops and you think it's a
[57:24] horrible thing the tree of life will be
[57:29] there according to the book of
[57:30] Revelation high 22 he's a 21 or 22 you
[57:34] know and the river of life will be there
[57:35] that why do you want to do away with any
[57:39] form of God
[57:45] when he raised with nail prints in hand
[57:48] do you think when you would get there in
[57:49] the future homies not know how them know
[57:53] maybe that's what you believe anyone
[57:55] only right I believe they're still be a
[58:01] bad way not to have to remind us the big
[58:08] part of his attributes see that's why
[58:11] when when I get started then I'm begin
[58:14] to just roll into the guardian and I
[58:17] can't help it so you know bear with me
[58:19] that that's where I begin to seek my
[58:21] type you know I see everything in him
[58:25] I'm just trying to express it to you and
[58:27] I might try the throne
[58:35] come on come to man a boy was made for
[58:41] it to be delivered to mankind to make it
[58:44] roll into our heart now who's strong is
[58:48] that
[58:55] now Jesus according to revelations but
[58:59] it 321 I've got it in here but that's
[59:02] our they don't have to pull it he said
[59:05] he that overcometh will sit with me and
[59:08] my throne as I've overcome and sit with
[59:12] a father in history right now if you'll
[59:15] notice not a brother I'm uses the word
[59:17] on a long time that's all right I looked
[59:19] at that too but if you'll notice it
[59:22] doesn't say home it says he impact right
[59:26] because you got to make the person
[59:28] enjoyed one right now d everything got
[59:30] to come together no mom is like setting
[59:33] the first known to another person or you
[59:35] know whatever you do alright then when
[59:40] Jesus was here he wasn't on his own pro
[59:50] his strong doesn't come into being until
[59:52] of millennion
[1:00:00] we got a plan here so we get good but
[1:00:05] you see what he was doing was making a
[1:00:07] way for the Father strong to come in to
[1:00:10] be right absolutely amen the Father
[1:00:13] strong is the magic using the right we
[1:00:14] go ahead the new birth Jesus was making
[1:00:19] a way for the Father's throne to come
[1:00:21] into being into reality releasing his
[1:00:25] life to work to come and living you and
[1:00:26] I'm ready father struggling to be and
[1:00:28] run around said it's been the father
[1:00:30] strong down through seven church ages
[1:00:32] right that son of God right that's true
[1:00:39] he said then he'll come back to Son of
[1:00:41] Man amen sidity of me son David that's
[1:00:47] really the promise to Jesus Christ
[1:00:49] because David's son Solomon took over
[1:00:52] the natural but Jesus Christ is to be
[1:00:56] our God in the Millennium era to fulfill
[1:00:59] the promise to David is really the
[1:01:03] promise now where r evenings we got here
[1:01:05] until I want you to think
[1:01:11] trying to dis not read so much deny just
[1:01:14] preach a little about think America now
[1:01:19] this will help for later on down the
[1:01:22] road you know that it takes seven church
[1:01:25] ages neat shades having the baptism of
[1:01:28] the Holy Ghost the new birth to bring
[1:01:32] the Father strong into it's foolish be
[1:01:35] okay that's why can't do all these
[1:01:40] people say that Luther Western him to
[1:01:42] having the right they had the baptism of
[1:01:48] the Holy Ghost for their day after the
[1:01:51] day was justification or sanctification
[1:01:54] the baptism of the Holy Ghost has been
[1:01:56] the same in every event code is the new
[1:01:59] murder now so then it's going to take
[1:02:04] seven Church ages to bring this thrown
[1:02:08] into total being and then when we get
[1:02:12] Barry you don't find it in the
[1:02:14] revelation forward you find the lamb in
[1:02:18] Revelations five right with seven horns
[1:02:21] and seven eyes which are the church ages
[1:02:25] and the messenger yep all right write
[1:02:29] that down bang on it
[1:02:32] but we're talking about here when this
[1:02:35] ad is not complete completely we
[1:02:38] be going so we're still in the forming
[1:02:42] of the Father strong maybe that's not a
[1:02:46] good word I don't know I don't have the
[1:02:48] education forgive me folks you put into
[1:02:50] that work closely now in this age all
[1:02:57] this did we complete you agree alright
[1:03:02] the Father strong is going to become
[1:03:03] completely right you said well it was
[1:03:08] darn about shirt was it with aren't each
[1:03:09] one of them listen you birth see if you
[1:03:12] just took Lutheran West with him I'm
[1:03:13] used to feed him colleges well off the
[1:03:15] earth world would be right and you would
[1:03:19] not have because it is a lamb with seven
[1:03:22] horns and seven eyes it's not a lamp
[1:03:25] with six home one and then you try some
[1:03:28] way to put two eyes on the next we make
[1:03:30] yourself eyes or so right that's not
[1:03:32] what it is they selling horns or 7i you
[1:03:36] take out any Church ain't the lamb is
[1:03:39] not complete so the throne in the hearts
[1:03:43] of mankind of the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:46] Ghost when that is completed finish
[1:03:53] complete the throne be completely you
[1:03:58] can't go to me son of man until he
[1:03:59] finishes that all of the doings will son
[1:04:02] of God r it around said he left some
[1:04:06] work for us to do you need that quote he
[1:04:11] said when he went went away he didn't
[1:04:12] finish all things so you'll have some
[1:04:15] work for you and I to do what are we to
[1:04:18] do bring forth the Father strong then I
[1:04:25] get back and I look at the message in
[1:04:27] the titles and the doings and I think
[1:04:29] about it you know that run around join
[1:04:32] you than exactly how it would do
[1:04:34] the brother round preach the message one
[1:04:37] time and they change the title just a
[1:04:39] little how you look it up and change it
[1:04:40] but original title was raised in Jesus
[1:04:43] from history now they got if you're
[1:04:45] looking it up you'll have to pull you
[1:04:46] under another word or do that raising
[1:04:51] Jesus from history now most of you know
[1:04:56] what I'm fixing to say those you've
[1:04:59] heard it many times you know that even
[1:05:03] though the Holy Ghost was there the new
[1:05:05] birth but you know that man and his
[1:05:09] ideas he dethroned God in the church
[1:05:14] heading that's not a good word to use
[1:05:17] but my best understanding in other words
[1:05:20] they took guard off the throne and made
[1:05:22] a Trinity then they could shift around
[1:05:27] the person's it was up there you don't
[1:05:29] move around in the way of saying they'd
[1:05:32] be thrown you now come on folks just be
[1:05:37] sensible I guess you know all of this
[1:05:42] when you first before you ever come into
[1:05:45] message
[1:05:49] Oh
[1:05:53] no she things about it him but you
[1:05:57] realize our doctrines took God off the
[1:06:01] throne even in our heart to be in full
[1:06:03] control don't tell me you didn't do is
[1:06:12] we all do trying to figure out you first
[1:06:13] come into the message first thing you
[1:06:15] try to figure out the Godhead and off
[1:06:17] and then you come up with the idea of
[1:06:18] trying to figure out who do you pray it
[1:06:20] two to one person one time I heard
[1:06:23] preachers say now we know who to break
[1:06:25] it well I thought that's who was praying
[1:06:27] to all time we just had him off the
[1:06:31] throne would you see when this prophet
[1:06:37] began to preach God was being restored
[1:06:41] to the throne of the revelation of
[1:06:45] understand yet
[1:06:50] he was bringing back the Father strong
[1:06:53] to where the father could sit on his own
[1:06:56] drum amen hi is that enough to cover the
[1:07:02] throne then we'll read a lot okay but
[1:07:06] the one sitting on the throne that's
[1:07:08] what Johnse see first he saw throne and
[1:07:14] there's no telling how long he said bear
[1:07:15] to look earth did I looked at it he's
[1:07:17] just stealing from then he saw one
[1:07:21] sitting on the throne and if not then
[1:07:23] why would he emphasizes my thing who was
[1:07:28] that sitting on the throne it's Almighty
[1:07:33] God in the form of Jesus Christ amen not
[1:07:40] Jesus the flesh he said well it's
[1:07:46] sitting on the throne up there yeah
[1:07:48] that's not the heavy that's right did
[1:07:54] you see church what we've done we've
[1:07:57] taken gone off the throne we put another
[1:08:01] guards on that throne what do you like
[1:08:04] that or not that's that way the round
[1:08:07] says you can call in Jesus Jesus and
[1:08:10] worship the devil now do you need that
[1:08:14] quote did you call in Jesus Jesus would
[1:08:18] be worshipping the devil
[1:08:22] that's right my because it's not
[1:08:23] revealed to you who Jesus Christ is
[1:08:25] you're still going to think he's a
[1:08:27] second person of the Trinity or a third
[1:08:29] or some kind of reform that's where you
[1:08:33] got all these two Lords and river
[1:08:35] Jordans and all that from we got to have
[1:08:37] two or three people running around they
[1:08:39] just can't settle it name well y'all got
[1:08:42] everyone that's what I to say where I'm
[1:08:43] at don't worry you going let's do you
[1:08:45] get that right but you know what when I
[1:08:48] get there I'll love you just as well
[1:08:52] because that's thrown in my heart has
[1:08:55] nothing but love in it right you may not
[1:08:58] be to the capstone of love no but it
[1:09:03] sure does love people and want to happen
[1:09:07] your wack in anything while because I
[1:09:12] believe in scraps right okay but do you
[1:09:14] understand won't say it right if you
[1:09:17] don't understand one God then you're
[1:09:21] going to be trying to make too many
[1:09:23] people sitting on the throne my brother
[1:09:27] dick says now that's the reason you
[1:09:28] can't understand is you you don't get it
[1:09:32] down to where the one God's that's right
[1:09:34] you can't understand the Bible with a
[1:09:37] Trinity you want to work out you go run
[1:09:42] aground some water let's see like the
[1:09:45] first seal here stands around with the
[1:09:48] book into that and diagnose a white
[1:09:49] horse rider was shredded carrots when we
[1:09:51] have like Danny then they go dear lemme
[1:09:53] run always go look at God doing there
[1:09:55] nice new Cupid address shooting love in
[1:09:58] art and run around them believe that
[1:10:01] very good
[1:10:04] until God straightened him out we say
[1:10:08] give me a quote okay he said I used to
[1:10:10] believe that Jesus loved me and God
[1:10:12] hated me until I found out it was a safe
[1:10:14] sane person that's a direct quote you
[1:10:17] wanted me but listen church is God on
[1:10:26] the throne in your heart now let's get
[1:10:31] it right without the bad kids with the
[1:10:34] Holy Ghost you can't understand do you
[1:10:36] agree to remind integrating one we're
[1:10:38] going mad because the baptism of the
[1:10:43] Holy Ghost is the father strong in your
[1:10:45] heart right right Matthew's my Holy
[1:10:51] Ghost his father's throwing in your
[1:10:52] heart the person sitting on the throne
[1:10:56] is the Lord Jesus Christ himself right
[1:10:59] in the form of the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:02] Ghost
[1:11:07] not making us to people but making me a
[1:11:12] child of God that I should have been in
[1:11:13] the beginning I Matt listen to both
[1:11:17] Steven Wilson are they talking about you
[1:11:19] know that work right around my believers
[1:11:21] must go to this come on forward Regency
[1:11:27] we're going around did it when you were
[1:11:28] born a worded spirit brings you back
[1:11:30] like it should have been in the
[1:11:31] beginning he said I just hope that I'm
[1:11:34] pretty sure is this a message there he
[1:11:39] says I just wanted to be born into the
[1:11:43] Spirit of God walking in the light of
[1:11:47] the hour at you and I are living God
[1:11:49] strong is coming back and I ever
[1:11:52] beginning to match from here what's
[1:11:55] there when we match what's there we go
[1:11:58] dark cousin towards us to go but it's
[1:12:02] got on the throne in your life right and
[1:12:05] you say now wait a minute brother Dale
[1:12:08] well let's wait a minute
[1:12:15] now when we were believing a Trinitarian
[1:12:17] doctrine right I said when we were
[1:12:21] bleeding a Trinitarian doctrine life
[1:12:23] that's all of us you know whether you
[1:12:27] like it or not solothurn wesleyan him in
[1:12:33] azusa street Pentecost was Trinitarian
[1:12:35] sure but you know they had the baptism
[1:12:39] of the Holy Ghost amen the new birth but
[1:12:45] in their revelation God was dethroned
[1:12:48] because he was a Trinitarian concept so
[1:12:54] you can have the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:56] Ghost and not have all the words you
[1:13:02] agree i magnified what about me sure so
[1:13:07] you're playing a bad kids when the Holy
[1:13:08] ocean I'm going argument nobody about
[1:13:10] before you ever come into message here's
[1:13:14] Trinitarian and believe in that God had
[1:13:20] three there's like a bunch of grapes and
[1:13:21] we have it all explained enough is that
[1:13:27] true
[1:13:30] but you see then this message starts
[1:13:33] doing away with them God's right and
[1:13:38] when we told to get rid of our God's
[1:13:41] with all these all of them burning the
[1:13:43] miles you realize it's United
[1:13:48] Trinitarian doctrine in our mind and
[1:13:50] those God's was on the throne of our
[1:13:52] mind then God's not the true God this
[1:13:58] message is the only message your ears it
[1:14:00] can bring God back to the trial attorney
[1:14:02] you said well it could be with the book
[1:14:04] of Acts yeah but it's either I'm glad
[1:14:07] you said that way the coast we didn't
[1:14:09] understand the book of Acts and the
[1:14:11] Apostles and their doctrine until right
[1:14:14] the Prophet came back so now okay went
[1:14:19] back we were starting to get him on the
[1:14:21] throne you said brother Dale is he on
[1:14:29] the thrall of your art
[1:14:34] I believe I have the back is long ago
[1:14:38] I'm moving out of that Disney with it
[1:14:41] but is God on the throne the prophet of
[1:14:49] God said it like this he said he Lord of
[1:14:51] your life you remember the message
[1:14:55] called doors and door that's right you
[1:15:01] need to go listen to them he said they
[1:15:04] was doors in her heart that we had the
[1:15:06] door closed to now I do not believe we
[1:15:09] had seen in there like seeing of natural
[1:15:15] filthy garbage but we didn't have him on
[1:15:19] the throne of our hearty
[1:15:27] we had too many husbands right right
[1:15:31] better prom too many husbands cuz we had
[1:15:37] a father son and holy ghost and all that
[1:15:39] man now we drop over to Fargo to the one
[1:15:42] that's were just as bad so don't throw
[1:15:44] stones nobody that's right
[1:15:51] but what about it is he god of your life
[1:15:56] but around said we want him in our lives
[1:15:58] and I quote if you like it he said just
[1:16:02] enough to save us from senior just
[1:16:05] enough to keep us from hell but sin is
[1:16:09] he Lord of our line that's that hey ma
[1:16:12] mattress is the all of there is or is it
[1:16:17] still a lot of things in between I love
[1:16:22] my wife I love my kids I love my
[1:16:24] grandkids and great-grandkids my wife
[1:16:29] will tell you in a hurry that I've got
[1:16:33] one love that I have keep getting on she
[1:16:36] never tried to because she's got the
[1:16:37] same love right all right and by that
[1:16:42] she would never get offended to what I'd
[1:16:43] say about it because she knows who i'm
[1:16:46] talking about my live but she would have
[1:16:51] no way to try to take away the one that
[1:16:53] i have overthrown in my heart I'm
[1:16:56] because he's trying to get on her throne
[1:17:03] then I the way it makes a husband and
[1:17:06] wife one go got son gone the same dolch
[1:17:09] might not understand each other
[1:17:11] correctly yeah okay that's human don't
[1:17:14] we still got two more brains but in the
[1:17:19] finality what is it he is the Lord of
[1:17:25] our life we might love our families but
[1:17:30] we can't love them like we do going
[1:17:32] that's right trick right
[1:17:39] man asked me one time you go to church
[1:17:41] fury city if you come to the comments
[1:17:46] you had to make a choice between your
[1:17:47] wife or your jewelry so which would you
[1:17:51] give up you have any choice that's it
[1:17:55] very simple I don't have to think on it
[1:17:57] let's not give up my children because my
[1:18:01] wife was the ability to get those
[1:18:02] children and i still have even the
[1:18:05] ability to make it right for some lower
[1:18:07] you know through her but I said first
[1:18:11] off she's part of many he said when I
[1:18:14] can't say that these funds the end here
[1:18:19] in the church today right he's honest
[1:18:21] he's holding his children meant more to
[1:18:24] him than his wife did
[1:18:29] but why would you want to be that way my
[1:18:34] children how the same DNA but they are
[1:18:35] not if the one that me and my wife
[1:18:43] then we're not even the one lined
[1:18:45] obvious cuz there's two of us
[1:18:54] nature's one hand
[1:18:58] I wish we could get that down in our
[1:18:59] mind think on it yeah well we don't want
[1:19:02] to talk about Godhead we won't get any
[1:19:04] deep things work I didn't I thought the
[1:19:12] capstone revelation was the last
[1:19:14] revelation you need that mountain church
[1:19:16] in his book the final revelation is the
[1:19:20] capstone revelation of the Godhead to
[1:19:25] realize that you and I are a part of God
[1:19:28] made manifest that sons and daughters
[1:19:35] alrighty understand then the throne come
[1:19:38] on the death in a cup he came on the DEP
[1:19:43] headquarters in 3,000 people run it came
[1:19:47] on a dental dam Pentecost 120 the upper
[1:19:49] room at 120 upper room had to teach at
[1:19:52] 3,000 how to climb up the pyramid that
[1:19:57] was lost down through the ages and they
[1:19:59] never dealt with the fear me and that
[1:20:00] dethrone God the prophet of God started
[1:20:04] back in returning those things and begin
[1:20:06] to preach he got into 62 they started
[1:20:08] talking about statue a perfect night
[1:20:13] bringing God back to the right place on
[1:20:15] his strong
[1:20:17] in our Archon life but just remember we
[1:20:24] start reading

[1:20:33] everything yeah no we're going to go out
[1:20:36] with him in the heaven and be up there
[1:20:40] for about three and a half years well

[1:20:46] slips back we could explain that one
[1:20:49] he's up there with us having a wonderful
[1:20:52] time and he slips back and peers to the
[1:20:54] Jews hey you remember he's gone right
[1:20:57] right but see then we all come back as
[1:21:02] the drive in Revelations 19 so we're not
[1:21:08] in there between 419 right but we

[1:39:30] show what I was preaching then you need
[1:39:33] to go back and listen to what is
[1:39:34] preaching because from the day of
[1:39:36] Pentecost the Father's throne the
[1:39:38] baptism of the holy ghost came into the
[1:39:40] hearts of the sites Jesus Christ had to
[1:39:42] make a way that's a corporal body lays
[1:39:44] on the throne waiting yep finishing up
[1:39:48] you're going to find
[1:39:53] that body in Revelation fire at home the
[1:40:00] room their entrance
[1:40:03] now
[1:40:06] would you see he come into our hearts to
[1:40:08] make way no more than he could come down
[1:40:14] and die even and then just take us to
[1:40:16] the Millennium but how would you birth
[1:40:21] and neither can he just come down here
[1:40:24] in this age and just finish it up and
[1:40:25] just take us all to the Millennium
[1:40:27] there's got to be a way so when that
[1:40:32] prophet came out there in the early
[1:40:33] ministry and begin to talk about the son
[1:40:36] of money he said that same son of man is
[1:40:42] here today he said had to prove it that
