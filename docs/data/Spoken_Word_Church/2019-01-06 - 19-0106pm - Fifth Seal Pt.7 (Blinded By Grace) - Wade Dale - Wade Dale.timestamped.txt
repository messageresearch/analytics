[11:22] afternoon pull on the word I tell you

[11:30] with the Lord but I tell you that word
[11:31] is opening and this is I'm looking
[11:34] forward in this year with great
[11:36] expectations more of the word opening
[11:38] this is the time this is a season and we
[11:41] are the people for this time amen open
[11:45] the eyes my heart

[12:36] [Music]
[12:57] [Applause]
[13:05] [Music]
[13:22] holy holy holy holy holy
[13:33] I am I hope he didn't come to see a
[13:47] human today hope you come to see God
[13:49] Almighty in human flesh a man good to be
[13:53] in the house of the Lord
[13:54] good to see each and every one of you
[13:56] happy new year to all of you had a we
[14:03] probably had the biggest group what's
[14:04] not group we'd ever had a lot of you
[14:06] weren't here so you'd all come we'd had
[14:09] a full house but we had pretty much full
[14:11] house and had a good time had a good
[14:13] time brother Chris did a real good job
[14:15] he said tell everybody hey he's he's
[14:17] traveling back tomorrow I think or maybe
[14:20] it was yesterday I can't remember but he
[14:23] said to tell you again god bless you
[14:26] love you with a lovely Lord let me read
[14:28] something real quick that we got on the
[14:30] Internet
[14:31] I believe it's sometimes we think we're
[14:36] walking through the valley of dry bones
[14:38] and sometimes we have a real narrow
[14:41] perspective of what's going on but as
[14:44] brother Joe told us for those of you
[14:46] that weren't here on walks night service
[14:49] brother Joe kind of gave us a overview
[14:52] of the views of the internet which was
[14:56] up into the hundreds of thousands of
[14:57] time and all that hours and all our
[15:01] thousands of hours of time and and I
[15:04] believe he said we reached every country
[15:06] now every country in the world has
[15:09] clicked on our internet sites so we had
[15:13] missed one or two the last time but now
[15:15] I think we've we've covered them all but
[15:17] listen to this it says brother Dale I
[15:19] just want to say that your series on the
[15:21] baptism with the Holy Ghost is probably
[15:22] the best I've ever heard I believe it
[15:25] behooves us as Christians to examine
[15:27] ourselves and our experience with the
[15:28] Word of God to make sure we have what we
[15:31] claim we have I have for some time now
[15:34] struggled to dovetail all the details of
[15:36] justification sanctification in the
[15:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the things
[15:40] of sensations and such I studied
[15:43] intently on the subject through brother
[15:45] Browns teachings and I knew
[15:46] baptism was not the shouting in the
[15:48] tongues but was the Word of God coming
[15:50] alive in you it's a revelation and mine
[15:53] was Romans chapter 8 concerning the love
[15:56] of God in Christ Jesus that revelation
[15:58] changed me and I was never the same
[16:00] again
[16:01] I knew that's where I met my Lord that
[16:05] was there was no sensation just a
[16:07] revelation I didn't even really
[16:08] understand entirely what happened that
[16:10] night
[16:10] just that I was his and he was mine but
[16:13] Satan Ward was on my mind on sensations
[16:15] and such and after seeking God for
[16:17] answers I can say he has used your
[16:19] sermons to confirm me and reveal himself
[16:21] in me all over again thank you brother
[16:24] for the wonderful teaching I've been
[16:26] wonderfully blessed and I praise God for
[16:28] the operation of the Holy Ghost through
[16:29] you brother
[16:30] blank blank revealed Word Tabernacle so
[16:34] we just got that today so some people
[16:41] don't sleep through the sermon some
[16:45] people will you let's turn to revelation
[16:49] 6 we're gonna get started today we at
[16:52] the end of the at the end of the service
[16:55] we need to number one we prayed over a
[16:58] few prayer cloths to send to Mary and
[17:00] Micah but we've got some more we want to
[17:03] pray over and y'all can send them to
[17:05] Cathy right you have their new address
[17:08] okay we're gonna give you the she
[17:11] requested us to give pray over them so
[17:14] they can take them to their new home
[17:15] over in Japan so so we're gonna pray
[17:18] over a few more that's probably not
[17:20] enough to hang over the doors and put in
[17:21] cars and all that so we're gonna pray
[17:24] over a few more into the service all of
[17:25] us are gonna pray and we'll send the
[17:28] other ones I'll give them to y'all and
[17:29] y'all can send them okay just pray for
[17:31] Mary and pray for me and Michael that's
[17:33] a commendable thing to do if you're
[17:34] going overseas to another country need
[17:37] all the help you can get and there's one
[17:40] thing about our Lord he's never out of
[17:43] Wi-Fi range he doesn't need a tower
[17:45] he doesn't need a he doesn't need a
[17:47] satellite or a cell phone
[17:49] he's ever-present and he'll be right
[17:51] there with him in Japan so Lord bless
[17:54] you reminded me though I'm gonna leave
[17:55] these right here so if I don't just
[17:57] remind me revelation 6 today we're going
[17:59] to still can
[18:00] on the fifth seal part seven and I want
[18:04] to title this one blinded by grace think
[18:08] of that blinded by grace all right
[18:12] because it was grace that was extended
[18:15] to these fifth seal Jews and grace is
[18:21] unmerited favor nothing they did but it
[18:25] was done by God himself because of an
[18:28] act of grace and actually grace is what
[18:32] blinded him your grace the grace he went
[18:38] and came and got a Gentile bride that
[18:41] grace is what blinded him the grace to
[18:44] you where the the headstone cross grace
[18:46] grace unto it that's you and I you and I
[18:51] the grace that God extended to us
[18:53] blinded his own children and therefore
[18:56] being a just God he gives them eternal
[18:59] life man so let's just bow our heads
[19:02] Heavenly Father thank you for this day
[19:04] that we have this time that we've come
[19:07] to reflect on the word Lord as brother
[19:11] Dale has been preaching that's not
[19:12] letters on a page because all that will
[19:15] pass away but Lord the word manifested
[19:18] in a heart as this brother just sent us
[19:20] the email there that's the Living Word
[19:23] of God made manifest in a human being
[19:27] Lord I pray that you'd be with each one
[19:29] here in the sanctuary Lord be with the
[19:32] ones that are sick ones that couldn't be
[19:34] with us Lord we pray that you would just
[19:37] be the active participant in the service
[19:39] you do the speaking you do the hearing
[19:41] and only you can do the revealing father
[19:44] just let it not be a meeting of minds
[19:46] Lord let the word sink deep in our heart
[19:48] and show us what day and time we're
[19:50] living in and show us our position so
[19:53] that we can become better Christians
[19:54] Lord forgive us of our sins
[19:57] let's brother Lewis and Emmett on the
[19:59] way back get him back here safe Lord
[20:01] with his family Lord just bless us now
[20:04] and be with the other missionaries on
[20:05] the foreign fields Lord brother Knoll
[20:08] Johnson comes to mind Lord he is his
[20:10] wife's having some trouble with her
[20:13] heart so he
[20:14] not gonna get to go to India as long as
[20:16] he wanted to Lord I pray that you would
[20:17] just give him fruit for his labor Lord
[20:20] he Labor's every year over there Lord
[20:21] and we pray that you're just touching me
[20:23] just bless us now in the firm of this
[20:25] service in Jesus name we pray amen and
[20:29] when he had opened the fifth seal I saw
[20:31] under the altar the souls of them but
[20:32] were slain for the word of God and for
[20:35] the testimony which they held and they
[20:36] cried with a loud voice saying how long
[20:38] O Lord holy and true dost thou not judge
[20:41] and avenge our blood on them that dwell
[20:42] on the earth and white robes were given
[20:45] and every one of them and it was said
[20:46] unto them that they should rest yet for
[20:48] a little season until their
[20:49] fellow-servants also and their brethren
[20:51] that should be killed as they were
[20:53] should be fulfilled you may be seated
[20:56] the Lord that is a blessing to the
[20:57] reading of the word man so now we've
[20:59] been talking a little on the fifth seal
[21:00] here this is number seven and we know
[21:03] one thing's for sure we're not going to
[21:05] bring this chart out but we know that
[21:07] we've come to the fifth seal and this
[21:10] fifth seal each seal to me I was
[21:13] thinking the other day that each seal
[21:16] sure it has the the seal meaning has the
[21:19] seal that we were talking about had two
[21:21] seal on it where the first seal was the
[21:24] wild horse rider was the Antichrist and
[21:26] the things he done but then when that
[21:28] book opened we saw the Thunder
[21:31] underneath that seal that spoke of our
[21:33] Redemption all right so the redemption
[21:35] of our whole being comes under that seal
[21:40] we're talking about the your human body
[21:44] and then your human body a man is to be
[21:48] redeemed and potentially it's already
[21:50] redeemed it was redeemed at Calvary amen
[21:54] and you we just got to come to a
[21:56] realization of that because Satan has
[21:58] worked through that memories and
[22:00] conscious affection and imagination to
[22:02] tell us that that's not true okay well
[22:06] Christ is in the soul he is the soul
[22:08] he's trying to tell us that he's already
[22:10] done it
[22:11] so there's your war there's your you
[22:14] know you you brother Brian made the
[22:16] illustration of white dog black dog and
[22:18] I've heard people preaching the message
[22:19] that that was in your soul that's not in
[22:21] your soul you're either black dog or
[22:24] white dog in your soul
[22:25] but what happens is when the white dog
[22:28] enters the soul the black dog tries to
[22:31] come back in so it moves out to that
[22:34] next room which is the spirit realm and
[22:36] there's your black dog white dog fight
[22:38] because listen there's no if you're born
[22:40] again today there's no fight in your
[22:42] soul Jesus said come to me all that
[22:45] labor and heavy laden and I'll give you
[22:48] rest
[22:49] it's not the day of Sunday we come to
[22:52] rest no we fight and work on Sunday for
[22:54] Christians like we do and you know most
[22:56] people in the world they rest on Sunday
[22:58] well we don't rest on Sunday
[23:00] no we fight and then we fight all seven
[23:04] days a week but Sunday we have to fight
[23:05] because we come into one group and we
[23:08] have to fight the devil to get here we
[23:09] have to fight the devil while we're here
[23:11] we have to fight him when we leave amen
[23:13] so that's already that okay but our soul
[23:16] is at rest your soul is not in a fight
[23:20] it's God it's that next realm that's got
[23:25] to be worked on the memories and
[23:26] conservation imagination that's what we
[23:28] got to work on that room and I believe
[23:30] that's where the seals work on that room
[23:32] shows us that we're already justified as
[23:36] we said before seal one being
[23:38] justification as though you never did it
[23:41] seal number two the Red Horse Reds
[23:44] always sanctification the sanctification
[23:47] of your spirit realm which is the statue
[23:50] of a perfect man because remember think
[23:54] of this that's think of this last night
[23:57] we were talking in the Bible study can I
[24:00] make a point here Kenneth do you mind
[24:04] I'm going to anyway listen if you hold
[24:10] an office in this church you should be
[24:12] at Bible study every that's only 12
[24:15] Saturdays a year if you hold an office
[24:19] in this church you should be a church
[24:21] every service because people are
[24:27] watching you and some of you hold
[24:29] offices and you don't come to Bible
[24:31] studying you know why you shouldn't be
[24:34] an officer amen
[24:37] she's not being officer thank you
[24:39] brother dating a man he's that shouldn't
[24:41] be an officer all right look this these
[24:47] characteristics emanate from your soul
[24:52] right because you're not looking at the
[24:57] knowledge of man you're looking at the
[24:59] knowledge of God that comes from your
[25:02] soul that's what we were talking about
[25:04] last night
[25:05] these emanate these are the what stature
[25:07] of this man right here and he is where
[25:11] he's in your soul if you're born again
[25:14] so he's he is these virtues are
[25:17] emanating from the soul outward to get
[25:20] into the spirit realm you just gotta let
[25:25] it out and work on this and let it out
[25:28] let it out let it keep working out and
[25:30] then it's just going to change this guy
[25:32] it's just going to change it I mean
[25:35] we've already come to a temporary change
[25:37] you don't do the things you used to do
[25:38] do you hang you don't do the things you
[25:41] used to do the things I used to do I'd
[25:44] do them no more
[25:46] hey man okay so if you did not go to
[25:50] church you're the okay I've always
[26:02] said hey Jim you don't need to wash this
[26:06] best anymore I've always said the people
[26:11] that come to Bible study really are the
[26:13] ones that don't need it the ones that
[26:15] don't come as one to need it one more
[26:19] time yeah think about it anyway well you
[26:25] know what Bible study always talked
[26:27] about God we're gonna talk about I feel
[26:34] left out I guess I mean you know there's
[26:35] sometimes you can't come I know that you
[26:37] know that to this but man there's 52
[26:40] Sundays in a year you ought to be able
[26:43] to make about 50 em I mean everybody
[26:46] takes a two-week vacation right
[26:51] but some of you come twice and take a
[26:53] pizza 250 we play case so anyway no if
[26:57] you want to be spiritually fed you got
[26:59] to go you got to get where you the
[27:00] food's out right
[27:02] why can't okay I can't I can't I thought
[27:06] I can't yeah cuz you know what this
[27:12] bride we was thinking about this a
[27:14] little bit last night this bride is an
[27:15] overcoming bride we're not just bride
[27:18] then you just lay back no you'll fight
[27:23] your way all the way through and man
[27:25] this is not a picnic clear your schedule
[27:30] for God and I'll promise you he'll make
[27:31] time for you hey man all right so now we
[27:36] come to the black horse the black horse
[27:40] we see the new birth which is coming to
[27:42] adoption in the Statue of a perfect man
[27:43] we know we get the spirit of adoption
[27:45] when we're born again but we are come -
[27:48] we are coming to a place of adoption
[27:51] amen
[27:52] I'm still number 4 as all those wrapped
[27:56] up together which is the word made flesh
[27:59] are the body change cause remember on
[28:02] the fourth seal we took a rapture so
[28:04] there has to be a body change somewhere
[28:06] in there amen because we're leaving now
[28:09] that's you just got to see that that
[28:11] when we leave this earth where's the
[28:14] bride of Jesus Christ have already come
[28:16] to full adoption we've all come to full
[28:20] revelation of a body change
[28:23] amen not another body see that's the
[28:25] lazy people that don't come to church no
[28:29] I've got a fight to keep this thing
[28:30] under control you and I have got to
[28:32] fight to keep this thing under control
[28:35] and the bride's caught up on the for
[28:41] sale so now we've been talking about the
[28:43] fifth seal which is the higher form of
[28:47] justification that you realize that the
[28:50] real you never did it doesn't matter
[28:53] what you what your mind says and we were
[28:56] talking last night don't don't get this
[28:59] to where they so much send this
[29:01] perfection that we're going
[29:03] come to a place to where you know we
[29:05] don't have a bad thought
[29:07] please brother Brown said this thing's
[29:10] gonna be sticky all the way to the
[29:12] change so that's what I said it's a
[29:14] fight all the way to the change hey man
[29:18] so you must fight to know the real you
[29:20] never did it and to know the real you
[29:22] never did it is to see yourself in the
[29:24] word that that Genesis 1:26 man is that
[29:28] person residing in you today and that
[29:31] man never did it
[29:32] amen and you will only see it we were
[29:36] talking yesterday now last night in the
[29:39] Bible study this is full revelation
[29:42] folks we've got the full we we are in a
[29:47] buffet debt debt that Golden Corral
[29:52] rinds
[29:54] anybody hungry yet and and the Chinese
[29:58] buffet that you can get anything if your
[30:00] heart's desire this is we're past that
[30:03] during the ages they had certain places
[30:06] they could go to some got McDonald's
[30:08] some got a steak but you and I all we
[30:12] gotta do is walk in and say I want this
[30:14] and God will already have it there for
[30:16] you because you and I now have the rebel
[30:18] a even see Paul like catch what brother
[30:21] Dale was talking about when John is
[30:23] riding on the Isle of Patmos the second
[30:27] now he's in the first church age but the
[30:29] seconds never come the thirds never come
[30:31] for man he's just in the very beginning
[30:33] of Christianity but he's telling us what
[30:37] was going to happen to us 2,000 years
[30:39] and past another thousand for the
[30:43] millennium and then going into the
[30:44] future home he's telling us the whole
[30:46] thing and remember it was only compiled
[30:51] in a book about Luther's time to where
[30:56] we can say we have a Bible and we can
[30:57] read Genesis through revelation so a lot
[31:00] of it had to be that you believe what
[31:03] the preacher said but now you should
[31:07] believe what a good gospel preacher says
[31:09] but you still should check it out you've
[31:11] got plenty of resources you know I was
[31:13] looking about the Holocaust
[31:15] we're gonna talk about that because
[31:16] that's what comes into the fifth seal
[31:18] just put in Holocaust and the computer
[31:20] you can read for two hours about what
[31:22] happened to the Jews because listen
[31:24] that's what I was saying before John saw
[31:28] a fifth seal Jew you and I have that
[31:31] history available to us he did not he
[31:35] didn't I don't believe John when he
[31:37] wrote the fifth seal he wrote what he
[31:38] saw I don't believe he said now this is
[31:41] going to be the Holocaust Jews and
[31:43] there's six million I'm gonna be killed
[31:45] by a man named Eichmann and Hitler and
[31:47] but we do we have that in our disposal
[31:51] and for those of you to think it don't
[31:54] happen
[31:54] you're contrary to the Bible the Bible
[31:58] says it happened so I don't need
[32:00] somebody to tell me that the Holocaust
[32:01] didn't happen now please that's just
[32:04] pitiful it happened because the word
[32:06] said it happened a prophet of God said
[32:09] it happened
[32:09] Amen so I don't have to have anybody
[32:11] else's opinion that it didn't happen
[32:15] right so now we are now under the fifth
[32:19] seal we're going to see like I said
[32:23] before blinded by grace a group had to
[32:27] be blinded so that you and I could come
[32:29] in because if not he would have come to
[32:32] them they would have accepted it and we
[32:35] would have not been included because
[32:36] according to the Old Testament you and I
[32:39] might have a little bit of chance to get
[32:41] in a little piece but not the fullness
[32:43] that we see now amen
[32:46] or you can see where we talked about the
[32:48] the Gentiles being grafted in but now
[32:51] the Gentiles were grafted in the true
[32:53] grafting was after Jesus had died and
[32:57] the Jews had put him on the cross but
[33:00] now you got to remember I'm the one that
[33:03] put him on the cross but physically the
[33:07] Jews 2000 years ago they said let his
[33:09] blood be on us and our children turn
[33:12] rejected that Mossad that came to them
[33:15] he came to his own and his own received
[33:17] him not
[33:18] amen but you and I are recipients of God
[33:22] blind in the eyes of the of the Jews and
[33:25] so that you and I could be the wild
[33:27] olive branch could be graft
[33:29] and then as we said before it's not just
[33:32] the branch because the branch lives off
[33:35] the life and the life is totally that
[33:39] old part of the Jewish tradition the old
[33:42] part of the Jewish life it's what the
[33:44] Prophet said he killed the life he just
[33:47] took an olive branch off of another tree
[33:49] and grafted it right in lived off the
[33:51] life you and I live off the life of the
[33:54] Old Testament you know why because
[33:56] brother branham said Jesus's body was
[33:58] what formed by the Old Testament
[34:02] prophets if you can't see Christ in
[34:05] every verse read it again now that goes
[34:08] back to like brother Tom used to say
[34:11] them old war stories got a little
[34:13] mundane or you know this one begot this
[34:16] one and that one killed this one but it
[34:18] all is in type coming down showing Jesus
[34:20] Christ good prophets it if you can't see
[34:22] Christ in every verse then you need to
[34:25] read it again alright so now we're in
[34:27] the fifth seal everybody okay alright so
[34:32] now let's read the first one let's just
[34:34] read these quotes real quick to just
[34:36] catch everybody back up
[34:40] number one Oh Lamb of God come forward
[34:43] we pray we're calling you Lord the great
[34:45] Redeemer come forth and show us your
[34:47] plan of redemption now he's on the fifth
[34:50] seal and he's still talking about the
[34:52] plan of redemption because literally the
[34:56] fifth seal Jew is considered in the plan
[34:58] of redemption but you and I get the
[35:00] spiritual part because remember in
[35:02] Revelations for one we're caught up not
[35:06] seen until revelations 19 none of that
[35:09] is to us in the literal part revelations
[35:13] 10 brother
[35:14] well revelations 10 is does but it's
[35:18] also to Israel hey man they have to live
[35:22] the book amen in the days of the voice
[35:26] you know I like that because when
[35:29] brother Dale said dad I thought well
[35:30] I've never seen it that way it doesn't
[35:32] say in the days of the written word it
[35:37] says in the days of the boys now you
[35:39] know what I do I'm like
[35:42] on Patmos I'm standing and I'm looking
[35:44] and a voice says I am Alpha and Omega
[35:49] the beginning in the end and I hear the
[35:54] voice I turn to see William Branham
[35:58] because we know that no women I hear the
[36:01] voice of that seventh angel prophet but
[36:05] when I turn I see the Son of Man I do
[36:09] just like John I turn I see the bride so
[36:13] when I listen to a tape I don't see
[36:15] William Branham I've never seen him
[36:17] before physically some of you have but I
[36:22] have never seen him you know wow yeah we
[36:23] saw him in 1950 on the movie but that's
[36:26] not in person but I know his voice and
[36:30] like John on Patmos I turned to see the
[36:32] voice well when I put a tape on I don't
[36:34] see William Brennan I see a voice
[36:37] talking to me talking to a bride and I
[36:41] see that he has brought us a word to the
[36:43] bride to make a bride for this seven
[36:46] church aged about you know I read the
[36:48] other day brother Branham said the angel
[36:50] said what you'll be gathered with your
[36:52] people
[36:52] he said old branham's he's they said no
[36:54] your converse the people that are
[36:57] converted under your message or under
[36:59] your ministry that's what we're sitting
[37:01] under now we're sitting under where John
[37:04] gets the book and he eats the book in
[37:06] Revelations 10 8 that book has has John
[37:11] didn't take the book and start walking
[37:12] into the different countries you don't
[37:15] see the book no more John becomes the
[37:19] book or the book becomes John because
[37:22] when he eats the book the book
[37:23] disappears that's the same thing with
[37:26] you and I but as long as we got in sure
[37:28] we like to read quote but if that quote
[37:31] doesn't come alive I make it say a whole
[37:33] lot of different things like this
[37:37] morning you want to know it here's an
[37:38] example in Sunday School class this
[37:40] morning we were reading in Romans and
[37:45] Paul was talking about kind of like the
[37:47] nine spiritual gifts in other words he
[37:49] was giving us a list of things and Aaron
[37:51] read them off for us but you know what
[37:53] I've done when I read a couple of those
[37:54] passages of Scripture
[37:55] mind immediately went to robert Tatum
[38:00] the characteristic Robert Tatum had was
[38:03] in that in that sentence in that
[38:06] scripture and some of you agree because
[38:08] we know brother Tatum beautiful I can't
[38:10] read it it wasn't part of what I was
[38:11] gonna talk about but the same thing but
[38:14] so did that words stay on the page it
[38:17] became alive because Robert a double
[38:21] live that Tatum live that's that
[38:24] scripture so when I see that scripture I
[38:27] see a person who used to sit right here
[38:28] I see that person that's what you got to
[38:31] see you guys see yourself in the word
[38:34] but when you're reading the word you see
[38:36] others because it brings to your memory
[38:39] how that there's one word brother that's
[38:41] the brother Dale was long-suffering
[38:46] everybody shake your head yeah he's
[38:49] long-suffering he'd fight sometimes only
[38:51] one time a long time ago so how do you
[38:52] put up with these people I'll not tell
[38:58] you what he said but that was my
[39:00] question but you know what is he had
[39:02] patience that's why amen
[39:05] that's why that patience right there
[39:07] kind of higher up close to the statute
[39:09] to the top of the pyramid is to have
[39:12] patience brother Brown said have
[39:13] patience with God but he also said have
[39:15] patience with the people
[39:16] so he's long-suffering and so is God
[39:18] he's long-suffering we'll me and you
[39:20] amen so now let's read the second one so
[39:23] we're still talking about breaking the
[39:25] fifth seal shows us the plan of
[39:28] redemption which to me it shows us grace
[39:32] grace amazing grace
[39:34] and then now let's go to number two the
[39:37] fifth seal now notice and not first
[39:39] souls under the altar now here's one we
[39:41] get some agreement but just watch from
[39:44] it I thought that too but it didn't come
[39:46] that way I've always thought that these
[39:47] souls under the altar with the martyrs
[39:49] of the early church now listen hold that
[39:51] word martyrs cuz we got to talk about
[39:52] that in a little bit because remember
[39:54] the fifth seal Jew is not a it's not a
[39:57] Jew that just died a natural death
[40:03] I'll read you where brother Brown says
[40:05] it's the mark there under the martyrs
[40:07] altar and a martyr is someone that
[40:09] is killed for a purpose okay so it's not
[40:14] every Jew and my question is I'm gonna
[40:17] ask you this question there was a lot of
[40:19] Jews that survived the Holocaust and
[40:23] they died a natural death well they fit
[40:26] filled you because brother Bram says
[40:30] they got to be martyred they got to be
[40:31] killed for that purpose mmm maybe they
[40:35] weren't predestinated maybe they weren't
[40:38] part of God's plan because I'm gonna
[40:40] tell you brother Brown says only those
[40:42] that are predestinated Jews as the ones
[40:44] he's gonna save so that's my question
[40:46] there were something that now that was
[40:48] something survived that could tell us
[40:49] what went on right so they had to
[40:52] survive there was about a hundred out of
[40:54] that article I'm going to read you in a
[40:56] few minutes they were killing fourteen
[40:58] thousand Jews a day imagine a slaughter
[41:02] of fourteen thousand people a day for
[41:07] twenty something days straight don't
[41:12] tell me it's not real the martyrs he
[41:14] thought this was the martyrs of the
[41:16] other church I thought so myself but
[41:18] when the Holy Spirit showed division it
[41:19] isn't the salt so none of this fifth
[41:22] seal look none of this fifth seal is
[41:23] talking about a Christian martyr a
[41:27] Christian person it's not talking about
[41:30] anybody with the new birth the fifth
[41:33] seal Jew is a group of people that's
[41:35] given white robes after they've died a
[41:40] martyr's death there by okay that that's
[41:44] that's and that's the specific because
[41:46] remember now look Gentiles were saved as
[41:50] numbers we don't know what that number
[41:52] is but there's gonna be just 144,000
[41:56] saved 12,000 out of each tribe and
[41:57] there's only gonna be a fifth seal Jew
[41:59] that's included in the martyr but 20
[42:02] martyrdom between brother Branham I'll
[42:04] read it a little while to the cross and
[42:05] right now okay okay so there's a
[42:10] specific group because he deals with the
[42:13] Jews as a nation Jews Israel you and I
[42:17] are whatever doesn't matter where we're
[42:20] Caucasian so we're everything so these
[42:22] are not the
[42:23] souls of the broadchurch so forget about
[42:25] the fifth seal Jew let's make it plain
[42:30] if it was that it would be real simple
[42:34] cuz I accepted eternal life here I get
[42:37] my robe then I go getting another in
[42:38] another dimension when I pass away but
[42:42] what about a group of people that live
[42:44] their whole life not caring to hear
[42:50] about Jesus Christ because he wasn't
[42:52] them aside to them but I'm a Jew I'm
[42:55] God's chosen so I am going to live that
[43:00] life doesn't matter if Germany comes or
[43:04] whoever comes Poland or whoever comes
[43:06] and says we're going to kill you for
[43:08] being a Jew well I'm sorry I can't help
[43:10] it I'm a Jew so boom they take them and
[43:13] put them in a gas chamber that person is
[43:16] going to get eternal life for being who
[43:18] they are not the testimony of Jesus
[43:21] Christ but the testimony they held
[43:23] that's what the Bible says alright so
[43:26] there's not the souls of the bride
[43:27] Church to me that's the easy part
[43:30] you get eternal life here you go in the
[43:33] sixth dimension but you take the fifth
[43:35] seal Jew it's just a Jew that doesn't
[43:40] get a white robe here they don't live a
[43:42] Christian life here they can be smokers
[43:43] and drinkers and all those things but
[43:47] they gave their life for being a Jew and
[43:50] they're put in a place and they're in a
[43:54] holding place waiting for the something
[43:57] else to happen alright and then they're
[44:01] given white robes because of what God
[44:04] did blinding their eyes we'll read in
[44:08] just a minute brother Ram nails it
[44:09] of course he nails it all the time but I
[44:11] found a good a quote where he really
[44:13] really narrows it down so now look so
[44:17] the fifth seal I don't need to read the
[44:18] rest of that quote the fifth seal fifth
[44:20] tells you is not a Christian Jew all
[44:25] right so it's not somebody that give
[44:26] their life for the gospel or for the
[44:29] testimony of Jesus Christ no it says for
[44:33] the word of God what they were in the
[44:34] Word of God and the testimony that they
[44:36] hell
[44:37] all right so let's go to the seal the
[44:38] seal says when he had opened the fifth
[44:40] seal I saw under the altar the souls of
[44:42] them that were slain for the word of God
[44:44] and for the testimony can we change that
[44:49] please
[45:02] to the seal the seal revelation 6 verse
[45:05] 9 through 11 no the other way no the
[45:10] other way no there you go and we had
[45:18] opened the fifth seal I saw under the
[45:20] altar the souls of them were slain for
[45:22] the word of God and for the testimony
[45:23] which they held they held on they didn't
[45:27] try to hide they were Jews and they cry
[45:31] with the loud voice saying how long O
[45:33] Lord holy and true dost thou not judge
[45:34] and avenge our blood on them that dwell
[45:36] on the earth now they've got enough
[45:38] consciousness to know that something
[45:41] happened to them while they were alive
[45:43] and they were put in this place for a
[45:45] purpose because they look to this side
[45:47] and they look to that side and it's
[45:49] their people that they died in the death
[45:51] camps with in places like that okay and
[45:54] they cried with a loud voice saying how
[45:55] long and white robes were given unto
[45:57] every one of them and it was said unto
[45:59] them that they should rest yet for a
[46:01] little season in other words in other
[46:03] words what you know what I would say is
[46:05] hold on a minute
[46:06] you know how a Jew is they're pretty
[46:10] high strung cuz that's what they're
[46:12] saying they said with a loud voice they
[46:15] cried with a loud voice how long the
[46:17] Lord so he said rest for a little season
[46:19] until your fellow servants and their
[46:21] brethren that should be killed as they
[46:22] were should be fulfilled
[46:24] so we now these were souls under now I
[46:26] want to add a word here because brother
[46:28] Branham adds the word later on these are
[46:30] under the martyrs altar Christians are
[46:34] not under martyr altar they're under the
[46:38] altar of God the sixth dimension they're
[46:40] under there in that six dimensions we're
[46:42] perfect love we're the new birth you
[46:45] have the new birth here that's what
[46:46] takes you when you pass the way it takes
[46:48] you into that sixth dimension thereby
[46:49] okay with that but the martyrs altar now
[46:52] sure there was 68 million Christians
[46:55] killed they were martyred
[46:56] but they just went in the sixth
[46:57] dimension okay they're in the sixth
[47:00] dimension with Columbus group amen with
[47:04] their gathered with their group and
[47:05] they're waiting dimension inside of a
[47:07] dimension and then that okay cuz brother
[47:11] Brown didn't see Paul he didn't see
[47:12] Iranian see Martin
[47:14] the angel said you'll gathered with your
[47:17] people so they're standing at dimension
[47:20] inside of six dimension that's probably
[47:22] seven dimensions
[47:23] you got Paul's group over here you got
[47:26] Arrhenius because you're gathered with
[47:27] your age and they're gathered what they
[47:31] gather for the Word of God why they're
[47:33] Jews the testimony they held and then
[47:37] judge and avenge our blood so they've
[47:39] got an attitude a little bit because
[47:42] brother Brown said a Christian wouldn't
[47:43] do that a Christian would say forgive
[47:46] them Lord but these people are not
[47:47] saying they're not very forgiving judge
[47:50] and avenge our blood right so white
[47:53] robes are given because of what God did
[47:55] he gave them white robes and they got a
[47:59] rest for a little season what 2,000
[48:01] years during that 2,000 years they got a
[48:03] rest for a little while until their
[48:05] fellow-servants and brethren are killed
[48:06] which will be as brother Brennan will
[48:08] tell us in a minute the 144,000 that's
[48:11] killed when we leave we were talking
[48:13] about that last week on on the seventy
[48:15] weeks of Daniel so now let's go to the
[48:19] transgression just keep going up
[48:28] no signal
[48:37] all right let's read the transgression
[48:38] remember words in Jeremiah there we go
[48:41] all right the Lord said unto me in the
[48:42] days of Josiah of the king I stop seeing
[48:45] that which black back siding black
[48:48] backsliding Israel hath done she has
[48:50] gone upon every high mountain and
[48:51] evergreen tree and played the harlot
[48:53] let's just read the red part whereby
[48:55] backsliding Israel committed adultery I
[48:57] had put her away and giving her a bill
[48:59] of divorcement yet her treacherous
[49:01] sister Judah feared not but went and
[49:02] played the harlot also so anyway God put
[49:05] them away I put them give him a billing
[49:08] of divorcement and put him away and they
[49:12] are not to be his wife anymore
[49:16] they're to be servants because he's
[49:19] fixing to take a new wife a Gentile
[49:23] bride amen let's roll it up and read the
[49:26] red part down there says then save earth
[49:28] to go proclaim these words say go return
[49:30] thou backsliding Israel saith the Lord
[49:32] and I what God caused my anger to fall
[49:34] upon you for I am merciful saith the
[49:36] Lord
[49:37] graceful saith the Lord and I will not
[49:41] keep anger forever only acknowledged on
[49:43] iniquity that thou has transgressed
[49:45] against the LORD thy God and has
[49:47] scattered those to the strangers under
[49:49] every Green Tree and you have not obeyed
[49:51] my voice that the Lord turn old
[49:53] backsliding children stay at the Lord
[49:55] for I am married unto you and I will
[49:57] take you one of a city and two of a
[49:59] family and I will bring you to Zion
[50:03] Jeremiah 31 behold the days come saith
[50:06] the Lord that I will make a new covenant
[50:08] with the house of Israel and with the
[50:10] house of Jacob not according to the
[50:12] Covenant that I made with their fathers
[50:14] and the day that I took them by the hand
[50:16] to bring them out of the land of Egypt
[50:18] which my covenant they break although I
[50:22] was a husband unto them saith the Lord
[50:24] but this shall be the Covenant that I
[50:27] will make with the house of Israel after
[50:28] those days saith the Lord I will put my
[50:31] law in their inward parts and write it
[50:34] in their hearts and will be their God
[50:38] and they shall be my people and they
[50:41] shall teach no more every man his
[50:42] neighbor and every man his brother
[50:43] saying know the Lord for they all all
[50:46] know him for they shall know me from the
[50:48] least of them to the greatest answer
[50:50] Lord for
[50:50] we'll forgive their iniquity and I will
[50:53] remember their sin no more
[50:55] that fifth seal Jew in God's eyes has no
[50:58] sin he can't give them eternal life and
[51:01] see their sin blinded by grace i
[51:09] interject myself here for a minute
[51:12] God is blinded by grief he don't see
[51:17] your sin does he he and see your sin
[51:20] does he what blinded him the grace that
[51:23] he gave to you Oh think about that that
[51:29] was fresh I didn't have that mono all
[51:32] right let's go the next one
[51:34] Romans 11 well now then the branch was
[51:37] broken off that I might be grafted in no
[51:39] we we talked about that last last Sunday
[51:42] because of unbelief they were broken off
[51:44] so when Christ died on the cross their
[51:49] unbelief broke them off from anything to
[51:52] go to God amen when they said let his
[51:56] blood be on us and our children God cut
[51:59] the Jews off and blinded their eyes so
[52:02] that the Gentiles could come in that 69
[52:05] weeks of Daniel was over one week left
[52:08] after the rapture according to the Bible
[52:13] according to the Bible only three and a
[52:16] half years of preaching left to them you
[52:19] don't get three and a half years of
[52:20] preaching you only get three and a half
[52:21] years of tribulation but there's seven
[52:23] years left according to the Bible and
[52:24] then I don't care what anybody says
[52:27] I really don't if an angel from heaven
[52:31] comes and preaches any other thing let
[52:32] him be accursed used to who know out
[52:37] cause you know what he can't deny what
[52:39] he said in the Bible he can't deny that
[52:44] he shall make a covenant with many for
[52:46] one week who's he he's the Antichrist
[52:49] what's one week one week equals seven
[52:52] years good grief
[52:54] so you know what it's so simple it
[52:57] blinds there 99% of the people in this
[52:59] message it blinds their eyes amen
[53:03] and they also if they buy not still in
[53:05] unbelief shall be graffed it in for God
[53:07] is able to graft them in again what's he
[53:09] gonna do he's gonna take that he grafted
[53:11] us in during the 2000 years of the
[53:13] church ages then he's not going to
[53:16] forget him he's going to take and graph
[53:19] them right back into the 144,000 during
[53:22] that one year or seven years of time
[53:26] after the rapture of us our rapture
[53:29] we're gone we have nothing to do with
[53:31] that wait listen the best thing we can
[53:37] do is is do like I did a couple years
[53:39] ago take the Daniel 70 weeks from a
[53:42] total Jewish perspective because it is
[53:44] not to us it's not it's not for us now
[53:50] it shows us in it
[53:51] where there's a division there word
[53:54] where the church ages come in but that's
[53:56] not to us that's to them they get to 70
[53:59] years of captivity they get to 70 weeks
[54:02] we're gone when that last week starts
[54:04] amen mm-hmm but now look I would not
[54:08] brethren that you should be ignorant of
[54:09] this mystery source of mystery but now
[54:13] remember even depaul it was a mystery
[54:17] because he didn't break that fifth seal
[54:19] I still didn't break during Paul's time
[54:22] he prophesied of it but he did have a
[54:30] revelation that blindness happened to
[54:34] Israel that the fullness of the Gentiles
[54:36] could come in he didn't know about the
[54:40] end grafton he could see all that
[54:41] grafting in and grafting out and putting
[54:43] in the wild olive Co that's in the Old
[54:45] Testament that's in the Old Testament
[54:48] Paul could read that it blind but see it
[54:51] doesn't say blindness but watch this
[54:53] unless you should be wise in your own
[54:54] conceits the blindness in part has
[54:55] happened to Israel until the fullness of
[54:57] the Gentiles be come in they you and I
[54:59] are right at the cusp of that the
[55:02] fullness of the Gentiles you and I
[55:04] finish up the fullness of the Gentiles
[55:07] everybody that's in the seven churches
[55:09] we are the end
[55:15] we're at the end of the whole Gentile
[55:17] dispensation the blindness in part
[55:20] happened to Israel until the fullness of
[55:21] the Gentiles be come in
[55:23] don't you think God he's he's just
[55:24] waiting he wants to go to that 144,000
[55:27] listen in a type with Joseph in just a
[55:30] minute
[55:30] Joseph was so glad to see his brethren
[55:32] but what was one kid he was glad to see
[55:35] he was glad to see old Benjamin he
[55:39] hugged him and cried why because they
[55:41] had to say mama and he was born after
[55:43] Joseph had left and what's that a type
[55:46] of the 144,000 that little Benjamin
[55:49] group Joseph went straight to him and so
[55:55] all Israel shall be saved that is
[55:57] written there shall come out of Zion a
[55:59] deliverer and shall turn away
[56:00] ungodliness from Jacob now who's Jacob
[56:03] Israel Jacob is Israel for this is my
[56:09] covenant unto them when I shall take
[56:11] away their sins
[56:15] now his covenant is that's 6 fold
[56:18] purpose because that's the restoration
[56:21] and the saving of Israel which is what I
[56:27] can understand reckless reconciliation
[56:30] for iniquity bringing the everlasting
[56:31] righteousness all those things you
[56:32] understand then
[56:34] so I said the 6 fold purpose to me
[56:36] explains all the Daniel 70 weeks if
[56:38] you'll just read the 6 fold purpose amen
[56:41] because the first three has to happen
[56:43] during the time of the two prophets the
[56:47] other three has to happen while
[56:48] everybody's gone because you can't you
[56:50] can't bring in everlasting righteousness
[56:51] before the Battle of Armageddon hello
[56:58] you can anoint the temple before the
[57:02] Battle of Armageddon there is no temple
[57:04] so it has to be built after the two
[57:07] prophets are gone it has to be built
[57:09] going into the Millennium and then
[57:11] that's its full purpose a wonderful
[57:14] statement brother Dale maze the six fold
[57:17] purpose puts Israel in the Millennium
[57:20] the revelation of the sixth seal puts us
[57:22] in the Millennium hey man so it's for
[57:25] both of us it's
[57:25] it parallels just a wonderful wonderful
[57:28] thing that we don't have time right now
[57:30] to go through the Daniel 7 to which we
[57:32] went through it last week if you have
[57:34] any questions please ask a question a
[57:35] minute I don't mind we've been over this
[57:38] too much - man we order no it just it
[57:42] ought to be a part of us and we
[57:44] shouldn't like I said but here we go
[57:46] again we shouldn't have to go back and
[57:47] say brother Brown said because he said
[57:52] what the Bible said you say oh I got
[57:56] this well if you got to quote this
[57:58] contrary to the Bible brother Branham is
[58:00] not wrong the Bible's not wrong so guess
[58:02] who's wrong you are well how many times
[58:09] did we read in the Bible Jesus said
[58:11] baptized the name of the Father in the
[58:13] name of the son in the name of the whole
[58:14] ego we read it to people and tried to
[58:20] convert them to it and it's what the
[58:22] Bible says but that ain't what the Bible
[58:25] says hey man it's it to me it's just it
[58:33] just it gets more clear in this sixth in
[58:37] this fifth seal a lot of things have
[58:39] cleared up for me myself and I hope this
[58:42] helps you clear things up and it's not
[58:43] just when you see a Grace when you see
[58:46] Grace extend it to you that blindness
[58:52] was in part to a group of people that
[58:53] God loved he cherished he held them he
[58:56] was married to that person Israel and he
[58:59] had to divorce her because of what she
[59:02] did which was which was the judgment but
[59:06] then he blinded their eyes so that we
[59:08] could come in and then he's going to
[59:10] lift that off of them we're going to
[59:13] read it here in just a minute right here
[59:15] we're gonna read it right here and once
[59:17] ya'll say unto him what are these wounds
[59:19] in thine hands
[59:21] now listen jesus is not going to
[59:25] physically appear to the Jews when we
[59:27] leave a man
[59:31] but they're going to see Jesus Christ
[59:34] through those two prophets they're gonna
[59:37] preach him so real until they're gonna
[59:41] see they put those wounds in his hand
[59:43] you and I've never seen the wounds in
[59:45] Jesus's hands have you but I believe it
[59:48] I believe it it's real
[59:51] and once you'll say unto him what are
[59:54] these wounds in thine hands then he
[59:55] shall answer those which which I was
[59:57] wounded in the house of my friends in
[1:00:01] the house of my friends remember Abraham
[1:00:05] was not a son of God Abraham was a
[1:00:06] friend of God only sons and daughters of
[1:00:09] God have the new birth in their soul
[1:00:12] Abraham did not have the new birth in
[1:00:14] his soul so he was a friend of God I'm
[1:00:18] just telling you what the Bible says
[1:00:19] remember the Bible is called Abraham the
[1:00:22] friend of God right so that's what has
[1:00:24] that those which I was wounded in the
[1:00:25] house of my friends awake o sword
[1:00:28] what word against my shepherd and
[1:00:31] against the man that is my fellow saith
[1:00:33] the lord of hosts smite the Shepherd and
[1:00:35] the Sheep shall be scattered and I will
[1:00:38] turn my hand upon the little ones who
[1:00:43] was the little one we just talked about
[1:00:44] Benjamin the Benjamin group is the
[1:00:49] 144,000 listen after we leave that's the
[1:00:52] last group to receive Christ as Savior
[1:00:57] because then everybody else dies and
[1:00:59] then we go to white throne judgment and
[1:01:01] the foolish virgin they are given
[1:01:03] eternal life but they didn't accept
[1:01:05] Christ here or they had already took a
[1:01:07] rapture I'm and a cup of water in my
[1:01:09] name all the people that's going to be
[1:01:10] good that's gonna be giving eternal life
[1:01:12] they gotta wait remember the Bible says
[1:01:14] the Dead lived not for a thousand years
[1:01:16] amen Zechariah 12 said I will pour upon
[1:01:21] the house of David now what was he
[1:01:23] talking about Jews Israel David was due
[1:01:26] and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[1:01:28] the spirit of what Grace and of
[1:01:31] supplication and they shall look upon me
[1:01:34] whom they have pierced and they show
[1:01:37] mourn for him as one mourning for his
[1:01:41] only son brother Brown said they'll come
[1:01:43] to realize
[1:01:44] that they killed him and they missed him
[1:01:46] they missed their Messiah and actually
[1:01:49] they physically put him on a cross amen
[1:01:52] and shall be in bitterness for him as
[1:01:55] one that is in bitterness for his
[1:01:57] firstborn in that day shall there be a
[1:01:59] great mourning in Jerusalem as the
[1:02:01] mourning of how to had a remand in the
[1:02:04] Bali
[1:02:05] kind of strange them comes up in the
[1:02:08] valley of Megiddo where the Battle of
[1:02:10] Armageddon is gonna be fought
[1:02:11] amen and the land shall mourn ever
[1:02:15] family apart thereby all right with that
[1:02:18] say Amen alright let's go to number
[1:02:20] three and read this real quick now who
[1:02:24] are these souls in that's the next thing
[1:02:26] who are they then if they are not the
[1:02:27] early church this is Israel that's to be
[1:02:30] saved as a nation all of them that are
[1:02:32] predestinated that's Israel that's
[1:02:34] Israel itself oh you say wait a minute
[1:02:36] they can't oh yes they are to be saved
[1:02:39] here let's settle it just a minute I got
[1:02:42] four or five scriptures I'll take one
[1:02:43] let's take Roman just a minute find out
[1:02:46] if they are Oh No let's keep the book of
[1:02:55] Romans and go to the eleventh chapter of
[1:02:57] Romans and we'll find out just let's
[1:02:58] just read it and then we'll have it by
[1:03:00] ourselves Romans the eleventh chapter
[1:03:02] 25th 26th verse no listen it Paul Paul
[1:03:05] said if anyone else even an angel preach
[1:03:07] any other gospel what he was to be
[1:03:09] cursed watch probably would not brethren
[1:03:12] that you should be ignorant of the
[1:03:13] mystery we just read that lets you be
[1:03:15] wise in your own conceits there you are
[1:03:16] the blindness in part has happened to
[1:03:18] Israel until the full full filling
[1:03:20] fullness of the Gentiles be come in the
[1:03:22] last Gentile bride be brought in for the
[1:03:25] bride the blindness comes to Israel for
[1:03:28] that purpose all right and so all Israel
[1:03:30] shall be saved that is written there
[1:03:32] shall come out of Zion a deliverer we
[1:03:34] just read that and shall turn away
[1:03:35] ungodliness for Jacob right now they are
[1:03:37] Israel that's under this altar Israel
[1:03:41] was blinded for the very purpose of us
[1:03:43] being saved you believe that now who
[1:03:46] blinded them God God blinded his own
[1:03:51] children no wonder Jesus standing there
[1:03:53] at the cross and them Jews howling for
[1:03:55] his blood that was his own kids
[1:03:57] and he was the scripture he was his self
[1:04:00] the word in here he knowing look knowing
[1:04:05] that those people would have gladly
[1:04:07] received them they knew that Old
[1:04:11] Testament that's the reason he blinded
[1:04:17] them so that they wouldn't recognize him
[1:04:20] he came in such an humble way and
[1:04:22] blinded them to that that they wouldn't
[1:04:24] receive it see the scripture said they
[1:04:25] would do it and he blinded was blinded
[1:04:28] Jesus pitied them even so much as they
[1:04:30] father forgive them they don't know what
[1:04:33] they're doing they were blind Paul said
[1:04:35] they were blinded for a Cause for us
[1:04:38] notice now I want you to watch this real
[1:04:41] close they were given robes they didn't
[1:04:43] have them they were given robes white
[1:04:45] robes each of them now the Saints now I
[1:04:48] already have one they get it here but
[1:04:51] there they were given robes and the
[1:04:53] Saints already had theirs and gone on
[1:04:54] see they had not seen they had not a
[1:04:57] chance they had not a chance because
[1:05:04] they were blinded by God their own
[1:05:07] father so that the grace of God could be
[1:05:11] fulfilled so the bride could be taken
[1:05:13] from the Gentiles so I said blinded by
[1:05:16] grace grace is what blinded the grace to
[1:05:19] me and you is what blinded him the Jews
[1:05:22] amen so are we recipient of the fifth
[1:05:27] seal yes you say loss to the Jews yes it
[1:05:29] is but we're recipient of it and then
[1:05:32] there are hold on but there are
[1:05:34] recipient of us receiving Christ Oh
[1:05:37] hallelujah
[1:05:39] I like that amen now let's go to the
[1:05:41] next scroll it on that and talk about
[1:05:45] Joseph for a minute remember what
[1:05:46] happened in the story of Joseph Joseph
[1:05:49] would suppose the kill sold for thirty
[1:05:51] pieces of silver perfect type of Christ
[1:05:53] well when he went to Egypt what was he
[1:05:56] given he was given a Gentile bride the
[1:05:58] other of the children of Israel were cut
[1:06:01] off right just like what happened now
[1:06:05] cut off the children of Israel were cut
[1:06:07] off but what did when they come to get
[1:06:10] provisions
[1:06:11] what did Joseph remember Joseph didn't
[1:06:15] physically blind their eyes cuz he was
[1:06:17] one man during a story but they were
[1:06:20] blinded because he what he put on a
[1:06:22] different veil hello he put on a
[1:06:27] different veil and changed his voice
[1:06:30] I believe his voice was heard by the
[1:06:34] Gentile bride but not bothered because
[1:06:37] they they didn't know who he was they
[1:06:39] just they listened they assumed he was
[1:06:41] dead
[1:06:42] especially Reuben and all them that were
[1:06:45] you know they got caught up in that
[1:06:46] they're the ones that did that right
[1:06:48] Reuben and them knew what they had done
[1:06:50] to Joseph but they really didn't know
[1:06:52] what happened afterwards because they
[1:06:53] lost touch with him during 2000 years he
[1:06:56] was getting a Gentile bride and they
[1:06:59] were thinking he was dead
[1:07:00] amen but what happened when he come back
[1:07:04] and he said hey cuz remember during that
[1:07:08] story remember God crossed the arms of
[1:07:10] the two twins that came out right
[1:07:13] brother Larry one was the younger and
[1:07:14] one supposed to be the ribbon was tied
[1:07:16] on the first one to come out because I
[1:07:18] was the first born memory he pulled his
[1:07:21] arm back and the second baby was born
[1:07:24] God had crossed him he said what
[1:07:26] happened he said I didn't cross her arms
[1:07:28] he said God crossed her arms why it was
[1:07:30] the old Orthodox Jew that now had a new
[1:07:32] kid us amen perfect time then you come
[1:07:40] up with Joseph Ariens now he's standing
[1:07:42] in a court with all of his brothers
[1:07:45] standing around him his own blood
[1:07:47] brothers and they didn't know who he was
[1:07:49] but what did he do he sent the Gentile
[1:07:52] bride to the castle sent her a raptured
[1:07:59] her into the castle and then what'd he
[1:08:03] do he revealed himself to the Jews he
[1:08:07] revealed itself and yet What did he say
[1:08:09] he said this was to preserve you this
[1:08:13] was to preserve life this was so I could
[1:08:16] get a Gentile bride and that we can have
[1:08:19] two children the whole story we could we
[1:08:21] could go all over the story but let's
[1:08:22] don't go through it but it
[1:08:23] the story of Joseph as the type of cross
[1:08:26] but read it with this fifth seal in mine
[1:08:28] where he revealed itself now after the
[1:08:30] Gentile brides gone he reveals herself
[1:08:32] to his brethren and then they're saved
[1:08:34] right he gives him all that provision
[1:08:37] they're saved he brings them in right so
[1:08:40] now let's read the fifth seal now notice
[1:08:43] these souls under the altar was these
[1:08:44] the souls understanding now that now
[1:08:48] that are under the altar while they were
[1:08:50] martyred by sinful men like Eichmann see
[1:08:53] they're holding right on millions of
[1:08:55] them but they remain Jews now remember
[1:08:58] what is it they were killed for the word
[1:09:00] of God's sake not for the testimony of
[1:09:03] Christ do you understand that but
[1:09:04] remember the church come in also the
[1:09:07] martyrs of the church was for the Word
[1:09:09] of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:09:11] that makes us different right we have
[1:09:13] the testimony of Jesus Christ here
[1:09:15] how many knows that here - all right but
[1:09:18] these don't have the testimony of Jesus
[1:09:19] Christ for the word of God and for the
[1:09:22] testimony which they held as Jews and
[1:09:24] Hitler hated them so denied Minh so did
[1:09:26] Stalin all of the rest of the world but
[1:09:30] they stayed true do you know that the
[1:09:32] United States knew they were killing
[1:09:33] those Jews the United States and England
[1:09:37] knew from 1942 to 1944 what they were
[1:09:40] doing and didn't do anything about it
[1:09:42] I'm gonna read it to you in this article
[1:09:44] it kind of strange that my hometown
[1:09:47] newspaper on the day I'm gonna speak on
[1:09:50] this writes a whole full page article
[1:09:53] about the Holocaust that's not strange
[1:09:59] because it proves a lot of things were
[1:10:02] that we we didn't live through but we
[1:10:04] had we've got right we've got good pure
[1:10:06] history you know it didn't happen 5,000
[1:10:08] years ago it happened only 100 years or
[1:10:10] 50 years 60 years ago for the Word of
[1:10:13] God and for testimony which they held as
[1:10:15] Jews and Hitler hated them so tonight my
[1:10:17] soldier Stalin all the rest of the world
[1:10:18] but they stayed true to what they
[1:10:19] believed and they killed them because
[1:10:22] they were Jews that's all I mean it was
[1:10:27] just because they were Jews now let's go
[1:10:29] to number 5 mmm now watch they had in
[1:10:33] their blindness martyred their Messiah
[1:10:36] let's
[1:10:37] go back 2,000 years all right back to
[1:10:40] the cross they had in their blindness
[1:10:44] martyred their Messiah and now they were
[1:10:47] reaping for it they realized that they
[1:10:50] recognized after it was gone on they
[1:10:54] seen then when they come before the
[1:10:56] altar of God now what's he talking about
[1:10:58] when those fifth seal Jews died and they
[1:11:00] went under that ought martyrs altar they
[1:11:02] realized they martyred Jesus cuz look it
[1:11:06] says right there and now they were
[1:11:07] reaping for it they seen then they come
[1:11:10] before the altar of God but now the
[1:11:12] grace of God is to them now watch now
[1:11:16] they could not by no means be Saints
[1:11:18] because they would already be robed but
[1:11:20] here they are now just souls under the
[1:11:22] altar for the word of God testimony they
[1:11:24] hell for being God's people the Jews but
[1:11:26] now watch the grace every time you read
[1:11:30] ever read the fifth seal circle every
[1:11:31] time brother Ram said graves it's
[1:11:33] phenomenal how many pages of grace is in
[1:11:35] this because it it's to see that's the
[1:11:37] grace seal the grace of God comes to
[1:11:40] them and Jesus gives them each one a
[1:11:42] white robe watch plumb over after the
[1:11:44] church is gone because they were loyal
[1:11:47] to their cause and they were blinded and
[1:11:49] they didn't know it they didn't know it
[1:11:52] they were playing exactly the part that
[1:11:54] God had ordained for them to play and
[1:11:56] here John looks over and sees sold under
[1:11:59] the altar now watch he sees those souls
[1:12:02] watch what he calls them they cry Lord
[1:12:04] how long just a little while longer
[1:12:05] see let's get that as we go down through
[1:12:08] the scripture they realized they had
[1:12:09] been murdered they had murdered their
[1:12:11] Messiah and they didn't know it but then
[1:12:15] they realized they got murdered back to
[1:12:18] pay for it they got murdered by to pay
[1:12:23] for it for doing the wrong now look what
[1:12:27] a thing they had to do see they was
[1:12:28] guilty of murder
[1:12:30] so they got murdered wow that's pretty
[1:12:33] strong but that's exactly what happened
[1:12:35] they cried out his blood be on us see
[1:12:39] that's right and they were blinded now
[1:12:41] if they hadn't have been blinded God
[1:12:44] said let them alone they're not worthy
[1:12:45] but being that they were blinded by
[1:12:48] I got his grace reached down to them
[1:12:53] amen
[1:12:54] talk about Amazing Grace and give every
[1:12:58] one of them a row because all Israel
[1:13:00] will be saved every one that has his
[1:13:01] name written that's right let's continue
[1:13:04] reading still in the fifth seal I do not
[1:13:09] think by the opening I do think rather
[1:13:11] by the opening of this fifth seal as I
[1:13:13] believe that it's open to us I did it
[1:13:15] with good conscience with clear
[1:13:16] revelation before God not trying to just
[1:13:19] make it think because I always was
[1:13:21] against organization never would belong
[1:13:24] to him but it opened to me now now what
[1:13:27] he's going to talk about it what he's
[1:13:29] talked about I just kind of omitted some
[1:13:31] of that you remember when he comes to
[1:13:35] the Book of Revelations 9 he talks about
[1:13:37] the the two hundred thousand thousand
[1:13:39] horsemen being released they were
[1:13:42] released on this group of people but
[1:13:46] remember the classical was released on
[1:13:49] menu the organizations that were set up
[1:13:52] that's what he's talking about
[1:13:53] ok no but I look he changes the subject
[1:13:56] here for some unknown reason he just
[1:13:58] come pops right up and says I do not
[1:14:00] think you know I do think another thing
[1:14:02] by the opening of the fifth seal on this
[1:14:03] day straightens up a doctrine right here
[1:14:05] that I might speak of of soul sleeping
[1:14:07] and I just wanted to cover this in case
[1:14:09] somebody thought just looking in you
[1:14:11] never know so mind you in the message or
[1:14:14] whatever now I realize there's people
[1:14:16] here that does believe that and that
[1:14:19] doctrine is is when you die you go to
[1:14:21] the grave and your soul stays there with
[1:14:22] your body your soul stays in that grave
[1:14:25] and in kind of a limbo state see now
[1:14:28] that's the doctrine not in the message
[1:14:31] but this fifth seal disproves that
[1:14:34] because I think that this proves that
[1:14:37] they're not sleeping they're alive their
[1:14:40] bodies are sleeping but the souls not in
[1:14:43] the grave they're in the presence of God
[1:14:45] under the altar and let's keep reading
[1:14:48] around him now our to settle it for
[1:14:51] those who soul now watch it under the
[1:14:53] altar of the breaking of this seal that
[1:14:57] have been slain in the time now here
[1:14:59] he's taught the fifth seal Jew
[1:15:01] or the Jews that's been slain from the
[1:15:03] time between the death of Christ and the
[1:15:05] going up of the church the Eichmann
[1:15:08] group and all them true Jews with their
[1:15:10] name on the book if you'll watch my
[1:15:12] brother according to the scripture they
[1:15:13] could talk cry out speak here and had
[1:15:16] all five senses not sleeping in the
[1:15:19] grave unconscious they were very much
[1:15:21] awake and could talk speak hear anything
[1:15:24] else now we're going to paragraph 459
[1:15:26] brother Brown begins to hint he's
[1:15:28] humming only believe I think or I love
[1:15:30] him one now quietly reverently before
[1:15:32] God as we seen this seal open to us
[1:15:35] garden having to take his own beloved
[1:15:37] children and blind their eyes and send
[1:15:41] them because of his own judgment see
[1:15:43] remember he couldn't send them in the
[1:15:46] sixth dimension that's where the bride
[1:15:49] goes so he had to make a place for him
[1:15:52] a place of holding God happened to take
[1:15:57] his own we love children and blind their
[1:15:59] eyes and send them because of his own
[1:16:01] justice requires judgment of sin think
[1:16:03] of it his judgment justice and his
[1:16:06] holiness requires justice a law without
[1:16:09] a penalty is not a law and his own laws
[1:16:11] himself he cannot defy and still remain
[1:16:15] God that's the reason God had to become
[1:16:17] man he couldn't take a substitute a son
[1:16:21] that wasn't just an ordinary son to him
[1:16:23] or something God became both Jesus
[1:16:26] became both son and God the only way he
[1:16:29] could just Lee do it God had to take the
[1:16:32] penalty himself it wouldn't be just to
[1:16:35] put it on somebody else another person
[1:16:36] so the person of Jesus was God
[1:16:39] manifested in the flesh called Emmanuel
[1:16:41] now watch here's his whole point and to
[1:16:43] do that and to take a bride and to save
[1:16:47] a lost bunch of heathen Gentiles he told
[1:16:49] me and you he had to blind his own
[1:16:52] children and then punish them for it in
[1:16:55] the flesh for rejection but his grace
[1:17:01] provided rope his grace provided robes
[1:17:08] for every one of them you love the Lord
[1:17:11] hey man let's read this right here just
[1:17:13] from
[1:17:21] at the peak of the Holocaust the Nazis
[1:17:23] murdered 14 thousand Jews per day okay
[1:17:29] and the ledger of evils perpetrated by
[1:17:32] humans operation Reinhard holds a
[1:17:35] special place over the course of 21
[1:17:37] months starting in March 1942 Nazi
[1:17:40] forces and their collaborators rounded
[1:17:42] up 1.7 million Jews from 393 Polish
[1:17:47] towns so they were only dealing with
[1:17:49] Poland which is real close to Germany
[1:17:51] and ghettos and dispatched them in
[1:17:54] tightly packed rail cars to three camps
[1:17:56] in Germany occupied Poland's so BR
[1:17:59] Treblinka and Belzec at these three
[1:18:02] killing centers members of Poland's once
[1:18:05] thriving Jewish community were murdered
[1:18:07] with such efficiency and ruthlessness
[1:18:09] that roughly 1.5 million Jews who passed
[1:18:12] through their gates a mere 100 and 2
[1:18:15] would survive to bear witness by
[1:18:18] November of 1943 when operation Reinhard
[1:18:20] ended essentially no Polish Jews were
[1:18:24] left for the Germans to kill listen
[1:18:30] hitler's final jewish question was is
[1:18:33] get rid of not one of them or 100 of
[1:18:36] them all of them he was going to
[1:18:38] exterminate the whole kind of strange it
[1:18:41] he had a little Jewish background
[1:18:44] pitiful in it all right this guy drew
[1:18:47] upon a painstakingly account of Nazi
[1:18:49] train schedule to analyze the kill rate
[1:18:51] of Jews between February 42 and December
[1:18:54] 1944 with in operation Reinhard's 21
[1:18:57] month campaign of extermination he
[1:18:59] discovered a 92 day period that stands
[1:19:01] out for its ferocity in August September
[1:19:04] in October of 1942 he calculated German
[1:19:08] forces and their allies in Poland killed
[1:19:09] at least 1.3 2 million Jews that
[1:19:12] averages out to fourteen thousand three
[1:19:15] hundred and forty-eight Jews per day
[1:19:17] every day 14 thousand a day basically
[1:19:24] you take 1.3 million that's probably the
[1:19:26] population of
[1:19:28] Atlanta and within three months it's
[1:19:34] empty this concentration of murder in
[1:19:41] three month period likely created
[1:19:43] substantial confusion amongst its
[1:19:44] victims and it's speed would have made
[1:19:48] them wait made it impossible to organize
[1:19:50] the resistance the Jews calculated this
[1:19:53] thing they did it so fast because you
[1:19:56] know what if they started just bringing
[1:19:57] two or three of us out of the building
[1:19:58] you know some of us would kind of catch
[1:20:00] on and we we'd probably try to you know
[1:20:02] make us some get us some guns or
[1:20:04] something but they did it so fast that
[1:20:07] the possibility of organized resistance
[1:20:09] was difficult to coordinate in that time
[1:20:13] stone used the authority of estimates of
[1:20:16] the Holocaust toll on Jews which rain
[1:20:18] ranged from five point 1 million to 6.2
[1:20:22] million that's half of the state of
[1:20:24] Georgia I think Georgia's got 12 million
[1:20:25] people in the state half the state of
[1:20:28] Georgia was wiped out to reckon that as
[1:20:32] many as a quarter of the Nazis Jewish
[1:20:34] victims were murdered during these three
[1:20:36] months of operation reinhold although
[1:20:41] they all they were were preparing war
[1:20:43] crimes here it is my document recently
[1:20:45] unearthed from United Nations says the
[1:20:47] governments of the United States Britain
[1:20:49] and the Soviet Union were aware that at
[1:20:51] least at least two million Jews had been
[1:20:54] murdered and another five million were
[1:20:57] at risk of being killed although they
[1:20:59] were preparing war crimes against Hitler
[1:21:01] and his generals the Allied powers did
[1:21:03] little to protect or provide sanctuary
[1:21:05] for your excuse they were scared we
[1:21:10] exterminate them will exterminate you
[1:21:14] but this is where this this six million
[1:21:18] Jews we know where they're at now we
[1:21:21] know the reason that happened amen
[1:21:28] listen to this I'm gonna read this and
[1:21:30] then we'll then well I'm gonna read
[1:21:31] another statement an estimated two
[1:21:33] hundred ninety two thousand of the 1.3
[1:21:36] million perished during a spasm of
[1:21:39] violence they were killed by bullets by
[1:21:41] special
[1:21:42] shooting squads called the ox grouping
[1:21:44] the remaining were dispatched by poison
[1:21:46] gas within hours of their arrival at the
[1:21:49] death camp brother brems tells us in the
[1:21:58] feast of the trumpets he reads
[1:22:01] revelations 9 1 woe is past and behold
[1:22:03] there come two woes more Hereafter
[1:22:05] what were the three woes three wars
[1:22:10] first world war was over here comes two
[1:22:14] more second had to come and then we're
[1:22:15] looking for a third world war alright
[1:22:17] but we're not going to be here and the
[1:22:20] sixth angel sounded I heard a voice from
[1:22:22] the four horns of the golden altar which
[1:22:23] is before God saying to the sixth angel
[1:22:25] which had the trumpet loose the four
[1:22:27] angels which are bound in the great
[1:22:29] river Euphrates and the four angels were
[1:22:31] loosed which were prepared for an hour
[1:22:33] and a day in the month in the year for
[1:22:35] to slay the third part of men and the
[1:22:37] number of the army of the horsemen were
[1:22:39] two hundred thousand thousand and I
[1:22:42] heard the number of them brother branham
[1:22:44] talks on the fifth seal and the six
[1:22:46] sorry the feast of the trumpets
[1:22:47] paragraph 173 they don't have this I'm
[1:22:50] just going to read it now he loosed
[1:22:52] under that sixth seal those two hundred
[1:22:53] thousand spiritual demons started in
[1:22:55] Rome see they were released under the
[1:22:57] sixth seal but remember they had to come
[1:22:59] under that they brought that fish sealed
[1:23:00] you inside that alright if Whitney
[1:23:03] brother Brown was wrong okay and notice
[1:23:07] over in the Bible where they were they
[1:23:08] receive power as kings but weren't
[1:23:10] crowned
[1:23:11] because remember I went in Hitler never
[1:23:13] were Kings they were dictators but they
[1:23:17] never became a king but they acted like
[1:23:19] kings
[1:23:20] he said all the Spirit of God moving
[1:23:22] through me now just saying something I
[1:23:24] don't know how to say it
[1:23:26] he says notice two hundred thousand
[1:23:28] demons turned loose upon those Jews when
[1:23:30] they burned him they crucified him they
[1:23:32] put bubbles in their veins they killed
[1:23:34] him till they had no more gas to kill
[1:23:35] him with they shot him till they had no
[1:23:37] more bullets to shoot him with and they
[1:23:39] done everything they could do they
[1:23:41] cremated their bodies and everything
[1:23:42] hung them on fences
[1:23:43] innocent people because they were Jews
[1:23:46] they were done that way but God said he
[1:23:49] gave each one of them a robe undeserving
[1:23:52] as they were but His grace to blind
[1:23:55] so that we could see notice we find out
[1:23:59] natural power under the natural to a
[1:24:01] natural nation Israel was loosed and
[1:24:03] what did it do it went and made war and
[1:24:05] how it murdered and persecuted now in
[1:24:07] the ecclesiastical realm of it and I
[1:24:09] hope that God's open God opens your eyes
[1:24:11] to this now because I realize this is
[1:24:14] just not speaking to this church here
[1:24:16] this tape goes worldwide and I don't
[1:24:17] mean to hurt anybody's feelings
[1:24:18] now the ecclesiastical realm has been
[1:24:20] open from the natural revival of the old
[1:24:22] pagan Rome went forth on those Jews
[1:24:25] which was all has always been their
[1:24:27] enemy the lion with teeth and everything
[1:24:29] stomped down and broke out the people
[1:24:31] Rome always has been God's enemy and it
[1:24:34] was turned loose in the same spirit by
[1:24:36] the dictators of the world because the
[1:24:39] religious system was still holding
[1:24:42] during that time now he said it's been
[1:24:46] loosed so those two hundred thousand
[1:24:48] thousand demons the same demons that
[1:24:50] killed all those under Eichmann and
[1:24:51] Hitler are after me and you they're
[1:24:55] after us they're after us but you know
[1:24:57] what they can only they can only try
[1:25:01] their best but we live under the promise
[1:25:06] of God that says we're gonna take a
[1:25:09] rapture we're gonna take a body change
[1:25:11] we're going to come to a state of
[1:25:12] perfection we're going to have a body
[1:25:14] change and we're gonna take a rapture
[1:25:16] and all of you remember brother Branham
[1:25:18] he makes a statement I didn't put this
[1:25:19] down but in 1960 remember they had the
[1:25:22] nürnberg which they brought all the
[1:25:26] Chiefs in and they did to them what they
[1:25:29] did to the Jews but there was one called
[1:25:32] Adolph Eichmann he was the worst of the
[1:25:34] bunch dr. death they found him in 1960
[1:25:39] and then they tried him in 1961 and
[1:25:43] brother Branham on the fifth seal I
[1:25:44] didn't bring it but he says you see they
[1:25:46] just came through that what was that was
[1:25:48] the last one of that group that had been
[1:25:51] terminated because of the killing of the
[1:25:54] Jews he said see there he said that's
[1:25:55] ended so see that ended under when that
[1:25:58] person was killed that that spirit of
[1:26:00] that thing left and that was all under
[1:26:04] that's Adolf Eichmann in 1960 he was
[1:26:07] executed in not
[1:26:08] sixty-two but you see how rough this is
[1:26:13] but he protected a whole fifth seal Jew
[1:26:18] you know all this happened so you and me
[1:26:22] could come in them two hundred thousand
[1:26:26] thousand demons were held under the
[1:26:29] river euphrates not over there under a
[1:26:30] river good grief no they weren't under a
[1:26:34] river and all of a sudden God parted the
[1:26:36] waters and the demons came out know a
[1:26:39] man named Adolf Hitler and all these
[1:26:41] different ones
[1:26:42] they come up in power and Satan anointed
[1:26:45] them with all those demons and they
[1:26:47] decided they was going to kill but you
[1:26:50] know what
[1:26:51] poor Adolph Hitler he thought he was
[1:26:56] doing the world a service everybody down
[1:26:59] through those ages thought they was
[1:27:00] doing the world a service that getting
[1:27:02] rid of the Jews but in all actuality
[1:27:05] they working right into God's plan that
[1:27:09] I've preserved this group of people in
[1:27:11] secret and not gonna let you know about
[1:27:13] it until I come to it bring it to a
[1:27:15] prophet and let the fifth seal open
[1:27:17] showing my grace you think a dog Hitler
[1:27:20] had grace I don't feel it didn't have
[1:27:22] grace he want them all dead
[1:27:24] but in killing 6.8 million of them think
[1:27:28] about this that put them in the fifth
[1:27:32] dimension they're going to be eternal
[1:27:34] and that off Hitler is gonna go where he
[1:27:37] goes and all of his other people that
[1:27:38] thought they were doing God a service on
[1:27:41] earth by taking care of this group of
[1:27:43] people and in all actuality he was
[1:27:46] working right into the hand of God
[1:27:48] putting that same group of people he
[1:27:50] despised it's one day gonna walk the
[1:27:52] streets of gold with me and you side by
[1:27:55] side and they're gonna be giving eternal
[1:27:58] life they're gonna be giving white robes
[1:28:00] in their journey I mean and their
[1:28:03] continuous of the of the look of
[1:28:05] redemption hey man so the fifth seal
[1:28:10] nothing to me I see is but grace but
[1:28:14] that grace is extended to me in you that
[1:28:16] God saved you and you didn't want it
[1:28:21] you didn't want it but now that we do
[1:28:24] have it now that we do realize that
[1:28:27] there's a place for the fifth seal Jew
[1:28:29] there's a place for in the sixth
[1:28:31] dimension for all the the dead that's
[1:28:33] went on that's got the baptism of the
[1:28:35] Holy Ghost they're waiting but you know
[1:28:36] what they're all waiting on me and you
[1:28:41] they're waiting on menu to come to a
[1:28:44] place that we realize that not grace is
[1:28:47] coming grace is here grace is a person
[1:28:51] grace is Jesus Christ that come to you
[1:28:54] and took your sin away and he can't
[1:28:57] remember just like that fifth seal Jew
[1:29:00] he can't give him white robes if he
[1:29:02] remembers what they've done I believe he
[1:29:03] throwed at it and see if forgetfulness
[1:29:05] and said this is my group of people
[1:29:06] right here I'm gonna have this group of
[1:29:08] people they're gonna be special
[1:29:10] but I blinded their eyes so that I could
[1:29:14] take a Gentile bride and then when we
[1:29:17] move out of the way he's gonna go take
[1:29:19] 144,000 bring them out of this world and
[1:29:22] put them in the same place you in our
[1:29:25] let's stand our feet god bless you
[1:29:29] there's your fifth seal grace
[1:29:34] amazing grace it's grace my you think
[1:29:41] about a group of people now now let me
[1:29:46] make this clear like I said before I
[1:29:49] don't think this is every Jew that
[1:29:51] considered their self with you because
[1:29:54] remember God knows the heart he knows
[1:29:57] that person and if they just said well
[1:30:00] okay I'm a Jew you know I mean you
[1:30:02] understand what I'm saying program said
[1:30:04] those who are predestinated God knows
[1:30:06] their heart and when they're standing
[1:30:08] there in that gas chamber you know what
[1:30:10] they may cry out they may say jehovah oh
[1:30:13] the only norman's Jehovah Jehovah God
[1:30:15] come and help us and he did sure they
[1:30:19] had to be killed by the millions but
[1:30:20] when that flesh body went into the
[1:30:22] ground that soul went over into the
[1:30:25] dimension now which ones which ones
[1:30:26] greater cuz that soul of that person is
[1:30:30] going to come back here in a glorified
[1:30:33] body listen they're not going
[1:30:34] around justice theophanies they go get a
[1:30:37] glorified body just like you guys hey
[1:30:39] man what a wonderful wonderful God we
[1:30:42] serve sing something man singing Amazing
[1:30:45] Grace how sweet the sound
[1:30:47] [Music]
[1:30:56] you take about what God did for you when
[1:31:00] you were standing out in the world and
[1:31:02] say that you didn't care one thing about
[1:31:04] Gunn you care what about grace you
[1:31:07] didn't care what everybody going to
[1:31:09] church
[1:31:12] can't care though you're the time in the
[1:31:17] nether but God had a point not had a way
[1:31:23] to get to you that no one else in this
[1:31:25] world know how to do yeah momma can't
[1:31:28] save me and daddy can't save me your
[1:31:30] brother can't save you
[1:31:31] not all bodies the only person that can
[1:31:33] save my heart
[1:31:39] Jeffie you know I think about when John
[1:31:41] Newton was write that song he looked
[1:31:44] down at those slaves all those years he
[1:31:47] was a slave trader here they took slaves
[1:31:49] back and forth across the ocean and he
[1:31:52] would listen to them not say Amazing
[1:31:54] Grace but they would sing a song that
[1:31:55] had that same rhythm to it from their
[1:31:59] homeland a group of people they did not
[1:32:01] know where they were going did not know
[1:32:04] where they were gonna land did not know
[1:32:06] where they were gonna be they were sawn
[1:32:09] into slavery by man but all thank God
[1:32:14] then one day John never found God
[1:32:18] and that's all he could say was Amazing
[1:32:22] Grace
[1:32:26] already car
[1:32:31] oh praise praise God praise God praise
[1:33:02] God praise God praise God praise God
[1:33:12] [Applause]
[1:33:14] [Music]
[1:33:17] praise God you thank him today praise
[1:33:20] God
[1:33:22] raised of praise yah praise God
[1:33:30] praise God let's say you like this oh
[1:33:34] when we fit there 96 10,000 years
[1:33:40] [Music]
[1:33:43] ever more bright shine
[1:33:47] [Music]
[1:33:53] we will have no less days we know
[1:33:58] last days tennis a heart ring
[1:34:08] [Music]
[1:34:11] you know that there's about three more
[1:34:13] verses of that song that I'd like to
[1:34:17] find because man it talks about your
[1:34:19] flesh and about all the yeah his word
[1:34:23] has promised good to me his faith my
[1:34:26] hope and or I can't get the rest I will
[1:34:30] find it though because really that's the
[1:34:32] original verses that John Newton wrote
[1:34:34] and then he wrote these afterwards but I
[1:34:37] really like the ones that that was that
[1:34:39] was wrote first because it really has
[1:34:41] another meaning to them but it is
[1:34:43] amazing great man when you look at what
[1:34:46] happened where you came from
[1:34:48] it's as its as a miracle as that fifth
[1:34:52] sealed you
[1:34:57] but you and I are holding this whole
[1:35:00] thing up we're lining those seals up
[1:35:05] brother Dale's bringing in the church
[1:35:06] ages we've had Daniel 70 weeks we're
[1:35:10] coming to a place folks so I said this
[1:35:13] year 2019 is going to be a special year
[1:35:16] we're gonna see a lot of things but
[1:35:19] remember when you see when you say that
[1:35:21] in the Christian realm you got to
[1:35:23] remember that as some go some go brother
[1:35:27] Brown says some will be able to go all
[1:35:29] the way someone I'll be able to go all
[1:35:30] the way some will be able to take it
[1:35:32] some won't be able to take it but you
[1:35:34] know what if you live his promise live
[1:35:40] his promise do what he says he's got
[1:35:43] that's what he did with the Jews they
[1:35:45] stood there and said we are Jews we are
[1:35:50] God's people and Hitler said well you're
[1:35:55] gonna die and they said well we can't
[1:35:57] deny who we are you just got to do with
[1:36:00] us what you're gonna do with us a man
[1:36:02] same way with us I mean what are you not
[1:36:04] looking at there's nothing we can do
[1:36:07] about this flesh it's in Satan's domain
[1:36:10] it's in Satan's eat
[1:36:12] fill the soul with the Holy Ghost
[1:36:14] knowing and working on that next man a
[1:36:16] man then this will have to lean into
[1:36:20] it'll have to lean toward that we're all
[1:36:22] leaning toward death what do you believe
[1:36:26] that or not every year that gets longer
[1:36:30] I'll be 59 here in a few days getting
[1:36:33] close to 60 some of you are well past
[1:36:36] that so we need we need to move on
[1:36:43] but take one day at a time I like what
[1:36:47] brother Claude said I'm going to leave
[1:36:48] you with this Matthew 24 says those who
[1:36:52] endure to the end shall be saved you
[1:36:56] won't know it until you get to the end
[1:36:58] if you really really got the goods but
[1:37:00] you will know it when you get closer
[1:37:02] toward that end you'll know that you
[1:37:05] know that you know that God has done a
[1:37:09] work in your life that God has done not
[1:37:11] just grace but Amazing Grace but let's
[1:37:14] don't make it greasy grace let's don't
[1:37:17] just live any way you want good let's
[1:37:20] come to church and do what we're
[1:37:21] supposed to do I'll say one more time if
[1:37:24] you have an office in this church you
[1:37:25] need to be here every time that
[1:37:26] something happens like that you need to
[1:37:28] be here because you know what people are
[1:37:29] watching you and when you don't show up
[1:37:33] what are you doing if we're putting an
[1:37:38] office we're fixing to elect officers
[1:37:41] again we got to do that pretty quick
[1:37:43] [Music]
[1:37:49] either we wanted to live it or we don't
[1:37:52] we're gonna pray over these cloths I
[1:37:54] want everybody to bow their head now
[1:37:57] this is for mm-hmm brother Micah and
[1:38:00] sister Mary what's the baby's name
[1:38:04] scarlet scarlet scarlet yeah scarlet
[1:38:07] we're gonna pray for those three they're
[1:38:09] going to Japan now as working for the
[1:38:12] government he's going to Japan to do
[1:38:14] something for a couple of years whatever
[1:38:16] time doesn't matter but we're gonna send
[1:38:18] these prayer cloths with them they're
[1:38:19] gonna take them with them and that we're
[1:38:21] gonna pray that God will anoint them the
[1:38:23] whole time they're there I don't know of
[1:38:25] a messege Church in Japan they might be
[1:38:27] one but they may not be close to one but
[1:38:30] they're gonna be 18 or 20 hours away
[1:38:33] from us but you know what that - God
[1:38:35] that ain't even that's not that much but
[1:38:40] we're gonna send these prayer cloths
[1:38:41] because we believe in it we believe that
[1:38:44] these cloths will do what they said
[1:38:47] they'll do because there was a group of
[1:38:48] people in the book of Acts that believed
[1:38:52] clothes that come off of Paul demons
[1:38:57] would leave when they'd lay that cloth
[1:38:58] on the people so if there's any demons
[1:39:00] over there we're gonna talk to them
[1:39:02] today and we're gonna send these cloths
[1:39:03] over there and wear these prayer cloths
[1:39:05] go the demons will flee amen let's bow
[1:39:10] our heads let's all pray together as you
[1:39:11] keep pleading the Emilee father we know
[1:39:13] it is truly amazing grace how sweet the
[1:39:16] sound that saved a wretch like me and
[1:39:18] now that we come under this umbrella
[1:39:21] that's called the bride lord we have an
[1:39:25] intimate relationship with you the
[1:39:27] creator and you told us through the book
[1:39:31] of Acts that we could take Klaus and
[1:39:35] pray over them and anoint them and send
[1:39:38] them out and the anointing of that cloth
[1:39:44] not just the material itself
[1:39:47] but the prayers of all the bride in this
[1:39:51] building is praying that were those
[1:39:54] claws are placed be a a drawer or in the
[1:39:57] car or over the door or anywhere they
[1:40:00] travel keeping them on their self a
[1:40:03] little scarlet that the demons will have
[1:40:07] to flee because not the power of the
[1:40:09] cloth but the power of the prayer behind
[1:40:11] it Lord we pray that you would anoint
[1:40:15] them truly for their journey that
[1:40:16] they're going to take father they're one
[1:40:19] of us we love them like our own children
[1:40:22] and Lord we pray that you'd protect them
[1:40:25] and that their little light would shine
[1:40:27] wherever they go and maybe as they go
[1:40:31] over there Lord they find some believers
[1:40:34] or maybe they see a group Lord that they
[1:40:37] want a witness to father just give them
[1:40:39] the anointing to witness to that group
[1:40:42] of people because everybody can be saved
[1:40:47] whether it be whatever nationality
[1:40:50] doesn't matter and the language barrier
[1:40:54] can be broken by you Lord speak through
[1:40:58] our brother and sister Lord and let they
[1:41:01] be a lighthouse Lord as they journey

[1:41:07] realize that there's things over there
[1:41:09] that's not over here sickness disease
[1:41:11] different demons but Lord we that's why
[1:41:15] we're sending these cloths to protect
