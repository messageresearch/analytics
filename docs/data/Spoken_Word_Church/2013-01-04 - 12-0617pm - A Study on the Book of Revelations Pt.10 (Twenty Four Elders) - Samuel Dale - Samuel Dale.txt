change the order of the service stand up please foreign only love me let's give these kids a good action you know what they're singing their participation and all that really put their hearts to it you can hear them singing and we appreciate it amen good to see in the house of the Lord and in the house of the Lord if you like turning your scripture turn to Revelation 1 where we've been reading thank you try to continue on our I wonder what we're talking about a study of the Book of Revelations going on through the the things that we see and thank God for the truth right and it was a day that we couldn't read these and even hardly talk about it because we would be talking about um man and his philosophy you know people have had ideas of what this meant to remember and and remember the the story wrote around told about you know that it would be the holy spirit with a little Cupid arrow shooting the people you know and this that or the other we'll see that's that was man's and his ideas you know told you one time about my brother-in-law talking about that big beast you know he saw that revelation that it'd be a great big King Kong you know walking across the Earth you know I said I don't think I'd fooled anybody religiously you know and I just then one man one time was talking about how the the buzzards remember the birds are in Revelations will eat off of the people and said you know it said the buzzards are hatching three or four the time now instead of like one I suppose all right but what do you mean he said well you know over there in the Bible where the buzzers eat off the people said you gotta have more buzzers you know I said well okay you know that's fine I didn't think anything to do with coming of the Lord but or the ending of all things but you know that's man and their ideas we've all had our opinions our thoughts I told you that I used to think as a kid that when somebody had told me when the Lord would be coming he'd come with an umbrella you know I don't know where I got it but you know every time I see a cloud come up I'd run out and look to see if there's an umbrella in it and you know if I didn't see an umbrella I thought well I'm doing pretty good I made it past this one you know but that's just her way of thinking right of the word of God Amen but thank God for the prophet of God that was sent unto us to expound these things and to us and now then it becomes so simple until why didn't we read these things ourselves you know and relate to it it wouldn't take see it couldn't be a theologian try to figure these things out because we would have the wrong thoughts and approach it would have to be you know someone uh different from that okay Revelations one your lord Jesus we love you we thank you for all things we know that you give them to us freely we pray that you'd come this afternoon and speak to our hearts and direct each and every one of us that we may see you Lord and be directed in your love and father just have your way with us and open our understanding and we know that we can talk about the word and talk about the symbols and how they've been broken and the prophet has delivered it unto us and all that's wonderful but anybody can talk about that it takes a special people as we started off talking about a special people in the Book of Revelations that would be able to understand this book you would take one with prophetic insight not just a prophet to bring it but with prophetic insight to be able to comprehend what has been brought unto us we love you and we thank you have your way now blessing God each one in Jesus name Revelations 1. 1 through three as we've been reading the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sin and signified it lays Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand you may be seated Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we're trying to continue on with our thoughts and and you know trying to comprehend things and leading up to the Revelations chapter 5. I'm enjoying getting dark it's okay I know how good it'll be when we get there but we just appreciate it now remember this morning I tried a background before I start into the next message because I want you to see that it all ties together and to me what would you call it a multiple form of revealing or something you know uh what would be the words there I'm not a educated person but to me there's many things shown but it's not many different things it's many different uh ways or thoughts of seeing maybe not waves because that deals with putting too much into a problem but ways of seeing things from different ones you remember there in the Bible that one of the writers of the Gospel he saw one blind man one of the others he saw two well that's not a contradiction he's just two different people seeing it right you know and one of them back in the crowd didn't get to see the two the other one up there was dropped first and he saw the two you know the other one just maybe seeing one from a side view and and they wrote what they saw and you'd say well don't you believe the Lord could lead them to all of them get together about the same thing well that's the marvelous thing that I love about the word of God that God used man to write it he didn't use theologians we couldn't have understood it right you know too proper of a words you know in all of the big fancy you know what is your M good well I never didn't know what input meant hardly you know and I couldn't understand but you know and those big fancy words people use that's okay but it's just plain old simple language and anybody with us a great education or to be able to understand someone who speaks in a Common Language whereas maybe those in a Common Language couldn't comprehend what was said in the higher ups you know but it's like I've always said their life in our ways you go up North and and you know they want to say tomatoes and potatoes let's do it but then they'll say what'd you say you know and but if you go up there and say I want some Mater's and taters they'll go knifing all the way but they'll come back to what you ask for because you can understand knows what education can understand those who are not educated so let's get it down to where we're at maybe you want scripture for it the Common People heard him gladly all right so we spoke in a Common Language to where they could understand all right but they're just trying to get a few thoughts in our mind to where we can can look at pain and see the message is mourning of what we saw one saw the throne and then we saw one sitting on the throne but then we saw a rainbow around about the one that was sitting on the throne you know and all of these things we talked about in a covenant you know and we've seen that we don't see but part of it here knows when we get there we'll get a message of cheer down through time no more than we see the full rainbow over the earth and the arches of the earth you know but I said you look up to heaven and you see a rainbow around about the Sun or something like that or I don't know maybe somebody around the moon but I waited some time around the Sun but that's in the Heavenly forms to where we can understand so when we get there when we get there you know we'll see it right and we'll realize realization and that rainbow is a covenant but I didn't get to finish up what I said you could spend weeks preaching on one thought you know because you think about it you know that when we get there will be symbolics of things that happened on Earth but they won't be needed anymore but I don't believe in doing away with any of the attributes of God I've always tried to express that to you what we want to do away with them you know I mean we we have troubles at home because we you know we had a little uh things that the kids done or whatever and and little cards my wife will tell me say take these cards into the basement but I mean we got boxes of cards you know that you don't want to get rid of them you know because they have some meaning to you you know you want to hold on to that thought but I don't believe there would be anything I've always told you I believe when we get there you'll see the nail prints in his hand I'd be wonderful you said no we don't need that there are going to be a glorified body well according to the prophet when he raised he had male prince in his hand I thought he raised to the glorified body I didn't know you know that's that's just the point and uh then by being that away you know that when we get over there we won't need a covenant right now I can get this from right around him I just wrote that across because I thought it was a minute ago see if not finishing up this morning when we get there we won't need a covenant he said well why is the rainbow there then is there because it's wonderful you'll never be going away with it it'll always be there you'll always be able to see the rainbow the Covenant with man but we don't need a covenant once we're redeemed right that's right we won't need the nail prince in his hands but we'll see that what they've done for us all right we won't need the stripes in his back to heal us but they can be higher he said oh you have such a narrow mind I agree with you but I love it you know just leave me alone and it's not been crazy I guess all my life and just leave them alone this is the way I think I just think about you know him and and his doings and things I don't believe there's going to be a throne over here and a little Halo of light floating around over here you know and something over Yonder a dove or something you know and I can say well hey father where's the southern half well he's over here you know no Jesus said if you've seen me you've seen the father all right then there won't be any trouble when we get there you see that's too close to Oneness no you know what I'm trying to tell you is is the reasoning it's not too close to Oneness because the bride is the in the same form he's in and the one just can't handle that they say Jesus was the last form and I don't agree with it I believe the bride of Christ is the last form of God on the earth and this dispensation then they'll be the Jewish amen there'll be Redemption for them they'll be things you know so there's many things to to think about but just think about it the rainbow will be there but not as a point that it has to be there of a covenant it'll be there because that was the Covenant and God don't do away with anything he just he just keeps adding to as long as he keeps adding to then uh we'll be happy right all right now think about that then and think about the things we tried to say this morning and try not to back up too much but just to to go on let's read our scripture we've got nothing else to Revelations 4 verse 4. let's read this and just take on this thought let's read verse three to turn on back and he that set up on was said he that set was to look upon like a Jasper and a sardine stone there was a rainbow round about The Throne inside of like unto an emerald and we didn't even get to that and you know um Emerald was a skirt of color brought around spoke of you know like in the the pillar of Fire in the looks you know where the door firing the way it is in the way of it going you know right round about The Throne were Four and Twenty seats and upon the seats I saw Four and Twenty Elders sitting clothed in white arraignment and they had on their heads crowns of gold now Four and Twenty owners who is that we said Wellness we've known it you know it's the 12 apostles the 12 Patriarchs we've known that actually because the prophet has told us that from before but just remember then yet even at this time of what you're seeing would be the future when we would be there all right then the Old Testament people are getting involved right because you got to twelve Patriarchs and in doing that see then this Plan of Redemption has been a wonderful thing it was not just for the 12 Patriarchs that's just the simple part to show you the Old Testament is tied together that is the part that shows as we'll see in a minute that makes that rainbow Covenant around the throne because it will tie together the the the showing that Redemption was back there Waiting on Jesus Christ to pay the price but at this time that we're in glory it can go on because now you know that catch the point of what I'm saying and you'll follow the point through the message see this this goes this scene that we see here goes to the white throne all right goes to throw on judgment amen all right so don't get lost in your thoughts before we get there and try to figure it out you know I'm saying when all that that can't be us and them that are together where would that be you know well we just you know go along do we understand all right this is after the Rapture though all right and the reason I said now that you've got to tie it together to the what to the throne is because after the Rapture your Redemption is not complete for the 12 tribes of Israel right right you agree yes we go up in a Rapture yes so this moves us a little further over all right I hope you follow from now on because we're moving over more in the Book of Revelations we're moving over to like 17. we'll come back picking these up because we're moving over to the Judgment Throne to look at it more instead of just saying this is in heaven because in the rapture we go there and we will be with him in the throne but then there comes a time that that it's completed I'm not listen to my point that rainbow wouldn't be complete if there was people that was still to be redeemed now I'm not talking about foolish virgins to be given eternal life into white Throne no no no no no no no don't go over there keep witness stay where I'm at see the Plan of Redemption is not complete until Israel is redeemed right are you following me there's 144 000 to be redeemed after the Rapture of the bride of Christ everybody go with me on that all right so then the rainbow would be made complete see Esther looking at it when you're sitting on the throne me as a judgment without that full Plan of Redemption but we can see our part and that's basically what we've been doing up to this point we've been dealing and we will deal a minute with this here our part then we ended up this morning talking about that there's just one on the throne but that one on the throne is almighty God with a many membered body amen no he ain't got a body yes yes they're still in the symbolics it's the throne it's where we go when we leave here we go to the marriage supper we go to do those things you know but it just means that the Throne of God that was in the Earth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the individuals the bride of Christ has been made complete on Earth and it goes up to match that which is sitting there you know as a throne so we see our part of it yes now we're going to move over just a little and then we'll come back to our part of it again in Revelations 5. huh but see at this point you see 24. see it's and you see 24-hours all right so it's got to move over now up into as far as the white throne at this point that we would begin in verse 4. you would move over a drastic amount of time at least three and a half years from the time of the rapture to the 144 000 in their completion well see if you don't bring them up then you wouldn't have a complete rainbow now that's the reason I kept emphasizing this morning when you take the seven golden candlesticks the rainbow the things put them together you're talking about the bride seven golden candlesticks is not dealing with Israel all right right it's dealing with the bride of Christ through the church ages so when we're seeing our part right our part we come to the white I mean to the throne of God and it at that point it is not a judgment seat it is a raptured condition right now right right right then we'll move over to a judgment seat amen and judge angels and we go on down to work terms the Lightnings and thunderings but here is showing on whether you would call it an insert or what you would call it but it's showing that there's a 24 elders so what we just realized there's 12 Apostles and 12 Prophet you know uh Apostles okay but the only place you can bring the Twelve Apostles and the 12 Patriarchs together would have to be when the Plan of Redemption is over right amen right that's right and see that's at least three and a half years after week Walk The Rapture okay as at least is enough to worry that we we you know we want to get out of here and Rapture right right man so do we see our part now and then we'll try to pick back up with these 24 Elders you know you see that we come to that Throne that's not a judgment Throne right there in the verse one two three the it's not a judgment throne it's the Throne of God as we said a moment ago that's been in our heart completed upon Earth Redemption for the Gentiles is finished and then we go up in a rapture now makes the Throne of God complete see then you'll start talking about the Lightnings the Thunder and tonight don't do that just keep it step by step very slow until we get there all right but do you see our part then that we are actually now right by the baptism of the Holy Ghost sitting actually in the throne that's right amen because God's Throne is right here in our heart all right that's wonderful that's right that don't do away to watch up there you know what really that is there and if people could understand these little points you would understand about theophthans and and things like that and they wouldn't have a body up yonder and it's down here and not over there can't get it together they would understand why brother Brown would say your shoulders you see off me that's right in here but only how's the negative amen only how the earnest of that right the rest is in heaven that's just like the new bird in faith right you don't have all of these virtues you have portions of things right right but then one day when you attain to these virtues and The Headstone come you know what's been pulling us that positive right yeah it's pulling this upward that's right simple form of rapture being resurrected right sitting in Heavenly place it raising up to meet him and then hire right and in doing so when we come to the place here to match what's dark we're going to go to that terminal and that'll make you the Judgment Throne right there you you've got a mad supper you got other things to be involved Tim clubfit he said we just go from here to there well there's a lot from here to there you know I mean brother dick ain't tell me brother Dale you know what you call it the no I've been buying it the Statue of Liberty when he gets to stop and just waved at him or her or what's up there but he's been all up in there you know he could come back and tell me all about it because he's been there and he said can't you see right here Brother David standing right here we're right now standing right and that's the way preachers preaching them we're right now standing right here it you know the tower there I said no brother dick I'm right here you might be there because you've been there but I haven't been there so I can't be there you tell me all about it that's true all right brother random would come and say see I'm not saying the Lord's coming I'm saying he's here people say the Lord's here probably said he was here well God said he was here before the world ever started what I've always said we spent seven thousand I'm going into seven now we spent six thousand years trying to prove his God up in heaven he spent six thousand years trying to prove he's on Earth that's right we just got the thing all messed up but you get the point of what I'm saying yes we've got to complete what we said this morning before we can talk about these 24 elders all right see then when the Bride In Christ becomes one the rainbow is around about the throne because it's the Covenant because that's all of our Covenants then we get to it in a minute but there's still something left for Israel they got to be brought into the picture but we're not concerned with that right now you know anybody wants to know who the two witnesses is go to Israel last time if we do the name or address the telephone number and call them up and say good luck voters you got a problem when we get out of here but what else can I tell them what yeah see didn't we have to keep it where we are and when that Throne is completed in our hearts adoption headstone whatever you want to call it coming into our hearts and our lives upon this Earth he said well it sure don't look like it well it never did look like it before what are you going to take the example to judge by e but then we must get everything right here and it matches that then we'll go there amen then we can see we're around the throne we can see that we're not just around the throne we're on the throne that makes the Throne of God complete amen now listen to the statement unless that Throne is complete there's no need of talking about 24 Elders right right they're around the throne you better remember if you're going to believe it's 24 hours you better change the scene for a second to remember that 12 of those 24 are the apostles don't you think that they're sitting on in the throne Rapture right let's complete our part right me let's get to plan a Redemption for us gentiles let's study the message and climb and pray and you know climb up the statue of a perfect man and praying seek God for our part amen don't do me any good to know what their party is it's wonderful to study what's my part you know I mean these people let's write books you know and they and then these people that read those books they just get so involved in reading books until you know they just get right in there with it and they're actually living out those things you know and that becomes what you call a fantasy world because you're right you're reading about what somebody else does and you know if you ever thought about all of these books that's wrote about kids is written by old maids and bachelors how to raise kids now there's no need of you writing a book about how to raise kids you don't know you've never experienced it until you've experienced it you don't know what US old dirty old Granddaddy's look like or talk about you think we're crazy man I pick that kid up and I'll explain tonight I'm sitting down good you know yeah we'll give you one yeah and you become so mellow we call it Melancholy or something I don't know what the word where you just become so soft but that's am I right am I telling the truth yes Dr Zeus probably never had any kids at all and neither one about the kids with the movies and the things that they made you know and all these other I've never had a kid but listen you and I have experienced something right yeah we've experienced a life in Christ amen by the new birth that's right we've experienced this message being brought into us we've experienced the reading of it right we've experienced even the uh the part that would go with it you know that they said well Lou ain't nothing but word word that's all we want to do is word word well that's all I knew there was about it that's all right and I've always said maybe we do just have the letter of the word but if the Holy Ghost could ever get that alive we got something what about the ones that don't have the letter of the word right how could the holy ghost ever make alive anything to them but just get the point we've got to find ourselves see ourselves before we enter the fourth verse and be able to to see what is transpiring and being able to see that even the fourth verse and then going into the fifth of the lightning the throne is is the Judgment seat so then let's get the right part here but I don't know what goes over there you know that's good but people who want to know what's going to go on tomorrow don't know what's going on today I'm gonna repeat that that's good thought I just thought of that girl you know what I'm talking about yes people are always wanting to know brother gave me a big old book a long time ago and he wanted to know about 1977. you know he wanted me to put down everything I could get on 77. when I never did do a thing with it I throw the book away probably not a year ago but people that say well write down what this is what does it do me write it down the Holy Ghost has got to reveal it right but you get what I'm saying see we're going to make a vast jump in these verses that's going to move on up into a a later period of time but we got to get this time right we don't know all the Mysteries by letter is one thing and I believe that's what Paul was talking about you were talking about Revelation Mysteries when he said now you you never went to jump through that's all I don't beat Paul when he said to know all Mysteries you know and I'm not charity he's not talking about Holy Ghost revealed mystery now I do not believe that I'm just as funny as I can be with you all right I believe that's intellectual learning of the word because if you understood all the Mysteries by revelation you tell me that's not love you tell me that's not charity you tell me that's not the headstone me but we just make our own thoughts about it see and we hear bread around them you say well you know we'll say something about do you know the do you know about this the Bible says the prophet said we could know all Mysteries and still not have love d well you ought to look at them say you don't think I got your love that's what you want to say to them you just saying I don't have any love all right but listen can you understand we went through uh nine non-message uses number 10. coming up to this place to understand now we must divide things then we will go a few verses and then we'll get into the fifth chapter which will bring us back down to an understanding to where we want to to start talking all right but just to get these things out of the way oh we call it a breach Ed we went to a place now that that God is not dealing in Redemption with you and I if the throne is complete and the rainbows round about the throne and the bride sitting on the throne with him because notice it didn't say the road when it said it overcomes it will sit with me in my throne because I'd want to come and sit with my father oh this it's not just something to set out on right it's a revelation at this time you and I have taken a Rapture that our studies of the Book of Revelation we've taken a rapture we went to to complete this to make the throne in heaven complete because it's got to be complete to be able to understand then the fifth chapter and the lamb coming forth because the lamb has to come from the church ages believe and we've got to get to a place to to where we understand some Gods on a man and bring it into the right view all right amen but now you get what I'm saying yes so at this time try to make the division of what you're doing and then when you make the division to see that it is the throne then you can see why the 24 Elders is around about the throne and when see at the time we're going to Rapture 12 of those the apostles is in the throne in a rapture then your scene is changing all right it's changing to a time of work There's No Redemption Redemption will be over because all this Old Testament representation and New Testament representation will be brought into view now there'll be a white Throne that people can receive eternal life but they'll never be the bride and neither will there ever be Israel did you stealing eternal life because of whatever they're doing so all right so now look what we're saying then you can understand what I'm saying since then round about the throne we're 4 and 20 seats and upon the seats I saw Four and Twenty elders all right now go ahead brother Joe Bob brother Bob okay go ahead who's there these brothers are wonderful I appreciate them they swap out to a word that at least some can sit out here sometime because those back in there they they can do the best they can but they they do it brother Joe he's back here all the time because he's handling the other parts of it you know and listen church if you ever have any problems or your family tell them your family and say well if you need me during church time don't let them call your phones and mess things up you know no just tell them to call the church and Joe will answer it and why they come out here and tell you we're not trying to hinder when we say don't turn your phones on we're trying to keep it from Green brain great and mine is the loudest of them all so if mine went off up here you would hear it downstairs easy but listen just called and tell them to call the church and give a message because Joe's are doing it we appreciate all that all right look what we're getting to and brother round what are these 24 elders I'm asking that question see so questions and answers on the Hebrews part 3 57 1006 paragraph 691. now the 420 elders an elder is an overseer a notice they were 12 Patriarchs and Twelve Apostles and they were sitting 12 on one side and 12 on the other well you see the division is the Redemptive plan it doesn't say 24 seats and they're just in a Mingle you've got to deal now with the Old Testament Redemption the New Testament Redemption all right because when you come to the white throne the Redemptive plan is over the 144 000 done been called out sealed in and everything when you come to the white Throne now see that's that's going away on over all right I remember the 20th boilers which were the 12 Patriarchs on one side and the Old Testament The Twelve Apostles on the other side of the New Testament didn't Jesus say will sit on 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel now see that's Luke 22 and 30. but he said that we would sit on the 12th we'll we'll sit on 12 Thrones that's us judging the 12 tribes of Israel because we're going to judge the whole thing amen irregardless of them being representative as a patriarch and a wonderful position you know that they have to be judged all right so we're going to judge the 12 tribes of Israel not 144 000. I'm just personally putting it if we don't set if we don't have to sin before the Judgment 144 000 that are given eternal life here or after we leave I don't believe they'll stand the fight before that either it's the 12 tribes it's not 144 000 because they're giving eternal life here so you don't have anything to be judged that the white Throne all right She'll follow him all right he covers the foundation thing he said 12. is that worship number you see and there's a 20 and 4 would be 24 12 Apostles and 12 Patriarchs they're sitting at the Throne all right so now this is coming to a position to a judgment seat okay a judgment is going to take place so we'll get to learn just a minute but let's just keep reading till we get our number two really matches Revelation chapter 4 part 2 61 101 paragraph three oh seven now we read it or did we read it let's make sure we'll read it in the fourth verse and I saw Four and Twenty Elders sit in clothes in white Rhema and they had on their heads crowns of gold so now this group of people is going to have to have you'll see it a minute we'll get to it without time what means righteousness and because there were ropes show that they were priests or judges Monroe priest judges Prophet so forth see what they were they were White Road the 20 and four Elders there will be 20 and four Elders there will be 12 of them for the 12 tribes of Israel The Twelve Apostles for the church and they said in the courts of the great king remember they're sitting out there these are and here's the Bride In Christ sitting on his throne and his wife sitting by him the church the 20 and 40 Elders 144 000 units of the temple ministering to him where he gets up if life goes with him oh my through that great age that's coming when all the sin and the even the resemblances TNT everything is totally gone go on to the next one number three Revelation chapter 4 which is the message 12 31. this is part one of it all right no that's wrong he said on the throne he wasn't no more back down in the candlesticks now on Earth the Rapture it doesn't come he was in glory sitting on his throne I want you to notice on down we'll find even in the fifth chapter it was not the Throne of Mercy so when you enter the fifth chapter remember there'll be an old Throne of Mercy you'll see that wind at the seals us to Israel we get the revelation of the seal to seals himself deal with Israel it was not the Throne of Mercy it wasn't the Throne of Mercy anymore it was the Throne of judgment it wasn't the throne of grace it's the Throne of judgment Rex verse verse 5 covers this the Throne of judgment because fire and Lightnings and thundering issued for no more merch is over the church age is finished in this filthy let him be filthy still in his righteous blame and righteous deal yes holy let him be holy no more a throne of Mercy so now we're dealing with the split Parts see we're going now to move really and if you technically want to go over you'll go back to 17th it is 17th chapter where the black throne's at somewhere on over it picks up no one asked me after that was my my Thrones and we come back right in the room with that teams would have to be on a little later okay but anyhow the white Throne would be on over there where you could translate way over and see things what's going to happen between here and dire is going to be revealed to where we can see it all right so we see it see this is after the Rapture this is the Judgment seat all right look at number four this is Revelation chapter four part 2 61 101 you talking about throwing up yeah I want you to notice that this was not a throne of grace no more the blood had been gone and the sacrifice was back again and they had been accepted and the blood was off The Mercy Seat it was now judgment seed because Thunders and Lightnings issued out of it is that right remember it was like Mount Sinai when Moses went on Mount Sinai what happened under the lightning even if coward came for a sheep or anyone even touched the mountain it must die and he drops down to here stood Moses up there with the colors of God's flashing Lightnings emeralds around him watch them Commandments to be written and things going down just to show you a judgment seat it was now nothing could stand there before but the redeemed Sinners could not approach it at all it's finished the Judgment seat now he's not saying the redeemed stand before the Judgment seat the redeems that on the judgments then judging the others because that's what the scripture says in First Corinthians 6 and 2 that you even judge angels all right now I like what those kids was doing while ago when they're singing and I don't know who come up with that idea or Rachel where the people stood up High Ohio some of you is getting sleepy and oops that's back down snow but think about it this is a hard message maybe to try to bring because your mind is in a thought a thought pattern me and it must be brought to a change of that thought pattern but once you see it then you'll easily see the seals is not to Israel I mean to the bride the Revelation is to the bride if we go up and run what would be your thoughts all right that's not covered while ago would you say or this morning I really was yeah but you say look Revelation 10 7. wonderful that's God going to Israel and that's John looking back and seeing another Prophet with the sale of church AIDS can reveal the word amen well you better go down to Revelations 10 1. you don't hear that preach them run around and said Revelation 10 1 was the same as Revelations 1 13. which is right for them come on Folger all I've ever tried to do is just get us to see our day I don't know where we're going to the combat base we may have one message but everybody agrees that the first combat beats the line was God Among the people oh God among good people amen man God Among the people Eagle Run Around I swear the couple and you go riding down the road and you look at people's houses that are not even Christians and they got Eagles on them my sister in the age right that's right flying high going into the skies interplanatory travel yeah right right we see church just trying to stay with me and what I'm saying if we're going to judge Angels it's not before the rapture we don't judge here on Earth all right where commanded not to judge here we wait until judgment is needed out at a correct time but you see where we're at look at number five let's give you a short point just to let you see the prophet saying it the church age book page 279 she could never be in the Judgment because sin cannot be imputed to her Romans 4 8. see we don't go to the white throne we don't cover that in a message two or three weeks ago we don't have to go to the white room we miss the tribulation we missed away from them as soon as the man to whom the Lord will not imbue sin but indeed she shall be with him in his throne of judgment judging the world and even angels she's going to be with you good now going down to the next see we're going to be watch who this comes to this is the 70 weeks of Daniel 61 806 paragraph 162. what's the filter that's the sleeping virgins and then they comes up for the Judgment way over a year we'll get that on another bath when we continue this one over where she comes up to the white Throne of judgment now the foolish virgin nothing and has to be judged by the redeemed that's right right amen until we can preach weeks on the Judgment seat but you want to understand the right not to not just go before because you don't say it you know she sits on the Judgment seat with him if we believe the Rapture puts a throne back to the correct order why wouldn't you believe that when you go to the judgment you would never see him without hurt that's a wonderful thing who are these let's just take a couple of quotes and then we'll get to a call go ahead with number seven Revelation chapter 4 part 2 61 101 paragraph 286. now the 20 and four elders I want you to notice they were not Angelic beings angels are not associated Heavenly beings are not associated with crowns and Thrones if you reach out a verse 4 with our its covers that they will be given you'll have white robe and they will have crowns did you read it Revelations 4 . and I saw 420 Elders sitting clothed in white Rhema which is the righteousness of the Saints and bread on their heads crowns of gold okay be Heavenly beings are not associated with crowns and Thrones see they were never Associated they're Angels they never did overcome if you notice a little later on the songs that they sang no that's not the bride this sings the song of redemption over later but you'll pick her up in Revelation 5 in heaven she can sing but then the others when it goes on over there'll be a time Israel is taken over things are happening what only they sing with they sang the song of redemption so Angels don't need to be redeemed see they're all right but they are were redeemed men go ahead and get the license Glory through it number eight Revelation chapter 4 part 3 61 108 paragraph 74. and we found out that these were elders and the Elder is never applied to an angel or a being it is a redeemed human being Elders because they throngs crowns and dominions is never referred to to Angels but the crowns and Thrones so forth pertain to human beings and these Elders were crowned and clothed and sitting on Thrones we found that they were found them over other parts of the scripture that they were the 12 apostles and they were the 12 Patriarchs 20 and four of them which means 24 12 Apostles 12 Patriarchs all right now so when you come to the Judgment of the white room those 12 Patriarchs can sit there but they don't sit in our Park they run around and emphasize if you'll notice 12 on one side and 12 on the other you didn't mingle them together he didn't say 24 elders he said 12 on one side 12 on the other he's dividing the Redemptive plan see we go up in a rapture Israel don't go up it's just time for them to get their Redemption all right but when you reach this position then you've reached the position of understanding that they can sit there around the Throne of God and brother random we just read there he said they said on Trump they said on the 12 apostles the 12th Patriots you know I used to wonder a statement run around a maid until one day on the disclaimed what the word are you thinking man you know I give myself chewing out sometime but you know over and later in about 21 22 that takes 12 foundations in each one of those foundations got a name written blood runs it's John saw his name you know I wondered how did he see his name you know what I read the Bible they said it was 12 foundations and each one of those foundations you know they're signified by emeralds and Arctic Stones etc etc but in each one of them was a name written you know John Shaw's name so he rejoice when he looked over and saw his name but you know that is over about the last of the book and then he comes back to Earth and tries to tell us about it around said he even heard the Thunder the city couldn't ride it because he was forbidden too when you understand what I'm trying to divide one two and three we are in heaven the throne is completed there's a three and a half year period at least 300 plus Millennium all right there's a thousand three and a half years getting it right between the time that we are at the throne and the Rapture in the white Throne judgment can happen go to life through the millennium could jump that far but here's the secret of what I'm trying to tell you to where you can get it tell them the seals is not to the Bride of Jesus Christ but the revelation of the seals to the bride I don't want to be there the ass brought around and said well well Thessalonians were the man was sitting sitting in Temple Of God joined himself to be as God said does that fulfill the first Hill he said yes and only the only question he got sensible out of all the seal questions and answers now I'm just honest now there were sincere question of whether a woman should wear a pajamas you know or whatever and that was on people's hearts maybe not in that and right there but you know what I'm talking about it it was dark or whether it should be this way or brother random should we baptized father son Holy Ghost I was wearing the questions and answers you know but he had one question and that was the only one related to the seals don't you think he was a Brokenhearted you know what he'd come out and said who knows what he said when he come out on the seventh seal are finishing the sixth because of being a prophet he said it's gone from you and there's no way for you to know it now I'm not quoting I'm quoting brother random see people said but I was sitting there when amen he said it's gone from me but sitting right around the coming of the Lord whatever happens well I kind of think that maybe we might be somewhere around that I said that probably in more about 68 and I surely mean it a whole lot more here you know in 2012 right right I was wanting it to happen then I certainly want it to happen now but get what I'm saying see this right here is a proof of concrete anchor to prove that the seals and after that the bride run around and I read them to you over and over the ride goes up before one not seen the night till 19. and one message emphatically even States 1921 which is actually the the 19th Chapter when the bride comes back riding on white horses with him into the millennium we see people that still haywireless people listening right now but they're just probably cutting their computers off and cutting off today they say that dummy we're over here we're over there what do you mean children well we go up before seal veteran said before Shield was rapture but is that the opening of the forcing because you better remember the fourth seal is the battle of Armageddon and according to my understanding of all the years of studying the prophet the battle of Armageddon is at the end of the three and a half year for the tribulation now if you want to get we'll get right in the book and study from there three and a half years of tribulation the battle of Armageddon is right at the end of it so you know what that put us that put us in the Bible right there at the Battle of armed again that means we've been through the tribulations that's what man's ideas what I'm trying to get you to see the seals is not too much Mr Israel but we read the book and we know the things the Old Testament listen to what I'm saying because it's I'm trying to cried for 40 years to explain the Old Testament is not to you and I am right it was the Israel you pick us up in our gentiles brought in and things but the revelation of what happened in Genesis is given to you and I that's right but you know that really given to Israel we glean from that as the bride of Christ to understand just as far back that away and we don't understand just as far that away what a beautiful thing amen to understand the Plan of Redemption but if you don't get nothing of the message get this point we stopped this morning in a certain spot reviewed a little bit showing that we're in the Rapture now this is going to the electrum and we sit with him in the white drone judging and The Twelve Apostles is going to be there with the 12 Patriarchs is going to be there and those Patriarchs will be dealing with judgment of Israel the 12 apostles will be dealing with the Judgment of the Gentiles so then the Judgment seat will cover everybody we better be sitting on that instead of walking before it amen that's right no longer a throne of Mercy the prophet says Thunders and Lightnings are coming but showing this for a second that's showing that we have crowns and things because when we enter the fifth chapter we're going to read where we are priests and Kings Kings have crowns like on these things he's trying to get a point to you through the next messages now we won't be dealing with the bride on Earth if we see any glimpse of her in between Revelations 4 and 19 it will be in a Heavenly scene right not on the Earth all right now the reason the Rapture comes on the fourth seal is that it is a spiritual condition and we right now are in the greatest battle ever fought right now it's the greatest battle ever found I believe right now in this end time where we're at is the greatest battle that's ever been fought with a human mind I've come down through the message 40 something years now never seen the like at the doctrines that have flown from good Brothers and I'm having to battle that in my mind and say is that right sounds good what is it right it's going on right now the battle of Armageddon spiritually speaking is in your heart and your life right now your brain really because in your heart is God living trying to control the rest right it's a great battle you notice and I do too I'll get to a point and I'll be there and people are following that point and just didn't get to where I want to make that next step they lay out and miss the next service or two folks I didn't preach too long maybe it's time for me to quit but you see I don't understand that I don't understand how you can be so involved and what somebody's saying and they've given you a porterhouse steak and promised you what's above a porterhouse I'm not okay what's that big old word and you say make sure you come back I was preaching one time and brother said going to my office and he said brother Dale I'm leaving the church after 23 years he said I'm leaving I said do yourself a favor he said what I said don't leave this morning well I finish the evening surface I begged you please brother don't preach on something foreign no you don't exactly right you want my answer to read and I knew we didn't know if he knowed he wouldn't have been going out the door but I said you don't know what I'm going to preach on it and I would beg you to come this evening he did I never understood that but you know what it helps me sometimes because then I realized it probably the biggest force of the people didn't get it the ones that stayed maybe someone didn't get it so I said well Lord we just smacked up and start again we're going to go through this again amen right yeah we just back up and start another series somebody that's all for the right benefit I don't know I'm just trying to do what I can do come on music but if you followed what I said today this evening you can see that those seals and the things they happen after we gone because it's going to bring up now listen as I'm finishing I'll review just a tab maybe in a message I don't plan to go next but that 144 000 got to be brought in No Redemption goes to Israel right around said read you see a book he said tonight's Redemption is 144 pounds to Israel all right see the day by the time you get to the white Throne they got to be brought in so it's still a Plan of Redemption wonderful thing let's Stand Together well we got Brothers where's the girls I don't like that where's the girls at you hiding come on girls we bought all these microphones sometimes when we get about seven or eight up here they're gonna have to power up with each other thing off of them but today we got enough microphones to go around I appreciate these kids amen I love to see them want to do something you know all right go ahead what do we got What a Mighty God Amen oh my God baby what is it I ain't gone come on boys foreign the Bride of Jesus Christ there's no mystery that he has withholden from her try he sent it to her to know what's going to happen here then to know what's going to happen how do we leave and to know to know what's going to happen out through eternity they truly have been a blessed people well you got one more before we go ahead okay every night foreign foreign
