[0:01] foreign
[0:09] God bless you this morning
[0:20] we've been looking at Hebrews 11 faith
[0:23] and uh
[0:26] kind of studying this out let's just go
[0:28] to the Lord in prayer before we can dive
[0:29] into our lesson Lord we're so grateful
[0:31] to be able to gather together this
[0:33] morning Lord I pray Lord that you'll
[0:34] bless our gathering we know Lord we've
[0:36] got a promise laying there in your word
[0:38] that where the twos and threes are
[0:39] gathered together you'll be in our midst
[0:41] and we just ask the Lord that you'll
[0:42] Quicken the word that we hear today Lord
[0:44] and we study these things out Lord that
[0:46] you'll help us to give us understanding
[0:48] we pray in your name amen
[0:52] so verse 1 says just to uh
[0:56] remember last time we kind of ran out of
[0:58] time and uh you know sometimes I
[1:00] apologize for going so fast I'm gonna
[1:01] try to slow down a little bit I get I
[1:03] get Speedy like Speedy Gonzalez from The
[1:05] Bugs Bunny and Tweety show
[1:08] but we'll try to just slow down and
[1:10] meditate on on some things
[1:12] um and just kind of back up a little bit
[1:14] now verse one it says now Faith is the
[1:16] substance of things hoped for the
[1:18] evidence of Things Not Seen for by the
[1:20] elders obtained a good report I just
[1:21] want to mention real quick too if you
[1:22] hadn't listened to brother Ryan Sunday's
[1:24] going to listen on on faith you know
[1:26] when we were down there in Nicaragua
[1:28] um I got a chance to just go back and
[1:29] and listen again and catch up and and
[1:31] that I just really appreciate that his
[1:34] little lesson on faith and uh
[1:38] provide the elders obtain a good report
[1:39] through faith we understand that the
[1:41] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[1:43] that things which were seen were not
[1:45] made of things which do appear and in
[1:49] verse 4 it says by faith Abel offered
[1:50] unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
[1:53] Cain by which he obtained witness that
[1:55] he was righteous God testifying of his
[1:57] gifts and by he being dead yet yes yes
[2:00] speaketh now you know we I really really
[2:03] one of the reasons I just kind of wanted
[2:05] to just meditate on each of these things
[2:07] these these little stories is because it
[2:09] really drives the point home of what
[2:11] what is faith and you think about the
[2:13] condition that Abel and Cain and Adam
[2:16] and Eve and all them were in uh even the
[2:19] story about Adam and Eve oh that God
[2:21] told him multiply and replenish the
[2:23] Earth well it wasn't quite revealed how
[2:25] that was going to happen just wait and
[2:28] hold on wait for God to reveal it and if
[2:30] you go on and try to try to force it and
[2:32] try to figure things out then you get
[2:34] everything messed up and see that's
[2:36] exactly the same story that was repeated
[2:37] with Cain he tried to figure it out with
[2:39] his own mental understanding even though
[2:41] he'd been taught by his mother and
[2:42] father and and all the he had like the
[2:45] history and everything but yeah the
[2:48] difference is your Revelation and
[2:50] Revelation is when God comes and and and
[2:52] uh uh as as we'll he he takes the veil
[2:57] off of it and reveals to you the essence
[2:59] of the thing and brother Raymond said in
[3:01] the maniac of godari he said Abel had a
[3:03] revelation we're letting that soak just
[3:05] a minute it was a revelation that Abel
[3:06] had that made him just
[3:08] he had a revelation of the requirement
[3:10] of almighty God and he brought a lamb
[3:13] and that's the only way that you'll ever
[3:15] be able to see Divine Healing the
[3:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll be by
[3:20] Revelation that's the only way you'll
[3:22] really be able to really be able to see
[3:23] uh anything that God wants you to see
[3:27] you know you know even I I think you
[3:30] know sometimes God just wants us to take
[3:32] take the Bible open and just set it down
[3:34] maybe in the evening and just meditate
[3:36] on on these stories like maybe think
[3:39] about how the the devil told his lie and
[3:43] their eyes were open and you you see
[3:46] there's these parallels that God wants
[3:48] to open your eyes and the devil's trying
[3:50] to open your eyes to his to his lies and
[3:52] his his deception but God wants to open
[3:54] your eyes to the truth and you see when
[3:57] when you begin to just sit things and
[3:59] think over just think about it like get
[4:02] up get get a scripture laying there in
[4:03] front of you and just think about what
[4:05] it means and let God begin to speak to
[4:06] you then God will reveal it to you and
[4:09] see there's the the Revelation is
[4:11] something that's um it's the it's the uh
[4:15] like like look at Abel there how how am
[4:17] I going to get back to God
[4:19] and and you can see have all the all the
[4:22] uh the education laying there in black
[4:24] and white on the page that you could
[4:25] read about but the Revelation was what
[4:27] to do what I need is blood is life that
[4:31] I was born wrong and you see when God
[4:33] begins to reveal to you that you were
[4:35] born wrong and you need a redeemer and
[4:37] how to get back it's it's something
[4:39] something that's coming off of the page
[4:41] it's it's something that's alive and
[4:43] real it becomes real to you and that's
[4:46] the only way you'll ever be able to see
[4:47] your Divine Healing your salvation the
[4:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost the Capstone
[4:53] anything that we're talking about the
[4:55] only you you've got to have Revelation
[4:57] and see what I'm getting at is
[4:59] revelation trumps Revelation goes beyond
[5:01] just being taught about something
[5:03] Revelation goes beyond just having
[5:05] having it lay there in black and white
[5:06] where you just kind of know it in your
[5:08] head but Revelation comes the only one
[5:10] that can give Revelation is God himself
[5:14] so what is revelation it's like a like
[5:17] somebody taking a a a a a covering off
[5:20] of a statue brother Randall use that
[5:22] example A lot of times because now now
[5:23] what was obscured now you can see the
[5:27] thing now you see like like Abel there
[5:29] and how am I going to get back well it
[5:32] was obscured Eve how am I gonna how am I
[5:35] gonna uh multiply and replace the Earth
[5:37] it was obscured it was covered over but
[5:40] when the cover is pulled off then you
[5:42] can see the essence of the thing so
[5:44] Revelation is the act of revealing or
[5:46] disclosing the dictionary definition of
[5:48] something God's good disclosure of
[5:51] himself and his will to his creatures
[5:53] you see that's what Revelation is all
[5:55] about that God what what really what is
[5:57] the evidence of the new birth the
[5:59] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[6:01] you what what is the whole thing is God
[6:03] revealing himself to you and revealing
[6:06] as part of that his will and revealing
[6:09] when he as he reveals himself then your
[6:11] part in that so he's revealing you also
[6:13] because you're for so all of it is
[6:16] revealing himself to you
[6:19] so if we go back to uh and in verse 3 it
[6:23] says in process of time it came to pass
[6:25] that came brought to the fruit of the
[6:26] ground and offering unto the Lord and
[6:28] Abel he also brought to the firstlings
[6:29] of his flocking of the fact thereof and
[6:32] the Lord had respect unto Abel and to
[6:34] his offering but in decaying into his
[6:35] offering he had not respect and Cain was
[6:38] very Roth and his countenance failed now
[6:40] you see you you start look open up open
[6:43] up your Bible and just lay it flat on
[6:45] the on the bed at night and just look at
[6:47] those things why think about and I'm
[6:49] trying to encourage you to just meditate
[6:50] get along with God at night and or in
[6:53] the morning and think about these things
[6:55] why did God respect Abel
[6:57] why does God respect me
[7:00] does God respect what I'm doing
[7:03] why did God not respect Cain what's the
[7:06] difference here because Cain was
[7:08] religious Cain was he was coming to
[7:10] church and he was say paying his tithes
[7:13] and and doing all the things that a good
[7:15] church goer was going what would do
[7:16] what's the difference what's the
[7:19] difference and see the difference is
[7:21] revelation
[7:23] the difference is faith and then
[7:26] Brothers said now look at Cain in the
[7:28] Garden of Eden Cain when he come back to
[7:29] Eden he was just as religious as he
[7:31] could be he brought flowers and so forth
[7:34] and put them on the altar he brought the
[7:36] fruits of the field and laid him down he
[7:38] believed in God he worshiped God he
[7:41] sacrificed to God he built a church to
[7:43] God just as religious as he could be and
[7:46] Abel rolled him up a rock and made him a
[7:49] church or worship place
[7:51] see the differences in your heart not by
[7:54] intellectual by by his heart God wants
[7:56] you to Worship in spirit and in truth a
[8:00] quickened revelation of of God of the
[8:03] person of Jesus Christ and his will to
[8:06] you oh you see when you begin in during
[8:07] the Revelation then you know why you're
[8:10] coming to church it becomes more than
[8:13] just kind of going through some works
[8:14] and things so you're you're not just
[8:15] coming to church just to sit there
[8:17] you're you're you're it it's it's
[8:19] something real to you you see God wants
[8:22] us to fall in love with him
[8:24] that's what Revelation is about
[8:28] you see now now um
[8:31] we I'm kind of you know when you study
[8:34] at the message what brother round talked
[8:36] about education he he really hammered on
[8:38] education and Theology and Creeds
[8:40] because that's really what the essence
[8:42] of this story is
[8:44] Cain and Abel sitting there at the feet
[8:46] of Adam and Eve they they learned all
[8:49] about all about what happened in the
[8:51] garden and then leaving with surely
[8:53] surely they told them the stories of
[8:55] them leaving with the blood dripping off
[8:56] of their side and and the uh what
[8:59] happened you know not maybe not all the
[9:02] details and everything but they had a
[9:03] good education about that they they used
[9:06] to there there they used to be able to
[9:09] speak to the wind and the waves and and
[9:10] it would stop and now something happened
[9:12] and Moses down in Egypt he had a good
[9:15] education at his mama's feet where he
[9:17] she told him he was going to be a
[9:18] deliverer and Moses even tried by that
[9:20] edu by his theology he tried to just be
[9:23] a deliverer by killing the Egyptian well
[9:25] I'm gonna be a deliverer but it wouldn't
[9:27] work until God revealed it to him you
[9:29] see see there's a difference between
[9:31] Moses sitting at his mama's feet and
[9:33] Moses at the pillar of fire something
[9:35] changed when he got in front of the
[9:37] pillar of fire when God spoke to him and
[9:39] revealed to him his purpose then there
[9:41] was a difference the children of Israel
[9:43] in the wilderness wondering
[9:44] you know they continuously being
[9:47] preached at you can go into the promised
[9:49] land you can overtake the enemy but yet
[9:51] they didn't believe they didn't enter in
[9:52] by faith only two only two one in a
[9:54] million Paul Paul's ears with gamalia
[9:58] where he said at the feet of gamaya and
[10:00] still he failed to recognize that that
[10:03] all those scripture Those Old Testament
[10:04] scriptures were fulfilled in Jesus
[10:06] Christ see there's the difference
[10:07] between education and Revelation when
[10:10] finally he saw that light and it was and
[10:12] it and then the prophet prayed over him
[10:15] and the scales came over his eye off
[10:16] from his eyes and it was revealed to him
[10:18] all those things that he had been taught
[10:20] he had been educated for a long time but
[10:22] then then the revelations struck and and
[10:25] it was revealed to him just like all the
[10:27] disciples that stayed with Jesus for
[10:29] three and a half years and listened to
[10:30] him preach and preach and preach to them
[10:32] but yet they couldn't answer the
[10:34] question like how how are we supposed to
[10:36] be baptized until the day of Pentecost
[10:39] when Revelations struck and they come
[10:41] out they come out of the upper room
[10:43] preaching that we'll we'll tell you how
[10:45] to get born again because they had a
[10:47] revelation see there's the difference
[10:49] between education and Revelation you see
[10:51] we're not we don't come to church so
[10:53] much to get with education is part of it
[10:55] like maybe even the Sunday School lesson
[10:57] is it good education but when you're
[10:59] sitting here and then just some you
[11:01] begin to meditate on in the quiet of
[11:03] your room and you begin to think on God
[11:04] and some God begins to move and and then
[11:07] to see us not the preacher that's giving
[11:09] you the Revelation but it's God speaking
[11:11] to your heart and opening up something
[11:13] to you and you see see that's what
[11:16] that's the thing that gives you power
[11:17] that's the thing that gives you
[11:19] overcoming Powers when God gives you a
[11:21] revelation like he gave to Abel like he
[11:23] gave to Enoch that allowed him to escape
[11:25] the bonds of the earth like he gave to
[11:27] Rey a Rahab about a revelation that she
[11:29] knew that she had confidence in that
[11:31] little Scarlet thread hung outside her
[11:32] window and that trumped all the
[11:34] education that she might have had by the
[11:36] two spies telling her all the all kind
[11:38] of things about this and that and the
[11:40] history of the tribes going through the
[11:41] Wilderness and all that she knew because
[11:43] God she had a revelation from God and
[11:46] she had confidence in that oh you see
[11:48] you see what that Paul is all all
[11:51] through the book of Hebrews he's been
[11:53] laying a foundation to to get us to a
[11:55] place where we draw trust what God said
[11:57] because he wants us to trust him and
[12:00] when we don't trust what God Said like a
[12:02] bride whether it's married to a man and
[12:04] she goes looking at another man because
[12:06] she lose confidence in her husband
[12:07] that's the problem that's the problem
[12:10] that happened that that started in the
[12:12] Garden of Eden when he even goes to
[12:15] looking at something else and you know
[12:17] we kind of stopped in the last Sunday
[12:18] school lesson we're looking at at
[12:20] serpent seed because there's the pro the
[12:22] problem is is adultery and I really want
[12:24] to I don't know if we'll have time to
[12:25] get into it but I went and I studied out
[12:28] what the what the what the Israelites
[12:31] really believe about serpency and if you
[12:35] if you'll go back in history you'll find
[12:36] out that this ain't just some weird
[12:38] thing that we believe but it's actually
[12:41] what the Israelites believed all the way
[12:43] all the way from the beginning and I've
[12:45] got tons of quotes and things from the
[12:48] uh towel mood and from the um
[12:52] uh ancient all these ancient sources
[12:55] that this is what they believed from the
[12:57] beginning and so God gave us a prophet
[13:00] in this last day to take us back to the
[13:02] original Faith to take us back to what
[13:04] they originally believed to from the
[13:05] beginning
[13:06] now I got off my notes a little bit but
[13:08] that's where I'm going so I I said that
[13:11] to kind of keep everybody awake
[13:15] education education you see you can
[13:17] learn you can learn a lot of books in
[13:19] the Bible you can memorize scripture you
[13:21] can memorize all these stories but you
[13:23] can try to connect all the dots on your
[13:25] own but God when God gives you a
[13:27] revelation is him connecting the dots
[13:30] and putting it together into a perfect
[13:31] understanding you see when you try to
[13:33] when you try to figure it out you miss
[13:35] you miss the goal
[13:37] I'm just gonna
[13:41] look at this now I I I'm just kind of
[13:44] hammering on education he's in in Moses
[13:47] when brother Brown preached on Moses he
[13:49] said more simple you can get
[13:51] the more humble and get away from
[13:53] yourself your own ideas just take God's
[13:55] word for what it's worth and believe it
[13:57] and it's by faith that these things are
[14:00] come not what you can figure out
[14:02] you'll never be able
[14:05] how that that should give us I think it
[14:08] should give us confidence when you start
[14:09] when you stumble over maybe weighty
[14:12] doctrines and things just wait don't
[14:14] don't do like Eve and try to rush into
[14:16] it and try to figure just because you
[14:18] mess it all up and you see you look down
[14:20] through history and you can see so many
[14:22] people that have just got it messed all
[14:23] up because they they tried to hurry and
[14:25] figure it out and boom all that all of a
[14:28] sudden they ran into like a seven
[14:29] Thunder Doctrine where now they got some
[14:31] man that you got to go follow or or
[14:33] um uh you get all stumbled over over a
[14:36] weighty Doctrine and they just can't
[14:38] figure it out so now all of a sudden
[14:39] they're going and preaching politics or
[14:41] preaching on that uh things that don't
[14:43] really matter like dinosaurs and whether
[14:45] or not there were dinosaurs on the ark
[14:47] and uh you know maybe they were but that
[14:49] don't matter you know just you know you
[14:51] you don't don't try to force it and
[14:54] figure it out just wait on the Lord
[14:57] he said there's never been a man on the
[14:59] world on the world no saint nor no one
[15:01] has ever figured God out you can't so
[15:03] don't think that you can do something
[15:05] that they cannot do because that's right
[15:07] you just believe him that's what he
[15:09] wants you to do not try to figure him
[15:11] out just believe him you you see how
[15:13] it's simple simple is that Abel versus
[15:17] Cain Cain trying to have something that
[15:20] looks all polished up and stained glass
[15:22] windows and incense swinging from some
[15:26] thing in the church and gold-plated
[15:27] stuff and that's Cain but Abel is just a
[15:30] little Shepherd on a hillside David a
[15:33] little Shepherd on the hillside that all
[15:34] of his family looked at him and said ah
[15:36] well I wouldn't I wouldn't have known
[15:37] him to be king look at him he ain't
[15:39] nothing but that's what God wants God
[15:41] doesn't want somebody that can just get
[15:42] down
[15:43] it's where you can he can speak to you
[15:46] like like I was saying in the quiet of
[15:49] your
[15:52] s and the quiet of your prayer closet
[15:55] that God can come down and give you a
[15:57] revelation that no man can give you that
[16:00] only God can give you
[16:03] and God's provided a way of
[16:07] approach to Fellowship brother man said
[16:09] I'm not trying to support ignorance
[16:11] but I'm trying to say this that
[16:13] education has it's been one of the
[16:16] greatest hindrance that religion of
[16:17] Christ has ever had people are taken and
[16:20] using their schools of theology to try
[16:22] to educate people for well speaking and
[16:24] how to present themselves and so forth
[16:26] and they go Plumb away from the spirit
[16:29] God is not known by education God is not
[16:32] known by the nomination God is not known
[16:35] by Creed God is known by faith and that
[16:38] alone is by faith are we saved God is
[16:41] known by faith so just get as low as you
[16:45] can
[16:46] get get just real humble like a little
[16:49] child that Jesus said that's the kind of
[16:51] person God wants us to be it's just like
[16:53] a little child they can just take God at
[16:55] his word and wait for him to reveal it
[16:57] trust him and just stay right with the
[17:00] word and not try to force it not try to
[17:02] figure it out not try to jump to some
[17:04] weird conclusion there's been enough
[17:06] weird stuff
[17:09] yeah
[17:10] he said and God hiding himself in
[17:12] Simplicity then revealing himself in the
[17:14] same he said see he done it with his own
[17:16] wisdom Cain he done it by his own
[17:18] thoughts and that's what it is today
[17:20] they do it by their own wisdom by their
[17:22] schooling by their education and ethics
[17:24] that they have learned but Able by
[17:26] Revelation by faith offered unto God a
[17:29] more excellent sacrifice
[17:31] nothing clean about it as far as it
[17:34] looked humanly speaking the little fella
[17:36] and grabbing him by the neck and wrapped
[17:37] a Vine around him like that and pulled
[17:39] him along to his altar there was nothing
[17:41] so beautiful about it laying him up upon
[17:43] the Altar and hacking his little throat
[17:45] with a sharp throat sharp rock until his
[17:47] blood flying all over him him bleeding
[17:50] dying it was a horrible sight see to it
[17:52] it was simple though in Simplicity he
[17:56] know that he was born of his mother and
[17:58] father's blood born in his mother's
[18:00] Blood by his father's blood and it was
[18:03] blood that caused the fall so it was
[18:06] blood that would take it back so he
[18:08] offered unto God a more excellent
[18:10] sacrifice because it was revealed to him
[18:16] let me see excuse me a second I'm gonna
[18:18] jump through some of these
[18:20] try to get to my point so in verse 27
[18:23] and 28 it says so God created man in his
[18:26] own image
[18:27] in the image of God created him male and
[18:30] female created them and God blessed them
[18:32] and God said unto them be fruitful and
[18:34] multiply and replenish the Earth and
[18:36] subdue it now see there's god making a
[18:37] promise he's made a promise to Adam and
[18:40] Eve and see Eve's problem was he didn't
[18:42] just wait just wait for God to come and
[18:44] interpret that promise wait for him to
[18:46] come and fulfill and reveal it what what
[18:48] we're supposed to be doing there's our
[18:50] problem we just failed to wait
[18:53] and in Genesis chapter 2 verse 16 it
[18:55] says in the Lord God commanded the man
[18:57] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[18:59] mayest freely eat but of the tree of the
[19:01] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[19:04] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[19:05] eatst thereof Thou shalt surely die so
[19:09] now we we know the story we've got we've
[19:12] got uh two trees here in the garden and
[19:14] these trees are are people there's two
[19:17] trees and you can eat for well you eat
[19:18] from One Tree you're going to get life
[19:20] you eat from the other tree and you're
[19:22] going to die
[19:24] oh you see you start meditating on this
[19:26] script that's that's my problem here
[19:27] this this right now you start meditating
[19:29] on these things and all these thoughts
[19:31] what does it mean to die what did they
[19:34] die all these things we've got to stay
[19:36] on track but you if you sit there and
[19:38] meditate meditate In the Still of the
[19:40] evening then God will begin to open up
[19:42] these things to you and reveal it to you
[19:45] and when in Genesis Chapter 3 Verse 6
[19:47] when the woman saw that the tree was
[19:49] good for food and it was pleasant to the
[19:51] eyes and a tree to be desired to make
[19:53] one wise she took of the fruit thereof
[19:55] and did eat and gave also unto her
[19:57] husband with her and he did it now I got
[19:59] these little pictures up here because we
[20:00] we know I think most of us here know the
[20:03] true story of this
[20:05] it's it's kind of funny to think of you
[20:07] know how most of the world pictures it
[20:09] like a snake with a little apple but now
[20:12] if you eat an apple it's not gonna an
[20:15] Apple's not gonna open up your eyes
[20:18] and the eyes of them both were open and
[20:21] they knew all of a sudden they knew that
[20:22] they were naked and they sewed fig
[20:24] leaves together and made themselves
[20:26] apron you see it wasn't an apple that
[20:29] they ate
[20:31] brother Ram said in the serpent seed
[20:32] message he said well and see where I'm
[20:34] going with this I'm going to prove to
[20:36] you that this is just not something that
[20:37] that some strange doctrine that just
[20:40] appeared out of nowhere or something he
[20:41] said what was the seed of the serpent
[20:43] adultery you follow it adultery with Eve
[20:46] what happened to that what brought that
[20:48] forth what is it tonight and you know
[20:50] Jeremiah in chapter three it says
[20:51] Jeremiah talking to Israel he said thou
[20:54] has played the Harlot with many lovers
[20:56] now Israel Israel Israel's playing a
[20:59] harlot but she's not doing it natural so
[21:01] we're talking about spiritual adultery
[21:03] to look at something other than the word
[21:05] God's God's made a promise God's proved
[21:09] his promise he come down and proved it
[21:11] and if we if we if we're married to
[21:13] Christ and we start looking at something
[21:15] else it's committing spiritual adultery
[21:18] he said lift up Jeremiah said lift up
[21:20] thine eyes unto the high places and see
[21:22] where thou has not been laying with and
[21:24] the ways has thou set for them as the
[21:26] Arabian in the wilderness and thou has
[21:28] polluted the land with thy whoredoms and
[21:30] with thy wickedness there's Israel
[21:33] supposed to be married to Christ and
[21:34] going off and and and and and and
[21:36] flirting with idolatry and all of those
[21:39] strange gods that after God had brought
[21:41] them through the Wilderness and and yet
[21:43] they're and done all these great things
[21:44] and and yet they're
[21:47] cavorton with with all that stuff
[21:50] so there's spiritual adultery and
[21:52] natural adultery
[21:54] brother I'm saying I just got some
[21:55] quotes here
[21:57] her brother Ryan said some things about
[21:59] spiritual adultery he said that's how
[22:00] adultery is committed spiritually
[22:02] when you know him better by the word of
[22:05] God
[22:05] by the Intercourse of the Mind take in a
[22:08] lie of the devil
[22:10] against the word of God
[22:12] and another place he said taking the
[22:14] Creeds of man out here as a man's Creeds
[22:16] and accepting them instead of the word
[22:18] that's committing spiritual adultery
[22:20] against God
[22:21] and another place he said no
[22:23] denomination could put anything to it
[22:25] for whosoever shall take one word away
[22:27] from it or add one word to it it took
[22:29] away from it you're dead hybrid right
[22:32] there she's back here this testimony in
[22:34] her hands the filthiness of her
[22:36] fornications committing and spiritual
[22:38] spiritual adultery against the very word
[22:40] that she claims to believe
[22:43] see so God God has given us his promises
[22:46] he's given us his word if you deviate
[22:48] off of that you're doing exactly you see
[22:50] oh you see one word off brought death
[22:54] what what will the full restored word
[22:57] that's why God had to give us a prophet
[22:58] to take us back to bring life back to us
[23:02] and naturally said all these things
[23:04] about natural adultery he said let me
[23:06] tell you something sister dear you're
[23:07] going to answer I don't care you might
[23:09] be as pure as a lily you may never
[23:12] actually commit a sin of that type
[23:13] immoral sin in your life but if you
[23:15] dress like that you're going to answer
[23:17] at the Judgment for committing adultery
[23:19] with every man that looked at you the
[23:22] Bible said and walk down the street who
[23:24] is guilty the man no you no sir you are
[23:26] you presented yourself that way
[23:29] another place he said the devil cannot
[23:31] create he perverts what is being created
[23:33] what is an adultery an adultery is the
[23:37] right act perverted what is a lie it's
[23:40] the truth perverted now you see how that
[23:43] goes all the way back to the Garden that
[23:45] God had a plan in place and the devil
[23:47] came and perverted that plan and so to
[23:50] lie and that lie put called put Eve into
[23:53] a place where first she committed
[23:54] spiritual adultery and then it turned
[23:57] into natural adultery because how does
[23:59] adultery start adultery starts by
[24:02] somebody's telling you something that's
[24:03] wrong and you receive that in the womb
[24:06] of your mind first it starts in the womb
[24:09] of your mind and then it progressed in
[24:11] Eve's case to the wound her natural womb
[24:13] it starts with somebody telling you
[24:15] something you say that's a great idea
[24:17] somebody tells you you see you see why
[24:20] there's that that promise in Revelation
[24:22] that if you add something to it or take
[24:24] something to it you're you've got those
[24:25] curses because you you're adding to what
[24:28] you're you're messing up the promise of
[24:30] God
[24:31] to call somebody to to to stray away
[24:34] from God's word
[24:36] so in Genesis chapter verse 14 it says
[24:38] and the Lord God said unto the serpent
[24:40] because thou has done this thou are
[24:42] cursed above all cattle and above every
[24:44] Beach to the field upon my belly that
[24:47] shalt thou go I dust shout though eat
[24:50] all the days of our life and I will put
[24:52] enmity between thee and the woman and
[24:55] between thy seed and her seed it shall
[24:57] bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise
[24:59] his heel
[25:04] now so you can see I just and I'm I'm
[25:08] we're going to sit on this for a while
[25:10] so I know I'm kind of going fast a
[25:11] little bit but it's all right
[25:14] there's two there's two C's there's a
[25:16] seed of Christ a woman see that the the
[25:18] woman's seed and and the serpent seed so
[25:20] the Serpent's got a seed so I now let's
[25:23] back up a second and just see what the
[25:25] Israelites used to say about this now
[25:27] you can read in John chapter 8 that when
[25:30] Jesus was speaking to the to the
[25:32] Israelites he said he told them I speak
[25:34] that which I've seen with my father and
[25:36] you do that which you've seen with your
[25:37] father and they answered and said unto
[25:39] him Abraham is our father see they're
[25:41] going back to their lineology genealogy
[25:43] Jesus saith unto them if you were
[25:46] Abraham's children you would do the
[25:47] works of Abraham but now you seek to
[25:49] kill me a man that hath told you the
[25:50] truth which I have heard of God this did
[25:52] not Abraham you do the works of your
[25:55] father then then said they unto him we
[25:58] be not born of fornication okay now
[26:00] they're talking about their
[26:01] understanding of what happened in the
[26:02] garden we're not born of fornication we
[26:05] didn't come from Cain we have one father
[26:07] even God
[26:09] now if you go back to I I got I found
[26:12] this book online that kind of summarizes
[26:14] what the Jews believe and it's written
[26:15] it's called The Legends of the Jews and
[26:17] it's written by Louis Ginsburg
[26:20] and it says that according to Jewish
[26:22] tradition after the fall of Eve Satan
[26:25] and the guise of the serpent approached
[26:27] her and the fruit of their Union was
[26:29] Cain the ancestor of all the impious
[26:32] generations that were rebellious toward
[26:34] God and Rose up against him Cain's
[26:36] descent from Satan who is the Angel
[26:39] semio was revealed in his seraphic
[26:42] appearance all right so
[26:45] let's keep going
[26:46] and the proto-evangelium of James which
[26:49] is this um there's a lot of these books
[26:51] that were not included in the Bible for
[26:53] different reasons and this is one of
[26:55] them and it says it's this is supposed
[26:58] to be Joseph speaking now you got to
[27:00] take a lot of this stuff with a kind of
[27:02] a grain of salt there there's a reason
[27:04] why they weren't included in the Bible
[27:05] but uh the point that I'm trying to
[27:09] trying to share with you is that this
[27:11] thought process was with the the Jews
[27:13] from Antiquity that of what really
[27:16] happened in the Garden of Eden and so
[27:19] this is supposed to be Joseph speaking
[27:20] Joseph Mary's husband and he said I
[27:23] received her from the Temple of the Lord
[27:24] God as a virgin but I did not watch over
[27:26] her who has preyed upon her so when he
[27:29] found out Mary was pregnant this is what
[27:30] he's supposed to be saying who has done
[27:32] this wicked deed in my home and defiled
[27:34] the virgin that's not the entire history
[27:37] of Adam been summed up in me for just as
[27:40] Adam was singing praise to God when the
[27:43] serpent came and found Eve alone and led
[27:46] her astray so too has this now happened
[27:48] to me so in other words he's saying just
[27:50] like that Eve was or this the serpent
[27:53] got even and impregnated her now this
[27:56] same story is repeating in me because
[27:58] now I found my little my little wife
[28:00] Mary now she's having a child with some
[28:02] other man is what he thought is what
[28:04] what the story is tertullian who is this
[28:07] um uh an author in the in the first
[28:10] around 150 A.D he was a a he wrote a lot
[28:15] of a lot of books on Christianity and
[28:17] things he said you are the speaking of
[28:19] women he said women you are the devil's
[28:21] Gateway you are the unsealer of that
[28:24] forbidden tree
[28:25] and I'm sorry we're gonna have to stop
[28:28] right there
[28:33] thank you
[28:41] foreign
