[17:52] let's pray read our scripture and go
[17:54] right on in to the comments and
[17:57] questions Lord Jesus we thank you for
[18:01] the
[18:02] opportunity to be able to stand before a
[18:06] congregation and to be able to speak
[18:09] about things Lord that we don't know
[18:12] everything we don't claim
[18:14] to but we sure are a whole lot better
[18:16] off than what we used to be because we
[18:19] do have some answers maybe to some of
[18:21] the things and then those things that
[18:25] are unanswerable we'll that'll take care
[18:27] of that later we just ask you to help us
[18:30] and guide each one of us that we may
[18:32] speak about you because you are the one
[18:35] and only one that can answer any
[18:37] question in the mind and hearts of
[18:40] mankind forgive our sins lead us by thy
[18:43] Grace and love and let your light shine
[18:46] in each one of our hearts in Jesus name
[18:49] amen
[18:52] Revelations 1 verse
[18:55] 12 and I turn to see the voice that
[18:57] spake with me and being turned I saw
[18:59] seven golden candlesticks and in the
[19:02] midst of the seven candlesticks one like
[19:04] unto the son of man clothed with a
[19:06] garment down to the foot and G about the
[19:08] PS with a golden girdle his head and his
[19:11] hairs were white like wool as white as
[19:14] snow and his eyes were as a flame of
[19:16] fire and his feet like UND defined Bry
[19:20] as if they burned in a furnace and his
[19:22] voice as the sound of many Waters all
[19:26] right now let's go over to Peter because
[19:28] this will just be more or less a
[19:30] relating to uh all of
[19:34] the point in relation of questions so we
[19:38] wanted to read
[19:39] this second Peter 1 Simon Peter a
[19:42] servant and Apostle Jesus Christ to them
[19:44] that have obtained like Precious Faith
[19:47] with us through the righteousness of God
[19:50] and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and
[19:52] peace be multiplied unto you through the
[19:54] knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord
[19:57] according as his divine power hath given
[20:00] unto us all things that pertain unto
[20:02] life and godliness through the knowledge
[20:04] of him that hath called us to glory and
[20:07] virtue whereby are given unto us
[20:11] exceeding great and precious
[20:13] promises Prophet would be saying what
[20:16] these promises that by these these
[20:19] promises of what he's promised to come
[20:21] you might be partakers of the divine
[20:23] nature having escaped the corruption
[20:25] that is in the world through lust and
[20:27] beside this given all diligence add to
[20:29] your faith virtue and to Virtue
[20:31] knowledge and to knowledge Temperance
[20:33] and to Temperance patience and to
[20:34] patience godliness and to Godliness
[20:37] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[20:40] kindness charity you may be seated the
[20:44] Lord add his Blessing to the reading of
[20:47] the word now we'll just come in a little
[20:50] to line up our
[20:51] thoughts and then we will have open
[20:55] discussion open questions as to the
[21:00] things that we've been talking about and
[21:03] you know I you know me I love questions
[21:07] brother random said one day questions
[21:09] makes a strong Church you know you
[21:12] ponder about that you say well questions
[21:15] makes a strong
[21:17] Church well may I rephrase that without
[21:21] it being any interpretation or thought
[21:24] wrong questions that are answered
[21:29] is what makes a strong church now even
[21:32] questions that are asked does let the
[21:36] pastor or the person know a little bit
[21:39] about what is on the mind of the people
[21:42] all right so then it's uh you know it's
[21:44] to that point all right now we have come
[21:48] to the place in the message of talking
[21:51] about the new birth and what takes place
[21:54] and we're talking about that the new
[21:56] birth is the the birth of the word and
[21:59] the reason that we need to be born again
[22:01] is the fact that Adam and Eve sold us
[22:04] out in the garden and put us into a
[22:07] position driven out of the garden
[22:10] bringing us into a place that we talk
[22:12] about and call Satan's domain which is
[22:15] the world and the things all right then
[22:18] we went through covering that as God saw
[22:21] we needed that well I mean saw that we
[22:24] were coming well he knew it that he
[22:27] would be begin to
[22:29] condescend downward into an Earthly
[22:33] existence if you want to use it in that
[22:35] form coming from the supernatural down
[22:39] into the natural form that we speak of
[22:42] when he came into Earth all right he's
[22:45] done so that we could have the right to
[22:48] the new birth and become uh the children
[22:51] of God everyone must have the new
[22:55] birth that is in the body of Christ
[22:58] you've got to have that to be in the
[22:59] body of Christ all right and remember
[23:03] that it has been the same in every age
[23:06] the New Birth has it's always been the
[23:09] birth of the word no matter what age it
[23:11] was Luther's just shall live by faith it
[23:13] was the birth of the word all right and
[23:16] that the evidence has always been the
[23:19] same for every age all right not the uh
[23:23] you know the doings we may have
[23:26] different thoughts and ideas about about
[23:28] uh some of the things but remember it's
[23:31] got to come back to the point that the
[23:33] evidence is the same in every age
[23:36] because if it's a birth of the word it's
[23:37] a birth of the word in every age and it
[23:39] comes to
[23:41] that the new birth being the birth of
[23:44] the word that is made Alive by the
[23:48] coming of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[23:51] which is the soul of God changed to a
[23:54] form to be able to unite with you and I
[23:58] in our soul to where that our soul could
[24:02] be made Eternal right all right then
[24:07] bringing it to that position then we can
[24:09] start by the opening of the word to be
[24:13] able to climbing upwardly as the word is
[24:16] being revealed to us it will build into
[24:20] those virtues we speak of Faith virtue
[24:23] knowledge Temperance patience will come
[24:25] into being by the opening of the word
[24:28] until it will bring us to a complete
[24:30] birth of the word and that's what this
[24:32] age is to bring each one of the ages had
[24:35] their part all right but this age must
[24:39] come to the fullness of the birth of the
[24:42] word and if Luther was to have the birth
[24:44] of justification wesle sanctification
[24:47] Pentecostal baptism we have to have the
[24:51] birth of the entire word of God to be
[24:55] able to bring us to a place as I was
[24:58] saying this morning if we are waiting
[25:00] for a bus to pull up at least we've come
[25:02] through that line we are getting to the
[25:04] point of bringing the bus into being
[25:06] because we're getting to where that we
[25:08] would be ready for whatever that you
[25:11] would think would be coming or whatever
[25:13] is to take place I have my own thoughts
[25:17] on that and I fully believe that one day
[25:20] when the head and body units that as
[25:23] brother randam would say there'll come
[25:25] such a baptism of the Holy Ghost that'll
[25:27] fill every fiber of our being and take
[25:29] us into Rapture all right so you know
[25:32] I'm looking for something to happen but
[25:34] I'm not sitting still not looking at the
[25:37] things that are being are taking place
[25:41] among us because then we must look at
[25:45] that through that all right where is the
[25:48] revealing then of the word it's not in
[25:50] the head because you know you call it
[25:53] Spirit realm or brain and all of those
[25:56] things it doesn't make no difference
[25:58] the revealing of the word is not aead
[26:01] knowledge if if it was then why would
[26:04] you need where would put knowledge in
[26:05] the pyramid see that's definitely not
[26:08] our knowledge it has to be his knowledge
[26:12] all right so that's the opening of the
[26:15] word I had some quotes this morning like
[26:17] where brother Bram says on the uh
[26:21] perfect Faith he says you become the
[26:24] word as you receive the word all right
[26:28] so if we're talking about building a
[26:31] word
[26:32] body then it was necessary that God send
[26:35] us the word to be able to you know come
[26:40] into that place all right so he's taken
[26:43] care of that sending us the profit of
[26:45] the of the age and letting us come into
[26:48] that being all right now we talked about
[26:53] it ending this morning that when we were
[26:55] born into the world in Satan's domain
[26:58] that the nature of our soul our being
[27:01] that we are was into that Realm Of Satan
[27:05] and it would be that way and it would be
[27:08] pulling us
[27:10] downward no matter what the baby is and
[27:12] how good of a family it's in mama don't
[27:15] lie daddy don't lie no lies around it it
[27:18] still winds up being a
[27:19] liar it's just it's just part of what we
[27:22] are because it's the domain that we're
[27:25] in of Satan the the realm we're
[27:28] in all right that's the undercurrent
[27:31] carrying us down that if we die in that
[27:34] stage that we will just what when death
[27:37] takes a place it's not that you are are
[27:41] going or whatever you're doing you just
[27:43] step out of this
[27:46] body right right you don't have to step
[27:49] into another body you step out of this
[27:51] body all right once you step out of this
[27:53] Physical Realm then you're automatically
[27:57] already that body which is the soul of
[28:01] the individual all right but if you're
[28:04] born again see that's a downward current
[28:07] but if you're born again when you're
[28:10] born again you heard from your
[28:12] theophany you started an upward pulling
[28:16] up going up the stature of a perfect man
[28:19] adding Faith to Virtue to knowledge to
[28:21] temper Place coming to the positive of
[28:25] the word of God Amen this is the only
[28:27] age that can come to that maturity the
[28:31] way that was to be now we believe the
[28:34] disciples had the virtues right but they
[28:38] did not have the headstone that's why
[28:39] your Prophet said it he said it hadn't
[28:41] come yet all
[28:43] right so then it means somewhere in the
[28:45] end time somebody's got to find a
[28:47] reality of what's taking place here it's
[28:50] not what's going to be in heaven we're
[28:53] not doing that it's it's the point of
[28:55] seeing eternal life here
[28:58] as it dwells in a individual by the new
[29:01] birth to make our soul Eternal because
[29:05] it started off as a
[29:07] pattern as to Adam and Eve in that God
[29:11] started that with Adam and Eve in the
[29:13] garden full
[29:16] grown and with eternal Souls right all
[29:19] right because they had eternal life all
[29:22] right then their soul would be called
[29:24] their theophany and brother Ram said e
[29:27] was in Adam in theophany that's right
[29:30] all right said Adam wasn't satisfied or
[29:33] complete when it was when he come into
[29:35] flesh he said because part of his being
[29:38] was still in
[29:39] theophine all right so now get my
[29:44] point they are they entered their
[29:47] theophany it was there that was their
[29:50] soul all right but see then we want to
[29:53] think that our theophany is up under
[29:55] under somewhere and we're here going
[29:57] going through all of this to finally get
[29:59] up to there well Adam and Eve didn't
[30:01] have to come that way
[30:04] right when God breathed eternal life
[30:06] into the nostrils of Adam that was the
[30:09] Genesis 1 126 man right
[30:12] right and it says let us make man all
[30:16] right so whatever image God was
[30:18] in that's the image we're in right
[30:21] whatever image we're in that's the image
[30:23] God was in or you got something wrong
[30:25] with with your terminology all right
[30:29] then as the word is revealed to you and
[30:32] I we go from a part think you know way
[30:37] of speaking from partial realization
[30:40] coming to the perfect
[30:42] realization of that that's being
[30:45] revealed am all right so this was the
[30:47] end time the great day to where that we
[30:51] could see about Redemption the old days
[30:54] we looked at Redemption as going up to
[30:56] heaven you know one of these days we'll
[30:58] be redeemed we'll get out of this world
[31:00] we're going to get us a new body cuz we
[31:02] don't need this and all of that well
[31:04] we've got away from that by the opening
[31:07] of the word are supposed to have all
[31:11] right that would bring us to the
[31:13] position to where that we would realize
[31:17] eternal life here that's what I told you
[31:19] that was the thing that caught me more
[31:22] than anything in the world brother Mo
[31:24] began to tell me about the things I said
[31:26] listen I believe you
[31:28] you've seen the dead rais you've seen
[31:29] the sick heill that's all
[31:31] right now this is the words that I give
[31:34] him I said that's all right I believe
[31:36] you he referred he said you know brother
[31:38] Tatum you know and back then we knew
[31:41] each other in the bases that you know we
[31:44] knew that Tatum family and are wonderful
[31:46] persons and all and he said now he's
[31:49] seen all these things I said well and
[31:51] good I said but I've not I've not seen
[31:55] him so what you're saying to me is
[31:57] wonderful but I I'm not one that could
[32:01] see that and say that I believe he was a
[32:05] prophet but I said you tell
[32:08] me what he taught in the word or from
[32:12] the word you know bringing it and I said
[32:15] I'll know whether he was a prophet or
[32:17] not because I did always believe one
[32:20] thing the word come to the prophet I
[32:22] didn't understand that like we do now
[32:26] but I believe that they spoke in their
[32:28] day as God personal to each one of them
[32:32] I saw that in the Baptist Church I could
[32:34] see and realize those things you know
[32:37] back there all right and see when he
[32:41] said
[32:42] okay we won't deal no more about whether
[32:45] brother random was a prophet or
[32:48] not we'll deal with what he said some of
[32:54] us were discussing something there at
[32:55] lunch and I told him I said you know
[32:58] there's a lot of people believe that
[32:59] brother brandham was the one that come
[33:01] to John on patmas whether you believe
[33:03] that or not that's up to you I ain't
[33:05] going to argue with you but they believe
[33:08] that all right but I said wouldn't it be
[33:11] something for you to walk up to a center
[33:14] out on the
[33:16] street and you're trying to win him to
[33:19] God and you walk out there to him and
[33:22] you
[33:22] say we believe God sent a prophet and
[33:25] he's the one that come to John on Patman
[33:28] what a person don't even know what in
[33:30] the world you're talking
[33:31] about but that's supposed to convert
[33:34] people to the
[33:37] message I know what it convert me to
[33:40] it'd convert me turning around going the
[33:42] other way cuz I think I done run into a
[33:45] bunch of
[33:46] Cs but bring me the
[33:49] word here that's one that I talked two
[33:51] years ago and for a long
[33:55] time we talked about
[33:58] God and not real and what the word
[34:03] said and we got it to the bases I said
[34:05] okay now brother dick what do you
[34:08] believe he said okay I don't believe
[34:10] that anymore about the three person he
[34:12] said I believe that it's three
[34:16] manifestations I said okay I let him
[34:20] talk to
[34:21] me all right then I told him I said okay
[34:25] now if it's three manifestation
[34:28] and not three Gods now no more and not
[34:30] one this now but God do I said what
[34:34] about this water
[34:36] baptism and he said what do you
[34:41] mean because see I didn't know he had
[34:43] been pondering those things in his
[34:45] mind I said what you know he said what
[34:48] do you mean I said well what about the
[34:50] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[34:53] Christ
[34:55] well
[34:58] see I had laid it down to where that if
[35:02] he was going to argue about Father Son
[35:03] and Holy Ghost then he didn't believe in
[35:05] his three manifestation he was still
[35:08] trinitarian so give people the word and
[35:11] then let them come to the other
[35:14] things you know God sent a prophet all
[35:17] these things that's wonderful but give
[35:20] them the word first and let them see
[35:23] what it is because once they see the
[35:25] word being revealed they can't argue
[35:27] about the other things okay we went
[35:31] through covering even how that the
[35:33] opening of the
[35:34] word would bring us as I said from
[35:37] partial realization to perfect we even
[35:39] talked about Ezekiel and how that
[35:42] through the prophit that breathed upon
[35:46] those that were standing there that had
[35:48] the the skin had the the things you know
[35:51] the bones and all but it took the breath
[35:53] to come and how that this end time
[35:56] message
[35:58] then would be the point that it would be
[36:03] that God is using the
[36:06] word to bring
[36:08] us to the place that we're supposed to
[36:11] be and I'm a firm believer that the
[36:14] message of the hour is that word of God
[36:18] that was to be brought that
[36:22] mankind knew of certain
[36:24] things and even the Great Apostle Paul
[36:27] and them that knew of a lot more than we
[36:30] think about
[36:32] us yet still they were left with
[36:35] questions in their
[36:37] mind and could only deal with prophecies
[36:40] and things of future events but you and
[36:43] I are no longer in the day of dealing
[36:46] with
[36:47] prophecies we are in the days when the
[36:51] prophecies are being made
[36:53] manifest right right you go back and
[36:55] listen to the prophecy even in the
[36:58] 50s and then you get a newspaper and
[37:00] read
[37:01] it he'd say it like this he said they're
[37:04] going totally insane out on the
[37:08] streets and then you get in the car and
[37:09] drive down the road you say prophecy
[37:11] fulfilled here comes another one you
[37:13] know cuz everything is going that way
[37:16] all right thank God for the
[37:19] truth that's allowed us to understand
[37:22] the word of the hour you know to bring
[37:25] us to that place
[37:27] to where that God will be able to move
[37:31] Among Us and you say I just don't see
[37:34] anything going on
[37:39] well may I state it this way as I said
[37:42] about a doctor the other day that a
[37:44] doctor friend of mine he said he was
[37:46] asked by the doctor said how can you
[37:48] believe in healing and and you knowing
[37:50] whats you know about medical science he
[37:52] said he turned around to the man and
[37:54] said well how can you believe in medical
[37:55] science' how can you you not believe it
[37:58] you know when your your your medical
[38:00] science teaches you that there's a
[38:03] God because it's showing that you know
[38:06] the the inwards and outwards the making
[38:08] of This human body it was explained well
[38:10] see that's what I'm saying that I
[38:12] believe you say I don't see anything
[38:14] going on why
[38:20] not but you say but but we're just not
[38:22] having the signs and wonders there's
[38:24] none of us supposed to have signs and
[38:26] wonders like brother around him
[38:27] had a nobody ever said anything like
[38:30] that I believe though and I've taught
[38:32] you and believe it that around the world
[38:35] today the ministry of Jesus Christ is in
[38:39] the Bride of Jesus Christ amen now if
[38:42] you tell me that ain't true I'm going to
[38:43] ask you about Hebrews 13:8 right see
[38:46] you're going to make it great here long
[38:48] here great here greater here something
[38:50] wrong you're going to make it I believe
[38:53] even in the days of Martin Luther you go
[38:55] back and study
[38:57] they had great signs and wonders taking
[38:59] place cuz it always been Supernatural
[39:02] where the Supernatural is
[39:04] at no matter what age and see the reason
[39:07] we don't see a lot of things we don't
[39:09] believe it that's right
[39:12] amen right we don't believe in ourselves
[39:15] that's right so right then am I going to
[39:17] blame you because it's and say well I
[39:20] don't see you do like one man said he
[39:22] told this other one one day said you
[39:24] ain't got nothing I ain't got nothing
[39:26] well you know what that'd be two
[39:27] nothings I guess you'd have so the best
[39:30] thing to do on that would just be get
[39:31] out of the way and this was a
[39:34] preacher and he was talking to a
[39:37] preacher so I think them two preachers
[39:39] ought to shut
[39:41] up and sit down and get out of the
[39:45] way cuz I see and believe God is
[39:48] revealing himself and doing things among
[39:52] us and I believe it okay now that gets
[39:55] me to where that I Matt to telling you
[39:58] that I
[39:59] believe the supernatural God is here may
[40:03] I quote your prophet he said outside of
[40:06] the body of Jesus Christ he's here just
[40:10] like he was now you say I don't see that
[40:13] well then you're the one that's
[40:16] blind you're doubting your own words of
[40:19] your Prophet that was said well it's
[40:21] going to happen one of these
[40:23] days well when is that going to
[40:27] be I mean what am I supposed to
[40:31] do you know sit down and
[40:35] wait
[40:37] no we keep on going all right but now
[40:41] let's get into the questions and answers
[40:43] what about you what do you think about
[40:45] the day that we're living in the times
[40:47] and things I've got a couple to uh
[40:50] relate to and I'll read this and a lot
[40:53] of it is comment but I'll read it and
[40:56] try the best to answer that and you get
[40:57] ready and we'll have the the others that
[41:00] are are there all right so the person
[41:04] wrote said this is three thoughts
[41:06] talking about Spirit five senses memory
[41:09] reason conscious affections Etc say your
[41:12] personality consists of both spirit and
[41:15] soul I agree with that because I believe
[41:17] your your spirit displays what's in your
[41:20] soul all right so whatever you use
[41:23] consense of whatever that would would do
[41:25] you're spirit will do from whatever is
[41:28] within sight the only thing I hold with
[41:30] that line is Satan can enter that Spirit
[41:35] until he can make that Spirit be
[41:38] contrary to what is within the soul I
[41:42] believe that now I believe he's got that
[41:44] Inlet to where that he can can do it all
[41:48] right but consisting yes because your
[41:51] spirit displays what's in your soul all
[41:54] right it says separating them sounds
[41:57] like
[41:58] your personality is going back to God
[42:01] well what I saying this morning you know
[42:03] about the things
[42:06] the your personality let's separate that
[42:09] a little bit because my point of what I
[42:12] was talking about this morning was that
[42:15] hey and I've got two
[42:17] hours 5:00
[42:20] okay no
[42:23] but the your personality is is what you
[42:26] are right amen connecting your body your
[42:30] spirit your soul together that is a
[42:33] personality that's a person that's what
[42:35] you are all right all of those things
[42:37] but the spirit who goes back to God
[42:40] would not be the wrong personality no
[42:42] way could you take that back you could
[42:45] count it as the good parts of you and
[42:48] okay that'll be all right as long as
[42:49] you're holding it to the right thoughts
[42:52] because you know what we spend so much
[42:54] talking about the bad thoughts
[42:58] you know what you hear very little said
[43:01] about the good
[43:04] thoughts right that's right how many
[43:07] sits around and say now I had a good
[43:09] thought the no I had a bad thought the
[43:11] other day that's why we oh we talk about
[43:13] the
[43:14] bad some pointing at each other now so
[43:17] they must have talked about these things
[43:18] but all right it is the truth is it why
[43:22] can't we talk about the good
[43:24] thoughts as we were talking last night
[43:26] in the Bible study I believe when we get
[43:28] to heaven we can remember what happened
[43:32] here I mean even the wrong things it
[43:35] would
[43:36] happen but it won't be remembered as
[43:39] wrong
[43:41] things if we remember what happens in
[43:43] this world would not we remember the
[43:46] good and the
[43:48] bad but take away the
[43:51] bad you know let's see can I get the
[43:54] scripture and like a woman having a baby
[43:58] that when the child is born all the
[43:59] things are pass about that right well
[44:03] wouldn't it be that way in heaven that
[44:05] we could remember these things in life
[44:07] and doings and and said you know that
[44:10] was pretty bad then but said now I life
[44:12] about
[44:15] it see that would be your personality
[44:17] that would be your your doings all
[44:22] right then they went on to say that in
[44:25] the genetic C
[44:28] in personalities you know they're passed
[44:31] down through generations and I agree
[44:34] with that you know you see somebody say
[44:37] they're acting just like Grandpa maybe
[44:38] they never seen
[44:40] grandpa but they're acted like them you
[44:43] know because it's just traits and and
[44:46] genetic parts that happen that comes
[44:48] through that way and and certain things
[44:51] are the same way that you'd see it in
[44:54] grandfather say is that based on the
[44:57] spirit or the body or
[45:01] both well it would to me it would be in
[45:03] both because you're connecting together
[45:06] that if I act like Grandpa then my
[45:09] body's got to be involved but a
[45:11] motivated by something else
[45:13] inside and uh you know and and I'm H us
[45:17] to believe one thing your soul being the
[45:20] real you but still that Soul has the uh
[45:26] it is
[45:27] you but you have a nature in
[45:32] ways that wouldn't always be just the
[45:34] body or the spirit it would be the soul
[45:37] because as I tried to teach you through
[45:38] the message that it took 75 years to God
[45:41] get to my soul like it
[45:46] is what would you be if You' have
[45:48] stopped when I was about 40 30 I would
[45:51] have never heard of this
[45:54] message so I'm I believe it still the
[45:56] nature is being made through God's
[45:58] nature but also life
[46:01] itself you know it is learning to do
[46:05] those things all right but see I look at
[46:07] it as you being Body Spirit and soul a
[46:12] person
[46:15] amen my soul is what I really
[46:19] am the spirit that's within me is
[46:23] me and it's manifest
[46:27] me and my body just makes manifest what
[46:31] I am
[46:32] within
[46:34] right so I'm a triun being in to make
[46:39] those manifest and I may in that triun
[46:41] being act like my
[46:45] grandfather because maybe he was in that
[46:47] realm I like to think about my dad in
[46:50] this much I I never knew my dad because
[46:53] he he passed away when I was about some
[46:55] somewhere around 4 years of age and uh I
[46:59] can't remember that I think about
[47:01] brother Bram saying first thing he
[47:02] remember was a vision 18 months old
[47:04] would remember he was a prophet and God
[47:06] had him made that way cuz I I can't
[47:08] remember my daddy and he was I was
[47:10] somewhere in the neighborhood of four
[47:11] years of age see maybe some of you say
[47:14] well I can remember when I was two years
[47:15] old well that's all right I can't the
[47:19] first thing I remember about my after my
[47:21] dad died was leading a horse out in the
[47:24] backyard and pulling it in the holding
[47:26] it and me stoning in a tire that I can
[47:29] remember that and I can remember that
[47:31] Daddy had some chew
[47:33] debaca and I already had the
[47:38] denty but I got a hold of Daddy's CH de
[47:41] backer and I go down to the barn and boy
[47:44] I had me a time as a little
[47:46] boy and about that time it went to go
[47:48] both
[47:50] ways and I can remember crawling back to
[47:53] the house I can remember the only thing
[47:55] I remember in house laying on that bed
[47:57] and looking at everything going
[47:59] around I was a sick little boy but
[48:04] okay now
[48:08] listen I believe that genetic traits are
[48:11] pass
[48:14] down I said something the other day
[48:16] maybe you hadn't
[48:18] considered but why is it that you go so
[48:20] long and you wind up somebody looks like
[48:24] great great great Granda
[48:29] well you know they used to I used to
[48:31] think well that's okay
[48:33] but but you know I got to thinking about
[48:36] if we all come from Adam and
[48:39] Eve you know and I know the Beast and
[48:41] what just
[48:43] point but you know that we'd all have
[48:45] the original
[48:47] DNA do you know that after the flood you
[48:50] only had the DNA of
[48:53] Noah right right sure now you can have
[48:56] the wise coming down from this and the
[48:57] men coming down but get my
[49:00] point a no problem to me to find out
[49:04] that there was somebody back under 10
[49:06] Generations that looked identical to
[49:10] me because that would be just be part of
[49:13] the
[49:15] genetics but I also remember one other
[49:20] thing brother brandham
[49:23] said maybe it was your Gra
[49:26] grandmother something like that now if I
[49:28] get it wrong you said it prayed for you
[49:31] well how did your great grandmother pray
[49:33] for
[49:35] you she was just praying about being a
[49:38] Christian but she was asking God to
[49:40] bless
[49:42] her genealogy you know the offspring
[49:46] that would
[49:48] come we don't think about that do we all
[49:51] right anyhow going
[49:54] on
[49:56] So to that clarify maybe to the person
[49:58] if it don't then they can ask me more
[50:01] questions and uh this one is going to
[50:05] take about 45
[50:08] minutes I don't mean that wrongly
[50:11] now but it says based on what brother
[50:14] brandham
[50:15] said now you got to
[50:19] listen our diagram of the
[50:23] pyramid is wrong
[50:32] being that the seventh the Holy Ghost is
[50:35] the seventh age
[50:41] messenger brother brandham message is
[50:45] the
[50:50] Capstone all right granted the Holy
[50:53] Ghost is revealed
[50:56] revealed Holy Ghost revealed each age
[50:59] message now in other words we believe it
[51:03] but here's something that I believe
[51:05] needs to be thought
[51:09] of we look at the pyramid and we try to
[51:12] figure it
[51:14] out and we get it down and
[51:17] see you want to put Elijah as a
[51:20] messenger to the seventh Church age and
[51:24] all right
[51:25] we believe
[51:28] that we believe that is being
[51:30] truth and I believe the message he
[51:33] brought is The Headstone to the church
[51:34] Capstone
[51:37] whatever because number one remember
[51:39] brother Brown's
[51:41] message was not from 40 or 33 when he
[51:47] would be down there you'd call him under
[51:49] Ohio River 30
[51:51] something up to 63 that wasn't brother
[51:54] Brown's message
[51:58] that was the
[52:00] Bible it was his
[52:03] part or part of his
[52:06] ministry to take
[52:09] up those loose
[52:13] ends and bring it out to where it was
[52:15] supposed to
[52:17] be but Paul and them had already
[52:19] preached the faith of the
[52:21] fathers they had already preached the
[52:23] statute of perfect man they already
[52:25] brought those things that wasn't brother
[52:27] Brown's
[52:29] message I'm trying to lay down a point
[52:31] for you to think of see brother Brown's
[52:33] message begun in the seals his
[52:36] message that's what he says in the
[52:38] Rapture
[52:40] book he said not in the years of
[52:46] preparation but said when he begin to
[52:48] sound his message so now you got to
[52:50] bring brother Brown's message then up
[52:53] from isusa Street
[52:56] and bring it out in the end time but you
[52:59] got to let it tie together with a zeusa
[53:02] street y all right now that's where I
[53:06] got into it years ago trying to explain
[53:09] it and people don't want to listen to
[53:10] you about it but I'll open for you to
[53:13] explain
[53:14] it so then there eight manifestations of
[53:18] God in the seven Church ages amen but
[53:23] there's only seven Messengers
[53:32] amen there's eight manifestations of God
[53:35] right
[53:37] amen but now watch there's only seven
[53:46] ads now I can give you the quote off of
[53:48] that if you like it there's only seven
[53:50] ads there's not eight ads we're not into
[53:53] some strange Doctrine
[53:56] issue we're in a truth
[53:59] amen faith is
[54:02] not an
[54:05] adding faith is a birth that's right
[54:08] amen it doesn't say add
[54:13] Faith the prophet said have faith and be
[54:16] born
[54:17] again and then you add to your faith
[54:21] virtue now is that what we read in the
[54:24] Bible
[54:25] right faith is not faith is a
[54:31] birth right it's the new birth Faith
[54:36] amen all right so if you take that look
[54:38] what you've
[54:39] got faith as being the new birth you add
[54:44] virtue there's one knowledge two
[54:47] Temperance three patience four godl is
[54:50] five brotherly kindness
[54:54] six headstone is
[55:05] seven
[55:07] you
[55:10] okay you bring it the way the prophet
[55:13] talked it seven
[55:18] ads the new birth is not an ad it is the
[55:22] birth
[55:23] itself you have to to how that before
[55:25] you can talk about something being
[55:28] added
[55:30] no and bringing it to the place to
[55:36] understand look what your Prophet had to
[55:39] say all
[55:43] right let me get this over
[55:46] here so go ahead brothers and pull up I
[55:49] gave him a couple of
[55:52] quotes and let's read it
[55:57] from the first seal let's read what your
[56:00] Prophet had to
[56:03] say he said we found in the studies of
[56:06] the
[56:08] scriptures scripture that the messenger
[56:11] to the age come right at the end of the
[56:13] age every
[56:20] time Paul came or come at the end of the
[56:25] age all right now we got Paul down here
[56:30] on the
[56:35] bottom where did he come into being
[56:40] at what it come to the End of the Age
[56:43] end of what
[56:46] age if he come to the End of the Age how
[56:49] did he bring the message to
[56:52] Ephesus well he just come to end of the
[56:54] age and brought it real quick no no no
[56:55] no that that that won't that don't
[56:59] work it come at the End of the Age end
[57:02] of what
[57:04] age if he come at the end of the
[57:07] age as your mind is doing look what you
[57:18] got where did he come at the end of the
[57:22] age well let's let brother brandham say
[57:24] it where we can back up and then you'll
[57:28] understand what he's getting
[57:30] at Paul come at the End of the Age we
[57:33] find out that
[57:35] irenius come at the End of the Age
[57:37] Martin End of the
[57:41] Age right now you're going to tie it
[57:44] together
[57:46] Luther the end of the Catholic
[57:53] age
[57:55] now you going to bring Luther at the end
[57:57] of the
[57:59] age or you going to bring him here and
[58:02] let him bring the message to the age
[58:04] which way you
[58:08] do let's let brother random answer
[58:12] it Wesley at the end of the Lutheran age
[58:23] right
[58:25] okay Pentecost at the End of the
[58:29] Age of sanctification through baptism of
[58:33] the Holy
[58:35] Ghost that requires you to stop and
[58:39] think every messenger come at the end of
[58:42] the
[58:43] age did Brother brandham come at the End
[58:46] of the Age
[58:48] of
[58:50] Wesley or did he come at the End of the
[58:53] Age of Lady OA
[58:58] right which
[59:03] one all right let's let him answer his
[59:06] own
[59:07] question at the End of the Age Pentecost
[59:10] got the end of the age of sanctification
[59:12] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[59:14] and at the end of the Pentecostal age we
[59:16] are supposed to receive end of the
[59:19] Pentecostal
[59:21] age according to the word as God helped
[59:24] me to to show you through here that we
[59:26] are to see receive a messenger that will
[59:29] take all of those loose ends out there
[59:32] and reveal the whole Secret Of God for
[59:35] the
[59:36] rapturing of the
[59:40] church do you believe that was brother
[59:42] bram's
[59:43] Ministry I
[59:45] do that's why I believe he come to the
[59:47] end of the
[59:51] age he come at the end of lady oia not
[59:54] at the begin beginning of Lady
[1:00:00] here so you follow so you can argue
[1:00:03] about the beginnings of where we started
[1:00:05] talking about Paul at the End of the Age
[1:00:06] I ran at the end of the but when brother
[1:00:08] Randon says Luther the end of the
[1:00:11] Catholic
[1:00:12] age now what did he say Wesley at the
[1:00:16] end of the Lutheran age and Pentecost at
[1:00:20] the End of the Age of sanctification and
[1:00:22] it's supposed to be a messenger come
[1:00:24] down here
[1:00:25] at the end of
[1:00:28] Pentecost so you got to get things in
[1:00:30] the correct
[1:00:33] order or you're out of
[1:00:35] line let's read the next one and let him
[1:00:38] answer it this is questions and answers
[1:00:41] on the seals 63 go ahead and pull it
[1:00:45] up you see each one of those ages only
[1:00:48] taking a dip into the Holy Spirit
[1:00:51] justification is the work of the Holy
[1:00:53] Spirit sanctification is the work of the
[1:00:55] Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy
[1:00:57] spirit look that's the reason it took a
[1:00:59] prophetic
[1:01:01] Prophet that wouldn't brother
[1:01:04] brandom you say how do you know cuz he
[1:01:06] said it
[1:01:08] wasn't all
[1:01:10] right that's the reason it took a
[1:01:12] prophetic Prophet to come down no
[1:01:14] Messenger to the
[1:01:15] age right what because the Holy Ghost
[1:01:19] came himself in his fullness of the
[1:01:22] baptism right
[1:01:26] now that makes me sick when I remember
[1:01:29] how people Tau about Pentecost as being
[1:01:32] false and Pentecost is not being real
[1:01:35] I'm talking about zeusa
[1:01:36] Street when brother randam said it's the
[1:01:39] baptism it is what the holy ghost coming
[1:01:43] himself in the fullness of the
[1:01:46] baptism but at the end of the ages
[1:01:48] always ends upon the other we find there
[1:01:50] the messenger sent and all these
[1:01:53] Scruples and things to be placed in
[1:01:54] their places like that then the Rapture
[1:01:58] comes to the church
[1:02:00] amen so then there eight manifestations
[1:02:03] of God
[1:02:05] Amen there's only seven Church ages but
[1:02:08] there's only seven manifestation of age
[1:02:13] Messengers because when the Holy Ghost
[1:02:15] came himself on a zeusa street he used
[1:02:18] the oneeyed black man to bring a message
[1:02:21] that's quoting brother
[1:02:22] BR but he's not counted in the
[1:02:29] ages so the drawing is Right amen it's
[1:02:32] just our understanding of the drawing
[1:02:37] right that's messed
[1:02:40] up right because looking at the drawing
[1:02:43] what do we
[1:02:48] see when the day of Pentecost was coming
[1:02:51] to an
[1:02:52] end Paul come comes on the
[1:02:55] scene end of
[1:03:00] Pentecost when Paul's message is going
[1:03:02] out arenus comes on the scene cuz each
[1:03:05] one of them brings a message to the
[1:03:11] age then as the the brother R called it
[1:03:14] the Catholic age coming to an end Martin
[1:03:16] Luther comes on the scene the messenger
[1:03:19] always comes at the end of the age but
[1:03:22] make sure you get it right so Paul
[1:03:24] didn't come right here in the age call
[1:03:27] Paul come into the prior part
[1:03:29] before go to irus Martin go to how can
[1:03:32] you prove it because Luther comes at the
[1:03:34] end of the Catholic G Wesley where did
[1:03:37] he come at the end of Luther's age now
[1:03:40] you cannot put the burst and the time of
[1:03:44] the church age Messengers within what
[1:03:47] you're
[1:03:48] thinking you can't do that anyway
[1:03:51] because some of them were born real
[1:03:53] early some of were born real late of the
[1:03:57] age I'll tell you that in case you want
[1:04:00] to go look up the dates in the times of
[1:04:03] the
[1:04:04] messengers to save you a lot of trouble
[1:04:07] I openly Proclaim that every messenger
[1:04:11] was not to coming down right down at the
[1:04:13] end dead end and
[1:04:16] things but then I openly proclaimed that
[1:04:19] that was the end of the
[1:04:20] age when another messenger steps on the
[1:04:23] scene you've ended your prior
[1:04:27] age so when Luther come on the scene the
[1:04:31] Catholics and all of that it was gone he
[1:04:33] said we know to do a c that's where
[1:04:37] you're wonderful in your
[1:04:40] thinking India would really argue with
[1:04:42] brother brandom when he said the church
[1:04:44] started out as
[1:04:50] Catholic right he said they were the
[1:04:53] original Catholic and he said I'm the
[1:04:56] original Catholic
[1:05:00] amen not
[1:05:03] Roman Catholic means
[1:05:08] Universal but do you understand what I'm
[1:05:10] meaning see then you bring it correctly
[1:05:12] then you got Paul irenius Columbo
[1:05:15] Martin and Columbo Luther Wesley
[1:05:20] Elijah but you got a split part in here
[1:05:25] you've got the holy ghost coming right
[1:05:28] here on isusa Street this holy ghost
[1:05:32] covers all of
[1:05:34] this right that's why it says holy
[1:05:38] spirit brother R said those disciples
[1:05:41] had these virtues but he said he didn't
[1:05:44] have the
[1:05:47] headstone so the disciples was right to
[1:05:50] the place of what Holy
[1:05:53] Spirit
[1:05:54] the Holy Ghost come on the day of of
[1:05:56] zeusa Street in the gifts and the
[1:05:59] Wonders and the things that were
[1:06:00] happening until like we were quoting the
[1:06:02] other night where brother Brown said he
[1:06:05] said die for just a little while after
[1:06:07] that ofus he said they were more ready
[1:06:10] for the Rapture than we are you ever
[1:06:13] heard him say it like that more ready
[1:06:15] than we are what you mean ready than we
[1:06:18] are they all
[1:06:20] trinitarian he was talking about the
[1:06:22] spirit among the people the love the joy
[1:06:27] the things of God the moving of the Holy
[1:06:31] Spirit among the people that were yes
[1:06:38] trinitarians and teaching a trinity and
[1:06:41] God's still coming down and doing great
[1:06:43] wonders and signs among
[1:06:48] them he's not talking
[1:06:51] about the word that's revealed
[1:06:55] because that's what he's covering
[1:06:58] here the messenger comes the end of the
[1:07:01] age to bring the message to the next age
[1:07:05] now watch if you jumped up real quick
[1:07:07] where would you go if you pulled Elijah
[1:07:10] up here trying to connect in there to
[1:07:12] the way that we look at it a lot of time
[1:07:15] what are you
[1:07:17] saying I thought brother R said the
[1:07:20] Elijah of this day is
[1:07:22] who
[1:07:25] I thought he said the Elijah this day is
[1:07:26] the Lord Jesus
[1:07:28] Christ now what is it is it 464 seal
[1:07:31] book what it where it says another great
[1:07:34] prophet which is not talking
[1:07:37] about brother
[1:07:39] brandham ausa Street was the baptism of
[1:07:43] the Holy Ghost the prophet of
[1:07:48] God not the messenger of Malachi
[1:07:51] 4 that was to come at the end of his
[1:07:54] Street the end of lady
[1:07:56] oia because this messenger is to come
[1:07:59] what is the messenger to do he rebukes
[1:08:03] the previous
[1:08:05] age and he brings his message brother
[1:08:08] brandham come to
[1:08:11] rebuke the zeusa street Pentecost
[1:08:14] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian and
[1:08:17] all you don't pay close attention to
[1:08:20] what brother randam was say you know
[1:08:22] that he said
[1:08:24] we know the Baptist is two or three hund
[1:08:26] years back before us right and brother
[1:08:28] randam said one day he said the Baptist
[1:08:31] is just now become a denomination you
[1:08:33] know when they become a denomination
[1:08:35] when they turn him down in his
[1:08:39] message when they turn the message down
[1:08:41] for this age they become a
[1:08:45] denomination how much more is it today
[1:08:48] when the people are turning down the
[1:08:50] message right well you see what I'm
[1:08:53] talking about there only seven
[1:08:56] Messengers men named as seven
[1:08:59] Messengers Paul
[1:09:02] irus stars
[1:09:06] is Paul irus
[1:09:09] Columba Martin Luther Wesley and
[1:09:14] Elijah so the Elijah this day being the
[1:09:16] Lord Jesus Christ when that isusa street
[1:09:19] happened that's why it tees me up for
[1:09:23] people to say
[1:09:24] that they say brother Randon was wrong
[1:09:26] in his early
[1:09:28] Ministry but the son of man comes
[1:09:30] straightened him
[1:09:32] out now I'd like for that to be
[1:09:37] explained it would no son of man come
[1:09:39] and straighten him
[1:09:40] out he was right or the son of man
[1:09:43] wouldn't have come on the
[1:09:46] scene you said well he he didn't know
[1:09:49] about right he didn't know about the
[1:09:50] white horse
[1:09:52] rider
[1:09:54] but neither did anybody
[1:09:56] else neither did anybody in the world
[1:09:58] know about it until the seals broke to
[1:10:01] the prophet even
[1:10:04] though who was it what's his name it
[1:10:08] slip from it uh the one that taught
[1:10:10] white horse rider Lin Clarence Lin
[1:10:13] Clarence Lin taught the white horse
[1:10:14] rider was was the Antichrist way before
[1:10:17] brother
[1:10:18] Brandon but he was no Messenger to the
[1:10:22] age that was the Holy go speaking
[1:10:24] through and working through gifts and
[1:10:27] different
[1:10:28] things but it was not the messenger of
[1:10:30] Malachi
[1:10:32] 4 so you see what I'm talking
[1:10:35] about you got the holy ghost coming
[1:10:38] himself on the de of zeusa
[1:10:42] street but then at the End of the Age
[1:10:44] The Prophet comes on the scene to tie up
[1:10:47] all the loose sins this was the angel
[1:10:49] the star of all things the messenger to
[1:10:53] bring all of the loose ends together and
[1:10:56] tie up bring it together and bring the
[1:10:59] word for the
[1:11:02] Rapture that's why I quote it a lot to
[1:11:05] you he says on the Rapture mess it has
[1:11:07] been spoken now let it come to
[1:11:12] pass if he hadn't said it could it ever
[1:11:15] come to
[1:11:18] pass I don't look at R R's message as an
[1:11:21] addition to the Bible no sir re
[1:11:24] m- it was what the whole Bible was
[1:11:28] talking
[1:11:29] about brought into
[1:11:34] reality we see then you don't have to
[1:11:36] change the drawings
[1:11:38] correct we just change our
[1:11:43] understanding and the key is to see that
[1:11:45] the messenger comes at the end of the
[1:11:51] age but the key to see is the Holy Ghost
[1:11:54] came himself on zusa street that Holy
[1:11:57] Ghost just moved right on over
[1:12:01] into what did he say Smith Wigglesworth
[1:12:04] which one of them died in 24 hours later
[1:12:06] he was on this on the
[1:12:13] field the holy ghost that was in them
[1:12:15] people moved right on through him
[1:12:17] brother Rams had now you ain't going to
[1:12:19] like this I know L other people don't
[1:12:21] like me to talk but brother had the same
[1:12:24] holy ghost that fell on the day of
[1:12:27] Pentecost on theusa Street
[1:12:29] Pentecost I don't have no problem saying
[1:12:32] that the baptism of the Holy Ghost they
[1:12:34] fell on a zeusa street I can quote the
[1:12:37] prophet was exactly like the book of
[1:12:42] Acts now that's what he
[1:12:46] said am exactly like the day of
[1:12:51] Pentecost but now you got to to explain
[1:12:55] that because here you've got the Holy
[1:12:58] Ghost falling on the day of Pentecost in
[1:13:00] the upper room on
[1:13:03] 120 that stood at the faith of the
[1:13:08] fathers you got 3,000 outside just heard
[1:13:11] one
[1:13:12] sermon ain't saying they didn't know
[1:13:14] about a lot of things heard one
[1:13:17] sermon and receive the Holy
[1:13:19] Ghost everybody that gets the baptism of
[1:13:22] the Holy Ghost get the same baptism of
[1:13:24] the Holy Ghost that fell on the day of
[1:13:27] Pentecost or else you didn't get
[1:13:30] it CU that way you can separate it then
[1:13:33] and see that 120 of them was at the
[1:13:36] faith of the fathers but the 3,000 were
[1:13:40] just born
[1:13:43] babies that's why you don't have a noice
[1:13:45] writing the
[1:13:49] word you don't do that you got those
[1:13:53] that had the faith to tell you what the
[1:13:54] faith
[1:13:56] was
[1:13:58] right you see that that's people don't
[1:14:00] consider that point to thing about if
[1:14:02] you say that the Holy Ghost you got is
[1:14:04] the same holy ghost that fell on the day
[1:14:05] of Pentecost I'll say Amen but now make
[1:14:09] sure you're explaining the
[1:14:12] difference in the upper room is 120
[1:14:15] compared to the 3,000 outside because
[1:14:18] there's a vast difference between the
[1:14:22] two it was not those that were out there
[1:14:25] outside that wrote the
[1:14:28] word it was not out of the 3,000 that
[1:14:31] they wrote the
[1:14:32] word it was out of the upper room
[1:14:36] experience and those that they
[1:14:40] taught of their own
[1:14:43] experience Timothy
[1:14:46] wrote I wouldn't say I wouldn't argue
[1:14:49] with you I don't believe Timothy
[1:14:50] probably wouldn't in the upper
[1:14:52] room but he sat under
[1:14:55] Paul and was taught the word of God in
[1:14:58] his
[1:15:00] Clarity and then he knew what to take
[1:15:03] place but you understand what I'm saying
[1:15:06] you don't have to change the pyramid you
[1:15:08] know the doctor you the thought you
[1:15:10] leave it but you get the understanding
[1:15:13] of the Holy Ghost coming at the end of
[1:15:14] the
[1:15:15] eight and right there is where Paul came
[1:15:17] into being right here at the bottom irus
[1:15:21] Martin Columbus
[1:15:24] Luther Wesley Pentecost brother
[1:15:29] brandham to bring us the
[1:15:33] message you ever noticed in the
[1:15:37] Bible that it was
[1:15:40] the prophet's
[1:15:43] words that changed
[1:15:48] things the prophet the message he
[1:15:52] brought opened to
[1:15:56] mankind God for that
[1:15:58] age and that
[1:16:02] time this
[1:16:04] messenger go back and
[1:16:06] study how that the messenger come at the
[1:16:09] end of the age but study it like
[1:16:12] this no Messenger to the
[1:16:15] age the Holy Ghost came
[1:16:19] himself then just let that Holy Ghost
[1:16:21] just come right on over into the prophet
[1:16:25] he had to have the Holy Ghost he was
[1:16:27] born a
[1:16:29] prophet but he had to have the Holy
[1:16:32] Ghost now he was the one that said that
[1:16:35] not
[1:16:37] me did he receive the new
[1:16:40] birth all right go back in the Old
[1:16:43] Testament and study it how that you
[1:16:45] sound a
[1:16:47] trumpet and that trumpet as it
[1:16:51] sounds to the the people might have set
[1:16:54] them free or bound them one of the
[1:16:59] two yeah this message will either set
[1:17:02] you free or it'll bind
[1:17:06] you one of the
[1:17:08] two it will it'll bind you back to your
[1:17:11] old doctr or ideas run you to it or
[1:17:14] it'll set you
[1:17:18] free what do you think about it anybody
[1:17:20] got any comments on what I've said so
[1:17:22] far
[1:17:23] all right oh where Bob Ryan okay brother
[1:17:28] Bob's got the thing back there we
[1:17:34] going got a few comments
[1:17:37] questions first off I want to say I
[1:17:39] really appreciate what you preached
[1:17:40] about the uh Soul and Spirit how that it
[1:17:45] develops and that shed a lot of light on
[1:17:48] that for me because uh I didn't even
[1:17:50] realize it but I always thought that
[1:17:52] when we're born born a natural birth we
[1:17:55] receive a fully developed Soul and
[1:17:57] Spirit and we just kind of grow into it
[1:17:59] and I never really considered that your
[1:18:01] soul and spirit have to develop but that
[1:18:04] actually opened a lot of light on a lot
[1:18:05] of things for me as I dwelt on that for
[1:18:07] the next few weeks after you first
[1:18:08] mentioned
[1:18:09] it and uh I thought of a few things that
[1:18:12] support that and uh Proverbs
[1:18:15] 22:6 train up a child and the way he
[1:18:18] should
[1:18:19] go um that's one of the things I thought
[1:18:22] of it supports what you're saying
[1:18:24] because you know when we're born you
[1:18:27] know at that age like Catholics say give
[1:18:28] us a child until they're five and we'll
[1:18:30] have them you know the rest of their
[1:18:32] life and well unless God intervenes you
[1:18:33] know right but um they as children at
[1:18:38] that age were very very tender and
[1:18:40] fragile and and can really be U you know
[1:18:44] LED one way or another right because of
[1:18:47] that Soul not being developed yet in
[1:18:49] spirit and all brother brandom also said
[1:18:51] after you recognize the very word of God
[1:18:53] was Eagle food you left the other thing
[1:18:57] you have been formed into the living
[1:18:58] image of the Living God you heard from
[1:19:00] your theop exactly and also I I don't
[1:19:04] know if he made this comment but I've
[1:19:05] heard it here a lot and I believe it
[1:19:07] that our theophany is being built around
[1:19:08] our Born Again experience and I wrote
[1:19:11] down here that I conclude then that
[1:19:14] after we are saved God leads us in a
[1:19:16] path that will mold our character and
[1:19:18] thus our soul into that theophan body M
[1:19:22] so you preached the matching pieces
[1:19:24] series also back in 93 I think
[1:19:29] um God is making our soul match our
[1:19:32] theophany would that be right making our
[1:19:35] our soul bring the word yeah so he's
[1:19:38] making it match what he saw in heaven
[1:19:40] he's making what's here match what's
[1:19:41] there exactly and then the scriptures
[1:19:45] also the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:19:46] order of the of the Lord that's another
[1:19:47] one that supports that and all things
[1:19:50] work together for good to them that love
[1:19:51] God m mhm um I had one question about it
[1:19:56] though death only changes our dwelling
[1:19:58] place right right it doesn't change
[1:20:00] anything of what we are so then uh if a
[1:20:04] baby dies the soul is not
[1:20:06] developed what happens to the soul of
[1:20:08] the baby and example as Sharon Rose died
[1:20:11] at about 18 months old brother renom saw
[1:20:13] saw her beyond the curtain of time
[1:20:15] exactly with a developed uh whatever you
[1:20:18] know Soul or whatever and she actually
[1:20:20] knew things and knew where where she was
[1:20:22] and she knew uh she was mentioned
[1:20:24] something about Billy Paul waiting on
[1:20:26] him and all these other things so what
[1:20:28] transitioned her into that developed
[1:20:31] State and she died as a
[1:20:33] baby because she became to the full
[1:20:36] maturity of what she would have would
[1:20:38] have been had she come into the world
[1:20:40] you know and lived uh because you got to
[1:20:42] admit it that way if she did come to it
[1:20:44] that way she would have come to it later
[1:20:46] but God sees that and when he sees that
[1:20:49] see the baby the soul of that baby is
[1:20:53] his
[1:20:54] theophany but then when you change it
[1:20:57] like that and put it as it goes beyond
[1:20:59] the curtain of time remember all babies
[1:21:01] go to
[1:21:02] heaven it it it's that's what I tried to
[1:21:05] emphasize this morning in Wednesday
[1:21:07] night that you know you reach the age of
[1:21:10] accountability then your soul has to
[1:21:13] answer see because until that it's not
[1:21:17] it's under the blood of Jesus Christ so
[1:21:20] when Sharon Rose left this body she went
[1:21:22] straight into what she should have been
[1:21:26] had she come into the natural and been
[1:21:28] and would never baby be that way now
[1:21:32] there is some technical question about
[1:21:35] brother brandom talking when he talks
[1:21:37] about a baby that's ill legitimate he
[1:21:40] said I can't see that's a predestinated
[1:21:41] seed all right I'll go along with him
[1:21:43] because I believe that that was just an
[1:21:45] act of life but the baby goes to heaven
[1:21:48] anyway it don't matter whether it's Mom
[1:21:50] and Daddy's good or bad or whatever it
[1:21:52] is the baby goes to heaven automatically
[1:21:55] all right but see Sharon Rose actually
[1:21:57] could tell brother brandom what was
[1:21:59] going to take
[1:22:00] place so she had entered into a
[1:22:03] situation of her soul that she connected
[1:22:06] to the point of being her theop that's
[1:22:09] what I've tried to explain to you that
[1:22:11] she then was into the position she
[1:22:13] should have
[1:22:15] been but she never attained to that in
[1:22:18] life you know she didn't live that long
[1:22:21] all right had you reached the age of
[1:22:23] accountability then you would have a
[1:22:25] problem with the soul as the baby going
[1:22:29] into uh the position of maybe Sharon
[1:22:33] Rose went I don't put it just because
[1:22:35] Sharon Rose was his
[1:22:36] daughter that that would be you're
[1:22:38] getting a little bit too close to uh
[1:22:40] trying to make everything work out that
[1:22:42] way I I'd rather stay with the point
[1:22:44] that all babies go to heaven and that
[1:22:47] she was in that form at 18 months old
[1:22:49] that she knew no sin no situation no
[1:22:53] regards whatsoever so she would step
[1:22:55] right into where she should have been to
[1:22:56] start
[1:22:58] with because that would be her her
[1:23:01] doings and that would be her theophany
[1:23:02] which is her
[1:23:05] soul she went to the real you her
[1:23:08] soul and when he saw her she was 18 20
[1:23:11] years old you know she
[1:23:14] wasn't and she never reach that in life
[1:23:18] so it's not based upon what we reach in
[1:23:20] life it's What God Says about
[1:23:23] it all right okay and then
[1:23:27] U all right one thing I Stumble at is
[1:23:31] when I hear people say that uh I was
[1:23:33] born again on a certain day I know you
[1:23:35] came in the message and studied for two
[1:23:37] years and then I believe your story is
[1:23:39] that you and sister Peggy received the
[1:23:41] baptism Holy Spirit at the same time you
[1:23:43] fell one way and she fell the other
[1:23:45] brother Wade I think has a date on the
[1:23:46] calendar Brother Gary Atkins has a you
[1:23:49] know a battle of I20 right I don't have
[1:23:52] any of those red letter dates I've been
[1:23:54] being born again since uh well basically
[1:23:57] since I was a child I've been receiving
[1:23:59] the understanding of the truth and then
[1:24:01] around the age of accountability was uh
[1:24:04] convicted and and and got saved as the
[1:24:07] Baptist call it which was justification
[1:24:09] and then came into more light much more
[1:24:11] light in the message and since then I've
[1:24:13] been continually being born again I've
[1:24:15] never stopped right but I don't have a
[1:24:17] red letter date on the calendar I can
[1:24:19] point to and say it happened on this day
[1:24:20] does everybody need a date
[1:24:24] I believe you need the
[1:24:26] experience but remember the definition
[1:24:28] of an experience is something you live
[1:24:30] through it could be over a long period
[1:24:32] of time see I I admit that I or say that
[1:24:36] I was I repented I done everything I
[1:24:38] could do back there in the in the years
[1:24:41] in the Baptist for that time and then I
[1:24:43] come into the message but I don't credit
[1:24:45] it as saying I come into the message
[1:24:47] meant that I was born
[1:24:49] again I did go on to a place to have an
[1:24:53] experience that I can anchor that to and
[1:24:56] I believe everybody needs something to
[1:24:58] Anchor it to amen you know I'm not
[1:25:01] saying for you to to uh deny the Holy
[1:25:05] Ghost and say you didn't have it I've
[1:25:07] never taught anybody that way I believe
[1:25:09] you need to keep confessing it until you
[1:25:12] will walk into it that's just like me
[1:25:14] brother randam said if you'll stay under
[1:25:16] the spout long enough you'll come forth
[1:25:18] speaking in tongues right but you know
[1:25:21] I've never spoken
[1:25:25] AR you going to say that I'm not saved
[1:25:30] no that wouldn't be the sign of the
[1:25:33] Wonder the sign of the Wonder is the
[1:25:36] birth of the word all right now to have
[1:25:41] the Holy Ghost and have a problem may I
[1:25:44] quote R random his daughter in law uh
[1:25:48] receive the Holy Ghost one
[1:25:50] night right he said it and the next
[1:25:54] night she was doubting
[1:25:58] it you
[1:26:00] see do you remember the man that uh
[1:26:03] found a little paper you know and what
[1:26:06] will you do and or whatever it was on
[1:26:08] the paper and he started searching and
[1:26:10] going everywhere and and and trying to
[1:26:13] get people to pray for him to be saved
[1:26:15] he went to Brother around him and he
[1:26:17] said you got it when you read
[1:26:21] that think about that so when you read
[1:26:24] that said you made a decision
[1:26:28] right or you thought about it at least
[1:26:31] you know we'll call it
[1:26:32] that and see then that way God can can
[1:26:35] give you the new
[1:26:37] birth without having some kind of an
[1:26:39] outward experience or emotions because
[1:26:42] that's what he said is to receive the
[1:26:43] Holy Ghost without a sensation now I've
[1:26:46] always said and believe in it that
[1:26:48] everybody that's ever born again has an
[1:26:51] experience and maybe your experience is
[1:26:53] living through a long period of time but
[1:26:56] one of these days you'll go back and
[1:26:59] you'll remember where you got started at
[1:27:01] maybe and something will trigger from
[1:27:04] that to be able to tie together but
[1:27:07] until that time I'm just honest as it
[1:27:09] can be keep seeking God that's right I
[1:27:12] don't see where there's any problem with
[1:27:14] seeking God after you get the new birth
[1:27:17] I thought that was what it was supposed
[1:27:20] to be amen don't ever stop praying for
[1:27:23] God to fill you with his love and
[1:27:26] understanding to give you a new
[1:27:28] birth to birth the word that you've
[1:27:32] heard but remember then the new birth is
[1:27:35] what a revelation of Jesus
[1:27:39] Christ and see somewhere you'll tie it
[1:27:41] to that of saying well there where I got
[1:27:46] started I got started right there in a
[1:27:50] Baptist Church at an altar
[1:27:54] and see I'm just a different type of
[1:27:56] person see from most everybody most
[1:27:58] everybody would say well you said you
[1:28:00] saw the Lord or something when you 12 11
[1:28:04] 12 years old that's right I did I
[1:28:06] believe
[1:28:07] it but when I came on to this message
[1:28:12] that became alive to me of what I had
[1:28:14] really
[1:28:15] seen and all I wanted was to make sure I
[1:28:20] keep praying every day Lord feel me with
[1:28:22] your
[1:28:23] love give me an anchor in my soul I
[1:28:28] believe that I'm born again but keep on
[1:28:30] revealing yourself cuz if you do I know
[1:28:33] I'm born
[1:28:35] again I'm not going to tell anybody that
[1:28:37] you're not born again I'm going to just
[1:28:40] tell you don't stop seeking God all
[1:28:43] right then if you get upset with me
[1:28:45] because I'm telling you to don't seek
[1:28:47] God you know what I'm going to tell you
[1:28:49] you didn't get born
[1:28:50] again okay does that offend you I'm
[1:28:53] going to tell you if you say well i' I'm
[1:28:56] blessed God I got saved on December the
[1:28:59] 14th right there and I there and you get
[1:29:02] mad at me about it because I've stirred
[1:29:04] you a little bit you didn't get born
[1:29:06] again that day that's right you're
[1:29:08] proving it so it's not me telling you
[1:29:11] you're not born again right it's like I
[1:29:14] told a brother that left here that time
[1:29:16] he told everybody said brother Dale said
[1:29:17] I wasn't saved I wasn't born again I
[1:29:19] never did I said said I'm telling you
[1:29:24] your
[1:29:25] actions the way you're acting is not a
[1:29:28] Christian
[1:29:31] right and I don't believe that's a
[1:29:33] Christian acting like
[1:29:35] that he went away telling everybody I
[1:29:38] said I wouldn't he wouldn't I didn't I
[1:29:40] said you're acting that way that's your
[1:29:45] choice because the birth to each
[1:29:47] individual is a birth
[1:29:50] yes
[1:29:52] but don't ever stop seeking
[1:29:56] God if there's anything that ever stuck
[1:29:58] into my mind is brother random when he
[1:30:00] would
[1:30:03] pray he would
[1:30:05] pray like he was the worst person in the
[1:30:10] world the worst sinner could ever be
[1:30:12] thought
[1:30:13] of and said Lord I Thank you for saving
[1:30:17] me and Lord just fill me with your love
[1:30:26] you see you can get to New Birth without
[1:30:28] really having a great knowledge about it
[1:30:31] that's my
[1:30:32] point but somewhere one day you'll
[1:30:34] connect back to that and
[1:30:40] you'll and you'll see hey that was where
[1:30:44] I started
[1:30:46] at any more yeah um I agree with you on
[1:30:50] that there was one time in my experience
[1:30:52] since a Baptist kid that I can think of
[1:30:55] that I did stop and about that time and
[1:30:57] that was in the Baptist Church God put
[1:30:58] in my mind a question about how do I
[1:31:00] know that I'm right and how do I know
[1:31:03] that I'm in the right denomination
[1:31:04] because I prayed one time and said
[1:31:06] father thank you for letting me be born
[1:31:07] in the right denomination and I based
[1:31:10] that simply on the fact that I knew that
[1:31:11] he knew that I loved him and wanted the
[1:31:13] truth so I thought he wouldn't be let me
[1:31:16] wouldn't let me be born in the wrong one
[1:31:17] because I know we weren't all right all
[1:31:19] believe in different things but about
[1:31:22] that time God put the question in my
[1:31:23] mind how do you know you're right and
[1:31:25] that's when I was around 15 or 16 years
[1:31:27] old and then I was 17 when I came to the
[1:31:29] message so um one other one other
[1:31:33] question or comment slash question about
[1:31:36] the soul developing you you preached a
[1:31:39] while back years ago I guess that
[1:31:41] Jesus God came down in his son Jesus and
[1:31:45] in a limited form he was limited to the
[1:31:47] extent that he couldn't see the sin of
[1:31:49] those around him or have to kill them
[1:31:50] right because sin can cannot dwell in
[1:31:52] the presence of God so then I would say
[1:31:55] then too that would it be I guess it'd
[1:31:57] be right to say that Jesus when he was
[1:31:59] born being that he was our Kinsman he
[1:32:02] came also with a limited or a
[1:32:04] underdeveloped I guess you could say
[1:32:05] spirit and soul and had to develop
[1:32:07] because he grew in Grace and knowledge I
[1:32:09] supposed to say he grew in Grace and
[1:32:10] knowledge and he had to do that to
[1:32:12] suffer as we suffered and to be tempted
[1:32:14] in all points as we were tempted I mean
[1:32:17] that's profound to think that God could
[1:32:18] limit himself to that extent to where he
[1:32:21] could be
[1:32:23] uh limited and so so much to where he
[1:32:25] had to develop in his spirit and soul so
[1:32:27] then God I guess you could say you know
[1:32:30] Elohim LED his son along paths in life
[1:32:34] through Temptations and everything to
[1:32:36] develop that soul to what it needed to
[1:32:38] be
[1:32:39] right yeah because see if if he grew in
[1:32:42] Grace and knowledge then there has to be
[1:32:44] a point that something about him could
[1:32:45] grow but like you're saying to me that
[1:32:48] the limit was the fact of him being in
[1:32:50] human flesh we don't think about us
[1:32:53] being that that limit that's that limits
[1:32:55] us as being in human flesh it's pretty
[1:32:58] easy sometime in that Spirit realm to
[1:33:00] see things and real good and all but
[1:33:02] then all at once that human being starts
[1:33:05] rising up the body and it doesn't work
[1:33:08] too good you know but that's he grew in
[1:33:13] Grace and
[1:33:14] knowledge he was almighty God yeah but
[1:33:18] remember by being in flesh is what limit
[1:33:23] him it wasn't spirit and soul limitation
[1:33:27] it was by being in
[1:33:29] flesh because it's hard to bring this
[1:33:31] flesh into being that's right you know
[1:33:35] you can say all you want to you say well
[1:33:37] I it's easy no it's not it's hard to
[1:33:40] bring the flesh into
[1:33:41] being you can say Well it my spirit
[1:33:43] that's not into being well just remember
[1:33:46] your spirit and flesh can't be separated
[1:33:47] a whole lot you got you got to deal with
[1:33:50] that anything else that's all
[1:33:55] okay anybody else any comments up to
[1:33:58] where we
[1:34:03] are anybody with any other question I
[1:34:05] got one more part on here but anybody
[1:34:08] with any
[1:34:10] thoughts any questions or thoughts
[1:34:16] comments Oh Sister Trudy excuse
[1:34:19] me yeah
[1:34:25] just today I I got the Revelation to me
[1:34:30] uh death just helps us step out of this
[1:34:34] worldly
[1:34:35] costume it's just like stepping out of a
[1:34:38] garment and going into another another
[1:34:41] realm you know it's beautiful that way
[1:34:44] yeah and there's no fear there that's
[1:34:47] right got to
[1:34:49] remember Revelation is always in in the
[1:34:52] heavenlies
[1:34:54] right so then Revelation is trying to
[1:34:57] pull us into another
[1:35:00] realm right and that's the're doing
[1:35:03] anything else no not right now anybody
[1:35:06] else any
[1:35:07] comments
[1:35:13] thoughts I have one more here that's
[1:35:15] kind of a we'll cover it in a rim but uh
[1:35:19] to the person that asked the question
[1:35:20] now don't think that I'm correcting your
[1:35:23] thoughts but I have to correct your
[1:35:25] thoughts to answer it in the right order
[1:35:28] okay all right that's a good way of
[1:35:31] getting by with it I
[1:35:33] guess but not against anybody It's just
[1:35:36] sometimes we word something that maybe
[1:35:39] in your Bible that's laying in front of
[1:35:41] you it says something but in my Bible
[1:35:44] it's laying here it's got a different
[1:35:46] word so then you know I'm I'm saying it
[1:35:50] that way the best I I can cuz says when
[1:35:53] we're born again we're sitting with
[1:35:55] Christ in Heavenly
[1:35:56] places and I agree that's right Heavenly
[1:35:59] places now watch not
[1:36:02] heaven when you're born again you don't
[1:36:05] go to
[1:36:06] heaven you're resurrected sitting in
[1:36:09] Heavenly places in Christ Jes in Christ
[1:36:11] Jesus you're not going to
[1:36:14] heaven that's that's still above that's
[1:36:16] going to take a change a Rapture to take
[1:36:19] us there and that word
[1:36:21] comes from Heavenly in that one is 2032
[1:36:25] which means like Heavenly Realms I
[1:36:27] looked this up to me but the person put
[1:36:29] it this way when this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:36:32] be dissolved which was going with
[1:36:35] Corinthians we have one waiting in the
[1:36:39] heavenlies right not heaven all right
[1:36:41] now I agree with the
[1:36:43] statement
[1:36:45] okay like we're resurrected sitting in
[1:36:47] Heavenly places we're not in
[1:36:50] heaven all all right I agree with when
[1:36:52] the Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we
[1:36:54] have one waiting in the heavens it's not
[1:36:58] in heaven it's right here in
[1:37:02] us we just step over into heaven when we
[1:37:06] drop this robe of Flesh we step right
[1:37:09] into heaven but what I say in that
[1:37:11] numbers 3272 which means Heaven the one
[1:37:15] in Corinthians I said I wasn't trying to
[1:37:18] correct the point I was correcting the
[1:37:19] word when you you use the word Heaven it
[1:37:22] says Heavens in Corinthians it doesn't
[1:37:25] say heavenlies but now maybe your Bible
[1:37:27] says
[1:37:28] heavenlies M says Heaven all looks like
[1:37:32] the same real in both instances I
[1:37:36] agree when you're born again not your
[1:37:40] body not your
[1:37:42] spirit but your soul is brought into
[1:37:45] eternal
[1:37:46] life right and that is Heavenly places
[1:37:50] in Christ Jes Jesus right while I'm
[1:37:53] living here now I can be so
[1:37:56] happy I can be to the point of saying
[1:37:59] wonderful for to be able Lord that you
[1:38:02] allowed me to see your word I'm in
[1:38:05] Heavenly
[1:38:07] places even when he's not revealing it
[1:38:10] to me I love to
[1:38:12] read I love to read the word of God even
[1:38:16] when he's not revealing it now you know
[1:38:18] what I mean by that how many of you
[1:38:21] would agree that you read a lot of times
[1:38:23] and didn't get nothing as we call it you
[1:38:26] know I mean you read and you read and
[1:38:28] you read and you say I I just didn't get
[1:38:31] anything Lord from that and then the
[1:38:33] next day you pick read the same
[1:38:35] scripture it's not something different
[1:38:37] to get but that scripture opens
[1:38:40] up to you now you're in Heavenly places
[1:38:44] in Christ Jesus you a changed the word
[1:38:47] at all you ain't changed your place that
[1:38:49] you're in you just just been taken out
[1:38:51] of this natural carnal mind into a
[1:38:54] Supernatural part of
[1:38:57] doings mean because that's the moving of
[1:39:00] the individual see that's the way I see
[1:39:03] and believe that your soul is your
[1:39:04] theophany and the minute you die it's
[1:39:08] not over there but the second you die
[1:39:10] you're over
[1:39:13] there it's right here within
[1:39:15] you brother said the soul no matter what
[1:39:19] condition it's in
[1:39:23] death just takes it to its
[1:39:28] Destiny we shouldn't even fear
[1:39:31] death because death is an ability to
[1:39:33] move from this uh house past
[1:39:37] house into a wonderful
[1:39:41] situation but that's all that I've ever
[1:39:44] tried to preach for all of these years
[1:39:46] is that Soul because this goes all the
[1:39:48] way back into
[1:39:50] the mid 70s at least or in there earlier
[1:39:55] 1969 in Athens Georgia I was preaching
[1:39:58] that the Bride of Jesus Christ would be
[1:40:01] the son of
[1:40:02] man in the last
[1:40:06] days so you know what I believed
[1:40:09] it because that was what I was preaching
[1:40:12] you see death just removes us from this
[1:40:15] situation to another
[1:40:18] situation it's not not over the
[1:40:22] until this one dissolves that's what the
[1:40:24] scripture said if this Earthly
[1:40:27] paracle were
[1:40:31] dissolved it's not over there until this
[1:40:33] is dissolved who this Mell check we have
[1:40:36] not the bodies yes all right but we're
[1:40:40] being built here into the image of that
[1:40:42] and that's where it was mentioned about
[1:40:45] that yeah I've always tried to teach you
[1:40:47] what when how many years ago was that
[1:40:49] matching pieces probably 1995 okay 1995
[1:40:54] I was preaching mashing pieces and my
[1:40:58] point was the same as of today when
[1:41:00] Martin Luther there was no way that man
[1:41:03] could die there was nothing could happen
[1:41:05] to him because he wouldn't match in what
[1:41:08] was in
[1:41:10] heaven but the minute the man reached
[1:41:13] that message and saw that the just shall
[1:41:16] live by faith Heavenly
[1:41:18] places in Christ Jesus in him upon Earth
[1:41:22] matched him to what was in heaven now
[1:41:26] he's going you know he had to go from in
[1:41:29] home but the only difference is
[1:41:31] somebody's going to get it
[1:41:34] here because the matching pieces is
[1:41:36] coming
[1:41:38] here I want everything brought here you
[1:41:41] may want to go up that's all right we
[1:41:44] may be talking about the same thing but
[1:41:46] that's just me and my carnality all
[1:41:49] right I don't want to go to heaven
[1:41:51] heav I want God to come here to take me
[1:41:56] there then everything will be in great
[1:42:00] shape and that'll be your matching
[1:42:03] pieces when it matches here on Earth
[1:42:06] what you are in heaven that the word
[1:42:09] says it that's where a lot of people
[1:42:11] don't get the idea maybe is the thought
[1:42:13] that I try to
[1:42:15] make you say well but brother
[1:42:17] Dale uh I don't find us in the Bible I
[1:42:21] can find this I can find that I can read
[1:42:23] this I can see Paul Peter but I don't
[1:42:25] find us in the
[1:42:28] Bible the Book of
[1:42:32] Revelations the book we were told to
[1:42:34] stay away
[1:42:35] from that we couldn't understand it the
[1:42:39] entire Book of Revelations is speaking
[1:42:42] about
[1:42:43] somebody and the biggest portion of that
[1:42:46] is speaking about you and
[1:42:49] I if you want to read yourself read the
[1:42:52] book of
[1:42:53] Revelation cuz I invite you to show me
[1:42:56] anywhere in the Book of Revelation that
[1:42:58] Jesus Christ is Ever
[1:43:04] by come on even after we get out of here
[1:43:06] he's through the two
[1:43:08] witnesses show me where he's everbody in
[1:43:11] the Book of Revelation the book we were
[1:43:12] told to stay away
[1:43:15] from is our
[1:43:17] book to let us know who we are
[1:43:21] well I just read about a white horse and
[1:43:23] a red horse and a and a I just read and
[1:43:26] that's just confusing to
[1:43:29] me why is it confusing go get the
[1:43:32] prophet's message and let him explain
[1:43:35] what that
[1:43:39] means
[1:43:41] right and let him it tell about these
[1:43:45] things like I said here in and we've
[1:43:48] been reading you know one in the m seven
[1:43:50] golden candles sck like unto the son of
[1:43:52] man brother Brandon plainly states bride
[1:43:59] form he's shown in Bride
[1:44:03] form why don't we read the book of
[1:44:04] Revelation then is wonderful book to
[1:44:06] describe everything to us because it is
[1:44:09] the book that tells us about heaven it
[1:44:12] is the book that tells us about the
[1:44:13] opening of the word it's the book that
[1:44:16] tells us about the whole Plan of
[1:44:19] Redemption
[1:44:22] but we read it still and typ into the
[1:44:26] symbolics well the prophet told us about
[1:44:28] the symbolics if you have any trouble
[1:44:30] with I'll be glad to let you have my
[1:44:31] Bible on a short
[1:44:35] term I've done that one time and brother
[1:44:38] Reed he he finally I sent him one
[1:44:41] because Jos had one and we we got up and
[1:44:44] old Bible and let him take it cuz he
[1:44:47] wanted to get all of the things I wrote
[1:44:48] on the side you know where the uh you
[1:44:51] you may not write in your Bible that's
[1:44:53] that's that's okay I don't I'm not going
[1:44:55] to condemn you but where brother bandam
[1:44:57] explain something I like to write it
[1:44:59] down you
[1:45:01] know you
[1:45:03] know and then somebody comes along I
[1:45:05] said well they used to call my Bible
[1:45:08] they used to say in the in the Bible
[1:45:10] study that Jos had to cheat cheat
[1:45:13] sheet because he had it written down on
[1:45:16] the side what it was all about and you
[1:45:18] just turn over and read it
[1:45:23] where he says in chapter
[1:45:28] five he said it's not a verse by
[1:45:32] verse
[1:45:34] happening he said it's a
[1:45:40] scene not a verse by verse do it he said
[1:45:43] it's a scene well see that it hits me I
[1:45:46] write it down any more questions if
[1:45:49] anybody got anything
[1:45:53] sister
[1:46:03] G I just have a question Genesis 126 and
[1:46:07] Genesis 27 is it possible that that
[1:46:09] happened at the same
[1:46:12] time and if not why would it be that he
[1:46:15] would create like them a theophany and
[1:46:17] then flesh later on well it couldn't be
[1:46:20] at the same time because of the 126 man
[1:46:24] being the even was created for the
[1:46:27] foundation of the world you know see we
[1:46:30] put it there as on the sixth day right
[1:46:34] but remember like I've stated to you if
[1:46:37] you're reading the the uh Genesis
[1:46:39] account you you you got to be real
[1:46:42] careful how you put that account because
[1:46:45] the Man was created on the sixth day but
[1:46:47] yet it's done moved over to where it
[1:46:49] looks like that he's in the seventh but
[1:46:51] he's not he's in the sixth day all right
[1:46:55] so his creation was spiritual man first
[1:46:58] which would be before the foundation of
[1:47:00] the world as far as my concerned amen
[1:47:03] but then the physical man would be
[1:47:05] chapter 2 see then you put the spiritual
[1:47:08] man into the physical
[1:47:11] man so they could be
[1:47:14] Untold eons of time between the
[1:47:18] spiritual part in the physical Genesis
[1:47:22] 2 but it wouldn't make no difference if
[1:47:24] it was Split
[1:47:25] Second you know it would still be
[1:47:28] different it wouldn't be the same
[1:47:32] point but it would be you know because
[1:47:35] to me you got to have the you got to get
[1:47:37] it together where the morning star sang
[1:47:38] together sons of God shout it for Joy
[1:47:40] the mind of God and all the things that
[1:47:41] he saw and then you got to go to uh uh
[1:47:46] Ezekiel 18:4 All Souls are mine and then
[1:47:50] go back to the point that brother
[1:47:51] brandham said All Souls in the mind of
[1:47:53] God was created for the
[1:47:58] world you got to go back up into that to
[1:48:00] be able to come down then to see that
[1:48:02] the Genesis 2 man was a physical
[1:48:04] creation that come after the world right
[1:48:08] see to me Genesis 1 was way before the
[1:48:10] world yes amen it's just placed over
[1:48:13] here as to and it's
[1:48:17] placed really so far over as I said it's
[1:48:20] hard for you to say this the sixth
[1:48:23] day you if brother randam didn't say it
[1:48:26] was a sixth day I could argue with you
[1:48:28] about it because it sure don't look like
[1:48:30] it look like the seventh day when man
[1:48:33] comes into being but he said no that he
[1:48:34] come to being on the sixth day but his
[1:48:37] spiritual condition was before the world
[1:48:40] ever
[1:48:41] begot to being part of
[1:48:45] him that's why I believe that your soul
[1:48:47] is your theophany if you're born again
[1:48:51] and that's eternal
[1:48:53] life that all
[1:48:55] right anything else anybody
[1:49:03] else we're doing pretty good I got about
[1:49:07] 7 minutes after 4 so we took a little
[1:49:10] longer than I thought we would let's go
[1:49:12] into the communion finish that up get it
[1:49:15] out of the way and then we will go eat
[1:49:20] some
[1:49:21] pizza and they have a good time doing
[1:49:23] that it's all right if the brothers they
[1:49:27] got it
[1:49:28] ready all
[1:49:32] right so let's
[1:49:34] stand we'll go into the
[1:49:36] communion any more
[1:49:40] questions I don't have the answer to
[1:49:42] everything I got a lot of questions
[1:49:45] too that you pray
[1:49:49] me sister cath going to be getting on
[1:49:52] anane and they going to be flying out of

[1:50:22] watchband don't worry about wearing him
[1:50:24] out you ain't going to wear the Holy
[1:50:26] Ghost off of it so if you say well well
[1:50:29] I happen to take a bath with that on
[1:50:31] don't worry about it you ain't going to
[1:50:33] wash the Holy Ghost
[1:50:35] off he's the one that's going to take
[1:50:37] care of you all the way through so let's
[1:50:39] pray about our brother and sister having
[1:50:41] a safe trip okay father we ask you to
[1:50:45] just bless and be with Brother Ray

[1:51:14] tell sister Mary we said
[1:51:18] IO
[1:51:21] okay we'll go
[1:51:22] into 1 Corinthians
[1:51:25] 11
[1:51:28] 23 for I have received of the Lord that
[1:51:31] which also I delivered unto you that the
[1:51:34] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[1:51:35] was betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:51:38] given thanks he broke it and said take
[1:51:40] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:51:42] you this do in remembrance of me after
[1:51:45] the same manner also he took the cup
[1:51:47] when he had sub saying this cup is the
[1:51:50] New Testament in my blood this do ye as
[1:51:52] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[1:51:53] me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:51:56] and drink this cup you do you the Lord's
[1:51:57] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[1:52:00] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:52:02] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:52:04] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[1:52:06] let a man examine himself and so let him
[1:52:09] eat of that bread and drink of that cup
[1:52:10] cuz remember if you don't have the
[1:52:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost then you're
[1:52:14] not supposed to take the
[1:52:16] communion that's that's the point it's
[1:52:18] it's not supposed to be until you settle
[1:52:21] that with God for he that eateth and
[1:52:23] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:52:25] them Nation to himself not Discerning
[1:52:27] the Lord's body for this caused many are
[1:52:29] weak and sickly among you and many sleep
[1:52:32] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:52:34] should not be judged but when we're
[1:52:35] judged we are chasen of the Lord that we
[1:52:38] should not be condemned with the world
[1:52:40] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:52:42] together to eat ter one for another and
[1:52:45] if any man hunger let him eat at home
[1:52:47] that you come not together un
[1:52:49] condemnation
[1:52:50] the rest will I set in order when I come
[1:52:53] so let's just have a few moments of
[1:52:55] Silent prayer praying one for another
[1:52:58] and just keep praying for Brother Gary
[1:53:00] because you he needs our
[1:53:18] prayers
[1:53:20] father we love you and we thank you and
[1:53:22] we ask you to just bless each one make
[1:53:24] us worthy to be able to take this
[1:53:26] communion today because we know that
[1:53:27] there's nothing in us that is worthy of
[1:53:30] anything but yet you are the one that's
[1:53:32] worthy so you just come Lord and you set
[1:53:36] us all aside that we could have this
[1:53:38] time of communion together we love you
[1:53:41] and we thank you in Jesus
[1:53:47] name the Bible said he took bread and
[1:53:49] blessed it father we ask you to just
[1:53:52] bless this bread been made for this
[1:53:54] purpose this afternoon that we may
[1:53:56] partake of this and do of what you
[1:53:58] called to us an ordinance or a thing for
[1:54:01] the church to do we have this Lord and
[1:54:04] we believe you and we thank you this is
[1:54:06] not your
[1:54:08] body no more than the wine is not your
[1:54:11] blood but it's in symbolics and we thank
[1:54:14] you for us us having that understanding
[1:54:17] of all things being right we love you
[1:54:20] now we ask you to sanctify this bread
[1:54:22] and the partakers in Jesus name
[1:54:39] amen this is not a just a play thing or
[1:54:42] just a a little ordinance that we
[1:54:46] take but it is a reality of the word of
[1:54:49] God
[1:54:50] because our Lord and Master said for us
[1:54:52] to do this until he come well there's
[1:54:56] people in the
[1:54:57] message that think the Lord has come so
[1:54:59] much that they don't take communion well
[1:55:02] I I just don't go along with that I
[1:55:05] think he's talking more of the physical
[1:55:07] part of his coming that is not complete
[1:55:10] yet and in doing that then we just go
[1:55:13] right on take into communion and don't
[1:55:16] worry about nobody else but we're not
[1:55:17] condemning anybody else for their
[1:55:19] thoughts or ideas we're just being what
[1:55:22] we are and doing what we believe and
[1:55:25] letting it be it that
[1:55:31] way Lord Jesus we thank you for this
[1:55:33] wine it's went through the process and
[1:55:36] now gets better with each day because
[1:55:38] it's a type of your blood Lord that was
[1:55:40] shed for us and we thank you we ask you
[1:55:42] to sanctify the wine and the partakers
[1:55:45] as we together
[1:55:47] Lord can say thank you for all things
[1:55:51] and as we eat the natural little piece
[1:55:52] of bread and drink this little wine
[1:55:55] tomorrow it will be blood cells in our
[1:55:57] body cuz there a literal part of it we
[1:56:01] thank you for all things we love you
[1:56:04] sanctify the wine and the partakers in
[1:56:06] Jesus name
[1:56:11] amen come
[1:56:14] morning I
[1:56:16] walk by the river
[1:56:21] I'll rest need the
[1:56:24] Ever Green
[1:56:28] Tree I'll
[1:56:30] carry my
[1:56:33] cross through the
[1:56:36] midnight come
[1:56:38] morning there
[1:56:48] Glory
[1:56:59] then I take one more look at Mount
[1:57:05] Calvary and it gives me the strength to
[1:57:11] go
[1:57:12] on come
[1:57:15] morning I
[1:57:17] walk by the

[1:57:36] midnight come
[1:57:38] morning there's
[1:57:41] glory for
[1:57:44] me you know to think about the way God
[1:57:47] does things what about each CH a
[1:57:50] man that had no physical connection
[1:57:54] there was no way tide would be in there
[1:57:57] when he spoke the things to the
[1:57:59] disciples but he chose the Apostle Paul
[1:58:02] to write about the
[1:58:04] communion you
[1:58:06] know because he could tie it together
[1:58:08] with the Old Testament and bring it out
[1:58:09] into being and and let it be into
[1:58:13] manifestation or maybe the
