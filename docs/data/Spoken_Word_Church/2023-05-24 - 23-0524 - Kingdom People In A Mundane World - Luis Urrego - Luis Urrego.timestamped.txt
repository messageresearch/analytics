[3:46] testimony
[3:51] God bless you all
[3:59] amen thank the Lord
[4:02] um I just want to share this testimony
[4:03] sometime you know when something come on
[4:05] your heart to do it you don't do it
[4:06] right away is still feeling like it's
[4:08] going away so
[4:10] um this happened a couple weeks ago it's
[4:12] got to do with my tidings
[4:14] and um I would set my ties aside but
[4:18] sometimes if I have it on me and I need
[4:19] a little extra cash I'll dip into it and
[4:22] I'll just tell the Lord I'll pay you
[4:23] back when I you know I'll pay you back
[4:25] I'll put it back in there so that was
[4:27] going on for a while and um
[4:29] lately I just started feeling like you
[4:30] know what learning leave your money
[4:31] alone and and just when I put it aside
[4:34] leave it there and just send it where I
[4:35] need to go on time
[4:37] so um I made kind of like a little vow
[4:38] with my heart and make a big deal out of
[4:40] it
[4:41] um
[4:42] so this particular day a couple weeks
[4:44] ago I was getting ready for church and I
[4:47] ended up putting like um about ten
[4:48] dollars or so in my pocket in one of my
[4:50] skirts pocket and um sometime if I'm
[4:53] rushing I'll stop and get something to
[4:55] eat you know before I get to church
[4:57] so um for some reason I went somewhere
[4:59] and came back home I changed my skirt
[5:00] and everything and I forgot about the
[5:02] ten dollars in my pocket so all I had
[5:04] was my tax money and I had that in my
[5:06] purse already and um I was making my way
[5:08] to go get something to eat and I
[5:11] realized I changed my skirt
[5:12] so I was like man you know and I thought
[5:15] about my times I said well you know
[5:17] maybe I can just go ahead and get it and
[5:19] um I got I got the money at home so I
[5:20] can always replace it but as soon as I
[5:23] did that like that little feeling of my
[5:24] spirit came on and said well you
[5:25] remember me made a little vow in your
[5:27] heart that you weren't gonna touch that
[5:28] tax money again
[5:30] so um I was like man you know there's a
[5:32] little devil on your shoulder like well
[5:33] you know gotta understand you know you'd
[5:35] be all right so um I was like nah
[5:37] something else convinced me like no just
[5:40] do what you said you're gonna do because
[5:41] if you buy this burger or whatever
[5:43] you're gonna be eating and feeling
[5:44] guilty you ain't gonna enjoy it you know
[5:46] so um I was like yeah Mama just leave it
[5:49] gotta somehow provide I was hungry that
[5:52] day only I was hungry I was like gotta
[5:54] provide somehow some food gonna come
[5:55] from somewhere I'm going to church so um
[5:59] I stopped at a little um gas station uh
[6:02] not too far on the way and I was like
[6:04] well sometimes they let me get a free
[6:05] cup of coffee you know I'm gonna go in
[6:07] there and see if that coffee Mike and
[6:08] slap that hungry you know
[6:10] so I had like 80 cents on me I had like
[6:13] 80 cents on me and changing my car said
[6:14] well I'm gonna go in here and see if
[6:15] they give me a cup of coffee and I'll
[6:16] pay them back you know uh so I went in
[6:19] there the lady was like go ahead you
[6:20] know I told her what happened I left my
[6:21] money on my skirt and um I'll pay you
[6:23] when I come back and she was like go
[6:24] ahead get the coffee or whatever so I
[6:26] enjoyed the coffee on the way to church
[6:27] or whatever
[6:29] um I got to church I sat down and um
[6:32] I wasn't even thinking anymore about the
[6:34] money or anything I just sat down kind
[6:35] of opened up my Bible when I opened it I
[6:37] seen ten dollars in there folded up
[6:41] and um it was just I know it's little
[6:43] but it was special to me you know it was
[6:45] ten dollars in my Bible and my mom when
[6:49] she was with me maybe a week or so back
[6:50] a couple days ago she had ten dollars
[6:53] and she got some changes she forgot what
[6:56] she did with the ten dollars and she
[6:57] asked me to look at my Bible to see if
[6:58] she ended up putting it in there and I
[7:00] totally forgot about it I I didn't even
[7:02] look I wasn't thinking I forgot about
[7:03] the ten dollars or forgot to even look
[7:05] so anyway I'm just saying that to say um
[7:08] God already knew and she had her purse
[7:09] and everything with it I don't know why
[7:10] she put it in my Bible but God already
[7:12] knew what was going to happen ahead of
[7:14] time and to allow her to do that and
[7:17] just set everything up I just want to
[7:18] lift him up he's so wonderful in the
[7:21] small things and the big things and he

[24:45] that this life amen the life that we
[24:47] know this current civilization that we
[24:50] know of Amen it will disappear
[24:52] it will be done away with because right
[24:54] now this is Satan's kingdom amen but
[24:56] there is a kingdom that cannot be moved

[25:15] possession of you
[25:17] amen so let that Kingdom be born in US
[25:20] amen that we may manifest that Kingdom
[25:22] on the outside amen and if you I like
[25:25] what brother brother William said this
[25:27] this past Sunday I've often said the
[25:29] same thing is that if you can't get a
[25:32] whole possession of this Kingdom how are
[25:34] you going to possess this Kingdom out
[25:35] here
[25:36] amen that's why Jesus said amen if you
[25:39] if you how can you help your brother
[25:40] amen spiritually when you're you need
[25:43] spiritual help you see that's why he
[25:46] told Peter he said amen uh go get
[25:48] converted first before you can go
[25:50] strengthen your brethren amen so what is
[25:54] an important thing in this house it's

[27:25] amundane
[27:27] mundane
[27:29] daily routine of life

[28:12] ask
[28:13] but do you think that the kingdom of God
[28:15] can shine in the middle of your routine
[28:19] do you think that the kingdom of God can
[28:21] shine in the middle of you sisters amen
[28:24] out there changing your baby's diapers
[28:27] the kingdom of God can shine in the mid
[28:29] of you scrubbing that next that my
[28:32] husband left that bowl of corn flakes
[28:34] from the night before and it just dried
[28:36] up and stuck in that bowl and I just
[28:38] can't get it out
[28:39] you think that the the the kingdom of
[28:42] God can shine in that
[28:44] amen I believe it can
[28:47] see we don't think that God is not in
[28:49] these little in these little matters
[28:51] amen but I believe God is in those
[28:53] matters hence the reason why God allowed
[28:55] them in your life
[28:57] because he's building character why he's
[28:58] building Kingdom people
[29:00] praise the Lord amen so we're just gonna
[29:03] we're gonna read this in Luke chapter
[29:05] 17. and when he was demanded of the
[29:08] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[29:10] come
[29:11] he answered them and said the kingdom of
[29:14] God cometh not with observation in other
[29:18] words it's not noticeable
[29:21] it's you can't really tell that it's
[29:23] even there
[29:25] amen neither shall they say Lo here or
[29:29] Lo there for behold the kingdom of God
[29:32] is within you amen I like the way the
[29:35] New Living Translation says it it says
[29:37] it this way one day the Pharisees asked
[29:39] Jesus when all the kingdom of God when
[29:42] will the kingdom of God come Jesus
[29:44] replied the kingdom of God can't be
[29:47] detected by visible signs
[29:50] hmm you won't be able to say here it is
[29:53] or it's over there for the kingdom of
[29:56] God is already among you
[29:59] now that was Jesus speaking because why
[30:01] he is the kingdom amen so I like the way
[30:05] it's it's phrases it there because
[30:07] it can't be within you at that time
[30:10] because Jesus had not died and
[30:12] resurrected and have not come back in
[30:14] the form of the holy spirit so it wasn't
[30:16] within them at that time amen but it was
[30:18] amongst them at the time later it comes
[30:21] in in them amen in the form of the Holy
[30:24] Spirit praise the Lord Jesus and one
[30:26] more scripture in Zechariah Chapter 4 it
[30:28] says very familiar scripture on to us
[30:31] verses 5.
[30:33] then the angel that talked with me
[30:35] answered and said unto me knowest thou
[30:37] not what these be and I said know my
[30:40] Lord then he answered and spake unto me
[30:42] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[30:45] the rubable saying
[30:47] not by might
[30:49] nor by power
[30:51] in other words no pushing or pulling
[30:54] or no pulling or pushing
[30:56] has nothing to do with you but why but
[30:58] by my spirit says the Lord of hosts amen
[31:02] you may be seated this evening
[31:05] praise the Lord
[31:10] amen so not by might not by power amen
[31:13] but by my spirit saith the Lord and and
[31:16] I I'll put that scripture in there
[31:18] because the spirit amen we know that the
[31:21] holy spirit this spirit is the kingdom
[31:23] of God Amen and
[31:26] and we we know that the spirit of the
[31:28] Lord amen we're going to read that verse
[31:29] 7 there in Zechariah towards the end of
[31:32] the service but we know that the spirit
[31:34] of the Lord amen That Came Upon Jesus
[31:36] who is the kingdom amen and what did it
[31:39] do when the when the spirit Came Upon
[31:42] him amen remember when Jesus got up and
[31:44] he and and he was given to him amen the
[31:47] scroll he went to the temple the Bible
[31:49] says as was his custom amen so Jesus
[31:53] went to church amen Jesus made it
[31:56] accustomed to go to church amen it might
[31:59] be a a it was a routine amen well it's
[32:02] Sunday so we go to church it's Wednesday
[32:05] so we go to church every time those
[32:06] doors amen open we go we go to church
[32:09] amen and I'm not I'm not hitting on
[32:11] anybody who hasn't come or wasn't here
[32:13] Sunday that's not what I'm trying to do
[32:14] I'm just trying to tell you that brother
[32:15] but that that Jesus went to church amen
[32:19] and he went to church and he's our
[32:21] example how much more should we do that
[32:23] amen praise God so and and Luke chapter
[32:27] 4 verse 16 it says and and he came to
[32:30] Nazareth where he had been brought up
[32:33] amen and as as his custom was he went
[32:37] into the synagogue on the Sabbath day
[32:39] and stood up for to read
[32:42] and and there was delivered unto him the
[32:44] book of the prophet isaiahs and when he
[32:47] had opened the book he found the place
[32:49] where it was written and it's
[32:51] interesting because the Bible says it
[32:53] that way that he found the place in
[32:54] other words he was specifically
[32:56] searching for that specific spot
[32:59] amen because if you don't search you
[33:02] don't find right
[33:03] so I believe that's just me personally I
[33:06] I believe that he actually specifically
[33:08] went to that specific searching for that
[33:11] specific scripture amen because there
[33:13] was something that was getting ready to
[33:14] unfold there amen and he says there and
[33:17] he says and the spirit of the Lord
[33:20] is upon me he started reading this
[33:22] scripture the spirit of the Lord is upon
[33:25] me because he hath anointed me to preach
[33:28] the gospel to the poor he had sent me to
[33:30] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[33:33] Deliverance to the captives and
[33:35] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[33:38] at Liberty them that are bruised to
[33:41] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[33:44] and he closed the book and he gave it
[33:48] again to the minister and sat down and
[33:51] the eyes of them that were in the
[33:53] synagogue were fasting on him and he
[33:55] began to say unto them this day this
[33:58] scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[34:03] amen now we're going to ready and now in
[34:05] verse 22 it says and all bear him
[34:06] witness and wondered at the gracious
[34:08] Words which proceeded out of his mouth
[34:10] and they said the people around them
[34:12] said is this not Joseph's son
[34:15] in other words he's he's a commoner or
[34:17] monk says is this not Joseph's son
[34:20] someone common someone who didn't who
[34:23] didn't seem like that the kingdom was
[34:25] there that the king that was showing
[34:27] forth the kingdom but the kingdom of God
[34:29] was right there amongst them amen
[34:31] and they didn't even know the Messiah
[34:34] that they were praying about and they
[34:36] were asking for was standing right there
[34:39] in front of them and they had no clue
[34:41] that it was happening praise the Lord
[34:43] amen I forgot we forgot to pray so let's
[34:46] just buy our heads real quick our
[34:48] heavenly father we just thank you once
[34:49] again for the opportunity to open back
[34:51] the pages of your word we asked Lord
[34:53] Jesus that you would just to anoint your
[34:55] word father as we go forth and speak
[34:57] father God a few things Lord to help
[34:59] encourage your people Lord may you just
[35:01] bless put your anointing upon it father
[35:03] for this is your word Lord forgive us
[35:06] for all of our sins Lord and cleanse us
[35:07] father and we pray Lord Jesus that you
[35:10] would just be with us father and be with
[35:11] sister June and and those that couldn't
[35:14] be here father God may you just bless
[35:15] them Lord and strengthen them Father God
[35:18] touch their bodies Lord Jesus and and we
[35:21] just commit the rest of the service into
[35:22] your hands in Jesus Christ's name and
[35:24] For Your Glory we ask amen amen praise
[35:27] the Lord Jesus
[35:28] now brother Brandon says says here we've
[35:31] we've read this quote many times and and
[35:33] speaking about what Jesus uh what
[35:36] happened here in this in this uh
[35:38] situation where where Jesus was reading
[35:41] this scripture brother Brown says this
[35:43] he says some people gets the wrong
[35:46] impression of what the anointing is
[35:49] did you ever think of that
[35:52] when was the greatest anointing ever
[35:55] give to anyone and what did they do when
[35:59] they had the anointing now we have we
[36:02] especially those who grew up in the
[36:03] Pentecostal realms
[36:06] you know I grew up as a Baptist Catholic
[36:08] uh Jehovah's Witness so I was bringing
[36:12] pretty much ho-hum type of religions you
[36:14] know people didn't really Shout Scream
[36:16] and if you clapped your hands in the
[36:18] Baptist Church I mean you were looked at
[36:20] very badly
[36:22] that was a No-No amen so it it was no
[36:27] but so it was very new to me when I came
[36:29] to the message and I started visiting
[36:31] message churches and and people were
[36:33] more active and more lively and more
[36:36] clapping and things like that I was
[36:39] almost it was I was almost in condemning
[36:42] mode I'm like a bunch of sinners
[36:45] look at them making all that noise and
[36:47] all that racket when we should be
[36:50] holy
[36:52] the Lord deserves respect
[36:55] but you see later on I I started
[36:57] learning amen that that everything that
[37:00] has breath praised the Lord
[37:03] I started learning amen that that that
[37:05] that that nature rejoices amen and
[37:08] praises the Lord in its way
[37:11] amen when the wind blows amen through
[37:13] the trees the trees don't stay still
[37:16] the trees start to move amen when when
[37:20] when when when things are happening amen
[37:22] and the Animals amen they will get up
[37:24] the birds get up in the morning amen you
[37:26] don't think the birds are quiet
[37:28] I mean the birds you hear them birds
[37:31] outside your window and I got this one
[37:33] little bird outside my window right
[37:35] there at the back of my house it has
[37:36] this specific little chirp and normally
[37:39] birds are good and they're fine they're
[37:41] lovely but this one's got a certain
[37:42] chirp I don't know if it's sick or what
[37:45] but it it it sounds sick
[37:50] but it's praising the Lord
[37:52] amen because God gave him that that
[37:55] ability to do so amen it's it's doing
[37:58] what it was meant to do amen I believe
[38:01] he's praising the Lord or maybe he's
[38:02] he's trying to draw attention or
[38:05] whatever he's doing but I believe that
[38:07] he's doing it amen because he's praising
[38:09] his creator amen praise the Lord Jesus
[38:13] and so we we see that we come here into
[38:16] this life amen and and we we worship in
[38:19] different ways amen so I grew up that
[38:20] way amen and I started to realize amen
[38:23] people amen they have their different
[38:25] ways of of worshiping amen
[38:28] that's just how it is some some of us
[38:31] are more quiet some of us are more loud
[38:33] some of us are more in the kind of in
[38:35] the middle in between amen but God loves
[38:38] it all
[38:40] God doesn't prefer one over the other
[38:44] amen and so neither should we as as well
[38:48] that's why I I personally do not I
[38:51] believe there should be balance in in
[38:54] this way of thinking because here
[38:56] amongst people amen we we see that some
[39:00] Prevail in the idea of if you're not if
[39:03] you're not too real real Pentecostal
[39:05] like amen then you're not you're not
[39:08] getting the blessings of the Lord
[39:10] but then we so we have here some uh
[39:13] right here on this side amen that say
[39:15] well you got to be quiet and you just
[39:16] have to just you have to just be very
[39:19] reverent and very quiet and I believe
[39:21] that you have to be reverent amen but
[39:23] there's a there's a point amen that that
[39:25] there's got to be a balance
[39:27] amen there's a balance amen because when
[39:30] when something strikes you amen and and
[39:33] and and God has done something in your
[39:35] life you can't help but do something
[39:37] about that you can't help to tell
[39:39] someone you can't help to to to to to to
[39:42] to let someone know to sing about it to
[39:45] shout about it amen I'm just kind of
[39:47] going a little bit of what brother
[39:48] William was saying because I really
[39:49] enjoyed what he had to say on Sunday
[39:51] amen
[39:52] I thought that that was very striking
[39:54] amen very Timely
[39:56] many people nowadays amen is very
[39:59] unbalanced you have those that are very
[40:00] Pentecostal and if you don't lean that
[40:02] way then you're not in the message but
[40:04] then those amen who just very much quiet
[40:06] amen and it's all about if you just
[40:08] don't listen and T and and it's all
[40:11] about the teaching then you're not in
[40:12] the message and I believe there's a
[40:14] balance of both
[40:15] amen that's why God gave us a thoughtful
[40:18] Ministry amen it's a balance
[40:21] what do we have to have a balanced diet
[40:23] in order to live a balanced life
[40:26] so if you have to have a balanced diet
[40:28] physically how much more spiritually
[40:30] amen so you Worship the Lord in the way
[40:34] that God gave you to worship God
[40:37] amen
[40:38] and no one should condemn you for
[40:40] let uh if maybe you're not doing it
[40:44] right then the Lord let the Lord deal
[40:47] with you on that
[40:49] but you be the one amen but within
[40:51] inside of you amen you say Lord I I want
[40:55] to worship you because I'm so thankful
[40:57] what you've done in my life
[40:59] I'm so I'm so appreciative of what you
[41:02] have uh uh uh how you've led me how you
[41:05] have protected me I remember that
[41:08] certain situation back in in in a
[41:10] certain time amen and how God you you
[41:12] watched over me during that time I got
[41:14] something to worship you about I got
[41:16] something to praise you about I got
[41:19] something amen that to to testify about
[41:21] amen appreciate sister Rebecca and her
[41:23] testimony amen it was just ten ten
[41:26] dollars amen but it was ten dollars
[41:28] that's worth for for a testimony amen
[41:30] that was a blessing for her and that was
[41:32] her way of worshiping amen
[41:34] is for her to testify about it
[41:37] sometimes amen we don't want to testify
[41:39] because maybe God isn't doing some
[41:41] anything in our lives
[41:43] so we really don't have a testimony
[41:47] and that's not his fault
[41:50] that's your fault
[41:52] hey man
[41:54] that's you and I fault amen God wants to
[41:57] do great things in our lives amen so
[42:00] that we could share testimony so that we
[42:02] can we can uh let others know so that it
[42:04] can light their fire like their candles
[42:07] praise the Lord Jesus all right don't
[42:09] get sleepy on me
[42:11] so we see here amen that Jesus brother
[42:14] Brandon says here let's continue reading
[42:17] this this quote
[42:19] the greatest anointing that was ever
[42:22] given to anyone was Jesus Christ
[42:25] we have the spirit by measure he had it
[42:27] without measure and one day he entered
[42:30] into the temple and picked up the scroll
[42:32] and read said the spirit of God is upon
[42:35] me for he has anointed me to preach the
[42:36] acceptable year to bind up the broken
[42:39] hearts to heal the sick give sight to
[42:41] the Blind and now we would think if such
[42:46] anointing was on him that that have been
[42:49] prophesied 800 years before that it
[42:52] would come and here he was with that
[42:55] type of anointing the full blessing and
[42:57] anointing of the Lord upon him
[42:59] we would want to run all over the
[43:02] building scream and holler
[43:05] that that's what we would think I mean
[43:07] especially if those who who grew up in
[43:09] the Pentecostal Realms amen you hear the
[43:12] word anointing of God is upon it
[43:14] starts shaking and you start amen
[43:18] that's fine
[43:20] that but it just really depends on how
[43:22] you grew up
[43:23] you see
[43:25] and so we would think that that the
[43:28] anointing how many can say that Jesus
[43:29] had the anointing there while he was
[43:31] reading that scripture
[43:34] but but watch what brother Brown says if
[43:36] you haven't read this quote before
[43:38] we would want to run all over the
[43:39] building scream and holler but the Bible
[43:41] said he laid down the scroll and sat
[43:44] down and press his words proceeded from
[43:47] his mouth
[43:49] now I believe he wasn't
[43:52] slobbering and shouting and talking real
[43:55] close to the microphone
[43:56] [Music]
[43:58] if they didn't have microphone at that
[44:00] time
[44:02] that's what he done under the anointing
[44:08] that's what he done under the anointing
[44:09] he just put the scroll the scripture up
[44:11] and started speaking words from his
[44:14] mouth amen I believe the people
[44:16] understood because they reacted to what
[44:18] he was saying amen
[44:21] and watch what he says here brother
[44:23] Branham this is your prophet he says
[44:25] here the anointing is not emotions
[44:29] but he's not saying that emotions are
[44:31] bad
[44:34] that that's where we misunderstand that
[44:38] having an emotion a genuine emotion amen
[44:42] happened to you because the holy spirit
[44:43] is working and and doing something amen
[44:46] hey let that happen
[44:48] because we all need to to to to to uh to
[44:52] to receive from that as well
[44:55] but what choice has here the anointing
[44:57] is supreme power
[45:00] in control now what is the power
[45:03] amen is the power the power of the Holy
[45:06] Ghost amen
[45:07] supreme power in control
[45:11] like knowing exactly what and how see
[45:16] and that's what's here
[45:20] so I believe brother Brandon is saying
[45:21] amen that that's what the holy spirit
[45:23] will cause you to do that's what the
[45:25] great anointing will cause you to do is
[45:28] supreme power in control
[45:31] amen it's no and amen
[45:34] knowing when to and when not to
[45:39] amen
[45:40] because for those who are more quiet and
[45:45] have grown up in more quiet type
[45:47] churches now what does this have to do
[45:49] with mundane and stuff like that we'll
[45:50] get to that in here in just a moment
[45:53] but for those who like it quiet oh they
[45:56] love that quote
[45:58] oh Amen to that oh yes hit them hit
[46:03] those Pentecostal type of Brothers
[46:06] that hold those tent meetings and
[46:07] shouting and just causing a ruckus amen
[46:10] just hit him
[46:11] and they love that quote
[46:14] they love that that Jesus
[46:17] that Jesus right there they like
[46:21] but what about the Jesus when Jesus was
[46:23] sitting on a donkey one day
[46:25] riding on on a coal on on on on a donkey
[46:29] and here comes the people and the Bible
[46:31] says his disciples were the ones his own
[46:34] disciples were the ones who started the
[46:37] shouting and the hosannas and all of
[46:39] that and everybody else started it as
[46:42] well I mean it started following along
[46:44] as well praising God Amen
[46:47] and the Pharisees the ones that go you
[46:50] know to the quiet Church
[46:52] they started rebuking Jesus telling him
[46:55] why don't you say something your
[46:56] disciples they're disturbing the peace
[46:59] and what did Jesus say
[47:01] he said if they don't cry out the rocks
[47:04] will
[47:06] amen
[47:09] now the Pentecostal type of Brothers now
[47:12] they love that type of Jesus
[47:15] they like that Jesus
[47:17] you see
[47:18] that's how we should be that's how it is
[47:22] but see I believe that there should be a
[47:25] balance in all of it
[47:27] let the Holy Spirit do what he wants to
[47:30] do
[47:31] and you are you should be able to
[47:34] willing to Pivot
[47:37] Amen to however the holy spirit is
[47:39] moving but that's the thing we've grown
[47:42] up in certain ways certain mentality and
[47:44] if the holy spirit is moving a certain
[47:46] way until oh I like it okay it's moving
[47:49] it's fine but if it's doing it's right
[47:51] oh no I I
[47:53] can't seem to Pivot towards that
[47:56] because I'm starchy I am settled in my
[47:59] in my ways
[48:00] and I don't think that that's what God
[48:02] is calling us to do
[48:05] God is not God is calling us to be
[48:08] flexible look what he says Look what
[48:09] Jesus says Amen in in Matthew chapter 10
[48:14] verse 16 he says behold I send you forth
[48:17] as sheep in the midst of wolves be
[48:20] therefore wise as serpents
[48:23] amen and harmless as doves
[48:27] amen in other words be flexible be
[48:30] willing to Pivot amen when it's neat
[48:32] when it's needed
[48:34] because the brother that's shouting the
[48:36] sister that's screaming or or happy
[48:38] rejoicing in the Lord amen she's just
[48:42] praising God just as you are praising
[48:44] God in your heart amen with your hand
[48:46] down
[48:47] maybe you're not raising your hand
[48:49] but you you're something's happening in
[48:51] you
[48:52] neither one should be condemning one
[48:54] another
[48:55] one should be condemning one another
[48:58] praise the Lord
[49:00] amen
[49:01] so what's the point I'm trying to make
[49:04] what
[49:06] I'm trying to say is have balance and be
[49:08] flexible in your life
[49:10] amen
[49:12] praise God don't just be settled in your
[49:14] ways because I'm going to tell you God
[49:16] is moving
[49:18] and if you have put if the children of
[49:20] Israel if they settled on their own in
[49:22] their way and they put that stake down
[49:24] and they put that tent right there and
[49:27] God kept on moving amen God was they was
[49:29] just gonna be left behind and Moses was
[49:32] going to cross the Red Sea with all the
[49:33] children and they were still back there
[49:35] in the desert
[49:36] Left Behind you're gonna be left behind
[49:38] if you just all settle in your ways and
[49:40] you think that your way is your only way
[49:44] praise the Lord
[49:46] God is moving God is changing amen
[49:48] there's there's this new generation
[49:50] that's coming up amen you have to deal
[49:52] with them in different ways now
[49:55] it can't be the way it was dealt with 50
[49:57] 60 years ago amen they're they're rising
[50:00] up they're seeing different things
[50:01] they're looking at uh uh you have to
[50:04] deal with them in totally different ways
[50:06] and I can't I can't go back amen and
[50:08] look and see how people were fighting at
[50:11] the time I appreciate the old Fighters
[50:13] amen I appreciate brother Dale I
[50:14] appreciate each one of the brothers amen
[50:16] that fought and opened this way amen for
[50:19] us
[50:20] I I'm so thankful for that amen
[50:23] amen we appreciate the ministry amen but
[50:25] I can't go back and look at that and and
[50:27] and get and get caught up in those same
[50:29] type of spirits amen where they were
[50:31] fighting with each other and arguing and
[50:33] fussing and talking and preaching
[50:35] against each other I can't do that
[50:37] amen I just can't get with that I got to
[50:40] move on because this generation needs
[50:42] God
[50:43] just like that generation needed God
[50:45] this generation needs God
[50:48] and I think there's many Brethren from
[50:51] nowadays amen they're realizing that
[50:53] they're seeing amen we can't be fighting
[50:56] and and and and and and back there and
[50:59] the way people were back then these kids
[51:01] they need God
[51:03] you need God you need someone to help
[51:06] you to learn how to be a better mother
[51:09] someone to help you to learn how to be a
[51:11] better father how to be a better a
[51:13] better brother or a better sister amen
[51:15] fussing and arguing about doctrines it
[51:17] didn't ever take us anywhere
[51:21] they all in LED was separations and and
[51:23] condemnations and and here we are amen
[51:27] nowadays amen it's about him it's about
[51:30] Jesus Christ it's about about the young
[51:33] people getting the Holy Ghost amen what
[51:34] are we doing for them
[51:37] so the kingdom of God Amen
[51:40] being reflected Amen in a mundane world
[51:43] Amen in your routine
[51:45] praise God
[51:48] so let's get him back to this to this
[51:50] powerful Kingdom amen of everyday living
[51:55] so here in Luke chapter 17 verse 20 it
[51:58] says and when he was demanded of the
[52:00] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[52:02] come he answered them and said the
[52:04] kingdom of God cometh with no
[52:06] observation
[52:08] in other words there is nothing that you
[52:10] can say there's the kingdom of God
[52:12] that's it
[52:13] you see because it it does this and that
[52:16] and the other amen you
[52:18] Jesus said the wind bloweth
[52:21] and it cometh
[52:23] but you don't and that and that's how
[52:26] the spirit is you don't know where it
[52:27] comes you don't know where it goes
[52:28] that's how the spirit is
[52:31] praise the Lord Jesus
[52:33] it's a mystery
[52:35] you know I preached I preached this
[52:37] several years ago about the kingdom of
[52:39] God had PowerPoint presentation and and
[52:41] and all of that you can go back and
[52:43] listen to it but it really is astounded
[52:46] me and it was striking to me amen how
[52:49] simple the kingdom of God really is
[52:51] because we make it seem to be like it's
[52:53] something mysterious and and
[52:56] but yet in reality it's simple
[53:00] the Simplicity of Christ amen is
[53:02] sometimes so easy for us to to to to let
[53:06] go of
[53:07] amen of how simple of how simple Christ
[53:10] is amen
[53:12] now we know that the holy spirit amen
[53:14] the kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost
[53:17] and so how is it that the kingdom of God
[53:20] can't can't be detected by visible signs
[53:22] amen we look at the Bible amen at
[53:24] examples for example the Sun the moon
[53:26] the stars amen they have routines
[53:30] amen they they come up in the morning or
[53:33] they come up at night and they're there
[53:35] for a purpose according to Genesis
[53:37] chapter 1. amen they are there to for
[53:40] Seasons to give light a man for times
[53:43] for dates amen they have a purpose but
[53:46] yet we see them every day
[53:49] and it just seems like
[53:52] it's ho-hum and oh there's the moon
[53:54] again
[53:56] but the moon has a powerful purpose
[53:59] we don't know all of that that the moon
[54:00] does
[54:02] there's there's there's things about
[54:03] there's mysteries about the Moon that we
[54:05] don't know of and and scientists and
[54:07] NASA amen they still scratch their head
[54:09] about
[54:10] or even what the moon is made of made
[54:12] out of
[54:14] certainly not made out of cheese I can
[54:15] tell you that
[54:20] but it all has a purpose amen
[54:24] how about the cells in our body
[54:27] the cells that that form in our body
[54:29] amen all have a purpose even though we
[54:33] don't see them move remember we're
[54:35] talking about this Kingdom we don't see
[54:36] it move we don't see visible signs but
[54:40] yet the same thing with cells we don't
[54:42] see visible signs of yourselves amen but
[54:45] if we took a Suave a man of DNA or
[54:47] something like that there'll be cells
[54:49] right there and you put that in a Petri
[54:51] dish and and then they'll they'll start
[54:53] replicating and and those cells amen
[54:56] they're replicating in your body and
[54:57] they're forming amen your fingers
[55:00] they're forming your tongue they're
[55:02] forming different parts of your body I
[55:04] mean they're doing things in a mundane
[55:07] type of way
[55:10] you don't see them moving you don't you
[55:12] don't see them forming you don't see you
[55:14] don't see them
[55:15] but they're doing something
[55:18] yeah amen
[55:19] they're doing something the animal life
[55:21] take a look by the way deals with the
[55:23] honeybees amen how are we going to be
[55:25] able to enjoy that that wonderful sweet
[55:28] nectar or that honey that we enjoy and
[55:30] we put on our pancakes in the morning we
[55:32] put in our coffee
[55:34] but yet uh the honeybees day in day out
[55:38] they're doing what they're doing amen
[55:40] and it's producing that honey you don't
[55:43] see it
[55:44] unless you open up their their their
[55:46] their beehives
[55:47] you see what's going on
[55:49] but other than that you don't see what's
[55:51] happening and yet it's producing great
[55:53] things
[55:54] it's the same thing with God Saints
[55:57] amen sometimes we see we we don't see
[55:59] God why I don't see I don't feel you I I
[56:03] I I I don't sense that that you're near
[56:05] amen but I promise you he said that he
[56:08] would be with us
[56:10] even in US amen
[56:12] and something's happening if your desire
[56:14] is to see more of God
[56:17] because because God will you wouldn't
[56:20] have that desire in you if if if if if
[56:22] God wasn't moving in your life
[56:25] praise the Lord amen
[56:28] so oftentimes
[56:30] um in the Bible
[56:32] before there were great we read the
[56:34] stories in the Bible before there were
[56:36] great dramatic events that took place
[56:38] amen
[56:40] there was a time of mundane routine
[56:44] just right before those those times you
[56:47] take Noah for example
[56:48] he preached 120 years
[56:52] day in day out building the ark
[56:56] and and probably people just got tired
[56:59] of listening to Noah's voice
[57:02] of repenting and of of it's going to
[57:06] rain and all these all these things that
[57:08] he was trying to say that he was trying
[57:10] to tell the people that God told him to
[57:12] let the people know for a hundred and
[57:14] twenty years
[57:19] but it produced an ark
[57:22] and It produced The Flood
[57:25] It produced a great dramatic event
[57:28] but it took the whole hum routine
[57:31] of
[57:33] hammering away
[57:34] of sawing
[57:36] amen of
[57:39] preaching
[57:42] of studying
[57:44] of praying
[57:46] it took all those things
[57:49] and one day
[57:51] God did what he said to Noah that he was
[57:53] going to do
[57:54] so before the the the the the dramatic
[57:57] event amen the mundane had to take place
[57:59] amen we take for example Abraham
[58:01] receiving the the promised son
[58:03] he
[58:05] maybe thought that he was going to
[58:07] receive that blessing right there and
[58:08] then but then one one year went by two
[58:11] years went by three years went by
[58:14] 25 years went by
[58:17] and he was still waiting for that
[58:19] promised son
[58:21] wondering with Sarah where is he
[58:26] but he came
[58:28] Sarah got pregnant
[58:30] she received that son
[58:32] amen and the and the and and so that
[58:35] that event they meant culminated amen
[58:37] but it had to take it had to First the
[58:40] mundane had to take place first amen
[58:43] praise the Lord Jesus Moses at the Red
[58:45] Sea Crossing amen we can use that as
[58:47] well amen 40 years he was being prepped
[58:49] in the desert before he could go and
[58:51] take the people and cross over the
[58:52] promised land I'm into the to Across the
[58:55] Red Sea
[58:58] amen the walls of Jericho that's another
[59:00] seven days amen just mundane just
[59:04] marching around
[59:06] going to church and opening my Bible and
[59:10] it was mundane but the walls fell
[59:15] amen
[59:16] the walls eventually fell
[59:18] praise God so I want you to understand
[59:21] this Saints
[59:23] I want you I want you to get this that
[59:26] the mundane the the dramatic events that
[59:29] we read in the scriptures they were not
[59:32] it's not the drum the actual climax of
[59:36] those events that we learned the lessons
[59:38] from that
[59:39] it's not the actual great dramatic
[59:42] climax though where we actually get the
[59:44] lesson it's what happened before that
[59:47] where we actually received the lessons
[59:50] that we need in our life
[59:52] amen because God was working on all
[59:55] these individuals before the dramatic
[59:57] event took place before no before the
[1:00:00] rain came amen God was working in Noah
[1:00:02] 120 years
[1:00:04] you don't think that Noah sometimes felt
[1:00:06] depressed and felt unsure and and and
[1:00:09] and and and and and wondering if he was
[1:00:12] really in the will of God or not why did
[1:00:14] I really hear from God
[1:00:18] and yet God is dealing with Noah and
[1:00:21] something is sparking in Noah's heart
[1:00:23] amen that is that is causing him to
[1:00:26] continue to preach for 120 years
[1:00:31] what about Abraham
[1:00:33] some things was working in Abraham God
[1:00:36] was working in Abraham amen dealing with
[1:00:38] his faith
[1:00:39] as he was waiting for that promise that
[1:00:42] God would had made to him amen same
[1:00:44] thing with Moses amen Moses had to have
[1:00:46] Egypt taken out of him before he could
[1:00:48] actually go and rescue them from Egypt
[1:00:50] the children of Israel you see so God is
[1:00:53] dealing with all these personalities
[1:00:55] amen and that's the same thing with you
[1:00:57] and I Saints
[1:00:59] it's not the dramatic events in our life
[1:01:01] and it's not a uh the the the the uh all
[1:01:05] the the the the trips to Bali and to
[1:01:08] into Italy if I could just make it to
[1:01:11] that trip of Italy amen I know I'll be
[1:01:14] happy in life
[1:01:15] that that vacation that I've always
[1:01:17] wanted to take down in Florida or or
[1:01:20] wherever
[1:01:21] I'll be happy I'll have joy
[1:01:24] or that car that you've always wanted or
[1:01:27] whatever I I know oh man when I can get
[1:01:30] a hold of that SUV or that car I know
[1:01:32] I'll be happy
[1:01:34] I mean if I'm I can pay for it and
[1:01:36] everything I I'll just be I'll be happy
[1:01:39] I've reached it then
[1:01:42] yeah it's not it's not that amen
[1:01:45] but it's what's God doing behind the
[1:01:47] scenes
[1:01:48] amen that causes the joy of the Lord
[1:01:51] amen in your life praise God
[1:01:55] praise the Lord Jesus
[1:01:58] so in life there there's times that we
[1:02:00] have times of quiet and peace and Times
[1:02:04] of loudness and drama
[1:02:08] what if every day was
[1:02:11] was dramatic in your life
[1:02:15] I don't know some of us could make it
[1:02:20] if it was like the The Barking
[1:02:21] Chihuahuas that I spoke about last time
[1:02:24] when I was preaching
[1:02:25] just constantly around you just barking
[1:02:27] barking barking barking
[1:02:29] drama in your life
[1:02:31] I mean you'd probably just
[1:02:35] some of us probably have that already
[1:02:37] but
[1:02:40] and God bless you you helped me to know
[1:02:42] what what the secret is to make it you
[1:02:44] know
[1:02:45] not that I have drama in life but
[1:02:47] sometimes it feels that way
[1:02:49] amen
[1:02:51] but what if everything was like that
[1:02:53] well let's just take it the other way
[1:02:55] what if every time every every time it
[1:02:58] was always just quiet
[1:03:00] and you didn't even hear a fly flying
[1:03:02] around you nothing
[1:03:05] what if it was always like that
[1:03:08] you'd want something different right
[1:03:11] but that's why God has given us these
[1:03:13] this balance
[1:03:15] of highs and and lows
[1:03:18] amen you need a balance of both and then
[1:03:22] but and in those situations amen God is
[1:03:24] molding our character
[1:03:26] praise God because because maybe God
[1:03:30] maybe you've you've had a week last week
[1:03:32] that it was dramatic I mean you got you
[1:03:36] know someone just ran right across and
[1:03:38] you they're at a red light and almost
[1:03:40] caused an accident and you slam on the
[1:03:43] brakes and fell over uh and landed up in
[1:03:46] a ditch but you missed that car
[1:03:48] and it made you nervous and I mean and
[1:03:50] you thought about that for the rest of
[1:03:51] the week I mean it was some drama in
[1:03:53] your life that day right
[1:03:57] and then this week it's just a total
[1:04:00] opposite nothing quiet
[1:04:03] peaceful
[1:04:05] you're enjoying that because you had
[1:04:08] that previous drama from last week right
[1:04:12] but what if God is actually sometimes in
[1:04:15] those ho-hum daily routines of life and
[1:04:18] and and and and and and
[1:04:20] these things that we're talking about
[1:04:22] what if God is just preparing you for
[1:04:24] something else that's getting ready to
[1:04:26] come
[1:04:28] and he needs you to quiet down settle
[1:04:30] down because he knows that something
[1:04:33] some more drama is going to come your
[1:04:35] way
[1:04:39] amen did you see how God does things
[1:04:42] and so we don't have to take it as oh my
[1:04:45] gosh what what are you doing I mean amen
[1:04:48] that's the balance of life
[1:04:50] we all need it
[1:04:52] now I think our young people too Amen
[1:04:55] in some way especially as teenagers when
[1:04:57] they're growing and they have these
[1:04:59] highs and these lows and there's all
[1:05:01] these changes the changes that are
[1:05:03] taking place why am I feeling this way
[1:05:05] but but then I feel depressed but then I
[1:05:07] feel so excited and and I just can't
[1:05:09] seem to get to bed and and I you know
[1:05:12] but then I'm
[1:05:15] I don't even want to be around my mom
[1:05:16] and dad and I don't
[1:05:19] and then but us as parents we think
[1:05:21] that's bothersome
[1:05:23] I'm getting down to the parents now
[1:05:25] because remember I'm still a parent and
[1:05:27] I'm dealing with I'm dealing with
[1:05:28] raising teenagers right now
[1:05:33] they need those those things
[1:05:36] they need those ups and those Downs
[1:05:39] because it's going to bring balance in
[1:05:41] their life
[1:05:42] amen because God is God is dealing with
[1:05:45] him you have to remember God gave them
[1:05:47] to you so that you can put give them
[1:05:48] back to him
[1:05:49] and that's what's happening amen
[1:05:52] don't don't get upset at them and scold
[1:05:54] them amen because they're they're
[1:05:56] thinking you they're thinking a certain
[1:05:58] way why in the where would you do that
[1:06:01] they're gonna make some dumb mistakes
[1:06:03] trust me they're gonna say some dumb
[1:06:06] things too
[1:06:07] they're gonna they're gonna I mean
[1:06:10] but I read scientifically their their
[1:06:12] brains are still are still being formed
[1:06:15] all the way up to the ages of 25.
[1:06:18] scientifically it's been proven
[1:06:21] so there from a baby down to 25 years up
[1:06:25] to 25 years old their brains are still
[1:06:27] formed so
[1:06:28] I don't know all the details of that you
[1:06:29] can go into 100 and research that but
[1:06:31] that to me that changed a lot of the way
[1:06:33] I think about how to deal with teenagers
[1:06:35] amen
[1:06:36] or young people see because it's not
[1:06:40] just a spiritual thing with them amen
[1:06:42] it's also a psychological thing or also
[1:06:45] a biological thing things are happening
[1:06:47] in their bodies you see that you went
[1:06:50] through nobody explained that to you but
[1:06:53] you think that they're ridiculous for
[1:06:54] acting the way you used to act
[1:06:57] Bridge
[1:06:59] that's the same way you used to act
[1:07:01] but you think it's ridiculous
[1:07:05] because your brain has already developed
[1:07:09] you're 40 50 60 years old
[1:07:14] and that's why we don't give these kids
[1:07:16] a chance
[1:07:18] praise God
[1:07:19] and you say Lord give me wisdom to be
[1:07:21] able to deal with my children the way
[1:07:24] you would do it
[1:07:25] to be the right parent the right father
[1:07:27] the right mother let me say the right
[1:07:30] things that would invite them to to come
[1:07:33] closer to you
[1:07:35] they may not do it right there and then
[1:07:37] but I promise you amen they're seeing
[1:07:41] and they're and they're they're they're
[1:07:42] they're taking these things in of the
[1:07:44] things that you do or don't do or say or
[1:07:46] don't say
[1:07:48] many times I've made mistakes I haven't
[1:07:50] said the right thing I haven't done the
[1:07:51] right thing but oftentimes I'm I'm I'm
[1:07:54] I'm I'm surprised that sometimes things
[1:07:58] that my daughters would tell me that
[1:07:59] they observed and I had no idea and I'm
[1:08:02] like you know what Lord thank you that
[1:08:03] you allowed me to do that so that they
[1:08:05] could see that
[1:08:07] amen
[1:08:09] so always be salty
[1:08:11] not just at church not just when you go
[1:08:13] to work but always be salty even before
[1:08:15] your children
[1:08:17] be salted before your your cousins be
[1:08:19] salted before your your everybody around
[1:08:22] you
[1:08:22] amen I know it's tough because we're
[1:08:25] living this mundane routine life I gotta
[1:08:29] get up in the morning and go to work and
[1:08:30] I don't feel like shaking people's hand
[1:08:32] at church
[1:08:35] I'm not already thinking about work
[1:08:37] tomorrow
[1:08:38] or about going to school I got to do
[1:08:40] homework and I just don't feel like it
[1:08:44] you know what
[1:08:46] there's many times that Jesus didn't
[1:08:47] feel like doing many things either
[1:08:52] but yet it's not about you
[1:08:55] it's about what you can do for others
[1:08:57] and how others can feel amen the the the
[1:09:00] things that you that the Impressions
[1:09:03] that you're making in people's lives
[1:09:04] amen
[1:09:07] so uh what so what what about these
[1:09:10] things that are they're leading up to to
[1:09:12] those moments amen the daily life what
[1:09:15] about those things because you're
[1:09:16] thinking you're thinking oh when I get
[1:09:18] that car when I finally find the right
[1:09:20] person to marry I'll just be happy and
[1:09:22] I'll find joy in that
[1:09:27] and that's very joyous and that's very a
[1:09:30] very happy thing
[1:09:31] but those of us that are married
[1:09:34] can say
[1:09:36] that's not fulfillment
[1:09:38] it fulfills but it's not the full
[1:09:41] fulfillment
[1:09:43] without Christ
[1:09:45] being in the picture
[1:09:47] it's a very happy thing it's a wonderful
[1:09:49] thing
[1:09:50] it's it's a
[1:09:52] it's a blessed thing
[1:09:54] but it's not the thing
[1:09:57] amen
[1:09:59] because things come and go amen but the
[1:10:02] joy of the Lord is our strength
[1:10:04] praise God so the bad times can happen
[1:10:07] and you got the joy of the Lord
[1:10:09] but the good times can happen and you
[1:10:12] got the same joy of the Lord you're
[1:10:14] settled in truth amen you're you're
[1:10:16] you're you're you're nothing nothing can
[1:10:19] move you because truth is what you're
[1:10:21] settled upon
[1:10:23] amen and that's what God I believe is
[1:10:25] trying to deal with us in this hour amen
[1:10:27] so how do we find the Lord in in the
[1:10:29] mundane and how do we find joy in the
[1:10:31] ordinary how do we find joy in in me
[1:10:34] scraping off the blueberries that dry
[1:10:36] blueberries off the off the the
[1:10:39] that bowl
[1:10:41] then my husband left the night before
[1:10:43] and he was eating blueberry pie and he
[1:10:45] just he forgot to put the the Water
[1:10:48] Rinse the bowl with water and and at
[1:10:50] least do that
[1:10:52] no he just put it there and then now
[1:10:54] it's all dried up and nasty
[1:10:57] don't you hate that
[1:10:58] and the sisters say
[1:11:00] [Laughter]
[1:11:03] hey man
[1:11:04] I hate that
[1:11:07] but
[1:11:09] but instead of you complaining
[1:11:11] I mean I'm just being practical you know
[1:11:13] that's just just I am instead of you
[1:11:16] complaining what about thinking okay I
[1:11:20] am doing this amen so that he can I'm
[1:11:25] blessing I'm going through this so that
[1:11:28] he can use that same Bowl again
[1:11:30] and it'll bless him to be able to use
[1:11:32] that same bowl for his cereal or for his
[1:11:35] pasta and he might do that again he'll
[1:11:38] just leave it in the dish in the sink
[1:11:41] and not rinse it out or anything like
[1:11:42] that but you know what
[1:11:45] I'm doing it for him
[1:11:47] I I'm living my life I'm I'm suffering
[1:11:52] for him
[1:11:53] because I love him
[1:11:56] I love him
[1:11:58] I I want you to look look what this uh
[1:12:00] this this really struck me this this
[1:12:03] quote
[1:12:04] by Mother Teresa you can think about
[1:12:06] whatever you think about Mother Teresa
[1:12:09] but this really struck me she said this
[1:12:11] she said wash the plate
[1:12:13] not because it's dirty
[1:12:16] nor because you're told to wash it
[1:12:20] but because you love the person who use
[1:12:22] it next
[1:12:25] I think to me that's striking
[1:12:28] I think if if we think that way that'll
[1:12:31] help us complain less about the chores
[1:12:34] that we have to do
[1:12:35] especially us as uh you know the younger
[1:12:38] ones
[1:12:39] have oftentimes told my my daughters
[1:12:42] that when you have to do something the
[1:12:44] Bible tells us to do it as unto the Lord
[1:12:48] right so if your husband has the Holy
[1:12:51] Ghost
[1:12:52] you're washing that dish
[1:12:54] you're doing it as unto the Lord
[1:12:57] because that is God walking around your
[1:12:59] house isn't it
[1:13:01] or how about the the brother amen you're
[1:13:04] fixing that deck for your wife
[1:13:08] my wife is looking at me like
[1:13:12] I don't want to do it
[1:13:16] but
[1:13:17] I'm doing it
[1:13:18] not really for myself but I know I got
[1:13:20] to do it but she wants to see a pretty
[1:13:23] deck she wants to say I'm doing it to
[1:13:25] please the Lord that that side of the
[1:13:27] Lord
[1:13:28] you see
[1:13:29] that I believe my wife has the Holy
[1:13:31] Ghost so I'm doing it for the Lord
[1:13:34] because that's what the Bible tells me
[1:13:36] to do
[1:13:38] right
[1:13:39] it'll help us less complaining and less
[1:13:41] grumbling amen and every time you fold
[1:13:44] that shirt every time you you you
[1:13:46] separate socks and you're trying to find
[1:13:49] the right sock after you do laundry and
[1:13:50] and all these different socks and I just
[1:13:52] can't find where's my other soccer and
[1:13:55] you end up and you had dropped it down
[1:13:56] there all the way down in the basement
[1:13:57] and you could
[1:13:59] you got to go pick it up and to pair it
[1:14:01] with this one amen but instead of
[1:14:03] complaining and grumbling and and
[1:14:05] thinking oh he's got
[1:14:08] I'm doing it as unto the Lord
[1:14:11] I'm doing it because I love my husband
[1:14:15] I'm doing it because I love my wife and
[1:14:16] I want him or I want my children to to
[1:14:20] have a pair of clean socks I want Jesus
[1:14:23] to have a pair of clean socks
[1:14:26] I think about it that way it makes us
[1:14:28] think things a little differently right
[1:14:31] so I thought that that was real striking
[1:14:33] that that quote amen
[1:14:35] don't do it don't watch the plate not
[1:14:36] because it's dirty not because you're
[1:14:38] told to wash it but because you love the
[1:14:40] person who use it next
[1:14:42] Colossians 3 23 tells us and whatsoever
[1:14:44] ye do do it heartily as of to the Lord
[1:14:47] yeah I fell in this many times
[1:14:50] sometimes we lose our vision about
[1:14:52] things and maybe things that we do here
[1:14:54] at church
[1:14:55] and we failed we failed to to to to to
[1:14:59] grab the whole picture and
[1:15:01] we think that it's just about that that
[1:15:03] shows us that the selfish selfishness
[1:15:06] sometimes in US
[1:15:08] amen
[1:15:11] do it heartily as unto the Lord heartily
[1:15:14] knowing that the Lord knowing that of
[1:15:17] the Lord ye shall receive the reward of
[1:15:20] The Inheritance and what is the
[1:15:21] inheritance is this Kingdom
[1:15:24] amen
[1:15:26] you will receive the benefits of the
[1:15:28] Holy Spirit you receive the bad that's
[1:15:29] the benefits of that Kingdom
[1:15:33] and folding some dirty clothes and some
[1:15:35] clean clothes and washing clothes and
[1:15:37] yeah
[1:15:39] because now you're doing you're thinking
[1:15:40] about the person and you're not thinking
[1:15:42] about the task you see praise God Amen
[1:15:46] hmm
[1:15:48] so this this should transform amen the
[1:15:51] way we we view our daily chores and and
[1:15:55] and it should challenge our perspective
[1:15:57] of of how we do things amen that's what
[1:16:00] I'm trying to do amen
[1:16:02] because sometimes we get caught up on
[1:16:04] hung up on on everything that I'm doing
[1:16:06] amen and and if any wanting is is
[1:16:09] noticing
[1:16:10] and no one notices what I'm doing
[1:16:13] but yet amen
[1:16:16] I read this verse I read this quote
[1:16:19] amen and it changes my perspective
[1:16:22] praise God that's one of the reasons why
[1:16:24] God put it there amen because it's not
[1:16:27] about you
[1:16:28] it's about God
[1:16:30] it's about the Lord amen so real quick
[1:16:33] amen I said I wasn't going to keep you
[1:16:34] guys but
[1:16:35] how to ensure you are manifesting the
[1:16:38] kingdom in every moment whether dull or
[1:16:41] exciting times amen
[1:16:43] three things amen
[1:16:45] we can handle three things right
[1:16:48] amen praise the Lord make sure that you
[1:16:51] are established in the truth
[1:16:54] amen make sure that that that that you
[1:16:57] are always involved in around truth
[1:17:00] and in this case it's the truth amen
[1:17:03] praise the Lord because that will help
[1:17:06] you and those that will help you during
[1:17:07] those times as I said earlier amen when
[1:17:09] things are not going right and or things
[1:17:10] are just normal every day type of I've
[1:17:13] got to go to do this that and then I
[1:17:15] know that amen that'll help you to
[1:17:17] always have a song in your heart
[1:17:20] amen
[1:17:21] always praising the Lord in your in your
[1:17:23] heart amen
[1:17:25] David said the joy of the Lord is my
[1:17:29] strength
[1:17:30] praise the Lord Jesus amen number two in
[1:17:34] mundane moments you see what the Lord
[1:17:37] wants you to learn or practice
[1:17:41] amen
[1:17:42] because patience contentment
[1:17:45] steadfastness Joy all these different
[1:17:47] things are not practiced in happy
[1:17:50] moments and dramatic type of events
[1:17:54] they're practicing the mundane routine
[1:17:56] daily type in and go in and out that's
[1:17:59] when those things are practiced
[1:18:01] that's when you can learn patience more
[1:18:06] and sometimes yeah we need you know a
[1:18:08] brother or sister says something to you
[1:18:10] amen and it just I want to say something
[1:18:13] back to them so bad
[1:18:16] that was a dramatic moment
[1:18:19] there's a moment of learning some
[1:18:21] patience there
[1:18:23] amen remember we're scaling up this this
[1:18:25] this this this this uh mountain right
[1:18:27] here
[1:18:28] praise God
[1:18:30] but it's in those times and you say Lord
[1:18:32] in those Quiet Moments you say Lord what
[1:18:34] is it that you're trying to teach me
[1:18:36] I I see nothing's going on in my life
[1:18:38] I'm just I'm going to work I'm coming
[1:18:40] home and
[1:18:42] what is it that you're trying to teach
[1:18:43] me praise God
[1:18:46] and number three amen work
[1:18:49] work
[1:18:50] because the Lord said so
[1:18:54] work do something be active
[1:18:58] maybe you stay busy
[1:19:00] amen find something to do
[1:19:03] because if you don't that's when the
[1:19:04] Satan comes in that's when the devil
[1:19:06] gets in he loves boredom
[1:19:10] oh he loves the board mind
[1:19:13] young people find something that that
[1:19:16] can grab your mind so that you're not in
[1:19:19] you know leaning over to the things of
[1:19:22] the world Amen but when you're when you
[1:19:24] have your mind busy on on things I'm not
[1:19:27] necessarily saying that you always have
[1:19:28] to sit and read your Bible amen find
[1:19:31] definitely find times to do that do it
[1:19:33] daily
[1:19:34] amen
[1:19:35] but do something Amen to keep your mind
[1:19:38] busy amen
[1:19:40] you know we're in the age of AI uh
[1:19:43] artificial intelligence for those who
[1:19:45] don't know then the next Gadget then and
[1:19:49] the artificial intelligence are trying
[1:19:50] to make us to work less
[1:19:53] and have more leisure
[1:19:55] have more Leisure and work less
[1:19:58] in reality we God asked us to work
[1:20:02] God asked us to use our brain God asked
[1:20:05] us amen but see all these other things
[1:20:08] are making us dumber and dumber and
[1:20:10] dumber and we don't even realize
[1:20:13] AI is heading the same direction as well
[1:20:16] now there's there's ways that AI can
[1:20:19] help I know that
[1:20:20] amen and they're trying to figure out
[1:20:22] I'm in at the school district where I
[1:20:24] work at they're trying to figure out
[1:20:25] because how can AI benefit the the
[1:20:28] children at school
[1:20:30] you know artificial and chat GTP and all
[1:20:32] these things
[1:20:33] where it's not just giving them answers
[1:20:35] or where it's not just amen but how can
[1:20:37] we use that that technology meant to
[1:20:40] actually help them to to know Amen to
[1:20:43] learn but you're not really honestly
[1:20:45] you're not going to win you're not gonna
[1:20:47] do uh there's nothing better than
[1:20:49] actually having one-on-one a teacher and
[1:20:52] some classroom and some and some and
[1:20:54] some classmates
[1:20:55] I mean that's the best that's what
[1:20:57] that's how God created us amen God
[1:21:00] didn't make us you know as as robots and
[1:21:02] and half human and half real but that's
[1:21:05] not God's intention that's the world's
[1:21:07] intention for us
[1:21:08] amen
[1:21:10] you you want to know what the world
[1:21:12] thinks of us or how they want us to be
[1:21:14] just go watch that movie from Disney
[1:21:16] that came out several years ago called
[1:21:17] Wally
[1:21:19] that's how they're trying to make us to
[1:21:21] be
[1:21:22] sitting around in chairs and just
[1:21:24] getting big and fat and Sassy
[1:21:28] and and with a screen right here in
[1:21:30] front of you and and it just does
[1:21:32] everything robots are doing everything
[1:21:33] for you and you're just sitting there
[1:21:35] and I mean you just go back and watch
[1:21:38] that movie they foretold exactly what
[1:21:40] they what they're thinking about today
[1:21:44] I wonder how anyways I'll get down to
[1:21:48] that
[1:21:49] but it is exactly what what they want
[1:21:53] for for you and me but that's not what
[1:21:55] God how God originally intended us to be
[1:21:57] so that's why the me personally I fight
[1:22:00] those things because it's not in in
[1:22:02] alignment with the word of God it's not
[1:22:04] in alignment with God's original thought
[1:22:07] amen it's great to have technology and
[1:22:10] to have but I'm not going to wear it all
[1:22:12] over me and I'm not going to have you
[1:22:14] know that's just not me
[1:22:16] because I like the original
[1:22:20] I like the original and if I can get
[1:22:22] more toward their original I just better
[1:22:25] for me anyways
[1:22:27] so make sure you're busy amen
[1:22:30] make sure you're busy so that the
[1:22:31] mundane amen doesn't seem so mundane
[1:22:33] praise the Lord Jesus brother Brown says
[1:22:36] this then our headship is a kingdom the
[1:22:39] kingdom of God is within you said the
[1:22:42] Bible Jesus the kingdom we are not a
[1:22:44] denomination we belong to a kingdom and
[1:22:47] the kingdom is the word of God made
[1:22:49] spirit and life in our own life
[1:22:53] amen praise the Lord Jesus that's the
[1:22:56] kingdom that's the the kingdom amen
[1:22:58] wants to be alive and active in your
[1:23:01] life amen even in the everyday ho-hum uh
[1:23:06] ways of life
[1:23:08] God already took up his Abode
[1:23:10] potentially the kingdom of God is in the
[1:23:13] earth now
[1:23:14] in the hearts of his Saints brother
[1:23:16] Branham says it's his attributes that he
[1:23:19] began in the beginning
[1:23:21] now his attributes is redeemed you and I
[1:23:25] amen
[1:23:27] what's he waiting to redeem the Earth to
[1:23:30] set his attributes on it to fulfill
[1:23:33] exactly his predestinated plan
[1:23:35] praise the Lord
[1:23:37] so God is working and and building the
[1:23:40] kingdom in you so that one day you can
[1:23:43] fully rule over this Kingdom this Earth
[1:23:47] with character
[1:23:49] because power without character is what
[1:23:53] satanic so if character is not be
[1:23:56] informed in You Now by the Holy Ghost
[1:23:58] through the mundane type of things that
[1:24:01] you go through every day amen you're not
[1:24:03] going to be able to rule there
[1:24:07] do you see what I'm saying that's why
[1:24:09] you need the ups and downs now
[1:24:11] because there it'll always be highs
[1:24:14] but you've already have gone through all
[1:24:16] the ups and downs
[1:24:17] and it'll just be worth it all then amen
[1:24:20] praise the Lord
[1:24:22] amen so Zachariah tells us and we're
[1:24:25] finishing with this amen Zechariah 4
[1:24:27] tells us then he answered and spake unto
[1:24:29] me saying this is the word of the Lord
[1:24:31] unto zerubel saying not by might nor by
[1:24:33] power but by my spirit said the Lord of
[1:24:36] hosts amen who art thou great Mountain
[1:24:39] before zerubbabel Thou shalt become a
[1:24:43] plane
[1:24:44] and he shall bring forth The Headstone
[1:24:46] thereof with shoutings
[1:24:48] crying Grace Grace amen
[1:24:52] I always like to say double Grace amen
[1:24:55] through through our ups and downs amen
[1:24:58] God is molding these virtues in our
[1:24:59] heart in our life
[1:25:01] amen through our mundane tasks of life
[1:25:06] it didn't take a shouting service to to
[1:25:08] give you knowledge
[1:25:10] and then take a a a a a a a shouting
[1:25:13] service to give you patience or it
[1:25:14] didn't take for a brother to just lay
[1:25:16] hands on you amen and you get godliness
[1:25:18] no it's through the daily routines of
[1:25:20] come in the church going to work dealing
[1:25:23] with people talking to people dealing
[1:25:25] with my wife dealing with my with my
[1:25:27] daughters dealing with your children
[1:25:28] cleaning dirty diapers amen folding the
[1:25:31] clothes amen doing all of that that's
[1:25:34] how you get all of it
[1:25:36] it's in the mundane things
[1:25:38] so we need those mundane things but you
[1:25:41] have you make the best of them
