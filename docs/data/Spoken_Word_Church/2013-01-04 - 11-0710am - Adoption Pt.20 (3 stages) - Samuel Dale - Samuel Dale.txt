also next weekend now brother keith brown will be here with us from florida to preach for us for the weekend so remember that and then remember wade will be preaching this afternoon trying to get these out of the way one side of my notes and then um we have a couple of testimonies and no we prayed there the other day for a little levi and you know the lord touched him and the doctors told him that they just need to take him off a lot of juices so that was that's they can tell you the rest of the story but you know and the lord would take care of everything so just keep praying for him it'll all clear out of his body and get everything in the right order and uh i know sister julie told me this morning about brother gary said it had a couple of houses with the roof off of them and the storms was coming up real bad and he just asked the lord to remove it and take it away and everything's all right so you know rain very little upon them so we believe god he's still in the healing business he's still in a delivering business he's still god we thank god for it you know for all of us doing so just remember all of these i think uh i've got all that let's wrap down remember those that are traveling so back some of the meetings and things they've been to and so remember these amen did i forget anything else i generally forget something but just remember those times you like turning your scriptures turn where we've been reading in ephesians 1 and then we'll be in romans 8 ephesians 1 and romans 8. father we thank you for this day and the hour that we're living we thank you because most of all without you what would there be anything we wouldn't even exist because we would not have no way to come without you bringing us into this world we love you and we thank you we cherish you lord and we ask you to just be with us today in your presence as we try to speak about you that you would bless each one lord that's here and those that are by way of internet and things that will be listening we pray that you would just bless each one and the hearts and lives of all the people because that's all we're trying to do is just talk about you and then let you lord make yourself manifest among us because that's what we're looking forward to we love you and we commit everything to you forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and guide us in your living grace in jesus name amen remember our wife's going for some testing all this week and uh thing that they're gonna have to do to inject some fluid into her back and i'll do is remember that and remember the things you know that god would be with each one of us ephesians 1 verse 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved all right go back turn to romans 8. i'm going to start reading it verse 5 down through about verse 13 then we'll pick up in a minute after we're seated and continue on with it verse 5 says for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they are that that but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if and the prophet said that's a question page 19 of the rise of the sun if it's dark right but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore in other words conclusion to it brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh we shall die but if we through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body we shall live you may be seated or that is blessing to the reading of the word now we'll be in romans there uh the message you're so after this i know and so just think on these things you know i'm talking about the romans that just read the scriptures there but see we tried to bring out a point this last wednesday that i hope you had an understanding of what i was trying to say and and everything and that you know people thinks that they're in the message and that makes them you know well we we prove we got the holy ghost we do this that or the other because we're in the message well could it be that we're just like the disciples were that was what i was trying to get across wednesday could it be that we could be like them because there in in luke it says that when jesus appeared among them that he opened their understanding of the scriptures right all right but you know that didn't give the new birth that didn't give them eternal life right that was opening their understanding of the scriptures in preparation for eternal life see in other words making a way or are defining what would have to take place and and how that these things would have to be and that he would have to be crucified and all of that and and give his life if not then we could not have you know eternal life so then you know that's that's the point i was trying to get to us that you know we could say well we've been in the message well oral roberts university has it and is there available for them the students to read so if they read what brother branham said then would it not be that their understanding would be open as to the end time see you know if you can read your understanding can be open but that does not give us eternal life it is not a revelation just because you're able to read to quote to uh the things you know that's not eternal life it's when the word is revealed amen unto us that's eternal life it's not just a quote it's not just you know a concept or a thought the prophet of god said i'm convinced we're not getting people to christ we're getting them to a church now he was it openly to admit that about himself he didn't say now what i'm thinking you're not being able to get them he said now we're not getting right see because he knew that the natural words of a man the the natural things of a man is not going to save us it takes a revelation from al almighty god all right now because we're talking about the stages of redemption and we've been on it now for quite a while this is message number 20 and uh we'll probably be on it 20 more so that's all millennium will take place we'll still be here but you know getting ready yeah but see what i want to do is to make sure you follow with me because we've gotten down to basically verse 23 of romans 8 and to talking about to whip the redemption of the body it doesn't say to redeem the body there it it cause that's not the point the point is is to understand to whip to understand the redemption of the body right all right and because if we don't understand the redemption of the body then thereby we will have to go by the grave you know and wait on someone else who can have that understanding and come to the position to bring us out of the grave by their understanding it's not going out to the graveyard and hollering and telling them to come on up i've never believed that you know i didn't believe that as a bad dish but let's see it's not that way but it's to understand how this body can be redeemed right you know and understanding it then see we can come to the position it can be we can quote all we want to it's already redeemed right i mean be sure we can give the quotes and we'll get through those things and read them but it's not redeemed until just like i said about the lord jesus his body was redeemed at the river jordan that's what your prophet said from this part of the earth the future home said i've redeemed this body and i'll come to live in it and said from that part i'll redeem the rest but it was three and a half years before he went into a change and i'll give you a key that he went into a change on the mount of transfiguration before he could go on to uh you might or look up some words around there of you know transfiguration translate glorify glorified i'm just giving you a little idea ahead of time you model to look those things up because we may be missing the point of uh of all of the scriptures and things what's being said because it's just like i'm saying here it doesn't say they're in romans the redemption of the body it says to understand the rejection of the body all right now it can only be understood by the revealed word right would you agree the lord jesus was the only one that understood the rejection of the body because even paul could speak of it but remember you can speak of things and even be god's word when paul said change them on twitter and i etc like that that was god's word but the man himself that said that never attained unto that position so that was waiting for you and i but somebody will have to to come to that place and we'll have to uh you know get there to the point but see now opening our understanding of the scriptures because i think after 40 years we've been at lula this past sunday was our 40th which is actually monday was their 40th uh years here in this church july 4 1971 we started and i believe after 40 years we ought to have a little bit of understanding open as i said the other day people would say beware of those who have you know beware of the man that thinks he's got all the answers tonight and i said well be aware of those people after 40 years and don't have any answers at all i mean that's that's you know well i'm just simple you know i just want to be simple well you can be simple and go by the grave but we can get a revelation and have a change of the bible now paul then is giving us understanding to about this redemption because it's got to come from the scriptures right all right so then as we read then now we'll come back to this on the 11th verse and all but we'll come back to see you know that this if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead be in you it'll quicken your mortal body all right we'll get back to that in a minute but i want you to do something with me let's just read the scriptures and go back and turn to romans there now and let's just start off and let's just read the scriptures because to me the scriptures have the answer we were talking about this at the bible study last night and uh see when you're reading the scriptures read the scriptures as uh you know what we've we've cut to a point i guess we call it we want to be so revelated until we read the bible searching for great mysteries and we read over the very simplicity of the mystery that god has revealed to looking for some kind of a mystery you know like uh the bible speaks of a stumbling stone a rock of offense right well you know that was the revelation of jesus christ exactly right but everybody wants to find this and find that and then brother branham's message they want to do this they want to read this and they just read well i've got a quote what is the quote saying right i could take the bible and do like the prophet said maybe he could read the bible and show you go judas went and hung yourself turn over a couple of verses and read go you do likewise you know well i told you the bible right let's see that was you know self-interpretation right upon wording but read the bible and see what the text is in we were talking about life not just as an example talking about hatred or hate which is works of the flesh that we've been on all right and see to take the word hate and run it across it's a big old word but you keep dropping down in the understanding of it and you'll find out that god hates sin right right but he don't hate the sinner so then you gotta break that down as to coming from our word hate and dropping it down to see that god can hate and you can hate sin or you can hate this that or the other and it not be scripturally wrong but it's according to your understanding so then you've got to go in and read what it's talking about and i was illustrating to them last night you go look it up in your strong's concordance that the word spirit where it's like re you know you're reading like in you see spirit they they don't give you a difference between the word from spirit speaking of holy spirit than they do from the word spirit speaking of man's spirit it's just using the word spirit all right and see then doing it you must read the before and the after to see whether it's talking about the holy spirit or man's spirit but the bible's got its own answer right you know and we just read the before and after part of it and we can understand so let's just read now see paul is putting the things in and we we've got down to our this past wednesday and a little bit the sunday evening i think it was or the wednesday before i forget when i preached a lot of times but we had got down to talking about the scripture in romans 8 30 that those who he justified he had already glorified right all right now what i want you to do is think with me as we read we're going to read from verse 20 where we'll start verse 14 to save time but no let's drop back to verse 11 in romans and let's read all the way over to verse 30 or 31 right along in there all right see because paul if he's going to tell you about the to wit you know the redemption of the body in other words we need an understanding paul is saying right we need an adoption we need a bringing forth of god to the position that we can have a man of transfiguration experience within our hearts and lives that will bring us to the full opening of the word right and a full understanding because brother brown covers matthew 17 you know and how that even thou represented moses and elijah and the things that was represented and then seeing jesus glorified but in doing it see paul speaks we can talk about how justified he's already glorified but see what i want you to see is how that's done well what do you mean it's just this is just done it's just no there has to be a way for it to be done and you know so say these notes if i don't get through with them i'll pick it back up wednesday night i mean the quotes i'm giving you all right let's just start in verse because we just read down through what it's talking about to be carnally minded if you yield to the flesh then you know it would be wrong but let's start with verse 11 and just read it and just make a few comments as we go along and remember my point when paul finishes it up talking about glorified he has explained to us the understanding or giving us the understanding of how this adoption to wit is going to take place now see that's the way you need to read the bible read it to get an understanding out of it but don't read it to try to figure it out because if you try to figure it out you're going to get further away just read what it says and let god tell you what it says amen and then you don't have to change it right see you can read it for yourself that way because that's the way i read all right verse 10 and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is light because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies how by his spirit that dwelleth in you this is not an exterior thing right right you know this is not an anointing to fall down from somewhere right that is to bring these things the anointing is supposed to be within you amen if you have the spirit of christ that's why the prophet said rise in the sun there's a question if you have it right if you have the spirit of christ it can quicken your mortal body all right see what therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for we live after the flesh for if ye live after the flesh he shall die much but he threw the spirit the inward man not as i said now just an anointing falling down from the inward man must come forth something that will be able to mortify the deeds of the body if it does we can live right from the inside out i gave you some quotes we'll get to it after a while your resurrection is inside of you all right see then it's from the inside out that things take place all right now what's he saying for as many verse 14 as they're led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god they and they only the original city for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry out by the father now there is the stage one we've been talking about there's the new birth amen that's what he's saying over here if the spirit of christ be in you then he gets to verse 13 and he's still on that point that it's got to be the spirit that is within you if the spirit is within you then it can mortify or die make to die the deeds of the flesh you know the body of mankind and now he's telling you how this being done what by the spirit that is within you for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry out by father now watch the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that what that we are the children of god right right by the new birth right we are the children of god amen that's right now he's not talking about human fleshly right right human flesh live with our children of the world and they're really the children of the devil right people don't like that you know they think there's a body so great and glorious but just remember it ain't worth nothing all right so what does he say verse 16 the spirit now that's holy spirit why because it's referring not just because it's spelled with a capital point but because it's referring to the point of where it's at the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirits all right now what that we are the children of god and his children look at the position the newborn baby comes into and his children then heirs heirs of god now what do you get from god eternal life right eternal life heirs of god you get eternal life see and join ours with christ now what does that mean and join ours with christ whatever he inherits we inherit all right you say yeah but he was god i agree with you he was god and that's the point of it if we're the children of god we can only be the children of god by the spirit of god that came from jesus christ and his crucifixion all right see then we're joint heirs not of just eternal life the bible says that we're out of all things right i've listened to the book of revelation where we're heir of all things all right now if we're out of all things in this world and all the other things it's not just a spiritual new word there we're heir of all things what by being joined ours with christ what did he do he came down and inherited this world because he came out of this world you agree to the son of man came out of this earth the body and that way then he'll always have the connection to this body you know this earth and the things i get the point now i i'm wanting to get down but it's hard to do without and if children do the heirs of god and join heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together amen amen have you ever looked up i'm giving you an assignment okay have you ever looked up glorified i don't need to look back i know what it is all right what is it he is not talking about your mortal being your mortal being is involved right so i'd go home and look up glorified and why you had it look up trends transfigured translated uh look these words up you might find some interesting things that we'll begin to discuss about it okay because remember we are still here that's my point okay we're still here we can read that we're already glorified you see it may take don't tell us how many years for that to take place to bring us into an immortal body right amen and there's a lot of stages between here and there so look at that okay see because i wrote it like this what i want us to notice is the point paul's saying we're already glorified in verse 30 there you know 8 and 30. but he's showing us that the the understanding in verse 23 of to wit the understanding of the adoption is what's going to bring us to the state of complete glorification all right so now that's what we're trying to read all right verse 18. for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god waiting for the sons and daughters of god to make god manifest right because how did we cover it manifest is to make known we are to make god known by preaching the gospel telling people about jesus christ witnessing etc and then what does he do he makes us known right by signs and wonders and things like that right so then we need to read that and get the understanding see making known to the sons of god for the creature now that's whole creation everything was made subject to vanity in other words put under the fall right not willingly see not of its own but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope in hope the world has a hope the animals have a hope the trees the creation has a hope right that's it all right and if they can see and they saw it for a moment in the manifestation of the prophet of god in our day now the lord jesus manifested in fullness but in our prophet in the last days with the storms et cetera the things nature saw its master because that's what we're supposed to be to speak a storm out of existence right it shows that those things are back into being for the sick to be healed shows those things are dire all right now watch them see but now remember it only brings the world and the creation to a hope which is an expectation of fulfillment you know basically at a later time would be the best definition of hope in other words i hope all right now watch we get them down in just a minute and what's that word so that's that's the creation which might subject to vanity not willing to but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope me all right because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the glorious bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god that's why it brings a hope to the world right look at all the earthquakes and the things are around the world don't you think the world is like you know uh would like to be delivered amen for we know that the whole creation growth and travail everything groaning and travailing mankind the world etc creation in pain together until now now bring that now on over here because he's prophesying bringing it down so it's down to where we are now all right i like the way brother brown says christ the mystery of god revealed he said to see how this is unfolded that step down into this present hour you know he brought it right down to where we're living all right what's now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body waiting paul is saying that he's waiting he's saying i'm not dire i'm not at that point right to fully understand i've even spoken of it in the spirit you know change them on twinkle 9 all of this and the other he's even told us how it would be that the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the voice of an archangel that was great that's a revelation to the prophet you know paul but he never reached it right he had to go by the grave see because he knew that something was going to happen like brother rather said he was trying to get us to see that god wasn't coming then that's what paul was doing see we thought paul was saying oh you'll be here in 15 minutes and i get to preaching no he was trying to get it out of her of the minds of people that he was coming there there would have to be things of falling away that have to be all kind of things would transpire before it could make it into the finality all right now listen people what's it doing even our our sales grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body now paul wanted the redemption of the body he prophesied of the redemption of the body but he never experienced the redeeming of the body right he could say it by spirit that we're already glorified he could tell us how it would transpire to change the moment twinkle line the lord said he could tell us all those things but he never achieved that position right so then that means somebody's going to have to reach that place right right amen and paul is laying there brother dick talks about it in hebrews 11 40 i guess it is where they without us cannot be made perfect they're waiting on us right amen what they said was reality but they're waiting on us whatever anybody would think about brother branham coming back to resurrection and preaching and all that it's still dependent upon the people of god to get that back here that's right amen because if not what is the dependence that's right see then when he comes back he can preach all he wants to do without 30 40 days we know as i sit there and look at what the lord resurrection no no no it's not going to be that way right but that's all right now watch then after he says this now that he's waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of the body look what paul says for we are saved by hope right now paul didn't say but i hope i'm saved now that's not to understand it all right this hope is not the understanding of the verse up above there that we stopped and identified on verse 20 that the whole creation was subject to the same in hope the world only has a hope of being changed that's right all right but we better have more than a hope listen because he explains that for we are saved by hope not hoping he's saved watching but hope that is seen is not hope what is hope that is saying faith right right faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen faith is not hope that's right paul explains that see watching for we are saved by hope but hope that his scene is not saved for what a man sees what did he yet hope for it brother said why would i want a shirt i've got one he said that's a scientific fact that i have on a shirt see this is where he's getting it from that's what paul's saying we start out as people in the gospel of hearing about jesus christ we hear about eternal life we hear about uh the change of glorification we hear about all of the things you know what that does that brings a hope to you right right because it puts us with the rest of the world but once that is made in revelation you're no longer hoping for it right if you have eternal life you're not hoping for eternal life that's right it's already a reality that's what he's saying for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man see it why did he yet hope for it listen but if we hope for that we see not now right paul by the understanding from the scriptures and the revelation had a revelation of the change of faith the substance but you know what at that point of time it has only brought a hope of reality into him now more than than i'm saved hoping i'm going to be changed right paul would say i hope i'm going to be changed after he doesn't sing the change it just brought a reality of life that one day this will take place but while i'm still here i'm having to wait i'm having to wait all right do you understand what he's saying but if we hope for that we see not know what then do we with patience wait for it this message has brought a hulk to you and i yes now come on you know that we basically believed before the prophet came that we were going to get a new body right all right so through the opening of the understanding of the scriptures by way of the prophet messenger we ought to at least come to hope and brother adam will say it like that he said you mean there's a hope for a change of these bodies he's not just hoping right he's saying right paul is not hoping he's saying what i've seen by revelation right right will one day have to come into reality because i've got the substance right that's right there's where we got to come to see to wit to understand to have a revelation not to just have an intellectual concept or a thought of of the redemption of the body but it's like i've told you then how come my lord half of the people this message probably still believes gonna get a new body after all the prophets said in the bible saying well you can see that it didn't get a hole well i guess that's what excuse me they got a hole they gotta hope they don't have a salvation they don't have a reality so all they've got is a hope but see why would i hope for a pair of glasses i've got them in my hand right i can see it why do i hope for it what do i desire for i've got it better see i already have the thing in reality and one day when we're changed we will then have in reality right what has been a hope within us brought by the revelation of the scriptures it's like the lord jesus said for three and a half years he was the revelation amen but his dependence was upon the scripture right amen brother brown said he died on the cross believing in one scripture not leave his soul in hell or suffer my holy one to seek reduction he believed that but he was waiting for it to be translated you know we're taking place he had went through a matter of transfiguration experience of showing pure glorification joining glorified right but yet hanging there or being beat how do you think he felt right don't think he felt now when they get to beating me i'm i'm gonna be glorified i don't know i don't quite think that away folks i don't think you and i would do it right he was going through pain and agony but he had to because that was the word amen that had to be fulfilled see we we've got scriptures i tried to preach that remember a few weeks or months or so ago that there's a word for each age we've got scriptures for this age that we must fulfill because all scriptures got to be fulfilled i don't agree with the man you know what said him and bill was talking and said they're talking about scriptures it wouldn't even be fulfilled well i i can't go along with that i don't care what the man says or what he thought brother ryan said i got too much where brother brown said all the scriptures got to be fulfilled i just can't go that way you know maybe he heard something but he didn't hear the right way right but listen so paul says why would i hope for something if i see it right but until i see that until i see it i can see it now by revelation changing them on the twinkling of an eye and see how it's done the lord himself feel the sin i can see all of those things but it brings me to a hope of reality not a hope right raise the word hope i see above from the point amen he had a revelation about the change but the change is not transpired we can have a revelation of the change but until the the revelation is transpired and we are changed it brings us to a hope right i hope there is more than i hope i'm going to be changed it's a reality but it's a fact that you can't see it that's right amen you say i see it by faith that's true you're healing my stretch i'm healed it's revealed to you it may be a long time before it's a reality because that's where you're coming back then to a hope of that not a hope i'm saying hope i'm healed no get the point there has to be somewhere in between their understanding of a word that is to be brought to the basis that we can actually what we've seen in the in the prophet's message brings that hope to you and i of a change of reality through the opening of the word all right now watch what he says now he's laying his background and get what i'm saying they lay in his background to be able to say something all right so he goes through that it's not hope if it you can see it it's not hope but if until you see it it's still hanging on to something aren't watching likewise in other words exactly like or this is what it is the verse 26 likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities right amen but how am i going to get from what i've said about the change to a reality of the change now how am i going to get there because there's a vast gap between the two that's right so watch what he says he said the spirit there's the key that's in you you know it'll change your mortal body the spirit also helped with their infirmities when jesus was in the garden yielding himself over and finally come to the position it says the angels come and minister them to it that's right when he was out in the wilderness you know am i not in the desert forty days and forty nights that said the angels come and minister to them see the spirit helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought good pointing the spirit's one's gonna take care of things for we know not what we should pray for as we all but the spirit itself makes intercession for us with drawings which cannot be uttered that's not speaking in tongues because these are things that cannot be uttered right and you've got known and unknown tongues but these are things that cannot be uttered have you ever been to the place to work that you were so burdened about something and it just you know you're just so burdened and so heavily burdened about someone that's sick or or something or like brother gary burdened about the fact that there's two roofs out there that's off of the house see and you need to be fixed before it rains right see all right then what do you do you pray right and then the spirit says all is willing so he goes and tells his helpers their word and then tells his efforts julian told me he said it'll be all right have you ever been that away amen you ever been to the place that had finally just come to a sweet peace you just said all as well i don't care how god does it all as well i mean he can put a funnel down and hang plastic out of heaven if he wants to and cover the two houses whatever he wants to do right but see we don't think about that as being the fulfillment which all that would you know some well it's like the kids you know that wanted the mountain to be moved because they were sick and everything and they asked the lady and they said well yeah we could pray and they went out and prayed well it didn't work too good and they go get their little buckets and they move a little bit well it still didn't work too good but you know what happened one day they come in there and said we're going to build a highway right down through here and said to do that we're going to move that hill out of the way well you know what i was going to do it he hurt him little kid that's right it was his way of taking care of him he blasts the whole thing away or he can send somebody to move the thing see whatever he wants to do but listen to all right i keep doing that won't get on what i want to and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind he knows whether our spirit is right or not he knows whether our intention is right right exactly he said why we told us somebody there one time why you want to be healed where you can go back to the world we were talking about it last night you know that brother around and told those people they were oil well drillers and he told those people he said i know where the oil is they said well tell us we'll drill it we'll give them money we'll donate it all we'll do this out of the other something like this no no you wouldn't tell them they drilled and didn't get but just little things you know he said then here comes somebody alone had nothing to do with any of it sets down one all well and his sculpture he said i knew where today let's see what he knew also that their intentions oh yeah we'll donate it all but he knew they're gonna slide a little back and you know something you know okay go ahead and he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god now god's will is his word okay trying to get rid of and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are they called according to his purpose now here he is right in the middle of expressing the understanding of the redemption and he's telling you how it's to take place and right in the middle of it he looks like he's just losing the whole thing and lost his whole point and start talking about you know well according to his with purpose listen for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed now to be and conformed both are future tense points see that's why that everybody looks back and say i'm already this i'm already this that's in god's mind i'm already glorified that's in god's mind but there is a to be conformed down that's here there's a place here that we've got to reach what he has already said we'd reach you agree see we look at it well i'm already glorified look danny said as a man told him it works and well i don't never see him i don't see him daily like people say he's trying to make a point and there is a truth to what the man would be saying but it's not the truth i'm going to say it this way because one thing he's not in this message so he wouldn't know any way to get to the truth the other would be a point that he's just making a statement because of of what he's wanting to take place but there is a truth that we don't sin but then the truth is that we sin every day that's right amen right right that's what paul's expressing through here life and doings and saying thee all right for what for whom he did for no that was before he also did predestinate looking to the future to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren now watch after all that's doing paul how are we going to get this to understand the redemption of the body moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called then he also justified in whom he justified then he also glorified amen now that is god saying what he sees about you and i that's right amen he sees us already glorified but if we don't go through the stages in the correct order of understanding in other words we must go through justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost to have eternal life for the spirit of god to be dwelling inside of us other than that it's an anointing upon amen justification and sanctification is a washing and cleansing but it's the anointing is basically upon you as an outward part but then when it becomes into the soul by the new birth then you have eternal life then and only then can you start thinking about glorification right agreed yeah but i believe everybody no everybody ain't going to be there that's right only those that are are true are going to be there only those that are born again are going to be there we wish that it would be for everybody but if if they don't have it and if we have eternal life today we will prove whether or not we have eternal life because we'll come to the message of the hour right amen if we don't come to the message hour we differ with it and we prove we don't have eternal life but we're just anointed with things but see look what paul is saying paul how am i going to come to an understanding for this the understanding i want the understanding paul of what's going to be of the redemption of my body and he says are you born again he said yes i'm born again he said are you going through the stages of adoption and only this age can go through those things right he said do you really believe the word then your redemption lies within you amen it's in christ that is within you all right and by being in christ then our glorification is already within sight of us waiting to a time to be brought into reality we said i want to tell you so let's bring that if over from verse 11 because the prophet emphasizes faith 19 it's a rising sun he said see he put a question there if the spirit of christ be in you so let's bring that over now and let's bring the new birth into being and then we'll face romans 8 31 30. those who he justified now it doesn't say there to listen it doesn't say there those we justified he's sanctified knows he's sanctified he's already glorified because see that's not what you're talking about right you're talking about the new birth paul is not preaching the new birth in those verses he's preaching to christians that are born again if the spirit of god be in you it will quicken your mortal body right how paul well it's going to come because see verse 11 it's going to come because verse 23 someone is going to reach the understanding of how this redemption of the body can transpire and said it's because that we can believe what god says all right so it says those who he justified now we go all the way to the invisible union right you know people out there might not understand this oil back up i heard but see invisible union brother branham covers justification but if you read the book real carefully covers it in three stages amen because you must be justified as chopping off your past sin and then there is a daily walk in god unlike your disciples taught a daily sanctification etc there is a justification in a walk in life and then it comes to a time that see it's real you never done it right because the first is chopping off what you've done the second is coming to a reality listen to the read the book of this says dog you've never done it you got it it says though you've never done it when you say this though you've never done it that means you've done it right but something has been erased amen but because of time when you realize as john says over in in the little john's that his seed remain within us and we cannot sin that's right we cannot disbelieve god's word right but as long as we're in these mortal bodies the prophet said we'll be a sticker until we're changed now that don't mean well bless god the prophet said it so i got to be a sticker now that's not what he said you do that you prove you're lost right right that plain language yes i know brother dale's pretty strong sometimes when he says thing but i think it's time to say it strong let's quit propping up hitting the devil if you get those ideas in your mind it's okay for you to go out and do this out the other because you're already saved you're lost you need a baptism of the holy ghost and i agree with one brother said we need a baptism in our mind and i wish to god he would baptize our human minds with the holy spirit to wash it and cleanse it amen but you understand what we're saying those who he justified not just coming into the body not just chopping off your sins that's not the the situation that paul did he's talking to people that are already born again he's gonna explain it to us that's right he's uncovered the spirit being in us he doesn't cover the adoption he doesn't cover the likewise the spirit helpeth our infirmity he's uncovering the new birth and when it comes down to reality he says it like this he says more with whom he predestinated now you know what your prophet said about it that's why i kept reading that in ephesians this is the only age that's predestinated unto the adoption to bring forth the change right right so then he's talking about those who he predestinated he's not talking about just predestination as a a fact of throwing things out and this is where it's going to be he's talking about predestinating to an age in a time of understanding right that's right and he says those who predestinated he called him and whom he called he justified brought him into the body set him in a place and those whom he justified them he also glorified pisces right already done your prophet would emphasize that i gave you a bunch of quotes on the notes and that but what is it look at his conclusion then what shall we say then to these things i've got a lot of uh let's see how many have gotten that i wish you'd mark them sometime and go down through there and look how many questions was asked verse 31 ends with a question 32 ends with a question 34 has a question in it 35 ends with a question i circled in on little things because the question is that it means it's asking a simple question what shall we say then to these things question what do we say to this if god be for us who can be against us what shall we say then to these things if god be for us who can be against it he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all thanks question who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect question it is god that justifies who is he that condemneth question it is christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who may who also make a conversation for us and you're going down through our reading but listen see paul is explaining in the scriptures now see that's the way that i look at scriptures and that's the way i read them i i read them if paul is saying something or somebody's saying something about or brother branham i like to read where like brother brown what is the new birth i like that because you you're going to have to take what i'm saying if you don't look go through the books and read them a lot of times people ask brother branham questions and sometimes it looks like he doesn't even get the question because he doesn't bluntly answer and for some reason i don't know why but you you read the book and say you get into questions and answers when they'll ask him a question about something and he seems to make two or three words about the answer he goes off to something else i don't know whether it's the holy spirit doing it i don't know but i've known that a long time i've always told you about it but when he says there what christmas your god revealed what is the new birth then brother brown he says the revelation of jesus christ personally to you he answers the question paul you said that we're waiting to with the redemption of the body how's that going to be done when a revelation comes to you that you're standing here getting older sicker right not if we want to it just automatically comes with it that's what i tell everybody i don't get up every day saying well i don't know i'm getting older i'm from no i don't do that i just get up every day knowing i'm 71. and if i get to be 72 i'll have more pains because that's no normal life right well now brother dallas people there to be not yeah but they 99.99 don't live that long so now what's your argument right but listen paul is telling us you're going to have to get to revelation well we'll get rid of will i i want my background no no no no it's not you're gonna have to get to revelation you're just as eternal as god is by the new birth you're going to have to get the revelation that you're justified in the basis that the real you which is the new birth inside of you never did do it and then you'll realize as we were bringing out the other day in the messenger that the the prophet said we need a revelation where it says that we're just as righteous as god he is because that's what his mind is and then you've got to realize realization of a revelation that we're already glorified now that's just an insert to try to help you maybe a message point to try to help you understand the way i look at things and the way i study them out to to reach a conclusion and come to you and try to preach then with it with a you know with the point of driving it hard see we must have a revelation of redemption before the redemption can transpire that's what i said there the other day that i thought when i say this point that that when god gave you the new birth that he redeemed your body i thought everybody would start screaming glory hallelujah he said well brother i've heard you say that before yeah i said that before because i preached something but you know sometimes it becomes a revelation amen maybe it took all the years though my understanding it's all right we'll see a revelation comes see when a revelation comes in you don't have no problems with the rest of the scriptures it'll all fit you don't have to deny any parts or run anything backwards and so when god gave you the new birth right there he redeemed that body amen just as when he gave the holy ghost came on jesus that he didn't need a new birth but it came on him as an example or a ministry or an anointing but when it did it redeemed that body but it was three and a half years of horrible life before he come to the point of being changed amen all right difficult periods he went through amen but yet he came to the point so what does it matter if you receive the holy ghost when you're eight nine ten years old and you're seventy right that's right amen right there's where god claimed that body when he gave you the new birth that's right see look what he says let's get one or two the quotes and then we'll do it number one on your notes which is actually progress 76 question 107 questions and answers 54 54 103 the morning service those whom he called he justified those whom he justified he glorified and ever redeemed person in the world this morning that's under the blood of jesus christ filled with the holy ghost happy everlasting life and can't perish and is already in heavenly places with jesus with christ jesus and shall never come into condemnation already redeemed isn't that wonderful see already redeemed sitting in heavenly places with christ and glory already glorified already glorified you say brother bill does the scripture say that jesus said that or the scripture said that are the writers paul he said those whom he justified he hath already glorified those whom he ordained he predestinated those whom he predestinated he justified those whom he justified he has already glorified what is it oh my excuse me already glorified then if we are filled with the holy ghost our fathers and beings had already been preserved in god there is a glorified body already waiting and you have to go to it as soon as this is over those who he justified he's already glorified preserved in god all right i gave you a bunch of quotes the brother brown said everything you need was in you when you received a new birth all you got to do is keep pushing out expectations 1953. 507. all you got to do is just keep pushing now because everything in the journey of this whole life is in you right well i don't need nothing else then i just go sit down no that wasn't what paul said in romans that's not what any christian would say the prophet said keep eating pushing out everything you have need of is in god all right number four you're going down you've got to use faith in god which is faith 1961 813 so you've got your own resurrection inside of you so where's the resurrection inside of you all right what is the next one true easter seal 1961 402 but we were resurrected from the inside out not from the outside in that's why that i don't beat on bodies don't beat nobody they're going to change the inside i try to preach to your soul if the soul gets right your body will follow it come on i believe that we are resurrected from the inside out not from the outside in oh do you notice not sealed out this way but sealed in oh my if the church could just see it see we're not sealed out we're sealed in if the church could just see this thing so then i gave you a bunch to worry that it covers it like for this is for the type of services or anybody else faith 1956 we're brought around to talk about uh the past tense form of already glorified during romans past tense four hebrews chapter seven part one uh jehovah jireh part 61 226 it's past tense where he said already justified he's already glorified all that's past tense see because it's in god all right because it makes sure you're somewhere else questions and answers 54 103 the evening what you are here get this in your mind now i'm going to close but what you are here is a sign that you are something else somewhere you've always wanted to be in perfection you christians there is a perfection and that perfection is not in this life but every man and woman here that is a christian every person that is a christian here now is already glorified in the presence of jesus christ and you've got another body you won't have some time some other time you have right now right now there's another body waiting for you if this one should perish could you think of that study on that just a moment i told you the biggest portion of the quotes you'll find brother branham is referring to the theophany right that you have another body right now all right we got to get to that so we get to it it's referring to that because without that you cannot get it together right all right so now what he says okay let's just quote these couple and then we'll get through future home 1964 802 number 10 on you know he's talking about your soul being a part of god your attribute of god etc he's talking about that the body's to be redeemed the soul's already redeemed uh you're displayed here in the body the body's to be redeemed now the soul's redeemed because it was in sin so god came come down by process of justification sanctity and baptism of the holy ghost and redeem your soul and you par you being part of the earth it's redeemed by it see the earth and time you're in the process now it's growing on right seeing any coverage on down to the future home that throws part of part of it's made his body and he come to redeem that and from that he'll redeem your body then we've used this from before but who is this melchizedek 65 221 the evening service it's the earnest of the resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already started it was once now here's where we'll get back to a message it was once subject to sin and minor and corruption but now it's got the earnest it's turned heavenly now that's the earnest of you that you're going in the rapture it's the earnest all right the others hold on to the wednesday so they'll be quickening the quickening power of almighty god you see your resurrection is inside of you your eternal life is inside of you your glorification is inside of you working outwardly into this outward part and when we get to revelation inside not the brain the head the soul when we get to revelation that we are just as eternal as he is we'll be made eternal in flesh until that time we remain in fleshly forms whether it be another 40 years or whatever it be we remind that until the revelation comes but it's already in the bible and the prophet's message we're not looking for somebody to drop out of space to bring us an illegal alien to jump down out of space and tell us all about eternal life no no i'm not looking for something like that it's the message of the hour the prophet said our body is growing on he said it's already started he said god lay claim amen god laid claim to these bodies the day he gave you the new birth we just got to let it be transmitted from the inside outwardly and it's the same thing as your healing you get a revelation that you're healed it's a revelation it's dark not hope it's a revelation then once it's made a revelation then you must walk on the end of the basis of it coming into reality all right see because hope is not faith if you're just hoping but why do you hope for what you have it's a revelation do we have a revelation of the rejection of the body come on bro see that's right that it's not the body that we're i'm not concerned about this body being changed i must get first the revelation that it's changed right that's right and then when the revelation that has changed then it will have to come into reality and see you can talk to people that have been healed see but people have never been healed there's a lot of people that's never been healed instantly so you there's no way you can explain healing to them it takes god to drop down but it's somebody that's been healed i mean being healed right there or seen something take place right there then you can say look this is just more of that that's right the change of these bodies is gonna come because somebody gets a revelation right what not that they're going to be changed but they the day god gave them eternalizing their soul he laid claim on that body to bring that body to the place that you're not going to get another one right so your redemption started right there that's right of the body just like jesus for three and a half years what do you think about it see that's just the way i just thought of sitting there yesterday and i had a lot of troubles trying to get together how to bring what i want to and i thought i'll just do that i'll just explain the scripture says it that paul covering right through the scriptures and he comes right down to the state of showing us that we're glorified in the presence of almighty god and we must get to revelation that we're glorified and then we can be glorified right but i'll say it again because maybe it'll stir your curiosity i would look up glory glorified translation transfigured and with those words left i don't know whether i'll get to the next message or not but i just i want you to look up things look of everything you can find the prophet said about glorification or glorified studied i thought we were supposed to be studying the message i thought we believed it was in the message well then we're reading griers almanac or the newspaper to find the message now i'll get people to tell you more about bruce dominic in the in the newspaper they can tell you about brothers message why after 40 years come on something's wrong with us mentality i mean that's i'm sorry this thing something's wrong when people don't know what brother brown has talked about i didn't ask you where's it revealed i said do you know what it's taught how many times have you ever read a message well i read that message i don't need to read that anymore i heard that i'd advise you to go back and read some you look more a lot of my books you'll find they're marked with red they're marked with black they're marked with blue they're marked with green they're marked with all different kind of colors and a lot of that you can't hardly read the words because it's many marks but that means that's how many different times i've read it because i used a different colored pencil but yet we claim to be going out of here and we have the message in our hands but we're not if we don't get a revelation of the change we're going by the grave i've told you that over and over we're going by the grave we're going to have to die why because it's going to take a revelation to be changed it takes a revelation to be healed it takes a revelation to be saved why wouldn't we tell you that it takes a revelation to be changed all right amen but do we seek a revelation go ahead 539 inspire me anybody have a need 5 39. within me my holy spirit he said god restored your salvation within me from is me crazy from restore unto me thank you
