[14:12] Bible but there's some things that we're
[14:13] going to look at when we get into the
[14:16] church
[14:17] ages and U as we were talking this
[14:22] morning remember one
[14:25] thing the
[14:27] Saints would judge the
[14:31] Earth judgment we know was paid for at
[14:35] Calvary he took the Judgment of us all
[14:39] at Calvary
[14:40] right but tell you what one person saved
[14:43] at Calvary at that moment
[14:47] nope they ran from him he died alone the
[14:51] Bible says he died by itself the thief
[14:54] at the cross was the only one close
[14:56] enough to him to receive receive eternal
[15:00] life and he wasn't
[15:03] bride right but he was waiting on a
[15:06] bride to come and he gave every bit of
[15:09] that St John 17 that's why I said that's
[15:11] to me that's the Lord's Prayer to his
[15:13] bride Lord that they may be one as we
[15:15] are one all right and then now today

[15:29] and man he's just an angry judge no he's
[15:32] not judgment will be through me and
[15:36] you the Gentile AE will not be judged by
[15:40] Jesus Christ
[15:47] Alone the Bible said the books were open
[15:54] Thrones and the Saints would judge the
[15:57] Earth wow
[15:59] pretty wild but that's what he
[16:02] said he'll put a group of people as we
[16:04] were talking this morning he'll put a
[16:05] group of people on the Earth and the
[16:07] world the whole world will be judged by

[21:51] Jesus Christ but he's gone he's come
[21:54] back in Bride form he not in the Baptist
[21:59] denomination everybody understand me all
[22:00] right he could be in the people and work
[22:02] through the people but as far as that
[22:04] denomination he's not there he's in
[22:07] Bride form in the message of the hour
[22:09] all right now I didn't exclude people he
[22:12] did he said I hate that nickan Spirit
[22:15] now you say God hates yeah he does God
[22:18] has emotion hello that's where if we
[22:21] were made his enemies then we have that
[22:22] same emotion we just have a human side
[22:25] of it that we got to get rid of all that
[22:26] other stuff that's why this right here
[22:28] to be we get rid of our own self our own
[22:31] self
[22:32] stuff and then what be be what be
[22:36] diligent toward him and what he wants so
[22:39] Revelations 1:10 says I was in the
[22:41] spirit on the Lord's day I heard behind
[22:43] me a great voice of of trumpet saying I
[22:45] am Alpha and Omega the first and the
[22:48] last and what thou seest write in a book
[22:51] and send it into the seven churches
[22:52] which are in Asia Ephesus Smyrna now
[22:55] we'll get into this but you know these
[22:56] each one were cities right they were
[22:58] real cities were real people living in
[23:00] them but their character just I say
[23:03] happened to
[23:05] fit that age it didn't just happen to do
[23:08] that no they fit it perfectly God put
[23:11] them right where they needed to be so he
[23:12] could talk about them God put you right
[23:14] where you need to be today so he can
[23:15] talk about you all right and it's a
[23:17] smrna pergusa Sardis Philadelphia and Le
[23:21] DEA and I turned to see the voice that
[23:23] spake with me and being turned I saw
[23:25] seven golden candlesticks and in the
[23:27] midst of the seven candlesticks one like
[23:29] unto the son of man clothed with a
[23:32] garment down to the foot and G about the
[23:34] PS with a golden girdle his head and his
[23:37] hair were white as wool we're going to
[23:38] get into that in just a little bit as
[23:40] white as snow and his eyes were as flame
[23:42] of fire his feet like in Define brass as
[23:45] it burned in a furnace and his voice as
[23:48] the sound of many Waters he had in his
[23:50] right hand Seven Stars and out of his
[23:53] mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and
[23:55] his countenance was as the sun shineth
[23:58] in his strength you may be seated in the
[23:59] Lord as his Blessing to the reading of
[24:01] the
[24:01] word now that word mxed in my DST means
[24:06] among or from among are in the middle
[24:09] all right and not just in the middle as
[24:10] we saw this we'll see it here in just a
[24:12] minute he has outstretched hands and his
[24:14] hand stretches from alpha to Omega all
[24:17] right and everything in between he was
[24:19] but but what he's the reason he brings
[24:22] so much with Alpha which you know what
[24:24] Alpha and Omega is right that's uh Greek
[24:26] letters right Alpha and Omega Alpha's
[24:29] first EG you know you always say alpha
[24:31] male alpha wolf and Alpha that's why I
[24:33] go this first it's the most powerful
[24:36] then Omega over here which is the end of
[24:38] everything all right and he says I am
[24:40] Alpha and Omega he do omit that in
[24:42] between but he says whatever I got here
[24:44] this is the way I started my church it's
[24:47] going to be eroded down through the
[24:49] church ages but at the end I'm going I
[24:51] will restore sayith the Lord he's going
[24:54] to restore us back to the faith of the
[24:56] Fathers as brother R said the messenger
[24:58] of Malachi 4 to do two things one take
[25:00] us back to that but then tell us why
[25:03] right tell us how to get back to it and
[25:06] then how to take a body change all right
[25:09] cuz remember I don't know if you caught
[25:11] that this morning or not but you got
[25:13] seven virtues well they've got to go
[25:15] through one prism right which is number
[25:18] eight God's always Eternal he's always
[25:20] standing in a number as always seven and
[25:22] then you say well well there he is he's
[25:25] the
[25:26] prism
[25:28] we have to go through him he's the door
[25:32] all right everybody with me all right
[25:35] and there's the uh there's the picture
[25:37] that we were looking at he's standing in
[25:38] the midst with the eyes like flames of
[25:41] fire his his hair was like wool and
[25:43] we'll try to explain some of these and
[25:45] let brother random do it Seven Stars
[25:47] listen I really enjoy when he talk when
[25:50] he talks about all this when when you
[25:51] see John John's going to stand there and
[25:54] John's going to listen to what Jesus
[25:56] said now he saw Jesus in in in real life
[26:00] now he sees him
[26:01] glorified all right he's a young man but
[26:04] now he's got a girdle up here he's GED
[26:07] about the paps or across the shoulder
[26:09] with a golden girdle now he wasn't that
[26:11] way because remember I'll get to in just
[26:14] a minute you got to remember priest and
[26:18] Kings what did a priest do priest had to
[26:20] be dressed right priest had to
[26:22] administer what to the people or he had
[26:25] to go in the holy of holies and all that
[26:27] we we'll explain that in just a minute
[26:29] but he just saw Jesus as
[26:31] Jesus really didn't understand who he
[26:33] was until he came back on the day of
[26:35] Pentecost and went inside of John
[26:37] everybody with me all right so that's
[26:39] what he's seeing now a glorified Jesus
[26:43] but he is being shown right off the bat
[26:47] with a golden girdle up here
[26:52] feminis so bride form no other form but
[26:55] bride form all right everybody with with
[26:57] me but remember the son of man
[27:00] Revelation got lost in the church ages
[27:03] the son of man Revelation was that he
[27:06] was
[27:07] God you baptized in his name hell was
[27:11] not
[27:12] Eternal amen that got lost down through
[27:15] here so the Omega bride to bring Christ
[27:18] back
[27:20] here in its fullness of the godhead
[27:23] bodily to bring it back here it's got to
[27:25] go back to there to get that Revelation
[27:28] but then bring it back up here all right
[27:31] everybody with me that's where we're
[27:32] standing today with the full Revelation
[27:35] just like Paul Peter remember somebody
[27:38] told Brother Ram one time said oh
[27:40] brother R said what you
[27:41] have what you have we could write
[27:44] another
[27:45] book he said oh I sounded good he said
[27:49] but that'd be adding too so it's
[27:51] contained in those seven colors are
[27:54] those 66 books everything we need amen
[27:58] there's nothing new coming there's not a
[27:59] new Bible the only thing new is coming
[28:01] is your
[28:03] body that's what's coming but it's
[28:05] already written in the
[28:07] Bible and some people have already come
[28:09] to it Abraham got a new body but
[28:12] remember he
[28:14] died you
[28:16] won't he won't either that's why he says
[28:18] I'm the first and the last I I've got
[28:20] all the keys I um I'll read it this a
[28:23] little bit later in the chapter he says
[28:24] I've conquered death in hell I got the
[28:27] keys to the house I've done all this for
[28:29] you now go John write this to my people
[28:34] and give it out over the church ages and
[28:37] I'm going to form myself in a
[28:43] bride which is me and you and all the
[28:46] ones that down through the church ages
[28:47] all those too but remember they formed
[28:50] they formed a
[28:52] color of the rainbow the SE they formed
[28:55] a color but that color didn't bend
[28:57] toward a body down here that was being
[29:02] changed they're waiting on us to come to
[29:06] that place and to refract the light of
[29:10] then we got to go back to the son of man
[29:12] which is the white
[29:13] light right we go back to the white
[29:16] light bring the white light here and
[29:18] then everything is molded up in that
[29:20] white light which is the fullness of the
[29:24] godhead bodily in a bride not a eess a
[29:28] fullness cuz that's what's standing
[29:31] right here this is the fullness of the
[29:32] godhead bodily is standing before you in
[29:35] picture form but that's him and his
[29:37] characteristics and he's standing in the
[29:39] middle of the church or
[29:41] bride all right everybody with me okay
[29:44] flame of fire hair like wool he wasn't
[29:48] old sharp two-edged sword we'll get to
[29:51] those in just a few minutes all right
[29:53] and then feet like brass so just to
[29:56] recap this morning what does do a prism
[29:57] do as light passes through a prism it it
[30:01] is bent or
[30:03] refracted because listen we can't the
[30:06] first church age be it the first church
[30:08] age that it is it was close but it was
[30:11] not the fullness of the godhead bodily
[30:13] it was part of the
[30:15] light second age was what a color part
[30:19] of the
[30:21] light but that white light is the whole
[30:24] light I am the light of the world he
[30:27] said I I'm the one that come to light
[30:28] this world up but oh my that he caused
[30:32] he caused people to go into
[30:34] darkness he caused them to go into
[30:36] darkness cuz he was here it didn't he
[30:38] didn't make
[30:39] them but remember when you bring a
[30:42] messenger we read it this morning a
[30:43] messenger comes on Earth
[30:45] immediately there's a war immediately
[30:48] there's a separation listen when there's
[30:50] a war going on you got to choose a
[30:53] side you can't be neutral some people
[30:56] tried to be be neutral I believe it was
[30:58] maybe Missouri and Kentucky and
[31:00] different ones they want to stay neutral
[31:01] between the North and the South no you
[31:03] get drugg in one way or the other all
[31:07] right I don't want to stay
[31:11] neutral I want to be on the winning side
[31:15] and I don't want to be one of them fair
[31:16] weather fans that waits till this one
[31:17] looks like it's about ready to win then
[31:18] I jump
[31:19] in God May fool you you may jump in and
[31:23] your horse die you
[31:26] know so what does the prism do to light
[31:29] as light passes through the prism it's
[31:32] bent or refracted by the angles in plain
[31:35] faces of the prism and each wavelength
[31:37] look each wavelength of light light
[31:39] comes in a wave all right it's refracted
[31:42] by a slightly different amount ever so
[31:47] slightly that it one Blends into the
[31:48] other when you see a rainbow you see the
[31:50] color starting from violet or Indigo and
[31:53] it just Blends all the way through the
[31:55] other colors you don't see indigo then
[31:57] you see a gap and then you see yellow
[31:59] and then you see a gap and no they're
[32:01] all together but they run down and you
[32:04] can see them if you see a really pretty
[32:05] rainbow you can see all the pictures of
[32:07] it all the but they don't they're
[32:10] separate each age is separate but we
[32:13] have one
[32:16] light but the word let's just say it
[32:20] that way the word is refracted by a
[32:23] slightly different amount like I said
[32:25] before Luther's refraction of light or
[32:28] bending of light was the just shall live
[32:30] by faith right it was a color right it
[32:34] was in God's rainbow but now when Luther
[32:37] went to sleep and took the bride with
[32:39] him to sleep they went to sleep Wesley
[32:41] comes on the scene he bends it just a
[32:43] little bit more you can't just live by
[32:46] faith you can't go drink beer and and
[32:49] smoke a pipe in this
[32:53] age God said I'm a wink at that but I
[32:56] require our Holiness cuz I required it
[32:59] back in the first church
[33:00] age all right you understand where we're
[33:03] going then all right you got an age that
[33:06] age got sealed away baptism of the Holy
[33:08] Ghost Bride of Jesus Christ will judge
[33:11] their time
[33:14] period but now if you come to even come
[33:17] to our time Luther is not even going to
[33:20] get you in Brad
[33:22] form in our age why the light's being
[33:25] bent just a little bit more right
[33:27] where we can see another color of that
[33:31] white
[33:35] light that's why brother R said you know
[33:37] you red through Red's white he tells all
[33:40] these different colors we'll not get
[33:41] into that I don't want to I don't want
[33:43] to muddle the water up we can if we do
[33:45] it later on but not now but this is an
[33:47] example of it I didn't show you this
[33:48] morning when light passes from one
[33:51] substance to another it changes
[33:54] Direction now listen it doesn't do away
[33:57] with
[33:59] it you don't do away with God and you
[34:03] don't change him who changes we
[34:06] do we change to reflect his light which
[34:11] is bent in a little different
[34:14] way CU like I said but now see praise
[34:16] God if if Luther would have would sit
[34:20] here come here today come into this
[34:22] church not that I'm preaching any
[34:23] brother preaches brother Bob this this
[34:25] morning anybody and sit right there the
[34:28] Holy Ghost Inside of him would refract
[34:30] the light that he saw
[34:33] first he'd run it through his
[34:35] filter through his
[34:38] prism and say
[34:41] man I ain't never thought of
[34:43] that I got to change my thought process
[34:46] I can't go down and drink a beer in a
[34:48] pub and smoke a pipe he would believe
[34:52] this message of the hour because it's
[34:54] the same Holy
[34:55] Ghost but see God saw fit that Luther
[34:59] would make it in this age the man would
[35:01] fit the characteristics and that William
[35:02] Brandon would fit his right here how
[35:04] many people would you know that had that
[35:06] much power as you were watching or
[35:08] listening here where brother brandham
[35:10] had control of the whole
[35:11] building now some people that I
[35:15] know if you give them that much
[35:19] power they use it
[35:24] wrong maybe us included but brother
[35:27] brandham
[35:28] knew he was the most humble man he had
[35:32] the power he had the power to cast him
[35:34] two and make them to U the people that
[35:36] were having making love in the in the
[35:38] thing he said what Holy Spirit said you
[35:40] just say whatever it
[35:42] is he said oh I forgive
[35:46] them inside of us it'd be like they're
[35:48] interrupting the service they're doing
[35:50] this they're doing that I get rid of
[35:52] them Lord no he didn't get rid of me and
[35:55] you did he okay so when life passes from
[35:59] one substance to another it changes
[36:01] Direction This effect is familiar to all
[36:03] of us from observations in bathtubs and
[36:06] swimming pools and it's called
[36:08] refraction actually too and and if you
[36:11] look at it this
[36:12] way the refraction of a certain light
[36:15] now a certain light causes a
[36:19] mirage I didn't bring that but we were I
[36:22] was looking it up last night so what's a
[36:24] mirage it's fake
[36:28] but it's the bending of
[36:30] light you look out in the summertime you
[36:33] drive down the road and and if you ever
[36:35] if the light hits the the pavement just
[36:37] right what does it do it just
[36:39] glows right it don't even look like
[36:41] pavement don't look black it shines amen
[36:45] well that's what the refraction of that
[36:47] light is which Satan is also I didn't
[36:50] want to bring him in
[36:52] this he's a messenger of
[36:54] light hello and now what he said the
[36:58] Bible calls him that yeah so he's got
[37:00] his own refraction of light his own
[37:03] Mirage that he brought into the church
[37:05] age and defiled it made it lukewarm said
[37:09] oh that's beautiful looks like palm
[37:11] trees that father son Holy Ghost baptism
[37:13] man that's got to be it because Jesus
[37:15] said
[37:16] it right that's got to be right how many
[37:19] people told you that when you start
[37:20] talking to about water baptism they said
[37:22] well I'll tell you what Jesus said you
[37:25] tell you what Peter said
[37:27] I said well then the whole Bible's
[37:29] confusing them because he said something
[37:31] one here over here and in Peter he gave
[37:33] Peter the Keys of the Kingdom I said
[37:34] Jesus didn't even have the keys at the
[37:36] time Peter had the keys he unlocked the
[37:38] door and it was the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:39] all right everybody with me on
[37:42] that so this effect is familiar and it's
[37:45] also like I said before you put a straw
[37:47] in here and it looks like it's broke
[37:49] it's a refraction of light so Satan can
[37:52] be a messenger of light but it's his own
[37:55] light but it's so so close that we've
[37:57] got to see we got to see with eyes
[38:00] that's why the Bible tells us in our
[38:02] church age it's got to be the
[38:04] iav the Kung grease as brother Brandon
[38:07] was talking
[38:09] about that you put on the eyes and get
[38:11] the matter out of your eyes you know why
[38:13] cuz you don't
[38:14] matter somebody get that upon Passage
[38:18] through the prism the white light is
[38:21] separated into church
[38:24] ages remember
[38:27] even across the curtain of time brother
[38:29] brandom couldn't find Paul couldn't find
[38:31] arenius couldn't find Martin he found
[38:33] his own group of people cuz they
[38:36] reflected the light of that messenger
[38:38] for that
[38:40] day so that white light is separated
[38:43] into red orange yellow green blue indigo
[38:47] and
[38:48] violet and then you like we were talking
[38:50] about you put it through that prism but
[38:51] look what the prism is listen even a
[38:54] diamond or something flat will not
[38:56] refract light it has to be in an
[38:59] angle that's why we'll read a quote here
[39:01] in just a little while brother R talking
[39:02] about the future home he said that's why
[39:04] that that's why that mountain in that
[39:06] City had to be at an
[39:09] angle because the light refraction right
[39:13] we'll explain it in a minute then we
[39:15] talked about the allseeing a yall know
[39:17] about that so we'll get we'll just going
[39:19] through this each AG age had its message
[39:22] and its messenger all through time every
[39:23] age has packed his message with a
[39:25] messenger god and every dispensation has
[39:27] sent forth someone Anointed with the
[39:30] Holy Spirit to bring forth his message
[39:33] for that age every time God's Gift
[39:36] always find the places
[39:38] 1963 God gave his word so much here so
[39:41] much here so much here for each age then
[39:44] he sent a prophet down anointed to make
[39:46] that word come to pass and look it
[39:48] supports the other ones it didn't tear
[39:50] him
[39:52] down brother R didn't go across curtain
[39:54] time say now Paul preached something
[39:55] different than me bless God I'm Church
[39:57] AE messenger for number seven and he was
[39:58] number one he didn't know nothing now he
[40:00] said where's Paul he said he's in in
[40:04] other words he's another dimension he
[40:06] said well did I did did Paul preach and
[40:08] me preach the same thing he said well
[40:10] yeah he said well I made it then if Paul
[40:11] made it I made it right so he didn't
[40:13] tear each other down there the only
[40:15] thing you tear down is you false
[40:19] Doctrine true Doctrine can it's like
[40:21] brother Bob said you take a true
[40:23] Doctrine a true teacher a true uh
[40:24] whatever you want to call it if they
[40:26] confuse the people more when they walk
[40:28] out the door when they come in that's
[40:30] not a gift it might be a gift but it's
[40:32] from the wrong
[40:33] person this is supposed to simplify
[40:36] everything but listen let me add a a
[40:39] little caveat in there that brother Bob
[40:41] didn't if you ain't got something inside
[40:43] of you to receive it it will be
[40:45] confusing I don't care if you give them
[40:47] the
[40:48] ABCs you got to have the Holy Ghost
[40:51] inside of you to react to what's going
[40:53] to be said all right then then you open
[40:56] your heart up if you got the Holy Ghost
[40:58] it's not a problem to open your heart up
[41:00] cuz who's there God all right so then he
[41:04] sent a prophet down anointed to make
[41:06] that word come to pass now look anointed
[41:08] to make that word come to
[41:10] pass and it supports the other one that
[41:14] was coming see like the Messiah always
[41:16] supported every Prophet prophet in his
[41:19] own life his own being the word that was
[41:21] given for that day he come and fulfill
[41:23] that written word and foretold of what
[41:25] the other one was going to be in other
[41:27] words he's talking about the Old
[41:28] Testament now where Isaiah Ezekiel and
[41:30] all different ones they were supporting
[41:32] that there was a Christ coming there was
[41:34] an anointed one coming that Jesus was
[41:36] coming they didn't call him by name but
[41:37] they knew one was coming Moses said
[41:39] they'll raise up one like unto
[41:42] me
[41:44] okay and every one of them spoke of him
[41:47] talk about Christ cuz he was the
[41:48] fullness he was the head of the prophets
[41:51] he was the word of God he was the
[41:53] prophets amen there he is notice how
[41:55] wonderful what he was each one of those
[41:58] prophets Now The Seven Ages are set
[42:00] forth in Revelations chapter 2 like I
[42:02] said before chapter one is what we're
[42:04] going to deal with today it tells you
[42:06] who he is and where he's at right so
[42:10] establishes and then it goes right in it
[42:12] says to the messenger of the Church of
[42:14] Ephesus all the way to Revelation
[42:16] chapter 3 the very end where we're at
[42:19] and then Revelation chapter
[42:21] 4 you go up through the open door all
[42:24] right the bride does John typed the
[42:27] bride John was caught up in Revelations
[42:30] 4:1 right so that's us so The Seven Ages
[42:34] are set forth in Revelation Chapter 2
[42:35] and 3 takes in the whole span of the
[42:38] fullness of the Gentiles now see we're
[42:40] not talking about Jews we're not talking
[42:42] about anything else but bride what you
[42:45] got in your hand that that Candlestick
[42:47] that's got all those um circles in it if
[42:50] you don't know what well I didn't pull
[42:52] it up if you get your little thing out
[42:54] and you see the black part the black
[42:55] part is the blackness in the age the
[42:58] white part of that circle is the Bride
[43:02] of that age now remember in the last
[43:04] Church age when when brother randam drew
[43:07] the
[43:10] ages the angel that Drew them on the
[43:12] wall Drew him black in the seventh age
[43:15] no light at all he said I added a little
[43:18] light why because it's just a little
[43:20] light that's shining here and that's us
[43:23] but as I was saying before Oh I was
[43:25] telling we talk this morning downstairs
[43:28] this is the darkest age that ever
[43:30] was but it's got the most
[43:35] light Bible says if that light in you be
[43:38] Darkness how great is that
[43:42] Darkness that's why
[43:45] the United States of America's
[43:48] just great as we are we're going to fall
[43:51] at the feet of
[43:53] somebody because of the rejection of the
[43:55] message
[43:57] that came right at your
[44:00] doorstep in
[44:03] English all the technology all the
[44:06] electronics everything we have that the
[44:09] people over in other
[44:11] countries barely get a few books they
[44:14] get more now than they used to but 20
[44:16] years ago I mean if you couldn't find a
[44:17] paperback book you in trouble but now
[44:21] you can get them on you know little
[44:22] cassette form and have all the message
[44:24] on it praise God for that that you don't
[44:26] have to Lug a tape recorder back into
[44:27] the jungle and run off of
[44:30] batteries all right the whole time in
[44:32] which God is dealing with the Gentiles
[44:33] under salvation talks about that church
[44:35] age you're looking at it says the very
[44:36] same thing in opening and closing the
[44:38] message of each age unto the messenger
[44:40] of now remember the messenger gets it
[44:43] first but he that hath an ear let him
[44:45] hear not what Luther
[44:47] said
[44:49] us but what Luther said in his age his
[44:53] people then then Wesley I told somebody
[44:56] I told U Methodist the other day well I
[44:59] did yeah I told him I said look I said
[45:01] if if if what's going on in your church
[45:04] the United well it ain't United
[45:05] Methodist even unless you have gays and
[45:07] all that in it I said John Wesley didn't
[45:09] preach
[45:11] that John Wesley was a fire brand
[45:15] snatched out of the fire you know he was
[45:17] supposed to died he was in a second
[45:19] story bu house he was on the second
[45:21] floor that's why they call him his daddy
[45:23] called him that that he was a fire brand
[45:25] snatched out of the fire because
[45:27] somebody happened to look up and saw him
[45:30] against a window beating on the window
[45:32] and the house was completely
[45:34] consumed and he finally got something
[45:36] and hit the wall hit the you know the
[45:38] glass and jumped down in somebody's arms
[45:41] basically he was and then the thing
[45:43] collapsed course this is in 1800s they
[45:45] was wasn't the fire department there you
[45:48] know it was that Bucket Brigade a little
[45:50] bit of little bit of well he would have
[45:52] died and his daddy told him he said
[45:54] you're you're a fire brand snatched out
[45:55] of of the fire he was the last one of
[45:57] all the kids to get out they looked they
[46:00] found everybody else but him and they
[46:01] couldn't find him and he was upstairs
[46:02] somewhere but you you read the story I
[46:04] read the story about him here just a
[46:05] little bit
[46:06] ago but he was a fire brand though
[46:08] because then he took that fire and
[46:10] preached 14,000 sermons in his life he
[46:14] preached five sermons a
[46:16] day to five different groups of
[46:22] people I'll be 64 Friday I don't expect
[46:26] that to
[46:26] happen unless the Lord just really gives
[46:29] me a
[46:32] surge one a day two a
[46:35] day five a day could you imagine
[46:38] preaching five sermons a day they kicked
[46:40] him out of a place one time let let me
[46:42] tell you a little story about how the
[46:43] god gets the message out John John
[46:46] Wesley was preaching in a place and they
[46:49] kicked him out all right he couldn't
[46:52] find a place that they weren't kicking
[46:54] him out except on top of his daddy's
[46:58] grave it was a mum that come I mean not
[47:00] a mum like this but it came up in a slab
[47:03] like this they they buried him top on
[47:04] top of the ground so he goes to the
[47:06] cemetery jumps up on his daddy's grave
[47:09] he dares anybody to get on that with
[47:11] him cuz that's his daddy's and that's
[47:14] his property and he stood there and
[47:16] preached to you know several hundred
[47:17] people they couldn't kick him
[47:19] out you see how God gets his message he
[47:22] he just thought he said man my daddy's
[47:23] buried right out here cuz they they
[47:25] hated his daddy too if you'll remember
[47:27] that if you'll read about him they hated
[47:29] John Wesley's daddy kicked him out of
[47:32] every church that but he was preaching
[47:33] the word of God he was trying his best
[47:36] to do the best he could at the time but
[47:38] he was setting a stage for his
[47:40] son he he literally was setting a stage
[47:43] for his son do you get what I'm just
[47:46] saying by his death he set a stage for
[47:49] his son to stand on to preach Julie got
[47:52] it praise the Lord thank you
[47:54] sister
[47:56] but that's how the message got out he
[47:58] and he and he never stopped they kick
[48:00] him out of one place he'd go preach in
[48:02] another he' go find another place he
[48:03] could stand and then they run him out
[48:04] there and they go preach in another
[48:05] place where he can stand like Paul did
[48:07] the same thing they were going to kill
[48:10] Paul several times whipped him till
[48:12] almost he was dead did that stop him
[48:14] nope you're not going to stop the word
[48:15] of God it is absolutely going to get out
[48:18] whether we like it or not that's right
[48:20] notice here that Jesus by the spirit in
[48:22] every age addresses himself to only one
[48:25] person Rel Rel ative to the word for
[48:26] that age only one messenger for each age
[48:29] receives what the spirit has to say to
[48:31] that age and that one messenger is the
[48:33] messenger to the true church he speaks
[48:36] for God by Revelation to the churches
[48:40] both true and false the message is then
[48:43] broadcast to all but though it is
[48:45] broadcast for all who come within range
[48:47] of the message that message is received
[48:49] individually by only a certain
[48:53] qualified qualified group in a certain
[48:57] way each individual of that group is one
[48:59] who has the ability to hear what the
[49:02] spirit is saying by the way of the
[49:03] messenger the Two Sisters sat in church
[49:05] he said he called me a a vulture one
[49:07] said he called me an eagle same sermon
[49:09] all right those who hear are not getting
[49:12] their own private Revelation nor is a
[49:15] group getting their Collective
[49:16] Revelation as brother Rob was talking
[49:17] about you got to hear it from a
[49:19] five-fold Ministry and you got to go to
[49:20] church it's got to just I'm sorry that's
[49:22] the way God put it amen you can't get it
[49:24] at home by yourself yeah you can get
[49:26] Revelation but you're not going to get
[49:28] growth without doing what God
[49:31] Said sorry you just not we're we're not
[49:33] did you did you learn all your schooling
[49:35] and sitting at your house right that's
[49:38] what I
[49:39] thought those who here are not getting
[49:41] their own private Revelation nor is a
[49:43] group getting their Collective
[49:45] Revelation oh we've got this over here
[49:46] and y'all don't have it over but each
[49:49] person is hearing and receiving what the
[49:51] messenger has already received from God
[49:54] all right it takes a message first then
[49:57] delivers it to you and
[49:59] I we were talking about that this
[50:01] morning so here's the plan of it brother
[50:02] R tells us right here here's the plan of
[50:04] it in the first seal all right the first
[50:07] thing happens there's an announcement in
[50:09] heaven first what happened a seal is
[50:12] opened what is it a mystery is unfolded
[50:14] see and when a mystery unfolds then a
[50:16] trumpet sounds it declares a war or a
[50:20] plague Falls and a church age is open
[50:24] and we'll look at that chart we'll draw
[50:25] some few things on it maybe later
[50:27] on and see how they all blend together
[50:30] all right but they're separate but there
[50:32] is an overlap in between that that
[50:34] you'll
[50:34] see what is the war part the angel of
[50:37] the church catches the mystery of God
[50:39] not fully yet revealed but when he does
[50:41] he catches this mystery of God and then
[50:43] he goes forth to the
[50:45] people after the mystery has been given
[50:48] to him Goes Forth to the people what
[50:50] does he do out there he begins to
[50:52] Proclaim that message and what does it
[50:54] start starts a war a spiritual war we
[50:56] were talking about that this morning
[50:59] believe you me it's going to get
[51:01] worse believe you me it's going to get
[51:03] worse
[51:05] right you look now and see the people
[51:07] leaving the message families are
[51:09] dividing churches are closing their
[51:12] doors you can't even get in a tabernacle
[51:15] anymore can you brother Lis you can't
[51:17] get in a tabernacle it's locked they
[51:19] stay closed for renovation yeah okie
[51:21] dokie then you can take that two or
[51:22] three different ways and then God tell
[51:25] just
[51:26] saying I heard they were going to make a
[51:28] museum out of it boy brother Brandon
[51:30] would have enjoyed that and then God
[51:32] takes his messenger with the elect of
[51:34] that age and lays them away asleep then
[51:36] he drops a plague upon them who rejected
[51:39] it why they close it off and they
[51:42] rejected not you who was he talking he
[51:45] said not rejecting you they're rejecting
[51:47] me God said they rejecting me yeah
[51:50] they're not rejecting you they're
[51:51] rejecting me because I'm speaking
[51:52] through you and therefore they're
[51:54] rejecting me
[51:56] then as a temporary judgment and then
[51:58] after that is over then he goes on they
[52:01] denominate bring in denominations and
[52:03] start off of that man's work like of
[52:04] Wesley all the rest of you think about
[52:06] John Wesley how much he preached and all
[52:08] that effort he put into that
[52:11] church and see it now so fragmented
[52:14] allowing gays and women and all doing in
[52:16] the church to
[52:18] preach Right Wesley would have burnt
[52:21] well no he wouldn't have burned it
[52:22] physically but he would have burnt their
[52:24] hide yeah he preached
[52:29] Holiness but you but now wait a minute
[52:31] Wesley was a church age
[52:33] messenger he started a
[52:37] move of wesleyian or or the Wesley move
[52:41] right and it was ordained of God right
[52:44] what happened other men got involved in
[52:47] it and what eroded it or broke it down
[52:50] to where the original didn't listen this
[52:53] Methodist Church don't look like the
[52:54] original
[52:59] and listen the only thing it looks like
[53:01] the first church age is sitting here
[53:04] today you ought to be
[53:07] happy that God's give us that he's G us
[53:11] that ability we think oh great Paul
[53:13] great John great Peter
[53:16] great you're
[53:18] great you got the same God in you they
[53:21] did you got the same Alpha now is omega
[53:25] you got same thing they got plus a body
[53:30] change that's why the seals had to be
[53:32] open they weren't open in the first age
[53:34] second third fourth fifth sixth they
[53:35] open in the seventh age we'll get to
[53:37] that when we get to the seventh age and
[53:39] it look it gets all scrapple again and
[53:41] then another mystery comes forth what
[53:43] happens another messenger arrives on
[53:44] Earth for a church age then when he
[53:47] arrives the trumpet sounds he declares a
[53:49] war then what happens finally when he's
[53:52] caught away then when he's laid away a
[53:54] PL Falls destroys
[53:57] them spiritual death hits the church and
[54:00] that's exactly what's happened to the
[54:01] Wesley
[54:02] movement and that's exactly what's
[54:04] happened to
[54:06] the message
[54:10] movement spiritual death hit the church
[54:12] because they don't even go
[54:14] anymore and she's gone that group then
[54:16] he goes on to another
[54:19] one Revelations 1: 18 says I am Alpha
[54:22] and Omega the beginning and the ending
[54:23] sayith the Lord which is and which was
[54:26] and which is to come the Almighty I John
[54:30] who also am your brother and companion
[54:31] in Tribulation and in the kingdom of God
[54:34] and patience of Jesus Christ was on the
[54:37] island that is called patmas for the
[54:38] word of God and for the testimony of
[54:40] Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the
[54:42] Lord's day and heard behind me a great
[54:45] voice as a trumpet saying I am Alpha and
[54:47] Omega the first and the last now God's
[54:49] saying this so I feel safe saying
[54:53] exactly what Jesus said that's right
[54:55] right
[54:57] right have yall noticed when you look in
[54:59] your Bible you know in Matthew Martin
[55:00] Luke and John's read letter because
[55:01] that's what Jesus spoke right they
[55:03] consider that what he spoke go to your
[55:06] Bibles and look right now if you need to
[55:07] in Revelations verse chapter one it's in
[55:10] red letter this is not in red letter cuz
[55:12] I put it in red letters in red letter
[55:13] because it's in your Bible the even the
[55:15] scholars picked up that Jesus was
[55:17] speaking to
[55:19] John praise the Lord can't get it wrong
[55:23] when Jesus is speaking
[55:25] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[55:27] and the last what thou seest write in a
[55:29] book and send it into the seven churches
[55:31] which are in Asia then he pronounces
[55:33] them and I turned to see the voice that
[55:35] spake with me and being turned I saw
[55:37] seven golden candlesticks and in the
[55:39] midst of the seven candlesticks one lik
[55:41] un to the son of man clothed with a
[55:43] garment down to the foot and gir about
[55:45] the paps with a golden girdle here's two
[55:49] translations I
[55:50] was in daddy studying he's got a Bible
[55:53] he got 26 translations so I was reading
[55:54] it
[55:56] the emphatic diglot which is the
[55:57] original The Way It Was Written it's
[56:00] you're g at the breast all right which
[56:02] or about or at the breast or mfet says a
[56:05] belt of gold around his
[56:09] breast gold signifies what
[56:12] deity I've read y'all that quote time
[56:15] and time again when when you get the
[56:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost deity resides
[56:19] inside of
[56:20] you it proves it right here when John
[56:23] saw this Vision or whatever he was was
[56:25] looking at he saw Jesus Son of Man
[56:29] Standing with gold about his
[56:32] pths
[56:34] right seven Church
[56:36] ages this is in 1954 you know brother
[56:38] Brian preached him in 1954 but he
[56:40] preached him like all in one sermon but
[56:43] then he comes back and preaches them
[56:44] later on in the midst of the seven
[56:46] golden counil counter States like like
[56:47] unto the son of man what one like him
[56:51] who was this his
[56:53] bride one like him watch How It Was
[56:57] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[56:59] the Holiness of Jesus Christ covering
[57:01] her has washed us from our sins with his
[57:04] own blood all right he says G about the
[57:07] PS not a man a
[57:10] woman with a golden girdle the gospel
[57:13] that held the power and glory of God
[57:15] over the body of
[57:17] Christ 1954 the mark of the beast is we
[57:20] found the church standing there in its
[57:22] beauty Christ just molded into to it and
[57:25] the church had a white garment on and
[57:27] you notice it was a woman around the
[57:30] breast it had the Garment covering over
[57:32] her shame and was had a golden cord
[57:35] though pulled around so that it held
[57:37] around the breast white speaking of the
[57:40] righteousness of Christ and the golden
[57:42] cord represented the
[57:45] gospel all right the preaching of the
[57:48] Gospel brings the Holy Spirit over the
[57:52] church listen you're not corrected by a
[57:54] preach
[57:57] preacher you're corrected by the Holy
[58:00] Spirit through the word of God right the
[58:03] righteousness of Christ holds it there
[58:06] tied with a string the girdle
[58:09] string patas Vision 1960 now let's watch
[58:12] him just further as we take the rest of
[58:13] this verse and in the midst that's in
[58:15] the middle of the golden candlesticks
[58:17] one lik un to the son of man clothed
[58:18] with a garment down to the foot and GED
[58:20] about the PPS with a golden girdle now
[58:22] here's more proof of that this Doctrine
[58:25] is right about it being the Lord's day
[58:27] now he went back and we know this we
[58:29] don't have to go over it again it wasn't
[58:30] a 24-hour day John was there for two
[58:34] years the day of the Lord is the day
[58:36] you're in not a 24-hour
[58:39] day give us this day our daily bread is
[58:42] just say just give it one time don't
[58:43] give it anymore no that's the day of the
[58:46] Lord some of y'all eat too much bread
[58:48] between Services I told y all them carbs
[58:50] you get to
[58:52] you brother um brother kar's back there
[58:55] wide eyed and bushy tail cuz he didn't
[58:57] eat today it might be something let us
[59:00] have a fast between service no I tell
[59:04] you it is hard I mean you eat pasta or
[59:06] you eat some kind of rice or something
[59:07] and it does it it gets you
[59:10] pretty uh let's make a word car um
[59:16] carbonized by carbohydrates you get
[59:19] carbonized no it's you get sleepy but
[59:22] look watch this now this is where we L
[59:25] was talking about this is where he'd
[59:26] never seen this like this before and and
[59:28] and there's a lot of times we have
[59:29] pieces that we don't
[59:31] see preachers do that he was not a
[59:35] priest during this
[59:40] time he transferred that to me and
[59:44] you neither was he a king he was a
[59:50] judge because in righteousness the Bible
[59:52] said he will judge
[59:55] well
[59:56] now what is the glory of God it's the
[59:58] righteousness of his
[1:00:01] Saints it all connects back to me and
[1:00:03] you that's why brother brandom he
[1:00:05] everybody's like no this is the church
[1:00:07] everybody's part of the church we all
[1:00:08] look alike we all if y'all look a little
[1:00:10] different that's okay but brother R
[1:00:12] stood one day and said no this is the
[1:00:13] bride this is the way she acts amen this
[1:00:16] is the way the bride acts this is the
[1:00:17] way the church
[1:00:19] acts now a priest a high priest when he
[1:00:21] went into the sanctuary and went into to
[1:00:23] minister to service he tied himself
[1:00:25] around the waist all right everybody
[1:00:27] with me shake yourself just a little bit
[1:00:30] tying his girdle around the waist meant
[1:00:32] that he was
[1:00:34] serving right never tied it over his
[1:00:39] shoulder but here he comes out walking
[1:00:42] out with a girdle tied around the top
[1:00:44] with a sash over his shoulder gted about
[1:00:48] to pouch the breast with a golden girdle
[1:00:51] gted up high what is it an attorney
[1:00:55] a
[1:00:56] judge now hang with me for a minute he's
[1:00:59] still the Prince of Peace he's still the
[1:01:02] King of Kings he still all that right
[1:01:06] but when it comes to here when John
[1:01:07] turns and looks and sees that he is
[1:01:09] glorified so he's standing in the midst
[1:01:11] of the church and he's got his arms out
[1:01:14] and and basically what this whole part
[1:01:15] of me says is is these are my people and
[1:01:19] I'm going to judge the World by these
[1:01:20] people right here by the symbols I'm
[1:01:22] fixing to give to you and just now it's
[1:01:24] all about
[1:01:26] judgment cuz if you what remember if you
[1:01:29] turn down the messenger it's immediate
[1:01:33] judgment I'll read it to you in a minute
[1:01:35] he's an attorney a judge the judge with
[1:01:38] his sash over his shoulder gted up here
[1:01:41] not down as a priest see that shows he
[1:01:44] wasn't in his priesthood now John went
[1:01:47] all the way over into the Lord's day and
[1:01:49] saw him coming as a judge right all
[1:01:53] right everybody with me right here here
[1:01:55] 1963 we'll go back to what brother R
[1:01:58] says God takes his messenger with the
[1:02:00] elect of that age lays them away asleep
[1:02:04] don't let's don't Premed let's don't pre
[1:02:06] let's don't do it right now okay lays
[1:02:09] them away
[1:02:10] asleep and then he drops a plague upon
[1:02:13] them that rejects it a temporary
[1:02:15] judgment all right so now whoever
[1:02:18] rejected
[1:02:20] Paul listen whoever rejected Paul got a
[1:02:24] temper judgment well you know what that
[1:02:26] temporary judgment though is just
[1:02:27] temporary because it's a white Throne
[1:02:29] judgment that same judge is going to
[1:02:30] stand here but it ain't going to be
[1:02:34] Christ it's going to be Paul right it's
[1:02:37] going to be his
[1:02:39] people the Lord Jesus is going to stand
[1:02:41] there and said hey I judge you by them
[1:02:43] people right here did you turn Paul down
[1:02:45] were you one of those people that picked
[1:02:47] a rock up to Stone him well yeah I
[1:02:49] didn't like what he
[1:02:51] said well who judged him you were judged
[1:02:55] right
[1:02:57] there that's why the Bible tells us and
[1:02:59] I'll read it here in a few minutes when
[1:03:00] I get to
[1:03:01] it you're not even supposed to take a
[1:03:03] brother or a sister to court I mean a
[1:03:06] brother and sister somebody f with the
[1:03:07] Holy Ghost you do you problems
[1:03:11] inside now listen if you got if you're
[1:03:13] wronged out there and they're a bunch of
[1:03:15] Scoundrels if you sue them sue them take
[1:03:18] them to court whatever but not a brother
[1:03:19] and a brother or a sister and a sister
[1:03:20] the Bible's real plain about that and it
[1:03:23] says how can you judge here and you're
[1:03:26] going to stand and judge the world if
[1:03:28] you don't be able to judge here you're
[1:03:30] not going to be able to judge there then
[1:03:33] God takes his messenger with the elect
[1:03:35] of that age and lays them away asleep
[1:03:36] then he drops the plague upon them who
[1:03:38] rejected it a temporary judgment all
[1:03:41] right let's look at number
[1:03:43] one his head and his hair were white
[1:03:45] like wool as white as snow and the patus
[1:03:48] vision brother R says look John first
[1:03:50] notices and mentions the whiteness of
[1:03:52] his hair that's the first thing he
[1:03:53] mentions
[1:03:55] it was white and as bright as snow that
[1:03:57] was not because of his age oh no the
[1:03:59] brilliantly white hair does not signify
[1:04:02] age but look experience maturity and
[1:04:08] wisdom see
[1:04:11] that the Eternal one does not
[1:04:14] age what is time to God time means
[1:04:18] little to God but wisdom means much
[1:04:22] right right that's why we we been on the
[1:04:25] statute of perfect man you don't know
[1:04:27] how to judge unless you got something to
[1:04:29] judge
[1:04:30] by would you like to have an attorney
[1:04:33] that was been out that went to grammar
[1:04:34] school and decided to take your
[1:04:38] case that's what I
[1:04:41] thought Bob that look good wouldn't it I
[1:04:44] graduated 12 grade I I I can I can take
[1:04:46] this $25 billion contract yeah I think I
[1:04:49] can win it you get tore to Pieces is
[1:04:52] what you'll
[1:04:53] do
[1:04:54] but man that one with experience Hey
[1:04:56] listen lawyers are
[1:04:58] shrewd they know how to articulate they
[1:05:00] can take one word and change a whole
[1:05:03] change a whole courtroom setting one
[1:05:06] word an A or an and or a the or a but
[1:05:10] they can say oh
[1:05:13] well even the world understands this
[1:05:16] symb symbology for an ancient time the
[1:05:18] judge would appear in convene Court
[1:05:20] dressed in a white wig and a long robe
[1:05:22] that signified his complete author
[1:05:25] now look his complete Authority head to
[1:05:27] foot robe to meet out
[1:05:30] Justice right 1 Corinthians 6 verse1
[1:05:33] says dare any of you here having a
[1:05:35] matter against another go to law before
[1:05:37] the unjust and not before the Saints do
[1:05:40] you not know that the saint shall judge
[1:05:42] the world and if the world shall be
[1:05:44] judged by you are you unworthy to judge
[1:05:47] the smallest
[1:05:48] matter know ye not that we shall judge
[1:05:51] Angels how much more things pertain to
[1:05:54] this life all right so his hair is white
[1:05:58] as wool if you watch over in London they
[1:06:01] do that in England and when they have
[1:06:02] court doesn't matter what color the
[1:06:04] guy's hair is he puts on a white wig
[1:06:07] you've seen movies Netflix has got them
[1:06:09] all over the place ask Louise he'll tell
[1:06:13] you he's the only one that's got a
[1:06:15] Netflix account in this building right
[1:06:18] that's what I thought don't raise your
[1:06:20] hand but if you watch an old movie what
[1:06:23] that's a judge and he's the Supreme guy
[1:06:26] he walks in he sits down he's got the
[1:06:27] wig on it doesn't matter if he's 20
[1:06:29] years old or or you know 80 he's come to
[1:06:32] a place of authority so the bride has
[1:06:34] got to come to a place of authority so
[1:06:36] that she can present herself as a
[1:06:40] judge and that's powerful but see that's
[1:06:44] the first thing John
[1:06:46] saw he started at the head and headed
[1:06:49] down all right by look and his eyes were
[1:06:54] as a flame of
[1:06:55] fire brother R said those fiery flame
[1:06:58] eyes of the judge are even now recording
[1:07:00] the lives of All Flesh running to and
[1:07:03] fro throughout the Earth there is
[1:07:05] nothing he does not know he knows the
[1:07:07] desires of the heart and what each one
[1:07:10] intends to do there is nothing hidden
[1:07:13] that shall not be revealed for all
[1:07:14] things are naked before him with whom we
[1:07:17] have to do think of it he knows even
[1:07:20] now what you're
[1:07:22] thinking
[1:07:24] H some are not because you don't think
[1:07:27] when you sleep Zechariah
[1:07:30] 4:10 for who ha despised the day of
[1:07:33] small things for they shall rejoice and
[1:07:35] see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel
[1:07:37] remember what is zerubabel doing he's
[1:07:39] building this great Monument or this
[1:07:42] great statue stature with these seven
[1:07:46] they are the eyes of the Lord
[1:07:48] Seven running to and fro through the
[1:07:52] Earth what are the eyes the eyes are
[1:07:55] what they're the gateway to the
[1:07:58] soul there are some things I wish I'd
[1:08:01] never seen in my life cuz I can't get
[1:08:03] them out of my head well pray for
[1:08:07] me there's things I got stuck in this
[1:08:10] head that I wish I could turn that my
[1:08:12] eyeballs off but you can't but you can
[1:08:16] deal with it Lord gives you power over
[1:08:17] that okay but he look at John he he's
[1:08:20] got he sees wisdom he sees that that
[1:08:23] there's eyes not like eyes he's ever
[1:08:25] seen
[1:08:27] before and they're watching over the
[1:08:30] church ages all right in judgment but
[1:08:33] not to judge because
[1:08:35] remember that whole part of the son of
[1:08:38] man that's the bride form so the bride
[1:08:40] is standing there with all that on
[1:08:43] that's what you got to get the bride is
[1:08:45] standing there with all that the white
[1:08:48] robe I mean the white robe the wig the
[1:08:51] eyes that's
[1:08:52] you that's that's the characteristics of
[1:08:54] all Church ages put together God had
[1:08:57] eyes in every Church
[1:08:59] age God had wisdom in every Church
[1:09:03] age and he'll judge with that wisdom out
[1:09:07] of every Church age right and his feet
[1:09:10] was liking toine brass as if they burned
[1:09:12] in a
[1:09:13] furnace now look brass is noted for its
[1:09:15] remarkable hardness now we know brass
[1:09:17] means judgment anyway all
[1:09:19] right there is nothing that is known
[1:09:22] that you can put with it to temperate
[1:09:24] but this brass that describes his feet
[1:09:26] is more remarkable yet and that it has
[1:09:29] stood the test of the fiery furnace he's
[1:09:33] not talking about Jesus at the moment
[1:09:35] he's talking about your trials and your
[1:09:38] tribulations things you overcome
[1:09:40] remember we're going to get into the
[1:09:41] church ages he that
[1:09:44] overcometh what what do you overcome
[1:09:46] with those feet of
[1:09:49] brass a test that no other one has gone
[1:09:53] through
[1:09:54] amen and that is exactly right for brass
[1:09:57] signifies Divine judgment a judgment
[1:10:01] that God decreed and brought to
[1:10:05] pass the serpent on the pole is the top
[1:10:07] of what Jesus coming to the Earth to
[1:10:11] accomplish now how does God heal how did
[1:10:13] he heal down through the seven Church
[1:10:15] ages did he just walk did he just come

[1:11:17] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[1:11:19] world judgment had already passed upon
[1:11:22] him when as yet there were no Sinners

[1:16:56] the first thing is a trumpet or a voice
[1:16:58] a shout then a voice then a trumpet a
[1:17:00] shout is a messenger getting the people
[1:17:04] ready the second is a voice of the
[1:17:07] Resurrection the same voice a loud voice
[1:17:09] in St John 11:38 that called Lazarus
[1:17:12] from the grave I look getting the bride
[1:17:17] together through the
[1:17:19] voice the two-edged sword and then the
[1:17:22] resur rection of the Dead see to be
[1:17:25] caught up with it now watch and he had
[1:17:27] in his hand right hand Seven Stars this
[1:17:30] is what got me the other day I was
[1:17:31] thinking Lord you know we you've got all
[1:17:34] these things set up but you put them
[1:17:36] people in your
[1:17:38] hand you didn't you didn't let an angel
[1:17:41] do
[1:17:43] it you did it
[1:17:45] yourself you have them in your hand and
[1:17:49] if you got them in your hand there's no
[1:17:51] way you can make a mistake right amen he
[1:17:54] picked those Church age Messengers by
[1:17:55] the characteristics of the age and the
[1:17:57] person that fit
[1:18:00] it in his right hand were Seven Stars he
[1:18:02] had his right hand Seven Stars now of
[1:18:04] course we already know from verse 20
[1:18:06] that who the seven stars seven stars are
[1:18:09] the mystery of the Seven Stars are the
[1:18:10] Angels or messengers of the seven
[1:18:12] churches now we can't make couldn't make
[1:18:14] a mistake here on any account as he
[1:18:16] interprets it for us like I said before
[1:18:19] God Jesus is standing there his hand is
[1:18:22] out stretch Seven stars are in his
[1:18:25] hand they're
[1:18:27] connected can't make a mistake when
[1:18:29] God's got you in his hand these Seven
[1:18:32] Stars Are The Messengers to the seven
[1:18:33] successive Church ages they are not
[1:18:36] called by name they are just set forth
[1:18:38] as seven one to each age from the
[1:18:40] Ephesian age on down to this lean age
[1:18:42] each messenger brought the message of
[1:18:44] Truth to the people never failing to
[1:18:48] keep it the word of God to that
[1:18:51] particular Church age
[1:18:53] each one held
[1:18:55] it they were steadfast in their loyalty
[1:18:58] to the original light the white light
[1:19:01] through the
[1:19:02] prism they were steadfast in their own
[1:19:05] loyalty to the original light as each
[1:19:07] age pulled away from God though his
[1:19:09] faithful Messengers turned that age back
[1:19:11] to the
[1:19:12] word their strength was from the Lord or
[1:19:15] they never should have stem could have
[1:19:17] stemmed the tide they were safe in his
[1:19:20] care for nothing could pluck them out of
[1:19:21] his hands in other words he had a
[1:19:23] messenger sitting here named Paul he had
[1:19:26] a guy waiting in the wings called
[1:19:28] irenius another one Martin colum but he
[1:19:31] had them waiting and ready to go in his
[1:19:35] mind then when they got the Holy Ghost
[1:19:37] he just give them what they
[1:19:40] needed nothing could pluck them out of
[1:19:42] his
[1:19:43] hand PMA vision and this Comfort is not
[1:19:46] for the seven Church age Messengers only
[1:19:49] oh I forgot to tell y'all y'all are
[1:19:50] included in this
[1:19:53] and this Comfort is not for the seven
[1:19:55] Church age Messengers only every True
[1:19:58] Believer is in the hand of God and can
[1:20:01] draw from his love and power and receive
[1:20:03] the full benefit of all that God is to
[1:20:05] the
[1:20:05] believer what God gives the messenger
[1:20:08] and How He blesses and uses a messenger
[1:20:10] is an example to all believers of his
[1:20:13] goodness and care to
[1:20:15] all members of his body
[1:20:19] amen uh that includes
[1:20:21] you Isaiah 49:16 says behold I have
[1:20:24] Graven thee upon the
[1:20:27] palms of my
[1:20:30] hand thy walls are
[1:20:32] continually before me so we see the
[1:20:35] Seven Stars but you're included in
[1:20:37] that that's why it's important to have a
[1:20:40] messenger to each age because that
[1:20:41] connects us to that star everybody with
[1:20:43] me that star is the
[1:20:45] connection follow the
[1:20:49] star you ought to write a song about
[1:20:51] that out of his mouth went a sharp
[1:20:54] two-edged sword Hebrews 4:12 for the
[1:20:56] word of God is quick and powerful and
[1:20:58] sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:21:00] piercing even to dividing a sunnd of
[1:21:02] Soul and Spirit and of the joints and
[1:21:04] Marrow and discerner of the thoughts and
[1:21:06] intents of the heart now we saw that
[1:21:08] more in this age than every other age
[1:21:10] ever saw that was recorded right
[1:21:14] Revelations 19:11 says and I saw heaven
[1:21:16] open and behold a White Horse He that
[1:21:19] sat upon him was called faithful and
[1:21:20] true and in righteousness he do judge
[1:21:23] and make war his eyes were as flame of
[1:21:25] fire that's kind of familiar same guy
[1:21:28] and his head was many on his head were
[1:21:30] many crowns what
[1:21:32] you
[1:21:34] you and he had a name written that no
[1:21:37] man knew but he
[1:21:38] himself and he was clothed with a
[1:21:40] vesture dipped in Blood and his name is
[1:21:42] called the word of God and the armies
[1:21:45] which were in heaven followed him who is
[1:21:47] that us upon white horses clothed in
[1:21:50] fine linen white and clean and out of
[1:21:52] his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with
[1:21:55] it he should Smite the Nations or judge
[1:21:59] the Nations cuz he will rule them with a
[1:22:01] rod of
[1:22:02] iron in the Millennium we know one thing
[1:22:06] for sure that's the son of David he'll
[1:22:08] Ru Rule and Reign Over The 12 Tribes of
[1:22:10] Israel where's the
[1:22:12] queen where's the queen sitting right
[1:22:15] there beside
[1:22:20] him and he treaded The Wine Press of the
[1:22:23] wide press of the fierceness and Wrath
[1:22:24] of almighty God and he hath on his
[1:22:27] vesture in his thigh a name written king
[1:22:28] of kings and Lord of lords we know
[1:22:31] that's all capital letters but do you
[1:22:33] know that he is revealing the heart
[1:22:35] secrets of men and women in this age in
[1:22:37] which we are
[1:22:38] living do you know that I'm asking you
[1:22:42] that do you know that he's revealing
[1:22:44] like I said before whatever you got
[1:22:45] inside of you folks it's going to come
[1:22:49] out hide it as long as you want to it
[1:22:52] will show now in the end time it has to
[1:22:56] cuz it's fullness you can't hide from it
[1:22:59] there's not a dark space over here there
[1:23:01] a question mark no it's all been full
[1:23:04] right so you're going to have to let out
[1:23:06] what you got inside of you you may be
[1:23:07] like a pressure cooker have to let it
[1:23:09] off all at one
[1:23:11] time good or
[1:23:14] bad who else could reveal the secrets of
[1:23:17] the heart but the word
[1:23:20] himself not a person person the word
[1:23:22] does it the word right now today you you
[1:23:26] you we're thinking of Judge every time a
[1:23:28] sermon
[1:23:30] comes are you ready you're
[1:23:35] judged you either come in Better or
[1:23:38] Worse go out worse why because you've
[1:23:41] judged what you've not maybe so much
[1:23:43] what you've done the week before cuz
[1:23:45] we've all done stuff but in the heart
[1:23:49] the secrets of the heart the inside of
[1:23:51] you I I well I'm living it but but I I
[1:23:54] mean I'm I'm showing it outside but I
[1:23:56] just really don't know about you know
[1:23:58] this long hair thing I think I'll just
[1:24:00] trim it this way a little bit or I think
[1:24:02] I'll well what what what hurts just a
[1:24:05] little bit of of pain on the old barn um
[1:24:08] or whatever daddy used to say but it's
[1:24:10] same still the same old barn but you
[1:24:13] know no you're dabbling around with the
[1:24:17] Devil the devil not God the devil amen
[1:24:22] right right and remember if you don't
[1:24:25] know it the devil owns the fence you're
[1:24:28] sitting
[1:24:29] on that's right but who else could
[1:24:32] reveal the secrets of the heart but the
[1:24:34] word himself Hebrews 4 and12 and he
[1:24:36] reads the same thing I did it is the
[1:24:39] word it is performing where look unto it
[1:24:42] was
[1:24:45] sent listen this message was sure it was
[1:24:49] broadcast over the world but it wasn't
[1:24:50] sent to the world that's right right it
[1:24:53] was sent to me and you it was sent to
[1:24:55] his bride that would
[1:24:57] hear it was sent for it the word is full
[1:25:00] of power it is the same spirit that was
[1:25:03] in Jesus the word that is present again
[1:25:05] in the church in this last age as a last
[1:25:09] sign trying to head the people off from
[1:25:15] judgment for they that reject him the
[1:25:20] word are now already coming to
[1:25:23] judgment so that's why you got the judge
[1:25:25] standing there in the seven Church ages
[1:25:28] right crucifying him
[1:25:31] aresh number seven that will be done
[1:25:34] right here his countenance was as the
[1:25:36] sun shineth in his strength all right
[1:25:41] Matthew 17 verse1 says after six days
[1:25:43] Jesus taketh Peter James and John his
[1:25:45] brother and bringeth them up into a high
[1:25:47] mountain and was transfigured before
[1:25:48] them and his face did shine as the sun
[1:25:52] we see his characteristics on Earth his
[1:25:55] face did shine as the sun and his
[1:25:56] reignment was white as the light Exodus
[1:26:00] 34:35 and the children of Israel saw the
[1:26:02] face of Moses that the skin of Moses's
[1:26:05] face Shone wow and he wasn't even born
[1:26:10] again he wasn't a church age messenger
[1:26:12] either he was a prophet oh no doubt he
[1:26:15] wrote as Paul as Paul wrote most of the
[1:26:17] old New Testament he wrote most of the
[1:26:19] new I mean the old but the skin of Moses
[1:26:23] face Shone and Moses put the veil upon
[1:26:25] his face again until he went in to speak
[1:26:27] with God in other words the people
[1:26:29] couldn't even look at Moses's
[1:26:31] face right now let's take that times
[1:26:33] 10,000 time 10,000 with the fire of God
[1:26:36] inside of
[1:26:38] us the
[1:26:40] bride for behold the day cometh that
[1:26:43] shall burn as an oven Malachi four we're
[1:26:45] heading toward five and all the proud ye
[1:26:47] all that do wickedly shall be stubble
[1:26:49] and the day that cometh shall burn them
[1:26:51] up say the Lord of hosts that it shall
[1:26:54] lead them neither root nor Branch but
[1:26:56] unto you that fear my
[1:26:59] name the sun's not going to bother
[1:27:03] you
[1:27:04] right the fiery wrath of God will not
[1:27:07] bother you because if you'll realize
[1:27:10] what I'm telling you today you are the
[1:27:12] fire of
[1:27:13] God you are the eyes of God you are the
[1:27:16] two-edged sword you are all these
[1:27:19] characteristics that John
[1:27:21] saw
[1:27:23] the son of man standing in the midst of
[1:27:24] the church ages and he giv seven things
[1:27:27] that he saw and seven I don't where they
[1:27:29] get that word from that letter from but
[1:27:31] to you that fear my name shall the son
[1:27:34] of righteousness arise with healing in
[1:27:36] his wings and you shall go forth and
[1:27:38] grow up grow up as calves of the stall
[1:27:42] everybody starts as a
[1:27:44] calf right now listen to
[1:27:47] this prove my point then we'll close
[1:27:50] musicians get ready to come
[1:27:52] Revelations 21 getting toward the end of
[1:27:54] the Bible here and there came unto me
[1:27:56] one of the Seven Angels which had the
[1:27:58] seven vows full of the seven last
[1:28:00] plagues and T with me saying come hither
[1:28:02] now watch come hither I will show Thee

[1:28:17] wife H and he carried me away in the
[1:28:20] spirit to a great and high mountain and
[1:28:22] showed me that great City the holy
[1:28:24] Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from
[1:28:27] God who is that the bride having the
[1:28:32] glory of God in her

[1:28:48] Crystal reflecting the light revelation
[1:28:52] 21:21 and the 12 gates were 12 pearls
[1:28:55] every several gate was of one Pearl and
[1:28:57] the street of the city was pure gold as
[1:29:00] it were transparent glass now remember
[1:29:04] this city what kind of shape is this
[1:29:06] city
[1:29:11] in a
[1:29:13] prism a pyramid so that it can reflect
[1:29:16] the light cuz watch there's not even
[1:29:20] going to be a sun in the city
[1:29:22] if there is a sun it's going to be
[1:29:24] outside and we brighter than
[1:29:27] it cuz watch and I saw no Temple therein
[1:29:31] for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb

[1:42:52] brother Ram said he said a sister
[1:42:54] praying for a
[1:42:55] sister would be better in other words
[1:42:58] than a brother praying for a sister CU
[1:43:00] we can't enter into what they're going
[1:43:01] through we can't enter into that but
[1:43:04] they
[1:43:06] can cuz you know what I'm sorry but
[1:43:08] they're wired a little different than we
[1:43:10] are emotion and things like that it it
[1:43:14] it it it clouds our sometimes our
[1:43:16] judgment it clouds us up a little bit
[1:43:18] but but deny that
[1:43:21] if it's bad pray for it's good if it's
[1:43:23] bad Praise Him for us
[1:43:25] good so let's bow our heads and pray and

[1:44:30] in the body of Christ that we have to go

[1:44:35] just anoint these sisters Lord anoint
[1:44:38] the brothers Lord to pray the prayer of
[1:44:40] faith and it's the right word to be said

[1:46:14] blood that atonement Lord and we we're
[1:46:17] doing that now as the Bride of Jesus
[1:46:19] Christ cuz you told us a prophet that we
[1:46:21] are the blood by the spirit of God so
[1:46:23] Lord there had to be someone lay a hand
[1:46:26] on or or something like that that's okay
[1:46:29] but father we need to believe as
[1:46:31] Gentiles and not even have our hands
[1:46:32] laid on each other but father as a
[1:46:35] connection Lord we we pray that you'd
