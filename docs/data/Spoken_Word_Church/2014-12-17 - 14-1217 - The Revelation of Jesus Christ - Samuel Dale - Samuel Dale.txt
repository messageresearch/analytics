the thoughts and everything gifts that you gave and we certainly do appreciate all of the food it was really wonderful I mean we had food on top of food and and was on top of food so it was good and I still say we've got the best cooks in the world and I don't we may not I believe it kind of like Josh was when he's going to school their football team wasn't too good you know they got beat just about every game and but he was in the band but they had a faithful saying they said our band to beat your band any day you know cuz that's all they could brag about well you can't brag much about the preach in here so we just brag about the food that we get and we really appreciate everything and all the Lord bless you for that uh is that all the announcements I guess I covered everything uh if you'd like to turn in your scriptures we want to read from Revelations 1 1 through three and this tonight will just be kind of a a background part because I want to get this out of the way I really want to get on over into uh more my point but I want to get this out of the way to kind of lay a foundation and then we will be speaking about we're getting on over about verse 12 13 14 through 18 and all on the glory of his person you know that's what we'll be taken but tonight we're just going to talk about the revelation of Jesus Christ okay father we thank you for your grace and your love unto us we thank you for the day and the time and we pray that you'd gu each one of us this night in your your way and your doings and bring to us your thoughts because that's what we need more than anything be with the sick ones Lord touch each one our Lord and be with Brother Gary and just reach down and touch him and just deliver him from this father because we believe you he believes you he confesses his healing we confess his healing and we just depend upon you to make it manifest and Lord thank you for being with Rick there and taking care of him in the wreck and all and just bless each and every one the sick among us Lord be with each one brother nle to just reach down and touch him and have your way Lord forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness that we may walk in your love in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 and we'll read about 1 through3 it says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it that's now and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing I've preached on this many times before but I just want to get kind of a little thought into her mind and it will help us to understand later you know how that I've tried to bring it there to me where it says and the time is at hand I believe this is the time right right cuz when else would it be you know uh if we believe we're the end time people if we believe this is the end of the world has come upon us then the time is at hand the time to what the time to understand right right the time for it to be made reveal remember in the adoption over re over in Romans 8 it's a time to wit the Redemption of our body the time to understand the Redemption of our body all right so I believe this is the time to understand you know the revelation of Jesus Christ now brother brandom says it like this I didn't give these to the brothers to do up but on the patmas vision he's reading the scripture of the Alpha and Omega the coming down and we'll read in just a minute and he says before I show you anything I want you to I want to let you know who I am that's what he's saying to the church other words before we cons cons anything before we go on any further the main thing is what to know who I am him he says the greatest of all the revelations is the deity the Supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ you can't get to first base until you believe that all right now that should be what you know our thoughts then he goes on you know later in the message and he says all right the first of all Revelation is the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ you must know who he is when you hear the voice amen now we'll get to that on later in further into the message see if you don't know who he is how would you know the voice you remember there's many voices there's many things you know that goes in a lot of ways I was sitting back there a while ago and and uh enjoyed sister Peggy singing but when they got to going into the next song we had two people playing I was going to say this cuz if anybody on the internet you know caught it there was two people playing and I put my hearing aid in today and thought I'd start using it I thought I'm getting rid of this sucker cuz I'm getting to to two thing and it was a little mess up that didn't get turned correctly but I would I thought I throwing this thing away just bringing in two things I'm getting what used to be but now listen what is the greatest of all Revelations the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ all right now the prophet says Christ mystery of God revealed I said we've been through this many times he says that is the Revelation that would reveal all things when he would come back to the church Age series with it is what the revelation of Jesus Christ now you can't go anywhere he said you you can't get to first base you know if you don't start out with the right Revelation well now where would a uh trinitarian come up with it see how can they comprehend because you can't get down to where he says I'm the alpha and the Omega well you know a trinity would be glad to say oh yeah he's the alpha and God's the Omega and the Holy Ghost is all in between I guess and we can you know we can juggle it around but we know that won't work all right but the revelation of his Supreme deity now I will say this to emphasize because I've always tried to do that I don't believe you can understand who you are until you first know who he is all right now so then that would be the foundation is to know who he is then we can talk about who we are because there's no bride there's no uh sunship there's none of those things without the first being of him all right now but then he turns around all right and he in the Book of Revelations never reveals himself apart from his people that's what he does because see he knows that we you know cannot comprehend uh an eternal God so he does everything he can to try to bring us to a position to where that we can get a little idea and I say that truthfully cuz I've you know how I've taught you that here you know that I've taught you I believe what we get here whatever amount we get here is just a little bitty background that when we get over there you know it'll be just enough to get us started and really just enough to get us there and I wouldn't mind saying it all just barely enough to get us there I don't mind saying it that way if you'll understand what I mean I mean that he's going to reveal what we have need of to get us there all right but if he doesn't reveal that how are we going to get there well what does it matter my brother used to say what does it matter about all this you know as long as we get that there well that's a good point you know that's all right but I I'd like to know where there is and I kind of like to know how we got there you know I don't like to go anywhere that I don't know where I'm going you know I remember one time I was going down the highway it used to bother me to ride New Roads you know doesn't matter how much you talk about well this road but it always bothered me to go a new route now if you ever take me one time 90% of the time I'll take you back there because you know I won't remember the roads but I can take you there all right but I was thinking you know why should I be concerned about this there's a highway in front of me somebody is made the highway and the signs along the road says you know Gainesville Georgia so that's the place I'm going so why should I be concerned about it and then it struck me you remember the children of Israel when they were coming out of Egypt it said Moses told the people says tell them to pull up together in other words get them in close just paraphrasing it he says because they haven't been this way before well then I realized that I had not been up and down that Highway because if I had I would have known where it was going and whatever it would be and uh but then it I realized that hey somebody has somebody's been there so I just get on the highways now and I just trust to signs and the things you know because somebody has been there well you know we don't have to worry about it somebody has been there and seen this John went to patmas saw these things come back and you know give them unto us put them in a book for us made it to a place that you and I would have an opportunity and that's why it says there and I love that where one day I was listening and where it says blessed is he that readeth and they that hear and I was listening to a t r around and said look there said it's a blessing just to be be able to read and I thought thank you Lord huh but you see I wasn't thinking like and it is it's a blessing because there's a lot of places in the world they can't read the Bible they don't have it it's not there and all but I what I was thinking I thought well a lot of people can hear it a lot of people can read and they get a blessing you know I'm not throwing off on any churches or anything they get a blessing from that but what about you and I that have the opportunity to hear the word without it being like it used to be to us you remember that you remember when you used to read maybe you read the book of Revelations you know maybe you read chapter one and you know the Revelation that God give to Jesus to give to John well look at there's got to be three of them right and see we we were so massivly confused until we knew nothing about it other than words of a page and that was a blessing i to read it but what about being able to read it with understanding of what the very author is trying to say you know that ought to make us rejoice you know greatly to know that we have been chosen to receive these things it is not a secret mystery that you and I are the only ones that understand the mystery we're this that or the other no it's available for everybody right but now everybody's not going to receive it amen because they can't right and the reason they can't is the way they chose it they chose it to be that way so it's the problem is our choosing well see we should say well I choose to read you know I've chosen the message so my point shouldn't be to try to read the message that you and I have received from the prophet of God and to try to figure it out any more than to try to figure out the Bible itself you know now to study it ponder over it pray about it search it out yes sir re I believe in that but then my final point is to come back to one thing if I can't find an answer why you look anywhere else right right if you can't find an answer why look anything else well then just stop shut up sit down listen and somewh the prophet said it like this one day he said God will put some somebody on the platform all right it may be a Baptist preacher it may be a Methodist preacher it may be a woman preacher but she can be used of God to speak to you amen right so we thank God for that but then how much more do we thank him for having a five-fold ministry right that we'll study out the message to find the answer in the message not to find it in G's Aline and everywhere else but to search out the message see we we're blessed to have the ability to think these things out and not look at it and think of a trinity and look at it and think of this and think of that and try to ponder this and try to wonder what this is and you know yourself that the first three verses there to most people the only thing they get out of it is an argumentative form over whether brother brandham come to John on patmas or not because it was Revelation that God gave to Jesus to give to John and he sent and signified by his Angel well I believe every been that I believe brother brandham come to bring the message to you and I but I don't believe he come to write the Bible John was the one chosen to write right so he didn't come to write it well see the other side of it is that people says well he come to bring it to John because he was a prophet I would walk very softly there because you're treading on dangerous territory and in doing it the best thing to do is to say well why what would it do us any good that's what I want to I told one brother one day I said what would it do you any good if you knew brother brandom came to John on platas would that make you in the Rapture would that save you but see it's tantalizing things and points I believe what the prophet said but believe it this way cuz one time he'll say it was a prophet that came to John all right well we can run with that but what he what about when he says it was not a prophet that came to John that God came himself what about what brother Brandon says that the The Book of Revelations his revelation of Jesus Christ given to John for Christians of all ages it's the only book in the entire Bible that is written by Jesus himself through personally appearing to a scribe brother Brandon says it like this he said the Book of Revelation is the only book that Jesus put his own hand of writing you know his ping his doing well see we try to figure out these things well what good would it do to figure it out and get it figured out is it going to save you that's right instead of looking at the revelation of Jesus Christ you realize what you're looking at is a revelation of William Brandon you're not looking at the revelation of Jesus Christ you're not depending upon God you're depending upon a prophet and thank God God sent us a prophet and I believe it I do I believe you and I would have never understood the Book of Revelations without God sending us the prophet that he promised in Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 Amen brother random because he come to bring that but he's not my God right the prophet of this day the brother brand said is the Holy Ghost well no no Holy Ghost is a spirit that's all you have to know about it you just studied all you've done and that's all you know your Prophet is one that said it was the Holy Spirit brother random wasn't the prophet he was a prophet now that's where he says it the prophet is the Lord Jesus Christ all right I simply asked one brother a question it meant a lot to me maybe it doesn't to you I said there's a lot of prophets in the bible and I said uh why would you want to pick one certain one you know well because it's you know it's our day it's our time it's our I said but why don't you say say that that was the prophet that come to John right now when you say it was the prophet cuz if you say brother brownon was the prophet you're making him Jesus Christ so now you're deity and don't even realize it all right but you see I know that by stating things I get into trouble I was thinking the other day and I was telling Brother Gary about it we got a little life and uh you know if I preach against people having a beard mustache you know some people here this ding some would go away thinking you don't like beard I preach against you know women and clothes and hir well he's just picking on those I preach on serpent seed here he knows I told him I didn't exactly agree with him on that so he's up there picking on me well when this is all over and said I was laughing because I would like for you to write me something I could preach that didn't get on to somebody all right so I just do the best I can do do and you're going to have to put up with that or find you another Pastor in which way you like it I just go on just be myself and don't come to me and say was you talking about me I'm going to say yes that's the best way to answer it is it cuz you got it all figured out that that's who I'm talking about well just say yes that's what I said leave that like it is don't say nothing about beards and he don't like them I preached one day an hour and a half on manifested sons of God you know went outside and this certain brother he come up some of you laughing because you probably stand out there when he did and he come up he said you don't believe in manifested sons of God do you I said I just preached an hour and a half to show what brother randam said about them and proving they were here you know but it don't make no difference so I just preach and forget it you know we do the best we can but see my point is not whether that was brother random that come to John on Patman what good would it be if we figured it out right there's no salvation in figuring out the letter of the word right the Salvation is the god of the word being delivered to you and I amen and we'll get down to it later on in a message or two later I know there's three times in the Book of Revelations that that it speaks of that John speaks that he fell down on his knees and talking to that Prophet but if I you it's in I'll give it to if you li it's in Revelations 1 U 17 all right it's Revelations 19 and 10 and it's in Revelations 22 1 through 10 or 12 or whatever down through there all right but if I was you I would go read because the one in 117 plainly tells you who he is that come to John and patas he says I'm the alpha and the Omega then that would make R random deity see people don't realize they what they're doing and run in Revelations 22 it flops from one side to deity because of your red letter Edition showing you who is speaking right is that the purpose of the red letter Edition well I don't believe the red letter Edition well that's all right but that's a purpose what it's in there for it simply means that God himself is speaking all right but you see we take that and without even trying to listen to the revelation of Jesus Christ cuz I believe that you're saved by revelation of Jesus Christ I believe you're healed by revelation of Jesus Christ I believe we'll be delivered out of this world in a Rapture One Day by the revelation of Jesus Christ I'm not looking for all of these things that everybody else is trying to find new names and all kind of things something to try to get us out of here when we wire out or get through using the name of Jesus and he wants to be something else let him be what he wants to be but until that time we must remain with what we've got and even after we leave out of here I thought it would be Jesus Christ that would go to the Jews I thought it would be Jesus Christ it would be sitting on the white throne you see but yet we're trying to find something come on I'm just as human as you are I told you about it first time I went to Jeffersonville we looked up her and over the the cross it said I in R well I was a dummy I didn't know what that meant sorry so I thought I found something I found me something I'm going to ask for the M this quick as I can and I went out to her and I didn't tell him what I was thinking I just told him I said hey what does that mean up there over the cross i n r he said it means Jesus Christ King of the Jews I I didn't never tell him what I was thinking so it's not wrong to search it's wrong to let your searches run into the you into the ground right to where you can't come up with an understanding see it's the revelation of Jesus Christ given to John right see it was given God gave Jesus the revelation of his own self because remember the story we can prove it show what the prophet he said there he was when Jesus was on Earth he said he at that time didn't understand what all of these things was going to be but said when he come to patmas did he knew you know when he come to patmas you know what he had done he had went from where he said I come from God and I go back to God right he had went back to the Supreme deity that's not three God gods or whatever that's more one God than anything in the world excuse me I love to holler but it runs that old throat out that's all right we just cough drop it and keep going all right well the main thing I want you to get tonight is not an argument over brother random if you if you want to believe he come to John on P that's your business I just don't believe it I believe it was the Lord Jesus Christ who came to John O patmas to bring him the Revelation that God had give him of himself right what says and it says and he delivered it or give it to his servants he sure did he had to give it to John right right come on John himself was a prophet he had to give him that to write it who wrote the Book of Revelations Jesus personally appearing to a scribe but the scribes want it wrote it down amen but you say well you're doing away with brother Brown was part on thank God because I said it while ago if it hadn't been for him you and I wouldn't know what the Book of Revelation was talking about on anything we give the honor to the honor he is the one that God chose to speak to us what is in the book and to bring that unto you and I about Jesus Christ as I said he said before I show you anything I want you to know who I am and look what he goes right straight through and I want you to I want you to think with me cuz I want them to pull up Revelations 1:4 and I want you to think about this and if I miss the number of the ANS you forgive me but I emphasize the word an can be changed to even right even and an is an interchangeable word where it says the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ God and Father sounds like two people don't but why don't you read it God even father you don't have to do that in every case because in every case it doesn't translate as an and you know but I want you to listen to my point when we finish because he says I want you to know who I am before we go any further all right who is he who is this one and how you could spend I did before you know months on talking about the Revelation that God give to Jesus to give to John see if it wasn't true one true and living God where would we be and if it didn't if God did not descend down back there you know to be the Loos the speech the the Son of God the one to bring the word where would we be be right right right but look what he says here cuz now he didn't know his brother brandham said it he didn't know his part in the Kingdom that's a direct quote you desired be glad to get it for you but he said at this time when he came here he had went back to where he came from and there he stood now remember this one that's being described is just not the body of Jesus all right it's just not the Son of God it's just not the holy spirit it's not just the father that's being described it is all of that amen right father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ it's all of that described in one form to show you who it is and remember this is the person the person of Jesus Christ which is the person of almighty God Amen right no father son Holy Ghost no trinitarianism no thoughts no Oneness idea because you do have all of these manifestations of father son Holy Ghost to make the one true and living God Amen all right and see then coming down to it look what he says John to the seven Church Ages which are in Asia Grace be unto you even peace from him which is even which was even which is to come even from the seven spirits which are before his throne not having to change something to make it fit you'll get to point in a minute even from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness even the first begotten of the Dead even the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us even washed us from our sins in his own blood even hath made us Kings and Priests unto God even his father to him be glory and Dominion forever even ever listening to a tape the other day where brother R was talking about said he made us Kings and Priests he said see there he didn't make him Kings and Priests he already was the king he already was the prince he made us what He Is Right Glory behold he cometh with clouds even every I shall see him even they which also P which pierced him even all kindreds of the Earth shall whail because of him even so amen I am Alpha even Omega the beginning even the ending sayth the Lord which is even which was even which is to come the almighty not to just make a a point of even and an the point is each one of those is the same person now you got the point you got the point now every one of them evens is going to bring you right into to describe something down here to show you I am Alpha even I'm the Omega I'm the all of it the beginning even the ending when he uses that word even or and he's going to give you a description of his personality that's why when we get over into the next message we'll be talking about for a while the Sevenfold Glory of his person all right but you get what I mean everything in there that's described is speaking of the same one true and living God Amen all of those ands ands ands and what did the prophet say when it comes to like and or this you know and two or something and he says there's something going to be two things connected that's paraphrasing the quote but it's close enough two things are going to be connected we see my point is you pull any of them hands out and you don't have a complete picture now let me illustrate that what if you took out the you got the descriptive form of him are you following me a person one person all right now what if you left the sixth verse out what if you took that out you would not have a complete picture even though you would have say and I'm just using that as an illustration see all the other end even translating you know would relate directly to his person but when you get to verse six look what it says and hath made us even priest unto God and to his father to him be glory and Dominion forever even ever you see now he's putting it in the perspective that he wants it because he's going to bring the church into view all right I didn't write the book I I'll bring this out more Sunday but you know that what is it Christ Myster of God revealed where brother brandom says the bride is part of the mystery and must be revealed that's right well now what if you reveal him and don't reveal her you got a problem but at the same time if you just run to her and make her the great things without it being what he made her look what you've done see him without us is one way of looking at it he could do something with it but us without him cannot be nothing done with it there's no hopes without him being first so the first thing he tells John look John before I talk to you you're here I'm going to send this to the churches I'm going to tell what it is and I'm going to show my my place and purpose in my person and where I'm going to be but John I first want you to know who I am I first want you to realize who I am and I want you to realize that me without you I can get along without you right he created us that's right he brought us into being but to display his attributes to do this that the other no he couldn't do it but still in the beginning he could have done without us right but said you can't do without me there's no way that you and I could be anything without him right see then that's what I see the people of the message doing even the ones that seem to try and I use that word maybe lightly but not throwing off on nobody at all but just saying it that you don't hear people preaching about Jesus Christ no more it's some kind of a seed or an attribute or this or that or the other well I didn't know there was any attribute whatsoever outside of Jesus Christ I mean that's the way I've always understood it to be because I thought all the attributes of God was displayed in Jesus Christ I mean you know but you know and you will if you'll think just a little bit and admit it to you that have have heard the things of the people of the message it preached there's always some kind of something pointing to them and their little group or doctrine or thought it's like I was trying my best to bring out Sunday a point on like the the grace of marriage and divorce and a lot of people believe if you wouldn't sitting there that day that there's no Grace for you you had to be sitting there that day some drop it down as long as you sitting there now you know but you just think people wouldn't believe that but they do I don't believe it's for everybody in the world no way I've made myself Plain on that don't go out there and try to explain marriage and divorce to a new convert you're messing it up you're killing the people well they need to know you didn't learn it that way but you see that's where it goes and then I start screaming and hollering why because that gets down within me to realize and think what the poor people of this message had had packed down their throats and yet you ask him no I don't believe that well no my pastor he doesn't believe that I said here here's the quotes that he put out well he was just saying what brother brandham said but listen Jer do you understand my point John don't you worry about nothing you just sat down under a shade tree and maybe he gets you a pencil and paper you know whatever he had something you write on and you write down what I tell you and said then you send it to the seven Church ages but I want you to know who I am John so what does he start off with pull back up forward and let's look down at it again with a thought then in mind of what we're looking at pull up Revelation 1:4 and let's start again to the church ages Grace Grace be unto you in peace from him which is which was and which is to come that's Hebrews 138 right he which was Grace be peace he which was which is which was is to come that's right Hebrews 13:8 that's that he's the same yesterday today and forever and from the seven spirits all right see you say well no there's not no see argue over seven spirits where there seven no they might be six there might be five I don't know didn't argue argue argue there's not seven spirits it's the seven manifestations of the spirit of God in each age right that's right the same spirit of God amen not changing in the agees God never changed man changed and look and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness then you get over to Revelation 3:14 you know and he's the the witness you know right the beginning of the creation of God that's right look and the first begotten of the Dead now we know for sure who that is and the prince of the kings of the earth we know who that is unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood amen now he inserts right in the middle of all of the showing the person and he shows you where that person is going to be right verse six is not a descriptive form of that this a descriptive form of where he's going to be and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever then it jumps right back to him behold he cometh with clouds and never eyes shall see and they which pierced him all the kingdom then he says I am the Alpha and Omega I'm the beginning and the ending I'm the all and all and I want you to know that then you'll know John what to send to patmas you'll know what to say because you won't be trying to figure out anything you'll be writing down what I say right now it's always been amazing to me U I've never been around Pentecostal people that much but you know we listen to a lot of tapes and and we'll hear a lot of tongues and interpretation you know that's on the tapes and uh you know Peggy was asking me one day because see one person spoke the other person interpreted well the other second person just kept on going but see brother brand said it's got to be F phrases and everything the same and just keeps on going she said well well that person kept on going was that correct I said yeah because that brother brandham said they will enter into a prophecy and continue bringing their message but what I my point is this now um brother Lise all right now brother Luise can come up here all right come on we'll get him involved he likes to do that don't he okay come on all right and he can interpret into Spanish what I say all right now that's really good okay you get over here where they can hear you on the microphone I want you to tell them that I'm talking this I w't I am talking about the revelation of Jesus Christ and he said every word I said but would you mind saying every word I said for the past hour I don't understand that but he simply means that he can't do it whatever he said revelation of Jesus Christ right okay thank you my point right my point how can somebody speak in tongue and give 30 words just a short 30 words and yet somebody in a few minutes will stand up and interpret that right now it's word for word how can you remember that The Interpreter brother brandom says hears in his own language right what the other person has spoken in their language but still how can you remember it you never thought like that how can that person remember for five minutes and come back and say the same thing that this other person said over here now brother Louise what he can handle the revelation of Jesus Christ but he can't tell you what I said 10 minutes ago why he's interpreting word for word right but what about the great Pro the great things that God can do when I hear a tongue and interpretation I listen come on I listen brother Rand sometimes he'll say say see there they Vindicated exactly what was going on or something like that but I sat there in amazement to realize that God could put that person's words from Spanish into English or whatever French into English and then I could tell you exactly what he said in in French and I could remember every word right you tell me that ain't God you do you get what I mean amen God can do wondrous things so he could tell John what to write all right and John maybe would get it in a Flash remember he's a prophet he goes and sits down as I said under a tree that's just an illustration and he starts to write and he writes what God told him the day before right you understand me amen you understand me Le of God write sit down and it'll be word for word what God had told him two days or three days before these ministers can illustrate it maybe better than I can but it it's different being a teacher than it is a and I don't mean difference in God now or anything but a teacher operates a little different than a say a uh an evangelist style or a or a pastor style or an apostle you know Prophet whatever there's there's different Ministries and uh see all I've got to do is get a thought brother Woodby used to tear him up we'd assign him a topic in the old ministers meeting days and and he go HeyWire he said don't do that I said just give me a topic I'll take it up next time we have a service he said but I'm not made at way I've got to get an unction right to go with it well see that's his ministry I'm not against that I'm trying to explain it John is sitting on patmas he's a prophet right cuz that's what brother Brown called him he's the prophetic one out of the four Matthew Mark Luke and John and John being there like he is God speaks to him and he just sits down and he starts write it I don't mean it to be exalted or be anything in the world you name a topic you name a topic for me to speak on and you give me a scripture or tell me to let it fall open and I can preach on that topic because that's the ministry that's there an evangelist he can't do that he has to have something to related and stirring up and and going so God chose John to be there to where he could tell him and tell him what to write but what about the great Apostle Paul in the apostleship in the uh height or whatever you want to call it or whatever office or what you're doing Paul was way above because I looking the quote yesterday or day before there where brother random was talking about said Paul had a greater revelation and all the others but yet Paul wasn't chose to explain the revelation of Jesus Christ on the aisle of patas right right he wasn't even chosen to write about you know this out of the other but John wasn't chosen to write about the communion where Paul could write about the communion it's all in the ministry wise of God the seven spirits of God down Through the Ages leading Mankind in what to do but my point is this brother Brown said we must get into the spirit of the author amen he said there's where trouble's at we don't get in the spirit of the author now watch what I'm saying he didn't say we don't get in the spirit of The Interpreter we don't get in the spirit of the person speaking he says we don't get in the spirit of the author lot of difference in all the others in the author when I get it like that from him I don't care who's against me i' invite the world it's out there now invited to come and show me where I'm wrong why because I'm not afraid of it amen cuz you see I know that he'll take care of it that's right see he chose the right one to go to patmas right the one man that would have the ministry that he could follow him and that he wouldn't get this and run off on it and get that and run off on it and grab something else and just run with it he knew he could tell him and he would write it and it would ever beit come out to be perfect then Paul could not be different than John right Peter wasn't different than John in Doctrine come on his behavior not Doctrine yet Peter said Paul says things hard to be understood that some wrestle to their own destruction you know he said at least I've learned not to wrestle with it that'd be the best way of interpreting what he saiding he learned to just wait but why can't the people wait on God to reveal it I believe there's a Bible talks about it called it a time to all things it doesn't say there's a time for all things it says there's a time to all things right well this is the time to understand what the prophet has brought unto us amen we don't have to go to patmas I remember years ago people would say have you been on the backside of desert said if you ain't been in quote brother R said no man has a right to be in a pull pit unless you been on the back side of the desert well okay we desert you know I mean where we going well then we'll do like the man up and turn Tennessee did that time he got him a bunch together and he got him some things and and I ain't talking about them guys that from off I'm talking about some people this messy and he had all this and boy they loaded up these guns and they got these hor of course he had the White Horse that was the thing nobody couldn't have a white horse but him and he boy he rode out there and he found these great Revelations but the same man looked at me one day and he said this is what he said he said you got it by Nature he said ' I went to school to learn what I got he said I'll swap with you any time said no way cuz see he thought the dick remember that when the guy had him to stand up and read and he to sat down nothing to do he punched me and he said he's been trained you see he thought I'd been trained then when I started speaking about the word that was with talking about then the ministry lined up with that and begin to you know you see it doesn't matter how much John went to patmas is my point there's got to be somebody to believe it like what do you mean we've had it for we've had it for 2,000 years now John wrote it amen but God wants somebody to believe it that's right and you know what he wants us to believe because how many times have I preached this to you that Jesus has never shown as I was saying a while ago anywhere in the Book of Revelations by himself that's right he's always shown with or in his people most of the time in his people so is this the revelation of Jesus Christ or Jesus the one Oneness form that you would bring that it would only reveal Jesus Christ then your Oneness if this message only reveals Jesus Christ your Oneness but if the bride is part of the mystery then there's not a Oneness end to it right that's right it's a true revelation of where he is and what he's doing it's the right understanding is seeing that the Book of Revelations is our book the book they told us to stay away from the one they told us we couldn't understand well you know what they was right right we couldn't understand it but God come down and brought a prophet yes sir Amen to bring us to Revelation not of himself that's an automatic process for it to be involved it's someone is trying to describe God to you you ought to have enough sense if he's describing it correctly listen if somebody's describing God to you and he's doing it correctly you ought to know how you ought to have enough sense to know who's talking right you order to be able to believe that as an interpreter can interpret and a guy can you know speak and another interpret 30 minutes later and give you the same wording that God can lead somebody did he can take a fivefold Ministry and take this message and carry it on if not what do we need them for right but you ever noticed that people that don't believe in the five4 ministry they never stopped being Pastor you ever seen one yet it did I want his name I'll call him and apologize I want his name name if he says it ain't no five full ministry so we don't take no tithe no more and I'm not the pastor I want his name because it ain't TI he's wanting it he gets the tith he's the one's doing all of it he don't believe in a four-fold Ministry why don't he say that he believes in himself but remember watch this the next message we get into or the one after when we get into that voice and a prophet would say that voice and the person is the same now what if that voice chooses to use uh when are you sisters to speak from no no there ain't no woman we're not talking about woman the pullit cuz you know how I preach it and how I believe it you're not going in because that your husband is going you're not going in because your wife is going you're going to go because you're an individual in the Body of Christ right depending on someone else yes that's wonderful but when that someone else comes between you and God you mind if I quote or the prophet would tell the sisters that you don't have to be in subjection to him if he's wrong to you you don't have to obey him when he's doing something wrong to you well okay all right that's okay with me but I'm to the point of one thing you talk to me about Jesus Christ and I don't know whether you're telling the truth or not and you bring that Christ right down into form and I'll shout with you but if you run Jesus out the door and you got the only the bride left I'm going to leave you and there won't be no shouting there'll be some hollering and screaming because that's where I stand if he's the author and finisher of our Salvation if he's the Alpha and the Omega if he's the beginning and the ending if he's Hebrews 13:8 then why don't we depend upon him why don't we depend upon him and just say okay now Lord You've revealed yourself to us now you're trying in this last days to reveal where you're at you're no longer here in fleshly form as the body of Christ you know the poor mortal body Etc but you're here in The Bride of Jesus Christ and now you're revealing yourself where you're at what a rejoicing time it should be to comprehend that almighty God is trying to join himself so close to a human being until even David in the spirit would sing and say they pierce my hands and my feet right the same thing The Man Without two 3,000 years later hung on a tree he was in the first person brother Brandon makes a statement he said David spoke in the first person well you know what you do when you speak in the first person they ain't no second person right if it is you'd be speaking in the second person right they ain't no second person it's the same person speaking but the surprise is where he's from right and with brother dick favorite Paul on the road to Damascus smitten and down he understood the light he knew there was something Supernatural and he understood theight and and I'm quoting brother around he recognized that as the Old Testament and said he would not have called it anything else he said because he knew who that was but the surprise was when that voice spoke and it was really a surprise when he said I'm Jesus and Paul says oh Lord something's happening now help me Lord CU I didn't believe in you you know and you're saying that's who you are you're saying the one that was on the tree they was crucified he almighty God and I'm very find it because I realized who's speaking come on get the message of what brother Bram said he said Paul would not have called that Lord had he not known that that was the Jehovah of the Old Testament and that was a surprise when he said Jesus that was a surprise well Paul could say okay I'm doing pretty good cuz see I I never did you know I never did persecute Jesus yeah as a matter of fact so me and uh me and Kus and what was her name Nicodemus and gamea said me and Nicodemus and kameha said we talked a little bit about him and said I I I didn't get mad but he said said Paul you don't understand I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest thank you Jesus Paul Rod over there and his blinded eyes couldn't see but his eyes in his heart begin to open he knew he was on the way to kill those Christians that's right he then realized who they had been killing they had been killing Jesus that's right the same person just in a different form do we believe it that way do we treat one another as Jesus Christ on do we take the thing brother Brandon would say to us what about one like this he said what if God let that person say something to you to find out what you do we don't want to quote that and do we that's uh we we don't we we want to leave that and you know that was before the seals broke you know what I mean that's where the people of the message do things but what about it do you see what I'm trying to get at in the Book of Revelations that he's never revealed nowhere there by himself he's always revealed in somebody or with somebody you know and it's very rare that it's the with part most of the time it's the end part brother brand says chapter 1 through three we'll pick these back up he said that is the church he said chapter 4 through 19 is Israel he says in chapter 19 through 22 he said it's both of them together but yes we got it all how can it be Hey Brother D how can that be because Revelations 10:7 I've had them throw at me that's until you get sick at your stomach to give people what brother brandham said one day he explained it and he said talking about you know Revelations 1 TR there and he he explains it and he says that's thus sayith the Lord and yet people are just but look at look at Revelation 10:7 I said look at it right right it's got to be to us it's got to be to Israel now what's your problem yeah but what about 184 where it says come out of her my people I said what about it Israel comes out of her it's a compound meaning but you see people don't want somebody that will stay with the scripture even to just quote them they want their ideas about what it says something they can live with come on Brothers but you see it's a revelation of Jesus Christ but the Book of Revelations is showing where Jesus Christ is at Matthew Mark Luke and John is a revelation of Jesus Christ Genesis through Revelation is the revelation of Jesus Christ Paul is explaining the great mystery and even spraining explaining the bride and that's where the Prophet comes up with it and said the bride is part of the mystery and must be revealed but none of them brought it like it was given to John on patas and all we want to do is our argue about who was behind the tree and what I mean by that is one simple Point who done this and who done that well if we find out who done this and who done that where will it help who but we find out what it was saying and then let God reveal that amen then we can rejoice in these other things things will be made known when we need them I can go with you on the new name that's fine but I can go with you where the Prophet said what he said it'll be made known maybe when we get there so now you just start to give the two quotes yeah but this got to be a certain way it's got to be brother rand's mouth was formed a certain way to speak that word I didn't I'm just plain if that's true we need to get some good pictures of him and go have some operations right I mean is that aggravating is that me being hateful to say if he's it's got to be over like this then we everyone need to walk around and I'm not joking either I'm trying to say it like it is if that's all it is get an operation no that man's heart was what was made right where he could speak amen that soul of that man that could live so close to God until he could get an audience with God sure it would have been an amazing thing to walk with a man that could tell you how many fish he going to catch before you caught them how many deer you going to kill where they was at and whatever he told Brother John Martin one day brother John got sick and they was hunting he told Brother John he said if he didn't tell him where to go he said John and that's what John told me now he said brother Brown said now John you not feeling too good said if I was you I'd go right down here to this little creek or something you know went down there today he killed the biggest deer of the whole crowd I believe that I believe it happened but I believe he preached the revelation of Jesus Christ in its Purity to you and I there's my part that I enjoy let's stand 369 red book 369 in the red book anybody have a need the Mighty God is Jesus the prince of peace is he the Everlasting father the king ET I believe same yesterday I believe in praying for the sick don't I believe he's the Healer I believe he's the Savior but it's just like I told Brother Gary it may sound like doubt but it's plain common sense I said Brother Gary we're talking today I said we can't make God do what we want him to do host the but I said we can say what he's already done the high priest the lamb for siners slain the Au Redemption no glory we can say by shs I'm Healed he can bring it on to S we can say we sa we can bring it on but you can't make him work all and who would want to do that wouldn't that be back there in the book of Acts where the man said give me power that I may be able to give to whoever I desire the holy ghost that sound like a good point they thought he thought they could just give anybody and perfection our right and power sound like a good Jesus it's like I told the Church of Christ man one day and I wasn't laughing making fun of him I said if all you got to do is be baptized first off you're wrong you baptized father son Holy
