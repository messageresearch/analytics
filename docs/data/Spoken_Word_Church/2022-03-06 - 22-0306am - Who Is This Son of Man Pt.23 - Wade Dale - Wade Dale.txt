========================================

love surrounds me like a seed i'll praise the name of jesus lift up the name of jesus for the name of jesus lifted me let's stand hallelujah amen praise the lord ready to give a rightful answer for what all men asked of you i i thought part of the scripture i'm reading this morning i was in the barber shop the other day when i walked in they were discussing should we go to church or just gather wherever we wanted to and he said well i don't i don't i don't have an answer to out the bible but anyway i said well there's the answer in the bible for what you were asking exactly but he wanted that was all he wanted to hear what he had spoken and people asked you a question with the answer already in that question but if you know what jesus christ won't you answer the way he tell you too we're going to read this morning from hebrews the 10th chapter verses 19 through 31. amen let us pray heavenly father we ever grateful and thankful love for your presence being with us love for god and lead us in the truth and understanding of your word father let us hold fast to that which you have given out to us regardless of what other men may say lord your holy spirit will lead us and we thank you for it wherever we are whether we're in sickness in health in pain or feeling well lord let us hold fast unto you but we love you and we thank you god guide us in this hour in jesus name we pray amen we're going to read from you hebrew the 10th chapter beginning with verse 19 through 31. heaven therefore brothering bones to and into the holiness of the blood of jesus and having in high priest over the house of god let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised [Music] forsaking dissemina not forsaking the assembly of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the day approaching but a certain and fearful looking for the judgment of the fire in the nation which shall devour the adversaries how much of how much sober punishment i suppose ye shall he be through worthy who has tried under the foot of the son of god and has counted the blood of covenant wherewith he was sacrificed an unholy thing and has done despite the spirit of grace it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god amen god bless you maybe praise the lord praise the lord jesus amen said fail not to assume yourself together especially as we see these days in this time in my my mind no hiding place but accepting jesus christ hallelujah i was speaking with a friend of mine from from ukraine yesterday and um he was just telling me you know how you know they grew up with russians all around them i mean it was just normal and um you know what he's saying putin is saying is he's trying to take it back 300 years ago you know to how things were at certain times and they've really seen him as like he's lost his mind like he's out of his mind and um i said you know in my mind just talking to him i'm like we know it's just spirits it's it's spirits but god is having his purpose brought forth you know and of course they don't know how this thing is going to stop or will it stop be but you know they're saying he's going to go you know once you get ukraine he's going to keep going and he said it's he said it didn't just start now he's been doing this he's been preparing this you know the different countries over there georgia and belarus all those areas he said he's been going in and taking over these places it's just now it's more visible you know he's been on this this mission you know to to reclaim what ussr all these countries that that split off and nato has taken these countries has been taking these countries over you know for some years now and that's kind of what he's opposed so he's trying to bring the ussr back together and my you know he's telling me the missiles that the u.s got i guess we got some submarine over there got like 20 atomic bombs aimed at 20 cities in russia so putin knows if he does anything and they got their weapons as we know from our prophets so it's like any any day anytime you know so we just got to hide in jesus christ he's that strong tower amen we don't even have to fear because we know that god has us in his hands amen let's sing blessed is the name of the lord as we get ready for the word name of the lord is a strong tower we can run in it and be saved amen praise the lord jesus blessed is the name of the lord blessed is the name of the lord a blessed is the name of the lord most high blessed is the name of

come up here and then after second service so let's i believe that's everything that we got we we appreciate like i said the technicians doing they're doing the outstanding job back there in the back it's taking more to taking more to run but they've got more to give so and we have another visitor well she's been here before but she's now revealed she was hidden she was hidden in she was hidden inside anna but we have a new baby cambrie with us today so i can't even remember her middle name cambrie dale isn't good enough for me right now but good to have her with us they're back there in the back so um like i said she's been here before but she's in a different form that sounds familiar now she's being revealed amen and just pray for them let's go to john 1 verse 1 and let's pray before we get started dear lord we thank you for this day we thank you for the people that have come here lord to worship you in spirit and truth now i pray lord that you take over this service that you be the active participant lord you be the one that does the speaking and the hearing lord and reveal to us lord what we need for this end time father we pray that you'll be with the ones that are sick be with the ones lord overseas and ukraine and all the different believers around the world lord has just become a just become a everyday thing lord for something to come up and there be a sickness or a death or or something going on but lord you said when we hear wars and rumors of wars to look up because our redemption draws nigh thank you god that you sent us a prophet to tell us these things so we we don't worry so much that we know that not one atomic bomb is going to hit this earth until the bride's out of here so we pray lord that you would just take the fear away from the people let us focus on you because we've got to finish this journey lord this journey has got to be completed and we which are alive and remain shall be waiting lord for the resurrection and that's what we're heading to now lord we pray that you sanctify us lord for this journey in jesus name we pray amen all right this is who is the son of man who is this son of man part 23 so a little slow but we're all southerners and that's okay but i've been enjoying it i saw some things yesterday that i had not seen before and i'll share them with you this afternoon in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god all right let's go to verse 14. and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as if the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated in the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now remember as we've been talking on this series that that we know that pertains to jesus christ we know that god promised us a redeemer and that redeemer had to be a kinsman he couldn't be melchizedek even though melchizedek was god because he was not our brother this man that's going to take away the sin of the world is going to have to be a man a flesh man that's going to come into this earth be born like me and you except without sex but born like me and you amen and that's going to be the savior of the world and that is what the scripture calls the son of man because that is a man a god man in human flesh well now what we've been talking about though is is why why just say that about jesus i thought the bible said year god's who the word of the lord comes to and the prophet of god tells us he said with the holy ghost inside of you he said that's deity dwelling and dwelling inside of you so where is that word being made flesh now it's being made flesh in me and you amen because that's our mandate that's our call in the end time is as brother bob and the different ones we've all kind of got on the same page a little bit but that's good because it's the time it's the time for that sure there's a time we still got people we need saved that are lost and all these different things but there's a time that we have been predestinated we're going to read it today to adoption all right which is placing not just in your birth and this afternoon um not this morning but this afternoon i'm going to do what i said i was going to do because your placing is not your birth there's a new birth and then there's an adoption or the placing or the manifestation and there their you can have the new birth without being adopted but you can't get adopted without having the new birth amen and the new birth is the birth of the word inside of your heart it's the lord jesus christ residing in your soul not just temporary amen we're okay with that but remember when he left here he gave a commission that he was going to have a bride on the earth a body that was going to continue his ministry his ministry wasn't over when he when he uh ascended no that's just when he got started and it had to be started in what man in human flesh with god inside of him right that's kind of the way jesus was except remember we're born of carnality and he was not born of carnality but he came to what bring it all back or redeem us back to our inheritance remember i the quote that i that i love that you that you i can almost quote it verbatim in the adoption series where brother branham said that jesus didn't come to give you an inheritance and boy when you preach that to people that are not well taught they'll look at you cross-eyed have that furrow in between there you know what think about it jesus didn't come to to give you an inheritance our bible tells us that our inheritance was in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world amen so that's where our inheritance was we just got lost from it jesus christ had to come down to what bring you to your inheritance jesus said i am the way the truth and the life right what was he doing he was making a way i am the door i am the way he kept telling us that he was the passageway from life from death and to life but that inheritance was not developed down here redemption was but redemption was before the foundational world too but your inheritance was that your name was put on a lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world if you are the bride of jesus christ that's a big if it's a big word if you're born again your name was written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world the eternal section so for what let's go to colossians 1 and let's continue on and he is the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence now look that word up and we'll look in the greek lexicon that is to be first or hold the first place now do we do that with god do we give him first place in everything no we don't if you do i want to you need to come up here but we're heading toward that though we're heading to that it's not something insurmountable it's not something we can't get to jesus said be there for perfect this my father in heaven is perfect growth development as we were talking about last sunday you know little mordecai was mortified when i brought him up here but but he had all his faculty to drive a car but because of his immaturity that's why some of us you know it's not bad for marty at nine years old to be immature when you're 49 and immature we got a problem okay but that's what god does too god says okay you're a baby i don't expect you to do all these things i don't expect you to handle yourself or conduct yourself like somebody that's been in the you know been born again for 30 40 years but he does expect us to grow he gives us the tools to grow in grace and knowledge but to be the first or to hold the first place do all things that we you know the bible says seek ye first what the kingdom of heaven what we were talking about last night what is the kingdom of heaven the baptism of the holy ghost the promise and that's what gets you into this line of adoption you're just dad many years ago he said look he said satan god's not going to adopt satan's kids he adopts his own kids and man so he must have children and having children we are in the line of adoption let's continue on a little bit further romans 8 verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for you have not received now look you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear i'm i i'm cautious uh we talk about ukraine in different things you be cautious about what you see and what you hear because there was something on facebook the other day that showed people standing out in this field and here comes these rockets and here comes these jets and boom boom boom and bam bam bam and it told about this rocket and that rocket and this patriot missile and that going on and and i thought man that's pretty neat that you could sit there and watch that you know it's all out war well i've walked in church wednesday night and joe brother joe canada said did you see that i said yeah he said it was fake it was a video game that somebody had superimposed people standing in front of it watching and it was a stupid video game so do we believe everything we see you better not hey man you better not and then somebody you know somebody start the phone starts ringing when he's talking about nuclear well that's my point have you received this is everything something fearful to you the prophet of god told us and i am going to everybody believed brother brown was the prophet amen god sent a prophet in the end time okay just want to make sure we was talking to the same crowd anyway but he said not one bomb nuclear bomb would hit this earth while the bride's still here so i don't care they can talk about all this nuclear this and nuclear that folks put that fear away put that fair away but now the only fear you better have is whether you're born again or not because if you're born again you're under that pavilion you're under that shelter and you will take a rapture before that happens so don't worry about it phones goes to ringing people did you hear lord mercy all they done was bombed a place where they made nuclear um whatever it was and power plants what it was come on quit wasting time let's don't be and i say silly women i read that scripture a lot in my head and it's not you silly women you see what you already started laughing before i was going to tell you what it was but it's bride it's the church silly women pulled away from every little something that goes on everybody goes to the bomb shelter and won't come to church this is my shelter this is my pavilion that god has given me a place to come to listen folks do you have fear when you come here that ought to shed at the door you should have no fear here oh i'm afraid that no don't be afraid god's given us a resting place he's given us a kingdom that listen you know what we're not gonna need new nuclear fuel the bible said the lamb's alike the lamb will produce all the light we need but you know what he's got little bitty lights he's got me and you to shine the light down here and before i get any further the bible study next we have it for first saturday of every month from six to eight next week next month we have a topic it is the rapture the millennium and the future home we're gonna take all those three topics and discuss them and if you have any questions about them write them down for those of you that don't come i don't mean that bad but those of you that can't come we do record it and and i think brother joe didn't put it online so you can you can i know people can't get there on saturday night so that's okay we have people that live a long way from here that couldn't come and then go back so we understand that so that's why brother joe and and the technicians they've always recorded what we what we say it's totally informal drink coffee drink a coca-cola sister gabby brings us some glorious wonderful lots of stuff to eat and so does sister trudy man brownie's in the millennium i think that's the next thing we're going to talk on chocolate and german chocolate cake nobody's yet to bring me a german chocolate cake at bible study though so that's okay that's all right didn't even get one for my birthday i'm gonna ramble on romans 8 verse 14 for as many as they're led by the spirit of god look they are the sons of god and really brother louise wednesday night just he just nailed it on the head to help you realize all those things that are positive already happening now are we the sons of god now but we've got to go to the part that says waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god so there's a waiting period or a placing like morty morty can't drive a car it would be a disaster but that same guy if the lord tarries another eight years he'll be 17. he'll be able to drive a car because he has come to some point of maturity and then he passed the test that the state of georgia said you got to pass this test before you can drive you got to show these skills well that's what we've been talking or getting ready to start talking about is start using those skills that you have and man same way we were talking about the other day about going to school use the skills that you were given in school amen same way here for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby you cry daddy daddy or abba father we all become babies we all start as babies every christian that's ever started has started a baby except the 120 in the upper room because they were tutored and trained by god himself for three and a half years right so they were a mature church peter walked straight out says this is that and then just a few days later he's walking through the courtyard and he sees this guy and he can't walk he said silver and gold have on none where did he get that from he got the power and authority listen god had already given them jesus christ had already given them authority to cast out devils do all those things while he was here and then when they got the holy ghost they know now how to use it justification sanctification by the time you get to the holy ghost you ought to know at least a little bit number one that you're in the family and number two that god's gonna use you he's just not gonna let you sit there and drop as a baby unless you want to take the bottle little cambrie back there man she's so little she's so fragile but give her about another 20 years oh lisa and terence will be old give you another 20 years and she'll be this beautiful blonde i hope girl that's been through college hopefully by then and you understand what i mean that's the same way with god but i was reading a quote just a few minutes ago well this morning the the only difference in me and you though is we don't know what our kids are going to do we just give them the best guidance and we give them the best care and we send them to school we buy their books we give them car gas money and all that stuff blah blah blah and but god knows where you're going we don't know where our kids naturally are going but god knows where his kids are going therefore he can place you in a place in a teaching ministry or a evangelical ministry or or this ministry of that ministry we'll read it here in a few minutes but i just don't think that sitting under a evangelistic message all the time you're not going to come to adoption because the bib because brother around said teaching places you now there's your placing it doesn't it doesn't you can get listen like brother brown said you can put an egg under a dog and it'll it'll hatch but it's going to realize who it is after a while hey man it's going to look funny remember the eagle and all that in the barnyard the eagle looked a little funny why because he was different but he was born in the chicken yard amen for as many are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god we already read that all right let's go now we're going to talk about headship in just a few minutes and let's read what brother brown said on the layout to see in church age number one but now he's standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of god this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself god's going to make sure he has adult children he's going to because he already saw it by four knowledge by predestination he's already saw what was gonna happen you and i just gotta fall in line know our position that's what we'll talk about this afternoon this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church our bride if he's the beginning of the creation you and i are the rest of that creation amen the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride now i took a little bit out at the same time i took one paragraph i'm sorry i am not editing brother adam just for time brother brown says about two paragraphs later this is the true revelation of god what is the true revelation of god that he's going to have a church a bride it's going to be his and not the devils it's not going to be the nomination it's going to be the bride that's just the way he's going to have it because he's already seen it happen you've just got to figure out whether you're a part of it or not search your own salvation with fear and trembling the bible tells us all right let's look too there's two or three things we were talking about the other day and one was dispensation i know the prophet of god said he was a dispensationalist but in the bible says in the dispensation of the fullness of time so whoever wrote the bible must believe in dispensations you and i always we believe in dispensations or stages i've got it wrote our anointing there's a different anointing for a different for your different age because remember luther and wesley luther's anointing was that just shall live by faith he could sit in a pub and drink beer and smoke a pipe and talk about god and be born again you can't do that different dispensation different stage of god's word and it's a different anointing same god thank god as we were talking last night we were talking about angels and guardian angels listen it's the same god it's just different anointings and and and i believe we do have guardian angels my sister is beat all the pieces because he slaps me in the back of the head all the time but it's not a different god it's just a different anointing jesus got an anointing for his ministry on the river jordan that didn't make him god he was god when he was born the bible said he was born emmanuel god with us and on the river jordan he was what he was anointed for a three and a half year job to do a ministry to do and then the prophet of god tells you i believe it's in the in this same series yes it is in the adoption series he said the spirit left him in the garden went out the spirit left him in the garden he died it was an anointing that left him that same anointing that came on him three and a half years ago that anointing came off of him so he could die because without anointing on him he could not die many times you read where whether he slept through the crowd or they were gonna they they took him out was gonna throw him off a cliff he just changed their eyesight and walked right through among them just like elisha did and geheza when they changed the syrians eyes and there stood elisha they said who are you looking for we're looking for elijah hey we're looking right at him and we're looking right at elisha and he so fooled him he said oh i know where the army is at and he takes them down in the middle of them and god opens the syrian's eyes right in the middle of the camp and there was no battle god had already won do y'all realize that god does that to the devil he does that to the devil he lets the devil think he can do anything he wants to with you and all of a sudden he'll put you in a situation and he'll say oh look devil what do you do with job job wasn't wasn't making any noise at all he was just doing what god said to do and god said have you considered my servant job he actually took satan's his attention and put it on job but see he's so blind to joe he's so blinded satan though because satan thought yeah i'll make him curse you and die i'll make him curse the day he was born well he pretty much almost did but he never cursed god and then when he got to the very end of it satan was like well you he needs to just die the lord said no i'm gonna give him double what he had to start with you think he was successful the first time you saw him you just hang around a little while i'm gonna make him successful again same way with me and you all the trials and tribulations that we go through last night we had a real good testimony service people testified how god had been with them through their life and the different things they've done or been or been taken away from well you know what that was god that was god doing that for screwing angels i believe in angels i just believe there's all bunches of them there's bunches of angels all right but they're all put here the bible says for the heirs of salvation to guide you and direct you i just that's just the way i see it you may see it a different way but that's okay but look we believe in dispensations and stages and anointings and then what will happen is and i bring the quote this time but the prophet of god tells us he said he said here's the box and this is the church ages he was talking about the church he said each church age had an anointing and they couldn't do anything but go by that anointing luther couldn't preach wesley's message wesley couldn't preach pentecost message the people took this message and were sealed in the next one took him were sealed in next one took him were sealed well guess which one we're in we're in the box of adoption where we have to come to maturity listen we've got all the resources that none of the other ages had look at the resources we have uh we can put the message on our on our watch and this whole wall used to be when this church was first started that whole wall was eight inch reels you couldn't carry hardly one in a pocketbook and now you can carry all 1100 of them plus the bible in 26 translations on your phone on your on your phone on your apple watch well then what are we doing about it there's no excuse for us to say i can't carry all that whole bunch of books around or i can't carry them eight inch reels everywhere i go and then see remember though the tape player was this big it wasn't just eight inch reels you had to have a tape player some of you are shaking your head because that's what we came through i mean the thing was this big and you turned it on and you carly couldn't hardly couldn't hear it and but look at now we've got everything we need but but once god gives it to us he requires that we use it we can't have any excuse because we've moved from dispensation of the holy ghost and even the dispensation of god sent a prophet i believe brother brown said this is a bright age i believe that he said this is the brown age so we moved into the bride age not negating brother brown listen there's no way you can understand anything without that man coming i don't know why in the world people want to want to nick pitt and nick pick him he took me to god he showed me god more clear than anybody has ever shown me god amen and every time i read stories and read all the things that he that he's talking about i get a clear picture of this god that i'm serving amen that's why but we don't turn our face always to the prophet though the prophet jesus christ but we heard him through that trumpet but now listen your mandate and my mandate now is to make that become alive because without making it coming alive come alive it was in vain and god won't do anything in vain he didn't send a mighty man on this earth just for no purpose at all he sent it so that me and you could receive this message from god and be able to talk to god more clearly than anybody's ever been able to talk to god even the prophets in the old testament they wanted to see god like me and you see god today listen to this we talk about dispensations questions and answers on the seals we've already read this but let me read it again everybody all right kind of slowing down a little bit you know background a little bit more that's okay we got plenty of time brother branham he's he's preaching the seals the most powerful messages he said he's ever preached in his life come in march of 1963 when the lord i believe adopted that man and give him the keys gave him the checkbook and whatever he wrote that's what it was going to be the seals opened to the prophet and he preached six of them and he was having questions and answers on the seals you see it behind me and brother brown comes to the seal to the six to after he preached the six seals he said okay we're gonna have questions and answers tomorrow he said i don't want any questions except about the seals because that's why you've been preaching for six days in a row and the greatest i mean the headstone message was back it was there and they asked him could they wear pantyhose or pajamas to bed they asked him about the name of the lord jesus christ in baptism they asked him about only two questions out of 20 or 30 questions about the seals so he knew they weren't getting it and this is what he's going to tell them right here and i know you that you don't see it see i'm just positive that you don't see it you say brother brown that's a hard thing to say i know but look let me just say this now i suppose this is taped and we know it is you don't get it and you're not supposed to get it so don't try to interpret anything see don't try to put your interpretation to it you'll only get further away that dispensation was what restoring of the gifts the prophet to god was restoring true worship just as elijah did and on mount carmel he restored the altar he restored he put the worship back together he brought the name of the lord jesus christ and baptism back in power he brought the trinity that it was no good all the different doctrines he had brought him to this place right here and he was saying okay you can get that you've got that that's your dispensation because if you'll continue with this quote he says there's voices and images running through this building right now back and forth and there is today more than it was then images running through this building he said if you had the right crystal diamond if you had the right crystal you could pick up what was let me just put it in my own words brother ryan was saying look you're not here to get it because you don't have the right crystal it's not saying you don't have the new birth but you don't have the right crystal to pick up the right signal because you're in this dispensation they weren't in the dispensation of adoption they were still pentecostal babies sorry to say but that's what brother brown said pentecostal babbling babies and he knew though but he didn't he didn't just throw the baby out with the bathwater he said go on and live a simple christian life is the rest of the quote because you'll get twisted away from it because it's not your time to see it but folks let me say one thing's for sure thus saith the lord this is the time the crystal is here now the right people are in the right place at the right time you and me i'll read a quote next week brother brown says brother and sister he talks about adoption time we're going to pour out an anointing on this church on this bride of jesus christ there'll be an anointing that's coming and it's still it's here i believe but he said what you've seen in part part hundreds of thousands of people healed innumerable innumerable amount of people raised from the dead and he said that's part you know why because it was one man now we've got a bride in ukraine we've got a bride in a hundred and whatever country that we got bride there that miracles are happening every single day amen and greater this than you will do jesus said because i go to my father and now where's the father in you all right so let's move on a little bit so don't interpret it he said because you'll get further away from it he laid it out in that message that there's a group coming with the right kind of crystal that's been taught right let's come to maturity because as as i was speaking a couple weeks ago you will never understand that the all the revelation of the seven seals without coming to adoption that's just the way it is that's just the way the dispensations fall that's just the way the stages are immature christians cannot understand the seals because the seals is given for what the redemption of your body not to save you not to save you there's not a salvation issue but if you're sitting here today and you are in the same place you were when you first got born again that you got malnourished somewhere somewhere you didn't get sheep food and we've all wasted our time okay we've all wasted our time in different places and different things and different i wasted mine in the world okay but thank god he called one time and i answered that one and so did you amen you know why because everybody's got to be in the right place at the right time the actors have got to be on the stage your writers are going to have to be where they are your your anointing is going to have to be exactly where it's at and and i know luis i'm going to tell you anyway have you ever seen them watch the movie stargate louise always it's on netflix just i'm just kidding but anyway there's a gate that goes between heaven and earth and this guy finds it but what has to happen he has to do things you see how the devil is imitating god through these movies but i watched this long time ago not not recently but anyway something would happen and and part of that portal would turn well when it turned it's almost like a have you ever watched people open an old safe there's there's tumblers inside when you stop at this one point a tumbler goes down then it turns the whole thing around to the next place a tumbler drops and you turn it back this way and what it's doing is turning all those rings well that's what happened i believe that's what's happening with us there's a portal between heaven and earth between mortal and immortality and then there's a gate there jesus said i'm the way the truth and the life and we if we don't understand him we're not going but what happened was as the guy went through his life that thing would turn and it would catch when it would catch it would take the second ring around it would catch and then finally he got to enter in you look at those things you say man well that's what kind of what's happening to us we have to come to a position don't go out past the program of god come on brother brown said scrap heap of ministers stay in our place stay in our position stay in our revelation stay with what's going on now ever present god listen we know we know more about the future than the world does we know more about the future than the world knows you can listen to cnn 10 in whatever you want to listen to but we know more about what's going to happen the reality of what's going to happen than the world knows so that's why we shouldn't have the fear that we have when people start jumping up and talking about nuclear and all this other stuff just keep moving keep moving ephesians 1 verse 4 says according as he has chosen us now look in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us into the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to his good pleasure of his will so that's us that's now he's chosen us in him that we can understand now not just the son of god but the son of man we understood why that man stood on earth and said what he did nobody else did even the apostles scratched their head a lot of times so now let's go to the next part let's kind of rush through this a little bit try to get done here in a minute to the word obedience that's what we were talking about the other day let's read the quote in 1963 from the token the token is a sign that the purchase has been made look made and been accepted made and been accepted you're born again and then you have to come on into adoption or being accepted or moving further along part of the growth part process listen our problem is we're not obedient our problem is we're not praying we're not letting him have total preeminence that's our issue and i'm talking about me not you you got to decide for yourself but that's why we're still here but what brother brown says look the token is a sign that the purchase has been made and been accepted jesus on the rebel jordan this is my beloved son and whom i'm pleased to dwell didn't say here ye him he had three and a half years of a ministry to grow the bible said he grew in grace and knowledge and was obedient he didn't bypass it he had to go through it just like me and you go through it but then then you come to mount transfiguration it's kind of funny that it had to happen on the mountain that jesus goes upon a mountain and god says this is my beloved son whom i'm pleased to dwell hear ye him it's time for you to listen to what he's going to say and brother brown said six months later he was dead but that's what he was heading toward he was heading toward calvary but obedience is part of your growth period if mordecai or morty as we know him if he's obedient what's the first thing we do when our kids are not obedient we punish them we take something away from what i'm sorry i'm sorry you don't whip them anymore that's our problem it is a problem you're right but anyway if you whip if y'all whip them like we got whipped back when we was younger y'all be in jail we used to get beat with with leather straps brother and sister god bless you amen i got whipped one time by principal and he happened to know the local barber and that long piece of strap that hung down from the barber's chair that he sharpened his um blade with it met flesh one day but i'll never forget it i may not have remembered exactly what i did but i'll never forget that weapon because buddy that leather strap was this wide and heavy and when he went back he didn't just go okay johnny no it was the full force of a principal that was probably my size at the time and that's the way god is but he does it with nail scarred hands but he does give you a whipping because we are not we're disobedient and that's what we got to work on now look now you can't get the token from the railroad as brother dale's always said you can't go and get a ticket to the radios to the i mean to the to the bus station and then go down to atlanta to get on an airplane wrong position wrong revelation it's going to be revealed to you all right when you get down to the airplanes out to the hearts field and you hand them a ticket for um for the thing that goes by here what is that amtrak they're gonna look at you like you're crazy because you probably are if you went down there with a ticket to the what it wrong place wrong time wrong position you've got the wrong revelation but now the person that buys the ticket and says oh i got to be on the train at 7 45. you know what they go to the train station that's the same way with me and you now you can't get the token from the railroad fair until you pay the price and the only way you're going to pay the price is pay it that's right believe it except that full obedience to the whole word of god will entitle you to the token full obedience not the part of it as far as your denomination goes but all of it full obedience to the word which is christ brings you into christ let's continue on full complete obedience scroll down down a little bit further full complete obedience puts you and the word one the word was made flesh that's you we know what happened 2000 years ago but that happened 2000 years ago so he could do it again and me and you you believe it every bit and all of it's in you and you watch it working through you all right let's continue on to the next quotes which is questions and answers or read a few quotes here and then we'll then we'll stop for a little while we must look at stature and growth development so let's go to questions and answers 1964. and let's look at this and this is another shocker that that we we know that let me kind of background for the for the for the people that haven't been here in a while and the new ones you we come to brother brown's message started out in the 40s 47 and he started a work of what restoration everybody okay with that restoring i said restoring the church we're starting the order back restoring worship back he you know he smacked the pentecostals on the wrist and said look speaking in tongues is okay but this is how you do it gifts of this this is how you do it he was putting the church in order and he brought the people back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers back in the first church age everybody with me all right then he's got to take these babylon pentecostal babies that he's got in his congregation and he's trying to make him mature he's good he's going to feed him a little more meat instead of the milk that he's been feeding them everybody okay with that and that's when we get to the seals where where the prophet of god that is the headstone message of that prophet remember the messenger of malachi 4 is to do two things this is in the church age book what number one fulfill malachi 4 right hearts of the children back to the fathers all right and then number two according to revelation 10 7 he's to bring the seals open the seals and open up the thunders that will literally turn us back what it's going to literally turn this thing back they didn't nobody get a body change in that first part of brother adam's ministry but in the second part of his ministry today we're looking at a body change we're looking at what we're going to read in probably another month now will be to wit the redemption of our body romans 8. but we got to get to this part first we got to get to the everybody wants to get to that part everybody wants to go from kindergarten to teaching in college in 15 minutes or less not knowing that they got to go through school they gotta learn their abcs what it's the same way in god i told you a long time when we started this series look at your life look at life and that's how god deals with you there's no other way he can deal with you except how you can understand i can't understand brother donnie he lived a different life than i did but god did because god was there with him and god knows how to handle brother donnie better than i know how to handle him amen so let god do it let him take us up that listen he's gonna have to pull us up that statue of a perfect man he's not gonna push us like i said last sunday if you ever tried to push a rope it will not go where you want it to go you push a rope and it'll go wherever it wants to but you pull it and it'll go where you want it to go so he's pulling us up that statue of a perfect man but look at his questions and answers 1964 they asked him said brother adam are you the son of man that's what the question is i didn't put it on there save time but he says i am not he now what did i tell y'all a long time ago when we first started this series the characteristics of the son of man the son of man is he was virgin born that knocks everybody else out every prophet that ever coming in in the whole bible we're all born from sex brother around him included so he can't be the son of man there's only one the son of man and that's the lord jesus christ that was born without sex virgin born okay so let's knock that out there's not another man then that's the son of man but now collectively the bride in the last time end time it's supposed to be the son of man according to what brother brown said why because it's god in human flesh again back in a group of people not in just one man so brother adam was right he said i am a son of man revealing the son of man and that was that's what his real message was now we're not for our visitors we're not the group of people that kicks out 47 to 63 and says well he didn't know what he's talking about we're just going to take no 47-63 if you just jump up the rung of the ladder to 63 to see you won't understand what he's talking about that's going from kindergarten to being a tenured college teacher in 15 minutes or less that's not the way it is we take the whole message i get seed in 47 and i get seed in 65. amen and i don't differentiate because god will take you to where you need to go amen but he said look now watch he said i'm not he i'm his servant look and the pillar of fire is not he now you would think but now listen the characteristics of the son of man though is is that is god in human flesh the pillar of fire that stood between brother branham and all those people that he prayed for and discerned for the pill of fire they used to see all the time if that's not the son of man because it's not god in human flesh that was a dispensation folks now listen that pillar of fire is inside of me and you now that same anointing now not the prophet part not to and listen we talk about discernment just looking at y'all's face i can deserve what you're thinking i don't need to get into your brain we're not getting anywhere but there was a dispensation where the prophet of god stood and discerned people out that was a dispensation to get the people to what what did he say that was he'd say that was the message he said that was debate on the hook what is the hook the hook was the message debate was the signs and wonders but it was supposed to turn to people to get them to listen to this message some did some didn't happening now i mean it's really it's nice to to uh i think they put out a tape not too well several years ago of just brother brown's prayer line and that's okay but that ain't going to change you that ain't going to take you to adoption i'm sorry it's not teaching is going to take you to adoption the preaching of the gospel by a human mortal man it's going to take you to adoption but the pillar of fire is not he it's in spirit form the son of man is not in spirit form jesus was not in spirit form when he was on the earth he was a human that had flesh like me and you he heard he groaned he ate he cried and he died but it's in spirit form which was upon the son upon the son of man and has come now to anoint sons of men to bring back a ministry just like he said it would be who's he god in order for the head and the rest of the body to connect together just like the pyramid look here's the quote i want to get to the headstone's yet to come what is the headstone it's the bride jesus is not going to be here in human flesh until the millennium right so where is he going to be if the headstone's yet to come and it's coming and it's here it's got to be in the bride it's got to be in sons and daughters of god and not a one-man show anymore the headstones yet to come let's go to galatians 4. i'm going to fly through this real quick because i'm going to have to because this afternoon i got to get to something so let's go to galatians 4 verse 1 now and i say that the heir as long as he's a child difference nothing from a servant all right you're born again that makes you a child of god everybody's saying man or old me one of the two okay the ones you that sleep can say it later then an heir as long as he's a child different nothing from a servant though he'd be lord of all what's he saying he is not going to take that boy that's just being born i can walk now they got they got the cameras on they're not gonna take this boy i'm not tethered anymore cause i got a camera right back under there y'all didn't see that one so we can run down this aisle further than we ever did i before get to the second poll i think brother joel got to the first poll i'm gonna get to the second poll one of these days i just lost my thought no i'm just kidding so when we come to it when we come to the new birth you become a son and daughter of god you can't get out of that if you're born again you can't get away from it all right god's not an indian giver right and i believe once they've always saved if you're really saved the first time amen but not that you get saved and never show up in church again it's a big difference there but look what did that say that says he differs nothing from a servant god's not going to take you though when you get born again and he's going to say here's a car keys just like we did with with mordecai and brother john's car keys that he about wrestled him down to get the car keys from but i mean that's true though you take mordecai as a newborn baby in christ he's got all the ability to i mean all the to drive eyesight ears hands feet but give him the keys to your car brother you got your car today right okay i don't want to embarrass you some people fall out when you call them out but there's a little boy back there nine years old can you give him your car keys let him drive you home that's the same way with god and i was and and literally if his daddy's sitting beside of him back there he's your son right he's not somebody else's son listen god loves you to be a son he loves you to be a child but he don't love you to stay a child i love my kids they're 30 eight oh and my baby's 35. well she still lives at home but anyway um that's not normal i shouldn't have went there but you think about though how you feel think about how i feel but think about pray for me but think about though god having a child and for 35 years you stay in the same place think about it now there's no way i can do it i'm glad hannah's not here i'm there's no way i'll do away with my daughter she's my daughter regardless she's got my blood and my wife's blood flowing through her veins right same way with god you're just as eternal as god is when you become a son and daughter of god but in this end time there's a requirement that we grow up and not stay at home for 35 years no grow up have a family get a job get out remember what i said i hope sister gayle's watching together brother dick our old song leader he's passed on now but he told me he said i tell my kids he said remember two two numbers 18 and 30. when you're 18 years old you got 30 days to get out of my house yeah bro boyd said again glory but i'm gonna tell you something though brother dick's got three of the best kids i've ever seen in my life that you know what though they made it on their own now listen god's gonna not god's not gonna throw you out there and let you make it on your own at least he's the father that's gonna be with you all the time so that's what's going to happen but now when he started when this child started in this kingdom he was put with the servants though he be lord of all though daddy knows that if he does everything perfect and everything right he's going to get that kingdom one day but he don't give him the kingdom at the time same way with god we're put under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come now god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law we know that was jesus christ to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart crying daddy daddy or abba father father father wherefore they are no more a servant but a son all right i become a son now he's separating me a little bit from the world because he's teaching me things i've come to a position since then an heir of god through christ let's read these couple of quotes and then we'll we're going to have to stop because i've got another hour left here and we have church at two o'clock so we can't do that for those of you that travel we do that so let's read the next one and then we'll set the basis for this afternoon this is the prophet of god 1954. he says i just love teaching oh my i think it's wonderful it gives look the basis and settles the church why wouldn't you want to be in a church that was settled okay i've been in some that weren't they have good teaching because what brother brown said look number six adoption series now preaching usually catches the center we listen we believe in a five-fold ministry there's no doubt you all know we believe in the five-fold ministry we have brothers come in that fulfill the five-fold ministry all right now preaching usually catches the sinner brings him under conviction or condemnation by the word but but teaching places a man positionally what he is now that's what our mandate is positionally place us and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know where we are or what we are or where we're supposed to be let's skip that next quote read this other one magicians come on we'll get to the three stages of adoption this afternoon but let's read this quote number eight which is the next one after seven keep going it's kind of long number eight all right now what is adoption now let me get this now i don't know whether i won't have time to get through this but i'll hit it then if there's a question you can ask me a little later on something in the message sometimes listen your adoption is not your birth your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing and that's what we're going to talk about this afternoon placing how how that joshua placed the people in the promised land how he placed all those children of israel as we were talking about last night what a wonderful analogy that there was two tribes and a half tribe state on this side justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and in those three ages luther wesley and pentecost there was no way they could come to adoption but there was a half tribe of manasseh that he went on over into the promised land now what is the promised land we know it's the holy ghost but it's also where they were placed and they're placing we were talking about this last night you know how they got placed their mothers at their birth screamed out their name and brother brown said that's where they were positionally placed i asked him last night i said okay your mama not your natural mama your spiritual mother when she gave birth to you she placed you you just don't realize it yet that's what happened in the natural but also what happened in the spiritual when you get born again there's replacing but maybe we haven't realized maybe it takes some good teaching or maybe it takes some good preaching to bring that out and show you not worry maybe not even where you're going to be but where you are how many times have you looked at that dream that brother branham had about brother ed biskell remember the green checking shirt now brother biscuit told us personally he said i was in that vision for hours hours before i looked down and realized that i had on the shirt that the vision was now what about me and you we've been in this vision a long time let's come to a realization that we've had that green checky shirt on the whole time let's read the adoption series right here real quick your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing when you were born again john 1 17 i believe when we're born of the spirit of god we are the sons of gods everybody got that say amen but we were predestinated now here's what i'm trying to get you to for the sons of the last day we were predestinated unto adoption now now here we are listen this will hurt pentecostal a little bit this will hurt people in the message that stayed pentecostal a little bit sorry they say i got born again praise the lord god the holy ghost brother brown said fine i'm not doubting that he said you're a child of god that's right but yet that ain't what i'm talking about thank god for a southern prophet that can say ain't but yet that ain't what i'm talking about see you were predestinated unto adoption adoption is placing a son not the birth but the placing and he's given us the ability to be placed in the end time we heard we heard the end time message we have now become the end time message there is no other message besides this message and we're a part of it so what does it call our call is for adoption let's stand our feet that's our call not another one it's our mandate to grow up in god and come to full adoption where our name is as good on the checkbook as the fathers i thank god for a prophet that told us he said now when you first get born again he said god signs the check whatever you need you tell god what you need he signs the check because you know what if it ain't right he ain't going to sign a check i've told you how many times god's nose are the best guesses you ever get if god tells you no you better believe that there's something going to happen in your life that's going to go wrong and god's already seen it because he's infinite so his know is the best yes you'll ever get but he'll come to a time where he'll say that's my boy that's my son that's my daughter they're acting right they've come to a place where now i can give them gifts in the body i can give them discernment and gifts of healing and all these other gifts and then one day he's going to give us a gift i'll speak in the word and the dead is going to come out of the ground all our loved ones that have gone before they're waiting on me and you adoption time when god can pour in his fullness into me and you [Music] amen i am the resurrection in the life where is that at that's inside of you we can't we're not waiting on jesus to come back down here in human flesh to call for the dead saints to come out of the ground we which are alive in the rain until the coming of the lord shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep for the trumpet of god your sound this is the trumpet the shout the voice the trumpet that's what we're living under now oh god you love him [Music] me [Music] within me singing [Music] restore unto me [Music] one more time [Music] let's worship him today give him all praise and glory oh god [Music] we've met the father and he's given us all these gifts [Music] he created this bride another designation of himself to act just like him when we act like the world [Music] holy spirit from me and it's your prayer today or the joy of thy salvation and renew our right spirit within me cast me not away oh created me a clean heart he's a creator [Music] and he created a part of him when you come to the new birth [Music] he created sure he created the world with that same creator created inside of you [Music] a part of him genesis 126 he's being fulfilled he's got children and he wants to adopt his children he don't want to adopt the children of the world he wants to adopt his own children that's [Music] come on folks that's the that's the cry for today is to come to full adoption so we must come to obedience and we must give him preeminence if not then we're just going to stay here we're just going to keep dying we're just going to keep getting older but our mandate is to give god preeminence in everything we do sing it to him [Music] me [Music] but oh to her just listen to her and then help her [Music] oh [Music] okay you ready to pray this sister is asking lord for her family [Music] lord to have a family member lord that's not doing right and we know it's just the devil lord so i pray in the name of the lord jesus that when these cloths go on our sister lord they'll take that thing away in the name of the lord jesus christ and our sister binds with me lord that this thing's not going to harm us anymore lord we're not
