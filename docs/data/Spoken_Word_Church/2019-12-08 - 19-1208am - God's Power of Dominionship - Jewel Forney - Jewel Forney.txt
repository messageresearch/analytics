good to be a Christian by God grace and I just I want to thank the Lord this morning I'm gonna write to the word Lord I'm not gonna keep you too long you know how my style entertaining you can't kill it all in one day he did it all in one day some phrase guys I'm gonna read from two places in the scripture this morning Genesis 1 and also Colossians 1 this morning ever started in Genesis Genesis 1 and our started verse I probably use the net to write down because I got caught a few scriptures Genesis 1 verse 26 to 28 Genesis 1 yes praise God just one verse 26 through 28 and it reads like this and God said let us make man in our image itravel lightness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the creeping things that creep up on the earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God he created he him male female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth on the earth Colossians 1 first Colossians read from verse 15 and 16 and it says who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him we're all things created that were in heaven and that are in the earth visible and invisible whether they be diminished or dominions or principalities or power all things were created by him and for his grace let us pray my gracious father helped me to heal my body one more time help me - you're my mind my spirit my soul Lord Lord just get out of the way Lord I thought I'd give you all my scrip for this service in the name our Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen god bless you you may be seated in one moment thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God this morning I like the way the Scriptures under God gave man Dominion created everything that were created was created by him and for him so by God's grace I'm taking my call up your game fighting work with a coat on so thank you love it yes and we find here in the book of Genesis here we find God who created man the held dominion ship how do that what man that was a perfect Verbier that we could become God of the ruler God put us in a position now what we've done with it as a good but God it was God will for man to have dominion over the earth how do you not have them complete complete rulership of the earth in other words so when God did this in man with their God put man in a body of flesh so make a rule hello in other word the legal way for man a ruler he had everbody hello so God put God stepped in a body in and gave at him when he took this body and stepped in this body and breathing Adam Adam II had dominion over the earth Holly we we look here we find here that in the scripture here that when God first created man how the man had he the rule over the fish of the sea over the fowls earlier and every living thing that move up on the face of the earth everything they had everything that was up on the earth everything that had life in it good God say Adam I want you to get dominion over this and anything that I want you to subdue to Earth if anything get out of order put it back in order how do you know what Adam I'm giving you this authority that keep everything in order how would that go do it you would speak the word and it would obey you haloo you double does that was a job you know they have dominion and and then and speak the word and and everything they move in everything that's up on your but we understand here that and I looked at the scripture that when God the first created man was trading God created man in his own image man didn't have all man did was to live it shouldn't be in always in here honey shouldn't be nobody shouldn't be getting older other God in creator's to get old now what we have a problem we get no we trying to make a self thing well I'm going to stay young fail but you show me your solution I'm tell you what Jarrett I won't hold you that is how that stuff is all with you does I do hit a certain point in life into you just get oh you know I mean you think you'd be thinking in your mind I'm gonna I feel just as good as I did when I was 16 you think that that's in your mind every oh this is just that point is just that good but there is something in man he want to stay young he want to feel youthful like he did when he was like 16 or 17 years old and everything but but we all get know her but we were not created to be that way you know when the God created man in I'm gonna do to cover it maybe read a couple of scriptures and I want you to know he never gave man time man never would when God created man his own him it man was created in the image of God created he him male female critic either God never did it man was never in time ha looser than what you find in Genesis 1 and verse 15 here we find her and the Bible said and the Lord God took the I took the man the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden and to dress it and to keep it so he was a keeper and Genesis 1:16 we found her and then he came out of meat were and the Lord God a command gave him a commandment and sanity and and said unto the man of erage a tree under God and I may eat freely if you notice here he never put time in this I want you to eat and I want you to live and I want you to enjoy the blessings of God he never put time in his but if you notice in genesis of 17 chapter of in a 17 verse he said but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil - you're not eat of it for in the day if you notice he put time in this heap let him know in that day in the time you do this that time you started to dive in the day that idea that day - it surely died so he put time in the day time in the pub where Genesis the the 6 he burn able to see freely but now Genesis 17 is day honey in the deluge of hunger that day should surely die in the word so Adam what he was sand Adam Adam you wash you do this you would never live a day in God terminology of the day was as a thousand years that was a thousand years was the other day and Adam today that you do it it will no man live up thousand years on earth so once Adam did I have never lived a thousand you do them little 969 Europe he died before the thousand year ago so we go back and pick up the millennia and live out a thousand your honeymoon and reread Christ cut the scripture can be broken so we begin to go ahead we find her and I look at these things right here in that we v we're going in Genesis here and run you see what my title is the power of Dominion and then were so adamant is dementia so we binder does he remember we always says Holly the devil took the UH the devil took the Adam diminisher that devil did not take Adam diminisher Adam gave it to him I don't want all the way to devil could do it devil could not get to Adam he had to come out to him either what a devil made me do it Holly the devil cannot make you do it you got the Holy Ghost the only way to definitely get to you you you gotta lay go to him here we go he did not come to you except going through the blood and he go through the bloody you'll be a brother that you saw hit him one do that so we begin to let go nothing's right there so but we begin to realize it and then we find here in Genesis so to Devil start talking we know discover here and in this relationship start between him and a heaven Eve then you know you started he start talking to her he didn't never come NAT him he would I knew but the point of it is here and I was studying a scripture here and I noticed here in the scripture you know the Bible says he was guilty of the transgression in the beginning right and you know you know you know but here it is Eve Hickel Satan he came to eat and then beginning to start his relationship with Tommy and in front here she was on Facebook it shouldn't be talking to him no way this intimate having this conversation no way know what she should be talking to her husband and it was somebody anyway but here they were that was in his little devils in his Laura romance going on here between the Serpent and Eve how do but deported me what we say that he was in the transgression she was guilty of the transgression I mean she was but the point of it was if you look at the story right he should had never been in this position you said my brother Joe how would you get there if Adam who had did what God told him to do he would Nellie wouldn't have never been gift is a transmission cloudiness anyway he woulda did did it if he was a ruler the way that God told him to if anything that move upon her you deal with it Adam why didn't he deal with this beast he should have deal with this be striker so evening you should not if his heart would have been order Adam Devine nation I've been in there maybe you said well she was guilty but when you go back to you read in Romans it says they had about one man follow God's it was seeing came into the world about one man rid of one man righteousness into him we come back to that but Adam should deal with this problem he should walked up to the sermon so what you talking to my wife honey oh yeah I don't tell you what I want to speak you out of existence and if he would have had done it Satan would have never been her everybody wouldn't be no ball hitting me as in her if he were to did his job the right way but you shouldn't he shouldn't have never been this away and because I did it Adam didn't rule he didn't take his lordship he didn't take his rulership over to Satan so now I don't have begin I had to deal with a different job he still had to deal rule of beasts he still had to have dominion over the beasts but to be said he dealing with now is different the Beast that he was to deal with the fishes to see a fishing of the cedar for a lady uh things that move on her he's still dealing with that beast he had to had to deal with the Beast that he deal with now is with venom now he still he's still dealing with and we still got to deal with this thing called the Beast how do you say brother joy you said I work what my be stuck I did when you look at it every morning huh every morning you look at this piece every morning you got to deal with so that's so now he it ain't that he it ain't that he didn't had he still had to deal with this beast my hero so now we find her and I'm gonna deal with a few scripture sir how do I get rid of my head you know what let me look at this thing that he got to deal with he's still got a rule the same write him because God put me her to rule the earth and the ruler I will be done in earth as it is in heaven how do you we are if you think God talking about how do you got to deal with this earth right here so then you begin to look at these things right here dad now I want you to notice that like you don't say you're not older people say oh yes I believe them in size I believe that the people that get too bad holy go it's preaching this message to prophet insight and we're done with the messenger prophet comfort so we can catch the mind of Jesus Christ and preach the word on the prophet in science I would man understand the mind of God without a your Norton of God coming up on you by the Holy Ghost how do you be will be impossible for you to sit down and take the Bible and understand about without the baptism the Holy Ghost so now what a probably come to us to take the word and make the word live for your day honey so we all need the anointed a prophet it in sight so we can look in the scripture and see what we come from see what we ain't see what we going and nothing we know what we going honey how can you be lost except you no way you don't know you you had to have a purpose and what you're going on in to be lost in other words so we know where we come from honey so now I'm gonna look at a scripture here so and we begin here Adam had a ruler's beast could we find an adoption book the promise God was saying that God made man to beat up a predominant of all the earth he had Dominion and the earth was man Dominion it is that scripture it is that scripture then if that is his Dominion he was a God all over the earth all over the earth any words you say I know you if you look at here you say what do you mean I've got over the earth honey you don't think your body just come to church of ceinture you got to make your body praise God sometimes come some time you don't even feel like praising God how didn't the soleus say let you raise your hand and praise God how do you a body be saying I don't feel like it but you're gonna do it in a way I don't care how you feel we come to church to praise God it ain't about feeling is about worship praise gotta tell some feeling like was you so there's all day it is it that we gotta make this body honey didn't buddy don't wanna press his body don't wanna do that you got to tell it I'm gonna do it huh you gotta take the minion ship oh I'm gonna do it body well you know praise God if you like it or not you've all right you will say Amen if you like it or not how do we come to church to help pray we come to church let's let God know that we are here now watch the by God hallelujah hallelujah so we begin to think of new things right there so buddy here I'm gonna slow it down for a few minutes to get just just BC gonna rule the same right here that you live in right now don't think don't you never think for one minute they show your friend this is not your friend this is not your friend right here anyway you said hey you know it's not your friend let me go to Romans 7 then looking sup real quick then look at Romans 7 I'm going for 15 to 21 Romans the seventh chapter I'm starting at verse 15 down to verse 21 I'm just watching well I'm so glad I like science I do man sizes all right it got this good plays the tree the tree of knowledge good and evil that would eat garlic baby but it's good it does a good writer I mean to get over it fall he says forget what yeah look which I do a lot not for what I would that I do or not but what I hate that I do and it was we all go to this day right I knew we don't want to be bad people so how do we don't want to hate that Oh beaters way but today normally the thing that we hated and we all normally end up north so he says if for if then I do that which I would not I could send them to the log that is is good and he says then it is no more that I do it but what were they hate ain't no your feeders in in other words you said with the devil here no no you did it with the right girl how do you do gotta come to the conclusion the same that I'm dealing with it's not a girl it's right here so we gotta make a body start gonna come separately the word here so gonna need roses answer he therefore I know that I know you know where I coming today a relationship with God that I know for my enemy day you will already got so bad bro Sam my enemy if I don't make it today because of brother Sam you don't make it today because you didn't get to only go you can't really put this down over your husband the day my wife made me go to hell no your why do you make you go to hell you didn't get you over to your beast on this objection so you say but I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth know what what's good in it it's all we got paying in the eyes do you pass 18 you know you you feel pretty good to you about teeth start getting down there edge a little bit I mean when I was like 16 and 17 years old I did that everybody's always Nance you see me doing that now there's arteritis that ain't no muscle reflection so this says that we realize this thing right here is bodily old AB you know so he says so we might we're just getting out of my Halloween it was law I'm gonna make this beasts obey the word Halloween it works let's go do this a 4/5 know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I found him not how to pause there did he go to the central for the good that I that I I would do that I would did I yeah will do yeah then he says not but the evil which I would not that I do we still get up I don't get do no evil welcome do you got mad cuz that old person pull out in front of you didn't look attitude every time then I mean he said you say you say I ain't got attitude ain't got nothing to get out of juice I never get out of juice you must not be married but here we are you married you don't get an attitude Aaron and it that says legislate and you got the perfect life and it was and she do she got a turn but here we are I believe in love i get in trouble my wife so this is that he said now if I do that I would not it is no more I that do it but sin that little bit me so the Beast has hit me and what causing his problem honey so now I'm gonna find a way to deal with this a writer you know what he said did I neither did I fired a loaded when I would do good evil is present with me he said well I did lie in the law of God I don't know what the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the only one they can rule this be striker how do get is only thing they could take control of this Beach right here so that's the one we got a deal we write up some money get rid of this slice right here that we deal with we dealing weed right here we got to keep it under the power of the Holy Spirit cuz that is a beast sir and I'm gonna show you and you cannot rule this beast without the Holy Ghost and I can prove that to you about the scripture in a few seconds let me uh find my place in the way to show you we just use the scriptures there that we a proper got now here we are we got to get power over the flesh in the word and the flesh right here do not want to submit to God it's the hardest is your enemy and the way it loves and it will feed off the it will feed I'll pledge you quicker than you because when you come to the word right here the word is delayed on the outer and the presented your body as a living sacrifice at me is alive you got to keep it on to the altar how do we want to get up but you gotta say you gotta stay on the altar how do you got to keep it on the altar here hey you pause I beseech you brother that you position as a living sacrifice it alive in every way you got to keep it on the altar you gotta keep it down I everyday bow God daily hellooo in other words so we begin and look at this right now someone um look at this be sure you say I can rule mines well you know what you won't be at a ruler without the Holy Ghost and let me show you how powerful this beast is let us go to James three James three and I'm gonna begin starting at verse 6 Jane the third chapter of James and verse 6 down to verse 8 so I want you to notice here in James they look at this thing right here it ain't bit a little why are your power well Adam power Wars right here Adam had the power to speak the word what was Jesus power man should not live by bread alone but I have a word command above God so the poverty Jesus said it was at the power to speak the word the power Yoda man what man power where today what politics ow even though they do lie it's by the word Shakespeare and you don't you trumping up you're doing sign language he's speaking I mean here's someone saying is all I ain't in the politics I I don't think it at the back part it really because hey how can you probably you put a good man in they come out of bad man anyway so I hope you come on man in City you don't only they never gonna work for people's is the Baptist is another Holy Ghost you know who you know you're dead tears and everybody they got it they got everybody looking at everybody fighting there but in there and they're the problem i hain't taking your money and ain't about that to you but anyone taking your money but here we are hey it just sent way you know whatever but still it's like this so we won't look at this the very thing that we deal with every day and this day right heard that they right here it's just a little bitty thing it really all that bad but they look nothing right during a broke up marriages homes and broke up churches done broke a friendship number up I never injured friend you never probably friendship by looking at a person and there were shows that we here it says him the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue come on Zia members the it defiles how much of the body the whole body in other words if you don't control it it won't wash it right it won't wash you've done it hey hey just bite you got to speak to your body how do you got to speak to your body you got to tell your body this is what I'm gonna do cuz there's a war going on all the time so in other words in that's really it goes it says it defies the whole body and it is set on fire it's set it is set on fire the court course of nature it is set on fire from work this little teeny-weeny thing right here then cause a lot of problems and they don't still cause problems and it was so and then he said for every kind of beasts and birds and of the serpent and things that's in the sea is Tay and then has been tainted mankind but your tongue it says what can no man I mean what you is no me cannot tame this fellow right here so that means is not a job that man can do it take the Holy Ghost that's why you get my hair the whole ego or you would never be able to make this tongue come subjection to the Word of God an it would never want to speak it it would never want to use it Holly but if you ever get the Baptists not only go your tongue will obey the word historian said no man contain the time it is a unruly and full of deadly poison how your tongue and tennis portray and then and then the word in other words the Bibles are wild because they up but the power of life and death he says we really church for my church here to give God praise a miniature I could be churchy to worship God to make my tongue say hallelujah make my tongues I'll I Love You Lord make my tongue praise God made my tongue except a word I'm healed God I live here in the way he gave us his word that we must speak the word and tell our body this is what I'm going to do now you said brother what this thanks I'm from Delaware is a Adele Webber we brought there will bless we got even the father and where will curse we we miss which are may after the love of God so none so we we live in here and we looking at these words and we look at here it's cursing life and death is in the power of the tongue so now you say brother do what do their tongue said we do this thing come from wood the headquarters that control this name now I'm gonna deal with headquarters and then let's deal with the headquarters what is staying coming from what we speaking for me to go and speak from faith are we gonna speak from death okay so we've had him Paul goes in second corinthians verse i i've second corinthians chapter 10 verse four he says paul speaking here what we dealing with what we speak from what we get out work what we get our inspiration from happens at st. corinthians 10 chapter starting at verse four and five paul dealing with the same right here and he says paul saying these words take a trip to ten first denis go to verse four he says for for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to pull it down us i'm unbundle something here Tim Paul says casting down imaginations funny because we can make people sir get imagine that regard in their mind imagine every idea in their mind well you you why do you come to Ike lose you she don't like me or he don't like me at the church its start from that plane then and the tongue go tell somebody else the stance on speaking them thing that's coming from this program right from an imagination which is no reality to it it's something you command it you could go by yourself you just get on the island by yourself highly inappropriate Allen and all of a sudden your imagination seola yeah you thought about that you can get the perfect place and you still got to deal with this you can be there by yourself and nobody that you're not nothing nothing to tip you at all and all of a sudden just thought coming so what did that come from how they come from that realm now how do you don't really come from that room right there it is a you cast down imaginations every high thing that is all this up against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ how do you so we begin to live here we realize here that we've fired him that we got a beast that we gotta deal with now use that brother Joe why didn't you preach all that I preach don't let to say this without the Holy Ghost you can't do it honey is not it without the Holy Ghost you cannot do it now you say brother Joe what would Jesus Christ comfort Jesus Christ come to express the mystery of God revealed Jesus was manifested to live the holy go-behind skin he was he came to the earth not just a short he copped it up to show you what man can do with the Holy Ghost but you think either human lives manifested just to be manifested Holly didn't come as a spirit he dropped his eternal glory he kept not even eternal throne and come down to earth little Lord and he he stepped out on earth so I'm gonna show you what the man can do what the Holy Ghost he wanted to reveal Christ behind skiing man hasn't power about death he said I want to show them they can live it sorry what was he doing that why he had to speak prophecy in Genesis if you notice in Jesus he had just three prophecy because he had to come and fulfill he said now I'm gonna speak prophecy the woman see shall bruise the head of the serpent spoken words the woman's sea shall bruise the head of the serpent so that was a prophecy for because the woman ain't gonna see but she had to have a seat so we are okay so here to start working on this prophecy he said the woman see she bruised the head of the service did he turns around and says I'm gonna curse the earth so what would he do he was making him my body he was making in my body so we me and brought it in and go through a war he's I'm gone understand your brother Danny I've been in down there I have been down there so I'm gonna crush the earth right here and I'm gonna put prophecy over the woman see this curse this curse are gonna help Christ living in it promise here so now we better so daddy started brainy types in the scripture to show you what he's gonna move toward his prophecy and make it come to pass what did he knew he turns around and he said either the woman sees a bruise the head of the sir sir-sir ridden and all of a sudden he bring it probably the path Abraham brought a type of it how they received a body change I did with you all have a baby and several to leverage our but then all of a sudden anybody was chained by young but you said that was the made promises no that was not the main prophecy that will just show you God change our bodies but how do God come down to manifest himself in human skin I'll lose stepped into a stepped into a body quote nine and three means did reveal Christ to Abraham I'll do it anyway sandwich and drunk the glass umbrella and then turn back to whether we are back to back into the invisible realm honey but assuring that Christ will go come step behind human skin how do you be able to eat and drink they didn't go back his eternal glory so did he go through solid they did we realize Abraham have a son we know the story or hide it only thing was were brought in type showing it with God that was his problem the brain that conceived out her and lil Chrysler in a human scheme so Abraham and and Sarah have a son called as it and then as it give you knows him and now and as it became Abraham only begotten son why because the first nature had to die hey it's Mel had to die so God so as you could be born how do you tell my god never recognized that what guy never recognize a Ishmael he only could recognize neighborhood I have to be happy with the top of the new birth its third nature Wow honey his third nature will king magnetized so able to be born honey you're certain age you gotta die so Christ can be bought in you that old beastly nature gotta be done away with yeah Lenny is your bridge oh yeah I'm crazy let me leave me alone it's good being this way so Zoe that was so he had to so now then what happened so they go there they had a son and he became as it became Abraham only only and now you know we would have been judging a man I mean that man you mean oldest son I know his first huh yeah man he is screen he's the screen do man I had no real so we would never knew we were to remember that but God can't remember that I told it all to God on the ciasses Holly so showing the entire he only begotten Son so now we find out now what happened to him did we remember the woman's seed had to have skin on it Holly had to be Christ behind skin so now what it is so to him as it goes a God actually Abraham to give as his only begotten son as a sacrifice i'ma come on man you gonna go ego had to take his own son life how the devil God was going there showing in type yet what God was gonna do father he will take his own son and you didn't if an atonement for the whole world Holly did was so even the Tiber so do we need a little bit and as I say father he's a I see the would I see the knife as he the fire but we're decided by a bomb speak the spoken word the attitude in smoke honey a beloved God will provide for him a sacrifice the power to town release the power of supernatural he spoke the word and he had to come to pass not even thinking about it he said the right word Tyler did Oliver say and he got rid of the slate as it he'll come around Holly were caught into the ticket right that Ram was cut into the thicket you get brother Julius and what was that Randall they either with the type of the crime it was not that forward type that round was the type of crime because that Ram was born without a father without a mother that will create a power that word was all come behind skin the same way that word came behind skin without a father mother that ran tight crisis will have not a father Eva have not a mother it would be the spoken word it brought that type there and never Christ would come and live the holy ghost behind skin that what you hear him much of Jesus for you hear much out of Jesus to you what about thirty years old about thirty years old he come walking down on the river come rope her down on the river sucking shoulder hit with what we're doing Cobb was gonna over shouted a mystery the Holy Ghost in him the tabernacle in the in the spirit became war Halina this is my beloved son who I am well pleased the tabernacle my seve using what kind of skin dd hell what kind of battles in here same one you had Cup he got old you how did he got old to that body was rigging their body got over their body was a man that body feels the same temptation but the Holy Spirit showers shouted because he won't neither understand if you get to Holy Ghost you could beat the devil any place anywhere anytime so he takes that whole ego feels him down under Ella and I mean he goes right into the battle uh-uh-uh he goes right into the into the battle of the desert breed taken back dominion ship over the tongue and you see what he beat the devil with it he put the atom loose Adam lost dominion ship over the tongue Jesus came into God it goes in that goes into the desert and he takes this dominion ship back Satan came to his mind right you mentally cuz you know people get hungry they get crazy anyway you know I read they do man they get real bad I tell you what boy man I tell you what man that's the only time in my wife were getting fuzzies it's the wind I don't like breakfast that much and she loved breakfast so my deal is to try to because she driving we taking the trip if she go to sleep I try to make her sleep in to breakfast is always I tried not to hit no bumps on the road so when she wakes up his stride like 12 o'clock she'll say you treat me how you drinking you went to sleep but now you know says she done been we didn't been together 40 years so she's got nothing got you know she said she just shall we wake up at the right time for her I'd be almost out of town today but one more mile one more City to get dude then we gonna be 40 miles for a 50 mile before we get to the next city didn't gonna be lunch but every time she can't you see like right here I think I got it man she said I know what you think you're doing she don't even think about she's I'm eating breakfast today so I got a pullover Cracker Barrel and get some breakfast and I thought uncle I thought I was gonna pull over Popeye and get some chickens but here we are so we we go through this all damn attitude from but Jesus is that what Jesus was Jesus himself he goes right into his Satan goes right into his mind and begin to deal with his and he done fasted 40 days and 40 nights his stomach is growling like you're he thinking about boo and saying say if you be the Son of God turn these stones into bread and they're worse use your mighty power but Jesus won't lay Express he was not come to use that in that room he come to use the authority that Adams had the authority of the word that makes Satan obey the word anyways what did Jesus say Jesus say Satan don't you even mention not live by bread alone but by every word that was sitting at him I forgot so what was he doing here we read thorn he restored the authority of his lost year how do I take my word and I made Satan get off setting bad that didn't say Cassius I don't you tip the LORD thy God Satan so he taking the words of authority he's not doing no power he's not he's not turning her nothing he not create he's speaking the word sayings that I give you the keynote no no Seder Thalia I I'm not the second person in the Godhead I hit him to God so he reboots Satan who never grows surely sader that I have no word and I want you to notice this you say that was Jesus greatest battle that was not Jesus greatest battle that was a battle but Jesus greatest battle was he must restore the power of his Dominion ship battle power to control his own tongue did power to show the authority so you said what was his great as the battle Cheetahs greatest battle was gas cemani Jesus greatest battle was gas cemani a desert stone he whooped the devil real quick but this time is dealing between his flesh his mental condition and everything and Jesus himself to flush the main part of Jesus did not want had to bear this what you think you'd ask God to see if it be possible let this cup pass for the workers but not the body of a man we're speaking Calibra lie with deaf ears he will I were paying us and he speaking her Oh God he wants to look a father this say did is happen one time he said to say two or three times he did fellow did phases a God if it be possible let this cup pass from me that body did not want to go through this because he knew what it was but he had the order for him to be take this Dominion to Adam lost the power to control astern he gotta give it all to God early at the end of the day he submitted himself and it in submission to his self he said father not as I will but as thou willest he made his body obeyed his confession only made his body when he left gets it but he did not down a crawl he died in Gethsemane he died he Gethsemane well it was he said his word he was surrendered it was over which my body is going to die my body's gonna pay the price oh my God my God why divert second me hallelujah it were his body as a man God left him against him he left him on the cross he died as a man he died as a sin offering how did God separate himself from that scene Hollywood straight to hell for you and me honey but that same power that same God came back I near nor the Holy Spirit quicker than earth again the back to love God the other was standing in the garden again in a glorified body but let me just no say this here that could be all day would you think about this how did Jesus did all this he said God not as I will now will it then we go here they cares him to pallet Hall and all the things to be judged and I want you to notice this you ever thought about this he was being judged and he'll go to the law was that when pallet judged him he says let me say something to you Jesus do you realize I have power to release you academia and what he was saying to Jesus Jesus looking at him says you ain't got no power he was the IDI claiming in dominion ship over the word oh yeah but Jesus saying nobody you have no power power it will you would either have nothing if I didn't give it to you you think you somebody great you ain't got no power without the Holy Spirit Allu you know whenever so he said they is up it was Satan telling that same you them pilot they tell him I got power over you Jesus said no you don't you are the mind abandon ship I'm not into yours I'm gonna control the situation right here you thought about that Jesus was in control of the situation compile it was real if he knows her so what was the law they had in law was did they were gonna have to warn them is gonna be released palette that will release Barabbas or Jesus one of them had to be released that was their own law so they had a law so they tried take up with a law here and what it was palate judges Jesus and his judgment was I find no fault in this man which should have influenced the people's to say whatever the government done that he found no far we might well to let him go but wonder why that they still did not want Jesus they said give us Barabbas higher because we remember her the world of his own that same nature that they had that same beastly nature was owned in the same way even though they were religious under it so they were to have a Myrtle didn't have a word they'd rather have a murder they'd have a man in here to see a man that raised the day a man that cast out Devils they'd rather have a murder than that but the point of it was they didn't do that Jesus chain demise because Palin did not come I mean but robbers were not born the death for the sins of the world he was not the atonement for the world if PAP Gina would have been set free how do it would have broke ever time Tony Edwin subpath Barabbas was not dead adopted Jesus Gina would never die for Barabbas did Gina was the escape goat he had to go to hell so he put it in the horse this ain't give us Barabbas I got power to control this anyway everything of your I got poverty control in Syria so he took control of the beasts he took control of the earth right near Holly needs a given parabola crucified Jesus that won't fold the happy that was a very dangerous they said the right were didn't know who the volume well it's alright God got it all in control just sometimes we don't thank me sometime we look anything or man this is bad look what's happening here but GOG I didn't control do that why Paul could say everything work together for the good to dim to love God a collar cord their purpose how did God got in control if we could only acknowledge that sometimes we go through trials and tribulation we think Oh God why me but God got in control he knew what you were doing this services right here how can you be overcome and you never become none so he did they say give us so Jesus had to be that he had to be that sacrifice and he never now much it knows Jesus only could claim so much of his dominion ship but is he never claimed all his Dominion ship to after he had conquered death gray hail and resurrected you think about that he never de claim all the Dominion shifty them went to all third those those days and once he went through those stages right there how you say Brett Julia cuz he never claimed this board in the scripture so out he conquered death graven hail he rose up and he come out of the gray and then once you come out of the gray he steps up he said oh he then took the minute i abducted me in order I attend dominion over the heavens all power is given unto me and heaven in her ever names that call gonna call on me now I do this narrator I have paid the price of redemption and I have paid your price hey will you breathe the name of Jesus Christ ever Devon Hale gotta buy now all power is given unto me what you can do if you ever get the baptism in the Holy Spirit I leave that out there devil Oh God you said brother Drew that was Jesus no that was Jesus had it now you got it and now you don't have to be Robin it's not robbery to come to the same level favorite Jesus had how do you say brother Joe would he have a vagina David the same level how did Jesus seen you before man even had the whole ego he met a certain soldier he had the same things that he had me the man had the same faith in Jesus area he said another man I'm a man of authority out of all the people that Jesus met in that day he was a jet how a man with the same level of faith that Jesus had explaining to Jesus I understand the law of faith he says I understand what authority is I understand what Dominion CBS so he explained into Jesus the revelation that he had in and he says I say to this man come he come I say to just men go he says no use for you to go to my house I'm not even that but I know if you say the word I know the power behind the word so he understood the power of authority and we speak the name of Jesus Christ in authority he they ever Devon he'll ever need had about heard the name of Jesus Christ he gave us that authority and what we're going to do with it God he created us to look at it he creates the speaking how do you tell your body I'm healed however go to the doctor be go
