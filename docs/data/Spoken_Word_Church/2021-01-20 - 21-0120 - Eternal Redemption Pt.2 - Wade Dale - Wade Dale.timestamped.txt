[0:52] looking on a man would be
[0:58] a tragedy
[1:00] [Music]
[1:04] but what this world could not see
[1:09] [Music]
[1:11] when they nailed him to
[1:14] that tree it would break
[1:19] the chains of sins
[1:22] [Music]
[1:24] captivity
[1:30] love grew
[1:32] [Music]

[1:40] [Music]
[1:52] misery

[2:56] forgiveness growing
[2:58] [Music]
[3:02] free

[6:43] you and say boy that was the best sermon
[6:44] you ever preached and you're like man i

[6:56] made that trip back this way
[6:57] hey man good to have you back and uh
[7:01] in service for the lord but hebrews 9 11
[7:04] we're still on the plan this will be
[7:06] part two
[7:07] remember it's brother tara it's talking
[7:08] about february the sixth you need to be
[7:09] there about four o'clock get your
[7:10] picture took
[7:12] and um make sure you sign up downstairs
[7:15] also before we do that um
[7:19] i'll make two more announcements and
[7:20] then brother joe if you don't mind
[7:21] pulling that up
[7:23] that we were talking about but february
[7:25] the 14th which will be valentine's day
[7:27] i'll be in kentucky june and i will be
[7:29] at brother richard hyatt's we just
[7:30] talked to him on the phone he said tell
[7:32] everybody hello
[7:33] and god bless you but we'll be there on
[7:35] the weekend of
[7:36] valentine's day so and then also june
[7:39] the 17th
[7:40] 18th and 19th will be the father's day
[7:42] fishing trip did y'all notice what color
[7:45] she had on today
[7:50] y'all sit down please tell everybody sit
[7:52] down go brother dale said
[7:54] everybody have a seat you notice that
[7:57] that's purple
[8:00] brother brown said now i predict i saw a
[8:02] great woman stand up beautiful looking
[8:04] dressed in real
[8:05] highly royals like purple
[8:10] why did she wear purple
[8:15] she may not be the one but it's like
[8:18] uh brother joe and i were talking if
[8:20] this is not it it's
[8:22] opened the door for it but there she
[8:25] stands
[8:26] in the prophecy she was standing
[8:29] up the only one without a mask on
[8:34] free to be able to speak i guess you
[8:35] don't have the virus she can't get the
[8:37] virus i guess
[8:38] but there she stands in purple
[8:42] but the reason it's not on here but the
[8:45] reason
[8:45] that that they all were there were
[8:48] several other women wore purple
[8:50] was because of the suffrage movement of
[8:53] the women
[8:54] in the 1900s because they couldn't vote
[8:56] and all the things that brother brown
[8:57] said remember that we
[8:58] uh the things we did wrong by allowing
[9:00] women to vote and all that sorry women
[9:02] that i didn't say that the prophet did
[9:04] just live by it
[9:05] amen because we're all women in the body
[9:07] of christ okay
[9:08] but there you are there she is in purple
[9:11] whether she used to do anything with it
[9:13] or not i don't know do you
[9:15] you don't know maybe brother brown saw
[9:16] that in the vision maybe you saw that
[9:18] very picture
[9:20] of a woman standing up with her hand up
[9:23] and her other hand on the bible
[9:27] and mr well now president biden
[9:31] just today hired a transgender woman to
[9:35] be our health director
[9:38] a transgender woman to be our health
[9:42] director
[9:42] in the united states of america and she
[9:45] you right
[9:46] she's ugly as all get out he is
[9:49] he was a he you see how perverted this
[9:52] thing is
[9:54] we're just about ready to get out of
[9:56] here
[9:57] it's just all pointing i mean we're
[9:59] gonna have to let but you know what's
[10:01] gonna happen we're gonna listen to this
[10:02] transgender woman
[10:04] tell us that it's okay for men to go in
[10:06] women's bathroom and women go in men's
[10:07] bathroom and there's not going to be any
[10:09] gender
[10:10] to our bathrooms anymore
[10:13] we were talking today and you want to
[10:15] stand back up we were talking today at
[10:16] the post office and
[10:18] one of the girls she's kind of a little
[10:20] country girl and she said
[10:22] if some country boy walks in and there's
[10:24] a girl in the bathroom well i don't know
[10:26] what's going to happen
[10:27] especially if it's a transgender woman
[10:30] but this is what the nation's coming to
[10:31] she's going to lead
[10:33] our medical
[10:37] ideals as a transgender person she was a
[10:41] man now she's a woman
[10:43] so if this if god if god don't destroy
[10:47] this country
[10:48] he'll have to raise up sodom and
[10:50] gomorrah and apologize for it
[10:53] so that's what we're coming to though we
[10:55] got everything we need now
[10:57] you say well now what no you know what i
[10:59] believe this happened because something
[11:02] has already started happening
[11:03] in the bride the true bride is going to
[11:07] be and already is on her way out of here
[11:11] amen we listen
[11:14] signs follow the believer
[11:18] that's a sign but it should be something
[11:20] that we don't follow that
[11:22] that follows those two spirits that we
[11:26] now know where
[11:28] listen that's sure that is part of the
[11:30] other spirit
[11:31] but that ain't the spirit i was talking
[11:32] about during the whole time i'm talking
[11:34] about the one that's right here
[11:36] uh that just shows you that though you
[11:38] know half of the world is
[11:40] is rejoicing over it and the other half
[11:43] don't mind and the other half don't care
[11:47] somebody will get that one these days
[11:50] okay but that's what we're coming to
[11:53] men women children
[11:56] just be aware watch what's going on
[12:00] it's going to get worse but we have a
[12:03] hope of eternal redemption
[12:06] we had a prophet come tell us 50
[12:07] something years ago no
[12:09] no longer than that 70 something this
[12:12] was 1930
[12:13] something when she he saw that vision my
[12:15] come on now
[12:17] that's been a long time and and then we
[12:19] see it prophecy being fulfilled as
[12:20] brother dale's talking about
[12:22] we see it right here with our own eyes
[12:25] and you know what we didn't see it as a
[12:26] prophecy
[12:28] we saw it as a reality exactly amen a
[12:31] lot of people
[12:32] saw it as a as as looking at a prophecy
[12:35] but when you're stan when when noah
[12:37] prophesied for 120 years that it was
[12:39] going to rain
[12:41] one day when god shut that door of that
[12:44] ark
[12:45] it rained the fulfillment of that
[12:48] prophecy
[12:49] noah was looking out the window at it so
[12:52] that's what
[12:52] you and i are doing now we're looking
[12:54] now out the window
[12:56] of the mind of god looking through the
[12:58] mind of god the prophet's already been
[12:59] there he was the first one to partake
[13:02] go back into the back part of god's mind
[13:03] but you and i are able to do the same
[13:06] thing
[13:06] and then just instead of say oh me we
[13:09] can say
[13:10] praise the lord right and you know what
[13:13] i didn't need that to tell me the
[13:14] prophet was right though
[13:17] no he's a word prophet the word tells me
[13:19] you read here in revelation 17. you got
[13:21] the woman
[13:21] what she said and she's sitting on what
[13:23] she's a red and purple
[13:25] and scarlet colors decked with gold
[13:27] chapter 17 revel
[13:29] book of revelation so let's see how this
[13:31] ends up but let's talk about the plan of
[13:33] redemption
[13:34] because you know what it's a perfect
[13:35] plan will not fail
[13:37] they talked about plans all day today
[13:39] how bad how everybody was going to do
[13:41] this and not just naming everybody but
[13:42] everybody's going to they got all their
[13:44] plans they will
[13:46] fail that plan will never fail
[13:51] man's changed god's never changed
[13:54] man's wrote different things has changed
[13:56] god's wrote one thing and it never will
[13:58] change
[13:59] so let's put our existence on this right
[14:02] here on the word of god hebrews 9 verse
[14:04] 11
[14:04] let's pray before we before we get
[14:06] started just remember these
[14:07] announcements
[14:11] remember guys june 17th 18th 19th get
[14:14] your time off for you
[14:16] for the father's day fishing trip there
[14:17] in helen we've already got the lodge
[14:19] it is rented already so hebrews 9 verse
[14:22] 11. dear heavenly father
[14:24] thank you lord because many prophets
[14:28] stood and wanted to see this day
[14:32] the fulfillment of all scripture from
[14:34] genesis all the way to revelations and
[14:36] now here we stand
[14:38] and lord we may not know tomorrow but we
[14:41] know who holds tomorrow
[14:44] and that same person's inside of us and
[14:46] i pray lord that you would give us
[14:48] as i pray every day we should always
[14:50] pray for supernatural guidance not just
[14:53] guidance by man not just guidance by
[14:55] parents not just god it's by this or
[14:57] the other but supernatural guidance lord
[15:00] just say the right thing and do the
[15:02] right thing and lord if it's you

[15:08] all of us out of the way tonight you
[15:09] enter in you take over you do the
[15:11] speaking you do the revealing and let us
[15:13] have a good time in you father we pray
[15:15] that you'll just be with the ones that
[15:16] are sick
[15:17] be the ones that are not with us lord
[15:20] ones that we see the virus may be
[15:22] not so much around uh here anymore in
[15:25] different places
[15:26] people getting over it and getting back
[15:27] to church father we pray that you'd
[15:29] protect us now lord
[15:30] put that protection over us father that
[15:32] holy ghost veil that'll keep not only
[15:34] our
[15:35] our soul what was redeemed for eternity
[15:38] but lord
[15:39] help get that outside man ready to go
[15:42] father we ask these things lord in the
[15:44] name of jesus christ
[15:45] amen hebrews 9 11 but christ being
[15:48] coming high priest of good things to
[15:49] come
[15:50] by greater and more perfect tabernacle
[15:53] not made with hands that is to say
[15:55] not of this building now we're going to
[15:58] get into some types and shadows later on
[16:00] as we go into this plan looking at the
[16:03] ten commandments and what happened there
[16:05] the writing on the
[16:06] uh up there mount sinai and all these
[16:08] different things we're gonna break it
[16:10] down last time we just kind of flew
[16:11] through the timeline
[16:13] but we're gonna kind of break it down a
[16:14] little bit for the young ones and for
[16:16] the old ones that's maybe forgot
[16:18] like me neither by the blood of bulls
[16:21] and calves but by his own blood he
[16:23] entered once into the holy place
[16:25] and here's where i got my thought having
[16:26] obtained eternal
[16:28] redemption amen for us amen
[16:32] god bless you and have your seats
[16:35] eternal
[16:35] redemption for us he had to obtain
[16:39] he did not have to obtain eternal
[16:41] redemption in his soul
[16:43] he was the he was the fullness of the
[16:45] godhead body so so he was father son and
[16:48] holy ghost almighty god
[16:50] but his body had to be redeemed his body
[16:53] had to be
[16:54] made eternal all right just like you and
[16:57] i
[16:57] our body has to be made eternal but
[17:00] remember he didn't come
[17:02] by carnal knowledge like me and you
[17:04] that's that's why he could do the things
[17:07] he did
[17:08] i and my father are one i only do that
[17:10] which the father saith
[17:12] you know i in other words like i said
[17:13] before he didn't get up in the morning
[17:16] fighting over the guy inside of him
[17:19] and we do
[17:22] really you don't well pray for me amen
[17:26] but having obtained eternal redemption
[17:28] for us now we we covered i'm going to go
[17:30] through well we got about half
[17:31] of the note so i'm going to cover this
[17:32] real quick if you'll go to number one
[17:34] but while they're pulling number one up
[17:36] if you'll remember we were talking about
[17:40] man and god has made everlasting
[17:43] covenants
[17:44] he made one with a bow or a rainbow he
[17:46] made one with adam if you'll do this
[17:49] i'll do this he made one with different
[17:51] ones down through time but he finally
[17:53] comes to abraham
[17:54] which is the father of our faith and he
[17:56] didn't say abraham now if you'll do this
[17:58] and not give your wife away and if
[18:00] you'll wait till you're 99 years old
[18:02] he never put a condition on that
[18:05] he said i will that's the same way with
[18:08] genesis 3 15 he didn't give that to
[18:10] nobody else but himself one of the
[18:12] greatest scriptures in the bible where
[18:13] god says
[18:14] i'll redeem this thing back i had to let
[18:18] it fall because i put you in flesh i'm a
[18:20] redeemer a savior a healer and all these
[18:22] different attributes
[18:23] that are bottled up inside of me because
[18:25] i'm what i'm infinite god
[18:29] and these things have to come out amen
[18:32] and then what happened and we'll look at
[18:34] it in just a minute we're talking about
[18:35] this book
[18:36] we may cover that a little bit later on
[18:38] down here we're going to read where
[18:40] in continuance in other words there was
[18:43] a book written
[18:44] right there was a book of life and there
[18:46] was the lounge book of life we know that
[18:48] there's different sections of that book
[18:50] one you can be taken out of one you
[18:52] can't be taken out of right amen
[18:55] if you're born again see remember that
[18:57] genesis 1 26 man
[18:59] was written in blood in the lounge book
[19:00] of life and never could be taken out
[19:03] but had to wait till the time for you to
[19:05] get here
[19:06] so that it could land where it's
[19:08] supposed to land because the real true
[19:10] seed
[19:11] is the spoken word but he had to allow
[19:14] your natural seed to get here by mom and
[19:16] daddy and grandma and grandpa grandma
[19:18] and grandpa grandma and grandpa
[19:19] right to get you here to match that part
[19:23] that he saw before
[19:24] the foundation of the world amen now
[19:26] what happened to a lot of us is brother
[19:28] donnie he saw us brother ryan said he
[19:29] took a picture of it
[19:30] at 19 years old we've done flew past
[19:32] that most of us
[19:35] and next tuesday one more year past it
[19:38] for me
[19:39] so joyce won't be an old i'll be an old
[19:41] man she'll be an old woman now she's
[19:42] just
[19:43] way older than i am you were born in the
[19:44] 50s you can't understand that
[19:48] i was born a whole different decade than
[19:49] you were
[19:51] yeah was born in the 19th century jim
[19:54] says
[19:58] 18th for you but
[20:01] god said i will and when god said i will
[20:05] he already had it in here
[20:07] brother brown said what is god's will
[20:10] his will
[20:10] is his word so when he said i will he's
[20:13] writing it down this is his will
[20:16] this is his whole will this is what he
[20:18] wills us
[20:19] to do but he doesn't will us to do it
[20:21] because remember the bible says he would
[20:23] that
[20:23] all be saved see god's not a god
[20:27] yeah he gets angry and he has different
[20:29] emotions because the bible says he has
[20:31] different emotions
[20:32] he even repented that he made man
[20:34] knowing what he would do but
[20:36] being god he had emotion
[20:39] where do you think we get ours ours is
[20:42] just perverted
[20:43] his was not jesus jesus that's why jesus
[20:46] didn't have a problem with the father
[20:48] whatever the father said do that's what
[20:50] he did
[20:50] he never had a carnal mind to look back
[20:53] on and said well i can't do that because
[20:55] my mom or daddy is
[20:57] shy talks too loud you understand what i
[20:59] mean
[21:00] he didn't have that to look back to you
[21:01] know what he looked back to he said
[21:02] before abraham was
[21:04] right i am and then they said thou art
[21:07] the christ in other words they put him
[21:09] all the way back to where we're talking
[21:10] about now back into eternity
[21:13] they just couldn't understand how that
[21:14] man that they saw that would
[21:16] have to eat and maybe got sick and grown
[21:18] with a headache and
[21:20] and was so tired he slipped through a
[21:21] storm
[21:23] could be almighty god but he was
[21:27] see that's the same thing with me and
[21:28] you we look at all of our human
[21:31] inadequacies and we say well
[21:33] we can't be god well now if they said
[21:36] jesus wasn't god they're going to say
[21:38] you're not
[21:38] right just like i said before you know
[21:40] if we've got god in us and the same
[21:42] attributes they're going to treat you
[21:43] the same way they did when he was
[21:45] walking on the face of the earth
[21:46] amen but brother brown said job the
[21:49] oldest book of the bible was supposed to
[21:51] even be written before moses wrote
[21:52] genesis
[21:53] but the oldest book in the bible was
[21:55] speaking of redemption yet redemption
[21:56] was far
[21:58] way before that redemption is one of the
[22:00] oldest things in the bible
[22:02] did you know redemption was even before
[22:04] the plan of redemption was laid out
[22:06] before the world was ever formed
[22:09] it can't lose listen adam couldn't lose
[22:14] he lost one part he had to give
[22:17] that book back the part the eternal part
[22:20] yes that's right hello he had to give
[22:23] that back to god
[22:25] couldn't produce that anymore but
[22:27] remember there was a
[22:29] book of life that was opened and began
[22:31] because when seth was born and when
[22:33] when even when um cain and abel and
[22:36] laban and all these different ones down
[22:38] to time there was a book written
[22:41] and they came by carnal knowledge they
[22:44] came by sex but when god stood there in
[22:46] genesis 3 like brother dale said
[22:47] god didn't curse adam god didn't curse
[22:50] eve he cursed the ground
[22:53] so where did he have to come from
[22:56] he came from the ground
[23:00] took sperm took egg placed it in mary
[23:02] put it in the earth
[23:04] and here comes jesus christ the baby
[23:08] that looked 50 years old but yet he was
[23:09] only 30. what a rough ministry he must
[23:12] have
[23:12] redemption is one of the oldest things
[23:14] in the bible did you know redemption was
[23:15] even the plan of redemption was laid out
[23:17] before the world was ever formed think
[23:20] of that now here we were last sunday
[23:22] god foreseeing boom
[23:26] knowing what we would do knowing what we
[23:28] would do even if we didn't do it
[23:31] that's infinite right that was hard for
[23:34] me to understand brother dale one time
[23:35] we were going somewhere and it was about
[23:37] a two hour trip or maybe going hunting
[23:38] or somewhere
[23:39] and he started laying that out and my
[23:41] mind was going whoa
[23:43] i never thought of it that way but an
[23:45] infinite god knows
[23:46] every way you would have chose if you
[23:49] had not a chose
[23:50] like i said if you had five choices five
[23:53] choices
[23:55] brother harris helped me one time
[23:56] because he he told me he said you know
[23:58] he said god showed me a vision that this
[24:00] person
[24:01] that was i think it was in this church
[24:03] was supposed to marry this other girl
[24:05] but he didn't he married another
[24:07] believer and it was fine it was okay
[24:09] he said but he should have made her
[24:10] because i saw it in the vision
[24:13] i'm like well how in the world but then
[24:16] brother dale comes up and says
[24:17] god knows you if you didn't marry june
[24:19] if you made you find a mad joyce
[24:21] lord oh never mind um
[24:25] but not really he would but think about
[24:28] all those girlfriends that you had that
[24:32] like dad he had a girlfriend there to at
[24:34] home and
[24:36] before his mom and just a dating well
[24:38] that could have been my mama
[24:40] but it couldn't have because it took the
[24:42] two to get together
[24:44] that had me in it that's how god used to
[24:47] now now see i believe in predestination
[24:49] that way
[24:51] you're predetermined to get here but
[24:53] it's because of what god foresaw before
[24:55] the foundation of the world
[24:57] that that genesis 1 26 man was developed
[25:00] in the mind of god
[25:01] and this is what donnie fall bush is
[25:02] going to look like and this is what luis
[25:04] youregos will look like
[25:05] and their tendencies and characteristics
[25:14] and god liked it so much he sent a
[25:17] prophet here to say and god bred this
[25:19] one to this one
[25:20] this one to this one this one to this
[25:22] one to get you here
[25:24] so that that would match wow
[25:30] see when we lay a plan out we have to
[25:32] change it
[25:34] but when god lays a plan out he's
[25:37] already saw the end of it
[25:40] so it cannot it cannot fail
[25:44] now i'll go with you if you go to that i
[25:46] always was eternal and i'm this
[25:48] eternal being amen but that's in the
[25:50] mind of god
[25:53] he holds that only and it took a profit
[25:55] to bring it to us
[25:57] though but now in that interpretation
[26:01] i don't know why i'm doing this but it
[26:03] there but with that interpretation
[26:05] people in the message they pervert it
[26:08] and say oh you always was eternal you
[26:10] you always come here you had eternal
[26:11] life already in your soul when you were
[26:13] born a baby
[26:14] because god saw you brother brown tells
[26:16] you we were if you weren't there you
[26:18] never will be there
[26:19] it's not you right the real you
[26:24] the one you've never seen before that
[26:26] god
[26:27] stood back whatever he was standing on
[26:31] and said let us make man in our own
[26:36] image
[26:38] there was an image that god projected in
[26:41] his mind
[26:43] and it wasn't of adolf hitler or your
[26:46] neighbor
[26:46] or anybody without the new birth they
[26:49] came because of permissive will
[26:51] they came just to fill this earth up to
[26:54] be your tormentor
[26:56] or whatever you say but only god only in
[27:00] his
[27:00] lamb's book of life he's only got a
[27:02] certain group of people written down
[27:06] and that group of people is the only one
[27:08] that's going to fulfill that genesis 1
[27:10] 26
[27:11] it'll be the bride of jesus christ
[27:15] that's why i said before if you can't
[27:17] read
[27:18] we couldn't read revelations i told you
[27:21] the other day i'm going to go
[27:22] talk to a baptist guy i don't even know
[27:24] him but he's got one of the biggest
[27:26] churches there in guiltful
[27:27] goes with baptists and he seems like to
[27:29] be a real nice guy and i'm just going to
[27:30] sit down and say look man
[27:33] tell me about predestination by the
[27:35] baptist not by your view
[27:37] because you went to seminary i know he
[27:38] did i said tell me what
[27:41] predestination is by the baptist
[27:42] doctrine i don't i'm not going to fight
[27:44] with you
[27:45] i'm just going to write it down i'm
[27:47] doing research
[27:48] amen and i want to find out exactly
[27:51] because you know we say
[27:53] that they say this and we know that
[27:55] there's been certain times they've said
[27:56] this
[27:57] but i want to really know because i want
[28:00] to know where they got off at
[28:03] we know it was nicea but that came from
[28:05] catholic church but it evolved into a
[28:07] baptist doctrine it evolved into a
[28:08] presbyterian doctrine
[28:10] it evolved into a methodist doctrine it
[28:12] evolved into a
[28:13] pentecostal doctrine and then the
[28:14] pentecostals we got to church of god and
[28:17] no music speaking in tongues no speaking
[28:20] in tongues one god
[28:22] jesus only you see what i mean it got
[28:25] perverted somewhere as it went forward
[28:28] but when god said let us make man in our
[28:30] own image
[28:31] folks that person he made not created
[28:34] but brought into being yeah
[28:38] was perfect never had a bad thought
[28:43] never drank a beer never lusted
[28:47] you see what comes to you at your new
[28:48] birth
[28:50] but you got to let that thing live you
[28:53] got to let that thing out
[28:55] amen let it out and let it work
[28:58] because you still got that spirit realm
[29:00] of memory reasoning
[29:02] conscious affection and the devil just
[29:05] stays right there and plays all day
[29:07] amen but listen god knew that
[29:11] he gave you something he gave you a
[29:14] shield a helmet
[29:16] a sword
[29:21] you got it already when you get the new
[29:24] birth property i said you got
[29:25] all everything you need for your journey
[29:27] glory but what our problem is though is
[29:29] we don't listen to it a lot
[29:33] god foreseeing and making a way of
[29:35] redemption before he
[29:37] even made the world right for the bible
[29:40] plainly says that christ was
[29:41] predestinated for ordained and was the
[29:43] lamb of god
[29:45] slain before the foundation of the world
[29:46] that's right way before the world was
[29:48] made god had a plan
[29:50] of redemption everybody say amen buddy
[29:53] that's a good one
[29:54] first corinthians 2 verse 6. now watch
[29:56] how be it we speak
[29:58] wisdom among them that are perfect yet
[30:00] not the wisdom of this world nor of the
[30:02] princes of this world that come to
[30:03] naught
[30:04] but we speak the wisdom of god in a
[30:06] mystery
[30:07] even the hidden wisdom which god
[30:10] ordained
[30:11] before the world unto our glory
[30:16] listen god knows who he is
[30:20] he loves to be worshipped but he loves
[30:24] fellowship
[30:25] glory he doesn't want to beat you and
[30:27] make you worship him
[30:29] no that's not a true ruler the glory he
[30:33] gets is
[30:34] us the glory he gets is
[30:37] seeing that genesis 1 26 man come into
[30:40] shape and fruition and grow up into a
[30:42] what adoption grows up into god wants us
[30:46] to speak folks
[30:47] him speak through us everybody got there
[30:53] didn't brother bryan say one time god's
[30:55] not complete without
[30:57] you amen you know what
[31:01] he wanted it that way i'm just dumb
[31:04] enough to believe it
[31:05] that's the way he wanted it he wanted us
[31:07] and all of our inadequacies and all the
[31:08] different things he wanted me and you
[31:10] to share his glory and man he wanted
[31:13] that
[31:14] and that was his whole desire and part
[31:17] of the plan
[31:20] knowing we would fall knowing we would
[31:22] come and lay out a sea
[31:23] and see a woman stand up and get sworn
[31:26] in as vice president
[31:27] he saw this but he put us here for a
[31:30] purpose
[31:36] titus 1 verse 1
[31:41] in hope of eternal life which god that
[31:43] cannot lie
[31:45] promised before the world began but hath
[31:47] in due times manifested his word what
[31:49] through preaching
[31:52] now we can get a lot listen you can get
[31:55] a lot at home
[31:57] you can get a lot press and play but you
[32:00] can't get perfected by that
[32:03] right um bible says he gave some
[32:06] apostles prophets pastors teachers and
[32:08] evangelists
[32:09] not to make you born again but to
[32:11] perfect you
[32:14] through preaching which paul didn't have
[32:17] a problem
[32:18] telling them where it came from
[32:21] which is committed unto me according to
[32:24] the commandment of god our savior in
[32:25] other words he stood up one day and he
[32:26] said
[32:27] you'll be judged by what i say that's
[32:29] right
[32:30] if an angel from heaven come and preach
[32:32] you anything that you that you've not
[32:33] heard me preach
[32:34] let him be a curse an angel
[32:42] that scripture keeps going through my
[32:43] mind brother luis come boldly to the
[32:45] throne of grace
[32:47] not stupidly not stupidly but boldly
[32:52] but now remember let me tell you what
[32:53] would what what would look stupid
[32:56] what would look stupid to the world to a
[32:58] bystander
[33:00] to some news agency
[33:03] is when here's goliath
[33:06] all about 14 i mean he's this guy is
[33:11] two times taller than david
[33:14] and here's the news agency pointing at
[33:16] him and over here at the camp of israel
[33:19] and here's saul and they're like well
[33:20] maybe saul he's a you know he was head
[33:22] and shoulders he freaking signed
[33:24] had all the armor he had fought many
[33:27] battles
[33:30] and then all of a sudden out of all that
[33:34] walks this little guy by that thaw
[33:37] with nothing but a belt
[33:41] a piece of leather on and a little bag
[33:45] and a sling in his hand and all that
[33:48] armor glittering in the background
[33:51] all this armor glittering in the
[33:52] background and there's this big giant
[33:54] he's got this great big
[33:55] sword i mean great big staff
[33:59] to the world david looks stupid
[34:03] but to god that was exactly what he
[34:05] wanted david to do
[34:07] david didn't look at the news agency
[34:09] david didn't look over there and wonder
[34:10] and david
[34:11] i don't believe david even looked behind
[34:12] him to see if anybody was following him
[34:14] because he knew what he was going to do
[34:17] he said today i'll take your head off
[34:20] right he said you have defied my god
[34:25] when are we going to stand up and say
[34:27] the same thing look stupid of the world
[34:28] that's fine with me but when we're going
[34:29] to stand up
[34:30] and somebody say something about you
[34:32] sister say something about your clothing
[34:33] hair a man
[34:34] say look we're bible believers right
[34:38] we believe what the bible says i'm not
[34:42] worried about what you're saying what
[34:43] you think of me
[34:45] or what the world thinks about us
[34:50] are you ashamed jesus said if you're
[34:53] ashamed of me he said i'll be ashamed of
[34:54] you
[34:55] he said if you'll stand up for me he
[34:57] said i'll stand up for you
[35:01] ephesians 1 verse 1.
[35:04] to me like i said this is the whole plan
[35:06] of redemption
[35:08] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[35:09] will of god
[35:11] to the saints which are ephesus so
[35:12] that's me in you and to the faithful in
[35:15] christ jesus grace be to you and peace
[35:16] from our
[35:17] god our father and from the lord jesus
[35:19] christ blessed be the god and father of
[35:21] our lord jesus christ who has blessed us
[35:23] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[35:25] places
[35:26] in christ look according as he has
[35:28] chosen uh where in him
[35:33] many are called few are chosen
[35:37] according us he has chosen us not by him
[35:40] now there's been a lot of people chosen
[35:42] by god to do certain things
[35:44] pharaoh was chosen by god to do certain
[35:46] things hitler was
[35:47] chosen by god to do certain things all
[35:49] these different place
[35:50] people were chosen by god to do
[35:52] different things right
[35:53] but now they weren't chosen in christ
[35:55] and act the way they do
[35:57] if you're chosen in him then whatever
[36:00] he's got
[36:02] and remember he had the whole plan
[36:05] father-son
[36:06] the whole plan of redemption is actually
[36:08] in those three offices
[36:11] father son holy spirit
[36:15] whole plan of redemption is in those
[36:17] three things right there amen
[36:18] according to chosen us in him when
[36:20] before the foundational world
[36:22] oh boy like brother dale said they just
[36:24] go oh boy i feel i was back
[36:26] listen you were nothing forget that
[36:28] business
[36:31] but you know what somebody must have
[36:33] read that though dad somebody must have
[36:34] read that though
[36:35] and said well we were back there as
[36:37] people because see the mormons get the
[36:38] same they got a doctrine that we were
[36:40] all back there
[36:42] so we were chosen in him before the
[36:44] foundation of the world so we must have
[36:46] been back there
[36:47] no prophet god said you were nothing
[36:49] right
[36:50] the only thing jesus christ the
[36:51] difference in you and me is we can't
[36:53] remember back there
[36:55] he stood one day and said i and my
[36:57] father one father
[36:58] let us have the same fellowship as we
[37:01] did before why because he was eternal
[37:04] right he was the eternal god
[37:09] and he said before abraham was i am you
[37:11] know he was the one that talked to
[37:13] abraham
[37:16] unless you got three or four gods he
[37:19] stood in the bush
[37:21] talked to abraham picked him up some
[37:24] dust
[37:25] fed him uh communion as melchizedek
[37:28] and then met him a few years later as
[37:30] melchizedek
[37:32] and abraham did have no problem saying
[37:34] my lord that's right
[37:38] who in the world can stand there and say
[37:40] abraham i'll visit you
[37:42] right you're gonna have that baby
[37:46] and sarah's gonna be the one to have it
[37:49] it had to be almighty god
[37:52] what fulfilling his plan
[37:55] that we should be holding without blame
[37:57] before him in love
[37:58] having predestinated us unto the
[38:01] adoption of children by jesus christ
[38:03] to himself according to the good
[38:05] pleasure of his will to the praise of
[38:07] the glory of his grace
[38:09] when he hath made us accepted
[38:12] in the beloved amen all right so we're
[38:14] accepted in christ right
[38:16] this is really elementary but this is
[38:17] how it all got started
[38:20] christ got accepted by dying on the
[38:21] cross in the mind of god before the
[38:23] foundation of the world
[38:24] now where were we where were we
[38:28] we were in him not as people
[38:32] but as that genesis 1 26 that germ
[38:35] of life eternal life
[38:39] because remember he started plasm he
[38:42] started passing that out
[38:44] to adam right
[38:47] and he became an eternal person eternal
[38:50] soul
[38:51] oh my but when the fall happened
[38:55] god couldn't do that anymore right he
[38:58] forfeited god had to take the
[39:00] take the book back we'll get into it
[39:01] this time but it did not stop the plan
[39:04] of god
[39:04] nothing will stop the plan of god you
[39:07] can't stop it
[39:08] go out there and go out there and have a
[39:10] prayer meeting all night
[39:12] that the sun won't come up tomorrow
[39:15] ain't it happening because god said it's
[39:16] going to come up
[39:17] amen in whom we have redemption through
[39:21] his blood the forgiveness of sins
[39:22] according to the riches of his grace
[39:24] wherein he has abounded toward us in all
[39:26] wisdom and prudence look having made
[39:28] known unto us
[39:29] the mystery of the of his will us
[39:33] the mystery of his will according to his
[39:35] good pleasure which he has purposed in
[39:36] himself
[39:37] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[39:39] of times in other words this right now
[39:41] this 2000 last 2000 years
[39:43] he might gather together in one all
[39:45] things in christ
[39:47] both which are in heaven and which are
[39:49] on earth even in him
[39:51] and look in whom also we have obtained
[39:54] an inheritance remember i told you last
[39:56] sunday
[39:57] jesus didn't come to bring you your
[39:58] inheritance
[40:01] your inheritance was before the
[40:02] foundation of the world he just came and
[40:04] made a way for you to get back to it
[40:06] amen that doesn't do away with jesus
[40:09] christ
[40:10] he's the very key to this thing
[40:13] don't ever forget that if he hadn't went
[40:16] to calvary you and i wouldn't have been
[40:17] released
[40:18] right also we have obtained an
[40:20] inheritance being what predestinated
[40:22] there's not a problem with that but
[40:24] brother rama always said he said be
[40:25] careful with that word you know why
[40:26] because that word is predestined
[40:30] predetermined destiny now if you do that
[40:33] and take it the way a lot of people take
[40:34] it on this one side
[40:35] you don't have a choice
[40:38] you get on this other side over here and
[40:40] it's just it's just greasy grace
[40:42] no you got a choice if cain
[40:46] had a choice you had a choice
[40:49] because he was to me the worst of the
[40:51] worst
[40:53] being that he killed his own brother but
[40:55] bringing being predestinated what
[40:57] according to the purpose i'm not going
[41:00] to add to this but listen
[41:01] according to the purpose of him that saw
[41:03] all things
[41:07] from the beginning to the end that saw
[41:08] all things because look who worketh all
[41:11] things after the council of his own will
[41:12] he
[41:12] in his mind he saw these things happen
[41:15] and he said
[41:16] this is the way i want it i've said
[41:19] before we
[41:20] question we have questions i want
[41:22] everybody to hold a hand up already
[41:23] right now raise your hand
[41:24] up you have questioned god
[41:28] that's the only way he could bring it we
[41:31] questioned that he came to rahab we
[41:33] questioned that he came to the woman at
[41:34] the well we question these things
[41:36] and don't think that it works good in
[41:38] the plan but it's not it's the very plan
[41:40] of god and it's the only way that it'll
[41:42] work
[41:44] see that's why that's why john said if
[41:47] you add a word or jesus said to john
[41:49] on the isle of patmos he said if anybody
[41:51] adds a word to what you're writing down
[41:53] let him be a curse if anybody don't do
[41:55] what says in this book
[41:57] i'm taking the name out of the bible out
[41:58] of the book of life
[42:00] how serious is that right all right
[42:03] revelations 13 8 all that dwell on the
[42:05] earth
[42:07] shall worship him whose names are not
[42:08] written in the book of the life of the
[42:10] lamb slain
[42:12] from the foundation of the world we'll
[42:15] get into this
[42:16] a long time from now but remember when
[42:17] the bible tells us
[42:19] that the books were open you and i are
[42:22] not
[42:23] in that book
[42:26] that's the book of life right we're
[42:28] standing in
[42:29] our book's already been open it's open
[42:31] down here
[42:33] you are the book the bible says what
[42:36] living epistles known and read of all
[42:40] men
[42:40] right we've already been judged by
[42:44] the judge himself
[42:49] and we were written right here but every
[42:52] other person that dwells on this earth
[42:55] will
[42:56] be deceived except those people right
[42:59] there
[43:01] amen
[43:09] number two christ mystery guard reveal
[43:14] excuse me he has showed or revealed it
[43:15] and every type that's in the bible
[43:20] now i said something the other day and
[43:21] it kind of
[43:24] you don't have to have a lot of
[43:25] discernment when you see people's faces
[43:27] especially now that i can just see your
[43:28] eyes
[43:29] instead everybody going you know your
[43:32] eyes
[43:33] tell what's going on so your eyes are
[43:35] the gateway to your soul right
[43:38] so anyway but when i said that uh
[43:43] that the bride doesn't type anything the
[43:44] bride doesn't
[43:48] if you type christ you're a second
[43:49] person
[43:52] i thought we were christ made manifest
[43:55] in another form called the bride
[43:58] i thought all that in the bible
[44:01] was pointing to this day i thought all
[44:04] that was typing
[44:05] and hinged on a bride being on the earth
[44:10] not a second person what is a type a
[44:13] type is
[44:14] abraham typing christ right here abraham
[44:18] typing christ
[44:19] this is not christ this is abraham
[44:22] that's right
[44:23] but when you and i get born again this
[44:25] is the christ
[44:28] there's no separation
[44:32] so believe me when i tell you this whole
[44:35] bible is hinged on having a bride of
[44:37] jesus christ
[44:38] that's not a second person
[44:42] listen satan can type christ
[44:48] boy that made some of his eyeballs go
[44:50] back in your head
[44:51] didn't know what the bible says and
[44:53] brother didn't brother ram say he could
[44:54] make what
[44:55] he could bring every supernatural thing
[44:58] that god could bring except creation
[45:02] there's those two spirits folks that can
[45:05] make it so close
[45:07] listen he's going to deceive everybody
[45:09] in the world thinking they're going to
[45:11] think that god almighty has come down in
[45:13] a pope
[45:15] incarnated the pope and he's going to
[45:17] save this whole world right
[45:20] or are they going to be fooled we're
[45:22] going to be gone though
[45:26] but everybody in the bible somewhere
[45:28] down the line is typing me and you
[45:30] didn't they top christ they type christ
[45:34] now remember christ was back there but
[45:36] these people typed them because that
[45:38] christ was not in these people in the
[45:39] old testament
[45:40] everybody understand that i want us to
[45:42] understand that
[45:44] there's no way when adam did what he did
[45:47] it closed up the natural womb and the
[45:50] spiritual womb of eve so she could not
[45:51] produce the genesis 1 26 man
[45:54] which was the soul of god into the soul
[45:56] of man that's what happened with abraham
[45:58] with
[45:58] sorry adam right right
[46:03] especially into adam he placed eternal
[46:06] life in his soul
[46:07] man and he became an eternal person
[46:11] eve too but nobody after that right
[46:14] that's right
[46:15] because god i say god was gonna take
[46:19] this
[46:20] uh eternal life adam eternal life eve
[46:23] and guess who was gonna come out not
[46:26] dead people
[46:26] that's right they couldn't produce dead
[46:29] people
[46:31] but satan knew if he could get eve to do
[46:33] what he did what she did
[46:35] and produce naturally there's no way god
[46:38] could touch that
[46:39] it was polluted god said i can't touch
[46:41] that no more
[46:43] there'll be an enmity a division between
[46:45] me and you i
[46:46] i can't come into your heart anymore
[46:50] but i'll come back what a plan
[46:55] i'll come i'll put in my ten i'll be the
[46:57] one
[46:58] that comes down and you may bruise my
[47:00] heel and put me on a cross
[47:02] but i'll cut your stinking head off
[47:06] when he went to calvary he stripped
[47:07] satan of every power he thought he ever
[47:09] had
[47:12] telling you folks we can think all
[47:13] mysteries and god you know even paul
[47:14] said
[47:15] we can know all mysteries and not have
[47:17] charity this is chair
[47:18] this is love i'm preaching to you love
[47:20] the love of god
[47:22] that that god almighty in the in before
[47:25] the beginning of time
[47:26] saw all this got it all set up
[47:30] and listen but listen it's not like
[47:32] we're going through the motions like
[47:33] this though
[47:34] oh no no no every day you get up you've
[47:36] got a choice to do something
[47:38] or not do something so when i say you're
[47:41] not
[47:41] and that doesn't belittle you to say
[47:44] that you're not
[47:45] that you're not a type if you're a tight
[47:48] look
[47:48] again here's abraham here's christ
[47:53] let's take a different one here's moses
[47:55] all right here's moses
[47:56] when he was they had to veil his face
[47:58] because christ would come down and
[48:00] anoint moses
[48:01] right but now what do you have to do
[48:05] he had to come off of him right and go
[48:08] back into the holy of holies
[48:09] right right and bulls and goats covered
[48:14] moses his sin and the high priest
[48:17] covered
[48:17] their sin didn't do away with them all
[48:20] right
[48:21] because god couldn't get into their soul
[48:25] because he took that book back and
[48:28] remember brother brown said he was the
[48:30] owner of the book
[48:32] now revelations 5 what happens
[48:35] christ the lamb takes the book
[48:40] from the owner
[48:43] opens it and reveals it brother brown
[48:46] says the most sublime scripture in the
[48:48] bible
[48:49] why because john knew that if somebody
[48:51] didn't come on the scene he was
[48:52] he was as dead as the rest of them but
[48:55] when he saw that lamb
[48:57] there it is the full plan of redemption
[49:00] opened up
[49:02] so adam i mean abraham could type christ
[49:06] moses could be so close till they had to
[49:09] veil his face because of the
[49:11] because of the anointing and the glory
[49:13] on him but when it would go off of him
[49:15] um
[49:16] who was it willie if someone was
[49:17] preaching or maybe brother bob he was
[49:19] moses again
[49:21] well now listen folks when you get born
[49:23] again
[49:26] your old u's dead better be that's our
[49:29] problem we let him live
[49:31] but if that old you is dead christ comes
[49:34] in
[49:34] and then you're not a type right that's
[49:37] right
[49:38] got it moses is the type of christ
[49:41] but he can never be christ manifested in
[49:43] another form called the bride
[49:46] only me and you
[49:49] by the revelation of the opening of the
[49:51] word
[49:53] we see that calvary
[49:56] wiped it all away
[49:59] but the blood of bulls and ghosts
[50:01] couldn't come back and go into
[50:03] moses couldn't go into you'd think moses
[50:06] now buddy he's a great guy
[50:08] he stood in he stood in the gap right he
[50:10] stood as christ
[50:12] but see there's your type we're not as
[50:14] christ
[50:16] i was thinking about that this morning
[50:18] or yesterday morning we're not as
[50:20] anybody
[50:21] satan is as christ right you and i are
[50:25] christ
[50:27] i didn't say that god did
[50:30] saint john 17 jesus said lord i pray
[50:33] that they're one like me and you're one
[50:34] well how are they one
[50:43] he has showed a reveal to every type
[50:44] that's in the bible
[50:46] therefore the entire bible is revelation
[50:48] of god's mystery where in christ
[50:50] the entire bible is an expression of one
[50:52] goal that god had
[50:54] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[50:57] entire bible
[51:00] now look all the
[51:03] acts of acts of the believers in the
[51:06] bible has been in type
[51:09] and expressing what god's great goal is
[51:11] because remember
[51:12] moses was a peace you can't do away with
[51:15] moses
[51:16] you can't do away with isaiah you can't
[51:18] do away with ezekiel you can't do away
[51:20] with elijah you can't do away with
[51:22] john the baptist but they were types
[51:28] they were not the bride of jesus christ
[51:34] but when we come down right here and
[51:36] expressing what god's great goal is and
[51:38] now look and now in this last day
[51:40] he has revealed it and shows it
[51:44] and god's help you'll see it right here
[51:45] this morning what the lord has had in
[51:47] his mind all along
[51:48] and has expressed it to me that's just
[51:50] like the apostle paul standing up and
[51:52] saying if you don't believe what i said
[51:54] that's the same thing right there he's
[51:56] fixing to tell you that morning
[51:57] in christ the mystery of god revealed
[51:59] he's fixing to tell you what god's plan
[52:01] is and what part you are
[52:02] to play in it that's just one quote and
[52:06] there's many many more
[52:07] so we went to the greek lex economy we
[52:09] saw that christ
[52:11] was to anoint and watch how we we talked
[52:13] about furnished him with the necessary
[52:15] powers for
[52:16] its administration and doing christians
[52:18] with the gifts of the holy spirit
[52:20] we showed last sunday this is where we
[52:22] stopped adam remember adam
[52:24] abraham moses joshua david elijah all
[52:26] different ones had pieces of it
[52:28] now remember though the bible tells us
[52:30] that this man right here was the son of
[52:32] god
[52:34] why because he had eternal life in his
[52:37] soul
[52:39] abraham's not called abraham's called a
[52:42] friend of god
[52:44] moses was a great prophet joshua typed
[52:47] christ
[52:50] david typed christ but not to the degree
[52:53] that he typed him like me and you
[52:54] like i mean come on he get he
[52:58] had his best friend
[53:02] killed on purpose just so he could get
[53:06] his wife
[53:07] that don't type christ why because the
[53:10] anointing was off of him
[53:12] and he was david the unregenerated man
[53:15] that okay i'm not belittling any of them
[53:18] but you know what when we meet them
[53:19] they're going to say
[53:21] i knew i messed up
[53:24] but i couldn't do anything about it i
[53:25] had nothing inside of me to stop
[53:28] right elijah
[53:32] all the different ones in other words
[53:34] they had their flaws and they had their
[53:35] things but you know what they type
[53:37] can you not see brother dale's preaching
[53:40] that
[53:40] adam adam is showing
[53:44] us we have a human body we have eternal
[53:47] life in our soul
[53:49] we can't get it we can't get the new
[53:50] birth as a baby
[53:52] so we have to be a little bit older
[53:54] right
[53:56] abraham father he just believed
[54:00] he believed without the new birth man
[54:02] you're supposed to believe because we
[54:03] got the believer inside of us
[54:06] okay moses same way you look at all
[54:08] these different ones they're pieces to
[54:10] the puzzle
[54:12] but they're not this body that he needs
[54:18] to complete itself right
[54:22] and not belittling them at all none zero
[54:25] but that's the way god's plan was he
[54:27] said i'm gonna come back and do it
[54:29] myself
[54:29] but when i come back and do it i'm not
[54:32] just gonna go away
[54:34] i'm gonna come back because i'm not
[54:37] finished brother brown said
[54:38] jesus's part was not finished at calvary
[54:42] sure he said it's finished what the
[54:44] party needed to play
[54:45] right but he wasn't finished
[54:49] wow no he just got started
[54:53] what on earth it got started on earth
[54:57] christ came back to earth and endued
[55:00] christians with gifts
[55:02] of the holy spirit not that they would
[55:04] just now sure there's anointings
[55:07] this anointing is the least singing
[55:08] there's anointings to play the piano
[55:09] there's no
[55:10] learning to play the banjo guitar that's
[55:13] anointing listen and i'm not
[55:15] don't get me wrong that's an anointing
[55:16] that anybody can have
[55:18] gifts and callings are without
[55:19] repentance god can
[55:22] you listen how do you think these people
[55:25] i was looking
[55:28] delivering mail you see a lot of mail
[55:29] pieces but
[55:31] this guy i don't know what his name is
[55:33] but he's got this ministry that's just
[55:35] out of this world
[55:36] and he looks kind of about the same way
[55:39] he looks kind of an oriental guy but
[55:42] he's got
[55:43] pamphlets even in a little town called
[55:45] guildford he's a young guy and his
[55:47] hair's all swooped
[55:48] up like this and done up like this and
[55:50] they're following him like mad
[55:53] what does he say he got a message ain't
[55:55] nobody got a message but you and i
[55:58] sure they got a message to the world but
[56:01] not to get out of here
[56:03] amen not to finish the body that god
[56:05] started
[56:07] they got messed up in other words what
[56:08] happened their wound got polluted like
[56:10] eve's wound got polluted so god can't
[56:12] come through that anymore
[56:14] boy listen if this don't make you happy
[56:17] that god chose you
[56:18] amen in this hour this day
[56:22] he chose you to be here right
[56:26] not just be in this church but be in
[56:27] this great message of the hour
[56:32] [Applause]
[56:38] all right let's go read number three we
[56:40] read it at the end of the service
[56:42] now watch
[56:46] now god's secret mystery he had before
[56:48] the world begun
[56:50] now back in the back part of god's mind
[56:52] there was something that he was trying
[56:54] and going to achieve and he had watch
[56:58] he had a motive in doing it
[57:02] in order to let himself be expressed
[57:05] that's his motivator
[57:08] that's why listen if we're not perverted
[57:10] listen to me if we're not perverted
[57:12] a woman a girl plays with a doll
[57:16] because she's got that motherly instinct
[57:18] in her
[57:19] and that's a trait that she needs to
[57:21] express because she's supposed to be a
[57:23] mother
[57:24] the boys are playing with the tonka toys
[57:26] and they're building stuff with hammers
[57:27] and they're beating the walls up and all
[57:29] these different things why because
[57:30] that's the attributes
[57:31] if you don't like i said if you don't
[57:32] get them crossed like you got them in
[57:34] the end time
[57:35] but that same way with god he had these
[57:37] attributes to be expressed
[57:40] but he couldn't express them fully
[57:45] in the old testament he couldn't express
[57:47] him fully
[57:48] in part of the church ages because he
[57:51] can't work in folks doctrine
[57:53] god cannot and will not work in false
[57:55] doctrine he can allow it
[57:57] but he can't work in it like he wants to
[57:58] work in it right
[58:00] that's why god had to send us a prophet
[58:02] that's why god had to fully
[58:03] had to bring this man that could look
[58:05] back in the back part of god's mind
[58:08] that's a place most people don't get to
[58:10] go
[58:12] but according to brother branham he went
[58:14] back there
[58:16] and gave you the key to get back there
[58:17] yourself
[58:19] oh no bro wait he took it with him he
[58:20] knew so much
[58:23] listen uh
[58:27] no he brought us
[58:32] he didn't bring us the book book was
[58:35] already here
[58:36] right he brought us the ability to look
[58:38] in all pages of the book
[58:42] how in the world would you talk to a
[58:44] denominational person about abraham and
[58:46] sarah being turned back to young men and
[58:48] women
[58:50] but brother brown explains it so well
[58:53] until you have to look like
[58:54] hater wright said ain't nothing but true
[58:57] right
[58:59] married old grant somebody's wanting a
[59:00] king that could have any woman he wanted
[59:02] to and here they are
[59:03] a 300 mile journey down to guerrero and
[59:05] she's supposed to be like 90 something
[59:07] years old and
[59:07] and the kings just said bring her into
[59:10] my
[59:11] into my court right she was changed back
[59:14] to a young woman
[59:16] but god said hey uh-uh see how god
[59:20] protects things
[59:21] because sarah was going to have isaac
[59:23] through abraham not through that
[59:25] stinking king
[59:26] but he told that king he said if you
[59:28] touch her you're a dead man
[59:31] he said oh you know what you're done he
[59:33] well he said
[59:34] that man's my prophet that lied to you
[59:36] you need to go ask him to pray for you
[59:38] and open up the womb of the people in
[59:40] your kingdom or your dead kingdom
[59:42] and i'm sure a bimbling was like i can
[59:45] do anything he's when it lied to me
[59:48] but yet god had an order abraham was
[59:51] this man of the hour
[59:54] because first there wasn't even a moon
[59:55] star at a molecule or anything he was
[59:57] god but he exactly wasn't god at that
[59:59] time because god is an object of worship
[1:00:01] there wasn't nothing to worship him
[1:00:03] so in his great mind he wanted these
[1:00:04] attributes to be expressed
[1:00:07] and him was love and him was to be
[1:00:10] father and him wants to be
[1:00:11] son and he wants to be a savior and him
[1:00:13] was to be a healer
[1:00:14] and all these great attributes that we
[1:00:16] see already expressed
[1:00:18] they were in god see we see him
[1:00:19] expressed so my opinion the first thing
[1:00:22] he made was angels and then they
[1:00:23] worshiped him and that made him god
[1:00:25] he started from there and in previous
[1:00:27] messages i've tried to explain it and
[1:00:28] break it down
[1:00:30] now then when angels began to worship
[1:00:31] him that was before there was even a
[1:00:33] molecule on earth remember
[1:00:34] back when we were talking about the two
[1:00:35] spirits he created lucifer first
[1:00:38] then he created the angels and then
[1:00:40] satan
[1:00:41] produced a product and half of them took
[1:00:43] it or two-thirds of them took it and the
[1:00:44] other ones didn't we'll talk to about it
[1:00:46] just a minute
[1:00:46] all right and that's the influence
[1:00:49] that's down here on the earth now
[1:00:50] but remember satan didn't give his
[1:00:52] influence to eve
[1:00:55] through another person he came himself
[1:00:59] he's the real pro he's the original
[1:01:01] perverter and he was going to do this
[1:01:03] all by himself
[1:01:04] he wasn't going to trust it to no second
[1:01:06] person guy angel no he come himself
[1:01:08] just like christ wasn't going to let
[1:01:10] anybody else come down here and die he
[1:01:11] was going to do it himself
[1:01:12] right i tried to explain it break it
[1:01:15] down and now then when angels began to
[1:01:16] worship him
[1:01:17] that was before even a molecule on the
[1:01:19] earth there was nothing
[1:01:20] it was all darkness there wasn't no sun
[1:01:22] moon stars nothing then he was
[1:01:24] god as he asked job where was you when i
[1:01:26] laid the foundation of the world
[1:01:29] see when the morning started saying
[1:01:30] together and the sons of god shouted for
[1:01:31] joy see now where were you
[1:01:33] see that was way back before the earth
[1:01:34] now god had a purpose and a hidden
[1:01:36] mystery
[1:01:37] and that's what i want to speak on the
[1:01:39] church to own to the church this morning
[1:01:46] this afternoon
[1:01:50] thank you the hidden mystery of god that
[1:01:52] it had in his mind before the world ever
[1:01:54] began so look
[1:01:55] there was a hidden mystery there was a
[1:01:58] prophet of god standing on earth
[1:01:59] saying i'm fixing to tell you what that
[1:02:01] mystery is
[1:02:03] wow i don't see how the you know i was
[1:02:06] thinking today
[1:02:07] all these people that are denying that
[1:02:09] brother branham was whatever what what
[1:02:10] he was
[1:02:12] saying he was wrong of this and that and
[1:02:13] the other but you know what
[1:02:16] i bet you some of them people don't turn
[1:02:17] around and
[1:02:19] that are still preaching whatever they
[1:02:21] preach i don't but i bet you they're not
[1:02:23] how can they go back and preach the
[1:02:24] father son holy ghost baptism
[1:02:27] when the truth's been told them right
[1:02:28] there in the bible i'm talking about all
[1:02:30] these truths i ain't talking about going
[1:02:33] i ain't talking about fishing on the
[1:02:35] wrong day i ain't talking about a cloud
[1:02:36] being over yondering over here i'm
[1:02:37] talking about
[1:02:38] doctrine that was straightened out
[1:02:41] by this prophet in the end time
[1:02:43] regardless of what he turned out to be i
[1:02:45] don't care what they think he was he was
[1:02:46] the prophet of god
[1:02:48] glory and he was a word prophet
[1:02:52] he brought us a hidden mystery
[1:02:55] that god had in his mind before the
[1:02:56] world ever begun and how that's unfolded
[1:02:58] itself
[1:02:59] right down to this present hour
[1:03:03] how positive is that that we're living
[1:03:05] in right now
[1:03:07] then you will understand clearly then
[1:03:09] you see on i believe
[1:03:11] what is being done so now we remember
[1:03:14] god created angels and then satan took
[1:03:16] his part and watch
[1:03:17] we're going to have to see though before
[1:03:19] we start with the chart we're before
[1:03:20] we're before the creation we're still
[1:03:22] before creation
[1:03:23] and got to create man on the earth
[1:03:27] pretty slow huh all right let's go to
[1:03:30] the next one revelations 12 verse 7
[1:03:33] says and there was war in heaven now we
[1:03:34] covered this before
[1:03:36] during the two spirits it's kind of all
[1:03:37] overlapping here for me
[1:03:39] but it's all for us to go back and you
[1:03:42] know
[1:03:42] dig up these things out of our memory
[1:03:44] and
[1:03:46] they're real right listen if god's
[1:03:49] thoughts are real
[1:03:51] if you have the thoughts of god they
[1:03:52] must be real too
[1:03:55] just like water baptism in the name of
[1:03:56] the lord jesus christ that's the thought
[1:03:58] of god
[1:03:59] that's not the thought of nicea rome
[1:04:01] that's not the thought of the
[1:04:02] theologians that's the thought of god
[1:04:05] and there was war in heaven michael and
[1:04:06] his angels fought against the dragon and
[1:04:08] the dragon fought and his angels and
[1:04:10] prophet
[1:04:10] prevailed not neither was there a place
[1:04:12] found anymore in heaven where brother
[1:04:13] brown said he said
[1:04:14] sin started in heaven but then it
[1:04:17] continued down here on earth
[1:04:20] and the great dragon was cast out that
[1:04:22] old serpent called the devil and satan
[1:04:23] which deceiveth
[1:04:25] the whole world he was cast out into the
[1:04:28] earth and his angels
[1:04:30] were cast out with him now let's go to
[1:04:32] jude 1 verse 5.
[1:04:35] watch this and i will therefore put you
[1:04:37] in remembrance
[1:04:38] though you once knew this how that the
[1:04:40] lord having saved the people out of the
[1:04:42] land of egypt
[1:04:43] afterward destroyed them that believed
[1:04:44] not now what's he talking about
[1:04:47] he saved two million of them
[1:04:51] unbelieving rascal what
[1:04:54] what uh moses called rebels
[1:04:58] he saved them gave them ten miracles
[1:05:01] wiped almost egypt off the face of the
[1:05:04] map to get them out
[1:05:06] knowing they everyone was going to turn
[1:05:07] him down and die
[1:05:09] but he did it anyway that's what jude's
[1:05:11] saying he knew what they were going to
[1:05:13] do
[1:05:13] yet he took them out right
[1:05:16] and afterwards he destroyed them that
[1:05:18] believed not
[1:05:20] and the angels which kept not their
[1:05:21] first estate what was the angel's first
[1:05:23] estate worship god
[1:05:26] that was their first estate worship god
[1:05:28] pretty easy pretty simple
[1:05:30] i'm god i created you
[1:05:34] but they kept not their first estate but
[1:05:36] left their own habitation
[1:05:38] heaven dimension that dimension not we
[1:05:41] point up but remember
[1:05:43] it's just another dimension we'll get
[1:05:45] into that later on too he hath reserved
[1:05:47] in everlasting chains
[1:05:49] under darkness and to the judgment of
[1:05:51] the great day so those angels are going
[1:05:54] to be judged but where did they go
[1:05:58] they came down here into the garden of
[1:06:01] eden but like i said before there might
[1:06:02] have been a lot of devils in the garden
[1:06:03] of eden but there was the devil
[1:06:06] head guy himself he said i'm going to
[1:06:09] deal with this
[1:06:10] i want to be god you all might not want
[1:06:12] to be god i want to be god
[1:06:15] let's go to genesis 1 1. in the
[1:06:17] beginning god created
[1:06:18] now we're almost into our chart we'll
[1:06:20] start in our chart next time we preach
[1:06:21] oh this coming sunday
[1:06:23] brother chris long will be with us both
[1:06:24] services so be praying for him they'll
[1:06:26] be
[1:06:27] flying in on friday and flying back out
[1:06:29] on
[1:06:30] well they're going to somewhere else
[1:06:33] tuesday or wednesday going to brother
[1:06:34] jewell 40s
[1:06:35] so i'll just pray for him but i'm sure
[1:06:37] he's going to bring us a truckload of
[1:06:39] preaching so in the beginning god
[1:06:41] created the heaven and the earth
[1:06:43] the earth without form and void and
[1:06:44] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[1:06:46] the spirit of the lord moved upon the
[1:06:47] face of the waters and god said let
[1:06:49] there be light
[1:06:50] we understand eyes that we explained all
[1:06:52] that brother louise myself
[1:06:54] different ones and there was light
[1:06:55] that's not the sun and the moon that's
[1:06:56] the light
[1:06:57] exactly that's the revelation that's
[1:07:00] where god is
[1:07:01] god is light and in him has no darkness
[1:07:04] at all all right so now let's go to
[1:07:06] genesis 1 25.
[1:07:08] god made the beast of the earth after
[1:07:09] his kind the cattle after their kind i
[1:07:11] got to kind of cover this because
[1:07:14] this is where we see the physical
[1:07:18] earth being formed
[1:07:23] something stand on and animals
[1:07:26] and plants and trees and mountains
[1:07:28] different things right
[1:07:30] because you got to cover this because
[1:07:31] listen that's going to enter into this
[1:07:33] dimension when we get into this chart
[1:07:35] the first three dimensions are what life
[1:07:37] light and matter
[1:07:39] right life light and matter everybody
[1:07:41] got that
[1:07:43] not eternal life life
[1:07:47] because remember once we got into the
[1:07:49] first three dimensions of life like
[1:07:51] matter there was something happen that
[1:07:53] took eternal life out of that
[1:07:57] everybody got that adam was the only one
[1:08:00] that had it
[1:08:01] god gave it to him but when he come down
[1:08:03] through here
[1:08:04] and did what he did god had to turn that
[1:08:06] light off
[1:08:08] oh sure the sun kept coming up the moon
[1:08:09] kept coming up but that light that we're
[1:08:11] talking about that light that lights the
[1:08:13] whole world
[1:08:14] it went out because god had to fold the
[1:08:17] book back up brother brown even
[1:08:19] illustrates that adam had to hand the
[1:08:20] book back to the one
[1:08:22] that owned it because he couldn't bring
[1:08:25] light anymore
[1:08:27] in other words he had to die yeah
[1:08:29] physically not spiritually
[1:08:31] he physically died but we're not
[1:08:33] supposed to spiritually die or
[1:08:35] physically die
[1:08:37] amen so he said look let us make man in
[1:08:39] our image
[1:08:41] and after our lightness and let them
[1:08:42] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[1:08:44] and fowl the air and over the cattle
[1:08:46] and over all the earth and every
[1:08:47] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[1:08:48] earth so god created man
[1:08:50] in his own image to me that's a great
[1:08:53] revelation folks
[1:08:55] he just didn't create mankind mankind
[1:08:58] came
[1:08:58] after came after that man came in life
[1:09:01] light and matter
[1:09:05] because look what is matter
[1:09:08] my hand won't go through that that's
[1:09:11] solid matter
[1:09:13] but now remember before
[1:09:16] the fall the prophet of god said said
[1:09:19] that adam
[1:09:20] ruled the world like the holy spirit
[1:09:22] rules
[1:09:24] should rule us so when jesus christ come
[1:09:27] back
[1:09:28] into the upper room with the disciples
[1:09:30] this wouldn't matter anymore
[1:09:32] this was just something even just like i
[1:09:34] believe adam could
[1:09:36] brother brown said adam could say tree
[1:09:37] move right well what would happen
[1:09:40] that tree would move
[1:09:46] that's what happened when that fall came
[1:09:48] man it just darkened the whole world
[1:09:53] but it didn't stop the plan of god
[1:09:56] it made every attribute start coming
[1:09:59] just like this
[1:10:00] savior immediately healer savior
[1:10:03] redeemer all the ones all that it
[1:10:06] started immediately
[1:10:07] and he was listen even though
[1:10:11] god knew that's what was going to happen
[1:10:13] he knew it had to happen
[1:10:15] i'm going to read that quote in just a
[1:10:16] minute that luis said i already had it
[1:10:18] part of it part of it down not the other
[1:10:20] part that he read
[1:10:21] but look so god blessed him and god said
[1:10:23] to be fruitful and multiply and
[1:10:25] replenish the earth now brother brown
[1:10:26] said
[1:10:27] this was before they were put in human
[1:10:29] flesh
[1:10:31] so you're to multiply without having
[1:10:36] human flesh involved now did you get the
[1:10:39] new birth by your human flesh
[1:10:42] no it came through your human flesh but
[1:10:44] you got the new birth by the spiritual
[1:10:46] part of god
[1:10:48] your mom and daddy brought you here by
[1:10:49] flesh right
[1:10:51] [Music]
[1:10:53] permissive but you had to get here to
[1:10:55] get us to have a soul
[1:10:56] to get a soul here to get you here so
[1:10:59] that god could
[1:11:01] sorry kill the old nature right yeah
[1:11:05] amen and god blessed him instead of then
[1:11:07] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[1:11:09] the earth and subdue it
[1:11:12] and have dominion over the fish of the
[1:11:13] sea and follow the air and ever live in
[1:11:14] creation
[1:11:15] now look that's what god wanted
[1:11:20] that's what god saw in his mind part of
[1:11:23] his plan
[1:11:25] but he knew when 2 7 came
[1:11:28] and the lord god formed man of the dust
[1:11:30] of the ground bring it up and breathed
[1:11:32] into his nostrils a breath of life
[1:11:33] man became a living soul
[1:11:38] and the lord god planted a garden
[1:11:39] eastward in eden and there he put the
[1:11:41] man
[1:11:42] whom he had formed so he knew when he
[1:11:44] put him in human flesh go to the next
[1:11:46] one genesis 2 7. there you go
[1:11:48] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[1:11:49] life
[1:11:51] and man became a living saul
[1:11:55] and lord god planted a garden eastward
[1:11:57] in eden
[1:11:58] and he put the man who had formed and
[1:12:00] then we know what happened after that
[1:12:02] there was a separation eve was made
[1:12:05] right
[1:12:07] and then we know what happened and so
[1:12:09] let's read this quote that
[1:12:11] brother louise read and then will
[1:12:15] it's pretty long but you know what it's
[1:12:16] worth it
[1:12:22] because luis you and i you and i
[1:12:24] couldn't have said it like this
[1:12:27] none of us could have said it like the
[1:12:28] prophet said it so that's why i'm going
[1:12:30] to read it like this
[1:12:32] now that we have come this far let me
[1:12:33] try to crystallize your thinking i like
[1:12:36] what he says let's crystallize your
[1:12:37] thinking on this subject
[1:12:39] so you can see the necessity of our
[1:12:42] going into the serpent seed doctrine
[1:12:44] as i have
[1:12:49] we start the fact that there were two
[1:12:50] trees and we've already been through
[1:12:52] this
[1:12:52] and how they've intertwined the tree of
[1:12:55] life was jesus the other tree is
[1:12:56] definitely satan because of what came
[1:12:58] forth of the fruit of that tree
[1:13:00] now then we know
[1:13:03] that both of these trees had a
[1:13:04] relationship to man so it's not just
[1:13:07] trees with bark on it
[1:13:08] right it was christ
[1:13:11] and the devil got it
[1:13:15] one anointed and the other one anointed
[1:13:20] they must have had a part in the
[1:13:21] sovereign plan and purpose of god in
[1:13:23] their relationship to mankind and to
[1:13:25] himself
[1:13:26] or we could never impute omniscience
[1:13:30] in other words all-knowing unto god this
[1:13:33] is all true so far is it not now the
[1:13:35] word
[1:13:36] most definitely sets forth that from
[1:13:38] before
[1:13:39] the foundation of the earth the purpose
[1:13:41] of god was to look
[1:13:43] share his eternal life with man now
[1:13:47] where did that say that
[1:13:50] where does it say that verbatim it don't
[1:13:53] i just read it to you though
[1:13:56] god said let us make man in our own
[1:13:58] image
[1:13:59] and after our likeness that's exactly
[1:14:01] what he was saying
[1:14:03] i'm gonna make an eternal man i'm gonna
[1:14:05] make somebody i can live with for an
[1:14:06] eternity and they're gonna be my
[1:14:07] children they're gonna be part of me
[1:14:08] they're gonna have part of my character
[1:14:11] share his eternal life with man
[1:14:19] ephesians one and we read this i'll read
[1:14:21] it again according he has chosen us in
[1:14:22] him before the foundation of the world
[1:14:23] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:14:25] before him in love
[1:14:26] having predestinated unto the adoption
[1:14:28] of children by jesus christ to himself
[1:14:30] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:14:31] will to the praise of the glory of his
[1:14:33] grace when he has
[1:14:35] accepted made us accepted in the beloved
[1:14:37] in whom we have redemption through his
[1:14:39] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[1:14:40] to the reaches of his grace
[1:14:42] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[1:14:44] all wisdom and prudence having made
[1:14:45] known unto us the mystery of his will
[1:14:48] according to his good pleasure which has
[1:14:49] performed in his purpose in itself
[1:14:51] and in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:14:53] of times he might gather together
[1:14:55] in one all things in christ both which
[1:14:58] are in heaven which are on earth now
[1:14:59] that's
[1:15:00] us and everything else even in him in
[1:15:02] whom also we have obtained an
[1:15:04] inheritance being predestinated
[1:15:05] according to the purpose of him who
[1:15:06] worketh all things
[1:15:08] after the council of his own will now
[1:15:09] read revelations 13 8 this prophet's
[1:15:11] reading this this is part of the quote
[1:15:14] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[1:15:15] worship him satan whose names are not
[1:15:17] written in the book of life of the lamb
[1:15:18] slain from the foundation of the world
[1:15:19] now this is the quote
[1:15:21] but that life could not and would not be
[1:15:24] shared in
[1:15:24] any other way than through the way of
[1:15:27] god
[1:15:28] manifesting in flesh
[1:15:31] everybody got that amen you may hate
[1:15:35] your flesh
[1:15:38] but this is the way you're going to be
[1:15:40] god wanted you in human flesh
[1:15:43] god is going to you're going to get a
[1:15:45] body change and you're going to live
[1:15:46] eternal
[1:15:48] in human flesh
[1:15:51] we're not spooks we're not angels we're
[1:15:53] not floating blobs
[1:15:55] we're humans we're going to walk on this
[1:15:57] earth we're going to talk on this earth
[1:15:58] we're going to have fun
[1:16:02] this was a part of his eternal and
[1:16:05] predestinated purpose
[1:16:06] right so in other words he didn't bring
[1:16:10] genesis 2 7 into being
[1:16:13] for this thing to fall apart no no no no
[1:16:17] but he knew it would if he put him in
[1:16:19] flesh
[1:16:20] right all right this was a part of his
[1:16:23] eternal and predestinated purpose this
[1:16:24] plan was to be to the praise of the
[1:16:26] glory of his grace
[1:16:28] it was the plan of redemption it was the
[1:16:31] plan of salvation now listen closely
[1:16:34] god being a savior it was necessary that
[1:16:36] he predestinated a man
[1:16:39] who would require salvation now watch
[1:16:41] look at me
[1:16:42] genesis 1 26 that's not that man
[1:16:48] that genesis 126 man never fell
[1:16:51] never fell adam fell
[1:16:54] which had part of that ending but he
[1:16:56] failed right
[1:16:58] but look predestined a
[1:17:01] man who would require salvation he put
[1:17:05] them
[1:17:05] in flesh and then when adam and eve did
[1:17:08] what they did
[1:17:10] that stopped sons and daughters of god
[1:17:12] from being born like god wanted them to
[1:17:13] be born
[1:17:15] because her wound was polluted up here
[1:17:17] and down there everybody got that
[1:17:20] and god's not gonna come listen god's
[1:17:21] not gonna dwell on an unclean vessel
[1:17:22] he's not gonna use an unclean vessel
[1:17:24] amen that would require salvation in
[1:17:27] order what to give him reason and
[1:17:30] purpose of being
[1:17:31] right that is 100 correct
[1:17:34] and multitudes of scriptures beared out
[1:17:36] as does the very pointed verse
[1:17:38] of romans 11 36 for of him and through
[1:17:42] him
[1:17:42] and to him are all things to whom be
[1:17:44] glory forever
[1:17:46] amen god could not directly come and
[1:17:48] partake of that tree of life in the
[1:17:50] midst of the garden
[1:17:52] that eternal life of the tree had to
[1:17:54] become
[1:17:55] flesh first oh
[1:17:59] man that's when he said i'll put enmity
[1:18:04] between thy seed and the seed of the
[1:18:06] woman well who's the seed of the woman
[1:18:08] christ in human flesh is the seed of the
[1:18:10] woman
[1:18:12] but before god could raise and save a
[1:18:15] sinner
[1:18:16] he had to have a sinner to raise and
[1:18:18] save
[1:18:19] man had to fall the fall which would be
[1:18:22] caused by satan had to have
[1:18:24] flesh to make fall like i said before
[1:18:27] that genesis 1 26 man that was a spirit
[1:18:29] man that man never fell
[1:18:31] that's god almighty in portions in parts
[1:18:36] that's not a type right that's him
[1:18:41] the fall which would be caused by satan
[1:18:44] had to have flesh to make fall
[1:18:46] satan had to come through flesh also but
[1:18:49] in other words satan couldn't create a
[1:18:50] human flesh and go into it he just
[1:18:52] watched
[1:18:53] god create and he said there's my point
[1:18:56] of entry right there
[1:18:58] that beast can talk here he can talk to
[1:19:02] the animals
[1:19:02] and he can coincide with that animal and
[1:19:04] he can coincide with humans
[1:19:07] but now remember god didn't say well now
[1:19:09] i'm going to create that beast and then
[1:19:10] satan's going to no
[1:19:12] creative evolution read your bible
[1:19:17] plants then birds i mean fish then birds
[1:19:21] then beast of the field and there was
[1:19:23] the beast and then there was man
[1:19:26] creative evolution all the way up all
[1:19:27] right
[1:19:29] but satan could not come through human
[1:19:30] flesh to make the fall
[1:19:32] as would christ come in human flesh to
[1:19:34] restore the fallen
[1:19:35] but there was an animal the serpent so
[1:19:37] close to man that satan could get to
[1:19:39] that beast and through that beast
[1:19:41] he could get to human flesh and cause to
[1:19:44] fall
[1:19:47] he knew he could listen he knew he
[1:19:49] couldn't touch
[1:19:52] everybody that's got the new birth in
[1:19:54] their soul
[1:19:55] there's something that satan can't touch
[1:19:59] so if adam had eternal life in his soul
[1:20:01] eve had eternal life in her soul
[1:20:02] he couldn't touch that right he couldn't
[1:20:04] change that
[1:20:07] but he could he could take the spirit
[1:20:10] because the flesh just reacted to what
[1:20:11] was going on right
[1:20:13] so satan right here but there was an
[1:20:16] animal
[1:20:17] and through that beast he could get to
[1:20:19] human flesh and cause the fault look and
[1:20:21] inject himself
[1:20:22] thereby into the human race even as
[1:20:24] jesus
[1:20:25] would one day come and inject himself
[1:20:28] into the human race
[1:20:30] into human bodies even to the extent of
[1:20:32] a resurrection where we would have
[1:20:34] bodies like his glorified one
[1:20:36] let's talk about me and you
[1:20:40] that's what god worked out here in the
[1:20:42] garden was his predestinated plan
[1:20:45] and when satan had brought about that
[1:20:47] which was necessary to the purpose of
[1:20:48] god
[1:20:49] then man could not get to the tree of
[1:20:52] life in the garden
[1:20:53] why it went back to the original law it
[1:20:56] went god had to step out of that
[1:20:57] dimension
[1:20:58] he had to let the first three dimensions
[1:21:00] life light and matter
[1:21:02] right no more eternal life in the
[1:21:04] dimension
[1:21:06] have i got that that's why you've got
[1:21:09] your dimensions and thank god it took a
[1:21:10] profit to tell us exactly where those
[1:21:12] dimensions were
[1:21:15] you know what i believe happened you
[1:21:16] know what the first three dimensions are
[1:21:17] the slowest dimension so i just believe
[1:21:19] god slowed everything down he just
[1:21:20] stepped back up into
[1:21:22] into another dimension he just stepped
[1:21:24] over into another dimension he didn't
[1:21:25] leave
[1:21:27] he was still in the garden right i just
[1:21:30] where'd he go he's almighty god he knows
[1:21:33] what's going to happen the next day and
[1:21:35] the next day the next day
[1:21:36] so he knows where to be which means i'm
[1:21:38] omniscient i'm the i'm the president i'm
[1:21:40] the president
[1:21:41] right i'm the president who knows where
[1:21:42] to be when he needs to be there all
[1:21:44] right
[1:21:45] but man couldn't get back adam had done
[1:21:49] what he did eve had done what she did in
[1:21:51] flesh
[1:21:52] they couldn't get back to that spiritual
[1:21:54] tree
[1:21:56] to that light they couldn't get back to
[1:21:59] it
[1:22:01] and even though adam
[1:22:04] typed christ and took eve and sheltered
[1:22:07] her and didn't have sex with her to save
[1:22:08] her good lord and mercy
[1:22:11] but he did shelter her and he said i'll
[1:22:13] take on god i don't
[1:22:14] i don't create another one she's me
[1:22:18] now that type christ we know that and
[1:22:20] i'm sure christ said oh man
[1:22:23] but remember adam thought he could get
[1:22:27] yourself
[1:22:27] get him back in the garden he's not the
[1:22:30] savior
[1:22:31] he had every act of it see you have the
[1:22:33] attribute of god inside of you today
[1:22:35] right
[1:22:35] but you're not the savior to save the
[1:22:37] world
[1:22:39] amen because he's the
[1:22:42] he's the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:22:44] which is all those titles
[1:22:47] you and i don't have all those titles
[1:22:49] we're part of those titles
[1:22:51] but we don't have to we don't have to
[1:22:52] get on a cross and die and my
[1:22:55] spirit can't go into brother donny but
[1:22:58] if we're born again we've got the same
[1:22:59] holy ghost in our soul
[1:23:01] by the new birth he puts us right back
[1:23:03] to where we should have been had there
[1:23:06] not been a fall
[1:23:09] and when satan had brought about that
[1:23:10] which was necessary to the purpose of
[1:23:13] god
[1:23:13] then man could not get to the tree of
[1:23:15] life in the garden certainly not
[1:23:17] it wasn't time but an animal
[1:23:20] animal had caused a fall had it not let
[1:23:22] animal life be shed and was taken
[1:23:24] his blood shed and god had communion
[1:23:26] with man again remember what was the
[1:23:27] first thing god did
[1:23:28] kill the lamb throw the skins in and
[1:23:30] said put them on
[1:23:33] sacrifice right the animal
[1:23:38] would be a substitute
[1:23:41] in this dimension right these first
[1:23:43] three dimensions the animal is a
[1:23:45] substitute
[1:23:46] but i'm god and i'm going to step over
[1:23:49] another dimension
[1:23:51] because i'm what jehovah it was jehovah
[1:23:54] with his family but jehovah didn't go on
[1:23:55] vacation
[1:23:57] he was sitting right there
[1:24:00] leading them right through knowing what
[1:24:03] they'd do but you know what he knew what
[1:24:04] you'd do
[1:24:06] and saved you anyway too so don't feel
[1:24:08] so
[1:24:11] but look but god had communion with man
[1:24:14] again
[1:24:15] then there was to come a day when god
[1:24:17] would appear in flesh
[1:24:18] and by means of what by means of his
[1:24:21] humiliation
[1:24:23] he would restore fallen man and make him
[1:24:25] a partaker
[1:24:27] of that life eternal see adam couldn't
[1:24:29] impart eternal life
[1:24:31] to anybody else he wasn't the savior he
[1:24:33] wasn't the
[1:24:34] fullness of the godhead bodily but that
[1:24:36] man the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:24:38] he's the one that stood and said right
[1:24:42] let us make man in our image we forget
[1:24:44] that sometimes
[1:24:46] that same man who stood on earth
[1:24:49] it's the same man his soul was the soul
[1:24:52] of almighty god
[1:24:56] once you see this you can understand the
[1:24:57] serpent seed and know there was no apple
[1:24:59] eva
[1:25:00] no it was the degradation of humanity
[1:25:03] by ingermingle intermingling what
[1:25:05] natural seed
[1:25:07] not spiritual seed remember we all come
[1:25:09] now by natural seed
[1:25:10] but don't worry the seed of the woman
[1:25:14] which woman doesn't have a seed so she
[1:25:15] has to get one the seed of the woman
[1:25:18] come by jesus christ
[1:25:20] virgin birth to bring the plan
[1:25:25] the fruition let's go right here genesis
[1:25:27] 3 15. we'll be done right here
[1:25:28] musicians get ready to come i got two
[1:25:30] things to read we're going to talk about
[1:25:32] a book and a couple of
[1:25:33] couple more maybe next service
[1:25:37] and i will put enmity between then the
[1:25:40] woman
[1:25:41] and between thy seed who's you talking
[1:25:43] to
[1:25:44] the serpent thy seed
[1:25:48] and her seed there's your two spirits
[1:25:52] thy seed is satan her seed can't be a
[1:25:56] woman
[1:25:57] it's got to be her given seed it shall
[1:26:00] bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise
[1:26:02] his heel
[1:26:03] until the woman he said i will greatly
[1:26:05] multiply by sorrow
[1:26:06] and in thy conception and in sorrow thou
[1:26:10] shalt bring forth children
[1:26:12] and thy desire shall be to thy husband
[1:26:13] and he shall rule
[1:26:15] over thee and adam said because thou
[1:26:18] hast hearken
[1:26:18] and he sorry and unto adam he said
[1:26:21] because thou has
[1:26:22] hearkened unto the voice of your wife
[1:26:24] and has eaten of the tree
[1:26:25] of which i commanded these things
[1:26:27] remember that was your covenant
[1:26:28] if you eat it this is what's going to
[1:26:30] happen if you don't this will happen
[1:26:32] thou shalt not eat if it curses the
[1:26:34] ground
[1:26:35] for your sake in sorrow
[1:26:39] thou shalt eat of it all the days of thy
[1:26:42] life
[1:26:43] thorns and thistles shall it bring forth
[1:26:45] to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of
[1:26:47] the field
[1:26:48] in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
[1:26:50] bread till thou return to the ground for
[1:26:52] out of that what's thou taken for dust
[1:26:54] thou art
[1:26:55] now that was not supposed to be
[1:26:59] but because of the fall people had to
[1:27:01] die
[1:27:03] so he's going to go right back to the
[1:27:04] garden and adam called his wife's name
[1:27:07] eve because she was the mother of all
[1:27:09] living unto adam also and to his wife
[1:27:11] did the lord make coats of skins
[1:27:14] and clothe them in other words as we
[1:27:16] read the quote many times before let us
[1:27:18] stand
[1:27:18] i'm going to read one more so leave that
[1:27:20] up musicians get ready to come
[1:27:23] as i said before excuse me
[1:27:28] we look and we see that adam called his
[1:27:30] wife eating
[1:27:31] wife's name eve because she was the
[1:27:33] mother of all living it didn't say adam
[1:27:35] was the mother but father of all living
[1:27:37] because there was a seed injected into
[1:27:40] eve that was not his
[1:27:41] amen called the serpent seed that's
[1:27:44] where the i will put enmity
[1:27:46] a division but now listen
[1:27:50] at that time then christ couldn't come
[1:27:55] me and you couldn't come paul peter
[1:27:58] james
[1:27:58] john nobody could come like god wanted
[1:28:02] the first plan
[1:28:03] now listen he didn't like i said i can't
[1:28:05] say this any other way he had a perfect
[1:28:07] plan
[1:28:07] but one point the plan he saw remember
[1:28:09] his infinite
[1:28:10] plan he saw was that there was no fall
[1:28:13] right
[1:28:15] he's infinite but he saw man would fall
[1:28:19] therefore he made the plan and we're
[1:28:21] going to look at it on the chart here
[1:28:22] because look god stayed in eternity
[1:28:27] he's an eternal person i don't care
[1:28:29] where he's at even david said you leave
[1:28:31] my soul in hell
[1:28:33] right but he stayed up here and what
[1:28:36] happened the fall
[1:28:37] brought us down into time and the time
[1:28:40] is the first three dimensions life
[1:28:42] light and matter
[1:28:46] but guess what's going to happen what is
[1:28:49] redemption
[1:28:49] whatever's fallen is going to be taken
[1:28:52] back out
[1:28:52] right it's going to be restored now
[1:28:55] listen
[1:28:56] most people think that that restoration
[1:28:58] is going to be
[1:28:59] somewhere out the under it started on
[1:29:02] the day of pentecost
[1:29:05] god didn't get into coats of skins of
[1:29:07] animals he got into the coats and skins
[1:29:10] of human beings
[1:29:12] and it did not stop the plan of god he
[1:29:14] just wrote this right here in the book
[1:29:16] of psalms i love this psalm 139 verse 15
[1:29:20] my substance was not hid from thee
[1:29:25] when i was made in secret and curiously
[1:29:29] wrought
[1:29:31] in your mom and daddy
[1:29:35] in the lowest parts of the earth
[1:29:37] everybody understand what i'm talking
[1:29:38] about
[1:29:40] i was made in secret and curiously
[1:29:42] wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
[1:29:43] your mom and dad didn't know who you
[1:29:44] were didn't even know when we were born
[1:29:46] it was it was a surprise for a boy and
[1:29:49] girl or a girl right
[1:29:50] you had the way the kid was born before
[1:29:52] you knew what the gender was
[1:29:54] so it was all left up into the hands of
[1:29:56] god but when
[1:29:57] look he said my substance was not hid
[1:30:00] from thee
[1:30:01] when i was made in secret and curiously
[1:30:03] wrought in the lowest parts
[1:30:04] of the earth thine eyes did see
[1:30:09] my substance yet
[1:30:13] being imperfect
[1:30:18] knowing we'd fall knowing we'd go do the
[1:30:20] things of the world knowing we would do
[1:30:22] all the
[1:30:22] knowing we wouldn't even want god
[1:30:23] brother gary for a long period of time
[1:30:25] in our life
[1:30:26] right and then we get jumbled up into
[1:30:29] everything else
[1:30:30] knowing yet being unperfect but look
[1:30:33] and in my book all my members were
[1:30:36] written
[1:30:37] right which in continuance were
[1:30:40] fashioned
[1:30:41] when as yet there was none of them in
[1:30:44] other words you came
[1:30:45] i came paul came peter came
[1:30:48] who would have known you never you never
[1:30:50] know anything about the apostle paul
[1:30:52] whether he had brothers or sisters or
[1:30:54] whatever
[1:30:55] but his mom and daddy brought paul on
[1:30:56] this earth
[1:30:58] curiously wrought in the lowest parts of
[1:31:00] the earth he was named saul
[1:31:02] at the time and he was probably when he
[1:31:03] was a little kid if he was like he was
[1:31:05] when he was older
[1:31:06] he was beating up on the kids hook knows
[1:31:09] you brother brown said hi
[1:31:10] tempered all right but god
[1:31:16] saw his substance before the foundation
[1:31:19] of the world
[1:31:20] and he said i like that guy
[1:31:24] i like that guy i think i'm gonna use
[1:31:27] him
[1:31:29] and in the book all my members were
[1:31:33] written
[1:31:34] i'll never forget when you read when i
[1:31:36] read that quote brother brown said
[1:31:38] god's got an album god's got a family
[1:31:41] album he's got a book that i
[1:31:43] oh he looked at before the foundational
[1:31:45] world and here goes everybody by
[1:31:49] but we had to get here first which in
[1:31:52] continuance were fashioned
[1:31:54] when as yet you weren't even on the
[1:31:56] earth
[1:31:59] when he was on the cross i
[1:32:03] was on his mind god bless you
[1:32:06] come on musicians let's sing a song
[1:32:10] in thy book all my members were written
[1:32:15] which in continuance were fashioned when
[1:32:18] as yet
[1:32:21] there was none of them right right when
[1:32:24] yet you were just nothing but a
[1:32:26] glimmer in your mom and daddy's eye
[1:32:31] we had to come the way we come because
[1:32:34] of what happened in the fall
[1:32:36] it stopped sons and daughters of god
[1:32:37] from being born but only temporarily
[1:32:41] when christ come on earth that was at
[1:32:43] genesis 3 15
[1:32:45] being fulfilled i'm here i'm going to
[1:32:48] see this plan
[1:32:49] fulfilled and then i'm going to come
[1:32:51] back into my believers
[1:32:53] and i'm going to fulfill this plan of
[1:32:56] redemption let's sing a song god bless
[1:32:58] you
[1:32:59] when the redeemed amen i am thinking of
[1:33:02] the rapture in our blessed home on high
[1:33:06] when the redeem our gathering
[1:33:09] in glory
[1:33:14] and the midnight city in the sky
[1:33:17] when the redeemed are gathering and
[1:33:20] think about
[1:33:23] [Music]
[1:33:30] what are we gathering we're gathering
[1:33:32] around the word of god
[1:33:39] [Music]
[1:33:49] but let's have a little party now
[1:33:52] and let's not invite the devil to this
[1:33:54] one
[1:33:55] he's gonna show up anyway but let's have
[1:33:58] a time for me and you
[1:34:01] our gathering
[1:34:05] [Music]
[1:34:13] [Music]
[1:34:16] oh
[1:34:20] [Music]
