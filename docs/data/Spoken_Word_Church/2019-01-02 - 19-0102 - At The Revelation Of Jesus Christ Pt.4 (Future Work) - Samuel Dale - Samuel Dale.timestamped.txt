[5:00] get all of that together you know all
[5:03] right
[5:04] verse seven that the trial of your faith
[5:08] being much more precious than of gold
[5:10] that purchased though it be tried with
[5:12] fire might be found unto praise and
[5:15] honor and glory at the appearing of
[5:18] Jesus Christ whom having not seen you
[5:22] love in him go now you see him not yet
[5:26] believing you rejoice with joy
[5:28] unspeakable and full of glory receiving
[5:32] the end of your set faith even the
[5:34] salvation of your souls which salvation
[5:38] the prophets have inquired and desired
[5:41] diligently who prophesied of the grace
[5:43] that should come unto you searching
[5:47] water what manner of time the Spirit of
[5:50] Christ which was in them did signify
[5:52] when it testified beforehand the
[5:55] sufferings of Christ
[5:57] and the glory that should be should
[5:59] follow under whom it was revealed that
[6:02] not unto themselves but unto us they did
[6:06] minister the things which are now
[6:08] reported unto you by them that have
[6:11] preached the gospel unto you with the
[6:13] Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which
[6:16] things the angels desire to look into
[6:19] wherefore gird up the loins of your mind
[6:21] be sober and hope to the end for the
[6:25] grace that is to be brought unto you at
[6:28] the revelation of Jesus Christ let's go
[6:33] over to revelations 1 the revelation of
[6:41] Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to
[6:44] show unto his servants things which must
[6:46] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[6:50] signified it by his angel unto his
[6:52] servant John who by record of the word
[6:55] of God and of the testimony of Jesus
[6:57] Christ and of all things that he saw
[6:59] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[7:02] hear the words of this prophecy
[7:04] what about blessing - just to get to
[7:06] hear it and to read it huh and keep
[7:09] those things which are written therein
[7:10] for the time is at hand you may be
[7:13] seated
[7:14] the Lord that is blessing to the reading
[7:16] of the word then we we were in our life
[7:21] service when we were taken we were
[7:23] trying to talk a little bit about the
[7:27] writing of the Bible and we'll try to
[7:30] pull that the end and then move up and
[7:33] some to help us to understand the coast
[7:37] to me
[7:40] if we're going to believe the Bible has
[7:42] to be that what we teach it as to be you
[7:47] know the revelation of Jesus Christ
[7:49] right so then it's not trying to find
[7:56] necessarily a mystery you know something
[8:01] that maybe we look at it oh oh that's a
[8:03] mystery that's a mystery the entire
[8:05] Bible is a mystery Wow and it has to be
[8:11] revealed all right so then it's and in
[8:15] that doing then it's a writing of the
[8:19] Word of God our God's Way of bringing to
[8:22] you and I his understanding throughout
[8:27] the entire Bible and we talk about
[8:30] Hebrews 13:8 you know as to be in Jesus
[8:33] Christ the same yesterday today and
[8:35] forever well then that would be back in
[8:37] the Old Testament as well as the new and
[8:40] that's why we read that scripture of
[8:41] were that even the Apostles and things
[8:44] they desire to look into these things
[8:47] and they saw certain things they saw
[8:49] something was happening you know and
[8:52] they could follow it to a degree
[8:54] all right and truly it was a mystery but
[8:58] yet there was a lot of those things that
[9:00] was brought into their understanding and
[9:04] then opened up to word that people could
[9:07] see the things that was taking place and
[9:11] know for sure 'ti something was
[9:13] happening you know it wasn't just that
[9:17] that they were saying oh yeah well okay
[9:19] well I said I enjoyed that you know I
[9:21] think now something was happening and
[9:24] that's what I've tried my best to make
[9:27] the emphasis to each one of us to where
[9:31] we can follow it that in the writing of
[9:35] the Bible no matter where it be old New
[9:37] Testament or whatever it is it's the
[9:41] writing of about the revelation of God
[9:45] to man alright so then that would be the
[9:49] revelation of Jesus Christ the Prophet
[9:52] says if you don't see Christ in
[9:53] reverse go back to read it again all
[9:56] right cause it's dire in the word all
[9:59] right and then doing that then it turned
[10:01] out to be a wonderful thing because we
[10:06] we got up to this point kind of and
[10:08] we'll emphasize a little of it and then
[10:10] move on that you know in the writing of
[10:15] the Bible you've got things that how do
[10:21] you state that you you got things that
[10:24] are written in the Bible that was
[10:27] already passed already happened before
[10:32] it was ever written down when I see like
[10:36] Genesis you know and Moses and the
[10:39] things like that that you've got those
[10:41] things that were there already made
[10:45] manifest you know alive all right then
[10:51] it was pinned down and it becomes the
[10:55] Bible within that away see you're not
[10:57] trying to as I said find some mysterious
[11:01] secret coding of something because man
[11:04] has done that all the time he tries to
[11:06] find a code or something that's there
[11:09] that would tell him this and he can see
[11:11] this and you know through the codes that
[11:14] are there in the Bible and all that's
[11:16] well and good but I never did understand
[11:17] it but I like it this way because this
[11:21] is kind of the life stops and we'll pick
[11:23] up a little bit here from it as I said
[11:28] then the Bible in the writing that some
[11:34] of it had been made manifest a long time
[11:38] you know already happened realities etc
[11:42] before that it was pinned down okay all
[11:48] right now so then you would have if we
[11:52] talk about Hebrews 13:8 PI's present
[11:55] future okay and so you've got like Moses
[11:59] etc the things like that is written as
[12:03] to something that was in his writing of
[12:07] Genesis
[12:08] all of that had done transpired over if
[12:11] you try to calculate the time it would
[12:14] be on over a couple of thousand years at
[12:17] least you know before the accounts were
[12:21] written and all all right but that was
[12:24] still making Hebrews 13:8 because he
[12:28] would be the same now when it would come
[12:31] to the point now this was my point of
[12:34] driving if you could take the part of
[12:38] say Moses and the writing of the book
[12:40] and the writing of it after it's done
[12:43] taking place a long time you know
[12:45] and who would how would he know what
[12:47] happened to Genesis you know those
[12:50] things but he knew it by revelation
[12:53] alright see then that would be paced
[12:57] okay
[12:59] then Moses would come on the scene and
[13:02] you know live out his life and he would
[13:06] write the things of that well that would
[13:10] bring that the way I think about see
[13:13] that would bring that to present tense
[13:17] because now he's writing all of the Pais
[13:21] when he starts writing the the points
[13:26] and you don't do it some of that he was
[13:28] living what he was talking about all
[13:31] right so you got Pais you got something
[13:34] present and then he wrote of the future
[13:37] to come all right and see that would be
[13:41] the same theme for the entire Bible
[13:45] all right that was my point of trying to
[13:48] get it see truth in you and how Hebrews
[13:49] 13:8 they didn't be the same yesterday
[13:53] today and forever that would bring it
[13:55] out to a perfect point all right we
[13:58] talked about you know the Bible showing
[14:03] us some things that has been and it's
[14:07] those things that has taken place and
[14:09] then it shows the future all right but
[14:13] now here's where we try to pick up our
[14:15] thought but remember the one point that
[14:19] I tried to emphasize to us on the last
[14:23] message that we need to see or
[14:28] understand that it's not now listen it's
[14:36] not the Word of God until it's made
[14:42] alive all right now that was the last
[14:46] point we were dealing with you say yes
[14:48] the Word of God is wrote down that's
[14:50] God's Word yeah but now you're you're
[14:53] you you've got a problem because some of
[14:57] that if you're looking at has already
[14:58] happened and some of it is happening and
[15:03] some of it is to come so you're you're
[15:07] you're losing out on the point of what
[15:10] we're trying to get see to me when the
[15:13] word is made alive now you're talking
[15:16] about God's Word now you're talking
[15:18] about the written Bible all right to
[15:23] when things are made alive they not just
[15:27] are made manifest not just talking not
[15:30] just writing letters
[15:33] all right but when that that was written
[15:36] becomes a reality it was written see
[15:40] that the children of Israel would be 400
[15:44] years and we know they went 34 more but
[15:46] it was written in what we would call the
[15:50] Bible that they would be in Egypt for
[15:52] 400 years all right but when they come
[15:55] forth to live what was written or when
[15:59] that becomes to a present tense form you
[16:03] know right while they were living 30
[16:05] years was added because of the
[16:08] transgression right all right so then
[16:13] when you were coming to the alive word
[16:16] in other words when you come down to
[16:18] that that was written as it's being made
[16:22] alive you see in that that mankind begin
[16:25] to not understand he began to fail on
[16:29] his comprehension of what God was trying
[16:33] to do and as he did even God had to add
[16:38] time to him to make it work out all
[16:42] right what's he then when that was
[16:44] finished now you know and they become
[16:48] alive and the children of Israel comes
[16:50] down and they're leaving out of Egypt
[16:52] they're going they're fulfilling what
[16:55] the Bible had said are the words the
[16:58] letters the prophets had written about
[17:00] it they begin to fulfill that so it
[17:05] began to get to a personal point all
[17:10] right
[17:11] something made into reality or alive
[17:14] okay
[17:15] then it would speak of the future our
[17:20] prophecy our see it would be a prophecy
[17:23] you know like when you'd get on over the
[17:25] New Testament Paul saying I think you
[17:27] know this be changed the moment we live
[17:29] and I
[17:29] etc see then he's prophesying of
[17:32] something to come that is not in total
[17:36] reality right there at that time so
[17:39] you're following in that what see the
[17:41] entire Bible is written that away so
[17:44] Moses
[17:46] would come on the scene and then he
[17:49] would write of what had been then he
[17:54] would write of what is our present tense
[17:58] huh and then he would write even in the
[18:01] future to come so the same thing Apollo
[18:04] that's what that's why that it's it's a
[18:07] wonderful thing to me to read the Bible
[18:10] and look at it and and look at it and
[18:13] say well you know that's already been
[18:14] fulfilled but then look at it and steady
[18:19] it and read some other so yeah but now
[18:21] there's some of it's not been fulfilled
[18:27] now do you think that's gonna come to
[18:29] pies I sure hope you think it's going to
[18:33] be if it is the Word of God it's going
[18:35] to be come into a reality
[18:37] all right so you get what I'm talking
[18:39] about now the Bible is the entire and
[18:42] the entire Bible is the revelation of
[18:45] Jesus Christ
[18:48] me whether it be of the past present or
[18:53] future
[18:54] all right now it is necessary and listen
[19:01] to my point now Moses wrote pinned you
[19:07] know the Bible but now when he pinned
[19:13] the Bible it was necessary that someone
[19:17] come on the scene and live what he had
[19:22] written are you following me see now
[19:26] you're getting to the alive word you
[19:28] getting to the reality of things to her
[19:32] that you're looking at it in the right
[19:34] order see the Bible is not only the
[19:37] written letter
[19:40] it's the living word made alive this
[19:49] Bible has been made alive by mankind now
[19:56] there are things in here that will get
[19:59] on this we're covering more later that
[20:01] hasn't taken place yet all right now
[20:06] that is the letter written right but
[20:13] that's not the alive word follow the
[20:17] point that was my emphasis all the way
[20:19] through trying to get it to that one
[20:21] thing that we look at the Bible as to be
[20:26] letters on the page instead of looking
[20:31] at it as being people that were actually
[20:36] living it you know actually making it
[20:44] alive when when it was written that the
[20:49] children of Israel would be down there
[20:50] for so many you know 400 all right but
[20:53] see then it was written back there that
[20:55] they would go out with a strong hand
[20:57] all right so Moses writing of what is to
[21:02] be and how to get and then he's speaking
[21:04] of a prophecy to bring it to the future
[21:07] all right but now once he speaks of it
[21:10] to the future see then he must back up I
[21:14] don't know maybe not the correct way to
[21:16] presenting it but just try to get the
[21:19] point he backs up to live
[21:23] what he wrote okay now coach don't you
[21:29] believe that someday somebody is going
[21:32] to be changed in a moment between you
[21:35] and I right come see if they didn't if
[21:38] it does not happen then Paul would be
[21:42] wrong and that wouldn't be the written
[21:45] word of God that would be letters that
[21:48] could be questioned all right Missy I
[21:51] believe in a reality of a living God
[21:56] a living people are people to make alive
[22:03] rather brown call it the the outer
[22:06] descent the young the fact of these
[22:09] letters on the page made alive into our
[22:12] hearts he said then it becomes a reality
[22:17] all right alive all right
[22:23] but now until someone comes to change in
[22:27] a moment wink of an eye that is still
[22:30] prophecy
[22:33] and let me quote the Prophet he said
[22:36] long just letting I like that what he
[22:37] say it can be questioned but he said
[22:41] once it's made alive he said it can't be
[22:46] questioned the more he said now when the
[22:50] Bible would speak and say a virgin shall
[22:53] conceive he said but one day that became
[22:59] a reality you know a living word all
[23:05] right now so then we're not talking
[23:09] about the Bible to me is not just
[23:12] letters on the page you know
[23:17] this message that the Prophet brought is
[23:20] just not letter letters on the page or
[23:22] on the tape or whatever there's things
[23:27] the Prophet spoke that we've seen come
[23:30] to Pais but there's things that he spoke
[23:34] has not come to pies and see then we
[23:40] have to sometimes wait on that to be
[23:43] made into a reality but it's blitt the
[23:47] believers in the Bible is the Word of
[23:50] God
[23:50] all right now follow the point now so
[23:53] what's what's what we're getting to now
[23:55] so then second Corinthians three and two
[24:00] says you are our epistles written
[24:06] in our heart known and read of all man
[24:13] that's really emphasized just a little
[24:17] bit more than what we do in doing
[24:20] because most of the time would you say
[24:21] you are written epistles or we are
[24:24] written epistles but see actually to me
[24:29] it's saying you are our epistles written
[24:35] in our heart see then that way it can be
[24:44] read of all men in you now here's the
[24:51] point we'll try to pick up which is the
[24:53] greatest to think of is that we have the
[24:59] Bible you know thank God you know praise
[25:05] God we've got the Bible but which do you
[25:08] think is greater of having the letters
[25:10] of the page
[25:14] no now listen to the point and the
[25:18] letters of the page that a lot of that's
[25:20] already happened and proved to be true
[25:24] but see this message takes it into a
[25:30] deeper form because this message takes
[25:34] it to a living reality all right
[25:38] then which one do you want letters on
[25:40] the page we've had that the Prophet said
[25:43] as long as it lays there it could be
[25:46] questioned oh no no it can't well that's
[25:50] what he said it so you know but once
[25:54] it's made alive he said it can't be
[25:56] questioned all right
[25:59] see though so that was a day then the
[26:02] children of Israel had to leave Egypt to
[26:06] fulfill what Moses had written you know
[26:14] see then it could become a living
[26:17] reality
[26:18] are you are you Father which one you
[26:20] draw the house with brother dad I want
[26:22] to Bible now to me I'm hope I'm not dumb
[26:34] a little stupid and all like that but
[26:35] not totally but to me I'm not talking
[26:41] about mistakes and things that happen
[26:47] but rather made mistakes but random talk
[26:50] things he had to correct all right now
[26:54] but there's nothing in the Bible
[27:00] my father there's nothing in the ladder
[27:04] that would be wrong now we had the wrong
[27:08] cause we had the wrong interpretations
[27:12] we had you know all of that but there's
[27:16] nothing wrong with the written letter of
[27:18] the word come on your prophet said it
[27:24] what he said we have what the divine to
[27:30] see the divine interpretation with
[27:32] revelation how did he say that it's it's
[27:35] something in other words what he's
[27:38] saying to me he's saying I'd rather have
[27:43] the alive word than the how the letters
[27:49] on the page because the letters on the
[27:53] page can be questioned all right but
[27:56] once it comes into your heart it can't
[27:58] be now may I Ella straight it like this
[28:01] we used to read Matthew 28:19
[28:06] right now you didn't say what we felt it
[28:10] said but we thought it said right we
[28:12] thought it said that we thought it said
[28:15] Father Son and Holy Ghost now we know it
[28:18] didn't do that but now get the point of
[28:21] what I'm saying letters on the page says
[28:25] Father Son and Holy Ghost
[28:31] but a revelation says Lord Jesus Christ
[28:36] then which one you drew the house well
[28:41] I'll just take about within come on come
[28:45] on you're not thinking with me the way
[28:47] come on try to think the way I think
[28:49] sometimes that's crazy I guess but see
[28:53] we we took the Bible and proved three
[28:58] gods
[29:00] read the Bible people are still doing
[29:04] that today around the world they're
[29:08] reading the Bible and still teaching the
[29:11] Trinity they're reading the Bible and
[29:14] baptizing in the name of the Father Son
[29:17] and Holy Ghost but that's not the Bible
[29:22] as letters on the page that we've
[29:25] translated to mean what we want it to
[29:27] mean
[29:29] because the Bible never said Father Son
[29:32] and Holy Ghost he says in the name of
[29:37] the father not names it never said what
[29:44] we thought it was saying so now which
[29:47] one do you want you know people of this
[29:51] message that's what they'll do a lot of
[29:52] time you see them come along you know
[29:54] and they'll follow the message your
[29:56] wallet and you'll see them dump one way
[29:58] or the other
[30:00] and they'll go one form of the other
[30:01] they'll either go back to to their old
[30:03] denominational ideas and thoughts are
[30:06] either you know and do away with the we
[30:09] don't believe the message we believe the
[30:11] Bible
[30:12] all right or either they'll say we we
[30:16] believe the message and don't believe
[30:18] the Bible you know you know what I'm
[30:21] talking about true you see how could you
[30:25] have that this message is either the
[30:33] Word of God made into a reality
[30:37] taken off of the letters of the page and
[30:40] brought into our hearts by revelation or
[30:45] either we've missed it now come on see
[30:52] people could argue with you when you
[30:54] believe in a Trinity
[30:56] because see you couldn't argue back you
[31:01] know I did my brother he taught a
[31:02] Trinity and CI that's a good old
[31:06] Baptists out of one God let's eat come
[31:09] to find it out I was just much
[31:11] Trinitarian as he was but I didn't see
[31:14] it that way because I didn't believe in
[31:17] three guards
[31:23] my point is this and they take away from
[31:28] you your baptism let me just ask you
[31:34] that can mankind take your baptism away
[31:39] from you
[31:40] you know what I'm talking about can they
[31:45] take it and make it go back to Father
[31:47] Son and Holy Ghost why why is it they
[31:54] can't do it because they are theological
[31:57] they have their points they have the
[31:59] emphases and they gain ground every day
[32:01] on how to present it how come they can't
[32:03] do that because it's been a made alive
[32:11] in your heart but it's been made alive
[32:18] that Lord Jesus Christ is the correct
[32:21] way cause if not you just arguing you're
[32:27] fussing through the people but when it's
[32:30] revealed it solves it well look at all
[32:36] the emphases all the things that are
[32:38] done and putting it you know that
[32:39] brother Branham is this and he was so
[32:41] wrong and this was wrong you know he was
[32:43] that and look at all of the great things
[32:45] that are happening
[32:48] but you see Church I told them they were
[32:51] arguing in the seventies about the dates
[32:55] and the situations and things being
[32:57] wrong the brother around him and his
[32:59] huntin and thought and I told him then
[33:03] I said look do not argue with a man
[33:12] you're arguing of whether or not the
[33:17] Word of God is real you realize that if
[33:21] you're gonna take the emphasis well
[33:23] brother Brennan said if you catch me
[33:25] wrong in one place that I'm wrong all
[33:27] the way well that's how I was a problem
[33:29] code I can take there in a hurry I can
[33:31] show you one where he said he was wrong
[33:33] now what are you gonna do see you're
[33:37] gonna say well I see that he's gonna
[33:39] just do like just tore it down and quit
[33:41] well then what are you gonna do when
[33:43] they come along with something else and
[33:45] try to give it to you were you gonna
[33:49] throw that down how long's it gonna take
[33:51] you to run that out
[33:58] let's see I told him in I said I don't
[34:00] care what you prove that brother branham
[34:03] was wrong here rather random was wrong
[34:05] dire I said he's led me to the Lord
[34:09] Jesus Christ and see then I don't worry
[34:16] about what it was right or wrong
[34:19] humanly yeah a lot of wrong yeah
[34:22] but revelation wise ain't no wrong to it
[34:25] there's no problems with the message
[34:28] there are no no mistakes in the message
[34:33] another messenger he made mistake we
[34:38] know that but then when he would come
[34:44] back and correct that mistake then show
[34:50] the truth of what it was getting it from
[34:55] past letters on the page to present
[34:59] tense to seeing it happening now and
[35:01] going on into the future with what
[35:04] you're looking at
[35:09] then you can follow it in the correct
[35:11] line and the Prophet said the people was
[35:20] the written Bible that's the written
[35:26] Bible made it live it's not just letters
[35:30] on a page see we look at it still
[35:32] there's a written Bible we call it
[35:34] letters or a painting no I'm not talking
[35:35] about that I'm talking about to the
[35:38] point that it's real and they can't take
[35:40] it away from you well I've got some
[35:48] problems I just don't understand this
[35:49] donor well coming let's talk about it go
[35:55] see either the message is right or wrong
[36:02] it's either right or wrong
[36:04] well I mean you know well let's sit down
[36:07] and discuss what what it is but let's
[36:10] don't get into our silly little you know
[36:12] thoughts of our own selves and what
[36:14] we're doing letters on the page will
[36:20] kill us
[36:22] look at the people that quote quote
[36:24] quote quote quote quote well you know
[36:26] brother runs message all the way down
[36:28] through there and then look at them now
[36:38] but now think about it cuz this is what
[36:44] I want you to look at go ahead a number
[36:45] one we'll pull up will start you know I
[36:48] doubt we get through tonight I want to
[36:50] bring but anyhow the seed of discrepancy
[36:58] he's bringing out a point for thoughts
[37:00] uh come down through the middle now back
[37:08] the other way where we started let's see
[37:13] we'll start right here save reading he
[37:18] was listen
[37:20] he was the interpretation of the word
[37:27] that time what Jesus Christ are talking
[37:30] about coming down and riders and even to
[37:32] the prophets and think they were the
[37:35] interpretation of the Word of God
[37:40] alright now look he was the
[37:44] interpretation of the word of God and
[37:46] ever born again son and daughter of God
[37:49] of this age is the interpretation of the
[37:55] word you are written epistles read of
[38:01] all men yes what about being the
[38:07] interpretation Jesus Christ was the
[38:13] interpretation of the Word of God
[38:15] right in other words the word
[38:17] interpreting her brought her alive he
[38:19] made it alive all right then he would
[38:22] say what he'd say show me were that I'm
[38:26] off the word my words tell me where I'm
[38:31] missing the word where I'm not
[38:33] fulfilling the word to the letter
[38:36] I'm fulfilling what was said about me he
[38:40] said because he was the interpretation
[38:43] of the word but think about yourself and
[38:50] you'll understand what I said a moment
[38:52] ago when they can't take away from you
[38:54] the baptism in the name of the Lord
[38:56] Jesus Christ if it's revealed to you if
[38:59] not you'll drop it and run off and take
[39:02] something out something but if it's
[39:05] revealed they can't do it cause why
[39:09] because you become the interpretation if
[39:15] we believe in one true and living God if
[39:22] we believe that we are the children of
[39:26] God
[39:29] then we're the interpretation
[39:38] now think about it the interpretation of
[39:43] the word you don't think like that
[39:51] well no we we can't interpret it go
[39:55] ahead
[39:56] play your silly games you're not
[40:00] listening or thinking this message
[40:05] brought alive the God that I believed in
[40:14] sure I couldn't explain it sure I didn't
[40:17] know how sure I was just as much
[40:19] carnality and in all like that an
[40:21] understanding is mankind could be what
[40:24] takes one thing about it this message is
[40:27] brought Christ to me what's it done to
[40:29] you I'm telling this message we said
[40:33] well the Bible brought me to Christ
[40:36] yeah brother used to tell me say well
[40:42] you know I've got to see God in me he's
[40:50] before I could see God in Jesus I said
[40:53] you're exactly backwards I said that's
[40:59] totally backwards listen you got to see
[41:02] God in Christ and then and only then can
[41:08] it be revealed that he's in you because
[41:14] what's in you is not Christ then if it's
[41:19] not revealed it's not Christ I mean you
[41:21] can quote all you want to Christ in you
[41:23] the hope of glory nice letters on the
[41:25] page I quoted that as a Trinitarian once
[41:29] you quote well you just see there I know
[41:37] but what about a an understanding that
[41:41] would label it down and bring it to a
[41:44] purity in our hearts and our lives until
[41:48] the gates of Hell cannot prevail against
[41:53] it now that's that's what I'm talking
[42:01] about because that's what Jesus said it
[42:05] would right he said upon this rock I'll
[42:08] build my church and the gates of hell he
[42:10] said can't prevail against it now he
[42:13] said they'll be against it
[42:16] but they can't overcome it in other
[42:22] words if they took your Bible away from
[42:24] you you know just took their Bibles away
[42:28] some way they could make them all
[42:31] disappear
[42:33] what would you do
[42:41] could you live off of what you've got in
[42:43] your heart or would you still try to
[42:47] find some letter from what I'm talking
[42:54] about writing of the Bible or a Bible
[42:58] that is written that man can read now
[43:03] listen to what I'm getting at so it's
[43:07] impossible no think it's impossible to
[43:12] read the letter of the word
[43:17] and keep it correct no okay you're not
[43:24] listening it's impossible to read the
[43:28] letter of the word and keep it straight
[43:35] but now with Christ in you then the
[43:41] letter you see that it doesn't need
[43:43] anything to make it straight it's
[43:45] automatically straight it's real so
[43:48] you're getting what I'm talking about
[43:52] well brother Dale I've got to have the
[43:55] work that's right a man but what if they
[43:57] take all that away from you in other
[44:05] words if they took her Bibles and things
[44:06] away wouldn't it be able to persuade us
[44:09] to go back where we came from and
[44:12] believe what we used to believe
[44:19] mm a little more to it than what we
[44:23] think all right whatever son and
[44:28] daughter of God of this age is the
[44:33] interpretation
[44:35] of the word that's why you can't be
[44:43] taken from you see the gates of Hell
[44:45] can't prevail no so then when we brought
[44:54] that point in the last message we were
[44:57] sitting at revelations one one and one
[45:00] through three and coming forth and
[45:03] trying to get a picture into our minds
[45:08] and what was it the Prophet said there
[45:14] he said God said before I cover anything
[45:24] you remember that quote before I cover
[45:27] anything about this or whatever he said
[45:29] I want you to know who I am
[45:34] ain't that something before I tell you
[45:40] about any of these things I want you to
[45:43] know who I am
[45:45] ah
[45:56] now then too if we take another step and
[46:00] we look at the Book of Revelations that
[46:03] it starts off we'll get back to these in
[46:06] another message or so but looking at the
[46:14] revelation of God's Word and knowing
[46:20] that if the Prophet is right you say
[46:25] well no you've been saying all this time
[46:27] and he was right I okay I'm laying that
[46:29] back in your lap I'm not so don't worry
[46:32] about it i doesn't made my emphasis I
[46:34] don't care what they would come up with
[46:37] and prove that brother Branham was this
[46:39] or that or the other been married 49
[46:41] times and all this that in the other
[46:44] there's no way to take away the
[46:48] revelation from my heart and if there is
[46:55] a way to take it away from your heart
[46:57] then it's not in your heart
[46:59] it's letters on the page you're still
[47:02] arguing you still fussing about things
[47:05] you know this way I am I just make it
[47:07] plain let's say this is that
[47:11] I don't worry about it but he said now
[47:16] before I tell you about these things of
[47:23] The Book of Revelations he said I want
[47:26] you to know who I am
[47:29] now you remember how we kept emphasizing
[47:31] that because only by knowing who he was
[47:39] could we believe the truth of romaine
[47:41] truth alright and by him explaining
[47:48] remember what we went through explained
[47:51] who he was who was he he was one true
[47:54] and the greatest revelation the prophet
[47:56] said of all things is to see who this
[47:59] Jesus Christ really is alright but just
[48:09] remember this point he starts out
[48:13] showing who he is
[48:24] then he starts showing who you are I
[48:28] mean talking about God now income you
[48:31] know the profit is when it brought this
[48:33] to where we have the understanding I'm
[48:34] talking about God in His Word God and
[48:41] His Word said I want you to know who I
[48:43] am I'm the Alpha and the Omega I'm the
[48:45] beginning of the end
[48:46] I'm the which was and she'll come we
[48:50] went through that in a message
[48:55] what you see when you see as I said the
[49:01] brother said I can only see in myself so
[49:05] no you can't see it in yourself first I
[49:08] said I understand your point you your
[49:11] thought is good but it you don't see it
[49:12] that way brother I said you got to see
[49:15] him in you've got to see Oh God and
[49:17] Christ then you can see Christ in the
[49:21] church uh-huh so he starts off in
[49:26] Revelations to show who he is before he
[49:31] starts declaring anything to the ages
[49:37] though he's shortening he's the almighty
[49:39] the Alpha and Omega the beginning in he
[49:41] he's the one true and living God uh-huh
[49:47] but see then it has to come to a place
[49:50] that when we see who we are
[50:04] now I'm going to make the statement and
[50:05] I'm going to mean it straight the only
[50:08] way the gates of Hell cannot prevail
[50:10] against this message is for you to
[50:12] realize this message is alive in you
[50:16] that's as blunt as I can put it see
[50:22] anybody out there you realize that
[50:23] that's what I've I've got everything I
[50:25] think got no eggs and no other baskets
[50:27] you know as we call it ain't got nothing
[50:29] left over just in case this don't work
[50:31] everything I've got is based upon this
[50:35] Word of God
[50:36] I always have been I always just been
[50:40] that away it's always based upon the
[50:43] Word of God ain't saying I understand
[50:46] all of it I didn't say that I said what
[50:49] I understand you can't take away he's
[50:58] like a brother big brother came to the
[51:00] house one time and he's sitting on the
[51:02] porch talking and and he said God is
[51:08] known in the number for his life what
[51:17] are you getting at well the number for
[51:20] his life I said no now you're off just a
[51:23] little bit hold it I said according to
[51:27] the prophet the number three is life
[51:32] unless said then you take justice ain't
[51:34] occasion to baptism in the Holy Ghost
[51:36] you got life I said now according to the
[51:40] same prophet he takes it to the number
[51:42] four as justification same case the
[51:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the word I
[51:48] don't know but I said you're making your
[51:51] wrong statement so that's where
[51:54] d'arbonne stopping you from saying what
[51:57] you're saying because you're making it
[51:59] wrong
[51:59] see if I leave you with a thought that
[52:03] you think that I believe that the number
[52:06] four I said I'm not with all these other
[52:09] guys that run around saying fours an
[52:11] antichrist number not the Prophet said
[52:13] it was
[52:16] but then he's was the one that said it
[52:19] was the number of restoration so then we
[52:24] got to get down to that season that's
[52:30] how easy it can be to slide something in
[52:35] you know God's number four then in this
[52:40] other guy come on so we're gonna on
[52:41] God's numbers satan's numbers for but
[52:45] you just put it back straight say well
[52:46] you put it on number three as being the
[52:48] number of life and then we'll go on from
[52:51] that with the word right because see
[52:56] that way then I'm looking for something
[52:59] more to be there in the Bible than to
[53:03] just be now listen
[53:06] justification sanctification the baptism
[53:10] the old ago there's more to it
[53:16] praise God for that point or thought but
[53:19] there's more to the story
[53:22] all right so name starts off and he says
[53:27] before I tell you anything I want you to
[53:31] know who I am now could we pick up from
[53:37] that thought for just a moment forgive
[53:41] me and to bring it to the basis that
[53:51] we've got to realize who he is all right
[53:56] but then if you don't realize who you
[53:59] are who you are because that's the
[54:08] important part is seeing who you are all
[54:12] right so he starts off just keep these
[54:16] notes because I'm having it I'm cutting
[54:18] the message I'm gonna take the rest of
[54:20] it later Sunday but to realize who he is
[54:29] then it's to realize of what he has made
[54:32] us we're not nothing we're not worthy of
[54:36] anything that's all we won't worry about
[54:38] that don't get concerned with brother
[54:40] Dale's trying to make us something I'm
[54:42] trying to make us what the Bible says we
[54:44] are we just read that the Prophet said
[54:48] every son and daughter of God was the
[54:50] word of God interpreted right all right
[54:59] then to see who he is
[55:03] gets it started in the right direction
[55:07] but now if the Book of Revelations don't
[55:10] reveal who we are
[55:14] then we missed the whole story so what
[55:20] does he immediately start off with as I
[55:24] said he said okay now for you doing I
[55:26] want you to know who I am so he said
[55:27] okay I'm the Alpha and Omega the
[55:29] beginning in the end and he which was
[55:31] all of these times he's bringing it down
[55:33] and but then he stops not stops
[55:43] revealing who he is and what's going on
[55:45] he stops and I don't guess you call it
[55:50] changes course because then he starts
[55:54] talking about the bride so now to
[56:03] realise who he is is wonderful that's
[56:05] got to be that statement but to realize
[56:10] what he has made us is that the
[56:12] scripture is he that has made us not we
[56:14] ourselves who are his people the Sheep
[56:16] of his pasture right then before he
[56:22] starts explaining the times in the doing
[56:26] he said I want you to know who I am so
[56:28] he defines who is he covers who is the
[56:32] Alpha the Omega he's one true and living
[56:34] God the revelation of Jesus Christ the
[56:37] entire Bible unveiling there in human
[56:40] flesh
[56:44] but then it looks hard to what he does
[56:50] he takes it from the basis of explaining
[56:55] who he is and he starts explaining who
[56:59] you are
[57:06] come on brothers feet pull it up and
[57:10] I'll get it to going go ahead to
[57:15] revelations 1 verse 9 we read a little
[57:22] bit while you're getting there but we
[57:23] need that scripture I didn't think about
[57:25] going this way so alright verse 9 and I
[57:29] John who also am your brother and
[57:32] companion in tribulation and Kingdom of
[57:34] the patience of the saints which was on
[57:37] the Isle of Patmos for the word of God
[57:39] and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I
[57:43] was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and
[57:46] heard behind me a great voice as of a
[57:51] trumpet know that voice speaks and says
[57:57] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first in
[58:01] the list and what they'll see us write
[58:03] in the book and send it unto the seven
[58:05] churches which are in Asia Ephesus
[58:07] Smyrna Pergamum
[58:10] now Tyra Sardis Philadelphia lady Oh
[58:15] seal I look and I turned to see the
[58:19] voice I turned to see the voice now John
[58:33] on earth remember the point now I want
[58:40] you to know who I am John on earth had
[58:43] walked and associated with this man that
[58:47] is now speaking because there's a
[58:50] red-letter who speaking so it's got to
[58:53] be Jesus Christ now we'll get back on
[58:54] these other things well don't don't get
[58:56] so much jumpy fight and running about
[58:58] about this and know that was this when
[59:00] that was brother branham that was this
[59:02] wouldn't it just leave all that alone
[59:03] for a while and just go with it some
[59:06] think it's lame it plainly tells you who
[59:10] this is it plainly tells you here what's
[59:15] taking place but it plainly tells you
[59:19] what he wants you to understand
[59:21] so they hadn't got that up revelations
[59:24] brother okay I got a couple of trainees
[59:28] somebody flopped a thing and bring up
[59:30] revelations revelations one okay we got
[59:35] it now
[59:36] so look what he says I John who also am
[59:41] your brother and companion in
[59:43] tribulation in the kingdom of patience
[59:44] of Jesus Christ was in the isle that is
[59:46] called Patmos for the word of God on the
[59:49] testimonies he and it was in his spirit
[59:51] on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a
[59:53] great voice as of a trumpet
[59:59] he turns to see the voice he knows who's
[1:00:09] talking that's the emphasis I want you
[1:00:13] to think about for a minute he knows
[1:00:16] who's talking this is not a surprised
[1:00:19] voice or some hidden vain john knows who
[1:00:24] this is
[1:00:26] he knows the voice from when he was on
[1:00:29] earth with him and he turns to see the
[1:00:35] voice he doesn't turn to see the person
[1:00:38] brother Brennan said because he knew who
[1:00:40] the person was now I got this will pick
[1:00:43] it up Sunday because I know we won't get
[1:00:45] it tonight so just bear with me but look
[1:00:49] what he said I was in the spirit on the
[1:00:51] Lord's Day and heard behind me a great
[1:00:52] voice as of a trumpet saying the trumpet
[1:00:56] is saying the voice that I'm Alpha and
[1:01:00] Omega the first and the last and what
[1:01:03] that see us writing a book I'm sending
[1:01:04] them to the seven sir all right who is
[1:01:06] this speaking the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:10] right all right and I turned to see the
[1:01:15] voice that spake with me and being
[1:01:18] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[1:01:24] he knows the voice that's the point
[1:01:28] he knows the voice or who the voice is
[1:01:31] he knows that's the voice of the Lord
[1:01:34] Jesus because he said I'm the Alpha
[1:01:37] under amigo I'm though he knows that
[1:01:41] voice but he turns to see the voice not
[1:01:48] to person he was expecting in other
[1:01:52] words to see the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:01:53] he saw him but what did he see him as
[1:02:01] come on what he seemed that and I turned
[1:02:05] to see the voice that spake with me and
[1:02:07] being turned I saw seven golden
[1:02:08] candlesticks in the midst of the seven
[1:02:12] candlesticks one like unto the Son of
[1:02:15] Man clothed with a garment down to the
[1:02:18] foot and Girt about the paps with a
[1:02:19] golden girdle now what do you see he saw
[1:02:26] seven golden candlesticks we know who
[1:02:29] that is and what is to be in to be the
[1:02:31] church ages and the things but when he
[1:02:35] turns he's not lost in other word is not
[1:02:39] surprised to turn around
[1:02:42] because he knew what he was going to see
[1:02:45] but the surprise was what he saw he
[1:02:49] never saw the Lord Jesus Christ standing
[1:02:52] there in physical form
[1:02:55] he saw the form that he wanted a man to
[1:02:59] know now here's the point before we go
[1:03:02] any further he says John I want you to
[1:03:06] know who I am
[1:03:09] they need to describe who he is and then
[1:03:15] a voice speaks and he turns to hear our
[1:03:19] to face that direction
[1:03:24] he sees um let's see what would have
[1:03:28] called it he sees the secondary work
[1:03:32] maybe wrong way of expressing it but in
[1:03:35] other words what he saw was the Lord
[1:03:38] Jesus Christ but he saw it as the son of
[1:03:47] man standing in the seven golden
[1:03:50] candlesticks that's what he did he's
[1:03:56] turned to say brother I don't see it
[1:03:59] I'll give you these Sunday well just lay
[1:04:02] it down I'll read it Sunday he said he
[1:04:04] saw a bride well because he saw one like
[1:04:12] unto the Son of Man it doesn't say saw
[1:04:14] the Son of man standing it it's one like
[1:04:16] unto the Son of Man same things that
[1:04:18] were in Daniel Daniel sees in when it
[1:04:20] comes to him it's one lakh under the Son
[1:04:22] of Man when you're using the word like
[1:04:26] under the son of man you're meaning that
[1:04:28] it is a point that you're trying to see
[1:04:31] is God in another form being revealed so
[1:04:37] before we go any farther John says our
[1:04:39] God says to John I want you to know who
[1:04:41] I am then when he finishes up describing
[1:04:47] who he is
[1:04:50] he said now I want you to know who you
[1:04:52] are right because he turns and sees one
[1:05:00] standing in the midst of the seven
[1:05:01] golden candlesticks he saw the Lord
[1:05:06] Jesus Christ in His Church saw him
[1:05:14] standing in his church one lakh unto the
[1:05:19] Son of man who was the son of man when
[1:05:23] he was on earth the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:27] who demands say I the Son of man I am
[1:05:31] I'm the Alpha and Omega the beginning
[1:05:34] and the end I'm now all of that
[1:05:35] my name is Jesus cuz that's who he was
[1:05:39] the Son of Man all right now he says
[1:05:45] before I tell you anything about these
[1:05:48] ages
[1:05:51] in the things of time and life and what
[1:05:55] takes place I want you to know I don't
[1:06:00] know who you are I know who you are and
[1:06:06] I put you in the correct position
[1:06:11] because he said I know you won't try to
[1:06:14] take my place you won't try to do
[1:06:18] anything like that that you'll realize
[1:06:23] who you are because of what I've done
[1:06:27] right if the Alpha and Omega the
[1:06:33] beginning and the end is he's a god all
[1:06:35] and all then when he sees him in bride
[1:06:40] form
[1:06:44] are you listening just listen to a point
[1:06:48] John before we go any further and to
[1:06:51] tell you anything about these ages I
[1:06:54] want you to see who I am and he
[1:07:00] describes himself too John
[1:07:05] when it was which is you'll come all of
[1:07:08] the Alpha Namita being now what does he
[1:07:11] say now before we go any further I want
[1:07:15] you to see who you are because John was
[1:07:22] put dark too right and bring to the ages
[1:07:25] what he saw now throughout the seven
[1:07:32] church ages now right there spout
[1:07:35] throughout the seven church ages
[1:07:39] not just the first age and not just the
[1:07:41] life stage it's going to take seven
[1:07:44] Church ages to bring into manifestation
[1:07:49] the seven golden candlesticks is that
[1:07:52] sensible and the names only gives the
[1:07:55] ages and all the things
[1:07:58] all right but one age can't do it you
[1:08:06] came sex just this life stage oh look at
[1:08:08] what we are here amen we'll look at what
[1:08:11] we are amen I agree but we're not all of
[1:08:14] it because he's going to reveal what
[1:08:22] he's going to do in seven Church ages
[1:08:29] he's going to come on the scene to
[1:08:31] manifest himself now get this I said
[1:08:36] I'll read this any more
[1:08:41] see Jesus himself when he was here in
[1:08:44] flesh he didn't know when he was going
[1:08:48] to come but the Prophet says now after
[1:08:52] he comes to Patmos said he knows he said
[1:08:58] he knows all right he's gonna describe
[1:09:01] how he's gonna come come on raise your
[1:09:06] scripture he said I don't know when I'm
[1:09:08] coming said only the Father Knows
[1:09:15] but when he comes to Patmos he knows but
[1:09:21] he knows how he gets there he gets there
[1:09:27] through a group of people when are we
[1:09:34] gonna realize church that the Bible and
[1:09:36] the things as I said there's not letters
[1:09:39] on the page it's a revelation of
[1:09:44] Almighty God to mankind and he cannot
[1:09:53] reveal himself now listen he cannot
[1:09:59] reveal himself without showing that you
[1:10:03] are part of him that's the secret of it
[1:10:07] all that's the hope of all Christianity
[1:10:10] that's that's everything that should be
[1:10:13] in any of our hearts and lives is to
[1:10:15] know and realize that without him were
[1:10:21] nothing okay we got better what if you
[1:10:28] know without us I like go brother Theo
[1:10:33] the way he brought it a number of years
[1:10:35] ago and he was talking about Jesus and
[1:10:39] brother Theo Erasmus from Africa and he
[1:10:44] said now you just take it said his name
[1:10:46] is j esus
[1:10:49] and he said now if you take us out of it
[1:10:53] which is us
[1:10:55] he said his name is Jess he said thank
[1:10:59] complete so thereby you gotta have the
[1:11:05] word Jesus you see he come to make
[1:11:14] himself known yes God came down to
[1:11:19] mankind to make yourself known to reveal
[1:11:21] himself to mankind he didn't just pick
[1:11:27] up a people or grab some kind of
[1:11:32] something and throw it in and make a
[1:11:33] story right the story was written before
[1:11:42] the foundation of the world so if he's
[1:11:48] in the midst of the seven golden
[1:11:49] candlesticks he's in his bride bride
[1:11:58] form so he cannot be made and I'm
[1:12:03] quoting brother Branham now he said he's
[1:12:05] not complete without us he won all of
[1:12:09] those quotes you know if I quoted it's
[1:12:11] laying there somewhere might take a
[1:12:13] while to honey but be glad to yeah he's
[1:12:19] not complete without us now it's not the
[1:12:23] fact of how good we are or what he needs
[1:12:26] of us to fulfill those things it's what
[1:12:29] he said that's why I emphasize it well
[1:12:37] ago when he turned to see the voice he
[1:12:43] knew that voice he knew who that was
[1:12:51] but the surprise was where he was seen
[1:12:54] that vultures
[1:13:02] great man one day riding down a road on
[1:13:04] a horse going to kill Christians he
[1:13:10] struck down in the middle of the day by
[1:13:11] a great blinding light he knows now come
[1:13:21] on you never thought would run around
[1:13:24] him or what he saying how did Paul know
[1:13:28] about Jesus in everything to do with it
[1:13:34] but what did he say he said he knew that
[1:13:41] that pillar of fire right was the
[1:13:46] Jehovah of the old all he needed was the
[1:13:53] statement to be made I'm Jesus and their
[1:14:03] persecutors struck a man blind struck
[1:14:10] him - worth it he winds up wanting to
[1:14:15] give his life for that one that had come
[1:14:19] to him Paul saw who that was
[1:14:30] Gudrun said he would never a call that
[1:14:32] pillar of our Lord
[1:14:35] but now the surprise was was when the
[1:14:38] voice spoke back see Paul had never
[1:14:43] heard that voice so he ain't like John
[1:14:46] that would have know the voice you get
[1:14:48] to MphasiS well ago John knew the voice
[1:14:51] he knew that was that he was going to
[1:14:54] turn to see the surprise was just what
[1:14:57] he saw when he turned to see he seen a
[1:14:59] bride standing in the candles - what
[1:15:03] about Paul Paul sees a pillar of fire
[1:15:09] what couldn't Satan impersonate a pillar
[1:15:11] of fire and everything look
[1:15:16] why did Paul call him Lord the only
[1:15:27] thing he had was a pillar of fire right
[1:15:39] but he said Lord little Ron said he knew
[1:15:44] that that pillar of fire was a Jehovah
[1:15:48] the Old Testament Almighty God he never
[1:15:55] could hear the voice so that didn't work
[1:15:57] he didn't have what John had so it
[1:16:01] wouldn't work but when that voice did
[1:16:07] speak he had to define who it was he
[1:16:13] didn't say I was Jehovah the Old
[1:16:15] Testament I was there said no what did
[1:16:16] he say he said I'm Jesus whom thou
[1:16:22] persecuted now listen for a minute you
[1:16:27] don't think this way how would that
[1:16:29] prophet know what would be the key why
[1:16:33] was it not that Paul could have got
[1:16:37] mixed up in seeing a pillar of fire
[1:16:42] don't you believe Satan can impersonate
[1:16:44] all those thing there's got to be more
[1:16:47] to the story
[1:16:56] so when the voice spoke then only who it
[1:17:03] was
[1:17:05] he said I'm Jesus and our persecutors
[1:17:13] now listen
[1:17:15] Paul knew for certain who he is
[1:17:17] persecuting right now you agree with me
[1:17:21] are you listening Paul knew who he was
[1:17:23] persecuting he wasn't persecuting no
[1:17:26] Romans he wouldn't persecute and no it's
[1:17:29] my lights and highlights and Jebusites
[1:17:31] and whatever eyes he knew who he was
[1:17:35] persecuting by now he had given his
[1:17:40] consent to death
[1:17:42] Ben dar was seeing Stephan stoned and
[1:17:48] Stephan looks up and he said Father
[1:17:54] forgive them he said they don't know
[1:17:58] what they're doing Paul heard him as he
[1:18:04] was describing that I see Jesus it
[1:18:11] begins to dawn on Paul about that time
[1:18:17] that should Jehovah the old would have
[1:18:22] to be Jesus of the new he come to a
[1:18:30] point of realization what was taking
[1:18:32] place that he had been killing
[1:18:39] Christians he had been persecuting those
[1:18:43] who claimed the name of Jesus do you get
[1:18:49] what I'm saying
[1:18:50] how did he know that pillar of fire was
[1:18:54] real why would it be that he would not
[1:18:58] be able to know I mean you know how did
[1:19:04] he know
[1:19:10] because when that pillar fire begin to
[1:19:12] talk back he knew that was all Paul or
[1:19:23] Saul you know what is that why
[1:19:26] persecutest thou me he said who are you
[1:19:29] lord right
[1:19:34] Paul still all mister he got the new
[1:19:36] birth yet come on that's not all still
[1:19:40] laying there on the ground rolling
[1:19:41] around
[1:19:45] he said I'm Jesus now put it this way he
[1:19:54] said Paul you understand the Jehovah the
[1:20:00] old listen now I want you to know that's
[1:20:04] who's talking to you
[1:20:07] are you listening a pillar of fire could
[1:20:13] be impersonated but when that pillar of
[1:20:19] fire spoke back to something that Paul
[1:20:22] was doing he was killing those that had
[1:20:33] the interpretation of the word of God he
[1:20:39] was killing the Christians so it would
[1:20:48] just looking at a pillar of fire it was
[1:20:52] what to pull her far say it if that
[1:20:56] pillar fire never said anything he would
[1:20:58] have never caught on but when that
[1:21:05] pillar of fire spoke back and said I'm
[1:21:07] Jesus whom thou persecutors
[1:21:15] it's hard for thee to kick against the
[1:21:16] pricks you know I've heard everybody
[1:21:19] explain that and I'm not different with
[1:21:20] nobody but it's never been I never got
[1:21:23] the right understanding to that why
[1:21:27] would he say it that it was hard for
[1:21:28] thee to kick against to prick
[1:21:32] I've heard definitions have ever formed
[1:21:35] but you know the one definition I like
[1:21:37] is what I think even though the Apostle
[1:21:41] Paul was a man that went out there and
[1:21:44] killed the Christians but yet he kept
[1:21:49] that law to the letter he fathered that
[1:21:58] law to the letter and he knew that he
[1:22:04] ought not be doing those thing because
[1:22:11] he could follow that law back there
[1:22:13] don't you think Paul would think about
[1:22:16] it I'm out here kill it killing these
[1:22:18] people and they're crying out about
[1:22:21] Jesus I never met him never seen him
[1:22:24] never heard him for each I said there's
[1:22:28] one thing about it what I've always
[1:22:35] believed to be the pillar of fire God
[1:22:38] himself he says now stands before me and
[1:22:47] I must accept it as ever done you that
[1:22:51] way come on musicians never done that to
[1:22:54] you we'll get the thoughts will read it
[1:22:58] from more on it just been taking on this
[1:23:01] for about two or three weeks Paul knew
[1:23:10] that was great Jehovah
[1:23:17] in you that was but not because it was
[1:23:23] just a pillar of fire but because that
[1:23:26] pillar of fire spoke and that pillar of
[1:23:33] fire spoke according to the word back on
[1:23:40] these things what does it mean to be a
[1:23:42] living Bible what you think Paul looking
[1:23:48] down there and seeing that because
[1:23:49] brother around and said he wound up
[1:23:51] saying I want to die he could have got
[1:23:55] by even God warned him told him not to
[1:23:57] go certain ways you know the scripture
[1:23:59] but he said I thing what did he die I
[1:24:01] want to die because I've persecuted
[1:24:06] Jesus Christ I want to die for the cause
[1:24:13] ain't worthy to live see God kept him
[1:24:19] alive for all the time he needed him
[1:24:21] then Satan stepped in right took his
[1:24:24] life
[1:24:26] listen but he never forgot I'm quoting
[1:24:34] brother Branham perforated he never
[1:24:37] forgot the day that he would hold in
[1:24:39] that coat for them to kill Stephen he
[1:24:45] never forgot that
[1:24:51] well I'm because
[1:24:54] he saw who Jesus really is what about oh
[1:24:57] we got brothers you seemed a little like
[1:25:00] on these times
[1:25:01] Oh greater is He that is in Cain greater
[1:25:09] is He that is in me
[1:25:13] it's primarily that is in me would you
[1:25:17] know before he that's in did you know
[1:25:23] the voice of God in
[1:25:26] greater is He that is in me why do you
[1:25:31] put all your headers everything all that
[1:25:33] is in me than he that's in the world and
[1:25:39] maybe for shade and like Aurora what do
[1:25:46] you put it out in the church all right
[1:25:49] seeing whom he may devour the Bible
[1:25:55] tells the coalition to go over the old
[1:25:58] if Jesus many souls have been his prey
[1:26:02] before I can say anything about the ages
[1:26:06] or express what I say about his promise
[1:26:10] I want you to know de Lions overcome and
[1:26:14] power
[1:26:16] we send in grater and I will tell Hill
[1:26:19] you are me greater is He that is in me
[1:26:24] Oh from it all true me paddle you that
[1:26:28] is in me than he that's in
[1:26:32] oh they did the mess to the seven golden
[1:26:35] candlesticks a day of Pentecost
[1:26:39] you can't leave anybody will it blew
[1:26:44] into the oldies Jesus Christ the same
[1:26:47] yesterday today and forever anybody
