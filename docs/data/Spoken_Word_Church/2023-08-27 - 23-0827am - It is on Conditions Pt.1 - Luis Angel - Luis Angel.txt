heart in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I mean amen amen amen God bless you all you may be seated and is the commentary present Army before we continue with the message I'd like to just quickly present myself uh brother Wade has already mentioned my name my name is a country that's located in South America is we're preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ a northern part of the capital of of Peru which is Lima and we've been there working about 25 years we've been working in the mission fields and for years as well we've helped also translate the further Brandon's message into Spanish you know that that work hasn't really ended yet it hasn't ended there's still a lot to correct within those messages do you know that there's not 100 percent good translations but we have I said do all that we can material to be able to transmit the character of God's spirit that he left in those messages and it's a very delicate we continue to look over each one of those translations that he would continue to help us in that work the human ways don't really they're not really worth worth it you know compared to Eternal things I'm dedicating myself full time to what to the word of God [Music] he would just provide for each one of us let us continue English in the scriptures that we just read we look at a very important declaration here Pablo Paul esta La personas he's telling the people there in Corinthians the Corinthians the reason why he has changed his decision why he's of his visit you know the people in Corinthians they were up here spiritually so just apparently they seem like they were up here we'll stay at seven you know brother Brandon said that the message that he preached they said it's the same message that Paul preached it's a mean woman it says the same one many people don't identify that it's the exact message because they don't they don't understand what's written in this old book said how many have read all the Bible the whole Bible good muy bien great it's wonderful you know I I haven't received that feedback there's places where Nobody Has Lifted their hand no one wow and not even the pasture that's incredible it's very incredible elements I've had the opportunity to travel other countries Spanish-speaking countries and also English-speaking countries and I've had the opportunity they're starting services to be in question and answer services for ministers and this question always comes up if you are not sure the Holy Spirit [Music] um supposedly that knows and reads and that he had that he has the holy ghosts you remember that faith comes by here and in here and by the word of God it's something that's very incredible America they're not just in Latin America but even here in the United States we receive those types of testimonies it's time to get serious and we have people out here walking on four legs they're saying that they call it they're saying that they're horses literally he's meaning literally it's out here in America in another place it's incredible amen in California many of these things they come from California La marijuana marijuana and these the things with the with the uh um about the gender yeah gender yeah comes from out west California and do you know what's happening in California California in the last 10 years acresido has grown in this the the the the the uneducated uh the uneducated have has grown in California people in California don't read so where did you get those statistics they're in your statistics the ones who sell uh books in California they don't sell as much books in California dinero not because the people don't have money they have a lot of money but they don't know how to read and because they don't know how to read no laying they don't read and because they don't read we have all those things that are coming from there and you know where a lot of the strange things in the message come from people that don't know don't don't read the word amen the Bible condemns polygamy foreign for example is doodle it's difficult it's something difficult to say and to recognize but it's time for us to confront those things we're about 60 years since the seals have been opened we're supposed to be walking in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we're supposed to be walking in eternity it's finished 60 years and we still have those things happening amongst us bringing stumbling blocks you know amongst the camp we have to go through the filter of the word there are many people today that baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's true we're not the only ones in James it says do you believe that God is the same thing the thing is they they can't live the word we are called to live the world man the the spoken word does not gossip the spoken word does not fornicate doesn't commit adultery the spoken word will never deny the word in this verse he's telling us that if it's true he has changed his decision to not visit Corinthians but it brings us a reality that the promises of God are in Jesus Christ see yay he fulfilled all the conditions that he made so that the work could be fulfilled you know God has made given us promises but we need to unite the conditions that he has made not that church has made or that the pastors have made he has made the conditions Jesus United all the conditions he came to be the word made flesh all the promises of God were fulfilled so we can say Amen to those but that's only if you know what those promises are are in in Jesus it's very important to know the scriptures we're not going to understand the message there's a brother a couple of years ago he left this message and he he did an interview on on a Portuguese television uh Network and he said okay that he had not made had the opportunity to study the word because of the messages fault and this is the message the voice of the sign look what he says the Bible says the Bible says I don't know how you can say that you can use that as an excuse that's studying the message and it prevents you from studying the Bible because the same propheti says the Bible says when brother Brandon breaks the Seven Seals contrary to description even if the angel himself told them because for him it was important that all his ministries were they scriptural amen is I've been speaking to other brothers uh older brothers in the message brothers from the first days for the first times when the message was introduced and you know I'm not I'm not old I'm not that old is and I thought that all of this was just a garden of Eternity [Laughter] pero but okay India but you see all those things that we see nowadays song espiritus they're just Spirits Spirits don't die the person to the other one generation to the other so that that doesn't touch us remember the church needs to Be watchful not just the pastor the church all of us you you you the pastor watches over you you watch over the pasture amen the prophet of God says that when the word when the when man leaves the word when man leaves the word you just leave the man is that correct because when you leave the word that's the reason why all these things strange things that we see coming up you know fornication isn't necessarily the physical act you first have to corrupt the word you first had to corrupt the truth when you corrupt the truth about them Romans then you see the the that's the fruits of that that's right you leave your your pizza to pizza to pizza your Pizza Company you leave your pizza outside okay if you leave a pizza or a piece of food outside the thing exposed to to the elements it's going to start corrupting yeah if you need to keep it you need to put it in the refrigerator you know if you need to keep it longer this is the Fountain of Life this is going to Keep Us Alive and while you're covered more and more with the word you're going to be able to prevent more and more of these things more and more of these attacks you know in the days of Jesus the people were forgetting or forgot what was going to happen what they had at that time was their own interpretation or their own ideas because they had forgotten this you go to the Book of Judges how does the Book of Judges start the people in that day did what was good in their eyes the ones who have read the Book of Judges know what that says just as if there was no word just as if they were no they were not Israelites they worshiped the gods of other nations but they were now worshiping the true Living God they knew about Baal they knew about astronauts they knew all about the other gods they did not know about the true Living God and in the Book of Judges chapter 19 verses 20 and 21. you know what happened there some some are looking or shaking their head some are not sure the benjamites Casio foreign because of fornication they raped a woman almost killing her right and do you know how that happened the Levi or the husband of that woman she he cut her up in pieces and sent the pieces each one of the leaders of the tribes of Israel the leaders of the tribe said have we seen something like that happened before and do you know what they did he said we're just gonna go they said that we're gonna just gonna kill them all all right and they had to eradicate evil we're not going to kill anybody nowadays we should describe the situations you know many people they confuse you describing the situation with speaking badly but understand one thing is to speak badly but it's another thing is to describe the situation and it's what Paul is teaching us Paul gives names he speaks of certain things that had happened telling the people the personas of people of things that are happening in their midst so that they would not be deceived you know it doesn't it doesn't deal with it's not about well it's your problem so you move on with that say something have you have you read that or have you seen that is and sometimes we just stay quiet about things in the message let's continue are we still okay um we're gonna read a couple of quotes here in the message influence and preached in January 12 1963. you know for me it's important for me to say that is I've heard many people say that brother Brown said and when you look back and see what supposedly brother Branham said yeah and it's not there so it's important that when you quote the prophet is a word where it's at because many false doctrines have risen because of supposed quotes of the prophet and look what it says here we're told in Revelation 10 that there will be a messenger in the last day I mean we'll gather up these little ends and we'll bring them together and then the mystery of God would be finished Revelations 10 7. at the sounding of this Angel which was a messenger of the Earth all that is history it's history Todo Los Cabos all of the all of the the Loose Ends have been have been taught together and the Mystery of God has been finished that you understand it that's another thing yeah or that has or that has been revealed to you that's a that's a different thing you know Revelations 10 1-7 that's the messenger right that's you and me and Don says so that has to come progressively amen Legos then then one came down from heaven with his hands up rainbow over his head and swore that there would be time no more an angel taken an oath and when we see this thing is materializing let us pause here for just a moment do you see the order he first he first uh spoke about the the terrestrial messenger or the illegal he speaks of the angel that descended from Heaven you and me know what the order of that is in the scriptures we're not going to initiate a new doctrine saying that this one comes first or this one comes second that's in in the in the preaching yeah sometimes people say oh well no this is the order of the scripture but no no no no no no but we have to we have to know the scriptures and we see how that works when all these see these things materialize in 1963 materialism when we see this thing materializing it's Historia that's that's history yes that has happened right it's materialized look what it says how sincere we should be how many are sincere of knowledge he said those all Promises of God are true but they're they're unconditioned one condition all every promise has its condition the Bible says that we're they were healed but it has a condition no matter how fundamentally right we are the names we've got to approach it in the right way we've got to approach it in the right way fundamentally now man can be fundamentally right and still not receive the blessings because it's approached in the wrong way it goes upon conditions we have to bring the conditions together seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things shall be added unto you we have to seek the kingdom of God you want to see the things of the word happen in your life surround yourself with the word surround yourself with the word El Domingo only just on Sunday only just on Wednesday oh Los alvados or just on Saturday and at night every time every day I was speaking to a pastor here one time North America from here from America and I was talking to him I was asking him why him and his people don't read the Bible and he told me well we just don't have time but they have Netflix app on their cell phone a small series there on Netflix see a small series there on Netflix how long does that last yeah [Laughter] the Deacon is looking at me so he's writing down writing things down the video side of Amazon and yet they don't have time we have people today that preach they'll go to the table app they'll say they'll think I'm going to talk about speak about love they'll put love in there and they'll find all the quotes about love search they'll decide on a few quotes and they'll look in the Bible in their in their app and they'll put love in there and they'll search they'll search they'll select a few scriptures there they'll put them on a word and that's the message and if you ask them something that's not in their notes they don't know if you ask him a little something more about more in depth about that scripture they just read they can't explain it to you God help us if I ask you about your Farms that you have here you're going to tell me Well a Gainesville over there is the capital is the chicken capital of the of the world and you're going to describe to me everything that's there even though you don't work there you know all about Gainesville what about the word we should know the word amen amen the word of God is not something that's antiquated is something that should be present yes it should be something present it should be future yeah amen even Paul says if an angel from heaven speak something even this contrary to this word that you should not hear it let it be a curse yeah I'm trying to soften things up a little bit check this pasta you know we've seen those that mistake before the word of God says that this word is it's in the book of Psalms is useful for the child for the young person and for the Elder I dedicated myself to read the scriptures with all the brethren in our church literally contotos with all of them none of them escaped there's a few Rebels there but in 2023 comments we started the year with more people that now knew the scriptures more services our services are different now the people they react towards what they they know because they know that do you know what an amen means it means that's correct let it be so nothing they know yeah I don't need to say well if you don't jump up you're not part of the bride of Christ we're not we're not professional animators the people react to the word if they don't react to the words because they're not in that same channel of the word and Paul didn't say that we're going to preach just because depending on the amens that you get we understand that the spirit of God works depending on your need it's true that is true but remember it's it it's a deep clemando Colin another deep respondent S I don't believe that I'm saying these things just because I want to yeah I believe maybe there was a need for that to say this you're reacting to that I don't know you humanly but he knows us some of this is off the cuff but he's the one who is the leader God help us and so all these things it takes us to this point all the promises of God is with us they're they're true our promises of God are true but their own condition S no matter how fundamentally right we are we've got to approach it in the right way all right we're going to continue a little further for example says for instance when Ahab and Jehoshaphat were together you know who Ahab was right the majority good job good brother good the pastor might be saying okay you're wearing me now brother no no no no no no no not about here he means like wait a second they don't know who Ahab was [Laughter] for instance when a heaven Jehoshaphat were together really belong to Israel Israel with the food that should be given to Israel fundamentals fundamentally Ahab was right yes and that's the reason 400 Hebrew prophets with one Accord we're prophesied go on up to raymith in other words it's ours okay all right but there was a condition so fundamentally they were right wasn't right himself he was a pagan he was a a a wicked one he was he was departed from the Lord episode and when this one little man stood up by the name of Micah the son of imla unavision and saw a vision now one now one man's Vision against 400 trained prophets but the man's Vision compared with the word we must be sure amen Brethren it's important that we know all these things all those details God help us God help us let's go to another quote real quick time is our worst enemy you know when when I need to teach in my church we give it you know more time but I understand the limitation here so later this afternoon we'll continue look what the prophet of God said in the message God keeps his word someone would say but that's from 1957. what's the problem with that no no no there's people that say oh from 63 on up and that's all no no no no it was called to his Commission in 1946. the angel tell them you know store the food where they go and look foreign you have over 1200 sermons some of you here have have lived many decades now in many years knowing this message corrector is that true is that true have you read all the messages right absolutely no no you are you are responding don't worry we have a great responsibility we have a great responsibility God will will will demand of us of all these things that we're saying the evil around and we're speaking against Spirits we're speaking against powers we're fighting against those things all the demons are against the bride right he is for us amen says Doctrine experience can't be based upon some experience excuse me Doctrine is based on God's word and God help us God help us let's just pause there for a moment and we will continue later this afternoon you pray for me that I would be able to bring these things together not that I'm not doing it well I want to be able to just give you as much as possible so that we could be blessed is and that's what God has called us to do amen so we need to do it right God bless you listen to our feet let's get the musicians to come Gloria yeah Jesus predicaba you know when Jesus preached Jesus in the days of in the days of Jesus the scripture tells us that he would teach the word foreign and you know many many North Americans think that salvation is by works so what their dollars can do yeah we need the holy spirit of God working through us that's what we need to focus on I have gold nor silver said Peter but but what I have I give people out here have to speak about what's going on in spoken word church yesterday today and forever by the way a song and uh I believe he believes
