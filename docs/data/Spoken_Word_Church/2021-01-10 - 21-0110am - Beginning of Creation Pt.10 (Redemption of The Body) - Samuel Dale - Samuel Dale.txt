to our hearts that we may walk in you in jesus name amen revelation 3 14 and until the angel of the church of the lady of sin is right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god okay let's go to 10 is five wait a minute i gotta get over i'm in one i don't know where everybody gets that i'm in one one and then there's that called it two you know doing but that's all right verse 16. well yeah here we go wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yeah though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more i'm glad of that aren't you because it wouldn't matter if we did know him in the flesh that's fine but now to knowing that the way that the scripture is talking about him in the new birth therefore if any man be in christ he is a new create creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of god who has reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit now we got remember we got another two we got one in romans to understand that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation you may be seated lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now i want to try if i can to back up and just run through real fights and bring this part that we're talking about uh to to end and then we'll pick up some things along the way that we'll try to go into maybe um adoption predestinations just some some points along the way to uh be able to follow you know the line that we're doing all right i hope you've enjoyed what i've been trying to bring because you know to me i believe it's the beginning of the creation all right this is message number 10 that we're bringing and it's the the beginning it's you know we we look at it as the beginning and that's what i say another day we read revelation 3 14. it's the beginning of the creation but it's that there it is in the end of the book all right so then we're looking at the beginning of the creation all the way to the beginning of the creation of a new creation because that's what i've been trying to drive at you to just for us to see we know that we talk about the new creation all right and we've we went through it we went through the part of trying to bring that god himself came into being or came into manifestation or has revealed himself you know unto the man that he would create not leaving him in a blind spot you know that he wouldn't be doing it but he he the man that he was going to create the he starts out revealing himself into that creation that's back there see it would be a new creation because there was never a creation like that god himself condescending to earth or making himself known to mankind god himself now in that that way we have the understanding that we couldn't have a trinity because how would we have a trinity and we'd have three gods and trying to manifest the things so we know it's not it's the one true and living god that he's trying to reveal himself to you and me are revealing himself back there to the man that he was going to bring into being all right then to genesis 1 26 man 27 there that is the man that he would bring into being which would be the spirit man or god dividing himself in his people all right that's the point i want you to make sure to follow god dividing himself into his people he's not just associating with us he's not just coming down to be with us you know he could do that with the animals and all the kind of things like that but he's coming down to dwell with us all right but not to dwell with us to dwell in us so remember we spent a lot of time on genesis 1 26 wade had a lot that is the spiritual creation or spirit man that was created but not created like coming into being that what but the god of glory is manifesting himself to where we can see him all right that's what he's wanting he's wanting us to see him all right then he's coming forth himself in you and me because that's the beginning of the creation of god all right is god himself manifesting himself to you and i to so that we can see it all right then we went from the 126 man to a spirit man a spiritual creation went down to a physical creation of a human body that adam in the garden standing there and i've got one here that brother around said there he stood said his feet was standing in the earth he had created him physically right he had created adam physically and said he was standing with his feet in the in the earth and said then god breathed the breath of eternal life into him all right and that's where that i don't believe that we follow that uh i've emphasized it over and over and over that the man that was created in genesis 1 26 and 27 was not a physical flesh man it was spirit man or spiritual being in other words it was god in another form dividing himself among his people that would be his offspring that would be the children of god that would would come forth and and eventually make manifest all right but then he he's there in the garden and he's lonely because he still has nothing to fellowship in the natural flesh man all right so he creates adam genesis 2 7 he creates adam makes him a spiritual you know makes him a a human being in a body 16 elements a body and he's he's there and then god takes that 126 man puts it into the 2-7 and makes him to be a living soul because like i said the prophet said he was standing there he had created him he had molded him he had fashioned him he made him to be standing there and there he stands with his feet in the earth and then god breathes into his nostrils and he begins to move and go and do all right what's he doing he's making him he's putting this this spiritual man this eternal spiritual man because it would have to be the eternal the 126th and 27th or putting it into human flesh which would be the flesh man all right but it would be a new creation okay remember now how we brought it adam was created first physically and you know what i'm talking about and then jesus christ followed that jesus christ was not the first creation in the physical being he was the first creation in the spiritual being because he was the spiritual being he was the one who was back there and coming forth all right but then he brings the man forth and there you see adam standing in the garden in a wonderful position that inside of that human being standing there was the eternal god he had breathed into his nostrils blasphemous names he said especially into adam and i don't think that we want to take that maybe that's a wrong way of saying it but i don't think that we want to believe that to be true i'm just serious i don't think that we want to believe what the prophet said in blasphemous names then he said he breathed into his nostrils and he became an eternal person with god amen there stood adam in the garden spirit eternal i mean uh soul eternal spirit and body still not eternal but yet it's there it's he put into that man that that human body that was standing there he put that what that he had in genesis 1 26 and 27 he put that into that and it made that and see we we don't want to take because we look at the fall we look we say but but but uh now but brother dale adam failed but before he failed he had an atonement right so everything was ready there wasn't nothing going to be out of place but that man that was standing there he's standing there just anchored in the earth because he was molded out of the earth or then god breathes into his nostrils and he becomes he's a living soul all right now that was god's way that he wanted it to be all right he wanted it to stay that way but remember how we covered it and brought it out let's see adam was god's way then of allowing to come into being a human body that would allow the fall to be able to take place i hope you followed that one that thought was to me was a great understanding as to see that in adam he could bring him forth and allow him to fall not make him fall he couldn't do that but he allowed him to fall to where that he could display his attributes and time all right then we took real quick because you've got four thousand years from the time of adam standing there in the garden you know even in his lost condition see then nobody else comes that away adam and eve come spirit be in first then into natural and then when the fall came it didn't take away the spirit being oh no adam and eve were still there because that's where they're standing and see then i noticed the point you know maybe it's me maybe it's my thought but when i mentioned that adam was a breathing human being with eternal life in his soul i seem to get a a backing up a little bit all right and also it's the same thing as to say that adam see that you kind of come up a little bit and talk to or listen to me about adam and receiving eternal life but when i say adam and eve that kind of backs up a little bit maybe it's me i'm just saying it maybe it's my thoughts sometimes but i don't think that we're really seeing that the way that we need to see it i don't think we're seeing it in the correct order of the fact that adam was created but then god breathed into his nostrils and he become a living soul but remember at the time that he breathed into his nostrils eve was in adam it's not that he breathed into adam then he breathed into eve amen that's where i think that we're not following that point to listen because eve frederick said was in adam in theophany well her being her person who she is she was in adam and theophany see we look at at what was in adam we look at it as uh a human flesh and we say well a rib was taken from adam and god made a woman he did but now what did that woman do i mean they're standing adam in the earth god breathed into his nostrils and he becomes a living soul we might be able to listen to that point but then when you say that eve had eternal life i seem to get a backup so all right you know i'm not trying to overwrite anything other than just try to preach it and maybe we'll all see it because see i believe that eve was in adam all right physically speaking she was there and taken physically from adam and made into a uh you know a body all right but then she had to have something and it doesn't say in the bible that he created eve and then breed into her nostrils no it's just talking about adam so then you got to bring it all back to adam that eve was in adam and whatever adam was when he separated the person of what not the person when he separated the the spiritual part as we call it our spirit part of the feminist woman you know separating that from adam remember you got to give that you got to give that life all right now there's where our problem that we i believe we fall back we say well oh okay i can believe that he gave eve life but i don't believe he gave her eternal life well where'd it come from if he was in adam then isn't it easy to fight to be able to put it into a point of to say that her spiritual being the theophany which the prophet called the soul hebrew series he said that was in he was in adam taken from adam and put into eternal life so all right now this gets the point of what i'm talking about so in the garden then when you're thinking about that god created man he created him first a spiritual being and remember he was created male and female created he him all right see eve was in that part of adam that adam was before the world ever begun well it's not where to come from then it comes down to putting that into flesh and there she stands then with eternal life in her soul he stands there with eternal life in his soul but yet their bodies are not eternal that's why the bible said that we've got to put them out lest they partake of the tree of life and watch look how perfect they were and live forever it didn't say live eternal that's right because you'd have an eternal sinner you can't do that see so it's not to the fact when they they've done it that they can't live eternally so he had to put them out lest they partake of the tree of life in the wrong way but yet what i love about it is i believe that those angels that was once protecting that tree of life the prophet said is now running you and i to that tree of life the word that we can partake of it and eventually our bodies will be made eternal i haven't got to that point so you know i'm wanting us to to to stay in it and when i come to this i hit this part and i see that well wait a minute it's not coming across so take it and think about it when god created man spiritual man spirit man that's 126-27 then he put that into 2-7 in our stands adam with eternal life in his soul but his body is not eternal because it could not have now here listens to the thought the if it's true that the possibility of the fall was made through adam we tried to cover that quite a while i mean that the possibility of the fall depended on god creating adam and bringing him in a certain way that he could fall not fall to death in the basis of losing his eternal life right no and the prophet was covered in the seal book he said adam fell from eternal life to death you say well that's there it is helping me eternally well you ended the whole possibility of any uh point of mankind in salvation or whatever but he fell from in the bases he never reached it i know i'm carnal but there's a microphone see some three feet away all right now i've got to reach that okay and i can get to that place but see i've fallen from that to where that i can't find it but a way can be made for me to come back to that and that is the tree of life that was what happened in the garden in the garden the way for man to be come forth for sin to enter the picture was permitted of god not created of god that way because you can't create sin all right see it was permitted so he permitted man to come into being in the basis that were that he could fall in the point of easy she was not an original creation meaning she was not an original person not in the point that she wasn't a part of adam huh i believe she was and maybe maybe you don't but all right just pray for me all right let's move on then i believe that eve was part of adam in the spiritual creation and then when it comes to the physical she was in him in physical creation taken from him and as he took from her from him the rib to make her star she stands as adam stood here and then god breathed into his nostrils and he became a living soul see then when eve was taken from adam she didn't necessarily have to be standing on the earth because he was the earth that she was in because he was she was over here with him in that but then he breathed into eve's nostrils and she became a living soul all right well yet the fall would take mankind into a lost condition but it did not take adam and eve to hell so they didn't fall from eternal life into bases that they never reached it because one day they will reach eternal life in flesh right one day they will reach eternal life in flesh they're not eternal now and that's why it's that away all right see then we brought it up from there let's try to run it into hurry we brought it up from there to where there was adam standing in the garden in the bases body not eternal soul eternal all right see then the second adam which was the lord jesus christ when he came into being the difference between adam and and and the lord jesus adam was created a full-grown man jesus was born or begotten through the wound of amer um of mary to where it would come forth that that you know everything would fall into the correct order all right now then that would bring us to jesus christ see throughout the old testament then you had no eternal life in soul for anybody because how could you because jesus christ had not died so he came for the purpose of dying he came to release it and all right we get to that real quick in the bases that there that jesus when he stood on earth now listen when he stood on earth what was he brother branham said and i've got them here in front of you want them he said in soul he was god but said in body he was a man now think about that that in seoul he was god the bible said that god was in christ reconciling the world to himself now why would it say it that way god was in christ you realize then to keep your understanding of doing that the body was a creation brought into being you know begotten brought into being all right but that body was not eternal so he went through his life for the 30-something years with that living in that human flesh and that human flesh was not eternal all right then look you've got the second adam being exactly like the first adam did you follow that point that i was trying to bring the second adam then the lord jesus christ stands in the garden soul almighty god body a human element same thing adam was that's why he's the second adam all right to make a way to where he could pay the price of sin for you and i heaven all right and see then that he would be a new creation but only in the basis of a new creation at that time was he uh in the point that he was god living in human flesh think about the godhead for a minute okay you realize that jesus now listen to my wording and don't get confused in the name of the way i say it just listen jesus was the flesh man right that was who he was that was his name jesus all right now don't jump away on over and say yeah but his name is gardener no just just listen jesus was a flesh man god lived in jesus and see by doing that he made the connection to the human race that he's not going back somewhere and going out of existence just remember what i'm trying to say think about it jesus the body we say but jesus was god no jesus i'm saying take my word and listen and don't jump ahead jesus was the body amen god lived in that body seeing that body wasn't eternal it wasn't the fact that it was lost or anything but it was the fact it had a beginning adam's body had a beginning jesus the body had a beginning but the god that dwelt within that never had no beginning amen he said well you know i don't well just think jesus the body and you'll see the first adam was adam the body and eternal life dwelling within his soul jesus when he came he came right back to the same creation that he had in the beginning with adam and jesus comes forth with a body a body the bible said thou hast prepared me or the father prepared him all right see that body was human elements but the difference was it was virgin born brother brother said the difference in god in you is the fact that says god was was virgin born we were naturally born but he was virgin born he went through the fact of living and and and you know and all and and within eve i mean within mary until the time come for him to come forth same thing as any other baby did but the difference is that she was not she didn't have anything to do your mom and daddy have something to do with you but she had nothing mary had nothing to do with it that's the difference in the mankind of adam and the mankind of the lord jesus but think about it and if you're thinking just just listen and just just think about it god condescending to earth and he come down and created a body his other part was him coming into being in a creation of the new creation new race all right the atom was a creation and a race but he couldn't pay the price but the lord jesus was a new creation new race why because he came for the point of paying the price all right now see then you you put it to the point of looking at it that that's why jesus could say father are you with me did he say father did he talk about his father did he talk about having a father then he was the son of god that's exactly who he was jesus was the son of god which was god made manifest in a human vessel called the sun a human vessel so that he could pay the price he had to become our head to become kinfolks to us to be able to pay the price of all of our sin and that way he had to come through the virgin mary and come into that being that away as begotten all right but can you comprehend the godhead like that and listen about it and give you something to think about because you'll run across it just just keep reading and you'll run across quote after quote after quote where brother random talks about jesus being the body and god being the spirit that was dwelling within the body but see that will never end adam's body will someday have to be made eternal jesus's body was made eternal in the resurrection right the resurrection the ascension the change as we call it his body was made eternal right amen and see by his body being made eternal made him a new creation new race no longer dealing by the old creation a new creation he was god in human flesh when you realize by the new birth by the new birth you are god in human flesh now that has a ring back to it because we think that that's that's just a little bit too far no that's exactly what it is we are his offspring we're his children he brought us into being amen all right the new creation new race stood back there and says mary and she finally recognized him right right she finally recognized that that was the lord jesus he said touch me not because i'm not yet ascended i don't understand all of that don't worry about it but there was some reason that she could not touch him at that time you can have your opinions or whatever i don't know because it doesn't bother me but i know it's true i know he couldn't she couldn't touch him all right but in just a matter of a little time she could hold touch him others could touch him something was taking place that was making that body into a position of eternity see then no man hath reached immortality which immortality means mortal flesh made eternal that's the best way of saying it thank you the lord jesus christ the body was made eternal see you and i've got to do that but why not think about it we're already in the process right yes we're in the process of being changed what do you think the change i mean my wife talked the other day about it she said what do you think the change is i said well i don't know in other words i don't know what's going to cause it or what is going to mechanically take place you know or whatever you say i don't know but i know it's got to be true all right and see then when when our body is made eternal because we're doing the same thing adam would have done had adam and eve not sinned they had the tree of life that they could have went to the tree of life and ate of that tree of life and everything would have been great all right do you realize what i'm saying to you the more you read the word of god you're reading the tree of life you're inhaling or are you know taken within you the word because that was what created all things see the logos the theophany the word of god the son of god the being that was back there is now coming forth in you you say well what is it going to be to make us well i know one thing for sure here's part of it the statue of a perfect man because if these virtues can be added to the human being it's going to bring us to a position to where that we can take the change i know that see i know that that romans 8 covers that it comes down in finality of adoptions and things and when it finishes up it says to wit the redemption of our body we got to have an adoption for it to wit to understand somebody's going to come to a place of understanding what's taking place but why can't we understand you simply if you eat you become what you are yes sir and if you're eating the word of god thank you why not eat it why not just enjoy it we said at night and listen sometimes three four tapes because wade's pecans come in this time and they're and we're we're beating their knuckles over there doing these pecans and getting them out and you know and uh maybe we could just sit there and listen to a type a little just cycle through into the next tape and into the next one into the next one i've done that on a deer stand where you just take i got the little thing that joanna made richard and them made for me years ago and i can take that and just put it in my pocket and connect it up stick it in my ear as long as the battery holds out i can just keep listening well i ain't got nothing else to do i mean i'm sitting there uh you know so i can just sit there and listen what did the prophet say about it you become the word as what as you receive it or hear it or take a part of it you become the word amen you realize what you're doing you're eating your way back now a lot of us have ate a lot the wrong way of going back you know and uh we're kind of lost out that's what i told brother langor years ago i've been around brother lungo a long time you know and he'd get on them dot things and christ died and he brother gary atkins would do it get on one boy he just lose weight and and then you say oh hey that looks good then about a month later you see him that his belt buckles he can back out you know i said brother homer i said in the years i've known you you you've gained and lost over a thousand pounds well but i want to eat the word don't you see that's the point that's what i try to do i try to get you i ask you listen you remember the other day i was listening back to what i said if you want to think about something on the new creation you raise just go to christ the mystery of god reveal and go through that message over and over and over just listen to it god had a plan and a purpose that he was going to achieve he said it was to let himself be expressed is that the way the prophet was saying let itself be expressed and see he didn't start out just now now here's one we're going to swallow and listen remember he didn't bring mankind over here and start a creation maybe i don't know how to say this but the genesis 1 26 and 27 man was in eternal life it was back there before the world ever begun right it was eternal life before the world ever begun he said this thing was started but that way and we've got to come back to that see i do know that much about the change to to come to a change we're going to have to come to the place and the bases that where the lord jesus come to a place and he was changed and you and i are going to have to come to a place to be changed it's not how much we know it's not that away well why shouldn't we know it i mean we we we're not like the denominations that you know they'll they'll just preach and go on and do we we are supposed to be becoming the word well if that's becoming the word then we're going back to where we was see we was the word in the beginning that's why the prophet could say it you know he said you always was eternal but the point of it is see don't go the wrong way of that well i always was eternal so i don't need salvation now you're wrong you're wrong you missed the whole point you need salvation to bring you to redemption all right see then the point we need to get is to see we are now going through exactly the things that the that adam went through and coming to the same end adam finally eventually stood on earth he went through stage one stage two he stood on earth then as eternal life in the soul and a body that needed redemption see then you and i are coming the same way coming to realize what we were and and knowing what we were is we know that's where we're going to have to go back to can you follow that thought we got to go back to where we started and see we started with eternal life when he gave us the new birth sure we lost a channel we lost everything we couldn't do that but when he come forth and made a way for a new birth then redemption could come into view and then you and i could say that we are a new creature in christ jesus because a natural preacher a natural person has a body spirit and soul but there are none of those eternal but a christian has within them the new birth and that new birth is to make forth and bring us to a position bring us to a change bring us up through the stature of a perfect man bring us out through the adoptional stages bring us out to all of those things the prophet taught you see why the prophet had to come he just didn't come to just show god to the world and and let them see this and that he come to get his people god come down and little man to deliver a message that's one that i'm looking forward i'm looking forward to the point of the change of the body because see i know that that's the part of redemption that is not fully made manifest yet we've come through justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost some may be coming through adoptions some coming through statue of a perfect man because everybody's not on the same level somewhere ahead of the others is up and down all right but we're all waiting one thing to wit to understand that word to wit has other meanings to it but it has a great meaning to me and the basis that i think it's in the bible 20 sometimes but to wit to understand that's where it's in the uh let's see in the scripture let me look and see yeah he said where we read in our scriptures from second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and it drops down to wit that god was in christ to understand that god was in christ reconciling the world to himself god was in christ he was in human flesh he became that's the mystery of it all is that god and man has become one he's a new creature but you see the new creation you race in the human element is not finished until we come to where where the lord jesus looks when we reach the eternal life then we are a new creature a new creation all right what are we going to look like we're going to look like him because we're in his image we're in his likeness and what are we going to be we're going to look like him because we're his offspring we're his children now we're not the the point of it is we're we're difference of sizes and differences and all kind of things but yet still we are his offspring we're his children think about it the point i'm trying to get you to see today is one thing jesus was god in human flesh called the son of god amen amen and jesus was god in human flesh called the son of god all right you know what you are god in human place called the son of god amen by the new birth you're a child of god all right jesus was begotten the only difference between him and us in the coming jesus was begotten born of a baby virgin born et cetera et cetera you know but adam was created full grown man see all right are you listening adam had eternal life in his soul he could not impart that no so it would take the second adam according to the scriptures to come forth and to be able to give us his life right amen see adam was created full grown but jesus was begotten from the wound of a woman all right in body he was a man in soul he was god a new creation adam spoke of it but he fell from coming to that position he never reached that position of eternal life in his body so he fell from it so the prophet's right he fell from eternal life to death what he died well yet he had an atonement that's right it was already made before the world ever begun because jesus christ stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world so he had an atonement amen okay amen god put his own life into adam and adam became a living soul no one else down through time until the lord jesus christ could come forth with eternal life right so then jesus would have to pay the price he would have to come in human flesh be jesus the flesh man he would have to come forth to give that life that you and i could receive that life all right now that's not hard to understand is it well is it hard to understand then that adam and eve being the first of a human race right well it was first of a human race that was a adam and eve all right they lost that position but they never lost eternal life what position did they lose they lost coming to that position of to where that they would be god in human flesh he said yeah but you're saying now that we're you know because we're the children of god adam and eve and wouldn't count it as the children of god why because they lost that position abraham was never called nothing but god's friend he was never called the son of god check your bible abraham was not a let's see how would you say it he was a special man for a special job but yet he still couldn't achieve he could speak of it he could come forth and show and god could use him but he couldn't come forth in the redemptive for you and i all right but jesus did he gave his life that you and i might have eternal life and see this is not just stopping because he's he didn't stop he didn't come forth and just deliver uh redemption as body spirit and soul his body went to eternal life so now he's a new creation do you realize when he was standing there he was a new creature a new creation god and man had become one you see that's where we got to come he said i don't see how do we could ever do it brother dale well it ain't up to us to do it amen now listen for a minute and i'll quit he's already taken care of it he's already paid the price all we've got to do is believe it and accept the fact that he's paid our price for us and that everything is there and that we are his offspring because if we have now listen that's why adam could never fall to death see that's where people would read what brother ryan says and they don't listen to what he talked about adam couldn't fall to death you know what i mean he couldn't die and go to hell or anything you want to quote from the prophet you know why he couldn't he said because he had the breath of eternal god in his soul the breath of eternal life in his soul so adam could not never be lost you realize that with the new birth christ in you there's no way you can ever be lost might have a lot of problems and things and doing life and all but you can't be lost that's wonderful to me that's eternal life in your soul and if i have eternal life in my soul then one day my body is going to follow it you say how do you know because he is followed amen he came to eternal life in soul spirit body right because he was eternal god that's what i'm trying to say to you about the godhead if you just think about it the body the body was a man amen the soul is the eternal god what about that you realize then how close we are to it we're right on the verge of being changed because that's the next thing now not that everybody has already achieved and all of that no no but somebody has i believe that i believe somebody has achieved the place and the position and they're waiting on the rest of us to realize what's taking place the prophet has brought the message eternal life is a is not just something looking out you under eternal life is the person of jesus christ coming into you and we do that by the new birth well what would be the change of the body just another step brother had a good way of thinking he's it's just another step if you remember him that's the way he made the stuff he said just another step he said it's not a long big one you got to run and jump he said it's just another step think on these things what about it we are standing at the threshold of eternal life if not then what are we going to do he said well what can you do brother dale what can we do to try to help this take place read and pray listen to the prophet's message listen to the word and you'll find out what you are right we was just in our lives not listening to one we brought around and said god said all of these viruses and things and plagues that's around here you know i mean he was he was praying for me last night and all of us right because that viruses and things is here because it's real come on musicians think on these things we'll try to pick up maybe going into some things on adoption or something just pick up a thought but the main thing i want you to see is when we start believing and seeing who we are and what's taking place right to see who we are and what's taking place not what's going to take place that's that's the problem we're looking out you're under one of these days it's going to be no already here understand think on these things what we got for you
