[0:12] on
[0:14] Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and
[0:16] Deanna no
[0:19] all right get my password back here
[0:23] been away too long yeah I know
[0:25] okay so now what we're gonna do I have
[0:30] been studying a couple of things and I
[0:32] think we're still going to try to do and
[0:34] I may do it in a sermon
[0:36] is the five comings of Elijah and some
[0:39] people have asked me to
[0:41] um
[0:42] asked me to do like a mystery Expo so
[0:46] that you can
[0:47] you can um
[0:50] present the message to people or present
[0:53] the gospel to people and then be able to
[0:55] mold it into the message
[0:59] but I'm not
[1:00] it's important over there but
[1:03] um there you go
[1:05] so we're gonna probably do this and then
[1:09] probably just do a sermon on the five
[1:11] comings of Elijah and then
[1:13] uh I'm gonna get Roberto Royal and see
[1:15] if he can send me the
[1:18] uh the whole mystery Expo part that we
[1:20] did over in uh
[1:22] in Palau and actually he sent me an
[1:24] email uh two days ago they just returned
[1:27] back from over there he baptized three
[1:29] more denominational people in the name
[1:31] of Lord Jesus Christ that were in the
[1:33] meeting so three of the 15's been
[1:35] baptized and they're going back to go
[1:39] into the churches to start preaching the
[1:40] message so wow that's wonderful
[1:44] he said he would love for me to be over
[1:46] there with him I'd like to win but um I
[1:49] just got back so I'll just leave it to
[1:50] them let them do it but what we're going
[1:52] to do is
[1:54] today just kind of do an overview on
[1:59] a subject
[2:01] of the three sons names
[2:05] all right
[2:07] now we're going to read what brother
[2:09] round says and then we'll turn it off
[2:10] now I'm just gonna give you a sketch of
[2:12] what we're going to do and then we're
[2:13] going to really Break It Down Like
[2:15] Sunday school okay
[2:17] but brother Brown says here on the
[2:19] unveiling of God said he came in three
[2:20] names three sons names now who is this
[2:23] who's the hate Christ
[2:25] comes in three nights all right
[2:29] and he came in the name of the son of
[2:31] man the son of David and the Son of God
[2:33] three sons names all right he come first
[2:36] and the son of man because he was the
[2:38] prophet now he's talking about Jesus
[2:39] coming to Earth
[2:41] because we're going to see though that
[2:42] the Son of God was before the foundation
[2:44] of the world all right but why it's not
[2:46] a man because he was a prophet now
[2:48] Jehovah himself called Ezekiel in the
[2:50] prophets the son of man
[2:52] because it says in Ezekiel prophesies on
[2:54] a man okay son of man wants to see us
[2:57] now Jesus never referred to himself as a
[3:00] Son of God remember he asked Peter he
[3:01] said Peter who do who do the man say I
[3:04] the son of man I am not the Son of God
[3:06] Peter did not answer his question the
[3:08] way he asked it okay and that stumps a
[3:11] lot of people but study it he said who
[3:14] the man say I the son of man now he said
[3:17] you're the Christ the son of the Living
[3:19] God bless the son of God
[3:21] but that was the son of God Revelation
[3:23] that Jesus Built the church on because
[3:25] he said Peter Flesh and Blood had
[3:26] revealed it to you but my Father which
[3:28] in heaven and I'll build my church on
[3:30] that Revelation well down through seven
[3:32] Church ages it was the son of God
[3:33] Revelation not the son of man Revelation
[3:35] the Son of God Revelation so he told
[3:37] people told Peter he said I'm gonna
[3:39] build my church on that but we see the
[3:42] other scriptures that come in that that
[3:44] the Bible says that the revelation of
[3:46] the son of man would have to come back
[3:48] in the end time and I know people get
[3:50] that's why I want to break it down
[3:54] slowly try to slowly break it down to
[3:58] where we see remember it's all one true
[4:00] and living God
[4:01] it's all the spirit of God the son of
[4:04] man is God the son of God's God and the
[4:07] son of David is God all right but you
[4:10] say well what's important the
[4:12] manifestation is very important
[4:14] because the Son of God Revelation as I
[4:16] was telling you before the Son of God
[4:18] Revelation is what the church ages had
[4:21] they don't have this this is the son of
[4:23] man Revelation right here
[4:25] this Capstone right here is the this is
[4:27] Jesus Christ The Headstone he was the
[4:30] son of man right right all right so we
[4:32] got the Son of God Revelation well hey
[4:34] these people are dead in the ground
[4:38] it takes the son of man Revelation for a
[4:41] body change that's what I said you can
[4:42] have all these virtues and still die and
[4:44] go by the grave right right amen it
[4:46] takes the son of man revelation
[4:49] in the end time yes yes and not one man
[4:52] but a group of people right to make it
[4:54] because that's why brother around him he
[4:56] had a revelation of the son of man but
[4:57] he was one man he was the first one to
[4:59] come to that but he couldn't be the only
[5:02] one to take a Rapture they had to be all
[5:04] of us that had to be there to take a
[5:05] Rapture so he came to what point us to
[5:08] Christ
[5:09] so we see now that what Jesus never
[5:12] referred himself to the Son of God he
[5:13] referred himself the son of man because
[5:15] the scriptures cannot be broken
[5:17] there can be nothing broken in the
[5:19] scripture
[5:22] this is my whole point right here
[5:25] one word got us out of the garden right
[5:28] one word
[5:30] got us out of the Garden of Eden not all
[5:33] right right
[5:35] so if we're one word off you think we're
[5:37] going to get back I'm talking about one
[5:39] word that's what I was trying to tell
[5:40] the people if you watch that down in
[5:42] Mobile that you have to get people to
[5:45] see well if whatever you think whatever
[5:48] I think if it's close we'll put it
[5:49] together no that's not no that's right
[5:51] that's not what Jesus said right be
[5:54] therefore perfect one word now if you
[5:57] notice in the beginning one word
[5:59] page one in the Bible Genesis 1 we find
[6:03] out that the whole all the sickness all
[6:04] the sorrow all heartaches and everything
[6:07] that ever happens to human beings came
[6:09] because one person disbelieved one word
[6:14] caused all this that's the first of the
[6:16] Bible and the last of the Bible
[6:17] Revelation 22 the same God said
[6:19] whosoever shall take one word out of
[6:21] this or add one word to it see it must
[6:24] be word by word just the way it is all
[6:28] right
[6:29] then you he went on with the sermon but
[6:32] let's go to
[6:35] this is broken sister now let's read the
[6:38] same thing I want to read you what he
[6:39] says watch he makes three comings
[6:41] he coming three son's name he come in a
[6:44] trinity father son Holy Ghost see all of
[6:46] it the same Christ the same God all the
[6:49] time
[6:50] now we know he come to bring three works
[6:52] of Grace justification sanctification
[6:54] the baptism of Holy Ghost everything in
[6:56] God is completed in threes but now
[6:59] remember see also like brother now was
[7:01] talking about he comes first to redeem
[7:04] his bride he had to come here to redeem
[7:06] us
[7:07] he comes a second time to pick her up
[7:09] right
[7:10] and he comes the third time with us
[7:13] together all right all right so what he
[7:16] done he come down as son of man to
[7:18] redeem his bride
[7:19] he comes the second time which is truly
[7:22] the subtle man in the end time but it is
[7:24] those that were died under the son of
[7:26] God
[7:27] right yeah we'll understand it later on
[7:30] and then he comes what bride king and
[7:32] queen now where we're gonna where are we
[7:34] going to be we're gonna be in the
[7:35] Millennium as king and queen so he's son
[7:37] of David to them not to us
[7:40] he's our husband right
[7:43] he's not he's not the son of David to us
[7:46] right right the son of David we'll break
[7:48] it down the son of David was promised in
[7:50] the Old Testament that David's son which
[7:53] Jesus was not David's physical son right
[7:56] right but by spiritual revelation God
[7:59] said I think so much of David well
[8:02] that's pretty tough I thank so much of
[8:04] David
[8:05] a murderer right
[8:07] whoremonger and whatever else he was
[8:10] liar
[8:11] I thought so I think I think so much of
[8:13] David until my son's gonna set on the
[8:16] throne in the Millennium ruling the 12
[8:20] tribes of Israel well what's going to
[8:22] happen we're going to be there with them
[8:23] all right
[8:25] but now look
[8:26] but when he comes this time hardly none
[8:29] but those who are ready will know when
[8:32] he comes there'll be just an absence of
[8:35] people
[8:38] graves are not going to open right we're
[8:40] not going to drive by one day and see
[8:42] the dirt
[8:43] call back off of the graves no they're
[8:47] going to come right up out of that Grave
[8:48] Just Like Jesus walked through the wall
[8:50] they're going to reach down there that
[8:52] this everything's going to pick up that
[8:54] body it's going to be changed they're
[8:55] going to walk right out so and then what
[8:58] changing the moment 20 of an eye
[9:01] but remember
[9:03] here's a couple of keys that we're gonna
[9:04] that we're going to talk about the son
[9:06] of man is the only one that took a body
[9:09] change the Son of God doesn't need a
[9:11] body chain that's right
[9:13] okay that's why the son of man
[9:16] Revelation had to come back in the end
[9:18] time to change somebody's body
[9:21] okay Jesus as the son of man what son of
[9:24] man is God in human flesh all right he
[9:26] had to come back on in human flesh Son
[9:28] of God don't need a body change son of
[9:31] God's perfect the Son of God is that
[9:33] Holy Ghost that you have in you that's
[9:35] perfect never sinned a day in his life
[9:36] right
[9:38] that's right right the son of man is the
[9:40] one that had to come the end time to
[9:42] teach us how to change a body so it is
[9:44] important that we have the son of man
[9:46] because everybody well I say this most
[9:48] people in the message think we're under
[9:50] the son of man of Revelation just
[9:51] because we're in the end time
[9:53] well yeah they might be under the Son of
[9:55] God Son of Man Revelation but do they
[9:56] have a revelation that's not a man
[9:58] because we're not going to take a body
[10:00] change just because we know that this
[10:01] was a son of man revelation
[10:04] right right
[10:06] not gonna happen this ain't an automatic
[10:08] process right if it was it'd be so easy
[10:11] and the rest of these would have already
[10:12] took it so it comes down to an end time
[10:15] to a point
[10:18] where it's going to be very narrow
[10:20] this day the scripture is fulfilled
[10:23] he come in three names he come his son
[10:26] of man which was prophet and that's what
[10:28] he did he proved his ministry by being a
[10:30] prophet but we all know that every one
[10:33] of us knows that he never said he was
[10:35] the son of God
[10:37] right okay but yet Peter said Thou Art
[10:39] the crisis on the Living God we'll we'll
[10:41] get into that
[10:42] I just want to wet your appetite and let
[10:44] you start maybe look up Son of God look
[10:46] up son of man look up the things and
[10:48] what the prophet of God said about about
[10:50] this it make it easier for me to
[10:52] to uh
[10:54] to present it if you know a little bit
[10:55] about it every one of us knows it he
[10:58] never said he was the son of God he said
[10:59] he was the son of man now today
[11:03] he's the son of God
[11:04] right today he's the son of God
[11:08] he returned back and now he's in the
[11:10] form of the Holy Ghost the Unseen person
[11:12] but yet God the Son of God and the
[11:15] Millennium he sits upon his father's
[11:17] Throne which he'll be son of David he
[11:20] revealed reveals himself first the son
[11:22] of man of prophet this age through the
[11:23] church Jesus Son of Man or Son of God
[11:25] and in the other age some David Three
[11:28] Sons now watch he continues on though
[11:31] but you notice here he said at the
[11:33] ending of the church age it had gotten
[11:34] such a mess till he would be revealed
[11:36] again
[11:37] as son of man
[11:39] in the days of life so it was a days a
[11:43] lot so is it in the days of the son of
[11:45] man as it wasn't Jason Noah so he's the
[11:46] son of man so what it's a promise of
[11:48] bringing the son of man back when those
[11:50] days are being fulfilled all right
[11:53] that's not a man when the son of man is
[11:56] being revealed he's quoting scripture
[11:57] right here how appropriate was that mix
[12:00] up yesterday and I hope you don't miss
[12:02] it
[12:03] we have we have had the revelation of
[12:05] the son of God
[12:08] all right
[12:09] actually that had that come up through
[12:11] denominational
[12:14] Martin Luther was the with the Catholic
[12:17] preaching the Trinity yet he had the Son
[12:19] of God Revelation for his time the Holy
[12:21] Ghost is the Son of God that's right
[12:23] okay Martin Luther's Holy Ghost was no
[12:26] different than yours right that's right
[12:28] it's just it didn't feed on the same
[12:30] word you're right Revelation feed zone
[12:33] or your son of God feed them
[12:36] we're gonna back up and go through it
[12:38] I'm just kind of letting you know what
[12:39] we're gonna do for the next few weeks
[12:42] is speak on these three sons name we've
[12:45] had the revelation of the Son of God but
[12:47] the last promise that Abraham had before
[12:49] the son was made or brought into
[12:51] existence the one that he had been
[12:53] promised now remember Abraham had a
[12:55] promised son
[12:56] all right and and God led him through
[12:59] his journey Son of God led him through
[13:01] his journey right there was nobody in
[13:03] human flesh that had
[13:05] the Son of God in them in the Old
[13:07] Testament right but what did he mean
[13:10] when he comes to a time he meets God in
[13:13] human flesh
[13:14] a pre-figure of the son of man
[13:17] Revelation same way with me and you me
[13:19] and you as the sons of Abraham in our
[13:23] journey we're going to meet not just the
[13:24] Son of God but down here in the end time
[13:26] we're going to meet that same man that's
[13:28] right
[13:30] but it's not going to be one man anymore
[13:33] it's going to be in a many-membered body
[13:35] yes right
[13:37] but remember Melchizedek
[13:41] was a form
[13:43] but he was not the son of man that come
[13:47] to die for you because that flesh was
[13:50] spoken into existence spoken out of this
[13:52] hey the son of man had to come just like
[13:55] me and you except it was virgin birth
[13:57] all right he had to come through the
[13:59] womb he had to grow up as a baby and
[14:00] grow all the way up Melchizedek didn't
[14:02] have to do that he was just God stepped
[14:04] into a human flesh spoke to Abraham gave
[14:07] him a sign
[14:09] and then left all right so God manifests
[14:13] himself there saw them as a prophet
[14:14] being a man and flesh God Elohim as I
[14:18] heard someone speak it a while ago which
[14:19] was the godhead Bible that was in him he
[14:21] was a fullness Elohim is the fullness of
[14:23] the godhead bodily notice there when lot
[14:26] saw when Abraham saw him coming he said
[14:27] my Lord
[14:29] there was three of them and down inside
[14:31] him lot saw two and said my Lord
[14:34] lack of Revelation
[14:36] okay
[14:37] but now remember
[14:39] lot was called out right remember lots
[14:42] of time for the foolish virgin right so
[14:45] he's not some scumbag that we think
[14:47] about he no he made it that's right he's
[14:49] gonna be in heaven right right I mean he
[14:52] made it he he was down there right in
[14:53] the middle of all that junk
[14:56] and it backs his righteous Soul the
[14:58] Bible said but there was lack of
[15:00] Revelation to get out of there
[15:02] amen so when the two went down to Sodom
[15:06] which was Billy Graham Oral Roberts not
[15:09] the person Billy Graham or Roberts but
[15:11] the anointing all right everybody okay
[15:12] with that right they didn't look I've
[15:14] heard preachers preach that they look
[15:16] like Billy Roberts I mean Billy Grandma
[15:18] Roberts please
[15:21] brother random didn't look like the
[15:23] first Elijah but he had the spirit of
[15:26] life okay right
[15:28] because you're looking at a soul here a
[15:30] soul is the real you that's what you
[15:31] look like now look when Abraham met
[15:34] Melchizedek that man looked like Jesus
[15:37] Christ yeah because that was God
[15:38] Almighty and at the often he had to look
[15:41] what that flesh looked like
[15:43] right it couldn't look different right
[15:45] right because remember when brother
[15:47] Brown said Jesus went down to Hell to
[15:50] pick up the Old Testament Saints right
[15:53] right knocked on the door he said the
[15:56] first one open door was Abraham
[15:58] Abraham we'll read it Abraham said Sarah
[16:00] there's the man that we ate
[16:03] calf and great melt with under the tree
[16:05] who was it it was Jesus Christ in
[16:07] theophany form same man same man huh
[16:14] that the often he did not eat
[16:17] the body he was in ate okay everybody
[16:20] okay with that because remember
[16:22] theophany brother Brown said he went
[16:24] over across the current time he said we
[16:25] don't eat over here they told him we
[16:26] don't eat but now what are they doing
[16:28] they're trying to get back here so they
[16:30] can't eat so Melchizedek as a theophany
[16:33] couldn't eat but Melchizedek inhuman
[16:35] flesh could eat okay so Elohim is the
[16:39] fullness of the godhead and bodily we
[16:40] noticed there when lot saw when Abraham
[16:41] saw him he said my Lord
[16:43] there was three of them down in Sodom a
[16:46] lot saw too and said my Lord's lack of
[16:49] Revelation
[16:50] and that's what happened out there the
[16:52] church ages it's been a lack of
[16:53] Revelation so notice what taken place
[16:55] here when he comes up how he made
[16:57] himself known and then he continued his
[16:59] own he talked about hey let's read one
[17:01] more could we not could I not say this
[17:03] if I had just been on my toes see the
[17:05] brother prophesied when he said to me
[17:07] what he did this day watch what he did
[17:10] right after the reading of that
[17:11] scripture in the days when the son of
[17:12] man not a man not a human being the son
[17:14] of man will reveal himself among his
[17:16] people again this day this promise
[17:19] remember
[17:20] you remember what happened when he
[17:21] preached this day the scriptures
[17:22] fulfilled right when the priest gave him
[17:25] the Bible and he read the scroll right
[17:28] this day the scripture of this hour that
[17:30] we're now living is fulfilled before our
[17:32] very eyes he turned me into the
[17:33] congregation 10 or 12 whatever people is
[17:35] out there unknown he did the very same
[17:37] thing he did at Sodom this day has this
[17:39] scripture been made manifest before you
[17:41] it's been made True before you what's he
[17:45] do what's he saying the underlying
[17:47] meaning is he's telling you the son of
[17:49] man of Revelation is here
[17:51] that's what he's saying this day this
[17:53] scripture is fulfilled the son of man
[17:55] Revelation is right here now the last
[18:00] one
[18:03] Jesus said in Saint Mark he said in that
[18:05] day the son of man will be revealed now
[18:08] remember not Son of God
[18:12] that's right
[18:14] actually the Son of God is the revealer
[18:16] of the word because it's the Holy Ghost
[18:18] the Holy Ghost is the revealer of the
[18:20] word what's inside of you is the Son of
[18:22] God what was inside of Jesus was the son
[18:24] of God
[18:25] but it was the son of God in human flesh
[18:28] the fullness of the godhead Bible ink
[18:30] where did that flesh come from
[18:32] they come from God that's right
[18:35] so if it came from God
[18:37] it was God's flesh
[18:41] amen absolutely that was God's pleasure
[18:44] what do you think he got it from right
[18:45] right it was his flesh
[18:49] now
[18:51] if he created the egg and created the
[18:53] sperm
[18:55] that's right they came from God it was
[18:57] God okay yeah it came from him I mean he
[19:00] didn't go get a piece of dirt somewhere
[19:01] you know he made an egg and he made a
[19:06] sperm now remember not Son of God so
[19:09] he's telling you not Son of God and the
[19:11] latest son of man will be revealed
[19:13] God coming three sons names son of man
[19:16] Son of God Son of David when he was on
[19:20] Earth he came as a son of man he was a
[19:22] prophet son of man is a prophet my
[19:25] brother Brown said we're a little
[19:26] Messiahs or we're little Pro we're
[19:27] prophets right
[19:29] the eagle anointing just didn't come to
[19:31] brother Branham and then leave when he
[19:33] left we're all in that eagle anointing
[19:35] so we all are prophets all right
[19:38] now not the office of a prophet right
[19:41] you understand there's Apostle prophets
[19:43] pastors teachers in evangelists that's a
[19:46] gift an office that a man can work in
[19:48] but we all have the gift of of of
[19:51] knowing that we can go up and see as far
[19:54] this way or this way as this way is this
[19:55] way we can do that because brother
[19:57] around him was the one to first come to
[19:59] maturity and if he
[20:01] give us the word then what we're
[20:03] supposed to do is what take the word do
[20:05] the same thing he did amen he was a
[20:07] prophet son of man as a prophet Jehovah
[20:09] himself called the prophets Jeremiah
[20:11] then son of man what saith thou Jesus
[20:14] come because he had to come according to
[20:15] the scripture as son of man
[20:18] Moses said the Lord your God shall raise
[20:20] up a prophet lock and unto me and he had
[20:23] to be a prophet son of man but after his
[20:25] death burial and Resurrection now he has
[20:27] been Son of God the supernatural the
[20:29] Holy Ghost God's flesh is not on the
[20:31] Earth
[20:33] his literal flesh right right God's
[20:36] literal flesh is not on the earth he
[20:37] ascended right but he gave the
[20:40] commission back
[20:42] that in the day when the son of mans to
[20:44] be revealed so he must have left enough
[20:46] Revelation for us to come back to God in
[20:48] human flesh glad when he went away he
[20:50] said I go to the father and that makes
[20:53] it sound like he went back to Spirit
[20:54] form where he went with somebody yeah
[20:57] but that means the holy spirit that came
[21:00] back into the Church
[21:02] of the spirit that's right we'll get
[21:05] into that because we're going to break
[21:06] it down because remember now brother
[21:07] remember I'm done covered here but he
[21:09] does another quote
[21:11] brother Brown says he came first to the
[21:12] son of man now he's talking about Jesus
[21:14] right everybody got that he's talking
[21:16] about Jesus Christ 2000 years ago but
[21:19] the Son of God in Revelation we're going
[21:21] to take it all the way back to the
[21:22] beginning to the creation
[21:24] okay we're going all the way back so he
[21:27] was the son of God first
[21:29] I don't know if you can say that
[21:32] Eternal being a first and a second
[21:35] he always was right I mean he always was
[21:38] a son of man that's why he could make
[21:39] him a flesh because it was always there
[21:41] where he could make him a place he was a
[21:43] Creator though Satan can't create he's
[21:44] the only one who can create
[21:46] so he had the son of man of Revelation
[21:48] you think he's the one that needs all
[21:49] this
[21:50] we're the ones that need all this that's
[21:53] right we're taking a God that you can't
[21:55] even understand he was before everything
[21:57] and he knew your thought before the
[21:59] foundation of the world but in Pakistan
[22:01] he knew that guy stop before the
[22:03] foundation of the world
[22:05] how are you gonna explain that
[22:07] okay how are you gonna explain it but
[22:09] what he done is he said okay I'm going
[22:10] to explain this to my kids I'm going to
[22:13] come here I'm going to come here I'm
[22:15] going to come here and I'm going to come
[22:17] here and they're going to be able to
[22:18] understand just enough
[22:20] to get them to where I am
[22:23] right all right isn't that right because
[22:26] he wants to be United with us it's
[22:28] wonderful to know that you're married
[22:29] like sister June and I it was wonderful
[22:31] to know that we're married but after
[22:32] about second week of being in the
[22:34] Philippines away from her I wanted to be
[22:36] close
[22:39] the same way with God he wants to be
[22:41] close to us he can't do it
[22:43] right without me and you that's right
[22:46] coming to a place that's right he cannot
[22:48] come to this earth he is barred by the
[22:50] scripture until the son of man be
[22:51] revealed he can't come down and pick us
[22:54] up and actually remember he comes down
[22:56] so far and we meet him in the air right
[22:58] his feet never touches this Earth
[23:00] until the Millennium until everything's
[23:02] done all of his the bride and the Grooms
[23:05] has been to the wedding supper and we
[23:07] come back down here together in
[23:09] glorified bodies that's the only way he
[23:11] can come back so he's waiting that's
[23:13] what brother Brown said God's waiting on
[23:15] you and I right adoption time to where
[23:18] God can pour in his fullness what right
[23:20] here is adoption this is not this is
[23:22] adoption right here all right
[23:25] and the one that takes the body change
[23:26] will have to come to adoption because he
[23:28] can't change you down here or he would
[23:30] already change them and come through the
[23:31] Son of God Revelations everybody
[23:32] understand that if you don't then we'll
[23:35] explain it that's what we're going to do
[23:36] we're going to break it down but we're
[23:38] going to start back before time
[23:41] amen
[23:42] brother Brown I'm gonna talk about the
[23:44] Son of God the logos and theophany and
[23:46] come down what's he doing he's laying a
[23:48] plan
[23:50] brother brother Branham literally picked
[23:53] up the very Mind Of God but now remember
[23:56] the only way you and I can understand it
[23:58] is to pick up the same thing that's
[24:00] right we must pick up the same mind of
[24:03] God that he did because Paul didn't say
[24:04] you need to have a mind to Christ and I
[24:06] don't that's right we all need to have
[24:08] the mind of Christ what happened was
[24:10] brother Brown was the ver was a I always
[24:13] like to say he was a big Cube
[24:16] God could pour all that down in that big
[24:18] tube
[24:19] and bring it to the people we got little
[24:22] old Mini cubes about this big around and
[24:23] sometimes just stop stopped up with
[24:26] stuff that's right but you know what if
[24:29] you can get that if you can get that
[24:31] Revelation through that little tube it's
[24:32] just the same as the big tube you just
[24:34] got to do a lot more pushing you know
[24:36] you got to push it down through that
[24:37] Cube and that's what God's doing but he
[24:39] promised
[24:41] he's the son of God now Supernatural the
[24:43] Holy Ghost but he promised just before
[24:45] the coming of the end time the world
[24:46] would get like it was in Sodom when a
[24:49] man came down in human form three of
[24:51] them two angels and God himself that was
[24:53] God the Bible said it was now he came
[24:56] down and he manifested himself there by
[24:58] turning his back to the tent where Sarah
[24:59] was and told Abraham what Sarah was
[25:01] thinking in the tent that right
[25:02] congregation says amen now remember this
[25:04] is 1965.
[25:07] um in April so he's coming to the end of
[25:10] his ministry
[25:11] at the day when the son of man is being
[25:13] revealed in other words the son of man
[25:15] the ministry of Jesus Christ himself
[25:18] because remember the son of man Jesus
[25:21] Christ cannot be on this Earth in that
[25:24] same body
[25:26] he come to the Son of God Revelation to
[25:29] present it to the people but what did
[25:31] what did Brother Brown say he's been
[25:33] bound by the door of Creeds and dogmas
[25:35] God man has shut the door right to not
[25:39] let God work like he wanted to work
[25:41] that's right
[25:41] but right here at the end time there's
[25:43] gonna be a group of people that's going
[25:45] to work exactly the same Ministry that
[25:47] Jesus had is the same Ministry we're
[25:49] supposed to have now was Jesus wrong no
[25:52] so so what's wrong with us
[25:55] if we got 13 000 different denominations
[25:57] just in the message
[26:00] what's what's wrong there's something
[26:02] wrong with that perfect ministry of
[26:05] Jesus Christ now it's brought over in
[26:06] the end time and it's supposed to be
[26:08] what brother Brown said not even one
[26:09] word off right and here we are we got
[26:12] this one this one and this one this one
[26:14] and this one got this idea and this
[26:15] one's got the idea this one's got this
[26:17] revelation somebody has got to have that
[26:20] same revelation
[26:22] let me be honest with you if you have a
[26:25] revelation that's contrary to the
[26:27] prophet's message or contrary to the
[26:29] Bible you can't have a son of man
[26:31] Revelation right amen now you can be
[26:34] blinded and be and be a son of God
[26:37] amen but you can't make it to the change
[26:38] okay okay
[26:40] because you've got you've got that one
[26:42] word off right Eve was one word off she
[26:45] died you one word off you die that's why
[26:47] there won't be many people stand at the
[26:50] body change because they're you know
[26:51] what they're going to be they're going
[26:52] to be Jesus Christ himself in Bride form
[26:56] standing on the Earth
[26:57] now you and I are that now
[27:00] but somewhere we must be one word off
[27:02] because we're still here amen
[27:05] that's just the way I say it right okay
[27:07] let's hurry the church comes through
[27:09] justification through the Luther through
[27:11] sanctification through Wesley through
[27:12] the baptism of holy ghost or the
[27:14] Pentecostal
[27:15] go right on into the perfection
[27:18] of the son of man
[27:22] because remember the Son of God
[27:23] Revelation is perfect but it's not
[27:25] complete because God's always wanted to
[27:27] live in human flesh God's always wanted
[27:29] us to live in human flesh why
[27:33] that's what we're going to end up in
[27:35] yeah all right we're going to end up in
[27:37] human flesh right we're gonna live on
[27:39] this Earth in the glorified body with
[27:40] that one word taken care of man
[27:44] that's what we got to come to
[27:46] all right
[27:47] into the Perfection of the son of man
[27:49] that when husband and wife will be the
[27:51] same South person
[27:54] God will be so manifested into his bride
[27:57] his church till they will vote they will
[27:59] both be the same they are one now you
[28:03] see where we're at because remember and
[28:05] I brought this out in the Philippines
[28:06] and they really enjoyed it because it
[28:08] and it's something very simple
[28:10] but it's very profound
[28:13] Eve was not June and I are one if we're
[28:17] truly one buy the new birth and by our
[28:20] Union as husband and wife if we're truly
[28:22] one Christians then brother Brown said
[28:25] we're one we're one in Christ but we're
[28:27] not literally one right right she come
[28:30] from a set of parents I came from a set
[28:31] of parents but Eve was literally Adam in
[28:36] another form literally when he looked at
[28:39] her he said that's my flesh when he said
[28:41] Flesh of My Flesh and Bone my bone it
[28:43] wasn't a type
[28:44] she was literally
[28:46] here's flesh made manifest in another
[28:49] form right amen you said well now we
[28:52] can't yeah we can we we better get back
[28:55] to that that's right to where my flesh
[28:57] and because what the Bible says we'll
[28:59] have a body unto his glory like unto his
[29:01] glorious body amen so he's working
[29:04] through this flesh he's got to the Son
[29:07] of God inside of you is already perfect
[29:09] already sitting in Heavenly places yes
[29:12] basically you're already raptured
[29:14] remember the Rapture started when you
[29:16] got born again right amen yes the Son of
[29:18] God Revelation but he's got to work out
[29:19] with this guy that's right if not we'll
[29:22] read it later on if not then we're gonna
[29:25] have to go back to that scripture that
[29:26] says we plant them in corruption
[29:30] and to raise him an incorruption we
[29:32] plant we literally go plant people out
[29:34] here in the soil yeah that's right right
[29:37] we literally plant them that's what Paul
[29:39] said we plant them in corruption but we
[29:42] raise them in incorruption right so
[29:44] they're going to raise that body like
[29:46] those people on those pictures in there
[29:47] that about you're never going to see
[29:49] Robert Tatum walking around with his
[29:50] fingers all messed up anymore right
[29:53] right amen that's done and gone that's
[29:55] finished his time's over on the Earth
[29:57] but when he comes out of that that's
[30:00] right
[30:01] when that body comes back together
[30:03] he'll be just as whole as he was when he
[30:05] was 20 years old that's right man amen
[30:07] but now look that's not a fairy tale
[30:10] because somebody is going to stand here
[30:13] and not have to be planted amen that's
[30:15] right and Corruption is going to meet
[30:18] its Master right here that's right not
[30:20] having because remember what was cursed
[30:22] Adam wasn't cursed because he was the
[30:24] son of who God
[30:26] right right he wasn't cursed the Earth
[30:30] was cursed that's why when we put them
[30:32] in the ground
[30:33] yeah there's a crush there that holds
[30:36] because that is corruption amen how we
[30:40] dying we're dying because of what we're
[30:41] eating out of the Earth because man has
[30:43] put so much junk and pollution in here
[30:44] that's what the curse is it's not God
[30:47] just cursed the Earth and said you're
[30:48] cursed he cursed the Earth by the people
[30:52] doing what they're doing on the earth
[30:53] nobody understand that say amen amen
[30:56] because that's what's happening to me
[30:57] and you were eating the same food
[30:58] brother Ryan said I eat the same food I
[31:00] ate when I was a little kid and I got
[31:01] stronger and bigger he said I ate the
[31:03] same food now I get weaker and weaker
[31:04] right right that's exactly right what's
[31:07] happening it's something in that soil
[31:09] that's true they can't come up
[31:13] and change you
[31:15] because it's been cursed right see
[31:18] that's why this Earth is cursed you look
[31:20] at you're looking at the curse
[31:21] everybody's looking at the curse we've
[31:22] been together a long time some of us
[31:24] where you're looking at the you know no
[31:26] you're not looking at the curse you're
[31:27] looking at the effects of the curse
[31:28] that's right we're not cursed people
[31:30] we're Sons and Daughters of God we're
[31:32] not cursed people right all right but we
[31:34] see the effects of the curse well the
[31:36] effects of the curse is Robert Tatum and
[31:39] all them that are in the grave that's
[31:40] the effects of the curse they they were
[31:43] not able to come to a revelation to
[31:46] change our bodies some of us may have to
[31:48] do the same thing but somebody is going
[31:50] to have to come to that
[31:53] look what he says right here
[31:56] now we see now what I'm saying is Eve
[31:59] and Adam were literally one person
[32:02] yes yes now look brother Brandon said if
[32:05] you got two people
[32:07] one's a devil and one's God that's right
[32:10] so we're not a second person of God
[32:13] right
[32:14] exactly we've got to understand that we
[32:17] are God made manifest in another form
[32:19] called the bride called Sons and
[32:21] Daughters of God the children of God but
[32:23] we're not different that's not what he
[32:26] said right here
[32:27] till they will both be the same when God
[32:32] walked down and looked at Adam and Eve
[32:34] like brother Brown said in one us he
[32:36] said if you'd have stood back and looked
[32:37] you would have seen three people God
[32:39] standing there Adam standing there and
[32:41] he's standing there he said but when God
[32:42] looked at him they were all one
[32:45] amen right when God said let us make man
[32:48] our own image he wasn't looking sure he
[32:50] saw all the millions of people that
[32:51] would be his bride but he was looking at
[32:53] one thing one bribe
[32:55] because there's your type when Adam came
[32:58] out of Eve I mean Eve came out Adam
[33:00] there was the title yeah
[33:02] he was literally born of his bone and
[33:04] flesh of his flesh You and I by the
[33:07] transforming power of God is coming back
[33:09] to that yeah that's right he said well
[33:10] it's impossible nothing's impossible
[33:12] with God no he gave you the Holy Ghost
[33:15] and the Holy Ghost guides you in all
[33:17] truth don't hold to them traditions and
[33:20] Creeds they were all right in their day
[33:22] see son of God's revelation
[33:24] but the flower has bloomed to a
[33:26] blossomed now it's sea time
[33:28] Jesus Promised these things now when we
[33:31] see God
[33:32] excuse me make his promises live before
[33:35] us and see that it's in us and his
[33:37] spirit is living in us that is the only
[33:39] way of worship he's talking about
[33:41] communion same thing that's the only way
[33:43] of worship only place to worship the
[33:45] only true way you can worship yeah for
[33:47] there's no condemnation to them which
[33:49] are in Christ Jesus right
[33:52] God made the promise Jesus said the
[33:54] things that I do you'll do also
[33:58] now Jesus didn't do things out of hand
[34:01] so we should be coming to the place and
[34:03] not doing things out of him you
[34:05] understand out of line that's what this
[34:07] is for right it's what we've been
[34:08] talking about that for the past year the
[34:10] things I do you'll do also and what he
[34:12] would do and and what he would do in the
[34:15] last day how it came through this age
[34:17] neither light nor day would be like a
[34:19] darkened time but said that in the
[34:21] evening time
[34:22] it shall be live so study that this week
[34:26] just look up some quotes if you wish on
[34:28] the Sun God and the son of man but we're
[34:30] going to start with the son of God
[34:33] and show the development coming down
[34:36] where God's condescending down to the
[34:38] right here where we're sitting today it
[34:40] may take a while but
[34:42] we got time until time's over
[34:46] so the Lord bless you study that we're
[34:50] going to we'll be speaking on the three
[34:51] son's name
[34:53] first one next time Son of God
[34:55] revelation
