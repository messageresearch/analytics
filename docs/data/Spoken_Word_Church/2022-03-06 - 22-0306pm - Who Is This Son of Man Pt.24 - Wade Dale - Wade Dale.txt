good to have each every one of you here and while they're taking their seats i want to you know i announced that we were going to uh going to ohio and um the end of this month in march and um for those of you that don't know it and most of you do there's a group from ohio that um that has um come out of some other churches and they're about 12 hours from here and they are really really loyal to watching the services and and brother isaac um he he got a um just just a little um i guess a little tug in his heart because they would sit around in the uh in their living room or his living room and watch the services online and you know that's kind of not like church it's kind of just it's kind of like some of y'all you know that stayed out during covid you just put your jammies on and and kicked your feet up and watch the service and turned it off when you wanted to and let the dogs run through the house and everything else well we don't do that here so so they had a um they had a purpose in their heart to uh to have a place of worship so if you pull it up on the screen this is this is brother isaac's uh basement that's the way it looked okay well hang on a minute wait he you know he's kind of a bo must be saying you must like yourself you see that he they're watching in see the mirror you know and the little boxing thing so but we're going to convert this this is what we're going to that's what we're going to dedicate now watch here's the next one brother anderson's working on it that's good here's the next one look who's on the screen run them things continuous almost all of our old services but here they are getting everything ready to go all right next and that's brother isaac and that's that's his brother in the background way far in the back that's his sister i believe right there uh and they came sister um tabitha and i cannot remember that little sister's name that came but some of those came down the other day and and um what's a little girl's name sayla sila and there's brother isaac so that's where they get some of it ready next slide they're happy yeah i think it's i think that's aaron on the screen but they play when we play they stand where we stand they sing what we sing and go to the next line this is the last one but look they made it into a place that they can have church so we're going to go up there and dedicate that little place for him and uh we're going to pray for him that that the lord will work some miracles up there amen i tell you what folks if you had a desire in your heart like they do god will send you somebody amen i appreciate them watching and listening in i really do but everybody needs a pastor you need somebody right there with you the whole time so that's what we're going to pray for i know that watch it in watching him now but uh that's the desire they started with just a just a place in the basement and now they've got look how they fixed it up so they're sitting there right now actually i'm watching in so god bless them we love them everyone they will be down here in april they're coming to be the whole weekend excuse me they're gonna be the whole weekend with us at um at

everybody okay with that make them feel at home also remember brother bob will be preaching for us wednesday night march the 19th will be our youth meeting at three o'clock here at the church brother

this afternoon so let's go to john 1 verse 1 and let's pray dear lord thank you for lord having us lord sit here and listen to you lord we thank you lord that you give us grace and as you give us mercy and truly lord it did rewrite our life there was something that was written on this part of this side of the fall that we could never get away from and it's called sin and it's called death lord you came down here and you rewrote you rewrote our life from a life of sin lord to to a life of joy and happiness like we were talking about everybody will be happy over there well i'm pretty happy myself now on this side and i pray that your people are too lord i know we have troubles and trials and tribulations i know we have sickness and pain and heartache but lord it's all worth it it's all worth it because the end result is going to be eternal life with you lord never have to have a heartache never have to have another trouble there won't be a trial or anything and if we live you know 10 billion years then we've just begun lord i pray that you'll be with each one of us lord we're i pray that we are striving toward that goal lord that we come to a change of our body and going over into the other dimension lord and waiting for you to wipe this place off and get all the sin off of it we'll come right back here lord and live with you for an eternity father we pray should be with the ones that are here the ones that are not here lord be with the ones that are traveling we ask you to sanctify us lord and lead us through this journey and you be the one who speaks today lord you'll be the one that does the revealing father we depend on you lord and only you in jesus name we pray amen in the beginning was the word was with god in the word was god verse 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth let's go and read colossians 1 and he is the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reason of the word and as we were talking i'm going to try to get to a point today that we didn't get to this morning and then continue on we appreciate everything that everybody's done we appreciate all the work that the technicians have done to uh to get us to get us to where we can do all this and it's big enough for for everybody to be able to see it so we appreciate that and we appreciate the work they did and all the uh i told them i said uh we hadn't upgraded to about 10 years ago we upgraded the next time we upgrade we're going to be upgrading we getting out of here we going up we're not going to have to upgrade equipment we're going to upgrade out of this place hey man i hope we're not here another 10 years folks good grief some of y'all will be old yeah regina really old and we just all family anyway all right well that we talked about preeminence and i want you to understand that it says to be first and hold the first place that's what preeminence means and that's what we even even when we were when we were babies see we didn't know how to uh josh when he was a little boy the first word he said was what most of you know mama does hot hot he put his hand up on the stove that jim was cooking put his hand up near near the stove and say hi huh your stove at nanny's house i'm sorry stopping that he's saying hot well see he understood one thing don't put your hand on that amen but he knew it was hot so he knew by learning not to touch that and that's the same thing with me and you as we start up the statue of a perfect man even in our in our natural journey of life we start out making plenty of mistakes we started out falling well god bless you sister good to see you did you walk in while i was praying or what but you just appeared come in the door i was somewhere else good to have you with us god bless you make yourself at home we just all one big family around here hey man i didn't hear anybody saying man so i'm saying man hey man anyway family have to watch them too but we learn how to walk we learn how to crawl we learn how to walk and that's what we're doing in god god doesn't expect us to know everything the day we got born again all right he's a good god he's a loving god and he's not a god that's gonna gonna if we fall that he's gonna just you know hit us with a two by four or do like i said this morning he's not gonna pull out the leather strap that the principal did and he's not gonna start beating on you right he's gonna he's gonna teach you and train you but now there's come a time though you know why i got whipped i should have knew better i should have known better right that's the reason you got whipped i mean you know daddy didn't whip me for for crashing the car and i never got in one right it was after i crashed the cars when he beat us to death or half to death so he never did that but mama did but he didn't so we survived hey my head shows it's still got knots in it but look it's child training so that's the way in god the same thing we try to make this thing so this christian walk so hard but it's you just need to mirror it the way the way you grew up the way you started out and the way you came up in god is the same way you come up you come up bottle feeding you come up with you know your mama now my mama did it i don't know if y'all did it my mama would sometimes she kind of crush her food up before she fed it to us we didn't have all that processed stuff where they ground it for you she'd have to mash it up and then you know peas and carrots and all that stuff and feed it to us i think she may eat it and then give it to us but chewed on it but um but that's what god does though what god doesn't just shove stuff down your throat he doesn't just take a great big piece of meat now look dad and i we ate a big old steak yesterday at longhorns don't feed that to the cambrie or or somebody little what was it do it choke him it'll choke him and kill him and god knows better than we do and better than our natural parents he knows what we need at the time we need it we just gotta cry as we'll talk to and meant i by father so romans 8 14 for as many years are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry babies daddy daddy all right but now there's a time where what did he tell moses one time he said moses why cry speak and go forward and that's what god's looking at me and you bro the prophet of god tells us that god wants us to come into speaking condition now he's already spoke god's already spoke he's given us the word he's given us creation he's given us prophets he's given us teachers he's given us everything in our life but there's a time when he wants you to speak and you won't speak if you're if you're grown up enough because the prophet to god remember he said power without character is satanic why is that listen if god gave you all the power and you were a baby trouble yeah first thing you'd do is somebody make you mad you'd zap them out of existence right but now that's not god as you going up the statue of perfect man brother brown says you pray for that person you would pray for that person instead of condemning them or damning them to hell you know you understand what i mean that's what we do a lot of times but if we have patience godly patience it'll help us grow godly patients will help us grow regular patients will help us in life but patience with god how many of you want it and want it right now 99.9 of it yeah you want it you want it right now uh jim's stepmom had a had a thing in her kitchen that says lord give me patience but i want it now so that's the way we are but what happens though if we do that and god gives us and we step out above that or beyond that we make a mistake because we can't go out past god's program whatever his program is we've got to get in it stay in it right and then he will do what he said he would do but now if we go do our own thing we're going to really mess up amen but we can do our own thing as a child and we will get our fingers caught in the door we'll get our hand burnt we'll get our whatever you want to say when we're children but as we grow up we shouldn't be we shouldn't walk up to the to the oven and say hot no you don't put your hand on that because you've grown same way with god we've grown up in god we've had so many years lord of mercy we've had so many years to grow up and and we're slacking all of us we're all slacking behind on on growing up all right so let's go to the next one let's go to we talked about headship this morning and that's for the head of the church listen without a head your body can't work without a head your body can't work natural now you can have the prettiest body in the world but no head yeah it's not going to do anything it's just going to lay there all right so you got to have headship which is we know that's jesus christ and we give him the preeminence to take over but look we look at these i kind of shortened this up a little bit when under headship we talk about creation we're a new creation a brand new man we were talking about we were singing about it this morning but do you really believe that do you really believe that you've been recreated that you have there is a there is a creature a creation inside of you different from the old creation because if if you're still in stuck in this creation here then you're of the world and you're of the devil if you do the things of the world you're of the world and the love of god's not in you amen that's why we look different act different and people say there's something different about you why do they say that because they see the normal and then they see you and go why don't you and why don't you and why don't you you know you understand what i'm saying well you know why because something inside of us another creation has been made inside of us called the baptism of the holy ghost or the new birth the old man is dead and all things have become new amen not just divorced you can't divorce the old you because you can he'll kill he'll raise his head back up but now if he's dead you can accuse him all day long you go out in the cemetery and accuse that person laying there you can accuse them of everything in the world guess what they didn't do it because they're dead that's the same thing with me and you the old nature must die the old creature must die the old creation now we know our body still lives but it's that old nature that we're attached to that old person that would rile up when it doesn't now rile up that it would take a drink of beer or whatever you want to call it just you know brother and sister always called a laundry list we always have this laundry list i don't smoke i don't drink i don't cuss i don't i don't do this i don't do that god doesn't worry about any of that hello god wants change inside here once he changes inside here the outward appearance is gonna automatically happen amen you plant an apple tree an apple seed you put an apple seed in the ground apple tree comes up guess what comes on you shouldn't be surprised that you get apples right whatever seeds planted that's what's going to grow and that's what's going to come on the fruit at the end of the vine all right so that's the same way with me and you plant the seed of god amen get the new birth get into the kingdom of god and he will teach you he's obligated to his children he's uh just like i'm obligated to mine your ob god's obligated to his children to make you another creation apart from this creation as as the prophet of god was telling us this morning then we come down to look at dispensations and stages and anointings does everybody understand that we're coming through dispensations there's no way that me and you can stay in like luther was a prophet of god that's what brother i'm saying for his age amen luther martin luther everybody with me but he drank a beer and smoked a pie and talked about god because that's all god required was is the just shall live by faith no no venus don't have to pay to get you don't have to pay to get good that's what the catholic church is you pay us and you you pay us you pay us and we'll make you good no god's never had that in the bible nowhere amen there's no good no not one but the dispensation of that was clear that that's what god was working in at the time he was working and then what happened martin luther passes on john wesley raises up god raises up another prophet called john wesley and john wesley looks back at that and says i think i'll take that just shall live by faith plus get away from the smoking and the drinking and he did he said tea even didn't have any any uh good quality about it so he lived so much of a sanctified life and if you read the history his wife was pretty tough he had to be sanctified read about it she really give him a lot of problems but that's okay that was his thorn in the flesh i guess i don't know but he but he preached sanctification right then you come over into pentecost where the where the gifts came back in 1906 the gifts were restored the holy ghost fell on the day of that pentecost not we know it fell 2000 years ago but in 1906 the holy ghost fell that was a dispensation of the holy ghost that was the gifts being restored why i went against restorative martin luther and john wesley what in time wasn't the dispensation it wasn't the stage of the journey that god was on hello god's on a journey too amen he's gonna and you know what he's on that journey to make sure that we stay in line in that journey all right right place right time right spirit right dispensation so me and you now are in the age of adoption we've got the baptism of the holy ghost we've got the new birth we know it's justification sanctification in the baptism the holy ghost makes the new birth we know that but we got to stay plush too what happened to the pentecostals brother brown said they cabbage down and for us that don't know what that means they stopped and said this is it we've got the gifts working in our life we're just among angels we're speaking in tongues and and god is honoring what we're saying this must be it and brother branham says no that just gets you started you're just getting started at that point but they said no this is it and we're not taking any more no furthermore of the word of god because they figured they could just speak in tongues and just live any other life life they wanted to i was around one one time it didn't matter what he was doing in his life but as long as he was speaking in tongues and as long as god was you know giving him that feeling you know that jerk feeling you know he was jerking you know and he was all right temper to fight a buzz saw curse like a sailor but it really didn't matter to him that was what he grew up in that he was as long as he shouted and spoke in tongues he was fine but we got to take that plus there's nothing wrong with shouting speaking in tongues but that's not just all it is there's more to it than that and now we're in that age of more to it all right there's more to it there's more given there's more required you and i in this age are required to come to full adoption we've read that this morning but let's look at three divisions one because this is where we are we pre we are predestinated unto this adoption of children according as he has chosen us in him when before the foundation of the world like i said this morning jesus didn't come to bring us our inheritance he came to make us a way to get back to the inheritance what did trying to think what did boaz boaz was the kinsmen redeemer right he redeemed what naomi already had she had lost it like we'd lost we got lost but he's redeeming back what she had he didn't redeem back somebody else's stuff he redeemed back here so the same way with me and you he come to the earth to redeem those that would say yes the baptism of the holy ghost the ones that the bride of jesus christ is who he came for everybody okay with that i'm trying to get through this so we can get to a point but having predestinated us into the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now remember the adoption and the placing is two different things and we'll get into it in just a minute because it is two not totally different things but you can have the new birth and not be adopted but you can't be adopted without having the new birth all right they'll be okay with that all right just like the bible says who can call jesus to christ without the holy ghost even something simple like that yeah you can say well i know jesus christ yeah but is he a personal person to you or is it just somebody you know amen think about that all right the next thing we're going to go to is we're talking about this morning we're talking about obedience and we'll talk about full obedience so let's read the quote here full obedience right here the token is the sign that the purchase has been what made and been accepted amen made and been accepted for complete obedience puts you and the word one you believe it every bit and all of it's in you and you watch it working through you we're going to get into that because that's what is manifestation making known manifestation is making known what god's done in your life or what god's got inside of you or what the devil's got inside of you because excuse me the devil's going to manifest himself too he's going to manifest himself in a person called the beast pope whatever you want to call him he's going to manifest himself because listen this is as the song says this is manifesting time you will manifest what's inside of you i do you cannot we we've had a lot of people have held it back look at some of the people that are leaving the message and all the different things if they never had anything they hid so much they hid so much inside of their self but remember brother branham he went and prayed for that girl well he didn't go pray for the girl he talked to the girl's pastor remember they were talking about give her another hypo she said you've lied to us you've lied to us he said she was a piano player or the sunday school teacher and when her life when she started dying her real life popped up brother brown said or came up in other words it began to break open and she said i'm lost i'm lost and her pastor said oh sh give her the hypodermic needle you know get she's gone crazy what he was saying was i hadn't done my job shut her up that's exactly what he was saying well lord i haven't done my job you need to shut her up but that's what brother brown said the real person came up so there was nothing and the same thing with me and you as i said before back a couple of months ago i said you're going to manifest so we might as well just let out what we already got inside of us let it out good bad or indifferent let the thing out if it's a demon i want it out anyway if it's god i want to be able to show it because you can't get rid of god you get rid of the demon but you can't get rid of god once you get him you got him he's not an indian giver thank god he's not an indian giver but full obedience puts you in the word one you believe it every bit and all of it's in you and you watch it working through you everybody got that then we read the questions and answers number two i'm trying to fly through this i'm sorry i got to get to a point i didn't get to it this morning so i got to cover this point and the point in the afternoon so if you want to nap a little go ahead now and i'll wake you up in just a few minutes don't worry luis where's the where's louise oh he's in the back did y'all notice what he was doing did y'all hear what he was doing when he's up here he's got a tambourine on his shoe you notice that you didn't hear it i heard him in there it's on his shoe and it's on a it's on a piece of stretchy stuff and he's sitting there patting your foot and he's going ding ding ding ding ding so anyway so he's manifesting he's actually exactly letting some of that colombian come out not columbia south carolina the country of columbia but i i want to get to something so just bear with me just a second number two is let's go to number two number two on questions and answers he said the headstones yet to come all right so what is the headstone the headstone in the bible was jesus christ and jesus christ was rejected right despised rejected no one loved him nobody knew him until he came back on the day of pentecost but everybody left him and the bible says that the head has been rejected and he's become the chief cornerstone which we know that this is the headstone if we look at it in a picture this is a headstone it was rejected right that's why i had to come back but he became the chief cornerstone so look at these little corners right here oh june where's my wife we need to get this picture before we go to ohio so call china and see if we can get them all right doing my work while i'm here okay sorry if i don't i won't i won't remember it remember what but this is the cornerstone but what is the cornerstone it looks just like the pyramid jesus christ never changed he never changes now he changes his form but he never changes his attitude or his character his character is always the same so he started down here on the day of pentecost with the cornerstones and built up this church again and then in the end time he sent a little prophet by the name of william branham that we believe everybody got sent a prophet okay all right i just have to remind them every once in a while but this thing wasn't though there and it's and it's separate it's away from because this is the church the body this is the body that's the head the body's being built which is the bride of jesus christ and then we we're looking for the headship to come or the opening of the seals and we know we need to get into that we will that'll be something we'll get into a little bit later on but see the seals the seals when they open when the prophet of god opened them there in 1963 remember jesus had already preached him in matthew 24 so it wasn't that much of a mystery but it was the greatest mystery that nobody understood what those seals were one two three four five six seven they thought it was this they thought it was that but then we had a little prophet come along he had to be adopted he had to be taken out of the mountain out there in tucson arizona i believe when the cloud appeared and said here you him so we had to hear this message to get the headstone back here which the headstone is what christ and the headstone is who the son of man the son of man is the headstone that's when he walked on the shores of galilee 2000 years ago that was the head of all things that was the fullness of the godhead bodily he actually had his bride inside of him he'll never go wrong if he's got his own bride inside of him but what has he got to do let her out he's got to get her out so on the on on calvary what did he do he released his life he released the bride and on the day of pentecost we've said many times before satan is pretty much a fool to know that he to think he can try to defeat his own creator number one right and number two if he would have left jesus alone jesus would have just died an old man he was a human but satan had to kill him satan had to put him on the cross and had to kill him but you know what he did he created something god had a creation inside of him and satan was just used in the hands of god to release it because on the day of pentecost guess what satan had to deal with 120 little jesus not just one then there was three thousand little jesus born hello somebody acts two there was two thousand down three thousand down in down in below the upper room that that was low jesus and they've been little jesus is born all since that that's a bunch of little jesus is sitting in here today amen pearl devil bless his heart i don't i do feel sorry for him but i don't feel sorry for him he can't get born again he just can't he he won't believe it but if he would get born again look at the problems we'd get rid of but ain't going to happen he's go he's got his place he's got his dispensation and he's got his stages to go by remember beast false prophet all that he's going to head up to what he's going to head up to a headstone he's going to be the head of this natural church satan incarnate's going to be ahead of this natural church god incarnate's going to be ahead of this spiritual church amen but we're going to be out of here when that natural church goes into the tribulation but the headstone's yet to come but it's on his way when those seals opened i believe there was a way made for me and you to see what god had had in his mind before the foundation of the world and not just to see the written part of it we got a revelation we got a revelation of that because the book is now open according to revelations 10 that the book was open when the mighty angel came down so we're in an open book age we're not in the closed book age we're in an open book age where god's not going to wink at our ignorance if we're baptized in the name of the father son holy ghost i was just reading an adoption series this morning where brother brown said absolute false doctrine was baptism in the name of father son holy ghost absolute false doctrine come from the pits of hell he said one time that's pretty tough well brother that's what jesus said jesus said in the name he didn't say names he said in the name what's my name samuel wade now i'm a person i'm a human i'm a postal employee but i'm one person and i don't sign postmaster on my checks i sign my name amen i i can't believe that the whole world and they are deceived by this and the bible tells us plainly that the whole family of god is named jesus christ that's what the bible tells us heaven and earth everything has got a name and it's the lord jesus christ and then we become baptized in titles which doesn't even put us in a family we're talking about family here all right talk about family all right let's go to galatians 4 let's real quick and we'll start with three stages of adoption everybody all right those of you that are awake oh thank you somebody punch and wake somebody up galatians 4 1. now i say that the heir as long as he's a child we covered it this morning just the background a minute difference nothing from a servant though it be lord of all listen what brother ernie always say our our attitude determines our altitude right think about that our attitude determines our altitude so if you take somebody that says well i'm a i'm a child of let's say the king of wherever let's say the king of england or or something like that and he stomps out when he's about four or five years old and he said i'm here to take over i'm gonna make all the decisions i'm gonna drive the car i'm gonna i'm gonna we're just going to war at five years old yet he was a son they couldn't deny he was in the realm of being the heir but i'm sure the daddy looked at him the one that was ruling at the moment i looked at him and said shut up son go back in there with the servants and bring me some coffee i am really glad that my daddy was not my boss in life working life because he said if i had a business he said my kids would start out cleaning toilets you know what he said that's what he said and he said it over and over and over he said i'd have them clean and toilets well that's what this is he was a son but he had to learn jesus learned by the things he suffered you're not going to learn by the things we suffered but but really i mean i did own a company for a while several years but i didn't start out as the owner i worked as a truck driver because i wanted to learn the business the ins and outs the ups and downs so for if a guy could come up to me that was driving the truck and he said look i'm having an xyz problem i don't know what he's talking about instead of going i'm the owner don't talk to me now how'd you like to have a box like that are you cleaning houses and somebody never cleaned the house that's like these people that write books about children and never had a child today of their life i cannot believe that i cannot believe you got all these people that are just they you they get on television and they got all that and everybody listens to them and you're going they ain't even married what are you talking to me about being married they ain't married we got to have somebody with experience i want somebody with experience i was reading brother brown yesterday he said he said look i don't want a surgeon that just come out of just come out of school you know to operate on me not the first operation you got to put me out a long time before this guy comes in the room but what about an old seasoned veteran that's who you want to work on you so an old seasoned veteran that if there is a problem he knows how to handle it well the same thing with god you start out as no different from a servant though you be lord of all though inside of you is the ability to become a a not a servant excuse me but somebody with authority authority is what we're looking at authority sure we want to just like what brother brown said he said when you get born again you know and you ought to remember this when you get born again well let me just tell you my appearance you get i got born again and for about six or eight months my daddy was so gracious not my natural daddy my spiritual daddy and whatever i asked he just laid it out there how many have you been through that but then about a year or so later somewhere the cable got cut and god went on vacation and we're like where you at daddy i need you just like i needed you six months ago you know what he says he calls down grow up i give you all your provisions that you need i sent you an apostle prophet to pastor teacher and evangelist i've sent you somebody that can help you with your issues why are you calling to me all the time amen well that's the way god same way god does but we're under tutors and governors teachers and governors until the time appointed to the father and then you know brother brown tells us he says sometimes he said the holy spirit will go to god and say this guy is a renegade he's just not doing everything you're supposed that he's supposed to do he's not like to chip off the old block he's wanting to do his own thing but now what does god do god doesn't say okay we're going to kick him out of the family no once you're in the family you're in the family for good but god wants you to grow up so he gives us tutors and governors trainers listen we've had 60 years since the prophet left 60 some odd years and what have we done with it we still babies we still have to it's not wrong to call you pastor but my word why bother him if the cat's sick put your hands on the cat yourself me and jim several times we had um cocker spaniels and they're notorious for hip dysplasia which means their hips go out of joint and they'll just flatten out on the floor and they'll start whimpering like a baby we just picked one up one time we just said we're not taking you to the vet we're praying right here all right honey laid our hands on that little black dog and all of a sudden gone she didn't have any other problems with it that i can remember but you don't have to call you take what's inside of you even just being a baby if you're able to know who to contact right it's who you know how to contact and how do you know that well we're reading right here in adoption number three we'll get to our point in just a second we talk about teaching teaching places a man positionally what he is listen it's like we were talking the other week it's really it's wonderful to have someone come in and get your emotion up because we are emotional people well some of us are some of us are not so we need that i think we all do okay but not all the time a balance bring in a good teacher bring in a good apostle a good i wish we could find a prophet like brother dale said always if we could find one we'd bring him in here some of y'all wouldn't come to church but remember he's got discernment think about that one a man laugh a little bit if you need to wake up a little bit but teaching places a man positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith think about that read that quote we are we can nev oh everybody believe brother brown was a prophet if we i just want to make sure y'all still got the same crowd here able to have faith until positionally we know what we are now being a son and daughter of god that is a position but you got to do the plus part the next position is is what we're going to talk about in just a little while is the placing we'll talk about that in just a second but teaching places a man positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are all right so let's read number four and then we'll get started here everybody okay we got just about 30 minutes we'll take communion in just a minute now what is adoption now let me get this now i don't know whether i won't have time to go through this but i'll hit it then there's a question you can ask me later in the message listen your adoption is not your birth i've read that over and over and over again so you ought to understand they're two distinct different things in your life of a christian journey all right your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing and we're going to talk about that in just a minute when you were born john 1 17 i believe when we are born of the spirit of god we are sons of god but we are predestinated what are we predestinated to adoption now that was me not the quote now here's what i'm trying to get get you to for this son of the sons of the last day that's us see we're predestinated unto adoption but yet look now here we are now this is what hurts pentecostals a little bit i got born again praise the lord got the holy ghost fine you're a child of god that's right but yet that ain't what i'm talking about see you're predestinated unto adoption adoption is placing a sun everybody got that say amen all right so now let's start wake up just a minute let's get this let's get this into this important part we were in a little bit of it the other day but let's jump in a little more so three stages of adoption first stage is the birth anybody okay with that you gotta have a birth so it is part of the it is part of the stages or dispensations or whatever you want to call it anointings because listen without being born again number one you can't enter the kingdom of god you can't understand the kingdom of god and listen god's not obligated to talk to you because he's not your daddy at that point he's not your daddy until you're born again now he's the father we know they're sons come on people but god protects his children not the devil's kids i thank god for that i you know we're different and that god wants to make us different not that we want to be segregationless as we were talking about the other day got to segregation list he said you don't get with that evil bunch over there you don't marry into that bunch of heathens over there you don't dabble around in the world i want you segregated or separated from that evil all right so let's get started for as many that are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god that's pretty cut and dry most of us before we became led by the spirit of god we were led by a spirit god says we were led by spirit it wasn't holy amen but we got rid of that one and we got a new one we got a new spirit a new creation a new you like brother brown said nothing oh you made over a new you a new person for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby you cry father father abba father because listen because we're into the family we receive the spirit of adoption the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of god all right here we are we're children we're children of god thereby children of god amen we are the children of god if you're not the children of god it's real simple give your heart to the lord give your heart to the lord all right it's real simple people make it too complicated and if children that's that word if the biggest word in the world and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together and if children then heirs heirs of god and join heirs with christ so whatever he gets we get but there's still a time listen if if paul would have ended that that would have been it that would have been all we had to do if he would have ended that chapter and that was the end of the book of the bible that's all we had to do nope there's a lot more to that amen but let's talk about this for a minute this is your birth we know we've talked about be having heaven the new birth but we do not believe in this church that you got the new birth just because you believe this message the devil believes this message and he come to church for you did and he'll probably leave after you do well actually he'll probably leave with you joey don't bother you when you go home oh yeah that's what i thought okay so we we're talking about the same devil right okay let's talk about the same devil okay all right i thought maybe there was a different one that i only had that one but we come to church and we listen to the word of god and it's supposed to change us the old has been made new think about this you young people old people you did not get the new birth by just a thought it's not just a good thought or a good idea you know i met people in the message a long time ago that had the attitude that because they were in a message they had something different somebody else and they were better than somebody else see that's the wrong attitude right there that's the wrong attitude remember our ad our attitude determines our what altitude all right if you got born again and it made you arrogant you didn't get born again if it humbled you that god the creator would come down to you and change you because you asked him and you cried dad i need some help i want to be your child and you know what he says okay i've just been waiting all these years for you to say that and then he gives you the new birth and what does it do it changes you it changes the way you even think man if you still think i mean listen we still have those thoughts we can't help them i wish we could i wished our brain was born again not just our soul amen i do because that's the greatest battle that that's where that battle is is right here if you're born again there is not a battle in your soul there's not a battle in your heart of you not this thumping thing but if you're not born again you got a problem here and here but get this thing born again because in your spirit realm you're not memory reason conscious effects and imagination that is our problem the memory of what i did didn't get washed away when i got born again now listen it got washed away to him it got washed away to god because god said i'm going to forget them i can do that and i'm going to put them in a season deep you can't even find them and i can't even find them how many times do we worry about things we did and we say god forgive me and he's like what are you talking about what are you talking about why do we keep bringing them up if they're buried and dead don't dig the sucker up why would you want to dig a dead body up whoo stinketh that's what it is think but let it go i'm glad he don't remember him but our fight is the battle in our brain of our memory reason conscious affection and imagination so if you're born again today i'll promise you you're going to have trouble you're going to have trouble listen when i was a center it didn't bother me to go i didn't go to bars anyway much but it didn't bother me to go to a bar that made me put a beer in the refrigerator didn't bother me put a cigarette in my mouth which i never did smoke but it didn't bother me if i did because why there was something inside of me and said hey it's okay that old you was like ah it's okay you can curse that person out it's okay he deserved it right but now when that person curses at you what do you do you say god i used to be that way thank you for forgiving me now forgive him or her can we say that can we say and really mean it god jesus hanging on a cross stephen being stoned he said father don't let this be on them forgive them and i believe they did because you know who was standing there holding the coat when stephen got stoned mr saul or paul mr saul he was standing there holding the coats and he was participating not stoning but he was there participating but you know what that bothered paul all of his life because he was a human he knew he had put those christians to death he caused him to blaspheme and now god was going to use him though to open the door to the gentile church what am i saying doesn't matter what you've done folks and you say well i may have blasphemed the holy ghost if you have one desire in your heart one one desire in your heart to do better for god or want to want to have more of god you have not blasphemed when you blaspheme that's it you're done even if you did try like judas did and like uh jake esau did not going back and one day you'll just sear your conscious and you'll be just you'll be just worse than you were before but let's talk about this just for a minute let's read second peter 1 verse 1. everybody all right simon peter servant the apostle of jesus christ look to them that what have what oh i'm sorry not upset yet thank you thank you peter i believe i leave i was driving a car today hey listen we've got some young kids that know how to do stuff back then that in that in that uh room back there and we've got some really good brothers that are training them too and with this new system it's totally different than what they've done before so just bear with them and we all do just hurry up a servant an apostle that was the devil said that i'm sorry i apologize yeah that's right i'm just human look but look to them that have what obtained obtained like precious faith now this is the part where we we were talking about the other day where you've got a side over here that that preaches that that you don't get anything until you that you got to get all these virtues and then god gives you the holy spirit okay according to this chart we're looking at and then we've got another group of people in the message that says you got it all when you believe you don't need anything else just sit back and relax they're both wrong but they both do have some truth but look but you to them that have obtained light precious faith with us peter was born again all right through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god in our lord jesus our lord according as his divine nature divine power has given us all things that pertain to life and godliness wow even in our life our natural life and our spiritual life through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue now watch whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these the prophet said these promises you might be partakers of the divine look how that word divine divine nature divine power he's talking about the new birth before you go up to pyramid how you gonna get all these listen how are you gonna get the nature of god if you ain't got a part of him in you anyway no way we've got a nature all right if we don't have a nature of god but it ain't of god look having escaped the corruption that is in the world through us and besides this giving all diligence add everybody with me ad besides this in other words what besides having the new birth add this to it is that crazy no it sounds exactly the way i read it and besides getting all this giving all dylan just add to your faith virtually your virtual knowledge you got to get the divine nature of god before you can decide whether that nature that's coming in you is divine or not because listen some of these virtues are just man-given they some people that do not have a temper hadn't met many of them yet because remember well remember my spirit irritates their demons so anyway and besides this giving all dylan just add so there's the ad there's the new birth everybody okay with that now acts 2 38 well here we go let's read this then peter said unto them repent that's our problem we're wanting people to get baptized we want to throw them in the water let's get them repented first repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus i'm sorry i'm loud i'm sorry where's some ear plug maybe baptize every one of you name of the father and of the son oh now wait a minute this is peter right this is peter didn't peter when jesus was there didn't peter say all right peter said i'm gonna give you a key i'm gonna give you a key and whatever you lock on earth i'll lock it in heaven whatever you loose on earth i'm gonna loose it in heaven so why in the world would on the day of pentecost he's getting ready to loose the holy ghost onto the world and him tell them to baptize in the name of jesus christ oh peter wait a minute you were standing there jesus told you baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost well that's exactly what is happening because the name of the father and of the son and the holy ghost who is jesus christ and that puts you in the family repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall what receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise isn't to you and to your children and to all that are far off and even as many as the lord our god shall call repent and be baptized and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost wow that's pretty stout but guess what that's your new birth let's go to number five read this one real quick an adoption series watch this in this promised land and i want to kind of slow down just for a second i'm sorry in this promised land everything belongs to us in the promised land now what did i just tell you the promise was the new birth right i just told you the promise is to you it's the promise of the holy ghost not just to be an anointing but to live inside of you and make you a child son and daughter of god all right in this promised land everything belongs to us in the promised land now look potentially everybody with me potentially israel possessed that land of canaan potentially because god give it to him god said abraham wherever your soul your feet is that's where you're going to possess but they got driven out of that land because of what disobedience idol worshipers they didn't stay with the one true god so god drove them out of the land right but it was theirs god said you're going to be out of that land for 400 years 400 years remember he told them but i'll bring you out with a mighty ham because you know what i give you that lead i told abraham wherever his feet landed that was your possession wherever you walk that's why footsteps means possession that's why we've walked all over this world and we've possessed this earth because being the bride of jesus christ we own this place here's a shocker we're going to live here for an eternity too we're not going to live on no cloud how boring would that be no we're going to live on earth because we were actually abraham adam was what god of the earth we're coming back to what full redemption god in me and you we own this earth he give it to us so look see brother collins see everything in the promised land when israel crossed over this jordan into the promised land fought down everything now he stopped now watch now remember in this promised land that don't mean you are immune from sickness you say oh see that's where the pentecostals failed they said oh we got the holy ghost we speak in tongues we're among angels everything is hunky-dory if you don't know what hunky-dory is google it in this promised land that don't mean you're immune from sickness that don't mean you're immune from trouble but it does spell this oh let it sink deep it's yours just rise up and take it wow rise up and take it all right let's go to number six we'll get back to the promised land in just a minute questions and answers 1961. let's just read the red the promise is the promise is the baptism of the holy of the spirit which is promised all through the old testament do you all know that it was promised in the old testament sure it was and knew too see the promise behold i send the promise of my father upon you peter said that on the day of pentecost that's what joel said right it is hot in here y'all were fanning this without warm that is the promise the promised land is to live in this land of the holy spirit that's god's promise for the church is to live in the power of the spirit wow it's another world wow it's another land you have to come out of the conditions that you've been in to come out to live in this promised land to receive the promise remember the promise you shall receive power from on high after this the holy ghost has come upon you and peter said that the promise that was made all down through the testament old and new you find promising on up on up to that day of pentecost and then they entered into that promise let's go to number seven adoption 1960 look now that son is going to be the heir of everything that he's got he's an heir but i'll watch and when we are born in the kingdom of god by jesus christ we're an heir of heaven joy heirs with jesus because he took our place he became us that we might become him he became me that i might become him join heirs with him all right now remember that's to each one of you now remember god predestinated you by foreknowledge anybody okay with that that you were coming to this to what adoption you gotta get born again first then you come to this everybody understand it raise your hand god by foreknowledge predestinated you to come to the promised land what is the promised land for the christian today just raise his hand your hand if you know it the promise is unto you and your children what the promise of the holy ghost all right so the baptism of the holy ghost puts you as an air it puts you in the will right puts you in the will because remember if you're not in the well why do you need to go to the court why you're not gonna get anything but once you get into the will of the bible then there's all your promises now it's the promise when you get into that land it's a promise that you can be positionally placed and that's what we're going to talk about just for a few minutes let's go to the second stage placing or adoption now here is romans 8. we read romans 8 14-17 all right so now we're on verse 18. so it just i just broke these apart now watch for i reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in jesus for those of you there to wait that doesn't say jesus that says us revealed in us now we're heirs and joiners at the new birth that's what should be revealed to you i am a child of god now that i am a child of god and i'm in the will when when the when the testator died he wrote a will jesus died you can't have a testament without the death of a testator that's what the bible says so jesus christ had to die to give you a will every sunday you walk in church god is reading you the will he's telling you what you got that was weak [Applause] he's telling you what you got but now listen if you're not born again number one you probably won't be in church so you won't hear the reading of the well but because you're in the family you get every bit of this this is your will his will is his what his word so you come every sunday to listen to the reading of the will now the reading of the will doesn't just say you're born again that's it stay a baby i don't want to use you i don't want to be revealed in you that's not what god said totally opposite he said i want to be revealed in you and through you i want you to have every promise in the book every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line amen so let's go a little bit more second stage for the earnest expectation watch this of the creature now that word is translated also to creation for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god watch for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly if you don't understand what that is watch for the earnest expectation of the creation waited for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creation was made subject to vanity in the garden of eden before the fall the world was created perfect right but because of one little thing that happened everybody got it you're made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope in other words christ had to come to bring us back to that because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption and to the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation look groaneth and travail us in pain together until when now until right now everybody okay with that now this is the placing or adoption this is not your new birth this is after you're born again you've come into the family of god you start reading the will to see what god's give you and you come to church and you listen to a preacher teach you how to read the word of god whoa bro wait i'm gonna read that for myself i can go to the house and read that yeah you being just as confused as the rest of the world that's why we come to church folks that's what we come we come to know that the right will is being read and that when i get what i get is right here in the bible and you open up to anywhere daniel hosea i'm sitting here reading now you look at all the even in the old testament you've got you've got promises from listen the greatest promise is genesis 1 26 god's going to have a family he's going to create himself a family but what's going to happen is is when satan stopped the son and daughter of god from being born in the garden of eden god just said okay that's fine i'm still going to bring my children i'm just going to do it a couple thousand years later i'm going to come down here and do it myself because adam failed but this second adam will not fail and what did the second adam why did he not fall for he not he didn't fall for satan's life and he had me and you inside of him so he had to get us out all right so let's read this real quick now we're going to come to the stage of adoption of placing listen to this believer's position in christ number eight we'll read this real quick and then we'll get ready to take communion in a minute now in the spiritual sense after we were born in christ look after we were born in christ we became children of god but then see god knows best now here's what i say reverently disagree with my latter reign brethren you think i'm persecuting the church no my dear brother no no this boy after he got a certain age he had to be adopted into the same family he was born into ah so now we've come to the second stage not just that he's born into the family but he's got to be adopted into the same family he was born into any minister knows that's the placing of a son he had to be adopted into the family that he was born into could you imagine that but see that's the old testament teaching we see that but paul referred to it back in the book of ephesians so let's go to number nine the believer the position of a believer in 1955. this is in 1955 brother brown was talking about this now watch and now this epistle the letters of the ephesians was written to believers not to the outside world all right this is believers that's why i thought this afternoon first i'd test and see if there's a group yeah i giggled when i saw this i thought this afternoon first i'd test and see if there's a group of unbelievers i didn't do that okay i'm sorry and sinners then i couldn't speak this here but now seeing that it is for believers and the believers are present i thought it would be good if we let the believers see where he is are we that place now now try hard christians to understand that this day the message has been placing the believers and positionally placed if every believer in here was in their place everybody wake up just a minute if every believer in here was in their place well i'm so thankful that where the whole rows of wheelchairs set there's only about two or three left in here he had a prayer service before the night before if every believer knew their place a lady on the cot man with the crutches there would not be a feeble person in this building in the next 20 minutes i'm just everybody still believed brother branham was a prophet we believe what he said okay all right that's right if every man could simply find his place his or her sister that's you too in christ jesus what a difference it would make now i know he's discerning i feel your mind rolling fast now brother brown i know where i am you think you do if you do it'd be different let me read that one more time now i know filled your mind that means he was discerning their mind somebody thought now brother branham i know where i'm at he said you think you do see that's it if you did it would be different can i say that to lewis church if you did know your position it'd be different now let's read number 10 a hidden life in christ that one hurt too much i'll move on now after this child become of age now look he's still a child but if the child was reckless and never paid any attention and wasn't so interested in the father's work that child never become adopted to that family but if he was a correct child a good child and loved the work of his father and was interested that's kind of strange for you all today to be interested in what's being said and tried to do all he could do to progress look not his work not his work the father's work listen my father wrote the well i'm supposed to manifest him not me then the tudor brought that word to the father and there was what's called the placing of the son or as paul give us in galatians the adoption that we were predestinated into the adoption of children by jesus christ the adoption now what look now the same son that was born into a family could be adopted into the same family or placed in the same family or give a position in the family that he was born into all right so that's that's separated you got born again over here then you've got positionally placed in the body or in the family of god and i do believe that that is the work of the holy spirit today among the church is trying to place in the church positionally apostles teachers prophets and so forth as we've seen many false alarms and so forth moving amongst the people which only indicated that the real genuine adoption was at hand i believe it god has to place into the church that's the business of god not of man let's go to hear you him 1960. we'll read this one and it may stop right there here you have 1960. then how the father says you're proud of that son you know what happens when he's getting his schooling his training yet he might not be able to exercise all authority he hasn't got it yet he's still a son but he hasn't been placed now you ministers know where i'm what i'm getting to it placing of a son now look if that son proved to be a right kind of son loved the father's business stayed right with his instructions the father then on a certain day took that son out before the public set him up on a high place clothed him in a beautiful garment and had what they call the adoption of a son or placing a son positionally what he was they had a ceremony and then the father said this is my son i adopt him or place them positionally and if they had checks in those days that son's name on the check was just as good as the father's name because look because he was placed the son could fire who he wanted to he could hire who he wanted to he was in full possession of all the father had full possession now listen to this because we're going to get back to placing because we got to go into joshua and placing the people in in the land here you have listen to this one real quick then we'll get ready to take communion number 11. oh wait that's two number 11 i'm sorry okay uh well this is e38 so it's a continuation just keep scrolling it there we go placing of a sun take him out in a certain place have a ceremony before angels and place him positionally what he is in the body of christ then that person has the authority let me say this if you count me a fanatic from this not on that very same thing that i'm speaking of will be done there's a power put into the church and now it's coming in that the holy spirit will so anoint the people till they'll speak the word and it'll create right there we haven't seen powers like that coming into the church now i know it for a fact say unto this mountain be move don't doubt in your heart but believe what you've said you shall shall come to pass you can have what you have said the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the holy ghost comes into the church then critics mouths will be shut it'll be a short time jesus came right off the mountain went straight to calvary notice it won't last long but it'll be here wow we still believe brother brown was the problem okay now watch this real quick number 12 we'll read these next three and then we'll be then we'll be done how many likes to study the book of galatians oh i mean ephesians he was in ephesians now wednesday night we're going to go into the seal next sunday we're going into the positionally place in the church we'll probably get into it let's queue them down god has adopted us unto the sons and unto the sons we are sons by birth adopted positionally placed by the holy spirit look they were everyone hebrews when they crossed the river everybody okay with that they were the children of israel when they come to the river you're a child of god when you come to the river when they cross the river but look joshua divided the land and give each one his land according to the utterance of his mother at the birth where the holy spirit told her i talked about we talked about last night we'll get into it later on now watch let's go to number 13 1962. now we find that when joshua divided the inheritance to the people each person was placed positionally exactly the way these hebrew mothers named those children how they were placed in palestine just at their place asher gad not thali and each one judah everyone just placed in their position what a wonderful picture it gets us because it's a type of god what placing in the church himself every member every stone every place every christian to itself each one of us in our peculiar thank the lord all of us peculiar people say hallelujah each one of us in our peculiar way has a place in the house of god like solomon's temple when it was cut out all over the world you know that he ever studied the solomon's temple the bible said there was no hammer no sound of a hammer no sound of a saw brother gary can't happen he's got about four saws in his truck why because we need that but what happened was that was so perfect that god gave them the measurements and they cut them while they were out there in the field and they didn't miss it by none when they brought it to the temple it was just like a jigsaw puzzle they just put that thing together just like this and was not a sound of a hammer that was not a sound of a saw same thing with me and you now watch each one in a peculiar way all right we are ready let's go to verse let's go to number 14. this would be the last one get ready for communion i want to make a few comments for a second but he had to divide the lands and there was 12 tribes to divide it by now what if he had had some picks and pets what if he liked the tribe of god better than he liked the tribe of ephraim the tribe of joseph better than he did judah but he didn't do it that way he divided it according to the word revealed by the spirit he divided it according to tribes and notice he done it by the revelation by discernment by the discernment of god's spirit he did it each one of those hebrew mothers giving birth to those babies call their name and each one of their name has a meaning so every time those now remember like i said before you've got leah you've got leah you've got rachel and you've got some concubines mixed into all that to have all the 12 to 12 children but every time they were in labor pains and they screamed out reuben or gad god positionally placed them spiritually and then then who joshua had to discern by the spirit where to put them and why in the world did he it wasn't just coincidence that the two tribes once said hey we'll just stay over here on this side and half the tribal manasseh said we're going to stay on this side but now what we'll do is though we'll go into the land and help our brothers fight right but this is a lot of there's a lot of green grass out here for our cows there's a lot of stuff on this side that we'll keep and he took a prophet of god thank god for a prophet where brother brown said oh we know what that is that's the two tribes and the half tribe of manassas that's justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost because listen that type luther wesley and pentecost they couldn't come to adoption come on people they couldn't come to placing wasn't required right in that dispensation but there was a half tribe of manasseh that was right over the border that connected to that other half tribal manasseh showing that the holy ghost was going to take us on into the land and then positionally place everybody there oh god thank god he sent us a prophet to be able to tell us that and then we look at that and say like hattie wright did that ain't nothing but the truth luther and wesley and pentecost couldn't come to adoption they didn't have enough word to get them to adoption they ran this land but they couldn't go over into the promised land that half tribe of manasseh though went across the promised land and was able to connect back to the pentecostals and then the prophet of god the holy ghost brought them across the land and positionally placed them in the land and we'll talk about that when we when we get started next time let's let's stand to our feet and there's just a lot to adoption and placing i wanted to just kind of go through it but the lord i think this morning kind of backed me up a little bit and said no you need to talk about the placing because that's important now i want to ask you a question do you know your place do you know your position in god if you're born again it's required that you know your position because if the if the in type if the hebrew children that were born born from their mother church born again if you get born again somewhere down the line you've got to know where your place is and the problem is and we'll read it next week where we had manasseh or gad trying to put a little corn in in reuben's corn in reuben's field nope reuben had a position stay out of that i know i'm not a prophet i'm not going to try to be one but i am i believe in minister of the gospel so should you you should know where your position is at what you're doing you should know when you walk in the door and not be able not be not be what tossed about with every wind of doctrine amen because listen satan is here to do that he will do it that's his job but you know what it's god's job to protect his children and it's god's job listen you can't positionally place yourself amen you got to go back to your birth and let god place you through your birth that's the way the children the children did ruben didn't just say this is mine we're running across the river you know let's draw it i got this don't cross this line no joshua said okay from here to the river over so many hundred feet thousand feet whatever it is this is yours reuben gad this is yours over here and brother random i'll i'll read it next next week brother brown's talking about dipping your foot in oil and all the different ones had the different names and they were positionally placed right where god had put them and wants them and he said they're still in that position today they just don't know it they just do not know that they're in that position and not knowing in that position guess what they're waiting on me and you to get out of the way but who's got to see their position first me and you we got to see our position first before israel as a nation can get into their position so who's holding this rapture up oh it's just me and brother donnie and the sister back there okay well y'all pray for us three and um confession is good for the soul who's our biggest problem you no me all right you love the lord listen he's given something that the world does not have and listen we didn't separate ourselves god did god did and if the world don't know it then you probably need to go to praying if the world don't know you're different you need to get to praying amen first corinthians 11 we come to communion time and i'm sure glad we're starting taking communion and footwashing again because it is an ordinance but i just enjoy doing it because it makes you feel whole it makes you feel that you've done what god's told hey it's in the will we're doing what's in the will all right so let's read first corinthians verse chapter 11 verse 23. this is paul talking and paul by revelation was the one that was given the the commission to write this because he wasn't even in the upper room so he's given it by revelation and given it by revelation he's telling you exactly what's going on in the upper room for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take heed this is my body which is broken for you this due in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sup saying this cup is the new testament there's the new testament because the testator hadn't died yet but he was fixing to die that morning the next day in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sure the lord death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself that's kind of what we did today we examined ourselves to see where our position was see if we were in a position amen please folks we got to know where we're at we got to know who we are then we'll see a lot more healings and a lot more things going on amen wherefore who shall ever eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord now watch the body of the lord the bride but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not deserting the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep and if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat terry one for another and if any man hunger lady meet at home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i come let's have a moment of silent prayer the prophet of god tells us to clean yourself up and pray for your pastor so let's have a moment of silent prayer lord i pray that you bless the people here lord may as we go through this ordinance that we're going through lord that that truly the holy spirit will come and anoint us each one lord give us a powerful anointing lord that we can know lord that that we're doing the right thing your presence is felt and lord that we're going up that statue of a perfect man we're coming to that placing that adoption lord where we know what to do with the word when we're given lord i pray that you should be with each one and the furthermount of this service forgive us of our sins in jesus name amen the bible said he took the bread and he blessed it dear lord jesus this bread lord was made with holy hands not just some cracker or a loaf of bread that we buy off a shelf lord it's made by whoever and whatever but lord know it's been made by holy hands the way it should have been made and father now as we break this let's remember lord that your body hung on calvary for our sins and that body hung on calvary for our for our sicknesses lord in our shame and the things that we did lord and you took every bit of that into your bosom lord and you died and you released your life lord that it can come back on a set of believers and you gave us these ordinances lord that we should do until you come father so as we take this wine and we take this bread lord we pray that you sanctify the people that are taking it and bless us in jesus name amen you know it's it's interesting that the world don't when you tell people you take communion i came i came across one gentleman um just a couple months ago when i was getting i was getting my notary uh over at the courthouse in banks county and his name's tim harper and he's a really good guy super nice guy and we were talking about church and he said and he's methodist he said how do y'all take communion because he knows probably terrence and anna more than he does me but i've got to know him in the past few years but he said how do y'all take communion i said well we bake our own bread we don't buy that store we don't put it up overnight i'm gonna burn this when i get home i'll take a torch and i'll burn this where it will be unusable because you don't hold it over to the next day all right he said well that's wonderful he said now i'm gonna ask you he said what do y'all drink i said well tim i said we've never drank grape juice he said praise the lord he said somebody is doing it right because as a methodist i mean they take it like what we used to do with it we used to take and and mom and dad would cut it make it weaker grape juice right damn right mom the older people couldn't stand the grape juice boy they'd die if it drank this stuff wouldn't they so be careful if you never take communion with real wine be careful it's real but he said thank you for doing that he said that's the way it should be done see there's people caught in these denominations that just do what they that do what the denomination does and doesn't have a way out i told him i said well just come to church with us one time first sunday of every month we take communion i said you'll have wine and you'll have you'll have a real bread that's made by holy hands and that's some of the best wine no we wine drinkers but that is some of the best wine in the world because it's made with holy hands and it's made the right way the heavenly father we thank you for this wine lord it's been made lord by holy hands and also it's been looked over by somebody lord that just takes care of this wine and and helps it lord but it doesn't help it to get father it doesn't help it it's not going to get rank or or it's going to get better with age all that grape juice and the things of the world all that will rot and go away but this wine will just keep getting better and better so father as we partake of this wine lord may the holy spirit in each one of us lord get stronger and stronger and better and better as the days go on lord it will help us fight the devil and lord all his demons and spirits lord that come against us father we pray that as we take this lord communion that it's a promise lord that if we take it to you come lord that we'll see you and not see anything else lauren let us see you father in jesus name we pray amen yeah the whole world i mean they're they're groaning and waiting we didn't get to all that for the manifestation of the sons of god animals why do you think there's volcanoes why do you think there's tornadoes this whole world want to be delivered because it's not going to be in the millennium it's not going to be in the future home we're not going to have to worry about tornado drills anything like that it's just like we were talking the other day we don't know what it feels like not to have pain or worry or what we gonna do tomorrow how we gonna get to work how long we gonna have to work if somebody gonna get ill throw a book at me or kick me out that's something we fear or worry about every day but what about a day when number one you don't have a morning cause you don't wake up it's just day all the time and you don't have to worry about all that what a wonderful time it's what is something in store for us that we can't fathom we've just got to believe that god is going to do it for us but listen he's going to give us a little piece of it now because when we come to this adoption in placing i believe that the fire's going to fly i believe that god wouldn't have put us in a position if he didn't he put us all in a place and i believe that's where we're at that we can know what god wants done when he wants it done and it will yield ourself and let him have dominion over us just like it was in in the garden of eden it wasn't a it wasn't a line eating a rabbit or uh no that's something we're gonna talk about in the millennium that's not gonna happen in the millennium either the lime will lay down with the lamb we can't even fathom that it'd be led by a child a big old ferocious line that we would run from and brother brown said this morning i read in the book he said i wouldn't even trust being around one with a 30 odd six much less a sling that's what he's talking about david you know killed the lion and the bear he said he said i'd have a 30 out six i wouldn't have a sling he was telling the truth you know humanly but then something takes over and then what took over with brother brian i remember he walked through that field that time and the and the uh bull that had killed a person before was laying right there in his way and that bull got got up turned around charged him he said if i'd have had my gun i'd have shot him see he was a human but god took over i said bull stop go lay down it said the bull had you if you read it you'll see that the i could just see the bull the bull had this bewildered look on his face like where did that power come from never felt that power before except back in the garden of eden that's what we're coming to folks that's what we're coming to we must believe that the word of god promised it and listen we're built for this we're astronauts we're built for this pressure if you're not get born again that'll help it amen all right god bless you let's protect your communion thank you lord all right if you got your bibles turn the book of john while they're getting ready we'll have communion the ladies will go downstairs the men will stay up here like i've always said we need to be reverent sisters be reverent downstairs don't make a lot of noise children go outside if you need to go outside men if you're not taking foot washing you need to get born again just saying jesus said you have no part with me if you don't i'm just telling you what the bible says saint john verse 13 the supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of judah says carrot simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand and that he was come from god and went to god he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself he's fixing to be a servant that's what we just read the creator he created the cloth the water and the feet that he was going to wash yet he stooped down and listened and ain't like us because we take baths all the time think about them walking all through the brother brown explains it walking through the manure and through this and through the dust that water wasn't clean but god didn't mind because he said you need to do this till i come he rises from supper and laid apart inside his garment and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel where with he was girded then cometh he to simon peter and peter said unto him lord thust thou wash my feet jesus said what i do thou knowest not now but thou shall know hereafter peter said unto him thou shalt never now look how bold he was thou shall never wash my feet jesus said if i wash you not you have no part with me pretty blunt simon peter's saying the lord said not only my feet but my hands and my head wash me all jesus said unto him he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but his clean ever wit and you are clean but not all for he knew he would betray him therefore he said you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garment was set down again he said unto them know you what i have done to you you call me master and lord and you say well for so i am if i then your lord and master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for i have given you an example that you should do as i have done to you the god of heaven washing only brother branham could call him a foot wash flunky that's what he was the god of heaven but he did it what he did it for an example for us to do it for i've given you an example that you should do as i have done to you verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither is he that is sin greater he that is in him if you know these things happy happy are ye if you do them let's bow our heads dear lord thank you for this day that you give us lord we've been through every ordinance now to accept the last one the foot washing lord and i pray lord as as we wash each other's feet lord that we we see that you did that day lord several thousand years ago you you stooped down and you washed the disciples feet and you washed them with a towel and you sat down and then in john 17 you said lord i said father i pray that they be one as we are one lord i pray that as we wash the feet that we become closer together with our brothers lord but also closer together to you that you'll be given the preeminence and the obedience that we give that to you lord and not to the world father we ask you to speak with each one of us lord as we go in our separate ways be with the ones the

lord that you'll be with us lord and guide us until we come back together on wednesday night bless our pastor keep him strong be with each one lord the sick take care of the ones lord that are not
