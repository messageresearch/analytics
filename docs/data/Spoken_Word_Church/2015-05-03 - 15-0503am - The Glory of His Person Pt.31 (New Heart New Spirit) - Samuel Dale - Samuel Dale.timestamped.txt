[8:49] remember each one of those any other
[8:54] announcements Heavenly Father we thank
[8:57] you for being you
[9:00] because in doing that
[9:02] then all we got to do is find out who
[9:04] you
[9:05] are and the only way we can do that Lord
[9:08] is by the opening of your word to show
[9:11] yourself unto us because we're not
[9:13] capable of understanding things of life
[9:16] even as human Mortals to do the best
[9:19] that we can and we ask you father that
[9:22] you would just bless and guide each one
[9:24] of us now and as we talk about you that
[9:27] you would come on the scene to each one
[9:29] and speak to our hearts and our lives
[9:31] forgive our sins lead us by your grace
[9:34] remember the sick among us remember the
[9:36] promises you made Lord that you said you
[9:39] would send your word and heal us and
[9:41] Deliver Us from destruction so we Praise
[9:43] Your Great Name have your way now and we
[9:46] commit it all to you in Jesus name
[9:51] amen okay
[9:54] Revelations
[9:57] 1 verse 12 and I turn turned to see the
[9:59] voice of him that spake with me and
[10:02] being turned I saw seven golden
[10:04] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[10:06] seven candlesticks one like unto the son
[10:08] of man clothed with a garment down to
[10:11] the foot and G about the PS with a
[10:13] golden girdle and his head and his hairs
[10:15] were white like wool as white as snow
[10:18] and his eyes were as a flame of fire and
[10:21] his feet like undefined brce as if they
[10:23] were as if they burned in a furnace and
[10:26] his voice as the sound of many Waters
[10:30] all right now we go to Ezekiel where we
[10:33] were uh last Sunday and try to continue
[10:36] we didn't get to the point but we'll try
[10:38] to drop down to verse
[10:41] 24 in Ezekiel
[10:43] 36 Pharaoh will take you from among the
[10:47] Heathen and gather you out of all
[10:50] countries and will bring you into your
[10:52] own land then I will sprinkle clean
[10:56] water upon you and you shall be clean
[10:59] from all your filthiness and from all
[11:02] your Idols will I cleanse you a new
[11:05] heart also will I give the give you and
[11:08] a new spirit will I put within you and
[11:10] I'll take away the Stony heart out of
[11:12] your flesh and give you an heart of
[11:15] Flesh and I'll put my spirit within you
[11:17] and cause you to walk in my
[11:19] statutes and ye shall keep my judgments
[11:23] and do them and you shall dwell in the
[11:25] land that I give to your fathers and you
[11:28] shall be my my people and I will be your
[11:31] God you may be seated the Lord had his
[11:34] Blessing to the reading of the
[11:37] word now remember this is speaking
[11:42] to Israel we know that the promises and
[11:46] the things that were made to them and we
[11:50] see that that is now fulfilled what he
[11:54] promised there because we knew that
[11:57] Israel would be scattered to to the
[11:59] world and then it would you know would
[12:03] come back to the position to where in
[12:05] the end time that you know he said I'll
[12:10] take you from among the Heathen I'll
[12:13] gather you so we see Israel going back
[12:15] to the Homeland and and they've been
[12:17] back there and then I'll give you the
[12:18] land and I'll I'll do this and then he
[12:21] says I'll do and I'll put a new heart uh
[12:25] you
[12:26] know and a new spirit within you so
[12:29] that's speaking of the natural Israel
[12:32] and the promise that would come is
[12:35] coming to pass and shortly there from
[12:38] now won't be very long until they will
[12:40] actually experience this of the new
[12:43] heart the new spirit and the things
[12:45] after the Rapture of the church all
[12:48] right so this really speaking to Israel
[12:50] in the natural point but yet it's
[12:52] speaking to you and
[12:54] I in the spiritual point to understand
[12:58] of about the new birth and what it is
[13:01] and what transpires you know to you and
[13:04] I and taking us from the Heen and making
[13:07] us a people and bringing us to that and
[13:10] giving us a land which we don't want the
[13:13] land because it's not land that we're
[13:16] interested in we're not uh the
[13:18] Millennium is to the Jews even the you
[13:21] know the doing of the nation we be there
[13:24] we're there on a honeymoon and you know
[13:26] the things it's not that we uh you know
[13:32] we don't care about land this land is
[13:35] what we're talking about this
[13:37] inheritance of redemption the full Plan
[13:40] of Redemption which includes the
[13:42] Redemption of the body and see bringing
[13:45] us to that place but then showing us
[13:47] about the new heart and the new spirit
[13:49] now we'll get down to that in a minute
[13:52] and try to pick up the thought but
[13:55] trying to tie it back together of what
[13:58] we were talking talking about last
[14:01] Sunday and bringing it down to the the
[14:07] point of seeing Body Spirit soul and
[14:11] seeing where the new birth takes place
[14:13] amen it does not take place in your body
[14:16] because without the spirit it's dead
[14:19] it's just nothing all right it doesn't
[14:22] take place in your spirit now that's the
[14:25] thing that we're going to have to do a
[14:28] lot of things
[14:29] about and and I I realized and I know we
[14:32] were discussing it last night uh my wife
[14:36] and sister Trudy and I at the house you
[14:39] know it it has taken a long time for us
[14:43] to understand a lot of the things that
[14:47] we think we
[14:49] know now that's the best way of saying
[14:52] it we think we know all right see we
[14:56] thought as people that uh the new birth
[15:00] was just something happens to us
[15:04] something great takes place we repent of
[15:07] our sins we start living a better life
[15:10] we start doing things and you know and
[15:13] walking in that and even to find the
[15:16] message and begin to try to walk in the
[15:20] message and we thought we know we're
[15:23] born
[15:24] again
[15:25] well I hope that this little series
[15:29] point is beginning to uh kind of click a
[15:33] little bit with us that those things are
[15:35] not exactly right because you know it's
[15:39] the Realms we deal with and uh you get
[15:42] into your things of like well well what
[15:45] do you mean brother Dale I I used to be
[15:48] sad now I'm happy I used to I didn't go
[15:51] to church now I go to church I used to I
[15:54] wore clothes that was immoral and done
[15:57] thing and now I don't do him are are you
[15:59] telling me that I'm not
[16:06] saved well I'm telling you you can do
[16:08] every bit of that and not be saved right
[16:11] now that's the only way I I'm I'm not de
[16:14] christianizing
[16:15] nobody I I'm just trying to say it in
[16:18] the correct way that you can do every
[16:20] bit of that and still be
[16:22] lost well what am I depend upon you know
[16:26] what what is the the the thing what
[16:28] would I do you know I believe the
[16:31] message I I love the word I do and you
[16:35] could do every bit of that and still be
[16:38] lost I hope this is doning on us to
[16:41] where that we can see these things and
[16:44] then find out see as I've tried to
[16:46] emphasize a lot lately that you're not
[16:48] born again in your
[16:51] body you're not born again in your
[16:54] spirit amen because Satan can come into
[16:57] that spirit and impersonate everything
[17:00] you can have all kind of
[17:02] gifts you can do everything Paul said if
[17:05] you know it's in other words I give my
[17:07] life to be burn I do all of these things
[17:10] I I can do all great things have great
[17:13] signs and wonders
[17:15] right and have not the new
[17:18] birth what good am I amen right well you
[17:23] know you just make me feel like that
[17:25] that you're talking to me right well
[17:29] thank
[17:29] you I'm just not calling your
[17:33] name I'm talking to you because then I'm
[17:37] talking to myself and to anybody that
[17:40] listens as to know the Bible says make
[17:43] your calling an election what
[17:48] sure it says examine yourself to see
[17:53] whether you're in the faith or not right
[17:58] all right
[17:59] see then you say but but you've taken
[18:01] away brother Dale everything that I
[18:04] thought that I had my salvation based
[18:09] upon you
[18:11] know I done this I didn't do that I
[18:13] don't do that I got
[18:16] well have I told you the
[18:20] truth have we read what the prophet said
[18:23] about
[18:24] it to show these
[18:26] things right
[18:29] well all then it's not a point
[18:32] of me destroying
[18:36] anything it's the point of as a prophet
[18:40] said one day some how did he say about
[18:42] he said I'm not doing this to preach
[18:43] Doctrine right he said I'm doing this to
[18:46] straighten out
[18:47] Doctrine well I'm trying my best to get
[18:51] you and I to a basis of where that we
[18:53] can put our eternity based upon
[18:57] something that is is
[18:59] solid and not something that Satan can
[19:04] impersonate because he can impersonate
[19:06] all of the things the love the joy the
[19:08] peace the the thing he can impersonate
[19:11] every better that and you not be
[19:15] right the prophet say you can have what
[19:18] the genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit
[19:23] upon your
[19:25] spirit every day of your life and be
[19:27] just this devil
[19:31] possessed and still be
[19:33] lost but I thought the baptism was the
[19:40] Salvation well we've got a lot of
[19:42] scripture to we got to get lined up
[19:44] eventually amen you know the the Bible
[19:47] says you shall receive power after the
[19:51] Holy Ghost has come upon
[19:53] you so then there has to be a Holy Ghost
[19:56] and then a power right amen right that
[19:58] can come after the Holy Ghost comes amen
[20:02] all
[20:02] right and the prophet says what he says
[20:06] the Holy Ghost positions you in the
[20:10] body for the gifts and the things right
[20:14] but you can have all kind of gifts
[20:18] right and still be
[20:20] lost now that's a hard one to
[20:23] follow that God would allow those things
[20:26] to happen that way
[20:29] to try you and
[20:31] I to see whether we'll take the word
[20:35] irregardless of our feelings and our
[20:38] ideas our thoughts or no matter who
[20:41] tells us these
[20:43] things it's got to be a personal
[20:46] experience between you and God Amen to
[20:50] where that you'll know that's right and
[20:53] how can you know
[20:55] it you can only know it by the word
[20:58] that's right all right you can only know
[21:01] it by that all right so then trying to
[21:04] get you to think about it you're not
[21:07] born again in your
[21:08] body you're not born again in your
[21:13] spirit you're born again in your
[21:16] soul and the soul is the real you and
[21:19] that's who you
[21:20] are now these are very valuable because
[21:24] the Lord willing this afternoon I'll try
[21:26] to express
[21:28] to you what I see in the New
[21:31] Birth so I would invite you to at least
[21:35] get the message and listen to it if
[21:37] you're not going to be here this evening
[21:39] at least listen to this message because
[21:42] it'll be to me it it's one of the most
[21:47] uh
[21:48] valuable parts of the message that I've
[21:51] ever tried to bring all right now but
[21:57] listen
[21:59] by being a triun
[22:03] being you know Body Spirit
[22:06] Soul all right and being that triun
[22:10] being as to be you all the way you know
[22:15] your body is you your spirit is you your
[22:17] soul is you we were talking last night
[22:19] about something and you'll I believe
[22:21] it'll help you to catch this afternoon
[22:23] but you realize that the soul of an
[22:26] individual when God breathes into your
[22:29] nostrils the life that you come from the
[22:31] mom you know and and you're delivered
[22:34] and and he breathes into your nostrils
[22:37] the Breath of Life do you realize that
[22:39] that soul that you
[22:43] are until where you are today if
[22:46] you're
[22:50] 79 or 80
[22:54] something that soul is still being
[22:57] molded
[22:59] and made into being
[23:02] amen cuz that's really what you are
[23:06] right and it's took 75 years to get me
[23:10] where I'm at so there's not no need of
[23:13] being in a big
[23:15] hurry you know I'd love for it to get
[23:18] faster but maybe there still some more
[23:21] molding that needs to be done to bring
[23:24] us into that now I say that but I won't
[23:27] I don't want to continue that
[23:30] thought all right we talked about last
[23:34] Sunday the inside of the inside
[23:39] am to where that God doesn't just deal
[23:43] with our bodies he doesn't he has to go
[23:46] through the body come on now don't lose
[23:48] me in just saying whoa he boy he's he's
[23:51] missed it cuz it's got to go through the
[23:53] body it's got to go through the spirit
[23:55] well come on folks I'm trying to say
[23:58] time I'm trying to shorten down the
[24:01] thoughts instead of extending them so
[24:03] long you ought to have enough sense to
[24:05] be able to know what I'm talking
[24:08] about all right that's right that should
[24:11] be enough to anybody that that you know
[24:13] that I I know what I'm saying in the
[24:15] bases sure your salvation Works back out
[24:19] through your body it works back out
[24:21] through your spirit but it's working
[24:24] through those reals you remember the
[24:26] last quote last SU that we was using on
[24:28] that
[24:29] thought justification is the work of the
[24:32] Holy Spirit sanctification is the work
[24:34] of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is
[24:36] the holy spirit all right now see then
[24:40] that way looking at it in that form you
[24:43] see that all of those things you can be
[24:45] anointed of all of that and it be not
[24:48] the devil anointing you
[24:51] necessarily it's God anointing
[24:54] you you
[24:56] know
[24:58] now you say well that that's just so
[25:00] hard for me to understand how that God
[25:03] would anoint
[25:06] me on my spirit and me be lost that's
[25:10] right
[25:13] right
[25:15] well my wife picked it up last night and
[25:17] talking she knows what I've
[25:20] said for over 40
[25:24] years I've tried to explain something to
[25:27] you
[25:31] all
[25:37] right does the Holy Spirit go into your
[25:47] soul and what causes it to
[25:50] stop on some
[25:52] people and not go into their soul if
[25:55] you're going to believe it goes in
[25:59] you want to call it the
[26:00] sincerity you want to go to the lady
[26:03] feeding her baby to an alligator are you
[26:06] that sincere let's don't deal with
[26:09] sinceri and things there's got to be
[26:13] something wrong
[26:15] somewhere that causes things to happen
[26:19] so I would listen this afternoon the
[26:21] Lord willing all right but we're still
[26:24] on trying to understand see we're triun
[26:28] being we're Body Spirit and
[26:32] soul all right I have to explain this
[26:35] again because it always goes out and
[26:38] people misunderstand you in the brother
[26:40] bram's earlier Ministry he would
[26:43] basically teach that it would be Body
[26:47] Soul and Spirit he would put the center
[26:51] real as the spirit and he'd make the
[26:53] soul the second real so then when you
[26:55] get into Ezekiel
[26:58] we will refer to this again but you get
[27:00] into Ezekiel I give you a new heart a
[27:02] new spirit he said see there said you
[27:04] got a new
[27:10] soul and see what he's what he's saying
[27:13] is right but it's our understanding but
[27:16] then when the word opened to the prophet
[27:18] then after the opening of the seals and
[27:21] things he taught what
[27:23] Body Spirit Soul right
[27:28] all right now but he always gave body
[27:32] five
[27:33] senses see tastes F smell here he always
[27:36] gave the second realm of man no matter
[27:39] what he called it Soul or Spirit or
[27:42] whatever he always gave it five senses
[27:45] memory reason conscious affections and
[27:48] the cerim no matter what he called it he
[27:51] always gave it the one sense it's either
[27:53] Faith or doubt it's either God or the
[27:55] devil all right he didn't have to preach
[27:58] a great long message to
[28:02] explain he said what he meant and meant
[28:04] what he said and it was
[28:07] right but you that way you can use the
[28:10] quotes for whatever you want to use it
[28:13] for but I invite you sometimes to go
[28:16] into the Bible and study the word
[28:20] Spirit it does not definitely give you a
[28:23] definition from the word Spirit as to
[28:26] just take the l or reading off you've
[28:29] got to be able to figure out whether
[28:31] it's talking about the spirit of God or
[28:34] the spirit of man right yes sir right
[28:37] right because it doesn't give you a
[28:39] different definition for this one as to
[28:43] compared to this one right and then in
[28:46] the Bible it would speak of the heart of
[28:51] man and we know the heart of man is just
[28:53] a thumping
[28:54] gizzard you know pumping blood
[28:58] L say as a man thanketh in his
[29:00] heart well you don't think in your heart
[29:05] physically right but if you knew what
[29:08] that word heart is signifying at that
[29:10] time it's exactly right right because it
[29:14] is the heart the soul the part of
[29:19] man that is motivating us to cause us to
[29:22] think with our brain we'll try to divide
[29:25] that in just a minute with what the
[29:26] prophet is saying but watch now so
[29:30] you're not born again then in your
[29:33] body you're not born again in your
[29:37] spirit you're born again in your
[29:41] soul all right there's where the new
[29:44] birth takes place all the other things
[29:46] Satan can
[29:48] impersonate y right but he can not do
[29:52] the one part when he entered the human
[29:55] race back in the garden Drew The Serpent
[29:58] and the seed he was able to make an
[30:02] inroad into the human
[30:05] being causing the
[30:07] problems but yet he could still not
[30:10] cause that soul of Adam and Eve to be
[30:14] lost he could cause it to be that that
[30:17] it wouldn't come anymore like
[30:20] that and that he would have his inroad
[30:22] into the body and
[30:24] spirit and like we were talking last
[30:26] night about
[30:27] the uh you
[30:29] know say the Catholic church and their
[30:31] doing they say give me a child it's what
[30:33] s years old or something said 5 years
[30:36] old something said you can have it the
[30:37] rest of your life well I differ with
[30:39] them now because I believe the new birth
[30:41] will change things but I agree with them
[30:44] in the
[30:45] natural and they may stay 20 years in a
[30:48] Catholic church and get converted to a
[30:51] Baptist Church and go with that but they
[30:54] still got the same identical Doctrine
[30:57] they just don't kiss the Pope's toe no
[31:00] more they just think well I don't I
[31:02] don't want to do the hygiene part I
[31:05] don't want to kiss his
[31:06] toe so I'll just but I'll believe this
[31:09] but I believe the same
[31:11] thing all right because that's what
[31:14] they're doing and after what nearly
[31:17] 2,000 years of their
[31:20] teaching they've got a pretty good
[31:22] inroad into the human being that's right
[31:25] that has to be destroyed by
[31:28] the new birth right and only can be
[31:31] destroyed brother BR said I was looking
[31:34] at the other day he said the only way
[31:36] you can have any kinship to God is to be
[31:38] born
[31:39] again you know I know kinship in the
[31:42] natural to God and His beings all
[31:45] right but now there to save
[31:48] time brother brother says there's two
[31:51] forces in you one is working through
[31:55] your
[31:56] mind the other is working through your
[32:01] spirit you said but they're all together
[32:05] you're not listening to his
[32:09] definition he said with the the natural
[32:12] mind we serve the things of life and
[32:15] doings right and he said that cuts us
[32:17] off now I'm looking at that that's off
[32:19] the message Victory Day to world that
[32:22] there's two spiritual forces all right
[32:26] the very thing that he does he throws
[32:28] himself away from the spirit
[32:32] man that's within
[32:34] him yep by going to the Natural
[32:39] mind it goes
[32:42] away you got two forces you're battling
[32:46] it's in that Spirit realm but you're
[32:50] battling you you've read the message or
[32:52] heard the message the greatest battle
[32:54] ever fought and what did the prophet say
[32:56] God chose the heart the devil chose the
[32:59] mind all right see in your mind is where
[33:02] the battle is
[33:04] transpiring and right now you're sitting
[33:06] there I wonder what he's saying I don't
[33:08] know what he's saying I wish he'd hurry
[33:09] up cuz I'm hungry I don't know what
[33:11] we're going to eat for dinner but I
[33:13] guess we'll send a hubby out to get
[33:14] something it's just all kind of thoughts
[33:16] running through I'm sure I'm glad I'm
[33:18] not a
[33:20] prophet all right because what would you
[33:23] think if all of that was rebounding into
[33:25] your mind right
[33:27] you know you'd want to stop and say okay
[33:30] you're thinking this you're thinking
[33:31] that see I don't want that forget it but
[33:37] listen you're not born again in your
[33:39] body you're not born again in your
[33:41] spirit you're born again in your
[33:44] soul all right we've tried to explain
[33:47] over many many
[33:50] years
[33:52] that what happens in then the Soul is
[33:55] sealed in by the Holy Spirit
[33:57] Satan cannot get into
[34:00] there to make you lost all right but yet
[34:04] it can still work through your body and
[34:06] your spirit to make you no matter how
[34:08] religious you think you are and how
[34:11] great You Think You Are by the new birth
[34:14] he still has those two elements of body
[34:17] and spirit that he can work through to
[34:20] try to get you to doubt to reason to
[34:24] figure things out to to do all kind of
[34:27] things he can work through that and then
[34:31] it gives you a great understanding us to
[34:33] me
[34:34] anyway because I I I don't I know you
[34:37] don't think the way I but this is the
[34:38] way I think I I used to think well even
[34:41] in the Baptist I used to think well you
[34:43] know I'm born again I thought it was
[34:45] then
[34:47] but well why have I still got all these
[34:52] problems and you hear it in the message
[34:55] it's there same things you come on in
[34:57] the message and one day it was preached
[35:00] to us there's none good no not
[35:03] one and we just everyone was in that
[35:06] real that boy he beat on my toes today
[35:09] he really laid it on to me then the next
[35:11] service somebody come and preach that
[35:14] you're just as perfect as God Is by
[35:17] being in Jesus
[35:19] Christ and I thought
[35:22] okay but I got a
[35:25] problem cuz I read Paul that the things
[35:28] that I would I do
[35:33] not and see that Paul was having a
[35:38] struggle in
[35:40] life and he said then with this outward
[35:44] part of me I serve the law of the
[35:47] flesh but with the inward part I serve
[35:49] the law of God
[35:53] right that that gets in that brain and
[35:56] starts running around make you wonder
[35:59] what's going on but he was simply
[36:01] explaining a Christian
[36:04] right that we have a lot of
[36:07] problems and things to tempt us and lead
[36:10] us astray right right but it's not in
[36:14] that Soul because that soul is sealed in
[36:17] amen that's right all right but it's in
[36:19] that Spirit
[36:21] real that he's dealing with me in that
[36:24] he's causing my troubles then in the
[36:27] Bible would be
[36:28] right that his seed remaineth in me and
[36:31] I cannot sin exactly right but yet the
[36:33] scripture is right that I sin every
[36:37] day you see the Bible was put together
[36:40] then with understanding that didn't
[36:42] bother
[36:44] you no Brother D I just glad to yeah you
[36:47] was glad to just be able to Shout Scream
[36:49] and have a good time and when everything
[36:51] was going good and the preacher was
[36:53] really preaching some real good up
[36:54] toties you was up with it up toties and
[36:56] shouting Glory Hallelujah and going with
[36:58] it and holling amen but then when he
[37:00] started beating on your toes you
[37:02] start and you sire up and you start
[37:05] saying well you know you don't not be
[37:07] talking about me like that he donees
[37:09] call my name three
[37:14] times that didn't never bother
[37:18] you I like that's why I don't put my
[37:21] mind to
[37:22] anything you
[37:25] know and brother can tiar a car down
[37:27] Richard can TI a car part and put it
[37:29] back together you know it
[37:31] runs if I tiar it a part I don't even
[37:33] know where the parts at
[37:35] that you know I'd have to label every
[37:38] boat and put it
[37:39] back cuz if I didn't I wouldn't get it
[37:42] back together cuz I'm not going to put
[37:45] my mind to
[37:47] that that's why people say well you're a
[37:49] good Carpenter you just that you know I
[37:51] put my mind to that years ago I got
[37:54] tired of paying other people for doing
[37:56] things and then had go back and redo
[37:57] them so I started doing it
[38:00] myself well if you understand my point
[38:03] the only thing I want to put my mind to
[38:05] now is God's
[38:09] word that's the goal in my heart is
[38:12] God's word to understand God's word is
[38:16] right and to believe it and try to walk
[38:18] therein that's right we live we do we
[38:22] eat we do we work everything's fine but
[38:26] our one goal should
[38:28] be God's
[38:30] word the very importance of it now see
[38:35] then we got over to a point of thinking
[38:37] lincol trying to bring out who is it
[38:39] that does
[38:41] wrong who was it that Paul was saying
[38:44] was doing wrong at
[38:48] times and he's talking about
[38:51] himself the things I I would I do not
[38:54] right the things I do I would not
[38:59] it was just being honest brother brandom
[39:02] do you sin he said every day
[39:05] amen well the Bible said if you sin
[39:08] you're going to
[39:12] hell
[39:14] right cuz sin is
[39:17] unbelief all right so where was Satan's
[39:20] inroad Body
[39:23] Spirit and if something goes wrong in
[39:25] you and let's don't get it down to where
[39:28] that we're going to make it because
[39:29] we've figured this out now let's don't
[39:32] get it now though to the part that we
[39:33] say the devil made me do
[39:37] it brother Dale explained that all right
[39:40] I'm going to explain what the prophet
[39:42] says to make sure you don't try to go
[39:45] that way to say well I can't help
[39:49] it and that's just my
[39:51] spirit it ain't the real
[39:54] me so let's do with what brother Bram
[39:59] said he
[40:00] said Israel and the
[40:04] church he
[40:07] says the devil didn't come
[40:13] in he said you went out to
[40:16] him
[40:19] right now know I can read I got another
[40:22] one to where he says that that's
[40:25] referring to
[40:26] a lot of times as just those who hasn't
[40:29] crossed into the land yet so we we we we
[40:33] read but just remember you went out to
[40:37] him right just remember he says in the
[40:41] breach he said you went out to him he
[40:44] said because if he come in said he'd
[40:46] have to
[40:49] be like you if he gets into your soul
[40:54] he's going to have to be justified
[40:57] Sanctified and filled with the Holy
[40:59] Ghost so it's not in the
[41:04] soul right right amen cuz remember the
[41:07] Bible says the soul that sinth it shall
[41:09] die that's right let's just don't put it
[41:12] all say saying well I can't help
[41:15] it you know so I'll just put that as
[41:19] being in my spirit it might be a little
[41:23] deeper cuz if you're saying I can't help
[41:25] it and you're meaning that in the wrong
[41:27] way then I'm going to tell you if that's
[41:30] what's coming to you and you're thinking
[41:32] that way you are lost right because you
[41:35] would not be thinking that right amen
[41:38] you're not trying to get by with
[41:39] something that's it amen right we're
[41:43] trying to be honest and straight above
[41:46] board to live and be what all right so
[41:49] then it was not me I mean it was not the
[41:53] devil capable of coming into me no
[41:55] further than my soul I mean no further
[41:58] than my body and my
[42:01] spirit he can't come into my soul if I'm
[42:04] sealed in that's right cuz he's sealed
[42:06] out right but he can still has his
[42:09] inroad into that body and spirit to to
[42:12] make me think wrong and do
[42:16] wrong oh now there's a bad one see we we
[42:20] want to thinking is not too bad we we we
[42:23] kind of got where we can get by with
[42:25] that but if we go do it we'll say well
[42:27] that's what brother Dale said it was the
[42:29] devil in my
[42:31] spirit it might be the devil in your
[42:35] soul
[42:37] right because remember he's there until
[42:39] you're born again no matter what you
[42:42] think about it all right but you see
[42:44] what I was trying to bring out then
[42:46] Sunday you don't he you got to go out to
[42:49] him brother BR says that Holy Spirit is
[42:52] very
[42:53] shy he said if you grieve him he said
[42:56] he'll go out on a
[42:59] limb what a better way of expressing it
[43:02] he moves away from you in his
[43:07] presence and I can even go a long ways
[43:10] we're talking a lot a lot of things
[43:12] remember brother randam lost a gift for
[43:14] a long time because of something he
[43:16] didn't
[43:17] do you remember
[43:20] that it was pulled away from
[43:24] him but then it was brought back see all
[43:27] right so now watch then as we're trying
[43:31] to get to point of the message we'll get
[43:34] to Ezekiel in just a
[43:37] moment see then the Soul of
[43:40] you the
[43:43] soul is where the new birth takes place
[43:47] amen all right that's your being person
[43:50] who you are right and if you're
[43:53] listening you'll catch on real quick as
[43:55] I said it took 75 years to bring this
[43:58] being that's within me to a place right
[44:02] yeah now to show you what I'm talking
[44:04] about in the the the extent uh we don't
[44:08] try to make no age of accountability as
[44:10] a certain age but there is an age of
[44:12] accountability because it is different
[44:14] from different people somebody might be
[44:16] 80 years old in just the age of
[44:18] accountability because of their
[44:20] mentality right you know problems
[44:23] troubles but I believe that the brother
[44:26] said the most illiterate person could be
[44:28] saved now that's according to him you
[44:30] know all right but see that that
[44:34] part of you molding up through there is
[44:38] building a person within
[44:41] you that you
[44:44] are it starts making your nature your
[44:47] ways your things to be of what you are
[44:50] and by the time you reach the age of
[44:52] accountability see God is Not accounting
[44:55] that to you but then he starts
[44:57] accounting to you the record of life you
[45:00] know or what you're doing all
[45:03] right see he it's molding you amen into
[45:09] the person you are all right you can see
[45:13] I keep want to go to that okay that's
[45:14] this evening but all
[45:17] right but now what is a
[45:20] soul we read it from you must be born
[45:23] again paragraph 111
[45:26] he said the soul is
[45:28] you right you are a soul that's what you
[45:32] are right the word Soul means being
[45:35] person what you are what you're doing
[45:39] and you know what to understand the way
[45:42] we do then if I'm just a Christian in
[45:45] body and spirit by anointings then with
[45:48] inside of me can still be the devil in
[45:51] his nature and his ways and I've got
[45:54] everybody deceived but me
[45:59] I can preach the gospel I can do all
[46:02] kind of
[46:03] things and I tried to emphasize that in
[46:07] the last Sunday's message that you can
[46:09] have all kind of gifts and that's your
[46:11] problem you have gifts of doing you see
[46:15] things and all and that's your problem
[46:18] because you put that on I must be
[46:21] saved I love the
[46:24] Lord I want to go to
[46:27] church I want all these
[46:30] things and still be totally lost right
[46:34] remember the devil wants to go to church
[46:39] too and remember he was over according
[46:42] to doing he was the worship Angel you
[46:45] know he loves to sing he loves Good
[46:48] gospel music I don't think he likes rock
[46:51] and
[46:53] roll I don't know how anybody
[46:56] could because it beats the Daylights out
[46:59] of my brain that's right amen especially
[47:01] when I'm riding down the
[47:03] road and it's louder outside than it is
[47:07] you know in that car because if it was
[47:10] that loud in that car there's no way in
[47:11] a world that person could
[47:13] live right because it does it spreads
[47:16] out further all right but now think
[47:18] about it what is a
[47:22] soul it's the real you right
[47:26] you're a tri being Body Spirit Soul all
[47:30] right that doesn't mean that you're just
[47:32] a soul and a now your body spirit and
[47:35] soul to make you a triun being because
[47:38] your body and your spirit manifest
[47:42] what's inside of
[47:43] you but as I said now be careful because
[47:46] it can be a religious
[47:49] remember the unclean Spirit goes out of
[47:51] a man walketh in dry places seeketh rest
[47:54] come back finds a house swt in garish
[47:56] enters
[47:57] therein and the person is what a
[48:00] religious
[48:02] person
[48:04] right they don't go back to the world a
[48:07] lot of
[48:08] times they become preachers they become
[48:11] church
[48:13] people why because that's the
[48:18] deception everybody's deceived even
[48:21] they're deceived Eve thought she was
[48:24] right
[48:27] right now you explain that to me and I
[48:30] don't have to explain nothing
[48:32] else that a crazy woman could do what
[48:36] Eve done and think she's
[48:38] right but she did and she still thinks
[48:41] she's
[48:43] right right cuz he said the
[48:45] church right she still thinks she's
[48:48] right right all right now so watch what
[48:52] we're getting
[48:54] at
[48:56] brother randam he gets to souls in
[48:58] prison if you want to go ahead and pull
[49:00] number six we'll read just a little
[49:06] bit CU we want to get these to where you
[49:08] make sure and understand it paragraph 44
[49:11] and what does he
[49:13] say he says that Soul that's in
[49:17] there see that soul is what God is
[49:20] working
[49:22] on you said no I was sitting in the Pew
[49:25] and I heard heard him I heard the
[49:27] preacher well hey come on as I said
[49:29] while ago don't be
[49:33] right at least be sensible to think I'll
[49:36] be in some great
[49:39] Revelation you it's going to come
[49:40] through your hearing right and it's
[49:43] going to come through your memory reason
[49:44] conscience right but where's the main
[49:47] part it's supposed to go to right see
[49:50] you're going to find out what I said
[49:51] last week you're going to find out
[49:54] eventually that you're not justified and
[49:56] Sanctified in your body and
[50:01] spirit you got to have it on the inside
[50:03] and let it work out right because if it
[50:07] is you could just be Sanctified on your
[50:09] body and spirit and it wouldn't be worth
[50:11] nothing you can live a good life but is
[50:14] that worth anything that's
[50:17] right right that's better than living a
[50:20] bad one yeah but but what that soul is
[50:24] what God is working on if you can only
[50:26] get that
[50:28] nature now we're going to hit that heavy
[50:30] this evening but see that
[50:34] Spirit now you jump back say now he said
[50:38] Spirit he said Soul now he said Spirit
[50:41] well sure it works back out through your
[50:44] spirit correct amen but it's the center
[50:48] part of you that God is working
[50:50] on to agree with him watch then that
[50:53] nature dies
[50:57] Y what did you sold
[51:00] ey or was it the nature of it
[51:08] right you see there's where that you
[51:11] hold on to your original thoughts you
[51:13] got a
[51:15] problem the nature and the love of the
[51:18] world dies now he's putting it to what
[51:21] it
[51:22] is and the things of the world is dead
[51:25] see
[51:26] because if you love the world the things
[51:27] of the world the love of God is not in
[51:29] you and a man must be born again so this
[51:33] Nature has to
[51:36] die and the nature of God comes and
[51:39] lives in you right he's dealing with
[51:43] nature right and God is the only thing
[51:46] there is that never did begin or never
[51:49] can end see there's your secret of
[51:51] eternal
[51:52] life all right but look at the next one
[51:55] which is number seven this is taken from
[51:57] paragraph
[51:58] 36 of the souls that are in
[52:02] prison the soul of man is not the body
[52:04] it's the soul see the soul is something
[52:07] that's watch him the nature of the
[52:09] spirit okay because my spirit will
[52:12] display what's inside of me irregardless
[52:16] of whether I'm lost or
[52:19] saved right right right my spirit
[52:22] displays what's inside of me even if I'm
[52:25] lost are saved right all right because
[52:28] there's the nature part the it's the
[52:32] nature of the spirit and then when the
[52:35] nature of a man now watch when he said
[52:38] we are dead the scripture plainly tells
[52:40] us that we're dead and our lives are HID
[52:43] in God through Christ sealed are by the
[52:46] Holy Spirit right Amen to
[52:50] that watch now it wasn't that your body
[52:54] died
[52:56] right it wasn't your spirit
[53:02] died it was the nature of your spirit
[53:06] whatever is motivating it amen
[53:10] right died see the nature which is the
[53:15] soul amen all right
[53:19] now but now here's where it gets
[53:22] confusing to
[53:23] mankind because you go back to the old
[53:26] tapes and you use that soul and nature
[53:30] and things and you'll bring it to the
[53:32] second realm of
[53:36] mankind goes in the old quotes if you
[53:39] use soul and if your mind is still
[53:41] leaning to that Soul as being the second
[53:44] part of you then look where you're
[53:48] at you see why did I try to do that with
[53:52] you to get you to think
[53:56] about
[53:57] it see if you're still dealing with soul
[54:00] as
[54:02] being the second
[54:06] Rim as you would
[54:08] use then you're going to get a New
[54:13] Soul you're going to get this you're
[54:15] going to get that brother got on to me
[54:17] about saying a scripture which maybe I
[54:20] shouldn't
[54:22] say but I don't don't mean it to use it
[54:26] wrong cuz that's what he accused me of
[54:28] he said don't use scripture wrong I
[54:29] wasn't using it wrong the original
[54:32] translation where it says that a
[54:35] double-minded man is unstable in all of
[54:38] his ways you know what the original
[54:42] says original says a two soul
[54:46] man that's original translation
[54:51] you double-minded man means two Soul Man
[54:54] well see he thought I was throwing in
[54:55] against the two Soul people I wasn't
[54:58] doing
[54:59] that I was saying what truth
[55:02] is a double-minded man is unstable
[55:05] that's right if you got two things in
[55:07] your soul leading you at the same time
[55:10] you got
[55:15] problems so you are
[55:17] unstable the Bible's right all right but
[55:21] watch now watch him here as he explains
[55:24] it because see under the old to Soul
[55:27] Doctrine they said your soul is the
[55:29] nature of the spirit well okay that's
[55:31] fine if you know how to place it but if
[55:34] you're placing it as just the other part
[55:37] of using it
[55:38] wrong and see when I quoted this to a
[55:41] brother standing in front of the old
[55:43] Armory up at Jeffersonville where the
[55:45] spoken word was this is what he said cuz
[55:48] I quoted him this quote see brother
[55:50] Brown said the nature of your soul is
[55:53] God if you're born again
[55:58] the nature of your soul is God if you're
[55:59] born
[56:01] again if it's not it's of the
[56:05] world the brother he see because he
[56:08] hooked in on that Soul nature so much
[56:10] till he said how can a nature have a
[56:12] nature
[56:15] amen I said why don't you argue with a
[56:17] prophet cuz I ain't going to talk to you
[56:20] about
[56:21] it there was no need of us discussing it
[56:25] because see his mind was still Soul as
[56:29] nature not bringing it up as so as the
[56:32] inner being and bringing the nature of
[56:35] God within
[56:37] you because that is the new birth we'll
[56:40] get to it this evening is when the
[56:42] nature of God comes into
[56:44] you all right but see he
[56:47] says and watch the nature of soul is God
[56:51] if you're born again if it's not it's of
[56:53] the world so what's the nature of your
[56:55] soul
[56:57] today God if you're born again it's of
[57:00] God if you're not it's the devil right
[57:04] so one nature or the other one's leading
[57:06] us right right okay look anything to
[57:12] begin has an end so therefore the only
[57:13] way that you can have eternal life is to
[57:16] have a life that never did begin and
[57:17] then your life did begin when you were
[57:21] born your nature your being your soul
[57:25] when God breathed the breath of life
[57:26] into your nostrils and you became a
[57:29] living Soul then you begin then all
[57:33] right so
[57:35] then to understand
[57:39] then that the new birth is not in your
[57:41] body right that the new birth is not in
[57:44] your spirit that's right it will work
[57:47] back out through your body and spirit
[57:52] yes but turn it around and say it this
[57:55] way the devil is in there that works
[57:59] back out through your body and spirit
[58:01] too all right and you know what then
[58:04] that devil can be in there can be a
[58:06] religious devil and your body and spirit
[58:09] will be of a religious
[58:12] nature that's right
[58:18] okay so one of the others ruling us
[58:20] today
[58:22] amen your soul is either born born again
[58:25] or it's not born
[58:26] again we can't put it on whether we go
[58:29] to church whether we're good whether we
[58:31] do a PIR tide where we we do all of
[58:34] these things you know right
[58:38] uh you can't put it on all that you got
[58:42] one thing to put it
[58:45] on and we got to get to that this
[58:47] evening okay so we'll try to run real
[58:50] fast now let's read this let's go back
[58:52] and read Ezekiel all right go ahead and
[58:54] put pull up number eight brother let's
[58:55] read Ezekiel and get this point because
[58:58] to
[58:59] me this is what SEALs up the
[59:03] point you know I love to uh read the
[59:07] Bible and I love to read it and watch
[59:11] what it's
[59:14] saying do you
[59:17] believe that in explaining The
[59:22] Parables of the seed and
[59:26] things do you
[59:29] believe that if you don't understand the
[59:32] parable of the
[59:34] seed you cannot understand any other
[59:49] Parable maybe you ought to read lot how
[59:52] many of you read The Parables lately
[59:59] would it throw you for a loop if I said
[1:00:01] Jesus said
[1:00:07] that you know what a lot of people say
[1:00:10] he never said
[1:00:13] it well we'll read it this
[1:00:18] afternoon that Jesus said if you don't
[1:00:20] understand the parable of the SE of the
[1:00:22] seed you cannot understand
[1:00:25] any of The
[1:00:33] Parables
[1:00:35] okay now watch Ezekiel we're going to 36
[1:00:41] 26 a new heart also will I give you and
[1:00:46] a new spirit will I put within you and
[1:00:49] I'll take away the Stony heart out of
[1:00:51] your flesh and give you a heart of Flesh
[1:00:57] now according to that God is in a great
[1:01:01] business of heart
[1:01:09] transplants what does that
[1:01:14] mean a new heart also will I give
[1:01:18] you and a new spirit I'll put within
[1:01:23] you
[1:01:25] well that's a good P that makes a good
[1:01:28] person he's got a new heart he's got a
[1:01:30] new
[1:01:34] spirit
[1:01:36] right I'll take away your Stony
[1:01:40] heart out of your
[1:01:43] flesh and I'll give your heart of
[1:01:49] Flesh
[1:01:50] well we're going he GNA take out my
[1:01:53] heart because it's heart he going to put
[1:01:55] in one that's soft now that's not
[1:01:58] exactly the story
[1:02:02] right this is talking about the New
[1:02:11] Birth he'll take away your heart he
[1:02:13] doesn't take your heart
[1:02:17] out he doesn't give you a new
[1:02:21] heart the heart of man is the center of
[1:02:24] man no matter where it's placed at
[1:02:27] because a heart of a seed is always the
[1:02:28] center of the seed that's not the it can
[1:02:31] be all set in the the
[1:02:35] doings but he's not talking about a
[1:02:38] heart transplant to take out your heart
[1:02:40] and put in a heart
[1:02:42] right it's a working upon your nature of
[1:02:46] your way of what you
[1:02:50] are because the word heart is the word
[1:02:53] soul amen okay so as a man thanth in his
[1:02:58] heart you don't think with the physical
[1:03:00] thumping gizzard right but brother Ron
[1:03:04] said I love
[1:03:06] it because it says you think with your
[1:03:09] heart you remember that he said the man
[1:03:13] said well you can't think with your
[1:03:14] heart you think with your brain he said
[1:03:17] no no the Bible don't say
[1:03:21] that you don't think with your brain
[1:03:26] your brain is just a
[1:03:28] computer you think with your
[1:03:32] soul you don't see with your
[1:03:37] eye
[1:03:39] right well I do I look and see but
[1:03:42] that's not the point there something
[1:03:44] else got to make that
[1:03:47] work not the
[1:03:49] eyeball there something else in that
[1:03:51] intelligence that transmits the images
[1:03:53] and does those things to make it come
[1:03:56] out do you see the what you're looking
[1:03:58] at all right but I give you a new
[1:04:03] heart I'll take away your Stony
[1:04:07] heart right just think of the word heart
[1:04:10] is being
[1:04:12] soul and not thinking that he'll take
[1:04:14] out your soul and give you a New
[1:04:20] Soul why don't you work on the nature of
[1:04:23] it and just let that be what it
[1:04:27] did see the nature of our soul is
[1:04:30] worldly that's what we just
[1:04:34] read that's what the prophet said if you
[1:04:36] lost the nature of your soul is of the
[1:04:39] world right if you're born again the
[1:04:41] nature of your soul is God so then he
[1:04:43] did take out the old nature Stony ways
[1:04:49] thoughts there's a couple of messages I
[1:04:51] wish you would listen cuz I'm not going
[1:04:52] to be able to get to them today but I
[1:04:55] wish you
[1:04:56] would listen to these two tapes why some
[1:05:00] people can't keep the
[1:05:04] victory all right that's preached in
[1:05:07] 1957
[1:05:12] 324 listen to what does it take to make
[1:05:15] a Christian
[1:05:19] Life preach in
[1:05:23] 1957
[1:05:24] uh
[1:05:26] 113 listen to the
[1:05:30] impersonation of
[1:05:33] Christianity as three
[1:05:35] messages that if you'll listen to them
[1:05:39] you'll hear him explain in
[1:05:42] Ezekiel that great ly did you get them
[1:05:45] the impersonation of Christianity
[1:05:49] 57120 the morning
[1:05:51] service all right
[1:05:56] what does it take to make a Christian
[1:05:59] Life
[1:06:03] 57113 there is another one there is two
[1:06:06] of those impersonation of Christianity
[1:06:09] I'm pretty sure the other one is why
[1:06:11] some people can't keep the
[1:06:14] victory all right he's explaining
[1:06:18] Ezekiel all right
[1:06:21] now I give you a new heart
[1:06:27] and a new spirit will I put within
[1:06:30] you now does that mean it doesn't mean
[1:06:34] to take the heart out and put another
[1:06:35] heart so it doesn't mean to take the
[1:06:38] spirit out and put another
[1:06:40] Spirit that's why people are concerned
[1:06:42] about it you remember when they first
[1:06:45] started doing the heart
[1:06:47] transplants all right back in the 60s
[1:06:50] when it was in there and the people of
[1:06:52] this message said I ain't no way in the
[1:06:55] world I'm going to let them take my
[1:06:56] heart out and put another heart in cuz I
[1:06:58] won't be the same
[1:07:03] person you remember
[1:07:05] that did you take out my heart you put
[1:07:09] another heart in I won't be the same
[1:07:12] person I'll be the person that my heart
[1:07:15] comes
[1:07:19] from all
[1:07:21] right
[1:07:22] now
[1:07:24] they've even put in mechanical
[1:07:27] hearts and people lived a while right
[1:07:31] one guy live what was almost a year a
[1:07:33] little over a year the one of them that
[1:07:34] they put the mechanical heart in well
[1:07:37] now who was he during all that
[1:07:41] time his
[1:07:44] nature his heart went a garbage
[1:07:49] can
[1:07:51] right who was he
[1:07:54] that's why I've always said hey I'd love
[1:07:57] to have a brain
[1:07:59] transplant it wouldn't bother me to
[1:08:01] think who am
[1:08:04] I because there's a whole lot more to it
[1:08:07] than just your
[1:08:08] brain that's just a recording mechanisms
[1:08:11] and Thing If It took your brain out put
[1:08:13] another
[1:08:14] brain see we think we'd lose every bit
[1:08:17] of our
[1:08:19] memory come
[1:08:21] on that's like I went to get my cell
[1:08:24] phone got a new one you know and the
[1:08:26] kids told me and said well it save us a
[1:08:28] lot of trouble running in all the
[1:08:29] numbers if you'll just take the phone in
[1:08:31] and let them have it so I took the phone
[1:08:33] in I gave it to them you know what they
[1:08:34] took the card out of my old phone the
[1:08:36] SIM card and they took it and put it
[1:08:38] through a device and run it back through
[1:08:40] and when he handed my phone I had all my
[1:08:41] numbers reserved you
[1:08:44] know but see what we think that you put
[1:08:47] in that and and you lose all your
[1:08:49] numbers you would if it wasn't on the
[1:08:51] SIM
[1:08:52] card but see that's what we
[1:08:56] think a new heart and a new
[1:09:01] spirit well it don't mean to give you a
[1:09:03] new
[1:09:04] spirit why don't you just take it to
[1:09:07] words I said that your soul would be
[1:09:09] your your heart would be your soul and
[1:09:12] and he would begin to work on
[1:09:16] you all
[1:09:20] right justification starts a work in the
[1:09:23] Holy Spirit Spirit of the holy spirit in
[1:09:25] your soul sanctification starts the work
[1:09:28] of the holy spirit in your soul working
[1:09:31] on the nature of it if you want to bring
[1:09:33] those words in but not taking the soul
[1:09:36] out and throwing it
[1:09:39] away it's just working on the nature of
[1:09:42] it to transmit it to God making it a
[1:09:47] soft heart mellow you down working upon
[1:09:51] your meanness and hatefulness and things
[1:09:53] and starts mellowing you
[1:09:56] down well he gives you a new
[1:10:01] spirit now see here's where I'm glad
[1:10:03] that we had a
[1:10:07] prophet because this is his
[1:10:11] definition he said you get a new heart
[1:10:13] you get a new spirit you'll hear it if
[1:10:16] you listen to them messages he said you
[1:10:19] get new
[1:10:22] desires
[1:10:24] see where you where once you desire to
[1:10:26] drink to crous to do things and and all
[1:10:30] you get a new desire you don't want to
[1:10:33] do those things
[1:10:36] again you want to go to church you want
[1:10:38] to Fellowship you want to be with people
[1:10:40] of like Precious
[1:10:42] Faith all
[1:10:44] right because there something happening
[1:10:47] to your
[1:10:49] nature of that being that's within you
[1:10:57] right remember you're not born again
[1:10:58] your body not born again your spirit
[1:11:01] you're born again in your soul so it's
[1:11:03] not the soul I mean it's not the body
[1:11:04] and the spirit that gets
[1:11:06] Justified the justification is working
[1:11:09] on the inward part of you in the
[1:11:11] soul the sanctification is driving the
[1:11:14] unclean Spirit
[1:11:17] out hey I've been at this 40 something
[1:11:20] 50 years
[1:11:21] AR so don't think this is just some new
[1:11:24] doctrine and I read about his brother so
[1:11:25] and so they come up with this I don't
[1:11:28] read about so and so I don't listen to
[1:11:30] so and
[1:11:32] so I study God's word if I hear somebody
[1:11:35] preached on these items I will do the
[1:11:38] best I can to get their messages and
[1:11:40] listen to them with an Earnest heart as
[1:11:43] to not be critical of them because I

[1:12:15] and a new spirit will I put within you
[1:12:18] and I take away the Stony heart out of

[1:12:49] people can't keep the victory now if you
[1:12:51] listen to these others I gave you and
[1:12:53] listen to this Mage yes what we need
[1:12:55] today is
[1:12:57] experiences of the new birth wonderful
[1:13:00] start now I want you to watch the order
[1:13:03] that Ezekiel brought it in he said I
[1:13:05] give you a new heart and I give you a
[1:13:07] new spirit and I put my spirit in you I
[1:13:10] want you to watch there stre of it a new
[1:13:14] heart I'll take the old Stony heart away
[1:13:18] that's that old different heart that you
[1:13:21] have you know meanness arrogance
[1:13:24] hate and I give you a new what
[1:13:29] spirit and many times there's been
[1:13:32] terrible been a terrible mistake the
[1:13:35] people has thought sometimes that that
[1:13:38] new spirit was the Holy
[1:13:43] Spirit but it isn't it's a new
[1:13:47] spirit it's not on this one maybe well I
[1:13:49] guess it is you can't even get along
[1:13:51] with with each other with that old
[1:13:53] spirit all right so you'll hear that so
[1:13:55] go ahead but it's a new spirit God give
[1:13:57] you a new spirit why you couldn't even
[1:13:59] get along with yourself with your old
[1:14:02] Spirit right how you going to get along
[1:14:05] with the Holy
[1:14:06] Ghost God had to give you a new spirit
[1:14:09] so you could get along with the Holy
[1:14:11] with his spirit and sometimes people a
[1:14:14] new heart a new flesh so you will
[1:14:18] receive it then a new spirit in that
[1:14:20] heart and then I'll put my spirit in
[1:14:22] that you see the new heart new spirit my
[1:14:25] spirit three things all right amen give
[1:14:29] you a new heart and a new spirit he said
[1:14:32] there's where especially the
[1:14:33] Pentecostals you hear him saying this on
[1:14:36] the messages I ask you listen to he said
[1:14:38] there's where the Pentecost was made
[1:14:39] their biggest
[1:14:41] mistake he said because they thought
[1:14:43] they got that new
[1:14:46] spirit well I say it's the biggest
[1:14:48] mistake for all of us because see I was
[1:14:51] a sinner
[1:14:54] you know I was out in the
[1:14:57] world and I went to The Altar and asked
[1:15:00] God to forgive my
[1:15:03] sins and he took away that old hateful
[1:15:07] arrogant
[1:15:10] attitude and if you'd ever known me you
[1:15:12] would have known I didn't have a real
[1:15:14] bad one that's not bragging that's facts
[1:15:17] I don't have to brag I tell it like it
[1:15:21] is it's not bragging that I so good
[1:15:23] that's why I've always tried to tell you
[1:15:25] people think it's because it's so living
[1:15:27] so good and doing you don't drink you
[1:15:28] don't smoke well I didn't do that was I
[1:15:29] saved the whole
[1:15:32] time no mainly because I couldn't afford
[1:15:37] it but see other people put their
[1:15:40] desires and things above what their
[1:15:42] flesh was and they went out and dranked
[1:15:44] it and then took the bread off the table
[1:15:46] from the kids and the clothes off their
[1:15:48] bodies and dranked it up
[1:15:52] and I I just always had a good nature
[1:15:54] about me that I
[1:15:56] didn't that wasn't in the
[1:15:59] problem my kids my wife and my family
[1:16:02] got first that's why my wife didn't
[1:16:05] work you know the story I told her she
[1:16:08] could either work and I'd stay at home
[1:16:09] with the kids or I'd you
[1:16:11] know I'd stay with the kids let her work
[1:16:14] whatever either which way or she could
[1:16:15] stay with them she had her
[1:16:19] choice why because I wanted my kids
[1:16:21] raised with a good atmosphere here and
[1:16:24] doing I didn't want them to have to be
[1:16:25] sent out every day to somebody else that
[1:16:28] does them have you read this up in
[1:16:30] gainful other day where they they've got
[1:16:32] the case started where the the little
[1:16:35] child started about four years old I
[1:16:37] think it was and they were selling her
[1:16:40] body to people and they were supposed to
[1:16:42] been taking care of
[1:16:45] her well they gave her life in about 80
[1:16:49] years I think so I don't think she's
[1:16:52] going to get out
[1:16:54] in my way of thinking I'd rather do that
[1:16:57] than to kill her because she can at
[1:17:01] least repent to God somewhere down the
[1:17:02] road and maybe he'd save her but I don't
[1:17:06] believe in in killing people cuz I
[1:17:09] believe the longer you live with your
[1:17:11] problems is worse than killing you
[1:17:13] killing you is a
[1:17:15] shortcut right that's just a you don't
[1:17:18] have to worry about it no more that's
[1:17:20] just brother Dale okay but now think
[1:17:23] about
[1:17:25] it I take
[1:17:29] away your Stony
[1:17:31] heart I'll mellow you
[1:17:34] down I'll bring you to a place that you
[1:17:37] know you can get along with people and
[1:17:41] things and I give you a new spirit which
[1:17:43] is a new
[1:17:44] desires and things and you want to go to
[1:17:47] church you want to do
[1:17:48] right but the prophet said there's where
[1:17:51] the mistake is that people thinks that
[1:17:52] is the Holy Spirit the new birth he said
[1:17:55] that's not
[1:17:56] true now you hear him in these messages
[1:17:59] I ask you to listen to you'll hear him
[1:18:00] say those things over and over and
[1:18:05] over but then he says then I put my
[1:18:08] spirit in you he said there's the Holy
[1:18:11] Spirit but you know the holy spirit's
[1:18:13] not going to come into you unless the
[1:18:16] Stony heart is gone and unless you've
[1:18:19] got a new nature upon that Spirit
[1:18:21] controlling and leading
[1:18:26] you're not going to get the the new
[1:18:29] birth that's why the prophet says that's
[1:18:32] why there's not so many new
[1:18:35] births I'm honest now I'm that's right I
[1:18:39] wish people wouldn't take me wrong and
[1:18:40] just take me what I
[1:18:44] say what is the problem with the people
[1:18:46] of this
[1:18:50] message they won't listen to you
[1:18:53] reading the scriptures let alone the
[1:18:55] prophet's message to
[1:18:57] them but yet they claim the prophet was
[1:18:59] a
[1:19:00] prophet if I'm going to believe him to
[1:19:02] be a prophet I'm going to try my best to
[1:19:04] stay what he
[1:19:06] said and when he says things that don't
[1:19:09] sound right according to me I'm going to
[1:19:11] know for sure there's something wrong
[1:19:13] with
[1:19:16] me when he says and we we won't do it
[1:19:20] this today but we're going to have to
[1:19:21] get to it because there's some things
[1:19:23] I've got to try to answer to the B the
[1:19:25] prophet say you're born again and then
[1:19:28] baptized into the
[1:19:33] body well see that's contrary to most
[1:19:35] people's
[1:19:39] thinking but so is it contrary to most
[1:19:42] people thinking that you're not born
[1:19:44] again in your body and
[1:19:46] spirit you're born again in your
[1:19:49] soul that justification and
[1:19:51] sanctification is a work of the Holy
[1:19:53] Spirit within the soul of the individual
[1:19:55] to bring the individual to the place
[1:19:57] read the future home you we just went
[1:19:59] through it to where that the life of God
[1:20:02] can come into you but he can't come in
[1:20:05] when there's anything left right
[1:20:10] amen that's why I love to read the word
[1:20:12] of
[1:20:14] God you ever noticed in The
[1:20:18] Parables one of them says they
[1:20:20] understood it one of them says they
[1:20:23] received it one of them says they keep
[1:20:27] it the three different times that it's
[1:20:30] told Matthew Mark and Luke of The
[1:20:35] Parables but we think that's not
[1:20:38] important well we'll read this evening
[1:20:41] where brother brandham I mean where the
[1:20:42] Bible says that if you don't understand
[1:20:45] this parable of the
[1:20:48] seed you cannot understand the other
[1:20:51] parables
[1:20:53] I didn't write that the Holy Spirit did
[1:20:56] through the words of the Lord
[1:20:59] Jesus but do you know he said
[1:21:05] that or you like some who said brother
[1:21:08] Dale said so and so said I'd say no
[1:21:10] brother Rand didn't say that said then
[1:21:12] he just pull the quote and lay it out
[1:21:15] and read
[1:21:17] it well I thought that's what we
[1:21:20] supposed to be let stand come on
[1:21:22] musicians L anybody has a need but what
[1:21:27] is the
[1:21:28] point of the
[1:21:32] message the new birth doesn't come in
[1:21:34] your body your spirit is in your soul to
[1:21:37] make you a new creature it doesn't make
[1:21:40] you a new creature in Christ Jesus to
[1:21:42] have an anointing upon your spirit and
[1:21:45] it be the genuine anointing of the Holy
[1:21:48] Spirit does not make you a new
[1:21:51] creation
[1:21:56] it may work upon the spirit part of you
[1:21:58] to change things cuz I believe that I
[1:22:01] believe that there's a lot of people
[1:22:03] today sitting in the churches even the
[1:22:06] people of this message that have come no
[1:22:08] further than justification and
[1:22:09] sanctification and they've got to that
[1:22:11] new spirit part of
[1:22:14] them and they're not calling upon God to
[1:22:16] bring them to I'll put my spirit within
[1:22:19] you they're just taking their feelings
[1:22:22] around ideas or thoughts or loves or
[1:22:25] Joys or happiness and believing
[1:22:27] everything the prophet
[1:22:29] said well why don't you believe
[1:22:31] everything he
[1:22:34] said when the prophet says you
[1:22:37] misunderstand that to say you get a new
[1:22:39] spirit he said people take that as being
[1:22:41] the Holy
[1:22:43] Spirit he said it's not the Holy
[1:22:48] Spirit it can be the Holy Spirit working
[1:22:51] upon all of those senses right right
[1:22:53] that don't make you a
[1:22:56] Christian well I thought I understood
[1:22:58] till you preached
[1:23:01] it I done my job that's up to you to
[1:23:05] take the rest of
[1:23:07] it and decide within yourself whether
[1:23:09] you're born again or not that's right
[1:23:12] right and it's like I've told you I
[1:23:15] don't
[1:23:18] expect for the biggest portion of
[1:23:21] you
[1:23:24] I'm not preaching out there I'm
[1:23:25] preaching here I don't expect the
[1:23:27] biggest portion of you to even consider
[1:23:30] that you may not be born
[1:23:33] again because you've been taught all of
[1:23:35] your life that If you deny you're born
[1:23:43] again deny the father you deny the son
[1:23:47] well let's keep the Trinity
[1:23:51] then
[1:23:53] that's
[1:23:56] Bible
[1:23:58] right you a that nobody throw that in
[1:24:00] your face when you're trying to talk to
[1:24:02] them about one true and living God and
[1:24:03] they'll quote you the scripture the
[1:24:05] Bible said If you deny the father you
[1:24:08] denied a son and said he's going to deny
[1:24:13] you boy that's really great going let's
[1:24:16] straighten everything
[1:24:19] out what do you think about it

[1:26:33] righteousness that's
[1:26:36] scripture what you Prophet
[1:26:40] say he said that's
[1:26:43] right he said but what did God
[1:26:46] do to
[1:26:50] Abraham that he gave the sign of
[1:26:58] circumcision he said he walked
[1:27:04] different God done something for
