[3:02] I borrowed brother marks glasses once he
[3:09] threw them there this morning who can
[3:13] find a virtuous woman for her price is
[3:16] far above rubies she will do him good
[3:27] and not evil all the days of her life
[3:36] she is like the merchant ships she
[3:39] brings her food from afar she considered
[3:52] the field and buy it with the fruit of
[3:54] her hands she planned at the vineyard
[4:02] she perceive it that her merchandise is
[4:05] good her candle goeth not out by night
[4:14] she stretches forth out her hand to the
[4:17] poor yay she reaches forth her hand to
[4:20] the needy she met with her self
[4:30] coverings of tapestry and her clothing
[4:33] is silk and purple she maketh the fine
[4:42] linen selleth it and delivereth girdles
[4:44] unto the merchants
[4:51] she opened her mouth with wisdom and in
[4:54] her tongue is the law of kindness her
[5:04] children arise up and call her blessed
[5:06] her husband also and he praiseth her
[5:16] favor is deceitful and beauty is vain
[5:20] but a woman that hears the Lord
[5:23] she should be praised give her of the
[5:28] fruit of her hands
[5:29] and let her own works praise her in the
[5:32] gates you may be seated

[18:31] dire seating and because they're missing
[18:34] from up here so that's the part that we
[18:36] have to do to try to make everything do
[18:38] we're gonna try to to abide by as much
[18:41] of rules and regulations and things as
[18:44] they put on until it gets to a point of
[18:47] where it's crossing the wrong time we we
[18:50] try to do the best we can so we put up
[18:52] with it and everything like that so just
[18:54] we appreciate it glad to see the sisters
[18:56] here close there we've been missing you
[18:59] know we have we had services and all and
[19:05] we've done real good and you know and
[19:07] the Lord's blessed us and everything but
[19:09] we still miss our wives and miss the
[19:12] children and and all of the ones that in
[19:15] order to be here we're glad you here now

[19:33] your schedule to make everything right
[19:34] or what you're doing we're just trying
[19:37] to serve the Lord and to do what we can
[19:42] make sure now that you follow the
[19:47] Deacons and the things they're set to
[19:50] word that everything is right - were you

[20:23] and let's go down that way it won't be
[20:25] everybody crowded at once you know and
[20:26] remember what we're trying to do as much
[20:29] as possible to stay you know so much
[20:34] apart whatever we can do until things
[20:38] change on that so keep all of this in my
[20:41] know don't be trying to I've always been
[20:46] one in this is this is contrary to my

[20:56] been a lot of places and this is way
[20:58] back and shook hands with people and
[21:02] hugged her neck when found out later
[21:04] they didn't believe in that you know
[21:07] what it didn't take long I got him to
[21:10] believe it in it or at least they abided
[21:12] by it and done it you know because they
[21:15] would do it with me but you know just
[21:17] trying to make you contact as much as
[21:19] least as you can and everything with
[21:22] each other and talk and fellowship
[21:24] together but try to do everything you
[21:27] don't have to get out there and spin
[21:29] round and around to try to find out
[21:31] who's closest to you just just be you
[21:34] know let everything be done decently and
[21:36] in order to where we can do it all right
[21:38] if you like turning you scriptures
[21:40] turning mark the fourth chapter of Mark
[21:45] and then we're gonna go to Hebrews 1140

[21:55] down here so we thank you for all of the
[21:58] mothers we appreciate all of you that
[22:01] has been to the part we we're gonna try
[22:05] to speak on a last part of our message
[22:07] if we can today and it will be related
[22:10] to you'll still be related to the
[22:13] sisters of the church alright so if
[22:15] you'd like to follow along with and in
[22:18] mark for father we thank you for your
[22:21] grace in your love we thank you for the
[22:23] day in the hour that we have thank you
[22:26] for being you we just ask you now that
[22:29] you'd come among us Lord and should be
[22:31] with us thank you for the opportunity
[22:33] for the sisters and all the others to be
[22:36] I gathered together to where we can be
[22:38] in fellowship together in you together
[22:41] in a house where we can call it your
[22:44] place that you asked you we set it aside
[22:47] for you so you just take care of it you
[22:49] keep all of the sicknesses away from the
[22:52] people and everything Lord remember
[22:54] those that are the different ones Lord

[23:01] sister Gianni and sister Jean Lord be
[23:04] with them be with other Dale and sister
[23:07] Mary all of these Lord just remember
[23:09] each one and just take care of and just
[23:11] keep those old sicknesses away from your
[23:14] little bride around the world because
[23:16] that's your promise to us that you said
[23:18] you wouldn't let the enemy come in and
[23:20] take over
[23:21] so we believe you and we trust you and
[23:23] we depend upon you have your way forgive
[23:26] our sins and lead us by thy grace and
[23:29] love in Jesus name we're gonna go to
[23:34] mark this is where we used but we'll try
[23:37] to tie it together and bring the message
[23:39] to a close if we can mark for verse 26
[23:44] and he he said Joy's the kingdom of God
[23:47] as if a man should catch seed into the
[23:50] ground he should sleep and rise night
[23:53] and day and the seed should spring for
[23:56] spring and grow up he knoweth not how
[24:01] for the earth bring forth fruit of
[24:05] herself first the blade then the corn
[24:09] after that the full ear in full corn in
[24:12] the ear but when the fruit is brought
[24:16] forth immediately he put us in the
[24:19] sickle because the harvest is come now
[24:22] you see what if somebody's it's gonna be
[24:24] there when it comes to this fool corn in
[24:28] the ear then the sickle is placed in
[24:31] together
[24:32] all right now Hebrews 11 40 was the
[24:38] scripture we used for many many many
[24:40] many services but God having provided
[24:43] some better thing for us that they
[24:45] without us should not be made perfect
[24:48] you may be seated the Lord at his
[24:50] blessing to the reading of the word you
[24:53] know I I do see something there's this
[24:58] the families are sitting together and
[25:01] sometimes you know you you look around
[25:03] and you see in in the regular services
[25:05] we'd see one over here and one over here
[25:07] one back there and one over here
[25:08] everybody didn't have a regular seat
[25:10] like that they just sat down where they
[25:12] wanted to but this is kind of putting
[25:14] maybe a little little contact into the
[25:17] point but what I want to do now today I
[25:19] want if I can in you know how that is
[25:22] maybe ten more services but I want to
[25:25] try to bring this series to kind of
[25:28] conclusion that we've been talking about
[25:30] for many months and I earn Hebrews 1140
[25:34] that they without us could not be made
[25:36] perfect and the whole everything we know
[25:40] is groaning according to Romans 8
[25:42] waiting for the manifestation of the
[25:45] sons and daughters of the Living God and
[25:47] you know a time is here it has to be a
[25:50] place a position or something we're not
[25:53] saying the end of the world is here
[25:55] we've never taught nothing like that
[25:56] we've always just kind of held things to
[25:59] be what it is but there will be an end
[26:01] of all things and I do believe that
[26:03] we're in the end and that a lot of this
[26:06] that's going on now among the world
[26:08] around the world
[26:10] you know I say that it is the plagues
[26:14] and the things that was spoke up by the
[26:17] Bible and spoke about a prophet to come
[26:19] you know and how things would be here in
[26:22] our last days or but we are not a
[26:24] doomsday quit this or scared to death we
[26:28] ought to be the happiest people in the
[26:29] world now I mean that's as honest as I
[26:32] can make it we ought to be a Christian
[26:36] or to be the happiest time now of any
[26:39] time you've ever been in the message
[26:41] because we're here to end how long
[26:46] that's not a business but we're here at
[26:48] the end of all things has come upon us
[26:51] and and this happening and and all like
[26:53] that and just watch it around the world
[26:55] I wouldn't be talking you've never heard
[26:57] me say things like that but you've never
[26:59] seen a time when the
[27:01] entire world was affected by the
[27:03] situation the way it is now and you know
[27:07] so that has to be meaning that if satire
[27:09] is finishing we're at the end of all
[27:11] things we're not worried as I said we
[27:15] should be happy and say thank you Lord
[27:17] come and finish up what's to be done and
[27:20] get us out of here we look for this
[27:22] we've longed for this we started with
[27:25] our Christian journey and the baptism of
[27:27] the holy ghost in our heart to be happy
[27:29] and joyous that no matter how bad the
[27:32] situation gets life in troubles and
[27:35] everything it's still it's there for us
[27:38] to be happy because we're Christians
[27:41] we're born again believers we're in in
[27:43] and being in the place you know that God
[27:47] can come and live in us and get this
[27:50] finished up so that's that we should be
[27:53] thrilled about it instead of sad about
[27:55] it you know oh now humanly speaking we
[27:59] don't know what's going on I don't claim
[28:01] to know that's that's worth you know I
[28:04] don't claim to know this is though and
[28:06] so this is the one from there no no we
[28:08] just walk day by day and just me what it
[28:12] is now and then we'll it'll finish up
[28:14] and God will make it manifest we're
[28:17] supposed to be all right but we're going
[28:20] to try to speak a little message you to
[28:22] be related to mother's day because we
[28:25] appreciate all of your you the mothers
[28:28] of the church because you know it is a
[28:31] wonderful situation and I've made my
[28:33] emphases I hope over the years on enough
[28:37] to to get you to realize that we really
[28:40] appreciate true Christian sisters now
[28:45] that's something to have children do you
[28:48] know that can look to their parents and
[28:50] see in their parents you know the love
[28:55] of God and trying to raise them into
[28:58] being sons and daughters of God to to be
[29:02] you know good people that's what our
[29:04] point is is always have being a lot of
[29:08] emphasis is made in the Bible especially
[29:11] after we came into the message we didn't
[29:14] you know we study the things we talk
[29:16] about the things while we were there in
[29:19] their denominations but ever since I've
[29:22] been in the message the emphasis is more
[29:24] to the sisters alright because it is the
[29:29] basis that you are the mothers of each
[29:32] one
[29:33] you know and it's your part you you're
[29:36] doing your part and all like that like I
[29:38] always tell you you know you go down to
[29:40] Walmart and you walk around old man he
[29:42] walks around it didn't matter you know
[29:44] he did it how he looks I mean you know
[29:47] and all like that and George did get
[29:49] onto me one time because I had my pants
[29:51] my painting pants on and I was in
[29:54] Walmart walking around but still you
[29:57] know not it's not a lot said about that
[30:00] but when a sister's walk down through
[30:02] Walmart or anywhere they're recognized
[30:06] the higher the dress the the mannerisms
[30:10] the things you know are dressed and
[30:12] honored and welcomed among people
[30:16] because it is a you know you are the the
[30:20] mothers of all and it was connected and
[30:22] it see I've always even taught you this
[30:25] that see that you say well that Adam was
[30:28] the first creation that's right but
[30:30] without Eve there would have been
[30:31] nothing to taking place without a woman
[30:36] of a woman to put into the position you
[30:39] wouldn't had no word about naming
[30:41] animals or what you're doing or what
[30:43] everything was to be done you wouldn't
[30:45] have to worry about what this is or that
[30:47] is but then when you put the woman in
[30:49] there you know we we get into a lot in
[30:52] the message ranks that a lot is
[30:55] condemning the women for their ways and
[30:58] maybe that's true I mean if you it needs
[31:00] to be condemned it needs to be spoke out
[31:02] against alright that's true you know if
[31:06] women are not dressing right and acting
[31:09] right you know looking right and trying
[31:13] to be what they're supposed to be there
[31:14] ought to be rebuked you know it ought to
[31:17] be but what about the men - they just
[31:20] don't leave us men out because see we've
[31:22] got our part to go - all right but
[31:25] that's the point I want you to think
[31:26] about today because
[31:27] we we have spent quite a while talking
[31:32] you know speaking about the bases of day
[31:37] without us cannot be made perfect all
[31:40] right we went through that covered in
[31:42] many many different ways and avenues and
[31:45] coming to find out that you know the
[31:48] whole world is now waiting on you and I
[31:52] what about that the whole world
[31:55] everything you do you think the natural
[31:58] world out there today if they knew who
[32:01] it was that was you know it's horrible
[32:03] right it's horrible I mean deaths on
[32:06] everything all the way around the world
[32:07] but you just think what it would be if
[32:09] the little bride wouldn't here right you
[32:15] realize that there right now saying if
[32:17] they knew what they was doing they would
[32:20] be glorying and they'd be bowing down to
[32:22] you and and saying you know stay here
[32:26] with us because without you being here
[32:28] we don't have no hopes all right because
[32:33] there's no oh no what would you call it
[32:37] no promise to the world of anything it's
[32:41] only promise to the bride all right and
[32:44] see that little bride then she's she
[32:46] should be honored she should be as I
[32:48] tried to emphasize during one of the
[32:50] messages you know when you go through a
[32:52] wedding then the hold for session or
[32:54] what you call it the whole thing is
[32:56] related around the bride and her coming
[33:00] in and her dress in her clothes you know
[33:03] everything you know it's all pointing
[33:06] toward her well that's that's a great
[33:09] honor that's a great time that we we
[33:11] should honor it like that alright but
[33:14] you see that goes from the natural now
[33:16] into the spiritual okay from the natural
[33:21] to the spiritual in the spiritual I
[33:23] believe God's waiting on this bride
[33:25] that's what you're probably says he's
[33:27] waiting on you and I well why can't we
[33:31] believe that that and not be down and
[33:33] out about the times and situations but
[33:36] to realize that he is there with us
[33:39] no matter what he's promised to be there
[33:42] all right
[33:43] and I've never seen him fail have you I
[33:46] mean we've seen him everything in the
[33:49] world to come forth and and manifest
[33:51] itself in our day well there's no need
[33:53] of getting down and out about it now on
[33:55] you know and all but to be happy in God
[33:59] to realize that this has happened to
[34:02] which to be all right just get that
[34:07] little point of your mind that's getting
[34:08] that's the thought I have to use the
[34:11] sisters we honor you we cherish you and
[34:14] all and we don't have to put it we don't
[34:18] do everything here you know we we try to
[34:20] do it on the basis of sisters we count
[34:22] sisters and sisters you don't have to be
[34:25] a mama to be a sister you know that's
[34:28] that's that's not the point you don't
[34:30] have to be that way you can can you know
[34:32] you're a sister in Christ all right and
[34:36] we honor you young old or whatever we
[34:39] honor the sisters because you are
[34:42] cherished among us so thank on that
[34:44] alright now what I want you to think on
[34:48] is a situation that brother branham I
[34:51] ask you to read our to study listening
[34:54] the masterpiece and there's two of them
[34:59] only seeds not our with shucks I ask you
[35:03] to go through them and read them and
[35:05] study them and then let's talk a little
[35:07] bit about it because after all of the
[35:11] foundational part I'll make it as an F
[35:16] to you if it is true that the whole
[35:22] world is waiting on the Bride of Christ
[35:25] alright if it's true that all the
[35:28] world's waiting on the sons and
[35:30] daughters of the Living God
[35:31] alright then in them waiting on that to
[35:35] manifest who we are see then that little
[35:41] bride is the most valued part there is
[35:46] but to find her day all right
[35:52] we went through talking about the broad
[35:54] across we don't as I said we don't just
[35:56] pound on the women and glory on the men
[36:00] we we talk about the body of Christ the
[36:04] Bride of Christ which is the body of the
[36:06] Lord Jesus Christ which is male and
[36:09] female we're all feminine in the body of
[36:11] Christ right you understand that we're
[36:13] all male or whatever we are we're
[36:15] feminine in the body of Christ our part
[36:18] is to be a wife not to be a husband to
[36:21] it to be a wife all right and to serve
[36:24] Him has to be that part and don't you
[36:26] worry about he'll serve you he'll take
[36:28] care of you
[36:29] but my point now is today is thinking
[36:32] about you realize without the the bride
[36:39] there would be no hopes
[36:43] without the finishing up of God's Word
[36:48] is my whole point okay now trying to get
[36:53] a thought because I didn't want to study
[36:55] this I put down just a few notes and
[36:58] just run off from a few things to hand
[37:01] out for you to think about something but
[37:04] I wanted to just speak on it has to be
[37:07] as from a mother's day situation and
[37:10] honor and you know respecting the
[37:13] sisters to bring it down to the
[37:17] finishing up of the where it says they
[37:21] without us cannot be made perfect all
[37:25] right now meaning the bride as long as
[37:29] she's here as we still God's gonna be
[37:32] here he's gonna take care of us so we
[37:34] don't have to worry about that we're not
[37:36] concerned but what we're concerned with
[37:38] is honoring him are are obeying him are
[37:43] being what he wants us to be all right
[37:45] and then take the message and study it
[37:48] from that to see what it's talking about
[37:50] and what I want to be talking now is
[37:56] you've heard the word used and if you
[37:58] listen to the couple of messages asking
[38:00] you heard Brett around and speak a lot
[38:02] about carriers
[38:05] you know he even says the denomination's
[38:07] were carriers then you know they were
[38:12] when they don't know them denomination
[38:14] see so you're blinking out totally
[38:18] what's being thought the thought that
[38:20] I'm trying to progress to bring to you
[38:23] me the Baptist was the move of God for
[38:28] the day the Methodist was the move of
[38:31] God I'm saying move of God all right you
[38:35] understand me they were the people of
[38:36] God they were a part of the body of
[38:39] Christ to be made manifest in the day
[38:43] they were living all right but yes
[38:47] knowing that day was more to come okay
[38:51] all right see then being a carrier is
[38:54] not a bad thing Mary carried the word
[39:01] right she carried the words he she
[39:05] brought forth the word all right the
[39:09] denominations for their day were
[39:10] carriers but we want to put it know
[39:14] though they're out there other than
[39:15] that's where you missing it you can't
[39:19] study the message and do like I asked
[39:21] you to read it you did you you read it
[39:23] over and over where brother Branham was
[39:25] talking about Luthor Wesley Pentecost
[39:31] and he said how that they started out
[39:35] the Luther started out in the right but
[39:38] then he denominated now not Luther the
[39:44] Lutheran not him he stayed with the word
[39:48] as much as he could until the day was
[39:50] dying I guess then it comes in to Wesley
[39:54] we talked about then come in to Azusa
[39:58] Street on Pentecost there were each
[40:01] displacing they were not the full word
[40:05] you say you haven't no wait a minute
[40:07] your area now listen to what I'm saying
[40:11] it says there in the scriptures that you
[40:15] have it this way you have this way but
[40:17] it says then the
[40:18] full corn in the ear in other words a
[40:26] full ear of corn
[40:27] a full ear of corn is not a green ear of
[40:31] corn either a full ear of corn is corn
[40:34] that's ready to be replanted if
[40:36] necessary it has a two-fold compart I
[40:40] mean part of it can be replanted right
[40:43] then if it's full if it's fully matured
[40:46] dried all right but it can also be
[40:50] ground up and made into bread to eat so
[40:54] it has a great situation me and like
[40:57] I've tried to tell you he's in Luther he
[41:00] couldn't produce all of it he done the
[41:04] best he could do he brought it forth and
[41:07] for the day it was the Word of God and
[41:09] the move of God for that our baddest
[41:11] mood in Methodists Presbyterians all
[41:16] kind of groups came in and they started
[41:19] out as being the word for that day but
[41:28] yet things went wrong before brother run
[41:33] said before they could go on and and and
[41:35] produce and God could come to his bride
[41:37] he said Satan entered there in all right
[41:41] that's what's happened in the last days
[41:44] that's why we're here so many years
[41:46] after the Prophet going off the same
[41:48] well because Satan has moved in all
[41:53] right and he's pounding away at this
[41:56] little bride now doing it in the natural
[41:59] but it's coming into spiritual don't
[42:01] worry about it it'll be here but think
[42:04] about it now but around cause Luther a
[42:08] carrier because he a carrier it means
[42:13] really what you're saying to line up
[42:16] with a spiritual application that Luther
[42:21] was not the full word he had the word
[42:24] for his day it was the seat of God for
[42:27] the day it was the part of the the
[42:30] part of the bride across for that day
[42:32] but he didn't go on and finish it Wesley
[42:37] was part of the word but he didn't go on
[42:40] and finish it the greatest of zeus the
[42:43] street was part of the word but it
[42:46] didn't go ahead and finish it all right
[42:48] so now when you're talking about
[42:50] something that's I'm hoping this will
[42:55] come to the right point but when you're
[42:57] talking about a carrier that's something
[43:00] that's taking place of are standing in
[43:03] awe of you know and being and do it
[43:05] Luther he didn't finish it Wesley didn't
[43:09] finish it
[43:09] Zeus the street didn't finish it but
[43:11] there's a bride in the last days it's
[43:17] not to be part of the work that's one
[43:21] malachi for luke 1730 revelation 10
[43:23] seven had to come into being
[43:24] that's why the prophet had to come to
[43:26] bring the message his message was to
[43:30] bring the bride to the full maturity not
[43:35] if there was anything wrong i would i'm
[43:36] right here standing and i would have
[43:39] been happy to been brought forth in the
[43:41] days of martin luther if I'd have been
[43:45] in the word of that day wouldn't you I
[43:49] would have been glad to have done I've
[43:51] been glad to bring for God to put me in
[43:53] any age as long as I'm part of the pride
[43:56] of that age all right you get one gone
[43:59] by it doesn't matter what it a DD as
[44:01] long as I'm part of the bride of that
[44:03] age I'm happy to be what I am but then
[44:07] I'm happy that he chose me to be what I
[44:10] am you realize he chose you to be to
[44:16] finish this thing up he chose you to be
[44:20] the word not saying that Luther wasn't
[44:24] the word when it was just part word he
[44:30] proved it by the fact that that went on
[44:32] denominated and died off all right see
[44:35] it proved what it was but next thing
[44:38] would come Wesley next would come and
[44:40] proving what they were but they would
[44:43] die and go
[44:43] all because there was not the full word
[44:46] but somebody's not gonna die you
[44:50] remember now that we tried to bring that
[44:52] out in the message over and over they
[44:53] without us you realize the whole
[44:56] brighter Jesus Christ is hinged upon
[44:59] whether or not somebody can receive the
[45:03] word and believe it and become it for
[45:06] where we're at right now Luther's word
[45:09] was great Wesley's was great
[45:11] Pentecost was great I'd have been happy
[45:13] to been in any of those ages you say
[45:17] well I wouldn't want to been back on
[45:18] them Pentecostals no I would have I'd
[45:22] have been happy if God chose me for that
[45:24] age but he didn't choose me for that he
[45:26] chose me for the endtime he chose you to
[45:31] be here he chose a prophet to bring a
[45:34] message but he chose a bride you
[45:36] remember how we brought it out in the
[45:38] life service now even right was the
[45:40] sheath waive all right now what what was
[45:45] the purpose of the sheath wave whatever
[45:51] was standing there waving to remember
[45:53] the high priest when we started off in
[45:56] the first turn Canaan
[45:57] then it got into individuals life to
[46:00] them but there was that sheaf being
[46:02] waved to show that there was a whole
[46:05] field full of wheat you remember that
[46:09] see the purpose of it and so alright
[46:12] they without us cannot be made perfect
[46:14] if somebody is reaching the position
[46:17] then it shows that the rest of the field
[46:20] is there when the Prophet brought his
[46:22] message I don't care if it's 50 years
[46:24] later you know from the time he went off
[46:27] the same the message is still alive
[46:29] that's the greatest of all the message
[46:35] is still alive to the people of the end
[46:37] time that believe it and they're
[46:40] thanking God for those that are really
[46:42] into the word because why because we're
[46:45] not to be just part of the word the last
[46:48] age is not to be just part remember out
[46:51] I was thinking on the I will restore the
[46:54] years of the cankerworm locust
[46:56] caterpillar no he promised to restore it
[46:59] all right and to go into that you go
[47:02] into what Wade was talking about see
[47:04] that you've got three stages and then
[47:06] you got to go into the fourth to finish
[47:08] in our day because number four is sure
[47:11] you can call number four an antichrist
[47:13] number but it's also a restoration it's
[47:18] a number of restoration you got four
[47:20] combat beasts I'd hate to take out the
[47:23] fourth one when you when you hate to
[47:28] take out if you say well well that we
[47:31] don't want that to be for a number so
[47:33] we're gonna take one out make sure you
[47:35] don't take the last one out for heaven's
[47:38] sake you'd be in a lot of trouble right
[47:40] alright but are you following my point
[47:42] my point is one thing a carrier can be a
[47:47] part of anything all right
[47:52] it carries that own it takes it forth
[47:56] just like in the in the garden you got
[47:59] in the garden elder ways got doing
[48:01] there's a house in the corn to about
[48:03] that heisting all right now it don't
[48:06] look like corn it does to our mentality
[48:10] of our words and thoughts
[48:12] it looks like corn it don't look like
[48:14] you know okra beans or whatever would
[48:17] get the point but it's not it's not full
[48:21] it won't be full until it's the full
[48:25] corn in the ear and as I said a moment
[48:28] ago it won't be full until you've got an
[48:31] ear of corn that is capable of the
[48:35] two-part thing one either to be
[48:38] replanted and come forth or to be ground
[48:43] up to make bread you couldn't do that in
[48:48] any age now are you listening you'll see
[48:53] that what it means but the profit would
[48:55] be over and over keep on talking about a
[48:56] parked Luther name was a part of this
[49:00] but there has to be an age when it's a
[49:02] full of it it's all coming to full
[49:05] maturity alright and in doing that it
[49:09] in the day when the bride realizes who
[49:12] she is and what she's here for the and
[49:18] to realize that if there is to be an end
[49:21] time it must be here if not who worth it
[49:24] coming from all right so you don't go
[49:30] and touch the corn right
[49:32] wait look how do you say well what wait
[49:34] you what do you got there I got some
[49:35] corn well that don't look like corn it
[49:40] does in the stage where it's at in part
[49:43] cause these two shoots front uh but it
[49:46] don't look like an ear of corn and if
[49:50] you don't get nothing out of the message
[49:51] that just remember that one time - been
[49:55] talking about the word of God in its
[49:57] fullness you got to be able to plant
[50:02] what you've got or eat what you got you
[50:08] know you've got to be you got to have it
[50:10] - the basis that you can see the day in
[50:12] the hour that you're living and that day
[50:14] an hour is it's putting it to the basis
[50:16] of the word Luther had the word of his
[50:19] age right but he didn't have the full
[50:23] maturity of your he was just the two
[50:25] shoots - running up or something you
[50:27] know uh-huh you say that's corn sure
[50:30] that's corn but don't watch out and
[50:33] gather it you got to wait until
[50:37] everything comes to full maturity once
[50:39] it comes to full maturity then you've
[50:42] got a full ear of corn ready to be
[50:46] either ground to make food are to be
[50:48] eaten you know as to what you need to do
[50:51] of it I want that part in your mind and
[50:55] you'll see why brother branham would
[50:57] call them carriers I remember when I
[51:02] first heard him making no statements I
[51:04] thought and they don't sound right to
[51:10] say that Luther was a carrier Wesley was
[51:14] a carrier and he even says Mary who
[51:18] represent Azusa Street that Mary was a
[51:21] carrier
[51:23] he said she was not the seed and listen
[51:26] to it said the seed was in her she's not
[51:34] the mother of God he said the seed was
[51:38] in Mary right she gave birth to the seat
[51:41] but that didn't make her the full-grown
[51:43] seed either come on you got to get Jesus
[51:49] Christ Burt which means the full word
[51:53] what is the full word you know what the
[51:56] last of masterpiece and look at him as
[51:59] he's talking about the seals and the
[52:01] opening of the seals and the things
[52:03] that's coming forth and how that is
[52:05] coming into full maturity in this day
[52:09] because this is not a carrier the day is
[52:15] not a carrier come on now listen to what
[52:19] your prophet said so I've got them here
[52:21] if you want me to really there's nothing
[52:22] pipes Mary there's no other move come on
[52:31] you say yeah but what you're getting the
[52:34] point but listen there is no women no
[52:37] mother no point of Pais Mary she's the
[52:41] life because she gives birth to Jesus
[52:43] Christ
[52:45] Azusa Street was the last manifestation
[52:52] to give birth to Jesus Christ and they
[52:55] did but that didn't make them Jesus
[53:00] Christ didn't make them God but
[53:03] somebody's got to have that other there
[53:05] is a life stage to be made manifest
[53:11] somebody has got to be there there had
[53:14] to be a people to manifest Luther's
[53:16] message right they had to be a group of
[53:21] people to manifest Wesley's message
[53:23] right they had to be a people to
[53:26] manifest Zeus the street Pentecost right
[53:31] all right come on there's got to be
[53:34] somebody to my
[53:36] manifests the full Word of God you've
[53:39] had your prophet he's coming down his
[53:42] part he's manifest in his whole part it
[53:49] was done is his day is finished
[53:52] uh-huh see if there's not another woman
[53:57] to be able to put it there because Mary
[54:02] was the lies the Prophet said there's no
[54:07] manifestation pipes Mary as far as
[54:10] people that's why you got
[54:12] oh is it Hagar Sarah and Mary that's as
[54:17] far as you go because see you got to go
[54:23] justification sanctification baptism of
[54:26] the Holy Ghost
[54:27] then the word right and see then that's
[54:34] what it is not carriers in this day
[54:37] we're not a carrier I know that's gonna
[54:42] go hard on a lot of people's thinking
[54:44] because you're gonna you're thinking I'm
[54:45] trying to make something greater than
[54:47] what Lutheran Westland I am so get on to
[54:51] it listen the Word of God is the great
[54:54] thing the Word of God in this day we are
[55:01] the people to make manifest the last
[55:04] move that there is to the Gentile
[55:07] dispensation are you following me
[55:10] somebody's got to make it none of this
[55:13] somebody's got to be that life spark but
[55:18] the live part can't be a carrier because
[55:23] the carrier would always signify part
[55:25] and not a fullness see brother Branham
[55:33] said and one of them said when the bride
[55:35] begins to say I and my father one of
[55:37] these other things that's why they gonna
[55:44] come after you they wasn't trying to
[55:48] come after
[55:49] the people back in the Old Testament but
[55:51] when the Lord Jesus stepped out to her
[55:53] and said I and my father are one that
[55:56] was ready to kill him because they knew
[56:00] what he meant
[56:02] alright now if you'll listen swallow if
[56:05] you think it'll ever be a persecution
[56:08] unto the people of this bride in any
[56:10] form to try to do then realize what
[56:13] you're doing
[56:14] something's got to bring that to PI's do
[56:22] you go to bring it down on your own self
[56:23] if you don't know it by being what you
[56:26] are
[56:27] is going to bring the church system
[56:31] after us it's not what is it
[56:37] somebody tell me I'm frightened
[56:39] appreciate 50 years what one thing to
[56:43] know that the bride of Jesus Christ what
[56:46] you and I the preaching the living the
[56:51] doing that we bring in this day is going
[56:54] to bring the world after us right
[57:02] they're going to bring it after us
[57:06] they're gonna they're gonna try their
[57:08] best to close us out well because we're
[57:12] going to preach contrary to them now if
[57:14] you don't understand what I'm saying
[57:16] listen you'd never hear a denominational
[57:20] person claiming two denominations were
[57:22] carriers do you think the Pentecostals
[57:27] would say they were just carriers
[57:30] brother Brown said that's what it was he
[57:36] said the Baptist was carriers the
[57:37] messages you know read the book carriers
[57:43] of the word but somebody's got to be the
[57:45] word the full word
[57:49] because that's what the scripture said
[57:51] that we read the full ear the full corn
[57:56] in the ear now Luther named manifested
[58:04] today they were living there there was
[58:06] Arthur that was the time of the hour
[58:08] they were living and they made it
[58:10] manifest and God honored out sees in it
[58:14] denominated and died because they didn't
[58:16] go on with this life stay there's no
[58:20] place to denominated run run said you
[58:22] came to nominate this medicine he said
[58:27] now they'll organ and I organized it
[58:29] into lady osya
[58:30] which you came to nominate this message
[58:33] well cuz it's back to the word how can
[58:37] you denominator word you can de nominate
[58:43] anything that stays in the line of
[58:45] carriers because that's the only part
[58:49] word but when it comes to the point that
[58:56] you come to the peer work there's no
[58:58] carriers involved it's finished
[59:01] the bride of Jesus Christ is standing
[59:05] here in the last days to finish up to
[59:16] finish up what did brother Branham say
[59:20] it this way he said listen he spoke
[59:22] original see he said Jesus never
[59:26] finished his work while he was here you
[59:31] remember that he said there was things
[59:34] that he didn't finish he said yeah he
[59:39] did no he didn't he didn't finish the
[59:42] message brother Branham come to finish
[59:49] the message more than the Lord you're
[59:51] gonna swallow harder take this one down
[59:53] we're taking but a random come to the
[59:57] point of a finishing of the message more
[1:00:00] than even the point of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:03] why because it wasn't I'm the Lord Jesus
[1:00:05] preached the seals right come on when he
[1:00:08] couldn't make it manifest why cause it
[1:00:11] wouldn't I'm right where was it to be
[1:00:15] telling ya if he had a brought that
[1:00:22] forth and finished it up you wouldn't
[1:00:24] have Malachi 4 in Luke 17 13 I like that
[1:00:27] you wouldn't have those things to be
[1:00:29] involved come on but he brought the word
[1:00:37] that was to be brought left it in that
[1:00:40] form until the Prophet could come in the
[1:00:42] last days and take us on into the full
[1:00:47] word the full maturity right of the coin
[1:00:53] then how many of you remember what we
[1:00:58] talked about the other day about it see
[1:00:59] when the children of Israel entered
[1:01:01] Canaan land they ate of the old corn of
[1:01:04] the land I preached that about 40 years
[1:01:08] ago the old corn of the land the manna
[1:01:15] ceased Ricci Bible the manna ceased the
[1:01:23] manner that carried them through the
[1:01:25] wilderness all the time that they live
[1:01:28] by when they entered the land of Canaan
[1:01:33] the Bible says the banner ceased why
[1:01:40] because the old corn is a greater deeper
[1:01:43] depth of the word it's not as wrong it's
[1:01:48] a deeper depth of God's Word it was full
[1:01:51] maturity you got to get into the
[1:01:52] promised land Cana was the promised land
[1:01:55] which was a type of the baptism of the
[1:01:58] Holy Ghost with what followers the
[1:02:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost then into the
[1:02:02] word right so that's why you see say the
[1:02:10] four is see I know I've had discussions
[1:02:13] with people Oh forth Antichrist
[1:02:16] quote brother branham before is also
[1:02:19] restoration cankerworm palm warm local
[1:02:21] caterpillar justification st. kidding
[1:02:25] baptism holy ghost and the full word
[1:02:27] adoptions statute of perfect man the
[1:02:30] things you want to use making it too
[1:02:34] that way but listen the old corn the old
[1:02:43] corn is a fool gathered ear
[1:02:48] come on like I said do you mean you know
[1:02:52] you don't think maybe a lot of times
[1:02:54] about it but maybe an old farmer think
[1:02:56] more about it you know you need some
[1:02:59] corn bread you look out in the field and
[1:03:05] you see a whole field full of corn they
[1:03:07] go here's this big you know yelling
[1:03:09] sweet and I'm gonna try and get me some
[1:03:12] of that and cook me some corn bread
[1:03:18] you're gonna mess up you you can go cook
[1:03:21] what you got out there and you can eat
[1:03:23] what you got out there and live by what
[1:03:25] you got out there but when they come to
[1:03:28] the old corner of the land that was the
[1:03:31] land was ready to be gathered
[1:03:34] you don't gather in mature corn come on
[1:03:42] you said I'm going out here and get me
[1:03:44] some corn us good but you're gonna need
[1:03:46] it right to in or it's gonna rotten you
[1:03:49] take the good corn you got to wait til
[1:03:51] this like November here the most people
[1:03:54] wouldn't even think about that you don't
[1:03:56] you don't think but November somewhere
[1:03:58] wrong in there it's in our area your
[1:04:00] corn starts getting to enough that you
[1:04:02] could go out there and pull it off the
[1:04:03] stock but remember because you pull it
[1:04:08] off stock you better not taking a burn
[1:04:10] to the grinder even though it's dry
[1:04:17] where they ain't dry enough you know
[1:04:19] what you're doing we put it in the barn
[1:04:23] spread it out because you don't let it
[1:04:25] be green if it's green it's gone rotten
[1:04:29] mess up so you spread it out in your
[1:04:32] barn and left it for another month or
[1:04:34] two then you could go gather it pick
[1:04:36] that up and take it down to the meal and
[1:04:39] having ground up it's got to be fully
[1:04:41] gratefully ground able that's what I'm
[1:04:44] trying to say you've got to get it to
[1:04:46] the basis the work can be eat our planet
[1:04:51] you can take that corn that you've got
[1:04:53] in about December somewhere in a month
[1:04:55] of that and and you can take the corn
[1:04:58] and go down and get it out of your bill
[1:04:59] and go plant it one because it's a dry
[1:05:03] tira corn its fullest in the corn it's
[1:05:05] it's done it's corn but it can also be
[1:05:08] made into bread right Zuko that's why
[1:05:14] your old corner of the land it was
[1:05:16] already done it was ready to be
[1:05:18] harvested and getting ready to be you
[1:05:23] know cooked no might still have to lay
[1:05:27] it up for a while cause it's got to be
[1:05:29] that away but when you get that part
[1:05:31] then you can eat it that's the word this
[1:05:37] message is is it should be drying it you
[1:05:40] remember what he's talking about how
[1:05:42] that be linked up in the top of the
[1:05:44] trees is your prettiest fruit thing
[1:05:49] because that's where that's the day in
[1:05:51] the hour that we're living listen
[1:05:55] sisters listen to what I'm saying I'm
[1:05:56] bragging talking about you as a a woman
[1:05:59] and representation of a bride of Jesus
[1:06:01] Christ God has been waiting on you and I
[1:06:12] he's done his job he's brought all he
[1:06:16] promised right tell me something else
[1:06:22] he's promised tell me something else in
[1:06:26] the Bible that's promised ain't no woman
[1:06:33] Pais Mary the Mary was the one that said
[1:06:37] it and when you use it in you correct
[1:06:39] huh she said
[1:06:42] be it unto me according to thy word
[1:06:45] that's what brought forth the birth of
[1:06:48] Jesus Christ when she said it anyway
[1:06:52] there's no woman out - then why because
[1:06:55] the next stage is the seed she had to
[1:06:59] give birth to the rock you burped she
[1:07:03] gave birth to the work she carried it
[1:07:05] nine months and birth the word rot but
[1:07:11] she wasn't the word that away he said no
[1:07:16] that don't sound all right you read what
[1:07:17] the prophets hidden let's say you say it
[1:07:19] so that's what he keeps saying he says
[1:07:22] Mary I know it's four or five times he
[1:07:27] said Mary is not the seed he said she
[1:07:34] was a carrier what's he talking about
[1:07:41] he's talking about it there's nothing
[1:07:43] pipes Mary well quickly she gave birth
[1:07:47] to the word that settled but you can see
[1:07:51] she was a carrier because if I'm looking
[1:07:53] at a prophet what happened to Mary when
[1:07:59] she denied the Lord Jesus as the virgin
[1:08:03] birth you'll see she was a carrier she
[1:08:06] didn't nominate heed it that's what's
[1:08:09] your profit see because see that's what
[1:08:11] happened when they worked went over and
[1:08:13] come back you know and started in and
[1:08:15] she said where was Jesus and they found
[1:08:18] him and said I must be about my father's
[1:08:19] business but I run said the biggest
[1:08:22] mistake she ever made was saying that
[1:08:24] because she was denying him to be the
[1:08:26] virgin birth he was denying the virgin
[1:08:34] birth of the word that she had given
[1:08:35] birth herself - and Jesus corrected her
[1:08:39] the word that's why brother Branham had
[1:08:43] to come in the end time for that word to
[1:08:45] be able to come back and rebuke
[1:08:48] everything he rebuked ever denomination
[1:08:53] and toria's all them and coming down
[1:08:54] especially
[1:08:55] Azusa Street rebuking them for denying
[1:09:02] the word all we got to do is just eat
[1:09:06] the word God has given it to us what
[1:09:10] else what we won't what else do you need
[1:09:15] then to just eat the word as he brings
[1:09:17] it to us
[1:09:22] you see that's one of them you know I'm
[1:09:24] like it as a mother's day because he's
[1:09:30] waiting on the bride to come to form
[1:09:33] Authority come on he's standing in
[1:09:38] revelations one but when he gets over 12
[1:09:40] and 13 What did he say one standing in
[1:09:43] the midst of the seven golden
[1:09:44] candlesticks one like unto the Son of
[1:09:46] Man Girt about the paps with a golden
[1:09:48] girdle
[1:09:48] but one said that was the bride so
[1:09:56] everything has been waiting on the bride
[1:09:59] and you are that bride when are we gonna
[1:10:03] realize that I'm say thank the Lord
[1:10:06] married to him who is the word we don't
[1:10:15] have to look for another message to come
[1:10:17] no no there's no such thing as another
[1:10:19] message to come to try to perfect the
[1:10:22] people or what it's this message made
[1:10:25] alive is a perfection this message is
[1:10:34] the word
[1:10:38] it's the fully matured word whereas
[1:10:42] Luther you would call him part word
[1:10:43] Wesley you'd call him part word even if
[1:10:46] Zeus the street you'd call it part word
[1:10:48] with bread around a wooden part word
[1:10:51] come on I said that to reading them in
[1:10:54] it he wouldn't fart word no way he
[1:10:58] brought the forward not making him the
[1:11:01] Lord Jesus Christ cuz he was not he said
[1:11:03] don't you do that but he brought the
[1:11:06] pure unadulterated word
[1:11:11] what are we waiting on maybe that's
[1:11:19] what's taking place now maybe this is
[1:11:22] the final getting ready to go away are
[1:11:30] we ready
[1:11:34] because remember now there's no move
[1:11:38] pace Mary you go back to the word
[1:11:47] remember what we've been teaching now
[1:11:49] for months the bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:11:53] the son of man the Word made flesh the
[1:12:00] bride of Jesus Christ is the fullness of
[1:12:02] the Godhead bodily
[1:12:04] we won't over and over and over it to
[1:12:07] make sure you wouldn't misunderstand but
[1:12:09] have you really listened to that you
[1:12:16] realize what I've been teaching is all
[1:12:18] of these here the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:12:21] is God made manifest in another form
[1:12:25] there has to be there has to be some
[1:12:29] body make the word live if not there's
[1:12:35] nothing to wait on
[1:12:44] the window bride realized that who she
[1:12:46] is it starts tightening up on that word
[1:12:50] Satan's don't come after so brother tell
[1:12:57] the best thing to do is this just shut
[1:12:59] up now
[1:13:01] it's like firing my bones how can I shut
[1:13:04] up
[1:13:05] how can I stop talking about something
[1:13:08] that Ford almost 50 years ago that the
[1:13:11] Lord spoke to me and showed me that the
[1:13:14] bride of Jesus Christ would be the son
[1:13:16] of man the Word made flesh not a carrier
[1:13:24] son of man is not a carrier son of man
[1:13:28] is the word the fullness of the Godhead
[1:13:35] bodily
[1:13:36] in bride form is what's gonna bring
[1:13:39] Satan after you and I okay and we
[1:13:44] worried about whether or not they can do
[1:13:46] this or not they can do that all right
[1:13:53] but think about it do you understand
[1:13:56] what I've been saying then they without
[1:13:59] us could not be made perfect who us the
[1:14:05] bride the little bride God is looking at
[1:14:11] that little bride and he's saying just
[1:14:15] come on you remember how the prophet saw
[1:14:17] her when she was in the visions and sigh
[1:14:19] it's in one of the scene out of the show
[1:14:24] when he saw the vision of the woman you
[1:14:26] know and never he said in the last ones
[1:14:29] they was kind of getting out of line he
[1:14:31] would hollering at him to get that word
[1:14:38] lined up seeing him struggling to try to
[1:14:40] line up like on these times carriers are
[1:14:50] wonderful but they have their day
[1:14:58] but the bride she doesn't stop as a
[1:15:01] carrier she becomes the word made
[1:15:06] manifest the word made manifest is the
[1:15:12] son of man I didn't realize it we you're
[1:15:18] not listening you're trying to make son
[1:15:20] of man something else he's trying to
[1:15:21] make it some other point listen to what
[1:15:23] I'm talking about
[1:15:27] the son of man is the word why can't we
[1:15:35] say we're the word we know we're gonna
[1:15:40] start saying we're the word then you're
[1:15:48] going to see it
[1:15:49] because when the bride begins to say I
[1:15:51] my father won and these other things the
[1:15:54] shuck he said is gonna pull away well
[1:16:06] don't you think that it's kind of pulled
[1:16:08] away ain't talking about just from a
[1:16:10] Lula and a little I'm talking about
[1:16:13] worldwide from the bride because that's
[1:16:17] where it's gonna be
[1:16:18] ain't just Lula uh-huh but I'm glad to
[1:16:23] be a part of it
[1:16:24] I count myself to be a part of it I
[1:16:27] count myself to be the point that it's
[1:16:29] that I've held on for almost 50 years
[1:16:31] screaming at the church and hollers
[1:16:33] trying to get us to realize who we are
[1:16:39] but it is he that hasn't made us and not
[1:16:42] we ourselves we are as people the Sheep
[1:16:44] of his pasture whatever we are he made
[1:16:48] us that he chose us that's what I said
[1:16:49] I'm glad to be here I'd have been glad
[1:16:52] to have been in Luther's day I wouldn't
[1:16:53] have been dissatisfied with it as long
[1:16:55] as I knew I was part of the word of that
[1:16:57] day and I have no doubt whether or not I
[1:17:02] was standing by what Luther was teaching
[1:17:11] what are you talking about what are you
[1:17:13] thinking about what are you looking for
[1:17:21] well I don't know what they're gonna do
[1:17:23] I don't know we just haven't really
[1:17:25] weren't such a bad problems and all like
[1:17:27] that yeah the natural seed was only a
[1:17:33] carrier of the spiritual seed the
[1:17:41] natural seed would only a carrier or a
[1:17:43] spiritual seed topping it showing it
[1:17:46] coming down through Mary was a carrier
[1:17:55] of the word reading what he said this is
[1:18:02] from she's not our with the show taking
[1:18:08] the great thing of MU Mary she was only
[1:18:11] a carrier Mary was not the seed now you
[1:18:20] see what he's talking about the seed
[1:18:22] would be the fourth stage which is the
[1:18:26] revealed word that was the Lord Jesus
[1:18:29] Christ and still is the Lord Jesus
[1:18:32] Christ Mary she was only a carrier Mary
[1:18:41] was not the seed she was a carrier of
[1:18:43] the seed but she had nurtured brought
[1:18:48] forth out of her wound just like the
[1:18:52] show brought forth from the the wound
[1:18:56] that ordered a real seed I'm trying to
[1:19:03] find one let's see okay yeah but when
[1:19:06] you come to say I and my father are one
[1:19:11] and these other things the shuck pulls
[1:19:16] away from it but the real genuine bride
[1:19:20] Church will bring forth the entire Word
[1:19:25] of God in his fullness and its in its
[1:19:30] fullness and in its strength
[1:19:33] where he's the same yesterday today and
[1:19:36] forever the Bride of Christ we're not to
[1:19:43] be a carrier we're not to be a carrier
[1:19:50] of God's Word we are supposed to be the
[1:19:53] word that's alive in this day not a
[1:19:57] carrier the word that's alive and the
[1:19:59] day that we're living
[1:20:02] you see it's why some others day is a
[1:20:04] great thing because you see there's got
[1:20:07] to be a bride you talk about the bride
[1:20:10] of Luther Wright of Wesley bread a rod
[1:20:12] of Pinnacle but he's got to be a bride
[1:20:17] not one person not one group not one a
[1:20:20] worldwide bride is going to be the word
[1:20:28] you said well I just don't see it well
[1:20:30] no you wouldn't see it if you're
[1:20:31] standing back there with the Lord Jesus
[1:20:32] Christ when are we gonna get away from
[1:20:36] that if cold I don't see something does
[1:20:38] that mean it's not real are you about
[1:20:41] like that guy was I bad you know to get
[1:20:43] brother molten TV but no guy named dozer
[1:20:46] General Motors then bike earning the
[1:20:51] sixties you know and they went they went
[1:20:52] to the moon and everything in old dozer
[1:20:55] he said he'd it's nothing been gonna he
[1:20:57] said they it and go to the moon they
[1:20:59] just when I learned desert somewhere he
[1:21:02] said didn't believe it well you know
[1:21:05] brother Rodman what he says when they
[1:21:07] people say well I don't believe that he
[1:21:08] said it wouldn't fire you know does that
[1:21:18] put it
[1:21:18] do you enough I've told 50 years on one
[1:21:22] kind do you believe it but a bride of
[1:21:26] Jesus Christ in the last days would
[1:21:29] finish up as being the full son of man
[1:21:31] made manifest in a group of people to
[1:21:34] make her the fullness of the Godhead
[1:21:36] bodily
[1:21:37] do you believe that can you believe it
[1:21:42] cuz you see if you can believe it you're
[1:21:45] part of it
[1:21:45] if you can't believe it
[1:21:47] not part of it right I'm not trying to
[1:21:54] throw stones or slap nobody around to
[1:21:57] make them believe something I'm just
[1:21:58] trying to tell it like it is do we
[1:22:01] believe who we are
[1:22:02] I look for something else when we know
[1:22:08] where we're at and where we're standing
[1:22:13] let's see then don't worry about the
[1:22:15] enemy does this thing if it don't happen
[1:22:22] pretty quick you know what I'm talking
[1:22:23] about
[1:22:24] everybody's fussing this way and fussing
[1:22:26] that way about but you remember one time
[1:22:28] this economy can't keep going like it's
[1:22:30] going this thing can't keep running like
[1:22:36] it's running something got to take place
[1:22:38] be a perfect time for the Catholic
[1:22:40] Church to step in and pay off our debt
[1:22:45] I'm not seeing that's what they're gonna
[1:22:47] do but I'm saying that's one thing but
[1:22:48] you probably said one day they will okay
[1:22:51] I can say one day they will see then
[1:23:01] what are we gonna do
[1:23:07] who would have ever thought six months
[1:23:09] ago that you had trouble getting to
[1:23:13] church you know problems from different
[1:23:16] time who would have thought that you
[1:23:21] would have had a whole world brought to
[1:23:24] its knees not over one little virus come
[1:23:33] on church wake up at least a little bit
[1:23:36] you think one little virus that worked
[1:23:39] bothers me it's one little bug that is
[1:23:43] eaten away we can't come the palmer worm
[1:23:47] the locust the caterpillar that little
[1:23:51] bug is eating away at this message
[1:23:56] trying to destroy the fact of the word
[1:24:01] that's what I'm talking about
[1:24:06] what about Mother's Day we found that
[1:24:12] perfect mother now this message will
[1:24:17] produce a bride
[1:24:24] she'll be the word made flesh
[1:24:34] because he promised it come on musicians
[1:24:38] he promised it he said it would take
[1:24:42] place it's here appreciate these girls
[1:24:48] and all coming in and playing today and
[1:24:50] always really missed ins we missed all
[1:24:52] of you sisters you know when you're
[1:24:54] you're musicians and things like that
[1:24:57] cuz you know we were we were well we can
[1:25:00] do pretty good but it's still not as
[1:25:03] good as the is it sound today I was just
[1:25:06] setting our meditating a little bit when
[1:25:08] brother Joe walked in it was just
[1:25:09] something to listen and hear the music
[1:25:13] and hearing us back in church today back
[1:25:20] in church if they put us out we're no
[1:25:23] problem we'll find some other way I
[1:25:28] ain't worried about it they worried
[1:25:31] about what they're doing I'm concerned
[1:25:32] about what meaning you're doing as you
[1:25:37] see this is gonna prove what we are
[1:25:40] irregardless of what takes place do you
[1:25:42] agree with me this is gonna prove what
[1:25:45] we are we're gonna show what we are by
[1:25:47] what we do and how that we handle that
[1:25:52] you say what do you think I'm not saying
[1:25:54] nothing I'm just saying this is don't
[1:25:56] show what we are we're gonna prove what
[1:25:59] we are we're gonna manifest what we are
[1:26:02] going what we got less than
[1:26:07] [Music]

[1:27:31] him for it
[1:27:31] right father in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:27:36] we lay our hands upon our sister living
[1:27:39] your word that by your stripes he's
[1:27:41] healed now take away the problem the

[1:28:52] [Music]
[1:28:54] [Applause]

[1:29:19] the line and do what you're told to do
[1:29:23] remember services it's coming we need a
[1:29:25] brother Bob will be ministering for us
[1:29:28] and just pray that the Lord would bless
[1:29:33] but if you don't think of nothing about
[1:29:35] the service today you think a one time
[1:29:40] there is a was a woman pipes Mary the
[1:29:45] broader crop she's here to finish this
[1:29:50] thing up it'll all be done because she

[1:30:12] one without us they cannot be made
[1:30:16] perfect this is the finish of it there's
[1:30:22] probably one from another
