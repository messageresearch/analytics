[5:46] much for your many mercies and for your
[5:47] grace to a slow God and we know Lord
[5:49] Jesus Eve calls us to be a special
[5:51] people with a special privileges Lord
[5:53] and tonight Lord I believe that one of
[5:55] our special privileges Lord is to have a
[5:57] to be able to feast on that hidden manna
[5:59] that special revelation of your word has
[6:01] been stored up until this day Lord God
[6:03] the Lord we come expecting tonight Lord
[6:06] Jesus expecting to look into your word
[6:08] expecting to receive something in Lord
[6:10] and expecting to be changed that's my
[6:12] desire Lord God every time we come to
[6:14] the house of the Lord to be changed Lord
[6:16] Jesus something within me to fall away
[6:17] the old man to fall away and Lord that
[6:20] for your word to come to come to life
[6:22] within me Lord more and more every time
[6:24] we come to fellowship Lord Jesus and I
[6:27] pray the Lord is tonight Lord Jesus
[6:29] you'll do something special for your
[6:30] people or God and maybe some the lost
[6:33] would realize that they don't have what
[6:34] they think they have and maybe the ones
[6:36] that do have something will realize what
[6:38] they do have Lord God and I pray Lord
[6:40] that you'll just be with us all tonight
[6:42] Lord God and open up the ears of the
[6:44] hears Lord Jesus and open up my mouth or
[6:46] speaker truth Lord God granted Lord that
[6:49] you'll put your words in my mouth
[6:50] tonight Lord Jesus and she'll be with us
[6:52] and bless our gathering Lord Jesus we
[6:54] pray and we ask this blessing over your
[6:56] word in the name of the Lord Jesus
[6:57] Christ amen
[7:01] Matthew chapter 26 verse 34 to 46 and it
[7:05] says at third verse 34 jesus said unto
[7:09] Him verily I say unto thee that this
[7:12] night before the crow thou shalt
[7:14] deny me thrice Peter said unto him
[7:16] though I should die with thee yet will I
[7:19] not deny thee likewise I also said all
[7:22] the disciples he is very boastful
[7:26] I believe Peter was about to come to a
[7:28] realization that maybe he didn't quite
[7:30] have what he thought he did then come
[7:33] with Jesus with him unto a place called
[7:35] Gethsemane and saith unto the disciples
[7:37] sit ye here while I go and pray Andre
[7:40] and he took with him Peter and the two
[7:42] sons of Zebedee and began to be
[7:44] sorrowful and very heavy then say a
[7:47] thing under them my soul is exceeding
[7:48] sorrowful even unto death tear you here
[7:51] and watch with me and he went a little
[7:53] further and fell on his face and prayed
[7:55] saying O my father if it be possible let
[7:58] this cup pass from me nevertheless not
[8:00] as I will but as thou wilt and he cometh
[8:04] under the disciples and findeth him
[8:06] asleep and saith unto Peter what could
[8:08] you not watch with me one hour watch and
[8:11] pray that ye enter not into temptation
[8:13] the spirit indeed is willing but the
[8:15] flesh is weak he went away the second
[8:18] time and prayed saying O my father if
[8:20] this cup may not pass away from me
[8:22] except I drink it thy will be done and
[8:25] he came and found him asleep again for
[8:27] their eyes were heavy and he left them
[8:30] and went away again and prayed the third
[8:31] time saying the same words then cometh
[8:34] he to his disciples and saith unto them
[8:36] sleep on now and take your rest
[8:38] behold the hours at hand and the Son of
[8:41] Man is betrayed into the hands of
[8:42] sinners rise and let us be going behold
[8:46] he is at hand that does betray me he may
[8:49] be seated the Lord out his blessing to
[8:51] the reading of the word now maybe just
[9:00] to get a little bit of context of the
[9:02] scripture before I kind of get into them
[9:03] into the message tonight is that Jesus
[9:06] this was really the culmination of
[9:08] Jesus's life the thing that he was been
[9:09] had been born to fulfill was to give his
[9:12] life on the cross and now it had gone
[9:15] through you you can kind of see the
[9:17] journey this every every believers got
[9:19] to go through the same journey that
[9:21] Christ went through the same baptized on
[9:23] the river Jordan
[9:24] adopted on the mountain on all of the
[9:26] different things that that show the
[9:28] progression of a believer especially in
[9:30] this age because in this sage we've got
[9:32] access to the headstone something that
[9:34] all that although all the other Church
[9:35] ages we're looking for it but
[9:38] we have access to this the complete
[9:40] journey of Jesus Christ and now he comes
[9:42] to the end of the road and and and the
[9:44] thing that he had been born to fulfill
[9:46] and and brother Brent talks about how he
[9:48] battles like a battle in the garden
[9:50] because Gethsemane means the depressing
[9:52] place the place where the wine is
[9:55] pressed out and so there in that back in
[9:58] that garden he began to battle and you
[10:00] could see maybe the devil over there
[10:01] sitting waiting in the wings to see is
[10:03] he really gonna go through with it
[10:05] is he gonna really give his life is he
[10:07] and maybe brother enema s he dramatized
[10:10] that he would say well you know Jesus is
[10:12] there praying and calling out to the
[10:15] Father asking is there is there may be
[10:17] another way that this can be fulfilled
[10:19] do I have to give my life is there maybe
[10:21] somebody else could give their life or
[10:23] something else could be done to save
[10:25] these people that were lost back there
[10:27] in the Garden of Eden that is there
[10:29] anything else that could be done and any
[10:31] he pray through and he began to began to
[10:34] call out and and because what he's doing
[10:37] is he's he's battling through the last
[10:40] remaining vestige of any kind of
[10:42] anything in his humanity that would
[10:44] prevent him from feeling it fulfilling
[10:46] God's Word you said when he came through
[10:49] that battle when he came through that
[10:50] battle and stepped out see the battle
[10:53] was over he had all he had to do was
[10:55] just go fulfill the Word of God all he
[10:57] had to do was just go walk to the cross
[10:59] because the battle was won there in the
[11:01] Garden of Gethsemane the battle was won
[11:03] and so when he stepped his foot out of
[11:05] that garden what you see there is a life
[11:08] above the life released a life above God
[11:10] of power and that's really where I'm
[11:13] getting my money the title of the night
[11:15] sermon the greatest sermon ever preached
[11:17] the greatest sermon ever preached would
[11:20] be the life of Christ on display where
[11:23] the whole word the devil himself could
[11:25] look at the life of cross being
[11:27] displayed in the man and say there goes
[11:29] a real Christian there goes a real son
[11:32] and daughter of God and as you see as
[11:35] Jesus put his life on display and took
[11:37] that journey to the cross all the people
[11:40] that looked at him could not help but be
[11:42] influenced by this man's life by the
[11:44] actions that he took so let's let's kind
[11:47] of follow him as he walked as he took
[11:49] this journey to the cross
[11:50] in Matthew 26 48 through 50 it says now
[11:54] he that betrayed him gave them a sign
[11:56] saying whomsoever I shall kiss that same
[12:00] as he hold him fast and forthwith he
[12:03] came to Jesus and said hail master and
[12:06] kiss him now let's just think about this
[12:08] look this is the man that had been in
[12:10] the ranks of the disciples and posed as
[12:12] a real believer and now had been had was
[12:15] going to be the one to betray Jesus now
[12:17] if you think think about the way that
[12:19] brother Branham treated people that
[12:20] hated him think about the way that Jews
[12:23] that Jesus treated this man that
[12:26] betrayed and that sold him for thirty
[12:28] pieces of silver here he is betraying
[12:30] him with a kiss and Jesus responds with
[12:32] the word friend friend where for that
[12:35] heart now come the life of Christ was
[12:37] the life of God was so displayed in this
[12:40] man that you could not tell who his
[12:42] enemy were when he said they're at
[12:44] communion with all of his disciples
[12:46] the disciples were wandering within
[12:49] themselves at me that's going to betray
[12:50] him who's he talking about they didn't
[12:53] say it was Judas they could not tell who
[12:55] Jesus knew who who it was that was going
[12:59] to betray him listen if you if you
[13:01] friends if we could have a life of
[13:03] Christ so displayed like that well you
[13:05] can't tell who your enemy is well you
[13:08] can't tell you you secretly are
[13:10] wondering about it you secretly wondered
[13:12] what is this one a real genuine believer
[13:15] or not but you know so many times this
[13:18] is so visible and on display who we like
[13:21] and who we don't like before conform
[13:23] cliques and form clans and we like this
[13:25] person we like that person but with
[13:27] Jesus you couldn't tell you couldn't
[13:29] tell who his friend wasn't who who was
[13:31] enemy was I was I was wondering whether
[13:38] this was going to preach or teach
[13:39] tonight so let me see if I can calm down
[13:41] so I can deliver this a little bit in
[13:44] Luke chapter 22 verse 49 to 51 it says
[13:47] when they which were about him saw what
[13:49] would follow they said unto Him Lord
[13:51] shall we smite with the sword so they
[13:54] came they came to take him away and his
[13:57] disciples began to realize that he was
[13:58] there to take him and Peter's response
[14:01] Peters response was select so many
[14:04] people in the message so many people on
[14:06] the run to believe in campus I got a
[14:08] sword in my hand I know what to do with
[14:10] it I'm just going to start whacking with
[14:12] it and it says one of them smoke the
[14:14] servant of the high priest and cut off
[14:16] his right ear you know so many times
[14:22] somebody tell you no the sword of the
[14:24] world that God has given into our hand
[14:26] is not for us to smite our brothers it's
[14:28] not for us to smite the service of the
[14:29] high priest he gave us the sword of the
[14:31] world to smite the devil with it but
[14:33] it's not to smite one another and he
[14:35] give us that word so many times we don't
[14:37] which seems like we don't know what to
[14:39] do with it and I believe that's what the
[14:41] new birth is given for the new birth is
[14:43] given to give us wisdom to know what to
[14:45] do with the word with the theology that
[14:47] we built with the doctrine that we've
[14:49] been given to know what to do with the
[14:51] mechanics that we've been given to know
[14:52] how to drive the car how to pilot how to
[14:54] pilot it how to do it how to move in the
[14:58] right channels with the right approach
[14:59] to God is and jesus answered and said
[15:02] suffer you thus far as in other words
[15:04] that's it that's enough of that and he
[15:06] touched his ear and He healed him he
[15:08] pictures they reach down and he picked
[15:10] his ear up and he put his ear but you
[15:12] know so many times it seems like that's
[15:14] what the ministry kind of has to do or a
[15:16] believers come back behind other other
[15:18] believers are scar and other ones that
[15:20] they have to smooth things over patch
[15:22] the patch everything up the pastor has
[15:24] to come come around behind somebody
[15:26] that's causing the scar it's causing a
[15:28] great big turmoil smooth everything up
[15:30] heal everything heal the wounds but
[15:34] brother if we could have really the life
[15:36] of Christ on display in our life the
[15:39] life of Christ where we could love one
[15:41] another and really really show meekness
[15:43] and humility and had put the others
[15:45] before ourselves and Luke chapter 22
[15:49] verse 54 says then they took him and
[15:51] laid him and brought him into the high
[15:53] priests house it seems like so many
[15:57] times we weren't able to be laid we want
[16:00] our way we would rather take our way
[16:01] than the gospel way when we read the
[16:03] message we like I like I don't know if
[16:06] that's what it says we'll come to church
[16:07] to listen to the pastor listen to the
[16:09] minister well I don't know if that's
[16:10] quite what that says and we'll argue
[16:12] with the word but if you can be in
[16:14] subjection to the world and allow
[16:15] you like a lamb oh we're sheep
[16:19] we've got to be led but well you know
[16:21] we'll struggle and fight and stress
[16:23] about things well instead of just
[16:25] allowing the Shepherd to lead us and
[16:29] keep on reading to verse 63 and the men
[16:31] that held Jesus mocked him and smote him
[16:33] and when they had blindfolded him they
[16:35] struck him on the face and asked him
[16:37] saying prophesy who is it that smoked
[16:40] thee and you see Jesus allowed them to
[16:43] smite him on this cheek and mocks him
[16:45] and call him things and we can barely
[16:47] suffer somebody to disagree with our
[16:49] doctrine if somebody from another church
[16:51] says well I disagree with you did we get
[16:53] all riled up and begin to get off stinky
[16:55] within ourselves and I just fuss and
[16:57] fume about things because we can't
[16:58] hardly we can't hardly stand for
[17:00] somebody to disagree with us it seems
[17:02] like listen if Jesus was able to be
[17:05] mocked and slapped across the face and
[17:07] and humiliated publicly before people
[17:09] can't we stand a little chastise but
[17:11] can't we stand a little rebuke you know
[17:16] brother Brown said and from that time he
[17:18] said today we got the wrong conception
[17:20] of power power is overcoming returning
[17:23] good for evil that's real power that can
[17:26] love your enemy do good to those that do
[17:29] evil to you that's real power that's God
[17:32] power and I want to say that's a real
[17:34] that's the greatest sermon that could
[17:36] ever be preached
[17:37] that's a sermon that will convict your
[17:39] family that will cause your loved ones
[17:41] to come to God a sermon that will
[17:43] because look love is what caused the
[17:46] bull to stop in his trap love is what
[17:49] caused the ELA jackets to return back in
[17:51] their hole love is what will cause your
[17:53] family to realize that there's something
[17:54] to this message I think sometimes we
[17:56] want to approach other people that
[17:58] disagree with us like Peter with that
[17:59] sword whacking off body parts but if we
[18:02] just love one another love is the great
[18:04] Conqueror and I tell you you can't how
[18:07] can you love somebody unless you've got
[18:09] that real pillar of fire down on the
[18:11] inside of your soul the life of Christ
[18:13] down on you to manifest the greatest
[18:15] sermon that could ever be preached to
[18:17] preach a sermon of love to other people
[18:19] have you can't manifest that unless
[18:22] you're born again I believe that's what
[18:24] the new birth was given forward to
[18:25] manifest the love of Christ to manifest
[18:27] the life of
[18:28] Christ to preach a sermon to other
[18:30] people that will cause them to realize
[18:32] that there really is something true to
[18:34] this message you know you hear people
[18:38] say that people are beginning to lose
[18:40] faith and and what what the new birth
[18:43] really is they're losing confidence that
[18:45] the new birth can can take you away from
[18:48] the things of this world all these
[18:50] doctors that are starting up about it
[18:51] well even after the new birth you still
[18:53] gonna have trouble with with pornography
[18:55] and adultery and all this kind of thing
[18:57] that's a bunch of tommyrot when you gets
[18:59] a new birth it'll still a purge all that
[19:01] stuff out of you that's what we need the
[19:02] new birth for brother Branham said in
[19:10] divine love and Sovereign Grace he said
[19:12] I'd say Lord take all the gifts and let
[19:15] me have the love see for no matter how
[19:18] many gifts we got they will never do us
[19:20] any good except the love of God is the
[19:22] motive behind the gift we must have
[19:25] loved the life of Christ manifested in
[19:31] that man and if the life of Christ could
[19:34] be manifested in that man he could be
[19:35] manifest in us too because he's given us
[19:37] power through the new birth
[19:41] let's read in Luke chapter 23 mmm-hmm
[19:45] because then he was taken before Pilate
[19:48] and it says in Pilate me when he had
[19:50] called together the chief priests and
[19:51] the rulers and the people said unto them
[19:54] you have brought this man unto me as one
[19:57] that perverted the people and behold I
[20:00] having examined him before you have
[20:02] found no fault in this man touching
[20:05] these things whereof ye accuse him in
[20:07] other words the devil or the Roman
[20:09] system the Roman government had had
[20:11] himself examined this man listen you've
[20:14] got to face the hall of critics too you
[20:15] have to be examined by the devil because
[20:17] brother Graham said that you could get
[20:19] to a place a believer could get to a
[20:20] place a believer can grow into a place
[20:23] where the devil don't know what to do
[20:25] with you and the devil's looking her all
[20:27] around he knows all of your weak spots
[20:29] and he's examining you trying to find a
[20:31] way to get to you but when you grow into
[20:33] a place into the statue of a perfect man
[20:35] into the statue of Christ where Christ
[20:37] is manifesting himself through you
[20:40] manifesting the works of God through
[20:42] your members and the devil looks at you
[20:44] and said I don't know what to do with
[20:45] this man then you'll be like Pilate
[20:47] examining as I said looking at Jesus and
[20:50] saying I've examined this man and I find
[20:52] no fault in him in other words he is so
[20:54] justified that I can't I can't find
[20:57] anything this man is just this man has
[21:00] come to a place of justification that I
[21:02] don't even know I can't even look at all
[21:05] the way back in his life I can't find
[21:06] anything wrong listen we're coming to a
[21:10] place where a place of justification
[21:13] whether real you never did it to begin
[21:15] with
[21:15] you never the real you never did it to
[21:18] begin with
[21:18] he said no nor had Herod for I sent you
[21:22] to him and lo nothing worthy of death is
[21:24] done unto Him neither Pilate nor Herod
[21:28] could find any fault in this man because
[21:31] see the life of Christ the life of God
[21:34] was being manifested in this met through
[21:36] this man so much that all through this
[21:39] journey from the Garden of Gethsemane to
[21:41] the cross he was influencing people he
[21:43] was influencing Peter he was influencing
[21:46] Pilate and Herod he was influencing the
[21:49] thief on the cross and Luke 23 it says
[21:53] in one of the malefactors which were
[21:54] hanged railed on him saying if thou be
[21:56] Christ save thyself and us but the other
[22:00] answering rebuked him saying just not
[22:02] thou fear God seeing thou art in the
[22:04] same condemnation and we indeed justly
[22:06] for we receive the due reward of our
[22:10] water our deeds but this man hath done
[22:12] nothing amiss and he said unto Jesus
[22:15] Lord remember me when thou comest into
[22:17] thy kingdom and Jesus said unto Him
[22:20] verily I say unto thee today thou shalt
[22:22] be with me in paradise in other words
[22:25] listen Jesus was not preaching a great
[22:28] big sermon Jesus did not have to tell
[22:31] the thief on the cross he did not have
[22:32] to expound to him all the mysteries and
[22:34] all the things that expects playing all
[22:36] this great deep doctrine all the thief
[22:38] did was he looked at that man he just
[22:40] turned and the life was bone display so
[22:43] much that he was convicted with an m7 he
[22:46] said this man we're guilty but this man
[22:48] is
[22:49] listen if we could live a life with the
[22:52] life of Christ was so much on display
[22:54] that when you're walking through your
[22:56] workplace we're carrying your little
[22:58] lunch box when you're just going about
[23:00] your daily duties like the drunk man
[23:02] there brother Brent talked about they
[23:03] came home and his wife was just singing
[23:05] there she watched on the Worcester floor
[23:07] and and the man and his friend that was
[23:10] with him was so convicted that they fell
[23:12] on their face and gave their heart to
[23:14] the Lord that that is the life of Christ
[23:15] on display
[23:16] that's a soul and in life that's the
[23:18] kind of life that other people going to
[23:20] look to and say ah there's got to be
[23:22] something to this that's that's the
[23:25] greatest sermon that could ever be
[23:27] preached when Jesus when he had cried in
[23:30] Matthew 27 and verse 52 54 Jesus when he
[23:34] had cried again with a loud voice
[23:35] yielded up the ghost and behold the veil
[23:38] of the temple was rent in twain from the
[23:40] top to the bottom of the earth to quake
[23:43] and the rocks rent and the graves were
[23:45] opened and many bodies of the saints
[23:47] which slept arose and came out of the
[23:49] graves after he's a resurrection and
[23:51] went into the holy city and appeared on
[23:53] the Meeny now when the Centurion and
[23:56] they that were with him watching Jesus
[23:59] saw the earthquake and these things that
[24:03] were done they feared greatly saying
[24:06] truly this was the son of God the
[24:09] Centurion and all that were with him saw
[24:11] all these things that were done and it
[24:13] wasn't that they heard a great big
[24:15] sermon preached but they saw the sermon
[24:18] of his life lived and they were
[24:20] convicted they knew that something had
[24:22] to be to have taken this was no ordinary
[24:23] man and it's no ordinary man when an
[24:27] adopted son of God a so adopted child of
[24:30] God walks on the earth it's no ordinary
[24:32] man when when brother Branham spoke to
[24:35] the wind and and it's the snowstorm and
[24:37] had moved back when he spoke to the
[24:38] little fishie and his life with the life
[24:41] of that little fishie came back into
[24:43] itself it's no ordinary man with a real
[24:46] child of God was walking on the earth
[24:47] moving in the life of Christ is made
[24:49] manifest in them that's the greatest
[24:52] sermon ever preached listen there is
[24:56] power than the Holy Ghost there's power
[24:58] in the life lived by the by the
[25:00] word is power this is not just some
[25:03] psychology I think so many times people
[25:05] try to find the problem in their life or
[25:08] in their family or their loved ones but
[25:10] trying to go fight go back to psychology
[25:13] listen let's see if we can get to the
[25:14] root of the problem what do you think
[25:16] about this what do you think about that
[25:18] I think so many times the problem is
[25:20] that we need to go back to whether or
[25:22] not you're born again or not the way the
[25:24] problem of adultery and fornication and
[25:27] all these sin all this sinful living our
[25:29] lack of holiness it's not that you're
[25:31] not just just thinking about the May
[25:33] issue right that's not that you don't
[25:35] listen you deal with whether or not be
[25:36] you're a Republican or Democrat or all
[25:38] those kind of things the problem goes
[25:40] back to the soul problem it's a
[25:42] Salvation issue it's a problem whether
[25:44] or not the life of Christ is abiding
[25:46] down on your soul or not I think so many
[25:50] times we have we made we made that we
[25:52] will make the new birth something that
[25:54] is not we made it just like learning
[25:56] about things we've made it education we
[25:58] made it well you just come to church and
[26:00] just learn about learn about the word
[26:01] and everything but it's the life of
[26:03] Christ manifested in the believer it's
[26:06] God living inside of you
[26:13] listen brother Bram said he said in his
[26:17] your life worthy of the gospel he said
[26:19] oh God
[26:19] let me behold both my hands to God
[26:22] before this audience let me live like
[26:24] that let this word so become that me and
[26:27] this word is the same thing let my words
[26:29] be this word let the meditation in my
[26:31] heart let him be in my heart
[26:33] on my mind tie his Commandments to upon
[26:36] this the post of my intelligence tie
[26:38] them upon the posts in my heart let me
[26:40] just see him when temptation Rises let
[26:43] me see Christ when things go wrong let
[26:46] me just see him when I get ready and
[26:48] then enemy enemy try to make me get
[26:49] angry let me see Jesus what would he do
[26:52] what would he want the life of Christ to
[26:55] be made manifest in me because brother
[26:57] branham sitting in the ephesian church
[26:58] change he said a life lived by the word
[27:01] would be the word express in other words
[27:05] it's a sermon being preached
[27:06] it's a expression the very expression of
[27:09] the Eternal Word
[27:11] in the beginning was the word and the
[27:12] Word was with God and the Word was God
[27:14] and that word expressly lived out in the
[27:16] believer just lived without maybe even
[27:19] say anything is an expression of God to
[27:21] the people the works that I do bear
[27:25] witness of me brother and priest in 1951
[27:27] he said do you know I'd rather you live
[27:30] me a sermon than preach me one it'll be
[27:32] a better evidence that you're a
[27:34] Christian isn't that right to live a
[27:36] sermon and what we are is what we live
[27:39] what we do our actions shows what we are
[27:41] and God keeps his word in 1957 he said I
[27:44] tell you the reason I love to hear
[27:46] brother Neville speak not mainly because
[27:48] he's a good preacher but because I know
[27:50] that he lives what he preaches and I
[27:53] would rather you would live me a sermon
[27:55] than preach me one it'll be more
[27:57] effective it'll be more effective in
[28:01] another place he talks about brother
[28:02] Neville and he says I've searched his
[28:04] life back how would you like to have
[28:06] your life searched back by prophet and
[28:07] he said I've searched his life back and
[28:09] he's actually living what he's preaching
[28:11] and the lamb in the dove 1957 brother
[28:15] Branham said now no matter how much you
[28:16] preach you got a real ill temper don't
[28:20] do you much good to preach you see no
[28:22] matter how much you joined church and
[28:24] try to impersonate if you're crabbing
[28:26] and nasty with your neighbour you'll
[28:28] never win into Christ then see it's the
[28:31] fruit of the Spirit as my wife used to
[28:33] tell me actions speak louder than words
[28:35] that's right
[28:36] leave me a sermon instead of preaching
[28:38] me one that's a good thing to live me a
[28:40] sermon and I believe that this message
[28:43] has given us the power to live a sermon
[28:45] where we could we could look at a
[28:47] believers life and be amazed at the
[28:49] power of God that would give them that
[28:52] kind of patience that kind of temperance
[28:55] where somebody would say something
[28:57] horrible to you or disagree with you or
[28:59] whatever and the life of God is so
[29:01] flowing through you that somebody would
[29:03] be amazed at the amount of patience that
[29:06] will be manifest in that believers life
[29:08] I believe that's what the little kind of
[29:10] life that we should be that we should
[29:12] strive for because listen the reason
[29:15] that people the the world is hungry and
[29:18] thirsting for a real life the life of
[29:21] Christ on display and that's what that's
[29:23] what causes P
[29:24] to come to church what causes people to
[29:26] come to church and follow after the the
[29:28] gospel that you proclaim to believe is a
[29:30] fire burnin I imagine maybe one time
[29:35] when when the children of Israel me just
[29:39] talk brother ba the children of history
[29:42] were down in Egypt in and they were
[29:44] putting the land that killing the lamb
[29:46] and putting the blood over the lintel of
[29:47] their door and maybe there might be a
[29:49] little prodigal son wandering by and
[29:51] wandering by his parents home that night
[29:53] and he looked in and he saw a fire
[29:55] blazing and what was on that fire was a
[29:58] lamb being roasted and that lamb was the
[30:00] attraction for them maybe it maybe it's
[30:02] time for me to come home maybe it's time
[30:04] for me to turn in and you see the fire
[30:06] the fire the gospel is what attracts
[30:09] people with somebody come to church and
[30:11] they see a church on fire a Church of
[30:13] the Living God being made manifest so
[30:15] that'll make somebody hunger and thirst
[30:16] when they see a the fire of God the fire
[30:19] of God is what they followed in the
[30:21] wilderness they followed that pillar of
[30:23] fire but that fire of God has put inside
[30:25] of you the believers through the New
[30:27] Testament covenant
[30:30] what is that fire the fire manifests
[30:33] love you meant that story that brother
[30:34] Brown I'm told about Burt call that he
[30:37] said the meanest man and he and he and
[30:39] he went out there any hunting and he'd
[30:40] always tried to be real mean to brother
[30:43] branham money and you know try to kill
[30:45] the little baby deers when it it didn't
[30:47] even need any meat or anything and
[30:49] brother branham said one one time he got
[30:51] that little call and he could call the
[30:53] little deer out and and a mother deer
[30:55] the little mama deer with all that love
[30:58] of a mother stepped out and said I would
[31:03] be willing to die I know there's a
[31:06] hundred he saw the love with that little
[31:08] mother deer step out and he knew that if
[31:11] a little mama deer could love its baby
[31:13] that much that there had to be the love
[31:15] of God so that's the love that their
[31:17] brother branham and they'd be talking
[31:18] about the love he saw real love on
[31:21] display when somebody comes to church
[31:23] and they see real Christian love on
[31:25] display they see that's the fire of the
[31:27] gospel they don't draw him to the word
[31:29] that are drawn and then they'll know
[31:32] that it's not just words on a page
[31:34] because listen you can't get warm by
[31:36] painted fire you can't get warm by just
[31:38] ink on the page just think but when you
[31:42] come when you see the wink as it risen
[31:46] off of the page and it's room Ana
[31:48] festered in the life of a believer you
[31:51] can you can barely up around that and
[31:53] warm your hands by that that's something
[31:56] that'll be a benefit to a believer or an
[31:59] unbeliever anybody Monica said one time
[32:09] when I was preaching somewhere she said
[32:11] I thought you about to pass out
[32:12] breathing in the combat Olivia I'm all
[32:21] right so I'm gonna changed direction a
[32:28] little bit and and talked about you see
[32:34] when the in in the Old Testament when a
[32:37] believer a believer would be or an
[32:40] unbeliever either way would be attracted
[32:43] by the fire of the tabernacle so now I'm
[32:46] kind of getting into what I was talking
[32:47] about in Sunday school but attracted
[32:49] attracted to that that at brazen altar
[32:52] that was sitting out there in the out of
[32:54] court
[32:54] I see all those things you you want to
[32:57] have the life of Christ what what you
[32:59] need to do is go look at that Tabernacle
[33:00] and see the experience of the believer
[33:03] going through because each one of those
[33:05] little pit furniture in the tabernacle
[33:07] it's one of those furnishings speaks of
[33:09] the walk of the believer are going
[33:10] through and the first step is to look at
[33:12] that brazen altar and say there's a fire
[33:14] burning there's a fire burning and then
[33:16] attracts you there's a fire burning and
[33:18] there's a lamb being roasted or there's
[33:20] a sacrifice being offered and the
[33:21] believer the unbeliever turns aside and
[33:23] they go through that gate of the outer
[33:25] court because jesus said i am the gate i
[33:28] am the door By Me If any man enter in he
[33:31] shall be saved and shall go in and out
[33:32] and find pasture and so you turn aside
[33:35] and go through that gate and you begin
[33:37] that journey you're getting taken one
[33:39] step after the other but that first step
[33:41] of the believer is the odd is that
[33:43] brazen altar
[33:47] that how our hand is moving off a fast
[33:49] yeah
[33:50] if y'all want to pull that pull that one
[33:52] of those slides up in the brazen altar I
[33:54] don't have a number anything so if you
[33:55] can't find it that's fine
[33:57] if you can there you go so they come to
[33:59] the Braves and why is that the very
[34:01] first thing when you're coming through
[34:02] that outer court the very first thing
[34:04] that a believer comes across is the
[34:06] brazen altar because your whole
[34:07] Christian journey is based upon that
[34:09] sacrifice Jesus given his life on the
[34:11] cross for you and when you look back as
[34:14] you're taking that journey and you
[34:15] remember I was there when I when I
[34:17] identified myself with the sacrifice I
[34:20] was there when I recognized the
[34:21] sacrifice that Jesus made for me I
[34:24] remember that he I know that he paid the
[34:27] price for all of my sins and all of my
[34:29] sins have been washed away all of my
[34:31] sins are covered by the blood of the
[34:33] sacrifice you see how important it is to
[34:35] recognize what Jesus has done for you
[34:38] we're not here just to learn about all
[34:40] the all sorts of interesting facts but
[34:42] we're here to learn about the price that
[34:44] Jesus paid for us I tend to be
[34:47] identified with him
[34:52] you see that fire that fire on the altar
[34:57] represents there's got to be a fire in
[34:59] the church to cause people to be
[35:02] attracted to it you say I think I think
[35:05] many times people get confused by
[35:07] statements that brother Branham made
[35:08] about how he'd say we were weird beyond
[35:11] Pentecost now and he said I'll read it
[35:13] for you where he said he said we're
[35:15] living we're living ahead of that now we
[35:18] are beyond Pentecost the same as we are
[35:21] Methodists and Lutheran and see people
[35:23] began to get in their head that we don't
[35:25] need the fire of Pentecost anymore we're
[35:28] beyond that he's not talking about the
[35:30] original Pentecost he's not talking
[35:32] about the original faith of the
[35:34] disciples he's talking about their Zuza
[35:36] Street Pentecost we moved ahead from
[35:38] from Lutheran Methodist the Pentecostal
[35:42] and they denominated they form
[35:43] denominations and we just that the word
[35:46] has kept moving on but we're not moving
[35:48] on Pat we're the the Malachi message was
[35:51] sent to restore us back to the original
[35:53] faith of the fathers to that original
[35:56] fire and that original fire should be
[35:58] burning
[35:59] in the heart of every believer you see
[36:04] this outer court when a believer when an
[36:07] unbeliever begins to go through this
[36:09] outer court a lot of times they mistake
[36:11] it's like it's like somebody a little a
[36:13] little young person going to a youth
[36:15] camp and they get in that fire and they
[36:17] begin to see supernatural things and
[36:19] they begin to maybe go through the
[36:21] prayer line and come out and actually
[36:23] see the pillar of fire listen I'll tell
[36:25] you what if you get to talking to some
[36:27] of the young people they have seen and
[36:29] heard and and experienced very many
[36:32] supernatural things supernatural things
[36:36] that would let it astound you really I
[36:37] was talking to one of the young people
[36:39] I'm not gonna embarrass you or call your
[36:40] name or anything but after youth meaning
[36:42] they came out of the service and they
[36:43] begin to hear a heavenly choir sing and
[36:46] sing a song and they could tell you what
[36:47] song it was and began to rejoice in the
[36:50] spirit listen there's there's
[36:51] supernatural things taking place when
[36:53] you that fire was lit by supernatural
[36:57] God it was not lit by man but will you
[36:59] get out in the outer court and you see
[37:00] the supernatural things you become begin
[37:02] to think well I'm born again or you can
[37:05] maybe come back from a youth camp and
[37:07] and maybe the people that that were not
[37:10] there when u s-- experienced
[37:12] supernatural things with will will tell
[37:14] you what you didn't get nothing you
[37:17] didn't get nothing I want to take maybe
[37:18] you didn't get the new birth but I tell
[37:20] you what when something like that
[37:22] happens you didn't get nothing you don't
[37:24] come back when somebody tells you you
[37:26] didn't get nothing I'll tell you what
[37:28] you just got to do like Ava did David
[37:30] didn't when they stole all his wives and
[37:32] stole as possession doesn't say bring me
[37:33] the ephod I'm gonna take God's Word I'm
[37:36] gonna ignore all the criticism I'm going
[37:38] to know all the naysayers and I'm just
[37:40] gonna march on with God I don't care
[37:42] what others say if you tell me I didn't
[37:44] get nothing when I know that I got when
[37:46] I I know that something supernatural
[37:48] took place listen sometimes God does
[37:51] something for us maybe even in our flesh
[37:53] maybe just an anointing on our flesh
[37:54] just to let us know that he cares about
[37:57] us and sometimes when I'm feeling bad it
[37:59] might not be something down in my soul
[38:01] but just a little quickening to my flesh
[38:02] I just thank God for it a blessing to my
[38:05] flesh will help carry you through the
[38:07] bad times sometimes I appreciate
[38:09] everything that I can get from God
[38:19] Ezekiel 36 it says I will take you from
[38:21] among the heathen which is what he's
[38:23] doing when you come into that outer
[38:24] court and he says I will sprinkle clean
[38:26] water upon you and ye shall be clean
[38:28] from all your filthiness and from all
[38:30] your your idols will I cleanse you a new
[38:32] heart also will I give you in a new
[38:34] spirit I will put with you and I will
[38:36] take away the stony heart out of your
[38:37] flesh and I will give you a heart of
[38:39] flesh and see that scriptures what is
[38:41] that what is being fulfilled as you walk
[38:43] through the courts and you start off
[38:46] with that brazen altar and then you move
[38:47] on to the Laver because this the the
[38:50] believer has to be washed just like the
[38:52] priest was washed and you go down into
[38:54] the water just like Jesus what he was
[38:56] there at the river Jordan and John
[38:58] baptized him and he said I'm we've got
[38:59] to fulfill all the scripture all of
[39:01] righteousness has to be fulfilled and
[39:03] the believer has got to be washed
[39:05] you know when the children of Israel
[39:06] were coming out of Egypt they they crew
[39:08] that they killed the lamb they put the
[39:10] blood over the door and then they went
[39:12] through that there's the blade Bray's
[39:14] and see they rent went through the sea
[39:16] and as the sea washed away all of those
[39:20] Egyptians they could look back and say
[39:22] that all of our troubles that all of
[39:24] that all of that life all of that has
[39:26] been washed away when you go through
[39:28] that brazen sea - and wash why every
[39:31] time you come into the outer court every
[39:33] time you come to worship you must be
[39:35] washed of all the filthiness of the
[39:37] world wash it away wash it away by the
[39:39] water of the word that's how you wash it
[39:42] away the cleansing by the water of the
[39:44] word and then you have a right to enter
[39:45] into the holy place and as I watched
[39:49] that time slip around I'm trying to
[39:51] speed up a little bit but I want to just
[39:56] pause here for a moment because what I'm
[39:58] talking about is justification
[39:59] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[40:02] Ghost and sometimes it can enter into
[40:05] people's minds that well I've heard all
[40:07] this before this is a very simple
[40:09] message about justification
[40:10] sanctification badges my holy gifts why
[40:13] do I need to hear this over and over
[40:16] again because that the simplicity of the
[40:19] gospel is what your whole journey is
[40:21] based on
[40:23] if you fail to see st. justification
[40:26] sanctification the baptism the Holy
[40:27] Ghost you are missing the message and
[40:30] you're missing the mystery of the
[40:32] message there's a mystery hidden within
[40:34] justification just sanctification the
[40:37] baptism the Holy Ghost y'all not getting
[40:39] tired on me are you hang on now listen
[40:42] you've got to hit all the milestones
[40:45] because listen you could come to the
[40:47] church and you hear a preacher preaching
[40:49] this is the age of the son of man this
[40:51] is the age of adoption and you can you
[40:53] can get it within your head went into
[40:54] yourself well why I'm adopted I'm
[40:58] already but listen when a preacher is
[41:01] preaching with it from within the Holy
[41:02] of Holies he's trying to identify you
[41:04] with all of these different milestones
[41:06] and unless you have a personal
[41:09] experience with the golden altar and
[41:12] with the lampstands and with the table
[41:13] of showbread and with the brazen altar
[41:16] and with all these different way points
[41:18] you cannot say that you've already you
[41:20] come into the Holy of Holies you have to
[41:23] be able to look back and say I remember
[41:24] my experience with the left and I
[41:27] remember my experience at the brazen
[41:30] altar
[41:30] I remember being identified with my
[41:32] sacrifice
[41:33] I remember my sins being washed away at
[41:35] the Laver I remember studying the word
[41:38] at the table of showbread and pondering
[41:40] over things that I didn't understand and
[41:42] I remember coming to God in prayer and
[41:44] making my confession at the golden altar
[41:46] and saying I believe your word I believe
[41:48] now make it manifest in my life
[41:51] and all of those things come together
[41:52] you've got to remember all of those
[41:54] different milestones because if you just
[41:57] say well we're in the Holy of Holies now
[41:59] this is the age of the Holy of Holies
[42:01] this is the age of the Son of Man and
[42:03] you can't look back and remember where
[42:05] you come from
[42:06] it calls any question what your
[42:08] experience is it calls any question
[42:10] whether you really have what you saying
[42:12] yeah
[42:17] listen brother Brannon in the third seal
[42:19] he said now we find out then that these
[42:20] mysteries are supposed to be revealed
[42:23] that's what the prophet came to do to
[42:26] revealed and some of these mysteries
[42:28] involve justification sanctification the
[42:31] baptism holy ghost because he said just
[42:33] like take it on the other side there was
[42:35] people come in who
[42:36] had powers kings but wasn't keys you
[42:40] have to notice the Bible terminology of
[42:41] anything he said see now watch but the
[42:44] reason that all the stray ends of the
[42:46] mysterious part about justification the
[42:49] mysterious part of sanctification the
[42:52] mysterious part of the baptism of the
[42:54] Holy Ghost and why what kind that he Eve
[42:56] eat an apple or did she eat a
[42:58] pomegranate or something see what was
[43:00] the serpent see doth and he goes on to
[43:02] explain all the different mysteries but
[43:04] see there's a mystery of justification
[43:06] there's a mysterious part of
[43:08] sanctification there's a mysterious part
[43:10] of the baptism of Holy Ghost
[43:12] what is that mystery let's see what he
[43:14] said in the power of transformation he
[43:17] said that's what we all want to do is be
[43:19] not conformed to this world but be
[43:21] transformed by the renewing of our mind
[43:23] to do the perfect and acceptable will of
[43:26] God now that we have been saved as we
[43:30] are and that we have been filled with
[43:31] the Holy Spirit
[43:32] as we have now we want the mind that was
[43:37] in Christ to be in us that we might be
[43:40] transformed that from the natural things
[43:42] of life and be brought in to do the
[43:44] perfect will of God by transformation of
[43:47] God's Spirit by His Word in other words
[43:50] once you have gone through justification
[43:53] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[43:55] that's not the end of the story there's
[43:57] more to unfold there's more to be
[44:00] revealed there's more and listened to
[44:02] many times you know I'm gonna speak to
[44:04] the young people now the young people
[44:06] could come to church and it seems so
[44:08] much serious and everything maybe if you
[44:09] even if you're a new believer well and
[44:12] you begin to feel within yourself that
[44:13] you're being left behind and you may
[44:16] begin
[44:16] within yourself beginning to grow I
[44:17] don't understand these things maybe
[44:19] somebody that just recently started
[44:21] coming to church and you begin to it
[44:23] seems I feel like everything is so deep
[44:26] for me I wonder if I I can't hardly
[44:29] grasp but I'm wonder if I'm being left
[44:31] behind listen God is remembering God
[44:34] when it was Melchizedek visited Abraham
[44:36] he lingered he didn't just come and
[44:38] leave
[44:39] lingered around and the Son of man has
[44:41] labored around the Son of Man is
[44:43] manifesting himself now he's lingering
[44:45] he's been staying with us all this time
[44:48] waiting on you to catch the revelation
[44:50] of the word he's here to make sure that
[44:52] you catch the word and listen I've kind
[44:55] of got bad news for some of the old
[44:56] people because you know we preach about
[44:58] how we're going to take a rapture but
[44:59] the rapture cannot come if one of these
[45:02] predestinated children of God has yet to
[45:04] receive the new birth and one of these
[45:06] children of God has yet to grow up that
[45:08] sketch of a perfect man their answer
[45:10] cannot take place until that happens so
[45:13] that's why we've got to preach with all
[45:14] our might we've got to encourage that
[45:16] all I might we've got a love with all
[45:18] our mics so that everyone there that
[45:20] last one comes in and grows up the
[45:21] statue of a perfect man you know many
[45:25] times I wonder sometimes if maybe the
[45:27] old ones maybe get a little bit fearful
[45:29] than themselves and almost neglect the
[45:31] young people because you know you can
[45:33] get within your mind you begin to think
[45:34] well you know what let the young people
[45:36] just spin for themselves we're facing to
[45:38] take a rapture we're fixing to get out
[45:39] of here listen listen that's not how the
[45:42] rapture works you know just before
[45:45] brother Graham preached the seals he
[45:47] preached about Christ revealed and
[45:49] simplicity and how God he and all made
[45:51] comprehensible God came down from glory
[45:53] to be revealed to make himself simple
[45:56] and God is able to come down the early
[45:59] disciples were not men of great
[46:01] intellectual renown but they were just
[46:03] ignorant unlearned people and you don't
[46:05] have to be a great big intellectual mind
[46:08] to understand the message the message
[46:09] can be made simple enough for a little
[46:11] child to understand it so simple that
[46:13] you can preach the message by talking
[46:15] about a grain of wheat planting in the
[46:17] ground and it grows up until that grass
[46:19] same grain of weed he's made manifest at
[46:21] the end of that testimony a bird in that
[46:23] show that's how simple the message is
[46:27] listen I would encourage you don't don't
[46:29] give up don't give up but hang it hang
[46:32] in there the Bible says back in Isaiah
[46:34] said he that believeth shall not and
[46:36] make haste and I'll add slow and steady
[46:39] wins the race
[46:39] he that believeth shall not make haste
[46:42] hang in there and just stay with the
[46:44] message because God has not forgotten
[46:45] you I already read that quote let's keep
[46:52] it let's keep going on
[46:53] now we've come through the brazen
[46:55] officer and come through the labor and
[46:56] we're coming into the holy place where
[46:58] there's a lot of a lot of very
[47:00] interesting activity going on this is
[47:03] the this is really the prime place where
[47:05] the believers the day to day to day
[47:08] life's activities are there's a lot
[47:10] going in here in the holy place because
[47:12] you've come from sanctification into the
[47:14] holy place where you're from
[47:18] justification into the holy place where
[47:20] you enter into a religious atmosphere
[47:22] you're coming into a place of worship
[47:24] you're coming into where you know the
[47:27] approach to God and you understand how
[47:29] to get to God and you're beginning to
[47:30] let the Bible says work out your
[47:32] salvation with fear and trembling work
[47:34] it out and you go over to the table of
[47:36] showbread there on the right and you
[47:38] would get to pour through the Scriptures
[47:39] like I did I remember when I went to the
[47:42] table of showbread I remember when
[47:44] I when I began to feel that pull of God
[47:46] on my life and I went into the message
[47:48] and I began to search over the scripture
[47:50] the thing because I wanted to know what
[47:51] brother Owen said about the new birth
[47:53] and he would say that you must have a
[47:55] revelation that many people think they
[47:57] have a revelation but you've got to
[47:59] you've got to you got to take that
[48:01] journey until God gives you a revelation
[48:05] of himself you've got to keep moving on
[48:07] until it's until you know you read you
[48:11] read you want to read at that table of
[48:12] shewbread until you have an
[48:14] understanding of what you're getting
[48:15] into and see you've got you've got three
[48:18] things in that holy place three things
[48:20] of the battleground of the believer in
[48:22] that sanctified realm where you're
[48:23] battling it out with the mind listen
[48:26] within that holy places where all the
[48:29] believers got all these all these ideas
[48:31] and things you come to church and you
[48:33] think somebody your memory reason
[48:35] consciousness is affecting you can begin
[48:36] to think that people hate you or people
[48:38] upset with you people are trying to
[48:40] subvert your authority true people
[48:41] people are trying to take your position
[48:43] in the church but listen it's in that
[48:45] holy place where you do battle with all
[48:47] that nonsense when you I believe
[48:49] sometimes when we get upset with one
[48:51] another we our problem is we haven't
[48:53] spent enough time at the golden altar in
[48:55] prayer getting rid of all the ideas that
[48:58] it wouldn't listen with you when you
[49:00] come to a sanctified place and that that
[49:02] holy veil shuts down around you
[49:05] all the things that people say about you
[49:07] will just fall away and it matters
[49:10] nothing it doesn't matter what things
[49:12] that you remember we're all the things
[49:14] that people have said about you and all
[49:15] those different things so you got the
[49:23] table of showbread eating the word it
[49:25] had to be replenished every seven days
[49:27] but it could only be eaten by the priest
[49:29] that the the Avenue by which the
[49:32] believer is sanctified by the word by
[49:34] eating the word and studying the word
[49:35] and then over on the Left you've got the
[49:37] the lampstands brother haven't said now
[49:40] the light of the court was the firmament
[49:42] the light of the first veil was a bunch
[49:44] of lamps they got smoky and went out
[49:47] sometime and that's the way with a man
[49:49] from one revival to another if he's just
[49:51] living in the church and having a little
[49:53] spurt up once in a while and he gets all
[49:55] fired up with the revival but a few
[49:57] weeks that they don't start another one
[49:58] somewhere he goes down smokesouth see oh
[50:01] my church ain't having this one in my
[50:03] church and you know the reason brother
[50:05] Branham explained that the lamp gets
[50:07] smoky is because it's got a old down in
[50:08] the bottom and and the wick is your
[50:11] faith and God puts it all together and
[50:14] makes a fire up there it's his fire
[50:15] burning it's the it's the genuine
[50:17] anointing of the Holy Ghost on your
[50:18] spirit burn in that file give it a fire
[50:21] giving you a testimony that you're
[50:23] you're believing you're moving on with
[50:24] God but the reason it begins to get
[50:27] smoking is everything is because you get
[50:29] a little let a little water get in there
[50:31] you little little unbelief and get in
[50:33] there and it gets smoky and you have to
[50:36] tend to it you have to you constantly
[50:38] having to tend to that lampstand but
[50:42] when you get into the Holy of Holies
[50:43] there's nothing to 10s it's the faith of
[50:47] God in that Holy of Holies listen you
[50:51] see we'll get back on the youth meetings
[50:54] again you can go to a camp or whatever
[50:56] you can get in there in the anointing
[50:58] where the Spirit of God has fallen on
[50:59] your spirit and you're coming into a
[51:01] place where you just feel you just
[51:03] feeling raptured you just feel amazing
[51:05] God is actually working in your life or
[51:08] or maybe use it using another example
[51:10] because I know some of the young people
[51:11] have testified that well I got down at
[51:13] that golden altar we'll say like this I
[51:15] got down to that golden altar and I
[51:16] began to pray and
[51:18] I know I felt like God Himself was
[51:20] standing in front of me you could you
[51:21] could do like what a brother brother
[51:23] Dale has told us before of people in his
[51:25] family or whatever they had prayed until
[51:27] they actually felt the feet of the of
[51:29] Jesus before them you can get into that
[51:31] such an anointing like that but yet
[51:33] you're still not in the Holy of Holies
[51:35] yet you still you see you can have
[51:38] supernatural things happen in that outer
[51:40] court and supernatural things
[51:42] supernatural events God can even speak
[51:44] to you in that holy place God can speak
[51:47] to you in prayer but yet you have still
[51:48] not entered into that holy up holy of
[51:50] Holy's what you're searching for I'll
[51:53] say like the dinner at the youth camp if
[51:55] I'm about Danny Stephen and Dwayne
[51:57] Lawson and all the different ones that
[51:58] they've got they would get up and begin
[52:00] to preach to the young people and they'd
[52:01] say what you're looking for is a
[52:02] revelation well every single one of them
[52:04] would get up and say what you're looking
[52:06] for is a revelation and one after the
[52:08] other now I believe that's if we could
[52:10] get really instill in them in all of us
[52:13] that what you're searching for is a
[52:14] revelation and maybe not something will
[52:18] make it so big like we're looking for
[52:20] like a great big unfolding of the seven
[52:22] seals to reveal that you're born again
[52:23] of the Daniel 7 two weeks are all these
[52:25] things but maybe maybe what we should be
[52:27] looking for is something as simple as
[52:29] the Lord is there which is the last the
[52:33] last verse in Ezekiel when the Zika was
[52:35] looking at that new city he said jehova
[52:38] shamma the Lord is there the Lord is
[52:41] there when God reveals himself to you
[52:42] that the Lord is there taking a bi abode
[52:45] and you and down and the innermost part
[52:47] of your being the Lord is there and so
[52:51] then you've got the the table of
[52:52] showbread the lampstands that have to be
[52:54] continually 10:00 to 2:00 in that holy
[52:56] place and then you've got the golden
[52:58] altar and the golden offer just like the
[53:01] left stand the golden altar was lit off
[53:03] of that fire from the brazen altar
[53:05] because you can't come to that goal and
[53:07] offer altar and all for the incense of
[53:09] Prayer on that unless it's based upon
[53:12] the sacrifice that was all for altar on
[53:14] that brazen altar out in the out of
[53:15] court everything your entire approach to
[53:18] God depends upon your face your faith
[53:21] that God has the sacrifice has been paid
[53:24] for you and when you come to that altar
[53:26] you're making your confession to God
[53:27] you're looking
[53:28] a man making a confession with your
[53:30] faith believing that what you have read
[53:32] in the table of showbread what you heard
[53:34] from God's Word that you believe it and
[53:36] you're coming within a golden altar with
[53:38] the fire of that little bit of your
[53:40] revelation burning and you're coming
[53:42] with your confession and moving forward
[53:44] because it's your faith until you move
[53:47] into the Holy of Holies and God
[53:49] recognizes that your faith has been
[53:52] accepted and then he gives you his faith
[53:55] and that's the difference that's the
[53:57] difference between the outer court and
[53:58] their holy of holy the Holy Place and
[54:00] the Holy of Holies I know I'm going a
[54:05] little bit fast hey you know what I
[54:07] almost say it's a little bit it's fine
[54:09] if you want to close your eyes or
[54:10] whatever just go back and listen to it I
[54:12] know some of you will go back and pore
[54:13] over it again so that's fine if you I
[54:17] just want to I just want to take a
[54:19] little bit of time and just lay it out
[54:21] there so if you want to go back and pull
[54:22] over and review it again that's fine so
[54:26] [Music]
[54:27] listen that that altar of incense on
[54:30] that altar on that golden offer is
[54:32] offered your incense of your confession
[54:34] the way that they would mix up that
[54:36] incense was was slowly taking their time
[54:39] just like how you offer your I think so
[54:43] many times we fail to take time with God
[54:45] to offer up that incense of our
[54:48] confession to him of our Thanksgiving in
[54:50] our praise and I are believing to him
[54:52] like David pray do unto me according to
[54:55] all that you have promised that's our
[54:57] that's the correct approach to God you
[55:00] will give no we're begging and pleading
[55:02] with God like you know many times my
[55:04] children come to me begging and pleading
[55:05] and saying please can I have an iPod
[55:08] please get a Apple iPhone please can I
[55:10] have this and that get them anywhere but
[55:13] if you can come based upon God's Word
[55:15] and said do unto me according to all of
[55:18] our promises and listen that golden
[55:21] altar is where you take all of your
[55:24] burdens that lay it upon him and I think
[55:27] that's a problem that problem that that
[55:29] we have with our broken up families and
[55:31] our children running around everywhere
[55:33] it's because we haven't we've tried to
[55:35] mend it up we've tried to do with
[55:37] ourselves but if you come to that golden
[55:40] altar and
[55:41] it all on God because he said cast all
[55:44] of your cares upon me take my yoke my
[55:46] yoke is easy my burden is light and
[55:49] that's what he wanted us to do
[55:50] it's take all of our cares all of your
[55:52] problems at work all of the things where
[55:55] people are ridiculing you all all the
[55:57] church problems everything maybe you
[55:59] want a little bit closer experience with
[56:01] God take it before that golden altar and
[56:03] lay it upon him and see God work a
[56:07] wonder listen sometimes I think so many
[56:10] times we fight our battles the wrong way
[56:12] in the Old Testament they fought with a
[56:14] sword slinging it against the
[56:16] Philistines they thought with a sword
[56:18] and with a with a sling and all of those
[56:20] things but our battles in the New
[56:22] Testament are fought on our knees
[56:23] because brother Branham said that a real
[56:26] man is a man with baggy knees why
[56:29] because he's come to God and faith
[56:31] confessing that God is who confessing
[56:34] the promises that God has given to us
[56:37] Psalm 141 verse 2 says let my prayer be
[56:41] set before thee as incense and the
[56:43] lifting up of my hands as the evening
[56:45] sacrifice and the book of Revelation
[56:49] also speaks about that your prayer being
[56:51] as incense but look it's not maybe not
[56:54] even so much prayer if you want to look
[56:55] at it that way but coming before God
[56:58] with confidence asking based upon his
[57:01] word believing that he is who he says he
[57:03] is and you are who he says he is and you
[57:09] come believing so this is how you get
[57:12] the new earth as you come believe in
[57:14] confessing confessing I believe it I
[57:16] believe it and you keep saying it I
[57:18] believe it I believe I believe who the
[57:20] Bible says I am I believe it the Bible
[57:22] says that he that hunger is thirst for
[57:24] righteousness shall be filled the Bible
[57:26] says that God is able to raise up these
[57:28] stones and the children of Abraham and
[57:30] you keep confessing confessing I believe
[57:32] I believe that the promises to me I
[57:34] believe that the promises to my children
[57:36] never ever have a negative confession as
[57:39] soon as you begin confessing negatively
[57:42] then that they their faith just crumbles
[57:43] you can receive your healing and begin
[57:46] negative confession and it just
[57:47] undermines the whole thing never have a
[57:50] negative confession always have a
[57:52] positive confession and if you say what
[57:54] the word says you'll always be having a
[57:56] positive confession and you speak
[57:58] positively positively believing
[58:01] believing and then God will come on the
[58:03] scene and recognize your faith and give
[58:05] you his face and that's Galatians
[58:08] chapter two the whole chapter -
[58:09] Galatians 2:20 this life that I now live
[58:11] I live by the faith of the Son of God
[58:13] the we're not justified by our works but
[58:16] we're justified by the faith of the Son
[58:17] of God that we're justified we're
[58:19] justified by his faith and that's what
[58:22] faith is on the bottom because of this
[58:24] statute of a perfect man but it's not
[58:26] our faith it's his faith when you enter
[58:30] into that Holy of Holies
[58:32] that's the difference between the Old
[58:34] Testament in the New Testament and the
[58:36] Old Testament they had a little faith
[58:38] for the time but in the New Testament
[58:39] you've got access to God's faith a God's
[58:42] faith will make a mountain move God's
[58:44] faith will fight your battles for you
[58:46] but around said if you ever see one of
[58:48] God God fight battles it's an amazing
[58:51] thing to behold when God comes on the
[58:53] scene and fights your battles and that's
[58:54] why if you can get your head stuck into
[58:56] that Holy of Holies and the veil drops
[58:58] behind you you'll be like somebody you
[59:00] don't care what the world thinks that
[59:02] says outside you won't care how many
[59:04] people tell you you can't be healed
[59:06] you can't tell you don't care how many
[59:08] people say your housing situation can't
[59:10] be fixed or that you'll never be able to
[59:12] be saved that you send away your day of
[59:14] grace you don't care about these things
[59:16] because your head is stuck in the Holy
[59:18] of Holies and the world is sealed out
[59:20] when the world is still out you've got a
[59:22] new nature you've got that dumb nature
[59:25] listen I believe that's one of the
[59:26] evidences of the of the new birth is
[59:30] when that that nature of the Dove comes
[59:32] and rest upon your so rest within your
[59:34] soul you cannot eat the things of the
[59:37] world without gagging you can't go back
[59:40] to that vomit that cesspool and eat it
[59:42] without gagging listen you say that's I
[59:45] think that's one of the things that
[59:46] people miss today they think I can I've
[59:48] got the new birth I can I can roll
[59:51] around in the vomit and the quagmire and
[59:53] the mud and filth in the world and still
[59:55] say I got the new birth that they say
[59:57] the new birth
[59:58] is not powerful enough the holy ghost is
[1:00:00] not powerful enough to deliver me from
[1:00:02] the things of the world when you get the
[1:00:04] nuber the face of God down on the inside
[1:00:06] of your soul it'll get I it'll make you
[1:00:09] gag it all that stuff you can't eat it
[1:00:11] just like that just like the Dove that
[1:00:13] went out of the Ark and and came back it
[1:00:15] could not rest upon all that nationís
[1:00:17] that the crow could rest upon there's a
[1:00:20] new nature in there and that that nature
[1:00:23] of that Dove is hungry after the word
[1:00:25] it's because that's all I could eat
[1:00:28] that's all I could feed on is that word
[1:00:30] and they said hey it's hungry and
[1:00:32] searching for searching for that hidden
[1:00:36] manna that now you've got access to in
[1:00:38] that holy of holies because down in that
[1:00:40] in that Ark of the Covenant was that the
[1:00:42] three things that represented the life
[1:00:44] of the believer the Aaron's rod that
[1:00:45] budded that shows that that when you've
[1:00:48] got the new birth the life of Christ
[1:00:50] will make something that's dead live
[1:00:52] you've got access to the hidden manna
[1:00:54] and you've got the incorruptible man of
[1:00:57] the incorruptible word that will never
[1:00:59] rot as long as it was in that holy of
[1:01:02] Holy's it would never rot you've got
[1:01:04] access to an unending supply of that
[1:01:07] incorruptible man of the incorruptible
[1:01:09] Word and and you can look at that the
[1:01:12] two tables of stone and look at that and
[1:01:15] say I see myself written in here because
[1:01:18] this is a revelation of Jesus Christ and
[1:01:21] I'm part of that revelation and I know
[1:01:23] I'm part of his word you've got access
[1:01:25] to that kind of faith and now your life
[1:01:28] is preaching a sermon now your life is
[1:01:31] preaching the greatest sermon that could
[1:01:33] ever be preached a life lived by the
[1:01:35] word hungry and for the word living for
[1:01:37] the word a concern for lost souls
[1:01:40] somebody that's in service to God
[1:01:43] brother Branham said but when he wants
[1:01:45] what and in the supernatural he said
[1:01:47] when he once walked in behind that holy
[1:01:49] of holies walked into the presence of
[1:01:51] God and the veil falls behind him
[1:01:53] there's a pot of manna there he can eat
[1:01:55] every day every hour of the week there
[1:01:58] is where he's living in this kind of
[1:02:00] glory were in the interlock wings of the
[1:02:03] cherubim the great pillar of fire and
[1:02:04] the Shekinah rested there and he's
[1:02:06] living under there he can't be nothing
[1:02:08] but a real genuine Christian
[1:02:10] Loree atmosphere but what is it what is
[1:02:19] the new birth faith is a revelation
[1:02:23] brother Adam said the new birth is a
[1:02:26] personal the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:02:29] personal into you a personal revelation
[1:02:32] right how is it a personal revelation
[1:02:34] I'm going to share some of these quotes
[1:02:36] with you because I've been asked over
[1:02:38] and over I keep saying the new birth is
[1:02:41] when God puts his faith inside of you
[1:02:44] show me where brother Branham said then
[1:02:46] all right I'll show you where the Bible
[1:02:48] and brother Graham said there in
[1:02:50] Galatians chapter 2 verse 16 the Bible
[1:02:54] says knowing that a man is not justified
[1:02:57] by the works of the law but by the faith
[1:02:59] of Jesus Christ even we have believed in
[1:03:02] Jesus Christ that we might be justified
[1:03:04] by the faith of Christ by the faith of
[1:03:08] court not by our faith you're justified
[1:03:11] by his faith and this justification is
[1:03:15] not talking about a baby form
[1:03:16] justification this justification is
[1:03:19] talking about when you are born again
[1:03:20] your soul is just it is just as just as
[1:03:25] God is just because that's God and you
[1:03:28] are justified by his faith by the face
[1:03:31] of Christ and not by the works of the
[1:03:33] law for by the works of the law shall no
[1:03:35] flesh be justified in Galatians 2:20 it
[1:03:38] says I am crucified with Christ
[1:03:39] nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ
[1:03:41] liveth in me and the life which I now
[1:03:44] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[1:03:46] the Son of God who loved me and gave
[1:03:48] himself for me let's read let's read
[1:03:53] some things brother I'm said and while
[1:03:54] we are not a denomination in 1958 I will
[1:04:01] kind of skip down to the highlighted
[1:04:02] part and then when you let your faith
[1:04:04] faith run out - it's in - you begin to
[1:04:08] believe then let your subconscious go to
[1:04:12] acting then the faith of God will back
[1:04:16] it up then you'll go right on out see
[1:04:19] because your faith won't do too much
[1:04:22] your subconscious
[1:04:24] to move in the direction that your faith
[1:04:25] is moving and then God's faith moves in
[1:04:28] behind and confirms it all see but if
[1:04:32] it's your faith oh yes I got it right
[1:04:35] now that's that's you in that holy place
[1:04:37] your stumble I believe for my healing
[1:04:40] and you confessing I'm healed I'm healed
[1:04:43] I'm healed God's Word says I'm healed
[1:04:45] I'm healed I'm here but don't give up
[1:04:48] you wait for his faith to come and
[1:04:51] accept that you are believing and then
[1:04:53] he'll back it up and you say I wonder if
[1:04:57] it'll work on me yeah it won't do it
[1:05:00] right then so we want this to be a real
[1:05:03] healing service see your faith won't do
[1:05:06] too much but your faith is is for
[1:05:09] confessing and believing until he comes
[1:05:11] and backs it up
[1:05:13] let's see be not afraid of his iron 1961
[1:05:17] he said
[1:05:21] see that's the poison breasts of Satan
[1:05:26] don't have nothing to do with him he
[1:05:29] don't believe like we do there's only
[1:05:31] one faith that's the faith of God right
[1:05:35] that's right God's faith your human
[1:05:40] faith don't go very far but God's faith
[1:05:44] in you makes you love everybody makes me
[1:05:48] love everybody that's right that's what
[1:05:49] God's faith does do you makes you have
[1:05:51] the same feeling that Jesus did because
[1:05:54] the Spirit of Christ is he let's reading
[1:05:58] the faith that was once delivered to the
[1:05:59] Saints
[1:06:01] I'm sorry brothers if I'm making y'all
[1:06:03] hop around a little bit I'll remember
[1:06:04] exactly where that was in my should be
[1:06:07] around there somewhere but he said
[1:06:09] that's the reason we can't have a
[1:06:12] revival you've got to get back to God's
[1:06:15] faith again in the Bible where men and
[1:06:18] women become born-again and regenerated
[1:06:22] by the Holy Ghost and good and into the
[1:06:26] door to the heart in 1960 brother Graham
[1:06:29] said now he said well he can't do much
[1:06:32] for you if you've got your own faith I
[1:06:34] don't want no faith
[1:06:36] I want his faith my faith is no good the
[1:06:43] face of God is what we need God's faith
[1:06:46] in us
[1:06:48] my faith is no good your faith is no
[1:06:52] good
[1:06:52] it takes Christ to come in and stand in
[1:06:55] that door of faith and be Lord Lord of
[1:06:58] your faith when you read in the Bible
[1:07:01] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:07:02] and forever your faith will say that's
[1:07:05] impossible but his faith will say Amen I
[1:07:09] am and that's where that's the whole
[1:07:17] journey of a believer and I'm gonna I'm
[1:07:19] gonna wrap up right there I don't want
[1:07:22] to where everybody out but so the
[1:07:24] musicians can come ahead and gun for see
[1:07:26] the whole journey of a believer you can
[1:07:28] see you can see the identification of
[1:07:30] where you are by looking at the journey
[1:07:32] of a believer through those course from
[1:07:35] the outer court to the Holy Place into
[1:07:38] the Holy of Holies and look back I
[1:07:40] wonder tonight if you could look back
[1:07:41] and remember all of the different times
[1:07:43] that you've studied in the world that
[1:07:44] you've prayed all night to get the you
[1:07:47] know going to youth meetings going to
[1:07:48] camps and different things to kind of
[1:07:50] rekindle that lamp stand to get the fire
[1:07:52] blazing up again to get all of that
[1:07:54] unbelief purged out of that holy place
[1:07:56] and then remember when you step through
[1:07:58] into the Holy of Holies and God came
[1:08:01] down and just just you entered into that
[1:08:04] rest where you know that you know
[1:08:06] nothing can ever take you away from this
[1:08:08] message when you when when his faith
[1:08:10] comes in and rest like that nothing can
[1:08:12] ever take your wave nothing could ever
[1:08:14] separate you from the love of God when
[1:08:16] he comes in to abide with you and then
[1:08:18] see then you you are able to preach the
[1:08:22] greatest sermon that could ever be
[1:08:24] preached you're able to share the life
[1:08:26] of Christ to the people that you come in
[1:08:28] contact with it work you're able to
[1:08:30] share the life of Christ to people at
[1:08:32] church and that is the kind of sermon
[1:08:34] that will convict the sinners and save
[1:08:37] the Lost
[1:08:37] amen let's stand to our feet I just want
[1:08:41] to I just want to pray everybody before
[1:08:45] we kind of close our
[1:08:49] let's just bow our heads for a moment I
[1:08:52] wonder tonight if you know you you hear
[1:08:57] about whether the real new birth E is
[1:09:00] and what that God is able to put his own
[1:09:02] faith inside of you and able to take the
[1:09:05] world completely out of you we read all
[1:09:07] of those quotes about how how even after
[1:09:10] you got the new birth what your your
[1:09:13] objective should be is to get as close
[1:09:15] to God as possible so that you can you
[1:09:18] can use you to a place to where that the
[1:09:21] life of Christ is made manifest in you
[1:09:23] just like it was in Jesus where people
[1:09:26] would come in near I wonder if tonight
[1:09:29] maybe if you all a life like that if you
[1:09:31] just lift up your hands to God and say
[1:09:33] if you could just use me in a way that
[1:09:36] that people would be convicted when they
[1:09:38] come into my presence when when people
[1:09:40] would would get around me and hear my
[1:09:42] conversation that would say there it
[1:09:43] goes a real child of God they're real it
[1:09:46] goes a real son or daughter of God if
[1:09:48] you just lift your hands up to him Lord
[1:09:51] Jesus you see ever hand lift it up to
[1:09:53] You Lord Jesus and Lord you your prophet
[1:09:56] taught us Lord Jesus that that with our
[1:09:58] old stubborn hearts with our hearts of
[1:10:00] stone we couldn't even move one hand up
[1:10:02] to you unless you come and spoke to us
[1:10:05] and moved us Lord Jesus to lift our
[1:10:07] hands up to you desiring something from
[1:10:09] you Lord Jesus and I pray O God that
[1:10:11] you'll look down and every upper lifted
[1:10:13] hand the night Lord Jesus and see the
[1:10:14] desires of our heart Lord Jesus Lord God
[1:10:17] you've given us a way back to You Lord
[1:10:19] God you've given us you were Lord Jesus
[1:10:21] and now we just asked Lord God that
[1:10:23] you'll help us to yield ourselves to you
[1:10:25] Lord more fully Lord that when we that
[1:10:28] when we leave this place tonight Lord
[1:10:30] Jesus will be more changed Lord Jesus
[1:10:32] that something will have taken place
[1:10:34] within us Lord God of desire maybe to be
[1:10:37] more concerned about the loss be more
[1:10:39] concerned about our families be more
[1:10:41] concerned about our church be more
[1:10:43] concerned about the other believers in
[1:10:45] the message Lord Jesus the Oh Lord will
[1:10:47] maybe be able to pray a little bit
[1:10:49] differently now we'll be able to read
[1:10:51] the word a little bit differently Lord
[1:10:53] Jesus and it will go forth from this
[1:10:55] from this place you change people Lord
[1:10:57] Jesus Lord God look upon our desire Lord
[1:11:00] God with
[1:11:00] i uplifted hand Lord Jesus and I pray
[1:11:02] Lord that little Lord be seen as you as
[1:11:05] a sweet incense going up before your
[1:11:07] altar in heaven Lord God we pray we
[1:11:09] asked Lord Jesus your blessings upon
[1:11:11] this church Lord Jesus since you'll just
[1:11:12] bless the remainder of this service
[1:11:14] bless the pastor Lord God and all the
[1:11:16] ones Lord Jesus that might be needed
