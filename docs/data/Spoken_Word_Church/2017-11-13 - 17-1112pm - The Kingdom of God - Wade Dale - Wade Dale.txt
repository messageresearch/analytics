our brothers and sisters I've like precious faith I want to thank you for the ones that were here yesterday for your support in the memorial service we had for June's mom we have a full house yes and I think y'all for coming but we had a full house we had 80 or so people here and we weren't expecting that meaning some but thank you the ones that the church here that came and gave your support and fixed food and put icing cups and all that other stuff so we sure to appreciate it but good to be good to have that done and and go on and just pray for the family and remember to brother boys class sister Monica's class and his class and Rachel's class stay in sanctuary after the service to practice the Christmas play / song everybody got that okay one more time Boyd's class is to moderate this class and his class in Rachel's class so that means every class except my class are the ones that's going to do and I'm gonna give you a little heads up we're going to since we're starting in next Sunday we'll be starting in the first seal trying to get this revelation five kind of sewn up so we can have a good foundation but brother Aaron's gonna take them up to December and he's going to teach our Sunday School class and then the month of January brother Bob would be doing it been letting them doing a couple of weeks at a time and I it's not that I'm letting them do it I think the Lord is is leading to do that and let brother Bob have the whole month of January so they can continue a thought it's really hard even when you're you know all of us that preach know that one service unless you're just a pure evangelist one service just can't do justice to to a teaching ministry you know it makes you really nervous and and makes you preach long so that I told brother Tim and him up there last weekend we had a real good time I want to thank everybody that that went supported that that that is just we spoke for an hour and 45 minutes but it really didn't seem like it and it really didn't seem like it to them either they really didn't care they weren't sleepy or running out the door they were running down the aisles but not running out the door so but we want to we want to give we want to give the full fivefold ministry a full length of time to two to do their to do their work so brother Aaron's going to do December brother Bob January Luise February brother Ryan March and probably brother Joe and he says he may not be here so I don't know what brother Joe was talking about but he you know we won't let him go home right yet but remember - brother Joe will be here wins then but dad and I are leaving right after this service we're gonna go hunting for about three days together down to South Georgia so just keep us in your prayers if the Lord blesses keep us safe and give us game for his honor and glory amen so now let's turn our Bibles to the revelations chapter five we're gonna speak a little bit today on the kingdom of God because I that covers a lot of space and a lot of territory but we're gonna try to bring it in and bring it all together from revelations 5 we've been into the throne we've been into the book we've looked at all these other characters but let's look at this we're gonna look at these seven horns and seven eyes because I believe that'll tie that in and it'll get your mindset to when we head toward the seals that we'll look at full Redemption because the seven horns and seven ize has to because seven is what seven is the number of completion something is completed when there's seven horns and seven eyes there so let's let's look the revelation is five verse one let's bow our hands Heavenly Father we pray Lord that you be with us said let's take care of us today Lord you be the one that does the speaking of them a revealing father or B you be the active participant in the service that we will give you all the praise and honor and glory for everything you've done so much in all of our lives we can stand here today and think of many things that you've done for us Lord we appreciate all those things what a great time of things given that we have coming up in the world but Lord what a great thing is given we should have in our heart every day of all the things that you've done for us father just forgive us of our sins Lord take care of each one that's not here bless the ones on the highways Lord just bless the missionaries give them proof of their labors Lord as they go even to this field here in the United States but also in the foreign field just bless the fivefold ministry Lawrence wherever they may be today that you'll touch them Lord and anoint them and sanctify them for the journey probably just be with us now and take care of us and the rest of this service in Jesus name we pray amen and I saw on the right hand of him and said on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof we were talking about who is worthy we found all that out so you should be able to keep that turn that around in your mind a little bit and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and I'll be held in low in the midst of the throne this we're gonna take our tax phones verse six and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders to the lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth you may be seated in the Lord I just blessing to the reading of the word looking forward to brother Jewell coming being with us Wednesday and give us a give us a little helicopter message you know and I told him up here brother towns I was like a big c-5a that was full of cargo and full of full of soldiers it took the whole runway to take off and it took the whole runway to land so but we all have our way of doing things right I'm gonna try not to I still my voice is still cracking a little bit so you just keep her you just pray for me that that the Lord will have his way now we're gonna start with number one because I want a background just a minute of what we were talking about last week or two weeks ago how can I overcome the prophet of God 1963 1963 did you notice the arrangements of that sea set with me in my throne because that's the last thought we had not on my throne in my throne that's in his domain now that's what we're told today we're talked about the kingdom of God because the kingdom of God covers a lot but I think we can cover it today and show where the Lord has give us a little bit of an insight into I was reading some quotes in the back where brother Branham was talking about you can't jesus said you can't in other words you without the Holy Ghost can enter the kingdom of God absolutely but you can even understand it okay you can't understand the workings and the things in the kingdom of God cuz there's a kingdom and a kingdom has to what have a king has to have a queen and it has to have subjects and it has to have a place you can't have a kingdom out in air no a kingdom is a domain is what we're talking about here it's a domain over something that what has been established now this king established a domain before the foundation of the world amen and then coming into that domain to see Redemption is that we fell from the rice of that now listen we didn't fall from our inheritance as far as that inheritance of eternal life before the foundation of the world we fell from the inheritance of what eternal life in these bodies into the in the world we're coming right back to this world we're coming right back here and we're gonna have a body that is glorified that doesn't hurt that doesn't that doesn't make one mistake that's what we're heading towards because remember that's what Adam was before the fall you said it out of make mistakes well he listened he was so much God till God didn't question what he done even when God went looking for Adam he was looking for Adam and Adam was hiding God wasn't hiding God didn't say no I can't talk no he went looking for him Adam was the one that had a change of what mind his carnal mind had what no his mind had been changed to carnality amen because remember they didn't know good and evil amen now then he said what did God tell him said who told you this who told you this he and the words God said I didn't tell you this this wasn't part of the kingdom that I'm trying to set up right here but he knew ins in his self glisten God knew all this was gonna happen and like brother Dale said and I have always agreed the way God did this is the very way he's going to be revealed or he would have written it or placed it in a different way this is it this is a perfect gun with a perfect word and the only way we're gonna get it is the way he has already give it to us and then there's no secret coming it's been made known the books open okay it's an open book don't sit with me in my throne not on my throne in my throne that's in his domain pull that cloak back up please and now as Christ is the ruler thrown ruler at this time of the complete domain of God look so will the church be with him the bride be with him in his throne in the entire domain not on my throne but in my throne see where his domain reaches a throw owners over a domain and a domain reaches just as far as this boundaries does I like that and watch what he says and this is from eternity to eternity hey man so this is this is we are what a privileged group of people that's what we were trying to get you know to the people last weekend what a what a positive people we should be had a preacher walk up to me and he said you know I heard your dad preached one sermon on positive attitude he said that I have been impacted by that sermon and that's been Lord brother Carlos come here probably six or eight years ago and was coming through and listened to you when you were preaching on a positive attitude he said to tell you that something I forgot so I'll tell you I'll give you a and I'll give you one of them that brother Joe said that what is it are we supposed to be sad listen this kingdom domain is from eternity to eternity not from what I listen to our domain and our inheritance like we were talking about yesterday IRA our earthly inheritance had a beginning and it's definitely gonna happen again we're not gonna carry money with us till the Millennium we're not gonna carry a car a nice car we're not going to carry nice clothes and and sorry we're not gonna have nice jewelry that's for him amen it's not the girl with the biggest stone it's the girl bride with the biggest revelation and then comes the stone is revelation amen it's good to have all these things obviously I enjoy life but we can't put our hope back on that and say well I'm getting this inheritance our inheritance remember I told you was before the foundation of the world listen it can't be touched Satan's dirty hands never got on that inheritance if you're born again today he cannot touch your soul but boy he can play with your mind and he can play with your memory reason conscious affection imagination and listen your body is just along for the ride you don't reason with your body your reason with your mind that's why I Eve the first thing Eve was in her mind and then what her body just reacted to what her inside told her to do now not the inside of the inside no not the inside that Satan could not get to Eve soul but he got to her what senses of memory reason conscious affection imagination Eve you see the animals God told you what to do what a preacher listen you can't touch Satan when he's preaching he's anointed he can bring it but brother Bram said a he's got one problem he can't bring it word for word he can't bring it word for word and then what I was trying to tell him up there in in North Carolina we've got a message though that came perfect word-for-word amen and it's not just the written pages of the prophets message look the Pharisees walked up to Jesus and they said we live Moses his law as I said yesterday the the rich young ruler as far as what was written on the page Jesus couldn't touch his life but when Jesus told him to sell everything he had oh he got into the census on that sell everything you have and come and follow me that's when what he turned away and he was in hell remember the rich young really went to hell so the riches is not all the outside but it's on the inside where does his domain reach the throne is over a domain and the domain reaches just as far as this boundaries does now look now look he said now watch what he says a domain reaches just as far as his boundaries does period he's talking about this there's no boundaries from eternity to turn that's why I brought that intercept look there's no there's no boundary this way there's no boundary this way it's all in eternity I was reading a quote back here just a few minutes ago when you become born again you have to the probably God said you have to have a different way of thinking it takes you in a supernatural realm that your natural person never has entered into that's why it was the new birth and that's why when we look at these seals and we look at the what God's put on the on the pages it's got to be the essence of what that says it's not the written letter jesus walks up one day and says eat my flesh and greet my blood and walks off but the Holy Ghost comes back and explains it that you're not to be a cannibal but if you took that very quote he said he said you're looking at the Son of man standing alert but he's in heaven now hold on a minute the Son of Man is the flesh guard hello really I mean you know you can say the Son of God well he can be in heaven but he said the Son of Man which is in earth and he's in heaven that's a supernatural understanding that only a few people would understand I don't believe those people standing around him it probably just threw their mind into a tizzy but by supernatural revelation a glorified body can be anywhere a glorified body can be anywhere right cuz remember he's got a body Jesus Christ has got a body hey man not just the body you and I are his body but he has a literal body amen we brought that out the other day and it's not laying on the throne it yeah we'll get into it maybe in just a few minutes but that is that man was a mediator he can't listen you don't walk into a courtroom and this is not even my nose yeah I'm gonna charge you for this one you know you walk into courtroom in and the lawyers asleep the judges are sweet and the jury's asleep but what are you gonna get done nothing know that mediator if you've got a real good lawyer he's gonna work and work and work and you know what he's gonna do he's gonna work that whole courtroom he's gonna work the judge and he's gonna work the jury well that's what Christ is he's a mediator he did his mediatorial work right now and down to the church ages he was working he's not just sitting on a throne watching he's working but that body is what it is put there as that what sacrifice that we can look like and see that sacrifice know that he took our sins know that he took our our stripes and and and all the things I was thinking the other day you know you we think of cancer and all these things that are that are really bad but but when Jesus Christ died on the cross the Bible says he took all that with him that's why that once the kingdom come to William Branham and any of you that's in the kingdom of God cancer can't stand before that doesn't matter if it's a man if it's brother branham are you and I put the same Kingdom we had the same Kingdom now sure he isn't he had a prophetic office that he worked through but you and I thought we were all prophetic I thought you and I were a little messiahs I thought you and I were and I think a lot of times it that people taking just say well you know brother Graham took it all back with him and and we don't we don't have anything he brought it so we could use it not brought it so he can take it back he brought it so we can use it that's what revelations 5 is to me revelations 5 look at the movement if you read the whole thing revelations 5 you keep reading it somebody's moving somebody's crying somebody's weeping somebody shouting somebody's reaching to get a book somebody's what doing mediator work it's a movement God is moving the kingdom of God is not a sanitary Kingdom it's moving all the time and even when we get to the Millennium even when we get to the future home we're not gonna just sit around we can if we won't do but we're gonna be moving but we're not gonna have to I got to sit and rest even in the Millennium the Bible says they'll build houses right no not the future home but in the Millennium build houses and inhabit there's gonna be people working so why are we not working now we need to work now right now let's go back revelations file to listen from eternity there's something there's a domain there's a kingdom of God which we know you said what brother way that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost now buddy that covers a lot all right revelations 5 verse 6 and I'll be held in low in the midst of the throne just go to the next pass the next quote okay in the midst of the net of the throne and of the four beasts now watch and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth now listen you and I have a commission it's like I was telling you the other day you and I have an inheritance every church age had an inheritance he that overcome will I give he that overcometh I give and then our last one is it's two just what I was telling you that to me that last church they see it wraps up that whole domain because you got we're gonna look in a few minutes that in the first church at first two or three church ages you have the lion then you have the odds and you have the man then you have the eagle now brother Branham we know that we're in a prophetic age but the prophet of God said it was going to take all four combat beef to get us out of here and that is the Holy Ghost we're gonna need the lion we're gonna need the Ox a man an eagle him in that all right in this endtime that's why when the seals open it opened and brought eternity to earth it brought eternity to earth it brought a mindset that if we don't at this right we're gonna stay here and look we can't there's no other Church age there there's no other prophet to come there's no other overcoming except the one that we get when we overcome all things when we go to the future home you know that we have eight overcoming their seven in the church ages then there's one if you'll read in Revelations 22 he says he that overcometh will I give all things so that's it man all is all he gives you that whole Dominion he gives you everything you need that future home brothers and sisters that's all eight that's all in the eighth day that's all and that's why I've always said we got a piece of that now because if you're born again you're in that eighth day you're in that future home it's actually in you but what is it it's separated hello it's separated but when we all come together that cities gonna come down and we're gonna enter right into that city and it's not going to be a place where you know sometimes you walk into place and you go I like my mom I don't like that color I don't like that no it's gonna be made by what what what has built you what has built you the desire that you have that's what it's going to be built with why no hammers no nails right but it is you and I doing something here that's why revelations 5 we got to finish this up watch Revelations for now watch how many times it says missed now brother day let's cover this we'll cover it again miss miss alright now go to the revelations what's the next one revelation 4 and before the throne there was a sea of glass like in the crystal in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind the first beast was like a line the second beast like a calf or not the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle now we're gonna cover every one of those in the seals because this the Holy Ghost that opens the seal then it's got to be holy ghost that does the work and then it's the Holy Ghost that does the work but look how many times it says in the mist now watch let's look at what the Greek says Lexington says about missed all these are the same meaning look at him among from among or amongst so it's not that slight brother Dale said it's not that he's standing in the middle church agent he's more know he's in the mist he's he to me out to me I look at that in Revelations one I look at Christ standing with his arms like this and he's touching the first agent he's touching the last age he's touching the first church agent he's touching and he's in the mister are amongst are from among he's in you he's in every person down to the church ages just as much as he's in you but that word was what was it there was a part that was taken that was given to Martin Luther let's adjust shall live by faith he fulfill what went on then you come to Luther I'm into Wesley then you come to Pentecost and then what we do is we look back that's one way we can look back we have to look back and get that because that has to come to us because he's living amongst his people he's living from among so anytime you see that word mist it's not that it's not that he's standing in the very middle and that's the only put no he's he's as much in this age as he is in the other ages it's just in this first three ages that lying then you got the ox in the fourth church age you got the man in the fifth and six will cover in the seal then you got the eagle in the seventh church age which is what now oh that was for brother branham no come on people that wasn't just for brother Branham that was what he come to breed us he come to bring you to us he come to bring us something that we just it was been laying in the Bible we were brother Tim and I were talking about Sunday brother branham never brought us a new Bible but he said the Bible became a new book what to him the Bible should be a new book to all of us in other words we didn't have to turn this Bible around and rewrite it to fit the prophets message now the prophet of God's message fits the Bible amen and then what do you do he took the one of the things that we were doing wrong and had wrong in doctrine and he turned us the right way amen we covered that already but right here in Revelations 5 we see the kingdom of God you say what is the kingdom of God the kingdom of God now to remember the kingdom of God is within side of you but that's not all the kingdom that's your part but you get all this in that kingdom of God you got the spoonful you got the ocean you got the spoonful you got the same elements in other words it's gonna take all of this line ops man and eagle it's gonna take all the fullness to get us out of here that's what revelation shows it shows that what that's gonna take every bit of that because remember this is what strikes me in Revelations 5 from the time John cries that no one is worthy until what the lamb comes which he's got seven horns and seven eyes right when he takes that book and the prophet of God tells us he turns and opens the book and reveals the seals right well then truly then redemption is over I'll read it to you I'm not gonna read it exactly like that but he's done his mediatory work but he's not going to stop until every person's name that's in that book has been brought into the kingdom amen that's what revelations 5 shows and then he's made us kings and priests and put us back on the earth so there's been a body change in there somewhere there's been what there's been an adoption there's been an adoption there's been us come to the placing of adoption then that we have come to the fullness there's been a resurrection there's been a body change there's been a rapture and we've been sitting in heavenly places and the Jews are getting their message because remember the elders ever and even the Old Testament everybody ever that's why say revelations Fathers the whole kingdom of God that's my brother man said that's the most sublime scripture in the Bible if Christ had nur took that book listen if he hadn't took that book you go right back to Hebrews 11 they without us cannot be made perfect and I told you when he reached and grabbed that book that meant that book was worthy that book had to come to a position because that book is the kingdom of God let's read number two the breach now notice there are seven horns on this lamb did you notice it having seven horns we just been through that horns means power to the animal y'all got it back tame horns means power to the animal and notice he was not an animal because he took the book out of the right hand of him that said upon the throne see and notice oh my I believe I had that wrote down somewhere to break the seals in to loose the title deed and the message to the last angel he takes his kingly place in other words what after the message of the last church age messenger this is where he's taking his kingly place then all right amen that's what he comes forth now to do now is this we know that's the scene but it's going to happen right here in me and you now watch when he comes out now when he saw this lamb John looking at it look like it had been slain bloody and he's come from eternity and he cease to be a mediator listen when everybody's saved and everybody's locked up in that book he's not a mediator anymore he has become a judge and not just become a judge himself but he has subjects that are in judgment with him and he's come from eternity and he seeks to be a mediator then pray to Mary as much as you want to he had must have some Catholics there there was no man in heaven an earth person being nowhere else could take it John even wept about it Oh Catholic friends can't you see it don't pray to some dead people person the lamb is the only mediator he was the one that came forth and what did he do he's been back here interceding until has his blood has atone for what every person that's why revelations 5 completes the whole thing but remember you got to go back to revelation 6 to find out how 5 gets completed and then that's what we're going to get into us won't you see go back and read revelations 5 if you have a problem with the seals go back and look at this plan of redemption because the kingdom of God blank brings the plan of redemption into full view that's the fullness of God he's been back here interceding until his blood has atone for every person and the lamb now he knows what's written in the book so he knowed from the foundation of the world their names were in there so he has stood back here and done mediate mediator work like this until mediatorial work until everyone that's been put in the book has been redeemed and it's finished now he walks out so he's done his kinsmen work you know you know what the kinsmen work was watch this right here do you know what the kinsman work is to testify before elders what did Boaz Du Bois didn't what kick his shoe off in his house he had to go to a public place he had to take off his shoe and say I claim the rights to redeem my inheritance from the family whatever that family was a brother whatever would be had to be a kinsman the watch he's done his kinsmen work you know you know what the kinsmen work was to testify before elders you remember Boaz kicked off the shoe see after you and I to testify before man to testify before the world that God is still he's brought his kingdom to earth it's not a place we're going it's already been here it's been hidden in simplicity all the way down from the very day that Peter said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ all the way down to hear that alright you know what the kids when work was to testify before elders you remember boy I was kicking off his shoes and forth he's done all this now he comes to take his bride a man he comes now as king he's looking for his queen I wrote myself a note that's not looking for the bride anymore that's looking for his wife I told him up in North Carolina I married a bride but 38 years later I am married to my wife because she's come to a place and we've come to a place he's looking for its Queen in this book is the whole secret of it why do we have to look somewhere else the whole secret of it is wrapped up around seven seals what is the secret of the Queen because the Queen is the only thing but the earth is going to be redeemed because we redeem the earth is not coming to to any kind of a position until you and I come to a position come to a place where God can use us and then when he uses us we turn and we give it to the earth well that ought to make y'all sleeping in this book is the whole secret of it wrapped up around seven seals oh brother seven seals waiting for him to come now let's go to number three and reading the breech seven horns was the seven churches all right so there were seven horns and seven eyes remember horns means what powers all right horned means power all right what's the seven church age you see the seven church age is because that was the Lambs protection what he protected his right with on earth was a god-sent group of people that's protected see the Horn of the Lamb seven eyes are the seven messenger of the seven Church ages seven eyes or seven seers so God comes down through seven seers seven eyes and he brings the message to his church to his bride and then through the foolishness of preaching the Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists we're supposed to dress the bride and make a life out of her and then dr. I for verse nine the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it their brother Dale covered this the other day so you ought to remember and thou shalt know that the Lord of Hosts hath sent me unto you for who else despised the day of small things now when brother Branham reads this we'll see in a minute he says see their God in simplicity God in simplicity who has what despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth which is your seven church days met that's why I told you before that's why that those seven churches had to be lined up they had to have the correct messenger and to get the correct messenger the Prophet goes back and looks at the pattern right right because he was leaning toward poly car code he was looking at Polycarp and the holy ghost said no he leaned a little too much toward denomination so Iranian says my man okay so but so we had to have that so we can know who Iranians was and the message that Iranians brought and the message that Paul brought and the message that who at Martin Martin one of the greatest teachers is one garden brother Brian said in the world well they needed that because what that was that lion lion li o and that was that one end of that lion age heading toward the on stage where they took the name of Jesus Christ and made him a second person of a Trinity all right God knows what he's doing they man now let's read number four I'm gonna be long we just got a few more quotes I want I just want to cover this one last thing before we start into the seals and just pray for us next Sunday maybe you'll be a little more happy about that listen we're heading toward a change of a body you're either gonna die and we're gonna put you in the ground or you're going to listen to what's being said like it was the first time you ever heard it or you can sleep home now let's turn to Zechariah 14 the property God said listen so--that's despised the day of small things God in simplicity see see he just preached guarding simplicity he would the Lord was taking him back to that for they shall rejoice and see the plummet I missed my place 30 oh right here see the plumbing and Hannah's ruble with those with those seven these are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth don't tell me God took a vacation after the fall no he went right to work and I brother Nell said down to the old testament he couldn't enter into man but he sure could lead man he sure could give them salvation I was reading today did you read that when he put it up on the board he didn't say nothing about a prophet coming to Abraham it said abraham believed god abraham believed god each one of those believe god listen they didn't have a quote book they didn't even have a Bible oh sure they had the Torah but it wasn't given to everybody only the priests held it right how'd you like to be sitting in your living room one day just sitting there so much speaks and says get up Donnie faught blush and move take your family and go north Donnie's going weird the prophets say that is that in a song Abraham had nothing his home daddy was an idol maker he was sitting in the very throes of idolatry didn't know a thing about God he heard a voice that said get up and move and he just what got up and move but you know what God vindicated his move you got to be careful with that you can't somebody tell you get up move but God's gonna vindicate that move that's what's telling them in North Carolina you know there was a brother one time and most of you know who it is I'm gonna call his name but he was moved of God to take a job on Sunday so he could send all that he had everything he made on Sunday he would send to the missionary field and that was of God well it lasted a little wild and and he got worse spiritually than he ever was before that one God you told him that so you got to try those spirits to see if they're what see if they're in the word but remember Paul Abraham didn't have that didn't have a Bible to go back and check it by that's why you and I see Abraham could make those mistakes even David could make those mistakes but you and I can't make those mistakes you and I have everything we have an open book we have a library God sent a prophet we got 1100 sermons all these things that we got this knowledge what the Bible said knowledge would increase right but if it's not Holy Ghost knowledge it doesn't do you any good right how about a fisherman yeah God depended on the man that couldn't even read and write to bring the first message to save 3,000 people Peter couldn't even write his name but you know what he said silver and gold have I none but such as I have he knew he had something he knew he got something on that day of Pentecost and what it stayed with him all the way through but remember see his powerful this Peter is God didn't choose him to be the spokesman of the church church age Paul was the Paul was the messenger to the first church age why because Paul took the Old Testament ray man Paul took that he did have something to go by he took the Old Testament and Roe 80% of the New Testament looking back through the Old Testament coming through the blood of Christ and taught Jesus Christ perfect enough to where God said that's my Eternal Word I'm gonna put it in the Bible Paul got it from the Old Testament amen so there is salvation in the Old Testament Paul proved that that all right the seven eyes eyes means seeing seeing means prophets seers this lamb had seven horns and on each horn had an i7 eyes what is it Christ and his bride now that's not Christ in the denomination that's not Christ in 144,000 that's not Christ in the Old Testament Saints that's Christ and his bride seven church ages out of there was seven prophets that went for seven seers so the last one must be a seer all right that all right say ma'am now let's look at number five here real quick we're not gonna be long I'm not stopping because we're gonna travel a couple hours down south but I didn't want I just wanted to bring this one piece before we start on the seals because look the seven horns and seven eyes are very important and like brother branham I didn't bring it I don't think but he says that's a funny-looking lamb when a lamb step four foots not a lamb it's a man but he's got seven horns and seven eyes on the end of the horn that by revelation though brother branham didn't see that because that would look kind of odd but he saw exactly what God wanted him to see John saw exactly what God wanted him to see and then look now watch the briefs the seals was broke while in the last church age to reveal these truths why he's asking the question why the lamb broke the seals and revealed them to his church in order to collect his subjects for his kingdom his bride oh my he wants to bring his subjects to him now I told you before what a what a patient god this waited for 2000 years God was excited he was so excited on the day of Pentecost till the excitement got into 120 they start shouting speaking in tongues and all these things and God has been shouting speaking in tongues all the way down to the seven churches and then why he wants to see his bride the way he's always he had this thing fixed before the foundation of the world and he knew that we were gonna fall he knew that all these things is gonna happen but he knew that he would bring it back to that place that he saw and that he could what hug him again hug him again bring him right back into fellowship not in heaven not in heaven people it's right here on the earth this has got to become a reality look at all the denominations all when this comes oh and look at half the people in the message oh when California sing oh when this great mighty man raises we have signs and wonders and healings at all when this happened listen we need to be aware of what was watching what is and what is to come but how many times did brother bran tell us that we miss what is happening now looking for some great something to come he told the Pentecostals he stood up in front of the whole nation of Pentecost and he said you're looking for something that's already happened and they're going he doesn't have yeah really that's what they did to let him believe him and you know what not believing him didn't make it right for them right the seals was broke why in the last Church age 2 revealed these things why the lamb broke the seals and revealed into his church in order to collect his subjects for his kingdom his bride see oh my he wants to bring his subjects to him now what is it out of the dust of the earth out of the bottom of the sea out of the pits out of everywhere in every place out of the regions of the dark look out of paradise wherever they may be he will call and they will answer he said a man twice he will call and they'll answer he come to get his subjects he revealed its secrets and they saw it there's the key they saw it if you don't see it you don't know what's happening that's what the Pentecostal said all day right brother Branham what do you mean what we're looking for this great something to come crying for a prophet wrote it in all their papers God sent us a prophet God sent us the Prophet he walked among them for years but remember he was vindicated and being vindicated it didn't matter what the impending officer said he was the man of the time whether they liked it or not same way with us you and I we've got to answer the call of today not the call of yesterday and not the caller tomorrow we got to answer the call today the call of today is is like I told you before we got to have that voice of a resurrection in our heart that those dead Saints can't stay in that other dimension anymore they got to come here I saw a lot of people yesterday of course a lot of them weren't weren't Christians someone hadn't darkened the door of a church probably ever right but they were looking downstairs nobody a there was a lot of them looking at those pictures of all the young the people that had passed on and I saw him kept looking and kept looking and they were looking at him you know so when I got up here I kind of told him that you know it's talking about June's mom she's 83 years old if she was a Christian that's her that's her business she professed Christianity that's all I got to say she professed Christianity in him she did then she's not gonna walk back in here at 83 years old any kind of some of them it kind of startled him I said look downstairs all those people were old when they died but you see young pictures down there don't you you don't say old picture that's the way we'll say them that's what that power that's what that power that's in us now he revealed his secrets and they saw it and time is no more at that time time has run out it's finished listen when you sin and come to it it's finished for you and I our problem is is we still want to make something happen well just lady just read the word let it happen a man said okay because when he said look when it says time has run out it's finished folks that's our body change when our body is changed in this time element time will be no longer for us time is really no longer for you and your soul it never is listen that Genesis 1:26 man is not one second older we talk about God we talk about guarding up being one second older what's then women when he spoke let there be like that Genesis 1:26 man is not a second older than when God said let us create man in our image it's got to be as eternal as God alright so these seven horns and seven eyes there are seven Church ages and they're seven seers se ers that come through those seven churches and they all wrap up in Revelations five when he takes that book now when he takes that book what he's got to do though is he's got to break it to this end time people I read to that a little while ago he's got to break it to us he's got to break the seals to us they were not broken Paul was a to the degree that we get it they get a portion because Jesus preached six seals back in Matthew Jesus preached six ales 2,000 years ago so brother Branham then is not bringing something that's brand-new he's revealing what had been what man had hid man had put the hand over the eyes of the people listen God would never put his hand over your eyes I thought open the eyes of my heart Lord it'd be real hard to say Lord closed my eyes no open my eyes open my understanding to what you got and that's what's gonna happen with leave when we go into these seals I want you to we're gonna read this one quote and then we'll be finished but keep this in your mind that God is doing the work it's not a man it's God doing the work God is going to take these seals and he's going to help us understand them more we have an understanding of the seals everybody everybody knows now that white horse rider it's holy ghost its Antichrist but that's the seal that sealed something that we can't see you put a seal on something what does that do you put a seal on it you can't say but when that seals tore back you can see everything in it look you can't see what's in the box cars to seal still on it and that does you no good the seal is what your sealed until the day of your redemption full redemption what's in that mom's car that's what's going to redeem you the seal is not going to redeem you the seal is what when you when it's broke I was thinking about this other day you know a long time ago we'd have a lot of things sealed up ketchup and mustard and why because somebody started tampering with it remember the tylenol scare in the 80s were somebody put some tainted stuff and he killed a bunch of people why there was no seal our protection I hope you get this there's no seal or protection on the product it was just open for anybody but once you sealed it up it was protected but I didn't tylenol didn't quit making town at all they just sealed it up so only a certain group of people can get it and that's you and I the mass of the new you know good you can take what man I got a good seal on this on this tylenol but boy my head's you're hurt what you got to do take the seal off and see what and get don't just see what's inside get what's inside hey man God seals your soul where Satan can't touch it and man he steals your soul so Satan can't touch it so the only person that can touch your soul if it's sealed is God himself God Almighty Himself the only one that can take your soul cuz remember he's the only one that can make it live and he's the only one who can make it die because he created he said don't worry about the guy that makes the body he said you worry about that guy that can what kill that salt hey man so if he's already done his work and put a seal which is the Holy Ghost seal then everything that's behind there when we pull that seal off there's all the vitamins there's all the product that we can use and same can't tamper with it because remember it's not for everybody that was the problem in the first place tylenol said well this is for everybody we're just going to put a cap on it well what Satan slips in and stick some poison definitely in it put some poison down in it and what he he makes it look like it's seal comes remember he's what he's a he is not an originator he's a pervert ER the tylenol was good until Satan got involved and he put a little bit of poison in it but when God sealed that thing up he said it's sealed and now only a certain group of people remember they put a childproof cap on those things well it's adult fruit for some I'm making a point here they put this they put the childproof cap on so what children can't get in it but supposedly an adult can open it a wife can open it that Alright a wife can open it okay let's go to number six now what let's let's go to the first seal and we're gonna read this and I want you to think about it but take that to heart God said if God seals something it was free you you you not the devil not the world when he sealed it up he said only a certain group of people is gonna get this but all when they get it you got a big headache Tyler I was good one of the beasts says come and see that's his first seal will close right here he heard the noise of a thunder and one of the beasts said now come and see in other words here stands the Lamb and John standing out there watching it happen and the lamb comes up from the throne like he'd been slain blood all over him and he was the one that was found worthy and when he reached over and took the book then everything began shouting screaming and carrying on because they knew redemption was paid for now let me interject something John was already sealed in his soul when he was seeing this thing happen so he wasn't worried about his soul he was worried about me and you get him out of the ground right that's what he was worried about he said in fact if we don't come to full Redemption we're in trouble amen so truly they're waiting on us Paul is waiting them in you John talked the whole anti-bride he's in a grave somewhere and god bless his soul we know where soul is but his body's probably just dust it's been 2,000 years since he's been dead it's probably just dust gotta bring you back together he knows words that don't worry about that now he's come lamb come up for the throne he'd been slain blood all over him he was the one that was found worthy and when he reached over and took the book then everything began shouting screaming carrying on you see because they know Redemption was paid for now he comes to claim his own so he takes the book stands out there before John and he pulls it back and breaks to seal pulls the seal down and when he pulls the seal down a thunderclap through the place and when a thunderclap no doubt John might have jumped up in the air when the thunder roared and then one of the four beasts now look what are the four beasts the four beasts is the Holy Ghost we can get into the line ox and all those but it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost God sent the Holy Ghost to what lead us and guide us into all truth but there is a lion anointing there's an ox anointing there is a man anointing and there's an eagle anointing that brings us through the steps of the baptism of the holy oak all right it's not for different holy go okay because you and I need the boldness of a line the work of an ox we have to have the intelligence of man not that man I'm gonna buy a man a man that's not man's intelligence no but what God did know is during that time of the man intelligence he brought Luther and Wesley and that's when the printing presses started that's when man was able to put this book together so people could read it and then so he did use the intelligence of man but one of the four beasts is now come and see what it is what's revealed beneath there remember we're talking about that what's beneath here it wasn't a seal it was what was underneath all right so John goes to look see what it is John goes to see what that's understand it's then that this creature told John come and see what the mystery is under the first seal the thunder the voice of the Creator has uttered it's not a voice of a man and watch seven people not seven men it's the voice of the Creator now he ought to know what's there it's kind of plain but faint now he wrote this but when he started to write those seven other seven thunders he said don't write them he'd been commissioned to write everything he sang but when these seven thunders over in Revelations 10 uttered he said don't write them at all their mysteries we don't know what they are yet but my opinion they'll be revealed right away and when it do it'll give faith for that rapture and grace for that church to move out now the only thing that then then stop the quote for a second the only thing I see then it's the is the thunders is for rapturing faith when that ratcheting faith has to have a body change in there somewhere we can't take a rapture without the body change so let's just let's just we're not assuming that's a fact we can't take a body change after the rapture so we got to take the body change first well we just moved through everything that we know of look through all we just move through everything that we know of through all the dispensations we've watched everything we just talked about them just now we've seen the mysteries of God see what saying we've seen the mysteries of God we've seen the appearing of the great gallery together of the bride in the last days but yet there's something in there that we just can't lighten ourselves with there's something another but I imagine when the mistress begins to come forth God said hold it back now wait a minute I'll reveal it in that day don't ride it all John look comes down stagger over it man staggers over Redemption right much less full redemption but less showing that a mortal man that was born in sin shaping in a necklace by from his mother's womb in life can be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye and have a body like Jesus's body and not ever have to worry about it deteriorating or ever have to worry about a pain cuz they'll stagger over it now listen you and I shouldn't stagger over that just let it go see but I'll reveal it in that day when it has need to done Paul didn't need it right Iranians didn't need it Luther didn't need it Wesley didn't need it Pentecost didn't need it this has come now to the needy time we need it now this right here is now not history its present all the profit preach the good message and that's okay listen to build our faith we need to stinking and somebody saying something other day about just you know going through and listening to the prayer lines that's okay that's alright that's not wrapped in faith that will help you that'll help you sure but that's not wrapped in faith brother Browne said it wasn't he said not me years of preparation not in the healing campaign he said but when that messenger brings his message they really enjoyed that hurry who we did the church ages in the and the gap there in the and the headstone coming in brother Tim said about five times he really enjoyed how we brought it out but that's something we got all get our mind out of the church ages he that overcomes going to get something but 100 percent of the church ages except for were still in Laodicea are dead let's say ninety nine percent ninety nine percent of everybody that is in this kingdom of God let's stand their feet everybody it's pi stone they're waiting on somebody that's alive to take this thing and sweep it onto the coming of the Lord that's our commission if not you were gonna sit here another ten years and go to more funerals none of us are promised today but we're promised if we're sealed in that we have eternal life and nobody listen God Himself can't take it away from a man God Himself cannot give you eternal life in your soul and take it away from her can't do it sure you get an anointing be careful what you said well this brother sort was he just anointed our deity have his soul sealed in where nothing can touch it Amen this thing song brother at least I liked it I got you you got your hands-free sounds good yes I like this it's working pretty good Amen man let's let's sing when the redeemed are gathering in I think gonna try to do it an F amen yeah Bernie just thinking of the rapture eatin our blessed home on high wintry day every year I will
