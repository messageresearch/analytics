[0:00] yeah all rights record good okay all
[0:04] right here we are in Romans 12 excuse me
[0:08] we were let's go back to three two one
[0:14] then we'll go down and we'll stop them
[0:16] I'm busy beseech you therefore brethren
[0:18] by the mercies of God that you present
[0:20] your bodies a living sacrifice holy
[0:21] acceptable unto God which is your
[0:23] reasonable service or rational service
[0:30] in other words we're supposed to act
[0:32] different you know then the more code
[0:36] says be not conformed to this world
[0:38] because listen you were formed in this
[0:40] world the flesh part of you was formed
[0:43] in this world your spirit came from
[0:45] another world the Holy Ghost is
[0:47] definitely from another legs but he come
[0:49] into this place and resides in you
[0:51] so that's what the paradox come from
[0:54] don't paint into them but as it got hung
[0:56] up in Illinois sending me pictures of
[0:58] deer so don't worry about this you won't
[1:01] see this no no we got we're gonna do
[1:03] this first then you can see this no my
[1:05] wife wants to snuggle bear' snowmaking
[1:08] machine next year I think let her stand
[1:13] out the argument be not conformed to
[1:17] this world but be transformed by the
[1:19] renewing of your mind so it doesn't
[1:21] start with your mind as far as your gray
[1:26] matter because it's the same as it was
[1:28] when you went morning in but it's an
[1:30] filter it's what flows through that now
[1:32] when we sing the song flow do me Holy
[1:34] Spirit I think about that it he's not
[1:36] falling through your mind okay he's in
[1:40] your heart but he's trying to flow
[1:42] through the other parts that you know
[1:44] Graham talking about the flues getting
[1:45] stumped up well he can't flow right if
[1:48] you got flu stopped up but be not
[1:51] conformed to this world would be
[1:52] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:56] that you may prove they may prove what
[1:59] God is doing is true
[2:00] through you write that you may prove
[2:03] what is that good and acceptable and
[2:05] perfect will of God which is his word as
[2:09] well as always his word right for I say
[2:12] through the grace given unto me to every
[2:15] man that is among you
[2:17] and sister not to think of himself more
[2:20] highly than he ought to taint now what's
[2:21] he telling him he comes up and tells
[2:23] around here do not be conformed to this
[2:25] world but prove the goodness that one
[2:27] perfect will of God so in other words
[2:29] don't think yourself any better than
[2:31] anybody else don't think yourself any
[2:33] better then that drunk on the street
[2:35] there's no devil snare drum on street oh
[2:37] thank God brother Brennan brought that
[2:39] out he says there's no difference in
[2:41] them and you except for the whole ego
[2:42] yeah caleche what's the determining
[2:44] factor in the bottom line you know you
[2:46] said well I'm we're up here with it
[2:48] bottom line is the drunk don't have the
[2:50] Holy Ghost you have the Holy Ghost so
[2:52] that's the bottom line
[2:53] right so don't think so much of yourself
[2:58] miss God did does it because it says for
[3:02] I say through the grace given unto me to
[3:04] every man that is among you think of a
[3:06] man that the grace was given to this man
[3:08] named Paul that his brother forty was
[3:10] talking last night literally had
[3:13] Christians killed literally not just
[3:16] figuratively he hated up the posse that
[3:20] rounded up the Christians and how until
[3:23] he even says he said I even calls him to
[3:24] bless me now what about a man then God's
[3:29] going to use one day but he's the one
[3:32] that's tormenting the Church of God
[3:34] right so I said so through the grace
[3:37] given unto me to every man that is among
[3:40] you not to think of myself more highly
[3:41] than he ought to think but to think
[3:44] soberly according as God has dealt to
[3:46] every man the measure of faith and
[3:48] that's true we don't all have the same
[3:49] measure some are just real faithful
[3:53] people and some are just have faith and
[3:55] don't have to pray a whole lot some have
[3:57] to enter inch but you know what it
[3:59] doesn't matter I said bottom line is
[4:01] you're Christians and God dealt with you
[4:05] the measure of faith he knew how much
[4:07] you can take how much you come listen
[4:09] God know the whole thing yeah
[4:11] you knows what you believe what you
[4:12] don't believe all the way in but we
[4:15] don't and that's good
[4:16] good if we don't know the exact future
[4:20] no we know the future but we don't know
[4:22] the exact future you know it says in
[4:23] there what we're gonna do like brother
[4:24] twenties don't know there will be a body
[4:27] change and then that body changes
[4:30] through that light just gonna keep
[4:31] rolling and it's going to create a
[4:32] rapture yeah and just gonna keep
[4:34] creating you know keep rolling and gonna
[4:36] put us in them in them you know in what
[4:39] you want to say the marriage supper then
[4:41] in a millennium and it's gonna roll this
[4:42] right in the future home does it's gonna
[4:44] stop at once des destroyed any Christian
[4:46] but until that time we still have
[4:50] struggles and fights and all these
[4:51] different things for as we have many
[4:55] members in one body and all members have
[4:58] not the same office and that is correct
[5:01] we don't all have the same office our
[5:04] function like you know you look at if
[5:14] everybody was the CEO who's gonna do the
[5:20] work but you gotta have CEO you gotta
[5:23] have your financial people you gotta
[5:25] have your P&L people you have a profit
[5:28] loss person you gotta have your goddess
[5:31] and go down the dock puts the product in
[5:34] the car or in the truck you got the
[5:36] truck router and the truck driver you
[5:38] pay the truck driver to go do his job
[5:39] right yes all right so you gotta have
[5:41] that but you know what the CEO is very
[5:45] important but in fact I don't deliver
[5:46] that product that's the money part
[5:50] I mean idea filters back to the CEO but
[5:52] if that money's not exchanged or that
[5:54] products money came from you have no
[5:56] business so everybody is is basically if
[6:01] you look at a business you still wake up
[6:02] CEO but he's nothing if it's not for the
[6:04] guy that doesn't deliver
[6:06] he's nothing he said in his big office
[6:08] all he wants to but he ain't go getting
[6:09] the money in the bank account less the
[6:10] guy puts the product on the or puts
[6:14] product on your table get some money for
[6:17] it have you ever thought about that I
[6:18] mean being a little bit business money
[6:19] you said no you think when you're eating
[6:21] and you eat a meal and it cost you
[6:23] fifteen bucks which is about forty days
[6:25] now that will let me know about fifteen
[6:29] bugs but you think about that fifteen
[6:32] bugs that 15 bucks what does it do the
[6:35] same way with God I'm not getting off
[6:36] the subject but what do you do when you
[6:38] eat that and you pay that $15 that $15
[6:42] if you say it is McDonald's that $15 is
[6:45] keeping that store running paying the
[6:48] employee without first paying for the
[6:50] food you got to pay food cost which is
[6:53] usually about 30%
[6:54] so then you got 70% to work with out of
[6:57] that 70% you got to pay the light bill
[6:59] the gas bill the water bill
[7:01] pay an employee plant supervisor and
[7:05] then you got to stand a certain part of
[7:08] that $15 to corporate to pay corporate
[7:12] salary and then what's left over the
[7:15] shareholders get so out of that $15
[7:18] you're paying all that now you know you
[7:21] and I'm sure they break it down we used
[7:24] to break it down a little bit because
[7:25] you take percentages and usually you
[7:28] know you make about 5% so 5% of that $15
[7:31] is $7.00 and I mean 75 cents so 77 cents
[7:38] yep thanks Ken
[7:40] you were selling something say it's that
[7:42] Stephanie senses what profit at the end
[7:45] of that $15 Bo Tom everything's paid out
[7:47] you got 75 cents left over well same
[7:50] Wang died God is not God can set up
[7:53] there and he's a little different from a
[7:55] CEO of though he owns the whole world
[7:57] and everything in it and he destroyed
[8:00] him brain back but he used its members
[8:05] you say how him angels yeah well let me
[8:11] stop here him Satan
[8:15] thank breakdance a dryad maybe it was
[8:18] him Satan the angel come on down to man
[8:23] and then I'll come on down the man with
[8:26] the Holy Ghost
[8:27] giving us members of a church and you
[8:31] can break your time down the same way
[8:32] you take your 10% of time whatever it is
[8:34] 70 80 90 100 dollars a week you put it
[8:36] in five over one spot one supply dude
[8:39] five paid salary thanks for the last to
[8:42] stay on page for us to send money to
[8:44] overseas and thanks for all these
[8:45] different things but God has set that up
[8:49] that way so we be many one company
[8:55] that's one of the sister last nights and
[8:57] how in the world do y'all get all this
[9:00] to work as big as the crowd as y'all
[9:02] have I said well brother Brown didn't
[9:04] say we were an organization baby just
[9:06] say we were an organism and a company as
[9:09] an organism it has different things it
[9:11] works together as an organism to keep it
[9:13] together to keep it working the same way
[9:15] with your body if you didn't have them
[9:17] little big cells in your body did little
[9:19] organisms your body a small apartment
[9:22] this way right you got to have your cell
[9:24] wall you think well I've never seen one
[9:25] before well you put them all together
[9:27] and guess once you got you guys all this
[9:30] same way with God so we being many are
[9:33] one body in Christ which he is the head
[9:36] right and everyone members one of
[9:40] another in other words the guy taking
[9:42] the money at the register he's gotta put
[9:44] the money in the register he's got a
[9:45] manager's got to make sure the money
[9:48] goes into the bank the bank makes sure
[9:49] he goes to the corporate corporate makes
[9:51] sure to go to the shareholders
[9:53] shareholders to the owner or owner
[9:57] usually as a shareholder so same way
[9:58] with God he needs us he said he needs us
[10:03] he need the body down here now but see
[10:07] you got to go back to parent say well
[10:08] don't be somehow minded see that's where
[10:10] people think on earth here that are not
[10:13] born again they and
[10:14] Babaji are gods cuz you know what these
[10:17] people figured out all this business
[10:18] stuff without even being Christian its
[10:21] me take the guy from that was on ya beat
[10:29] though I mean look he's he stood up this
[10:32] great Empire but his wife's divorcing
[10:34] him and she's going to give about 330
[10:37] something billion dollars on his divorce
[10:39] settlement that ain't in God you know
[10:42] why because that's the imperfect man he
[10:45] set up a really good company he's got it
[10:46] running real good trust me my deliveries
[10:49] packages every day but being said that
[10:53] said but to have a perfect man in our in
[10:57] our government God Almighty right you
[11:03] say you got a government will have a
[11:05] government in the future home yes the
[11:09] kings of the earth will bring their till
[11:14] they must be some hierarchy out there
[11:15] somewhere but inside the city we're all
[11:18] one so you were talking about now the
[11:19] body of Christ that's why the body
[11:21] Christ is gonna be separated and we are
[11:23] going to live in a city but you know
[11:26] what we got twelve patriarchs we've got
[11:29] the twenty-four elders we got twelve in
[11:31] the Old Testament women in your
[11:33] Testament that's gonna set it somewhere
[11:35] because you see them when revelation
[11:37] five they're sitting on Thrones judging
[11:39] problems of Israel so this government's
[11:42] not bad when it's run by God okay
[11:45] government's wrong when the front of my
[11:46] man okay so be meeting one body in
[11:50] Christ everyone remember one of another
[11:51] in other words I gotta have my finger my
[11:54] hand would be nothing if I didn't have
[11:55] my fingers with me you know having then
[11:58] gifts differing according to the grace
[12:01] that is given to us until we each have
[12:04] gifts every one of us have a different
[12:06] gift whether prophecy let us prophesy
[12:08] according to the portion of faith of
[12:11] ministry let us wait on our ministry or
[12:14] he that teacheth on teaching or he that
[12:18] exhorteth on exhortation
[12:20] he they give it let him do it with
[12:23] simplicity or in other words
[12:26] let's see what that says in them liber
[12:29] liberality or in other words give it
[12:36] well no strings attached give it with
[12:38] with nothing - okay okay he that ruleth
[12:43] with diligence so he got a ruler yeah
[12:48] listen I don't mind you and I like we
[12:51] were talking about Sunday last onion we
[12:53] gotta have headship all of us brother
[12:57] Dale was our pastor he's our headship
[12:59] he's but now he has a head Christ so he
[13:01] lumps in his self into this body but
[13:05] he's in that chain of command that we
[13:07] that we have to respect that trailer
[13:09] come in collection week I set it up
[13:12] remember he said right here
[13:14] gifts prophecy ministry teaching
[13:19] rotation he did giveth
[13:22] he that rule it he's a show-off mercy
[13:25] with cheerfulness so we gotta keep
[13:29] ourself underneath that alright let love
[13:32] be without dissimulation in other words
[13:34] love be without hypocrisy because
[13:39] remember love is the most used word in
[13:42] the English language unions because we
[13:47] as Christians they're gonna want to know
[13:48] what real love is
[13:49] then you have some I say well I love
[13:51] football I love I love go hunting you
[13:53] know you say that you say these things
[13:54] but now they ain't love that's not the
[13:58] love guys talking about
[13:59] right no I enjoy going home I enjoy
[14:03] going fishing I mean oh boy but see the
[14:06] love has to be with God or I love Jim
[14:09] you know so that's your love that you
[14:11] give to who Christ yeah right let love
[14:14] be without dissimulation app or that
[14:17] which is evil cleave to that which is
[14:20] good in other words if you find
[14:22] something evil bob says resist the devil
[14:26] and he will flee from you cleave to that
[14:29] which is good so you have to determine
[14:31] which is good and evil but if we have
[14:32] the mind of Christ and we if we have all
[14:34] this filter coming down
[14:36] through apostles prophets pastors
[14:38] teachers evangelists God filters through
[14:40] their mind to talk to us then you and I
[14:44] have a part to do even though you're not
[14:46] a apostle prophet pastor teacher man do
[14:49] you have a situation where you go out
[14:51] into the world and they see you live in
[14:55] a different life for a Christian life
[14:56] and you tell them brother Brent until a
[14:58] fire got lit all right so you don't have
[15:00] to be standing on a street street corner
[15:04] with a guitar in the tambourine no just
[15:07] go to work
[15:08] be different they know you're different
[15:14] even your even your worth work ethic you
[15:17] know they I'm just I'm not gonna Pat
[15:20] myself on the back but listen I tell you
[15:21] I do do my job and I do it well so they
[15:25] gave me a Superman t-shirt for Christmas
[15:26] all the post all the postal employees
[15:28] and our thing gave me it meant Superman
[15:31] shirt for Christmas because they said
[15:33] you're super the other guy that I took
[15:34] his place was a sorry piece of mud I
[15:37] mean he was just complained and grabbed
[15:40] and never did anything out of kindness
[15:45] so I try to do that cuz I knew that guy
[15:48] was that weighing in you but you just do
[15:50] your job if you give it a job brother
[15:53] Paul say it a few but you gotta work if
[15:56] you don't work you don't need don't be a
[15:59] be like an ant see my bees my bees
[16:03] right now they're hibernating but you
[16:04] don't watch the bloom start blooming
[16:07] mama mama-mama queen don't have to go in
[16:11] there and say children it's time to go I
[16:14] said no there's something inside of them
[16:15] they know they're worker bees so they
[16:17] start bringing in to paly then the bee
[16:19] start cleaning the cells there's a
[16:21] different step for each one and they
[16:23] rotate as they die put the bee mm for 45
[16:27] days so the newbies that come out the
[16:29] new bees they come out they clean their
[16:33] room first they clean itself then they
[16:36] help with what's coming in because they
[16:37] don't
[16:38] laughing right now same way with kids
[16:40] and they nurture them inside they're
[16:43] called nurse bees they nurse the larva
[16:45] well when they start getting a little
[16:46] bit older and the bees that help beat
[16:49] their wings up going out and picking up
[16:51] pollen they die but when they do these
[16:53] just go out and get on the infant's
[16:55] board and they fly out and go get the
[16:57] part of the Necker and then this whole
[16:58] new group comes in so that's where God
[17:01] wants it to be done you know you don't
[17:03] like that itself yes same buddy with us
[17:05] dude out of a cheerful heart be kindly
[17:09] affectioned one to another with
[17:11] brotherly love and honour preferring one
[17:14] another not slothful in business see
[17:19] there Paul I'm slothful in business
[17:21] fervent in spirit serving the Lord
[17:26] rejoicing in Hope patient in tribulation
[17:30] that's our problem we could go into a
[17:32] trial and we we want to all we want the
[17:35] trial to last about that long actually
[17:37] no sorry we want it to last about that
[17:40] long the beginning and end of your
[17:42] tribulation has nothing in between no
[17:45] there's a time in there because we're
[17:49] coming up to the sixth seal today in
[17:51] that state seal is the tribulation seal
[17:54] all right the sixth seal is a
[17:56] tribulation seal so we're going to talk
[17:57] about that there tribulation first and
[18:01] then our population that worketh
[18:05] patience continuing instantly in prayer
[18:08] as we were talking before and here's an
[18:13] example I don't it's something who gets
[18:16] Dutch guys prayer requests leave well I
[18:19] get it every day
[18:20] all right and I like it because you
[18:21] don't want to do I don't sit and pray
[18:23] for each person individually
[18:24] I'll read the name street that he's room
[18:27] is pretty long bit sometimes and I'll
[18:31] read the names drew and I'll just say
[18:33] Lord those names now have been spoken
[18:35] you know what's behind them so Minster
[18:39] teach one all right now there is time
[18:43] when one week we need to have for a
[18:44] prayer okay
[18:48] something happens to our body here or
[18:49] our while for our family we should you
[18:53] said well you shouldn't do that well no
[18:55] that's what we're human being my kids
[18:58] are more important than your kids I
[18:59] don't care how bad my kids are my kids
[19:01] are more important than your kids okay
[19:03] same way with God same way with you so
[19:06] we're human being so let's just get the
[19:08] cut the jump that well you need to pray
[19:10] yeah you need to pray telling you for
[19:11] everybody but you're wrong you pray for
[19:13] you kid if he's in trouble a lot faster
[19:15] than your pray for somebody else's kid
[19:17] that's just the way it is that's just
[19:20] human being but when your kid goes to a
[19:24] problem we pray with you but you pray
[19:26] further so you know you see one instant
[19:29] in prayer distributing to the necessity
[19:31] of saints
[19:32] now I take that as you can we help a lot
[19:36] of people monetarily materially but the
[19:43] necessity of my Saints I say my Saints
[19:46] are things here is that we get the
[19:48] gospel to you give you an opportunity to
[19:52] take that gospel and let it be revealed
[19:55] to you see that's distributing to the
[19:57] necessity of the Saints because you
[19:59] can't there's no way that you can I wish
[20:03] there was that you could everybody makes
[20:05] a mount of money everybody lived in the
[20:07] same house kind of house everybody live
[20:08] drive the same car see that but see
[20:10] that's not God God's got a variety right
[20:13] so we distribute to the next successive
[20:15] be of the Saints because like I said go
[20:17] to the bottom line the bottom line is if
[20:19] we can come into a place anywhere we
[20:22] preach and we nurture the people give
[20:25] them something to sustain them that
[20:28] we've done our job not handing out money
[20:30] or handing out cars or handing out you
[20:32] know that can all go away
[20:39] city of the saints is the revelation of
[20:42] the word yes that's exactly what I would
[20:43] say yes that's inductor right yeah
[20:45] that's the only necessity you should be
[20:48] worried with to begin with
[20:50] it says needs and the needs of the st.
[20:53] brother I've said what we're needy
[20:54] people given to hospitality and we do
[21:04] that
[21:05] bless them what's persecute you we
[21:07] hardly do that we never do that
[21:16] really I mean you know what that's true
[21:23] brotherly kindness it's really easy for
[21:26] me love the weeks because I love the
[21:28] week
[21:29] but now for me to love somebody that's
[21:32] persecuted me and hates me and don't
[21:35] even wanna be in the same room in to
[21:36] walk up and shake hands and hug their
[21:38] neck and say I love you and mean it yeah
[21:40] please people that's almost entirely
[21:44] impossible but that easy part is not
[21:51] what guys talking about that brotherly
[21:53] kindness does not just make sure you
[21:54] love the people that love you forget
[21:56] everybody else
[21:57] brother I've said love those who hate
[21:59] you and if he loved those people that
[22:03] hate him you say well it can't be done
[22:04] well Billy Paul's no remember the story
[22:07] he said you won't could not tell who
[22:09] hated daddy and who loved him now
[22:11] brother Brad imbue it by his Irlen he
[22:14] knew who liked him and didn't like him
[22:16] but he said he treated everybody man now
[22:20] that's to me that's I get no nothing
[22:23] that's why that brother counties is up
[22:24] her next to there come the word one yes
[22:31] well bless them to forget sure much is
[22:35] asking you shall receive
[22:39] it means to speak well of that is to
[22:43] bless religiously to praise celebrate
[22:46] with praises in other words praise the
[22:48] God that hates you number three to
[22:51] consecrate a thing with solemn prayer
[22:53] you know what brother Graham told us he
[22:56] said pray for those well know the Bible
[22:59] says pray for those who despitefully use
[23:01] you can you do that you better be able
[23:05] to go that's a Christian life do I
[23:12] that's right gratefully and that's the
[23:14] only difference
[23:16] listen here we go bottom line again
[23:20] bottom line is you know through the Holy
[23:22] Ghost and through your training of being
[23:25] a Christian you know how to handle
[23:26] things a lot better and different than
[23:29] people in the world that's just bottom
[23:31] line cuz that's what the Holy Ghost was
[23:33] given for right it was given to what
[23:36] teach you things to come he said well ox
[23:38] revelation of the word yeah well okay
[23:41] but still we got to live a life here
[23:43] first
[23:44] you know it teaches you how to be nice
[23:46] to your neighbor be kind to this one
[23:48] Beck just like just like all this well
[23:49] Joe Graham did say to that there are
[23:53] some people just sure he meant
[23:59] Christians and that's true there's
[24:01] people I love but I just can't stand to
[24:03] be in the same ring within y'all of the
[24:04] same way some of y'all with me out there
[24:05] don't mind me don't bother me none lluís
[24:08] loves me and that's all there
[24:11] Luisa's this month yeah you have that's
[24:18] why I love jesus loves me this I know
[24:27] but bless them was persecuting you so
[24:30] that and as truly that's what we have to
[24:32] work on yes we do have to work on that
[24:34] that's that's what I said that brotherly
[24:36] kindness went down here you think
[24:38] brother kindness to be down here
[24:39] faithful in the Holy Ghost coming and
[24:41] you're so sweet and there was no but no
[24:46] it's up here when you've got all days
[24:48] man that probably kindness but here's
[24:51] the thing also I think a lot of people
[24:53] get condemned as well when they feel
[24:55] like they just don't like being around
[24:58] somebody that has nothing to do with you
[25:00] loving death or that you wouldn't do
[25:02] something for that is what I mean that
[25:03] love but there's just you can't right
[25:06] wait but we associate that love with oh
[25:10] well you love a brother because he's not
[25:13] the love of God in him but he might have
[25:15] a attitude right
[25:17] that's not determining his out is here
[25:21] because look these are all attitudes
[25:24] every one of these is the attitude of a
[25:26] human being trying to be trying to be
[25:32] reversed into the gods see that we take
[25:37] our human version changing into God take
[25:40] our human knowledge it's good I'm human
[25:42] ology but if you don't have well
[25:44] knowledge of God that's what that is so
[25:46] what is this doing is trying to change
[25:47] our nature deprivation all these all
[25:54] these are character traits they you
[25:57] weren't born you were born with but they
[25:59] were all going in that direction not
[26:00] enough amount we're trying to reverse
[26:03] this thing to go up this mountain it's
[26:05] man right and not fall that's why they
[26:07] call it a fall you have a fallen nature
[26:11] and you fight it and you fight it and
[26:15] you we know that all nature's dead on
[26:17] the inside if you're born again the old
[26:20] Xers dead on the inside
[26:22] but you gotta fight that nature that you
[26:25] were given they stick to contact this
[26:27] world with on the outside or in the
[26:29] middle and nothing not to flash you
[26:31] understand what I'm saying but the
[26:32] little guy I'm telling you that if we we
[26:35] must see this revelation this is not to
[26:38] make your soul better
[26:42] your soul is Genesis 1:26 it never it is
[26:46] God that's it but you'll spare me on
[26:50] before this right here happen you have
[26:54] to let that inside perfect man out that
[26:58] you're of a perfect man you have to let
[27:01] that perfect man out yeah and let him do
[27:04] his work because what you're doing is
[27:06] you let that imperfect man in and he
[27:12] helped I took a picture of dad when he
[27:18] was preaching when his head was right in
[27:21] this is in the background upstairs
[27:24] what's that got to do what we're going
[27:26] on here oh well we need to talk about
[27:30] what's going right here that's it okay
[27:32] all right cuz it gets me off my thought
[27:35] I just watchfulness don't ya
[27:41] you must you must love your worldly
[27:44] people more than you love you yes
[27:46] brother than sister it's easy to have
[27:48] these people in the room it really adds
[27:50] when you get down to love because you
[27:51] got the love of God but that guy they
[27:55] don't ever go to church that guy that
[27:58] you work with every day that talks about
[27:59] the naked women and this I've done this
[28:01] and I've drunk a beer and I went to a
[28:03] party and I had a big time with him and
[28:05] he's trying to get you he listened to
[28:07] him well you know what if you say you
[28:10] just think man that that just don't
[28:11] interest me at all but you know either
[28:15] do that or what are you gonna do you're
[28:16] gonna stay well bless God I'm a
[28:18] Christian no problem about that junk
[28:19] will mean the more I don't want to hear
[28:20] it no you've just turned him off right
[28:22] there and you know what he's thinking
[28:24] inside of himself if I have to act like
[28:26] that to be a Christian don't want to be
[28:27] one that's what I've always said a lot
[28:30] of people you look at them and you go
[28:31] well I'm they say I'm a Christian I said
[28:33] no look if I have to act like that to be
[28:35] a Christian I want hmm yeah I don't want
[28:37] to be that see so but this is what stop
[28:41] listen well they always taught us Peter
[28:45] told us what to do but Paul's wanted
[28:51] told us how to do it right Paul is
[28:54] telling us in all of his writings once
[28:56] that statue of a perfect man is revealed
[28:58] to you you will see it in every verse
[29:00] because who is that perfect man it ain't
[29:03] Samuel down it's Christ in that person
[29:09] and then you see it live down now saying
[29:12] who do you give the glory to you give
[29:13] the Lord Jesus Christ amen Hey bless
[29:17] them which persecute ya you gotta do
[29:19] that I mean that's just what and I have
[29:21] learned you all gotta learn in your
[29:24] Christian walk brother branham say it he
[29:27] would eat God God would have some
[29:31] brother our sister say something to you
[29:34] to test your faith or to see how you'll
[29:37] react no he said God would do it now
[29:40] listen that's not for government that's
[29:42] not for God's will be that's for yours
[29:46] listen God knew Moses he knew every
[29:50] minut second of Moses his life knew he
[29:53] was gonna be at one time almost God well
[29:58] I mean you know he was it was Christ in
[30:00] Moses but then he knows over here that
[30:03] Moses is gonna fall a little bit why
[30:06] Christ
[30:07] speak speak to the mouth how many speaks
[30:10] of the rock he did and he smote it but
[30:12] God you ever been to that but there did
[30:14] I was just didn't know so Moses is the
[30:18] one that has to look back on his life
[30:20] and say that had to be God that did that
[30:23] yes ma'am that's that's the way you have
[30:25] to look at you have to us that that had
[30:26] to be God that did that because the old
[30:28] me that's why I like being a human being
[30:32] and God enjoy being a human being
[30:35] because he came down here to become one
[30:38] to save like well Joel said like last
[30:41] night God didn't have to die now he come
[30:45] down here in human flesh has milk hasn't
[30:47] eaten different things captain of the
[30:48] host but when he came down here as
[30:50] himself he didn't have to die he didn't
[30:52] have to die a penalty for his sinful he
[30:55] was sinless he died on a cross for you
[30:59] and me for our sins he did not he was
[31:02] not penalized for being a human being he
[31:06] was penalized for your sin as a human
[31:09] being
[31:10] so if you'll see it that way you'll know
[31:11] why God had to come down here in human
[31:14] flesh died a death for you so that you
[31:17] don't have to die and then see we in the
[31:19] end time we get that revelation and I
[31:22] hope we'll discuss it more unto the
[31:24] Seventh Seal we get that revelation that
[31:27] there's zero zero that Christ has to
[31:32] come back and do that's right that's
[31:34] right zero that's pregnant see we we're
[31:38] going well work we need a body change
[31:40] and we need healing and we need Donnie
[31:43] caliber remember brother Brown he said
[31:46] if God was standing here tonight in a
[31:48] three-piece suit he said he could not do
[31:54] something
[31:55] to heal you yes right so he came to them
[32:00] they can't come back to do anything
[32:02] don't think Christ is coming back
[32:03] forward for me he's coming back to get
[32:07] his body he's coming back to get his
[32:09] pride
[32:10] I like brother Joe did this for me we
[32:12] nobody talked about the I am huh I made
[32:14] you a sermon a little bit later on yeah
[32:15] I am but what she the bride is in Christ
[32:18] and all these things he's making a
[32:19] cumulated list of what brother branham
[32:23] told us we work okay cuz that's what he
[32:27] come back for he come back for uh a
[32:29] bride that actually he had before the
[32:32] foundation of the world because we can't
[32:35] not ever be his bride and then become
[32:38] his bride
[32:38] we always was his bride but he had to
[32:42] marry Israel first for all your tights
[32:45] to come into Vietnam all you types to
[32:47] come into view Naomi and Ruth they had
[32:50] to be an older one there to be an older
[32:52] woman that he married not so much old
[32:54] and age but the Old Testament he had to
[32:57] be married to them first good you know
[32:58] what he said listen he sent some of the
[33:02] greatest prophets in the Old Testament
[33:04] that ever walked on the face of this
[33:06] earth major prophets and minor prophet
[33:10] David Moses Abraham look at all these
[33:13] ones that he that he brought into being
[33:15] in the Old Testament and what they do to
[33:19] them they kill them yeah did he come
[33:21] himself in the middle of the book but
[33:24] now you say well Paul Iranians Martin
[33:26] well what a palms on when I wrote the
[33:28] Bible all the mother Old Testament
[33:29] Testament prophets wrote his estimate
[33:32] Moses was given five books to write then
[33:36] you got Ezekiel and Jeremiah and all
[33:38] these they wrote the physical Bible
[33:42] Irina's did not nepali big arenas did
[33:46] Martin didn't Columba did Luther didn't
[33:49] Wesley didn't sure they've been talked
[33:50] about in the Bible but they didn't write
[33:52] anything brother I've never wrote
[33:54] anything that's right he just gave us an
[33:56] amplified amplified version of what
[33:58] already had been written yes
[34:01] I mean look literally if we would have
[34:05] stayed with Paul's teaching
[34:07] I'm gonna get crucified for this one we
[34:10] wouldn't need brother Brenner
[34:11] if we stayed with Paul's teaching
[34:15] because what brother Brown come back
[34:17] come to do he come to do two things I
[34:18] know he come to the second part but the
[34:20] first part was to restore what was
[34:22] already in the old tent
[34:23] I'm in the book back from 47 to 63 a
[34:28] large part of brother Rams ministry was
[34:30] just to get us back to what was already
[34:32] in the Bible man had just met haven't
[34:34] made a mess of it right now we know he
[34:38] come to bring the seals and all but you
[34:39] know what Jesus preached the seals and
[34:41] Matthew let's back up a little bit
[34:42] farther than Jesus already preached to
[34:44] see Matthew 24 we're gonna read this
[34:47] afternoon he preached the seals Paul
[34:51] preached to all the major doctrines what
[34:54] was left brother mom had to come to
[34:57] restore back their lives a ministry to
[34:59] restore back and then not listen I just
[35:03] revealed to him reveal to a group a
[35:07] small real small group of people the
[35:10] revelation of the seal real small group
[35:13] of people no I just wanted it I was just
[35:15] wondering if what whether Brendan says
[35:17] that the Pentecostal Saints see they
[35:21] were closer to a rap to a rapture than
[35:23] we are one because they had the word
[35:25] down right okay they had the word down
[35:28] right but remember they didn't have
[35:31] enough for a body change because that
[35:33] had to come back with the son of man but
[35:35] now remember back on up Jesus already
[35:40] took about a penny right before the book
[35:44] of Acts he took a body change so there's
[35:46] everything right here body change
[35:49] resurrection one I'm sorry death burial
[35:53] resurrection glorified body was all
[35:59] before we even got to hold it up the
[36:02] whole that's what I'm telling you if
[36:03] brother branham's told us and I agree
[36:05] 100% if Jesus was to step in there
[36:08] right here today he could not change
[36:10] nobody he'd say look to me it's already
[36:12] done I wrote it right here it's in here
[36:14] somewhere
[36:14] you gotta find it but I'm already
[36:18] changed so if I change here change if
[36:20] brother Brown simply walked the shores
[36:22] of Galilee with Jesus Christ
[36:23] we were crucified with him we were
[36:26] resurrected with him so we obviously
[36:28] were changed with him we just got that
[36:32] carnal nature that still yeah that's one
[36:44] understand yes yeah yeah that's what
[36:51] we've been that's what we're saying
[36:52] brother Graham had to come to do the
[36:56] first part and then the second part
[36:57] would now remember Peter reveal a sealed
[37:02] room nobody that's right only Christ can
[37:08] reveal anything so who was it preaching
[37:12] those sealed series it was God himself
[37:16] but who did he change it didn't even
[37:24] change brother brother because he was
[37:26] prophesying of a group when he stood
[37:28] there on its own that questions and
[37:30] answers on the seal he was prophesying
[37:32] of a group to come so he had to pass
[37:35] away because you can't be a prophet and
[37:39] take a body chain
[37:42] you can be a prophetic people but you
[37:46] can't prophesy because the prophecy is
[37:48] I'm standing here and I'm prophesy of
[37:52] sister Barbara doing something I'm not
[37:57] prophesy to me I'm promise that God is
[37:59] talking through me and I'm problem
[38:01] that's why then she's got to say who's
[38:05] gonna change my body brother Dale you I
[38:08] am make it personal
[38:13] who's gonna change it he didn't he does
[38:15] not say if you say drew a profit this
[38:19] mountain to be moved Jesus turned one
[38:22] day and he said if you say cuz this
[38:25] mountain be moved and down on your heart
[38:26] I know brother Browns listen it's kind
[38:29] of tricky brother Graham said we have
[38:30] the staff to order be still but now this
[38:32] said Lord not going to change obey we
[38:37] get in some stuff here from the staff
[38:38] the Lord will not change your body it
[38:40] never changed nobody else's buddy
[38:41] Jesus never said that stay up the Lord
[38:44] and he got a body chain got him fully
[38:50] stocked fridge
[38:53] we didn't get down when we started
[38:55] playing with that last week
