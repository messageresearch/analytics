[7:58] Matthew 19
[8:12] the Pharisees came unto Him tempting him
[8:14] and saying unto Him is it lawful for a
[8:17] man to put away his wife forever cause
[8:20] and he answered and said unto them have
[8:22] you not read that he which made them at
[8:24] the beginning made them male and female
[8:27] said for this cause shall a man leave
[8:29] his father a man leave father and mother
[8:32] and shall cleave to his wife and they
[8:35] twain shall be one flesh
[8:36] wherefore there are no more Twain but
[8:38] one flesh what God therefore hath joined
[8:41] together let not man put asunder they
[8:45] say unto him why did Moses then command
[8:47] to give a writing of divorcement and to
[8:49] put her away he said unto them Moses
[8:51] because of the hardness of your hearts
[8:53] suffered you to put away your wives and
[8:56] for but from the beginning it was not so
[8:58] and I say unto you whosoever shall put
[9:00] away his wife except it be for
[9:02] fornication and shall marry another
[9:04] committeth adultery and whoso marrieth
[9:06] her which is put away doth commit
[9:09] adultery you may be seated the Lord had
[9:12] his blessing to the reading of the word
[9:14] we try to get on the into without
[9:22] talking about this morning about you
[9:26] know that we're supposed to marry
[9:30] believers and we were talking about what
[9:33] would be called believers and that
[9:35] brother Joe ran off the thing for me -
[9:38] you know this is taken from a message
[9:42] called paradox and brother Branham
[9:46] excuse me is referring to the fact that
[9:48] this man came to him talking about his
[9:50] son and he says now it's not easiest
[9:54] paragraph I got twenty paradox
[9:58] sixty-three I told one priest in Chicago
[10:03] now it is not easy to do something but
[10:06] you must be truthful and honest darfur
[10:08] the boy was a Christian as far as a
[10:10] believer he had repented had been
[10:12] baptized they had his position among the
[10:15] believers but yet had not received the
[10:18] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[10:20] no so you can see what is saying about
[10:23] him of what he would be he was bad
[10:25] he was everything so much of a believer
[10:27] but now look what brother Branham says I
[10:30] think it's a paid you son dude
[10:33] paragraph 30 and watch what he says and
[10:36] the father raised up and said my son
[10:39] went to the altar he was baptized
[10:41] correctly in the name of Jesus Christ
[10:43] and water baptism in the poo I said I
[10:47] know my son has come to Christ I said
[10:52] that may be all right all of the awkward
[10:56] motions he might be identified as a
[10:58] believer with the believers listen what
[11:02] he says but until he's regenerated born
[11:08] again I'd advise that young man to never
[11:12] marry a woman he'll make hell on earth
[11:16] for her until that gentle sweet
[11:19] forgiving spirit of Christ comes in then
[11:22] it'll be a paradox in itself so what is
[11:25] a believer a born-again Christian in
[11:30] order to marry born-again believers
[11:32] right now listen to what brother George
[11:35] Smith says on his testimony about when
[11:38] he asked brother Branham about marrying
[11:43] Rebecca he goes through the point that
[11:47] he was talking with brother Branham you
[11:49] know and a couple of hours and I can't
[11:51] it finally says now I really enjoyed
[11:54] this but I need to know if I can marry
[11:56] your daughter
[11:58] that's George speaking the rest right
[12:01] sure George he told me you can become
[12:05] engaged now but don't even think about
[12:08] getting married until after you receive
[12:10] the Holy Ghost so what is a believer he
[12:16] goes only gives his testimony of
[12:17] receiving the holy God all right so what
[12:20] is a believer a born-again Christian a
[12:25] believer amen
[12:27] just pray for one another I certainly
[12:30] appreciate something to see somebody
[12:33] like brother Gary and his dad in the low
[12:35] time as it is but it is here today so
[12:38] that's a great testimony
[12:39] that's a direct testimony to him to be
[12:41] here in the service instead of being
[12:43] dark I appreciate that
[12:48] that's an honor to me because a lot of
[12:51] people want to have a headache to get to
[12:54] miss church but that's alright alright
[12:57] now let's get into a thought we've been
[12:59] trying to cover on some things and we
[13:02] went through it this morning and I hope
[13:04] that's my plane talking and trying to
[13:06] express to you at least what I believe
[13:10] and that way then you know you can
[13:14] consider the point and as we read that
[13:19] part you ought to be a Christian because
[13:21] you know now you say our will they all
[13:24] be that no only everybody won't be that
[13:26] way and everybody say with everybody
[13:28] here be that way now they probably won't
[13:30] not probably wouldn't either five back
[13:32] there I'm just honest but that's the way
[13:35] it ought to be we ought to be a
[13:37] Christian if we as a Christian that was
[13:39] to sum up what I was saying this morning
[13:41] what happened to the message of a
[13:43] Christian life wise the people of this
[13:46] message have to read to not do this or
[13:50] not do that when the Holy Ghost order
[13:51] took care of that
[13:53] you know in their lives all right
[13:56] you didn't have to come into the message
[13:59] to learn how not to see in you order Ben
[14:02] if he's a born-again Christian you're to
[14:03] had had no problem with it but that's
[14:06] that's alright now let's see I ended up
[14:09] talking about that you know the Prophet
[14:14] was saying that you could only marry a
[14:16] virgin well I I put that as much as
[14:20] blunt as I could and just say that yes
[14:22] and then continue on with the message
[14:25] Paul speaks of both man and woman having
[14:28] a virginity and the problems with it of
[14:32] things you know and how it ought to be
[14:34] done maybe we need to spend months on
[14:37] that you know just talking on it but
[14:39] still it ought to be sensible to know we
[14:42] say well now this only for the woman no
[14:43] no said he could put her away from you
[14:47] know he can put her away and marry again
[14:48] that's right if he's got the grounds
[14:51] scriptural grounds
[14:53] if he hasn't been he's causing her to
[14:55] commit adultery and he'll wind up in
[14:57] adultery itself because he'll go off and
[15:00] get married and claim his okay well I'm
[15:02] just too blunt and sorry to point you
[15:04] know to to be anything he said well they
[15:06] just no hopes for none of us well if I
[15:09] could preach salvation to get us to
[15:11] realize that I would be tickled to death
[15:15] if I could preach salvation that
[15:17] everybody in here got to the position
[15:20] myself to that we realized we were so
[15:23] lost and doomed and on our way to hell
[15:25] if we had no hopes but then we could do
[15:28] something about it you know we could
[15:31] seek God well I started off talking you
[15:34] know that the marriage and divorce has
[15:36] to be revealed seek God for a revelation
[15:39] about your wife your husband if we
[15:41] depraved before we married there would
[15:44] have been a lot of difference in the
[15:45] marital situations in people's lives but
[15:48] we didn't pray we just you know we
[15:50] didn't we wouldn't talk to pray about
[15:52] that in different things but anyhow now
[15:56] see the only grounds for him to put away
[16:01] his wife and marry again is for her to
[16:04] committed fornication or adultery all
[16:07] right that's not to just for any calls
[16:09] or any talk that's plain and blunt but
[16:14] it's the truth now you show me something
[16:16] else in the Bible and the prophets
[16:18] message see so that leads every one of
[16:22] us in a horrible situation of life but
[16:26] if we can believe in grace grace can
[16:29] make away
[16:31] it has made away and it will make away
[16:34] I believe that all right now so to get
[16:37] on from that thinking about it and doing
[16:40] as I said now most people think that the
[16:42] man can for any reason woman she can
[16:45] never and we agree with the woman that
[16:47] she can never but not with a man for any
[16:49] reason you overboard either way that
[16:52] you're trying to go so we're going with
[16:54] the basis of what he must be a virgin
[16:57] she must be a virgin and then that way
[16:59] you know when they remarry
[17:01] if something happen if the woman dies
[17:04] and she was a virgin to start with
[17:06] and she her husband's dead she's free to
[17:09] marry she's still a virgin well wouldn't
[17:13] he be the same time if he was a virgin
[17:17] when he started and his wife died
[17:19] wouldn't he still be we'll see that way
[17:21] you wouldn't be breaking any Scripture
[17:24] you wouldn't be causing any problems you
[17:28] know but see by misinterpreted theology
[17:30] which to me is you know by the fact that
[17:33] preachers didn't explain to us about the
[17:36] lives we needed to live they just wanted
[17:39] us in the altar I'm not throwing off on
[17:41] nobody but you know it's the truth they
[17:43] wanted a million more than 44 they
[17:46] wanted more members in the church and
[17:48] and that's why preachers won't preach on
[17:50] marriage and divorce in this message the
[17:52] others I know for sure why people don't
[17:54] want me to come to their church and
[17:56] preach I understand see they're afraid
[17:58] of me
[17:59] the afraid I might preach I'm an ex in
[18:01] divorce you know they're afraid I'm not
[18:04] preaching daniel-san new ways or
[18:06] something you know I understand that and
[18:09] there's no problem I don't know I'm
[18:11] tickled to death about it myself because
[18:13] I get to stay at home and be happy and
[18:15] not have to worry about it
[18:16] and I ain't got the burden of the world
[18:18] on my shoulders these preachers ought to
[18:19] realize so you've got this congregation
[18:22] is on my shoulder and if I don't tell
[18:26] you the truth you might make it but I
[18:29] won't if I withhold the truth from you I
[18:32] won't make it but you might be able to
[18:36] well see I've got to try to I want a
[18:39] clear conscience mad enough as it is it
[18:42] you know you go to bed at night praying
[18:45] and saying Lord what did I can I do what
[18:47] can I say to get us to realize
[18:50] realization if you don't know you need
[18:53] grace you won't work you won't seek I've
[18:57] tricked if you think you come into the
[19:00] world saved you're not going to seek the
[19:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost right you're
[19:05] not gonna seek after God if you think
[19:07] you're saved you're gonna say I am saved
[19:10] and then you're gonna have the theology
[19:12] that we had you know in the bag just
[19:14] well I can't deny that I'm saved
[19:16] I believe Lord save me now and I can't
[19:19] do that confide in
[19:21] I'm lost well Amen if you got it but
[19:26] what if you don't have it see how easy
[19:31] that devil with that old lie and that's
[19:33] what I told Mike this morning that old
[19:35] serpent seed it's not the end of course
[19:41] in the garden is in the course of the
[19:42] mind of the human being where Satan is
[19:46] planting his seeds inside of us and
[19:49] we're trying to get it old unmodeled in
[19:52] a brain that can't work you know in
[19:55] doing it but now let's just get on and
[19:58] you know and I should have preached this
[20:00] to begin with when I said I've said this
[20:02] time I'm trying to go through and just
[20:04] bar down on some points because I
[20:07] preached this so many times until a lot
[20:09] of you could tell the page numbers I'm
[20:11] going to on it but we're gonna finally
[20:13] get around to the one I should have
[20:15] started with or gently start marriage
[20:16] and divorce is this asking you what
[20:18] ground what is a marriage what does it
[20:23] take to constitute a marriage or what is
[20:27] a wedding what is a marriage see a lot
[20:31] of people believe is when you you know
[20:33] finally consummate it you know going to
[20:37] bed together so same ago
[20:39] well let's see the day if we can look
[20:41] through that and just disprove that
[20:43] totally scripturally out of the way I
[20:47] know that say consummating you know you
[20:53] know that's a bringing it to a finality
[20:56] of becoming one in the basis of that
[20:59] point but it's still not a wedding
[21:02] wedding should be way before then all
[21:07] right so let's go into it now let's just
[21:11] read some scriptures and just think
[21:12] about some things and and you know go on
[21:15] in what we're trying to talk on and then
[21:19] we'll be tickled to death to have
[21:21] questions and answers I have got a few
[21:24] comments and few things I appreciate it
[21:26] you know and I appreciate you you being
[21:30] honest enough to ask me and I'll do the
[21:33] best
[21:34] can to answer you as honest as I can
[21:36] well let's go with Genesis and just see
[21:39] because marriage started in Genesis now
[21:45] so let's just read what it says in
[21:48] Genesis and just follow the line and the
[21:52] thought what is a marriage what does it
[21:55] constitute to be a marriage see a lot of
[21:59] people think this when you come down to
[22:01] the altar then you exchange your vows
[22:04] then you're married and I said others
[22:06] think that it's when you go on your
[22:08] honeymoon
[22:09] you know live together then you're
[22:12] married but what does the Bible say and
[22:16] what did the prophets say about a
[22:17] marriage no all right Genesis 2:18
[22:23] through 25 and the Lord said it is not
[22:26] good that the man should be alone I will
[22:28] make him a help meet for him not a
[22:30] helpmate that's not the word diary's
[22:33] help meet mate can be two men together
[22:36] meet is someone with you together
[22:39] joining one Adam and Eve was one right
[22:44] he didn't go somewhere that he didn't go
[22:47] and even and make her a body from the
[22:49] earth he took it out of Adam to her be a
[22:52] helpmeet alright and out of the ground
[22:55] the Lord God formed every beast of the
[22:56] field and every fowl of the air and
[22:57] brought dinnerland to Adam to see what
[22:59] he would call him and whatsoever Adam
[23:00] called every living creature that was
[23:02] the name thereof and Adam gave names to
[23:05] all the cattle into the fowl of the air
[23:07] and to every beast of the field but to
[23:09] Adam there was not found and help meet
[23:12] for him and the Lord God caused a deep
[23:17] sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and
[23:20] he took one of his ribs and closed up
[23:22] the flesh instead thereof and the rib
[23:24] which the Lord God had taken from man
[23:26] made a woman and brought her unto the
[23:30] man now watch what God says watch what
[23:34] Adam said first and then God says it and
[23:37] Adam said this is now bone of my bones
[23:39] and flesh of my flesh she shall be
[23:42] called woman because she was taken out
[23:44] of man
[23:47] we're gonna get to it in a minute that's
[23:48] when he proposed to Eve therefore shall
[24:04] a man leave his father and his mother
[24:06] this is God talking now and steal
[24:09] Cleveland to his wife and they shall be
[24:14] one flesh and they were both naked the
[24:17] man and his wife and we're not ashamed
[24:20] now God twice calls them that his wife
[24:26] all right now they had not lived
[24:31] together yet but yet God calls it the
[24:36] wife I had you'll you laughed at that
[24:40] point I said with you
[24:42] wait a minute we'll see what brother
[24:44] Brown had to say all right but listen we
[24:50] know that Dyer when God made them he
[24:53] made them beautiful he made him one
[24:58] that's what I've tried to express to you
[25:01] about the people caught talking about my
[25:03] products so much you know that they're
[25:06] trying to make her this piece of
[25:08] hamburger meat and he's a porterhouse
[25:09] steak or something you know all kind of
[25:12] thing remember they were the same
[25:14] substance same substance he didn't even
[25:22] choose to go in the animal kingdom to
[25:24] make her make Eve from another substance
[25:26] like the female dog was made you know
[25:29] they come out of the ground made to be
[25:32] what they were huh so he went into Adam
[25:37] to get Eve to take her out you know all
[25:41] right now if there was so much wrong in
[25:43] that and there's a kept emphasizing if
[25:48] it was some way that she made that was
[25:50] wrong or was made that she was wrong
[25:53] then she come out of Adam that would be
[25:55] him wrong yeah yeah if you really just
[25:59] just sat down and
[26:01] insensibly oh but we're not supposed to
[26:04] reason brother tail the Bible says come
[26:07] let us reason the Bible is the only
[26:12] thing that is reasonable this message is
[26:15] the only thing that's reasonable it has
[26:18] the answer to everything if we just
[26:20] search for him a little while
[26:22] but now what 2 times God refers to Eve
[26:27] being his wife all right now then if
[26:33] that's true then we don't have to be
[26:36] concerned about anything else we have to
[26:38] be concerned about what is it that
[26:41] really makes a wedding what is it that
[26:45] really makes you married they look at
[26:50] number two with what the Prophet had to
[26:51] say on the invisible union of the bride
[26:53] of Jesus Christ
[26:54] paragraph 74 marriage is the oldest
[26:58] Institute in the world marriage was
[27:02] performed first and instituted in the
[27:06] Garden of Eden
[27:09] no as always say Adam didn't have much
[27:14] choice about who his wife was gonna be
[27:16] cuz he to run out of ribs if he'd wanted
[27:20] something else that's just silly but
[27:24] it's true
[27:25] she come from him he she has a great
[27:31] sacredness she must not Mar if she does
[27:35] she's marked for life we'll get back to
[27:37] that one of these days the statements
[27:38] down at the bottom look what he says on
[27:43] number three the law having a shadow
[27:46] priest in 1954 12:03 look what the
[27:50] Prophet had to say that's where you'll
[27:53] see that I said he said this is bone of
[27:56] my bones he's proposing right there
[27:59] Darcy was a beautiful species and he
[28:03] picked her up in his arms and he looked
[28:06] at her and said why she's flesh of my
[28:10] flesh and bone of my bone
[28:13] bone as sweethearts when Almighty God
[28:18] squared them off and performed the
[28:23] marriage ceremony and he took her by the
[28:27] arm and down through the Eden he went
[28:29] perfect God's children do you see when
[28:35] Adam said what he said he was proposing
[28:40] to Eve God gave a ceremony you said well
[28:47] that's silly good I'm always silly but I
[28:50] love it and God says this is wonderful
[28:58] now you got to help me
[29:00] you remember the story you know God was
[29:03] lonely
[29:05] that's why he created the animals we
[29:09] were still lonely grated angels created
[29:12] animals he was still alone will he be
[29:16] any creative man somebody to fellowship
[29:18] with that was of the same form and being
[29:23] and somebody could talk to but then he
[29:28] saw Adam lonely so he took part of Adam
[29:33] and he made even took her to Adam and
[29:37] Adam said this is flesh of my flesh and
[29:39] bone of my bones
[29:42] she'll be called woman she never didn't
[29:44] even have a name you didn't get her name
[29:48] until the fall came cuz Eve is the
[29:52] mother of all living
[29:53] at that stage she was not the mother of
[29:57] anything so he says all right now you're
[30:01] one all right then
[30:09] what then would make up a marriage in
[30:14] scriptural terminologies as I said we've
[30:19] been taught that it's you know one
[30:22] brother one time told me he said you go
[30:25] up here at Hall County and check on it
[30:26] and see he said I ain't never been
[30:30] married but one time well that could be
[30:34] true but what about being engaged what
[30:40] about asking somebody to marry you what
[30:42] about those times you say I've just been
[30:48] married one time and have twenty wives
[30:51] cause you could ask 20 women to him like
[30:55] I said this morning about that fella
[30:56] saying that it was actually said here
[30:59] many years ago that you know the girl
[31:03] said I got a revelations been married
[31:09] four times she had a great revelation
[31:12] I guess each one of them was okay or
[31:15] either she'd been married three and then
[31:17] she got a revelation the fourth was
[31:18] really the one you know or something I
[31:19] don't know either way but it does sound
[31:23] silly don't it but let's just get down
[31:26] and think about it know if it's the
[31:33] ceremony at the altar then where are we
[31:40] if it's the consummation of the imagined
[31:44] us in the honeymoon you know my form of
[31:47] speaking it then what have you got what
[31:54] you see according to the Bible the Bible
[32:00] says by your words you be justified by
[32:03] your words you be condemned to have them
[32:05] written run off and stuck in a briefcase
[32:07] in there not to bring today but just in
[32:11] case it somebody needed it I have the
[32:14] vowels of going through Deuteronomy 22
[32:17] 23 and things that will try to get into
[32:21] probably in the next message if you vow
[32:22] vile and things like that you known how
[32:25] you're supposed to keep your word
[32:27] because see God takes your word and he
[32:32] just he just takes your word and what
[32:35] you say that's what he he does that's
[32:37] you know but what about it now marriage
[32:41] was first instituted in the Garden of
[32:43] Eden the Prophet said all right
[32:47] and then he had a ceremony then what
[32:56] about a marriage go ahead to number four
[33:00] everybody knows where you go and what
[33:02] you won't be bringing about Joseph that
[33:05] Mary but it proves the point Matthew
[33:09] 1:18 through 25 now the birth of Jesus
[33:12] Christ was on this wives when as his
[33:15] mother Mary was espoused a spouse the
[33:20] word espoused is 34:23 in the Strong's
[33:27] Concordance word of spouse it means to
[33:29] woo her and to ask her in a ask her in
[33:32] marriage it means to be promised in
[33:36] Mary's are to be betrothed that's what
[33:39] the word for spouse means alright now so
[33:42] they were engaged as we bring it and
[33:46] I'll get to the point in a minute with
[33:48] that we're in espoused to Joseph before
[33:52] they came together she was found with
[33:55] child of the Holy Ghost okay well they
[33:57] came together then Joseph her husband
[34:00] being a just man and not willing to make
[34:02] her a public example was minded to put
[34:05] her away privately because the law was
[34:08] and brother Branham I you know I didn't
[34:12] bring these any of them but you know how
[34:14] he was he said there Joseph was thinking
[34:18] I'm sitting this natural thinking he was
[34:21] thinking that Mary had told him you know
[34:23] said I'm I'm pregnant
[34:27] they were just engaged they said Mary
[34:32] said you've been out and she said no
[34:33] said the holy God
[34:34] he's over shattered me we'll see it was
[34:37] still hard for the human brain to
[34:39] comprehend so he said well I won't just
[34:44] put her away but privately he because if
[34:48] he went and told him they'd kill her
[34:50] that was the law so he said I won't put
[34:54] her away privately I'm gonna do this
[34:56] real easy you know and back out of it
[34:58] and and protect her all right but while
[35:04] he thought on these things behold the
[35:06] angel of the Lord appeared unto Him in a
[35:09] dream saying Joseph thou son of David
[35:10] fear not to take unto thee marry that
[35:12] woman
[35:16] we didn't say that they can be married
[35:20] thy wife and they were just espoused
[35:24] engaged for that which is conceived in
[35:28] her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall
[35:31] bring forth a son and thou shalt call
[35:32] his name Jesus for he shall save his
[35:34] people from their sins but arrested him
[35:37] Joseph thought she's trying to pull
[35:39] something over on me to keep from being
[35:43] killed as he said that's what he thought
[35:48] because I mean you know you watch this
[35:52] coming to you I'm gonna have a baby and
[35:54] it's the Holy Ghost
[35:57] you're gonna think a little bit so God
[36:00] used even a secondary way he never used
[36:03] a prophet he'd never use different
[36:04] things he used a dream so he comes to
[36:10] Joseph in a dream he said fear not to
[36:13] take unto thee Mary thy wife explains
[36:18] what it was going to be and everything
[36:20] Dean behold a virgin shall be with child
[36:24] and shall bring forth a son and I shall
[36:26] call his name Emmanuel which being
[36:28] interpreted is God with us then Joseph
[36:30] being raised from sleep did as the angel
[36:33] of the Lord had bidden him and took unto
[36:35] him his wife now
[36:42] look the next verse and knew her not
[36:45] till she had brought forth the first one
[36:47] firstborn son you were not see we know
[36:50] what that means so it's not going to the
[36:56] honeymoon that makes you married you
[36:59] know it's not that what is it
[37:05] what made Joseph and Mary married
[37:12] because Joseph had asked her and she had
[37:17] accepted that made him married all right
[37:24] now see that's the point that I'm
[37:28] driving at the word engaged he's not
[37:37] used but one time in the Bible all right
[37:40] go ahead and put it up we can read it
[37:42] Jeremiah 30 and 21 and their noble shall
[37:50] be of them be of themselves and their
[37:52] governors will proceed from the midst of
[37:54] them and I will called him to draw near
[37:56] and he shall approach unto me or who is
[37:59] that that engaged his heart to approach
[38:03] them to me saith the Lord that's the
[38:04] only time the word engaged is used in
[38:06] the Bible that word engaged is to be
[38:13] it's the only time you use its 6148 it
[38:17] means to pledge or to exchange see so
[38:23] this person here says God is saying
[38:28] about him that he has pledged within his
[38:30] heart as I said we'll get to the vial
[38:34] maybe next weekend
[38:36] when you make a vial God takes your word
[38:40] if you don't keep that you got a problem
[38:43] not well go ahead we'll read this
[38:47] scripture where did everybody make sure
[38:48] it is right Matthew 12:36
[38:52] what I say unto you that every idle word
[38:55] that men shall speak they shall give an
[38:57] account thereof in the day of judgment
[38:59] or by thy words thou shalt be justified
[39:01] and by thy words thou shalt be condemned
[39:05] right word you be justified words you'll
[39:10] be condemned
[39:11] okay now brother Branham we asking you
[39:15] the Bible speaks of an engagement or in
[39:18] being espoused and calls it wife and yet
[39:24] they hadn't lived together but they were
[39:27] engaged espoused now brother Branham
[39:31] what's your thoughts about it okay go to
[39:33] number seven and he explains from
[39:38] invisible Union paragraph 83 through 86
[39:41] we've just read that the other day but
[39:43] the main point is what I want on
[39:44] paragraph 86 Joseph's fear not taken to
[39:48] the murid iy for that which is conceived
[39:50] in her you know the Holy Ghost
[39:52] he was minded to put her away privately
[39:55] see after he'd already engaged to her
[39:58] when you're engaged to her as far as God
[40:01] is concerned you're married to her now
[40:09] he said well can we go live together no
[40:12] cuz that's immoral money you're not
[40:20] supposed to do that until you get the
[40:22] paperwork as far as God is concerned
[40:26] you're married
[40:30] but yet you got to finish the wedding up
[40:32] to do that because if you need them I'll
[40:34] be glad to find it I think I've got one
[40:36] in here but anyhow the Prophet said the
[40:39] law gives your right to live together
[40:41] where you won't be common-law but said
[40:44] you're married when you're engaged
[40:47] so now boys and girls you they're too
[40:51] young think about it if a boy asks a
[40:58] girl to marry him I'll read it in a
[41:00] minute in good favor in other words what
[41:02] he's saying what it would mean in good
[41:03] favor in other words both of them sound
[41:05] of mine both of them at a point both of
[41:07] them understanding it ain't some 20 year
[41:11] old guy that's a 12 year old girl to
[41:14] marry him and the 12 year old girls yes
[41:18] I'll marry you
[41:20] she ain't got enough sense to know what
[41:22] the word married yes some of them 80
[41:26] years old they got that much sense
[41:28] either but what about it if it's in good
[41:36] favor the Prophet said so what's he
[41:39] saying if you ask a girl to marry you
[41:43] and she does not accept that's not a
[41:45] wedding everybody agreed on a wedding is
[41:50] a binding agreement between two people
[41:53] an engagement is that binding agreement
[41:57] of verbally asking and accepting you
[42:02] know you know so then it's an engagement
[42:06] in it when a boy asks a girl and she in
[42:10] her right mind and understanding is yes
[42:15] then they're married either one of them
[42:22] break that they better have just reasons
[42:26] for it but if not they're gonna have to
[42:29] answer to God but understand me now what
[42:33] I'm saying the boy asked a girl to marry
[42:36] him and he does marry the boy asked the
[42:41] girl to marry
[42:43] she doesn't accept that's no wedding put
[42:48] that down and just think about it that's
[42:49] not a wedding it's when she accepts that
[42:52] proposal and say I love the Prophet in
[42:58] the way he does a lot of things God he
[42:59] leaves sometimes things for you to
[43:01] dangle over you remember the armored
[43:03] meatpacking company the girl that you
[43:06] know the little markswoman girl and he
[43:11] said I'll come back and get you in a
[43:12] year now I had to go by those words for
[43:16] a long time then he'd say he'd come back
[43:18] it's gonna really never looked it up I
[43:20] finally looked it up one day and it said
[43:22] because they were engaged he just didn't
[43:29] say I'll come back to your kitchen she's
[43:30] no they were engaged
[43:32] that's what's your prophet said sister
[43:36] boys and girls don't go out and just ask
[43:38] somebody to marry kids even you young
[43:41] kids don't don't play with those games
[43:42] you know I mean don't don't go around
[43:47] and asking a girl will you marry me or
[43:49] or this out of the other you know boys
[43:51] don't do that and we're in a bad age
[43:56] because now the girls are nesting the
[43:58] boys that is bad but get what I'm saying
[44:07] now when two people in honest agreement
[44:11] you know
[44:16] they agree to get married as far as God
[44:19] is concerned they're married that's an
[44:23] engagement then we'll get on down to the
[44:27] invisible union one of these days and
[44:30] we'll talk about how they are engaged to
[44:32] God and then we're married and all kind
[44:35] of things but think about it the Prophet
[44:42] said if you're engaged to her as far as
[44:44] God is concerned you're married to her
[44:50] shouldn't be any problem then go ahead
[44:52] with number eight let's see this is a
[44:54] long reading this is paragraph 193
[45:00] through 195 or so it goes on down yeah
[45:04] questions an answer is real 264 823 the
[45:09] evening service the question brother
[45:12] branham what is the meaning of an
[45:13] annulment are people too free to marry
[45:16] or is this just another word for divorce
[45:20] you know annulment right some people
[45:25] would say an annulment is not a divorce
[45:27] you know you're not doing annulment
[45:30] would be another word it is another word
[45:31] in the English but now to bring it back
[45:33] to where that you'll click it in brother
[45:36] Branham and father of the girl that
[45:40] Billy Paul married they had two wedding
[45:46] annulled did that eradicate the wedding
[45:51] did that eradicate their vows no because
[45:56] brother Branham refused to marry joseph
[45:58] de los how many the paul nearly paul
[46:06] wouldn't marry it all right so there was
[46:11] something wrong then wouldn't he he said
[46:15] Billy Paul or nobody the falsity of
[46:16] married no no no but it's not to just
[46:19] say well that done away with it no
[46:22] that's just other words you use in a
[46:23] court of law
[46:25] so what did he say sure there was
[46:27] married as long as you take that vowel
[46:29] they're married long as they take that
[46:31] Val there man just like a boy if a boy
[46:34] promises a girl to marry her under good
[46:36] faith no that's really meaning it's
[46:39] sincere and she answers back sincerely
[46:45] he's obligated to that girl he's just as
[46:49] good as mad as married her the only
[46:52] thing the law does is gives you a Bill
[46:54] of Rights to live together to keep from
[46:57] being common-law husband and wife but
[47:00] when a man tells a woman I will marry
[47:02] you honey I will take you for my wife
[47:05] will you take he's married your vow is
[47:08] sacred that's what marries you anyhow
[47:11] there's not no preacher can marry you no
[47:15] magistrate no nothing else it's your own
[47:18] vow to God and to this man when you
[47:22] promise you are married you promise well
[47:27] you were to be justified by your words
[47:29] you'll be condemned all right you said
[47:32] well we won't Bible for that that's what
[47:35] they said to him Joseph her husband
[47:39] being a just man her espoused husband
[47:41] already called her husband Joseph her
[47:46] husband being a just man was mindedly to
[47:49] put her away privately on this white
[47:51] privately on this wise but before they
[47:54] came together she was found with a child
[47:56] of the Holy Ghost he and the angel of
[47:58] the Lord appeared unto him in a dream
[48:00] and saying Joseph thou son of David
[48:02] you're not taken to the Mary that wife
[48:04] already married he'd already promised
[48:08] her
[48:08] what's your vows okay and all that
[48:12] little lady if you promise to marry that
[48:14] boy you're obligated to do it if you
[48:17] marry another after that obligation you
[48:20] will from now on anyhow he's got it
[48:24] blunt right don't you know it now you'll
[48:28] be living in adultery notice the same
[48:31] thing to a boy promising to marry woman
[48:34] what's that in a minute
[48:36] now let's cooling down don't you make
[48:39] your vow to anybody unless you mean to
[48:42] stick with it
[48:43] remember there's no Bible fart Joseph
[48:47] promised to marry Mary and God said that
[48:50] that was and watch him read the Old
[48:55] Testament laws on that now wake up click
[48:59] yourself and listen for a second on this
[49:01] one remember the Old Testament laws you
[49:05] had polygamy illegal look how close it
[49:09] gets all right everybody with me read
[49:14] the Old Testament laws on that see the
[49:16] Old Testament law if you promise to
[49:18] marry a woman and you married another
[49:25] member under polygamy that's legal is it
[49:33] clicking and you married another one you
[49:39] was committing adultery
[49:47] when the polygamy allowed happening
[49:48] why'd you want right but it's according
[49:51] to how you get them that was the whole
[49:53] point of the morning service
[50:04] he was committing adultery and it throws
[50:06] you out of the camp now he's on that Old
[50:10] Testament yes sir you have to keep your
[50:17] vows when you promise a woman that she's
[50:21] a sacred little vessel and that's to
[50:24] bring life into the world again so when
[50:27] you promise her you must marry her now
[50:31] under polygamy under polygamy
[50:36] if you promised a girl to marry her and
[50:39] didn't marry her you go marry another
[50:42] one you're living in adultery do you
[50:51] understand that
[50:56] me all right
[50:59] if you promise her to marry her
[51:02] he's supposed to get married to her now
[51:05] next week you might marry another one
[51:08] that was under the law right if you
[51:12] promise to marry her and you bypass her
[51:15] and go get you number two or number 90
[51:17] yeah you committed adultery and you're
[51:26] put out of the camp
[51:31] so polygamy wasn't just I just marry
[51:34] anybody
[51:36] just give me a wife under polygamy you
[51:43] were not allowed to marry now are we
[51:47] backing up to the morning message under
[51:50] polygamy you were only a Mary allowed to
[51:53] marry a virgin nobody any word I want
[51:58] the Bible now don't play grounds with me
[52:00] I know what God one time told a prophet
[52:03] to go marry a prostitute and have
[52:05] children by my know Bible so don't come
[52:08] out something like that that was God
[52:11] telling the Prophet you can't explain
[52:12] that knock ain't either because that was
[52:17] God telling him what to do what you see
[52:21] no matter what a man or a woman either
[52:23] woman it's supposed to marry a virgin
[52:27] well what about David married Abigail
[52:29] Abigail husband was dead and if Abigail
[52:34] was a virgin when she married the guy
[52:36] that was called a fool that was what his
[52:38] name meant that her son he died and she
[52:43] married David she's still a virgin you
[52:48] got to get it right there's no gray
[52:53] areas right either right or wrong so
[53:01] under the law
[53:01] now you're brought your prophet is
[53:03] explaining said to read the Old
[53:06] Testament laws
[53:09] that if you promise to marry a girl and
[53:13] you didn't marry her and went married
[53:14] another he said you're living in
[53:15] adultery I'm like I'm sad now if he kept
[53:20] his promise and made the girl
[53:22] two weeks later he could married another
[53:25] one you know and that would have been
[53:28] alright long as she was a virgin but if
[53:33] you buy pies that when it won't keep you
[53:34] promise okay
[53:41] so Jesus is right in there by your words
[53:49] you'll be justified and by your words
[53:52] you'll be condemned gotta be done right
[53:59] everything's got to be in order if not
[54:07] it throws you clean out of the camp now
[54:12] your prophet was straight about the
[54:14] scriptures right he didn't twist
[54:17] scriptures brother down I don't give it
[54:21] a whole four nobody that's exactly the
[54:24] truth none of us have any hopes it's not
[54:31] how goody-goody you've been all your
[54:33] life and your got not going to die and
[54:40] go to hell because of polygamy you're
[54:46] gonna die and go to hell for unbelief
[54:51] the polygamy is wrong today cuz you
[54:53] don't need it to talk no more you're in
[54:57] the answer time and if you none at the
[54:59] top you don't have another time to go to
[55:01] you are the finishings finality
[55:06] Ben and his wife that's why he said go
[55:09] home with your wife
[55:14] people went dart with three or four
[55:16] wives for four husbands if it was
[55:18] revealed to him that day they went home
[55:20] with one I've told you when Paul came to
[55:25] the law of grace imagine divorce he
[55:28] wound up with polygamy situations he was
[55:30] facing what about a person coming up
[55:32] want to be a Christian didn't they say
[55:37] Paul what can I do
[55:39] I've got 10 wives that's all I can say
[55:46] is if you take the scripture put it
[55:47] together and what are you gonna come up
[55:49] with my thoughts is what Paul would tell
[55:53] him take one of them women that's your
[55:55] first one you're married when you're
[55:58] married first in other words you're true
[56:00] to that one point you started off right
[56:02] bigger and go home with her that's your
[56:05] wife but don't you live with your mother
[56:08] none because we're making things right
[56:14] but I'm straight - Paul would tell him
[56:17] cuz I would you make sure they are four
[56:21] supplied financially not just throw them
[56:25] out the door you know just get out of
[56:26] here you're not gonna my no that's his
[56:28] children God don't play games God's true
[56:36] we get any straight he's got a word to
[56:38] keep we don't keep that word what are we
[56:44] gonna do now with all of us in the bad
[56:49] shape me where I live house ever gonna
[56:51] be a rapture but you know there is a
[56:59] grace
[57:04] but you know the way I preach it is not
[57:06] only just a grace about our natural
[57:08] things our old husband denominational
[57:12] husband got to be dead not divorced
[57:19] mark and I were talking coming back now
[57:23] to hunting land yesterday you can take
[57:28] every doctrine and they all stem from
[57:31] one thing the two souls then it went to
[57:42] two Lords
[57:45] female Holy Ghost male Holy Ghost then
[57:49] it went to River Jordan doctrine and
[57:56] each one of them is making God into a
[57:59] trinity again they just come out of the
[58:08] open under the River Jordan doctrine
[58:11] what they were really saying when I
[58:13] loves the same doctrine you got two
[58:17] Sloane's you got two gods you got to
[58:19] have them you got two lords that's two
[58:21] gods you got a male Holy Ghost the
[58:25] female Holy Ghost you got two Holy Ghost
[58:29] you've got Jesus not being God through
[58:32] the river Jordan you got identically the
[58:34] same doctrine if they come up cut in
[58:36] rogue landed the first not seeing
[58:38] counselor 325 AD go home and read it
[58:43] that was the doctrine they were trying
[58:44] to get an inroad it's like I've told
[58:48] brother Mark I can make the statement of
[58:50] people just frown at me at 325 AD reads
[58:57] you're not seeing counsel they declared
[59:00] that that doctrine of Jesus being in
[59:03] light a different substance was wrong
[59:05] that he was very God that's your first
[59:08] not seeing counselor
[59:10] that's you're not seeing Creed
[59:15] because it could not get no inroad
[59:18] desire took us 606 to bring it up go
[59:21] home and read it on you encyclopedia but
[59:24] 325 they didn't read what it says see
[59:30] the men there was trying to get that
[59:31] doctrine that Jesus was another
[59:33] substance and not the substance of God
[59:39] and that's identically what you're
[59:41] saying today and yet people are always
[59:45] wonderful I just love that you know they
[59:49] do sales some truth in other words you
[59:54] just want to be a just a little
[59:55] bit sorry you just want to run around a
[1:00:04] little bit I think it's time to stop it
[1:00:09] and just get it down in a plain language
[1:00:12] forget it or golden you don't do
[1:00:14] whatever but you see I'm not popular
[1:00:20] well you don't understand that bro you
[1:00:24] don't understand things no I don't I
[1:00:27] don't understand how anybody could say
[1:00:30] that Jesus wasn't almighty god but to
[1:00:36] show you their Trinitarian you know what
[1:00:37] the brothers say it and we heard he
[1:00:39] wasn't saying he said you ain't nothing
[1:00:41] but a bunch of one this is bleak like
[1:00:42] y'all believe you believe Jesus was God
[1:00:47] now you just won this well if he
[1:00:51] believes this - he's doing this
[1:00:57] he's a trinitarian then what is he god
[1:01:03] what is that gonna change anybody no but
[1:01:07] it's to warn you do not let that jump
[1:01:11] get into your mind so all I'm doing with
[1:01:14] it I don't never hear it you're around
[1:01:17] sometimes
[1:01:18] you listen you just pay attention to
[1:01:20] what you're hearing anything that
[1:01:25] declares that Jesus Christ was not
[1:01:27] Almighty God the Bible says is
[1:01:31] anti-christ now that's what the
[1:01:33] scripture said I don't have to say it
[1:01:37] either deny that Jesus is a crisis what
[1:01:39] Antichrist what you see Church we play
[1:01:45] around with those little ideas we'll get
[1:01:47] back to that but get down to a point you
[1:01:50] say well what is I'm reading then
[1:01:52] brother there it's when you ask somebody
[1:01:54] to marry you and they accept you the
[1:02:03] only thing would annihilate that would
[1:02:05] be the woman to go off some way to do
[1:02:07] something wrong but there's no grounds
[1:02:14] whatsoever for her to be able to be
[1:02:16] engaged again unless that boy dies yeah
[1:02:23] but that's just too hard you don't leave
[1:02:26] us any grace not only no disgrace it's
[1:02:36] either God is not God the word is either
[1:02:42] God's words not God's words it is not
[1:02:44] let's quit go home and forget it
[1:02:51] we're gonna believe it it's like I said
[1:02:55] even your prophet covered under polygamy
[1:03:01] if you ask that girl to marry her and
[1:03:03] you don't marry you go marry another he
[1:03:05] said you're living in adultery and put
[1:03:08] out the camp don't fit surely wasn't
[1:03:14] right under polygamy which surely
[1:03:16] wouldn't have nowhere else to be right
[1:03:18] you ask that girl to marry you and she
[1:03:21] accepts you're married both of you
[1:03:24] married the only grounds that you have a
[1:03:29] breaking that or that engagement is for
[1:03:33] her to go out and do something wrong
[1:03:36] take another man
[1:03:40] yeah you say if he went out and got
[1:03:45] engaged to somebody else would that free
[1:03:49] her to marry no you can't free her to
[1:03:53] marry death death is the only thing that
[1:04:00] frees the woman to remarry now try to be
[1:04:09] nice and honest about it I know somebody
[1:04:12] in this message that her husband
[1:04:14] disappeared well she waited
[1:04:16] I don't think eight ten years or
[1:04:18] something him no she had to law to try
[1:04:23] to find him done everything she could
[1:04:26] and they allow law finally declared him
[1:04:29] legally dead well you know what I didn't
[1:04:33] have no problem for that you said well
[1:04:36] you don't know where he wrote or not but
[1:04:38] you don't know where he was or not
[1:04:39] either okay the law declared him legally
[1:04:44] dead she wasn't married again
[1:04:48] eyewitness had nothing this is straight
[1:04:56] listen to what he said now we have seen
[1:04:58] his star in the east and come to worship
[1:05:00] Him
[1:05:00] preached in 1963 12 16 paragraph 65 into
[1:05:06] 66 and he's coming down explaining about
[1:05:10] Christ and Joseph by dream and the Bible
[1:05:13] says you know Joseph was a good man and
[1:05:15] all he was a spouse to Mary I'd like to
[1:05:18] pass this on before we go further
[1:05:21] espousing in the East was the same as
[1:05:25] marriage his betrothed all as soon as
[1:05:31] they as they were a spouse they were
[1:05:33] married when that sacred vow between
[1:05:37] them was taken read Deuteronomy 22 23
[1:05:42] now we'll get to that and you know later
[1:05:45] in the message on the vowels and you'll
[1:05:48] find out that when this woman and man
[1:05:51] agreed
[1:05:52] married yet they did not take the vials
[1:05:55] four months later
[1:05:56] now you understand it another word they
[1:05:59] didn't go down to the preacher didn't go
[1:06:00] through the vowels they didn't have the
[1:06:02] ceremony till much later if they even
[1:06:06] broke that vow they were guilty of
[1:06:09] adultery now watch him is he talking
[1:06:16] about just the man or the woman who's he
[1:06:18] talking matter he's on about everybody
[1:06:20] is he tying that together with the other
[1:06:22] is God doing it if they even broke that
[1:06:25] vinyl they were guilty of adultery
[1:06:26] that's right when they were a spouse
[1:06:28] they were just the same as marriage the
[1:06:31] law had not given them rights to live
[1:06:34] together a husband and wife yet but
[1:06:36] before God when they promised one
[1:06:38] another their words were sealed in God's
[1:06:41] kingdom and to break that was just
[1:06:44] committing adultery and now Joseph was a
[1:06:47] spouse to marry now look where Joseph
[1:06:52] was standing do you understand if Mary's
[1:06:57] right she's still virgin
[1:07:01] she hadn't done anything wrong right if
[1:07:07] she was not a virgin he had a right to
[1:07:10] put her away have her killed Mary was
[1:07:13] still a virgin
[1:07:15] little brown said she had to be virgin
[1:07:17] spoken words regional see she had to be
[1:07:19] virgin in mind and mm-hmm
[1:07:25] you ever thought about how God does
[1:07:27] things why didn't he just create in a
[1:07:33] little old girl with our name Mary that
[1:07:35] wouldn't engage to nobody you know just
[1:07:38] a young girl when engaged to nobody
[1:07:41] look how God knows how things has to be
[1:07:46] done to keep it right and she come up
[1:07:49] claiming I've got a baby from the Lord
[1:07:50] oh yeah they just took her out and
[1:07:53] killed her he didn't do it that way did
[1:07:57] he he went down to a girl that was
[1:08:00] engaged espoused to a husband
[1:08:04] to where the husband could protect her
[1:08:07] because I said a moment ago if Joseph
[1:08:10] had to protect her they too killed her
[1:08:11] that was the law okay so look how he
[1:08:17] does times their words were sealed in
[1:08:23] God's kingdom and the break that was
[1:08:25] just committing adultery and now Joseph
[1:08:27] was a spouse to marry if Minister
[1:08:30] brothers if you'd study that right good
[1:08:32] it's it clear you up on this marriage
[1:08:35] and divorce case that's so so hard and
[1:08:38] different amongst the people today and
[1:08:40] notice Joseph her husband being a just
[1:08:41] man see now we find out that this could
[1:08:44] not be broken you can't break that vowel
[1:08:50] if you do you're committing adultery
[1:08:58] what about it
[1:09:03] how many times did somebody ask you to
[1:09:05] marry and you said yes and then you
[1:09:07] didn't food that didn't go through boys
[1:09:10] how many girls did you ask to marry I'm
[1:09:12] talking about me in sitting here you
[1:09:13] know how many times did you ever ask
[1:09:15] anybody to marry you and didn't keep
[1:09:18] your word so you remember what I said
[1:09:24] this morning or what ago or some time
[1:09:26] about it that the brother said you can
[1:09:28] go to the courthouse and see I ain't
[1:09:29] never been married but one time but what
[1:09:34] about God's kingdom it's written in
[1:09:40] God's kingdom when you asked that girl
[1:09:42] to marry you and she accepts you
[1:09:45] I said God's kingdom why would you want
[1:09:52] to break something like that what about
[1:09:59] it it's a serious matter it's not a play
[1:10:03] time or you know something that we just
[1:10:07] play around with it we'll get back next
[1:10:12] weekend the Lord willing on the vial or
[1:10:14] some cover a few things how did it take
[1:10:15] too long you see you can always try to
[1:10:20] find a loophole right
[1:10:26] you go down and you get a law and you
[1:10:28] get it into law before the law is voted
[1:10:32] into law and the governor or ever who
[1:10:35] signs it into law before it's signed
[1:10:38] into law somebody's done got it figured
[1:10:40] out how to be a loophole in the things
[1:10:43] right well isn't that kind of the way it
[1:10:50] is in the gospel the people are always
[1:10:54] trying to find a loophole then like I
[1:11:01] was trying to say this morning see
[1:11:03] somebody come along and say well you
[1:11:06] know in my husband's divorced is anyway
[1:11:09] I get married again no but why would you
[1:11:11] want to if you couldn't make it on the
[1:11:15] first one 842 ain't go away why not did
[1:11:27] you say well God you be my husband and
[1:11:30] you you protect me and take care of me
[1:11:34] you be my lord let me put my life to you
[1:11:38] is that not what Paul says that when
[1:11:41] some men are what made eunuchs by man he
[1:11:55] said some are born eunuchs let's just
[1:11:59] one something happen went wrong but he
[1:12:04] said some make themselves eunuchs for
[1:12:06] the gospel and Paul said I've got every
[1:12:11] right to get married he said it won't
[1:12:16] and when did he go on to explain he said
[1:12:19] because yelling marry the married thing
[1:12:23] you know is what current you know I have
[1:12:27] to be concerned with my family my wife
[1:12:31] in the house and the cars and the taking

[1:14:17] married what I'm not made for that I'm
[1:14:20] not and it's not on account of a lot of
[1:14:22] things you'd be laughing about I'm just
[1:14:23] not made for those line my door in my
[1:14:27] study is never closed my door back door

[1:14:48] study used to be right there where the
[1:14:50] play kids us the the
[1:14:52] then we're all their choices then well
[1:14:57] that's where I set them studied and I
[1:15:05] don't mean it wrong I know everybody's
[1:15:06] not made that way but you know you
[1:15:11] called some people how did certain time
[1:15:13] drew I can't interfere because he's
[1:15:15] studying what's honorable not you don't
[1:15:21] never get that answer when you call my
[1:15:22] house she might say he's in the study

[1:15:36] problem but you understand a single
[1:15:44] person this dick can dedicate their
[1:15:46] whole life to God say why would you want
[1:15:54] to get married again to some sorry slob
[1:15:55] because you get a sorry slap to start
[1:15:57] with why do you want another sorry stop
[1:16:05] then you wind up later saying I wish
[1:16:08] hadn't got to slob
[1:16:19] do you understand marriage and divorce
[1:16:25] is a very serious matter a very serious
[1:16:28] thing its life then we say this because
[1:16:35] I know you ain't gonna like it but it's
[1:16:37] true there's a lot of men you're older
[1:16:39] than their wives I hope to god we don't
[1:16:42] live 40 more years because if we do some
[1:16:46] of you gonna be pushing your old man
[1:16:48] down the aisle to the church because
[1:16:51] you're a whole lot younger than he is
[1:16:53] that was your choice of marrying like
[1:16:55] that not mine
[1:16:57] and I'm not saying anything wrong with
[1:16:59] it Joseph was an old man married and had
[1:17:01] kids married married I'm not saying
[1:17:04] nothing that's just true I'm just
[1:17:06] telling you like it is you're looking
[1:17:08] for a wonderful time one of these days
[1:17:11] we'll get to live on the old man's money
[1:17:13] when he retires you push him in a
[1:17:16] wheelchair come on better life than it
[1:17:28] is to cry that's what mother would be
[1:17:34] said something one day about dog was
[1:17:36] running the deer off his land we're not
[1:17:38] know about I said a better life that is
[1:17:44] to cry life is a very serious matter so
[1:17:52] we can have fun and we can be jolly you
[1:17:55] know and talk about things and it be
[1:17:56] true but yet not be derogatory and
[1:17:59] aggravating yeah we're supposed to marry
[1:18:04] as I said this morning in Lourdes they
[1:18:07] don't matter if the woman's 15 and the
[1:18:09] boy to 80 if you're married in the Lord

[1:18:26] listen Church we go out and we didn't
[1:18:30] know right we didn't know you know some
[1:18:35] of you younger ones or some of you in
[1:18:36] other churches and things it in this
[1:18:38] message you know yourself they don't
[1:18:39] teach this very much do you ever hear it
[1:18:42] taught where you used to go to church
[1:18:45] much on marriage and divorce I'm really
[1:18:47] what it is
[1:18:49] no that fraid to see the afraid to go
[1:18:51] run them off because I mean I have to be
[1:18:56] blown out to tell you hey you got
[1:19:00] problems you tell me got problem they're
[1:19:04] gonna leave now let's have less problems
[1:19:11] let's get me a job and go to work right
[1:19:13] now less problems
[1:19:15] I'm not worried about running anybody
[1:19:17] off I don't want to run nobody off
[1:19:20] heaven help now you think I do
[1:19:21] I know what and what do you think about
[1:19:23] me you think I'm trying my best run
[1:19:25] y'all know I'm trying my best to get you
[1:19:27] and I saved your to save marriage and
[1:19:34] divorce or whether it be just natural
[1:19:35] salvation that we need or whether it
[1:19:38] just be husband and wife living together
[1:19:40] I've even been some blunt way to tell
[1:19:43] you if you forgive that woman or to give
[1:19:45] that man forgive them you know when
[1:19:46] they've done something wrong and you
[1:19:48] bring that up again you're a hypocrite
[1:19:50] that's as much as I can say then you
[1:19:55] pout up and well you ain't like my first
[1:19:58] husband or my first wife now what kind
[1:20:04] of a situation is life like that I'd
[1:20:08] rather have two jobs and undies single
[1:20:16] and you know you know what I'm saying is
[1:20:20] true and what I'm fixing to say you will
[1:20:21] agree with it
[1:20:23] 90% of the men and women of this message
[1:20:26] is not going to live together when
[1:20:28] they've had a problem and not bring it
[1:20:30] up in some way or another you know what
[1:20:34] I mean
[1:20:36] you're going to say well that was the
[1:20:41] way your first wife treated you ain't
[1:20:42] the way I treat you
[1:20:44] you're gonna bring up stuff because you
[1:20:47] just can't keep it from sister Trudy
[1:20:53] remembers what I've told her years ago
[1:20:57] she's driving down here driving five
[1:20:58] hours to come to church and then driving
[1:21:01] five hours to get back home to get home
[1:21:03] at 10 o'clock at night I told her from
[1:21:07] this pulpit pointing to her and another
[1:21:08] sister I said if you go home tonight in
[1:21:10] your hugs wouldn't wants to go get
[1:21:11] something to eat I'm tired I've been
[1:21:14] serving as our dog day I'm not going
[1:21:18] with you
[1:21:21] you're not gonna win them that away
[1:21:26] right you're gonna win them by being the
[1:21:31] true husband and the true wife if you
[1:21:35] want to win your wife or you want to win
[1:21:36] your husband to the way you believe then
[1:21:39] live before them what's supposed to be
[1:21:41] what you believe hey we're gonna have
[1:21:46] trouble are we gonna I'll do it no car

[1:22:00] Ron say he said I can't hear you words
[1:22:04] because of your life

[1:22:39] legal right and I would have said amen
[1:22:42] brother be there yet he's here that
[1:22:49] means a lot to me it means you want to
[1:22:52] hear and so might like meaning that
[1:22:56] doesn't mean a lot because there's not a
[1:23:00] lot of people maybe it wants to hear but

[1:23:06] say and do and you're gonna have your
[1:23:09] part you're gonna have to face that part
[1:23:14] but you can't go there and say I didn't
[1:23:17] hear it I haven't been told you know
[1:23:21] that 90% of the message people churches

[1:26:09] I ain't going back I don't even go keep
[1:26:12] nothing further store cuz you go in and
[1:26:16] everybody Obama oh who it over that you
[1:26:19] know this is that not problem you know
[1:26:21] they're always talking you know why
[1:26:26] don't we fool with that junk now if
[1:26:29] they're gonna talk about the Lord I'll
[1:26:30] be there when I walk in the Lord a
[1:26:35] mission he goes on vacation when I go to
[1:26:38] give or go to any mansion
[1:26:41] cuz I'm one of them nuts yeah but listen
[1:26:46] Church seriousness we'll get to it on
[1:26:51] the invisible Union when we get a chance
[1:26:52] to and God asks you to marry him accept
[1:26:57] him as your Savior and you accept it
[1:27:01] that might just be justification to chop
[1:27:05] off you PI sins that may just be the
[1:27:09] beginning of your Christian journey but
[1:27:13] God counts it is finished and sees no
[1:27:17] problems and no trouble along the road
[1:27:21] he just comes down and gives you the new
[1:27:25] birth
[1:27:28] we don't have to wait to get to heaven
[1:27:30] to be married no but we found out to it
[1:27:32] there will be a marriage in heaven the
[1:27:34] Prophet says it but we're already
[1:27:37] married to him now because we're engaged
[1:27:40] we're married what about it but Stan the
[1:27:45] Coen brothers what is a wedding it's an
[1:27:51] engagement then it goes through stages
[1:27:56] just like your Christian journey goes
[1:27:59] through stages of justification
[1:28:00] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:28:03] Holy Ghost to bring in the new birth
[1:28:05] your marriage goes through stages of
[1:28:08] what the asking accepting planning of
[1:28:13] the wedding getting everything ready and
[1:28:16] going all the way through and one day go
[1:28:19] to the altar and you know speak and do
[1:28:24] that's why they asked brother Branham
[1:28:26] said we said we were married by justice
[1:28:29] of the peace many years ago and said
[1:28:31] brother Brennan was we married he said
[1:28:32] yes because he was married by your vows
[1:28:34] and I and said she was married but says
[1:28:38] you ought to be married in a church well
[1:28:42] that's why we've had here many times
[1:28:44] over the years
[1:28:45] a marriage renewal and in that marriage
[1:28:51] renewal I don't single out and say you
[1:28:54] and you I you and you you and y'all can
[1:28:57] come up and we'll have a marriage know
[1:29:01] it's open for the church to come and say
[1:29:08] let's have a wedding is that wrong
[1:29:12] without you show it to men it's all
[1:29:13] right this is church we got just not
[1:29:17] your church is what we believe
[1:29:24] yeah but that couple stood up there and
[1:29:26] I know they had problems and you stand
[1:29:30] back there with a whole lot of them yeah
[1:29:33] what's the difference
[1:29:39] someone once said are we gonna get the
[1:29:41] right husband when we get over the IROC
[1:29:42] they're not married I don't know nothing
[1:29:45] about that I don't think it's gonna be a
[1:29:48] juggling of the books when you get
[1:29:50] turtle you got away you'll help me be
[1:29:52] home later he was married to three other
[1:29:54] women he'll be fine you get him that's
[1:29:56] not silly that's what a lot of people
[1:29:58] thinks yeah but we gotta have another
[1:30:04] half what the problem with a lot of
[1:30:09] people leaves they got another half and
[1:30:10] another half in another having another
[1:30:11] having another I haven't enough right
[1:30:13] they got a lot of hives a lot it equals
[1:30:17] out to be a few holes
[1:30:21] listen church girl's fat boy says will
[1:30:27] you marry me don't you answer him we'll
[1:30:30] get to it in the scripture that if you
[1:30:32] do something as a young girl and it's
[1:30:34] too young and ever time there's things
[1:30:36] that your daddy can take care of but it
[1:30:39] not for just any calls or any kind of
[1:30:41] sign
