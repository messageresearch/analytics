========================================

- ringing tones and interpretation well you ain't got a nice fish against those hand got these in the cup he said that's the last to give have you ever thought about wisdom Fame when he said knowledge healing healing miracles prophecy they're sick so and then the other ones come in there with you you go over those say what if you don't have speaking it know that any in it if you don't have the nine spiritual guess working now now keep ready to quote up there brother I've said you'd have to give an account as a church if you didn't have a name that's what we have to keep if we come to church with those and we don't get all taken care of you don't have to go to the altar that's going to do it but if you care that thing that we just keep getting working keep getting worse the wraps that you leave either better or worse service why because that's what judgment starts in house of God preacher says something and you might be saying that we're going somebody over there maybe you come today alright ain't no time this time okay it ain't your day ain't no fifteen minutes okay just sleep over it and wake up the national gun that's correct that child are you hindered sometimes you go here come back that's why that we try to reverse the house to God as much as we can there is times when you have to speak but brother Brown said they you know they hey brother I need to meet you outside that don't mean you stand in the car diction have a comfortable conversation when you can go outside and have it all right and you have to still with a lot of people they'll stop more top of somebody's day outside I mean wait five minutes if you can't wait five minutes you need to turn go back to the altar we can't wait a minute you know go go back that way right but he keeps order because remember brother Brown said the Holy Ghost is a very timid person you got to always remember that because remember you can grieve the Holy Spirit remember grieve not the Holy three of the gun brother Brown said that the Holy Ghost was well on a limb and sit there and wait for you to repent that I don't mean that now listen they don't mean that that's just an illustration that don't mean that if this is your Holy Ghost he goes over yonder and set somewhere no he just didn't pay today is a learning day I'm not going to give you any revelation you're gonna feel the worst you've ever felt in your life but when you take care of what you've just done I'll come back coughing Tommy basically that's what it did cuz you know what the whole dose is the person so he talks to you all right it's not a ghost it just flows through there no you the person he can't well well right right well it's that's one of it he's not in our spirit realm because the sins we have as Christians are in the spirit realm it's not in the soul you can't see them brother Brown said you can't send enough to be lost if you're born again so that inside man is so I mean he solid well you know why it's solid cuz he got no lesser person he's God [Music] jerk when it comes down to it [Music] at the end of the service my brother salmon spinach but yeah the segment is going on and he's still saying things that's the one we will pop up and they've got yeah well you know to me that part of the service right there what they need but yet all of this commotion is going on in women is that certainly strong it's distracting yeah I agree but you know that is though it's got to be the devil does that say no it's not god I'm doing that so and you know here we go we're human beings we've listened to an hour hour and 15 minute sermon we went through 30 minutes of limitary and that's when somebody to go to the bathroom that when all that you know let's stand to our feet yeah when you stand up yeah the copy agenda but as a human being just realized that you know if God's in that service you're staying there for a few more minutes just think I'm going to jump off you know just stand there for a little while longer you say well I'm about to fan well just stand there for a minute if it's a god you won't have to worry about it I have been in service and I'll be honest I've been in service when I'm drinking let's talking up there in the front and I need to go bad so back under so bad and I have to walk so far and that's like you said hold it now there's a couple times like that but now you got it you gods in it though ever go away and you want even when you come downstairs you'll you'll finally eat your lunch and then you'll go outside you go two hours later so let's happen to me several times yeah so just trust in God but you know God can help us more than we want to be helped you say well that's kind of free kind of frivolous god help me you don't have to well you know what Lane nothing there's nothing in the scripture that says now they had a few things I'm not gonna help y'all with no he said I'm a guard to heals all your diseases and that is a disease that's all that went to go and he'll help you through but really I'll have that happen if you'll just hang on a little bit and if God's working in the service you'll forget about it you're really well and you'll just being you and your enter into the worship service a little bit more mm-hmm yeah by a new and living way which is consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience now our heart would you like I said that very center realm you cannot stand in that center realm if you are born again if not it's the seat of sin but then what's they does if he moves out into that outer realm memory reason conscious of it listen in fact if your memory doesn't bother you you're just not human you're on drugs yeah you're lying thank you now I can go say it but thank you thank you you're lying to yourself mainly memory reason conscious of face imagination now look I'm using those the soda SAT but now remember what brother Dale was trying to get us to see that if we don't free the journey of a Christian but through justification sanctification something truly justified you're already glorified in God's eyes not yours he knows what are you going to go on with the baptism there's a lot of people get justified because remember you don't get justified by being in a message Church you can be standing out on the street corner and the Bible says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be safe and that's what brother Tim was getting back on with his people trying to get him believe crying oh look he's even taking he had some pictures of brother Branham that was on the wall behind the pulpit don't fall down he said when I want people to raise their hands he said Oh see Christ I don't want to see another way so and we have to leave took it all that down and he's trying to get the people to get back the way and that's what brother Graham says you know I've getting them to Christ we're getting up to an idea and he was telling them because of the denomination well now here we are 2020 all motion and are we doing the same thing let's just fill up a message Church let's just make sure you don't wear dress company don't wear pants them mean you don't and you don't and you don't any you get on the cross thank them all back then we didn't get bench so Lily we'll start right here somewhere how about right there no force a clean they stand laying yourself together as the manner of some is and so much more as the day approaches okay I don't just like brother Dale if you need time to church morning you did when you started a born-again Bible you Tuesday morning in India verb that's where I start alright 950 let's go do it hi dildo well the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the Lincoln never we're gonna miss kind of we didn't get down too far sunny but we'll back up just a little bit and finish this chapter but the law having a shadow good things to come and not the very image of the thing so always remember the law was a shadow of good things to come but not the very image so you can't take in the Old Testament like we talked before you cannot take and tight everything in the Old Testament simply because David was a murderer in the Old Testament he was an adulterer first a murderer and he tried to cover it up so you know what if that was today he wouldn't be not just guilty a murder he'd been guilty of capital murder because he tried to cover it up right bad yes it wouldn't be good and then you take all the other people you take brother Keith Reed now we're talking about Abraham the father of our faith who Paul said strong in faith never weak that's not what's written in the Bible from getting away his wife twice even if you type that giving his wife away twice he gave her away as Abram and then he gave her away as Abraham okay so even in his journey as he progressed he was still human and he was under the law and there was nothing inside of him there was no there was no there was a moral accomplice but it wasn't God so much taking over and living the life the way with Abraham living his life now he lived close enough to God but I'm telling you you look at Abraham Abraham didn't just giggle in his heart like Sarah did when God told Abraham he was going to have the baby he got on the ground the Bible says with his face of the ground and lack now to me that would be way worse than Sarah giggling in her heart Sam huh I mean that pleasure with my husband a little more time with other words that's been 97 years old and brother after God would kill her for that if it hadn't been for every minute okay so these things we don't understand so they have a shadow then you go then you got a guy telling the Prophet to go marry prostitute then she leaves him comes back maybe they have more coming is that you can't type that in the Bible but God typed it to help Israel you got to remember God topped it to help Israel and then the type we take is we don't see the shadow anymore we don't take the shadow as gospel we take the very image of the things what when Christ come but we'll talk about a little bit today Christ is the Anointed Messiah all right he was not in the Old Testament in a person all of the earth everybody got that because now he is in a person on the earth and people called a bride there was an Old Testament bride but it what he had to put them away and we've covered that many many times so but it had a shadow of good things to come but not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect I see you and I sure we have sins but we don't have sin okay we have sins we think things wrong we look at something maybe we shouldn't look I mean things are in front of us all the time we have to say God forgive me but now the things the back we don't go back to the bottom we back to them and we don't go back you know make your own laundry list whatever you smoking drinking gambling cousin running around all the things we'll see that's behind us because the perfections now inside of us because David I don't believe David with the new birth would have ever ever committed adultery with Bathsheba his his moral compass kind of got a little skewed when he in other words his his spirit realm took over to go get Bathsheba where God would control it more now I hope we don't have the problem with the baptism was all ago something one thing but he did have that problem and see that is an example of what God has done now in the New Testament he's come inside of us and it's not just a moral compass it's God living inside of us his his compass being lived up to us all right cook because that sacrifices didn't make them perfect that will come back last Sunday somebody comes up his ham I stole from my neighbor I want to offer this lamb will see that stealing nature was still in that guy he come back to next year he said oh I'm sorry I stole something else you know you just keep why because the sacrifice was just an offering to what to cover our to capo or cover what we're doing and even now we have that blood still on us for us and for us the little things we do as human beings but remember we better Bend of the throne we've entered boldly before the throne where they can't even go kicking down their door they make any touching come back from back-to-back-to-back for the same thing well they never never say it in the Bible because it even says here since Cain never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year so they offered them for the same thing year by year Mather comer they're into perfect Bela folks there's a lot of people that were thieves in the Old Testament that never did a sacrifice just like now there's people out here that are just rent center okay and there was people there not everybody in Israel walked up with a lamb just the ones that was trying to do better they were trying to live a good what we say Christian life they tried I'm reading it if you look I tell you what a healthy read first Chronicles and second it chronicles or writes down all the kings that were in Israel the ones that do good and once it did back the ones that did good God blessed that whole place the ones that did get bad dr. sacani told him he said as long as you keep me as your guide I'll bless you if you start going after these other gods you're gonna have trouble any would and I mean you see many times you looking Josiah was the king he was eight years old I know your own boy was a king but he did the right things and the eyes of God and when he turned 14 years old i Freedman yesterday when he turned 14 years old he had they said it had never the Passover had never been celebrated like he celebrated it that one year I mean the whole of Israel based on five thousands upon thousands of animals and God blessed Joseph from 8 years old to 50 something years ago beerain 40 something years and in Israel got killed in a battle but you have to remember you look at some of these has a cop different ones they'll start out good and then they'll turn to people or you know yeah just I'm saying journey with us right ain't God will bless those then what they keep God as their God okay but remember it's not Old Testament go back to them Ten Commandments or the you know doesn't don't because you got to get really real with some of this stuff but don't mean the Bible tells you don't wear wool with cotton you know all these things just and you know some of them are if some of them did Rome they shave their head or they would what they call it board their something they would call it they do something to do beer it's you yeah so I mean you know things like that you say well that's not it's still in the model but remember if we have an updated revelation that that that we don't have time to do them well the update of Revelation is we know that God down won't tell a prophet to go marry prostitute he won't tell you to go marry a prostitute he can't do that not with the blood of Jesus Christ being in you not just covering you alright so he's not going to tell you to go marry a prostitute but he told deliver that wasn't the back cut or somebody could Nick that was out there Hosea could go man prostitute now say that's totally against even the Old Testament but God told him to do it as an example right so in any battle it's not for us that free Israel that was not budge how did he change if you don't change but he's just not gonna tell anybody else to do it that way well in what you know he's never gonna tell someone else to do that okay he didn't change he didn't change he never told anybody else to do it that way again he just never said don't do it we just know not to do it he don't even say in the Old Testament don't marry prosecute you know what who was that Rosella brother Brown when I cross with you right here prostitute she married after she got converted she married and went out - fine so since you got married well brother Brown sure told she was a good Christian lady but stuff like that say about something yeah well you got listened you know that imagine divorce you gotta go back because if you called your wife commits adultery you're as guilty she is right we don't talk about that you know so and if you want those who commits adultery you're legally able to put her away marry again just like she did like today because you did you can't take them back you're not supposed to even a minister no ain't all that Minister go way out here wait on that yeah no no no no no we are uh we're a little bit different but God didn't change his mind we just don't do that no more when Christ came on earth he didn't say that I'm gonna do away with the Old Testament what did the Bible say he was born under the law to bring us out from under the law but he didn't destroy the law he magnified no where's he made it livable where we can live that and then he'll never ask another person that he wouldn't never ask another person to do that so therefore you don't change if he changed then he come back and said well you're not supposed to but listen Christ is living in us we're hearing from God inside of us okay I go I got a little bit on that later on the one man one do it's me for then would they not have ceased to be offered if it made a perfect one time they didn't need off from the more right because that the worshiper once purged or what done away with should have had no more conscience of sin now see now let's cover this just for a second because I want to cover this conscious memory reason conscious affects an imaginary that's your five realms in the middle and that's the whole problem now your conscience tells you of all the sin that you do and it ain't done okay but if your wife's purse you should have no more conscious of those things now when you main conscious sure we're conscious that where we did things wrong but we've got to come to a place that brother I don't say oh really you didn't do that the real you did not do those things that you did back then because Christ didn't do them and crisis in you now so he didn't do it therefore when we got to come to the place that we see this thing doesn't sin we stand in our consciousness knocked our body our body just revealed what our conscious was thinking okay and they didn't have a moral accomplished I mean they had a moral compass but not a guide that was close enough to say don't do that enough cuz remember he told him not to do those things he said no no but they wouldn't do them anyway and you know what they're gonna there's a lot of them gonna be in heaven not as bright but they're gonna be in heaven as Old Testament Saints goes remember they musta went to paradise so that's where all the Old Testament Saints went that works what we today Christians in the Old Testament because when Jesus died he went to paradise program didn't picked up the Saints that were in fair enough so there must have been a bunch so that was just a few there's a lot of people that's gonna be remembered oh that's imparted eternal life that's not eternal life while they were here if I got that right there was no way God could enter in a soul under the sacrifice and offerings didn't do that but remember we're gonna finish this maybe today but then when they would have ceased to be offered because it works who wants virtue there's no more conscious thing but in those sacrifices were remembered every year at the time of the Day of Atonement all Israel knew that because they were depending on that one priest to go in there and cover the sins of his for that year but they had to go back to next year then you have to go back the next year right remember something every year where it is not possible from here just here's your your Paul has given us right here where it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sin so they just continually have their sandwich okay in the Old Testament where for when he cometh into the world he says sacrifice and offerings that would it's not in other words did not desire because remember God really was thing about this other thing God knew the end from the beginning he knew how all this he knew what was gonna come about the day he knew who was gonna fall away he knew was gonna come in he knew all this to the very beginning but I think still when you do something right I think he's like that's my boy that's my girl even though he knew you were gonna do it before the foundation of the world yeah you come to the place you do it here and you go and then sometimes they'll come to remember what brother Brown said brother I've said the Holy Spirit would go back to God not to people but it's it's that mediator that position the Holy Ghost goes back said boy you sons acting good are your son's acting bad so so we still have these things on ice I thought well you know what brought the thought it was is that if I knew every move I made from now till the body change it probably scare me to death number one here you turn that tail but if we knew we were going to the body change and we saw herself with the body change we'd be so lakhs of days ago we'd be stuff we just be human let's see God let us live our day to day life not really knowing a lot what's going on ahead of time but giving us morning showing us things in the Bible and then to me that's the journey me and brother Keith was talking about that you gotta have a journey because the Bible says those who is justified he's already glorified if you justified today truly justified and went to the new birth then you're already horrified but you're still gonna live that life that's the journey of justification is that petition baptism okay therefore when he comes to the world says sacrifice and offerings down wouldest not know words he didn't want that to happen he knew it was going to happen but he don't want that to happen he wanted us to all come just like Adam but you know what that would have took away a lot of things a lot of attributes of dying listen folks this is the way God saw it or ain't done no surprises this is the whole plan brother Graham said he had a plan and the purpose in Christ inventions are revealed God had a plan and a purpose and he was going to see the chief mean you don't leave him home please see our plans already we're happy when we do but most of our plans from the beginning to the end is written in pencil you know but here's your drinking blood and then don't change amen so we just depend on him but the body has now prepared me that's what he's always wanting God has always wanted children in human flesh to live with him you know why cuz that's how he started his first man his first family with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and that's what we're going back to when he had to come as a body yet becomes a body a human body to be the sacrifice right come from ever and I'll give you this not next honey but the next honey I want to back up to that want to bring me something out of Isaiah 53 where the Bible says he gave he gave his soul an offering for sin offering here at some his self he gave his soul or ransom did say anything about the body he gave his soul Lorenza they'll see his body's not what came back into you at the new birth it was his salt but he did have a body a body has that one prepared me now you can take that as dual meaning because who is his body today we are a body since acts 2:38 the body hast thou prepared me what we're preparing this body for God because we're the only body on the earth if you'll ever have until he comes back with us in the Millennium this is the only body they hit that he's gonna have this is the body of Christ can you touch the body [Music] the body of the soundhole used in the very wide application literally or figuratively see that body is a figure a body both of men and animals identified here court with him on that the living body of animals the body planets body stars through it mystical body how many times brother Graham looked at word of the ethical program calls us the mystical body of Christ wrote in the New Testament of the church so Strong's had enough of us had enough for me from a from his revelation to know that that body just didn't mean Jesus's natural body it's his natural body had to come but he was building another body on the day of Pentecost excuse me called a bride in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin that was had no pleasure then said hello I come watch interpolating because remember take that out and all he would say it low they said lo I come to do thy will O God go that is the scripture back in the Old Testament but Paul interpolation tells you where it's coming from in the volume of the book it is written of me what book the Bible the Torah whatever you want to say brother Brown said that the Jews thought they got got in letter for I mean they got the Book of Ruth but they got God in letter form that's why I said today then since it but today you got to remember today is not the written word that written were to kill you as long as it stays there but if that comes in here okay then makes a big difference okay conditional condemn you always but if you become the word we've become the workers we received the word we don't become typewritten letters right no no if there was a big top Ryder no he just told you what he wanted to live in a Bonnie [Music] but a bunny you want to live in a human body the Bible has become flesh and when we see that more and more we will take a body change because that's where your body changes it's in this portrait in this word right here where your body changes right so this is the word made flesh [Music] yeah that's not life now that inside of you is love but that's not a lot of work that's well that's I tell you what it is that's that's a man compiling words but God giving the thought that can put them in there but God's got to reveal this cuz remember every time a small church this day it's probably reading a body Donna has prepared me where the bride of Jesus Christ but remember God's not didn't love church today okay he's an individual but he's not in that church system anymore let me put it that way God's not add a church system okay he is not in the badness system then he can be in the people but else preaching that would mean brother we went to vote in him and we stayed over Wednesday night the brother Brown said we're not getting people to Christ we're getting them to what we've just been getting them for 50 years we've been getting them to books and tapes and up and you look what brother they'll freeze and he's going around buying freaks and simple salvation why because if you're not born again that is just this is just words in dudes and don't this is no more than a tent no let me say something about that this is the 10 commandments to the bride just like he killed is rule that's gonna kill us I'm talking about the books in the tape okay we've dealt with hand grass and all that stuff for 50 something years but that's not what this message is about this message is Christ and when you get people to Christ and you get a born-again the right way I'm glad other preachers are seeing it besides us real and wrote III blue piece of it is is one of the most guilt off subject still six years after brother brown made a quote in lasting 59 that we're not the new birth is one of the most deal taught subject we've heard sermon after sermon don't you believe the message can we believe the message do you cut your hair no do you wear pants no well you must be born again well now that's a lot right that's a lot and you know we're last come from God hey the Prophet thank comes from the devil himself he is a liar and if he tells you something contrary the word it's a lot of did come from God alright I've come to do that well in the volume of the book is written now see we have to get it out of the Bible don't get me wrong don't throw the bottle away don't throw books away we have to get it out of there but if it's just a cloak that's why we've been here this long above when he said sacrifice and offered to burn opened an office in that what is none neither hash pleasure there in which are offered by the law so you have no pleasure in that he didn't want to see all those animals died because of the sin of man but you don't want that's the way it came to that the way he accepted that sacrifice point but remember we're coming down to the place where he accept one sacrifice he gave itself he gave his soul a ransom so he could see a sea which is you and I right because the body was a sacrifice the soul is what Satan was looking at and say it wanted that soul he wants your soul right by which will I'm sorry this study though I come to do that little guy he taketh away the first now remember he didn't take it away and all right we don't read Old Testament no it's nobody said because we remember Paul didn't have a New Testament he was writing it so he was looking back in the Old Testament and got all this new revelation and the haircut he said look he taketh away the first what sacrifice and offering that he may establish decided which is who himself Christ by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Christ once for all all right does not have to get up on the cross again and die every time we need something but now remember to do brother rhythm preach the indictment he indicted this generation for the second crucifixion of Christ going back to Matthew 17 where he'd come off the mountain he said television of no one till the Son of Man be risen again they killed the son of man put him on cross and he killed him again to the denomination like this he's to be resurrected beginning me and you amen all right the Son of Man which is what God in human flesh and that's what we are now working you play and every priest stands daily ministering offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand with God from went forth expecting until his enemies be made as let's do now how is he doing that through a bride remember you have to have a foot put on the stoop for it to be a foot stood and the only foot he's got down here is us alright so there's a body sticking with the speed on the footstool so it's the body of Christ that's here on the earth today comes remember and the enemies will be made as footstool and remember Paul said the last enemy to be destroyed is what dad alright so now you and I have a scripture that says we which are alive and remain we're gonna read it again this afternoon that's specific to me and you that's our scripture but we're not leaving up next on this is our scripture to use usually instumental we what you're allowing their length for by one offering if perfected forever them dinner sanctified usual I still have problem well you the one that happened not good you doing this guy not him but he just told you right here when we gonna start believing the Bible by one offering he has perfected forever them all right scuse me we're of the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that he has said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days says the Lord as he wrote this this is an Old Testament Paul quotes the Old Testament if you got Scofield Bible you can run your references every time Paul says something like that it'll reference back he's actually quoting the Old Testament just like brother Branham come Paul here comes as a prophet in the first days quoting the Old Testament most of this sermon is the Old Testament don't even got a New Testament then you got another ground come on the earth and most of the time even in during his preaching he's quote scripture about 90% of the time he's quoting scripture not verbatim but he's weaving in English into a sermon alright because you can't get anything outside of the Bible that's what our problem is everybody thinks like we were talking about the Seventh Seal everybody thinks it's this and that and did so younger than him coming back in the tent and go ride a horse you got killed there and got to do this and to do that that's the Seventh Seal that's what the Bible said okay and then brother realm is said revealing Christ so where's Christ will reiterate that this afternoon this is the comment that I'll make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts remember Ezekiel I'll give you a new heart and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no I say believe it's done this you got to believe that now we're a remission of this is there's no more offering percent be baptized for the remission having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way see the common man couldn't approach God in the Old Testament he had to go to the priest and then the priest when did the offering not now you can as brother Keith was preaching here any person I think pretty much is brother brother Tim's dick then we all have gifts in the body not spiritual gift doesn't just work in the Paco memory you've got a knife here you've got not spiritual gift ok what is them your sisters gonna have wisdom wisdom prophecy all these different things you can have they send the body it's not just in five whole minutes I send the whole body but yet all that they send the body not just in five whole ministry what what everybody pretty much is blade pretty much on the ministry to do that no well we it's like men Keith we're talking about brother Hampton we made her online well a minor or the life
