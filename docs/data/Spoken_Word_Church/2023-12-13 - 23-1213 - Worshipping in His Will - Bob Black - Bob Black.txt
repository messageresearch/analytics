and everybody in prayer this weather change all the temperature change and all that it's it's not it's not hot up here like it was down there is it um so tonight we're going to I just want to take a little scripture in from 1st Chronicles chapter 13 and I'm probably going to start reading this and you be like I I know I know where that came from I know where where brother Brown mentioned this um and just take a little title um worshiping worshiping in his will because that's how we want to worship not just in our own will or our own thoughts but to worship God in his will and his ways in his time and in his season amen and uh we know uh God's got everything in control let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord we're so grateful Lord for all the things that you've done for us Lord and so grateful that we can have confidence and peace Lord in the midst of troubles Lord Jesus that you're influencing things Lord we may not be able to see uh you at work uh right right away but we know God that you're with us you never you promis you'd always be with us you never forsake us you never leave us alone you'd always be there for us and I thank God for all these promises that we can have access to Lord Jesus through your word and I pray Lord that tonight Lord that you'll just give confidence as the people hear your word Lord that you'll give them confidence Lord that you're with us Lord maybe maybe in some some places you give a little a little extra Shake Lord that we need something a little bit more than maybe maybe uh we're professing so far we ask Lord that you'll just help us tonight Lord that you'll open up your word to us be with my lips Lord that I'll speak truth in your name amen thank so 1 Chronicles 13 we're just going to read the whole chapter um and it's it's a a nice little story here so um even though it's lengthy I think we'll get to it uh in no time so verse one it says and David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds and with every leader and David said unto all the congregation of Israel if it seemed good unto you and that it be of the Lord Our God let us send abroad unto our Brethren everywhere that are left in all the land of Israel and with them also to the priests and Levites which were in their cities and suburbs that they may gather themselves unto us and let us bring again the Ark of our God to us for we inquire not at it in the days of Saul and all the congregation said that they would do so for the thing was right in the eyes of all the peop amen so David gathered all Israel together from sheor of Egypt even unto the entering of HTH to bring the Ark of God from Kur jiram boy that's a tongue twister and David went up and all Israel to baa that is to Kurth jiram which belonged to Judah to bring up then the Ark of God the Lord and that dwelleth between the cherubims whose name is called on it and boy there's some good stuff to pull out of here in there and they carried the Ark of God and a new cart out of the house of abinadab and usza and a heo drave the C and David and all Israel played before God with all their might and with singing and with Harps and with suies and with timbral and with symbols and with trumpets and when they came under the threshing floor of shedon oza put forth his hand to hold the ark for The Oxen stumbled and the anger of the Lord was kindled against oza and he smote him because he put his hand to the ark and there he died before God and David was displeased because the Lord had made a breach upon usza wherefore that place is called per peroza to this day and David was was afraid of God that day saying how shall I bring the Ark of God home to me so David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David but carried it aside into the house of obededom the GTI and the Ark of God remained with the family of obededom in his house three months and the Lord blessed the house of obededom and all that he had you may be seated the Lord blessing bless the reading of his word now you lay out that uh if you really lay out the summation of all that story you can see that David uh started off with a good a what looked like a really good idea that he wanted to restore uh the the Ark of of God he wanted to restore bring it into the where the children of Israel were and and he went forth with all of the the Sues and the timal and the symbols and everything but then at the end of that story somebody died so something was off somewhere and you see you look at this story and you can kind of picture that uh d going forth thinking that uh oh oh I I I I got something I've got an understanding of God I'm I'm going forth and I'm I I I know what I'm supposed to be doing I we're here we go with the ark but something was out of place somewhere now if you would just want to maybe think think about ourselves this morning it's it's really human nature just as a result of the Fall just a result of the the predicament that we're in to ignore like like David was doing there's something wrong but it's our it's our nature to ignore our predicament y to ignore our faults to ignore our situation a lot of times oh that's why we need that's why we got to come to church that's why we have the Bible to expose these little issues and things in our lives that we're we're just because of how we are that we just Overlook we fail to see our our own mistakes we fail to see the way that we are we fail to see a lot of times where we messed up and and you know you come to church and you hear the preaching of the word or you you look into the Bible and you're sitting there meditating on things and it'll exposes our flaws that without that there would be no way for you to be able to see the real picture of who you are I thank God for the revealing of his word I thank God for his word that we can hold that word up to ourselves and see a reflection back are you a reflection of Christ or are you a reflection getting there almost are you you can hold it up to yourself and you can see your mistakes and your failures or you can see where where it's starting to look like a masterpiece yeah and what I'm talking about is I I was I was telling brother Wade I I had to ride down to Atlanta today just to kind of go into work and and see everybody they had a little holiday thing and I was sitting there in traffic and I started thinking uh now now the cars have blind spot detectors they got a little light but back in the day back before we had all this technology we didn't have a little light that would light up you had to be real careful when you merged over into the other lane look in your mirrors and everything is because there's a blind spot a blind spot where you could have a problem if you weren't aware of it and what a blind spot is it's an area you cannot an area where we cannot see or we choose not to see that thing and I I was I think you know as we're looking at this picture of David coming with this with the ark transported the wrong way and all all the all the doings and all the things around it and he had a big old blind spot that he couldn't see that something was not right something wasn't right and so that's why maybe tonight we can look and examine our own selves to see if maybe we have a blind spot something something that just didn't something that we're not doing right now blind spot is our aspects it's an aspect of your personality or behavior or thinking pattern that's it's real obvious blind spots are obvious to others everybody on the road can see if there's a car in your blind spot everybody else can see it but not you not you now isn't that funny how blind spots work a lot of times that everybody else maybe they can point out your blind spot oh You' got a problem with this or whatever but you just won't realize it a lot of times until something happens God will shake you like he shook David sometimes you'll shake a young person and make them realize well all those things that my mom and daddy told me about it turned out to really be true I I do need a little bit of an education I do need uh a good job I do need to be able to position well so that when I get married I can provide for my family all these things that they tried to prepare me and then you get out in real life and then you get shooken shaken a little bit and it's a blind spot now why do we have blind spot I wish we didn't have blind spots but it's just human nature I got blind spots I I today I was I was I'm just telling myself a little bit I was uh we had a meeting at work and somebody was saying uh well what did you invite so and so that was was very important to a project and I was sure that I had invited that person to that meeting but turned out I had forgotten to invite and that's just a little a little trifling example but there's all sorts of things that like that through life that we just we're blind to oh but then you open up the pages of God's word and it reveals something that's lacking in our lives I want to think now now we're not talking about little trifling things tonight though we're talking about the word of God we're talking about and if there's a blind spot in the word God can sure see it in our lives and that's why he wants us to get in the word and just lay in the word lay in it so it'll just have an influence in our lives and it will expose these little these little problem areas the little foxes that spoil the vine it's something a blind spot is is something wrong despite our best intentions our best effort that'll hinder you just like it hindered David it hindered David's communion with God it hindered his fellowship with God until there ended up being somebody dying because he left something undone he wasn't doing something right in that situation we got to deal with our blind spots amen now what brother R said here he said we see here what David done in the scripture reading of First Chronicles 13 his intentions were good but God now now think about this now y'all know how I preach sometimes I just I I like to preach in a way that just makes you think and meditate and reflect on what brother random was saying his intentions were good but God does not give us merits on good intentions now you see how easy it is to leave things undone we come to church many times and we've got a good intentions we've got good intentions about being a Christian we got good intentions but good intentions are not enough oh good intentions are not enough my friend there's only one way to serve god brother brandom said and that's by doing his will at his command I well of course every everybody tonight if we would examine ourselves we would all say I want to do his will but when it really gets down to the nitty-gritty when it's really laid there in front of you are you willing to do his will are you willing to do what he's asking and what he's asking is for us to just believe him brother R said one great thing about God he has not left us without knowing what's the truth and how to do it he wouldn't be just to punish us for doing something that we didn't know how it was going to be done and then let us stumble into something he is not that kind of a God so he let David know what he was supposed to be doing David knew David knew the right approach the what right way to carry that art oh goodness I'm all twisted up here I apologize yall he knew the right way the right approach to carry that Arc he knew the right way to worship and and you and I know the right way to worship thank God we know the truth we know the right way to approach God we know how to get to God and and brother R said how we know we know the truth and how to walk in it and how it work now you think about these we know how to how to get to God we know how it works we know how to get healing how the the recipe for all these things is laying there in the word how do you get healing you repent of your sins and lay it before God have faith wait on God and watch God go to work how do you get somewhere with God by believe in what he's done and have confidence look looking brother Bram said he's a God that speaks the word and expects his children to believe it now there's an expectation laying there in front of every one of us tonight that he Expect When God Says something he expects for us to believe it he doesn't he he's not anticipating for us to get all worked up and all emotional and all in a big tizzy or something but they have confidence in God what if God said something we have we can have confidence we don't have to get all worked up and get all and a big tizzy or something uh watching things maybe maybe go a a little different way than the way that he he we expect but to just have confidence that no matter what happens I I I I believe I certainly believe that tonight every Christian here can be a real Optimist can be somebody that can be like joob laying there on an as sheep that says well despite all of these things yet I know that in my flesh I shall see God a real Christian is going to be an optimist no matter what life throws at you always looking up speaking up talking up working up you're you're looking up to what God has already said you're not looking down you're not talking down to your children you're not talking down to somebody else but you're speaking up up up always because that's the way that God wants to go up always and oh thank God that you can know how to get to God you can know how to meet God and then brother Bram said in them days they had only one meeting place where they could meet God and that was at the ark under the blood oh he said that's the only that's the only meeting place yet under the blood The Mercy Seat was sprinkled to give Mercy to the worshiper the asker when he come to ask the petition of God so if you want to get anywhere with God tonight oh if You' got that token life to hold over to hold over your prayer you can have confidence that God hears your prayer because you coming the way that God prescribed to us to come under the blood covered under the blood that God made a sacrifice to us as he shed his blood on the cross and you're coming not with that the natural blood dripping over your life but the this that life that was in that blood applied to your life and you're coming to God with that in that way brother Brown said and God had a special routine the way you had to go to knew about that and he wouldn't accept anything else he won't accept any other way than by the blood the only way to get to God Is by The Blood Brother br will say I'm so glad that you can find reconciliation through the offering of the blood by hearing the word now look at that pattern there you want to get to the blood there's only way only way you can get to the blood is through the word the only way that you can get that get to that life the life that's in the blood is through the word by hearing the word and the washing of the Water by the word it actually cleanses us that as you hear the word it's actually cleaning you how is it cleaning you because it exposes these blind spots and things in your life it makes you realize there's something wrong it brings you it calls you to repentance you begin to ask God for forgiveness and it begins to have an effect in your life and David here we see that in his heart he wanted to do something that was good right he wanted to do something that was good amen he had no bad motive or no bad objective right the Ark of the Lord was away from the people and he wanted to bring the Ark of God back to his place so the people will consult God about the things that they wanted so he had a good motive he didn't have a bad motive he didn't have a bad objective he wanted to bring the Ark of the Lord to the people and brother said we find out through here where he put his name and that's the only place that he meets his worshipper and his name was Jesus Christ God's name is Jesus Christ and he said God had a way of doing things but David just thought that he would just do something for God anyhow and he never went about it in the right way amen now that's where it gets examined in times so many times we can think that we're doing things the right way but are doing it the way that God wants us to do it we can have all kinds of ideas about how that we we can ask the church to pray for something that ain't even right ask the church to sponsor something that ain't even right go out in the world and do something and maybe slap a label on it and say well well you know we're I'm as I've asked everybody to pray do something maybe go to a ball game or something and say they somewhere you know you're not supposed to be or I'm not preaching against ball games but you just something unroll the list and and you know you're not supposed to be doing it but you think that you think in your mind that you think you're supposed to you're you're doing it and you don't do it in the right way you so many times we think that we're we're we're worshiping the way that God wants us to do it or we're doing what God wants us to do but we're not and he said brother R would say God Reveals His word in his own predestinated season so he's building up for he's building up a recipe for us to know if we're doing if we're approaching God in the right way he's he's building up his recipe his his plan so that we can have confidence that we're approach our approach is correct now now let's back up a second because we know that God said he will do nothing until he reveals to his servants the prophets now there's one of the one of the main components of this thing he won't do anything until he reveals it to his servants the prophets so when God speaks his word to a prophet then if you're saying the same thing you're aligning yourself with what God spoke through that Prophet now that's why that's why I believe you know uh when you when me anyway when I started preaching you know you kind of think sometimes I just go sit under a tree and maybe would God will just kind of give me something to minister but I believe in this day God has given us a word to preach we're just our brother R said so many times he just said say what I say just say what I say in other words there's a track there's a line to preach for that goes from being born again to adoption to a Rapture and there's a lot of little odds and ends and things that we can preach but he just said say what I preach there's a lot of I could go and break apart all the candlesticks and all the types and different lot of things but you you won't be preaching that that line from being born again to adoption to all the way up to to take us to a Rapture so if we're saying what brother Brandon preached then we can have confidence that we're preaching along the lines that God wanted to in this season so we're not preaching we're not preaching what Martin Luther said although it's part it's part of the recipe we're not just preaching what John Wesley said but now we're preaching what God sent To Us by a prophet to unfold to us the complete revelation of Jesus Christ in this day and so to that you see the recipe there is you've got to get under the word for your day you've got to receive what God has for you to receive in the season that it was given so we're not living in the season of Martin Luther we're not living in the season of John Wesley but we're we're living in the season of a Casto unfolding of the seven seal revelation of the seven Mysteries of the Thunders we're living in that kind of a season now brother R said how could Martin Luther a no a message about note about the message today Martin Luther could not have known about the message today how how could the Presbyterians the Presbyterians could not have known about the message of today Martin Luther oh think about this Martin Luther read the same Bible we did but it wasn't time in his day for him to understand the things that we can preach about because God sent a prophet and that's what we're preaching that's what we're called to preach not just the little pity Patty BTY things but what God sent through a prophet he said Wesley said read the same Bible Marthur Martin Luther did but Wesley was not sent to preach what Martin Luther was sent to preach Wesley was sent to preach what God sent him to preach and the Pentecostals read the same Bible that we read and Jesus would say brother man would say Jesus read the same Bible that the Pharisees read now to think about that that different groups can read the same Bible and read it a different way that we're reading the same Bible that the Pharisees read and that Martin Luther read but but now that we're preaching in something that's greater it's grown into because it's a different season it's a different time it's a time for us to understand not just in park not through like a lattice looking at something dark and Shadow but so now we can see the fullest the full revelation of Jesus Christ and brother and would say God reveals this word in the seas in it to whom he chooses to reveal it to aren't you so glad tonight that he chose to reveal it to you he knew that you would wanted he knew that before the foundation of the world that you'd be sitting here tonight I I think that's maybe one of the things that you go to a camp meeting or somewhere and they they'll really highlight the fact that you're supposed to be sitting here tonight but I want to highlight tonight that here under the Wednesday night sitting here in the tire in middle of the week service God knew that you would be here before the foundation of the world he knew you'd be sitting here and he knew that you would want it and he chose you to reveal it to God God chooses who he reveals it to he chose that before the foundation of the world and he knew that you would be sitting here in the season of this time in the time when this would be preached when this would be revealed brother B said it's the Sun that brings a seed through it stages now you think you think of the winter time the sun is only shining for a few hours a day in the springtime it shines forth a little bit more in the summertime it's just maybe 12 hours a day and there's different Seasons where that same sun is drawing up the seed from the ground the same sun is pulling up that seed through the different stages of life it's the sun that's pulling it was the same Sun the same Holy Ghost and power that pulled that life up all the way down through all the different ages from Martin Luther the John Westley Pentecost up up up and till finally we're in this age and brother B said when it's tender and young bring it out of the ground the sea then give it its leaves in another stage of the Sun hot sun will kill it if it's the ripening seed or ripening time so he regulates the Sun and regulates nature to meet his word yeah oh think about that that even in your own life he regulated the sun was regulating your growth there was a time when you just couldn't take the abundance of the word it would have killed too much word kills the plant but there's a time when you could only take just a little bit but that's still that same son was pulling and drawing you drawing you to himself and brother RMA said who is it that will dare he's talking about he's talking about the life drawing how could you look at a little plant that's just barely come out of the ground and say well I don't think that's the real thing how could you look at something look at something and and criticize how can we look at one another and criticize and say well I don't think you're the real thing I don't oh brother there's that scripture in the Bible that says wait until it grows up wait wait until the te wheat and the tears are grown up together before you go pluck it out wait and see and brother R say who is it that will dare to correct him and say now Lord you made a mistake you made a mistake by putting this man in the ministry this man doesn't believe like we believe who is going to tell God he is wrong in itly sometimes we get so critical we want to put somebody out when God might still be working on them and drawing them and pulling them oh I'm so glad we got a God that knows what he's doing when so many people could have been critical of Me Maybe still are critical of me will you put it whatever category it needs to be in but yet God's still drawing God's still working God's still pulling brother R would say he made this statement in this sermon he knows what he is doing he knows what he's doing as he's drawing he said he knows who to choose and who not to choose what to do and when to do it I'm talking about what to do now what to preach to a people that need it in the season that we're living in when to do it in the seventh Church age as a bride is being called out not just Brides brides churches churches but a bride that will be the fullness of the godhead bodily he said no matter how much we think that a certain person is qualified to do a certain job God knows who is qualified for the time and the season or the time and the right time to do it God knows who was qualified he said the real true Christian the real True Believer in God Waits upon the Lord for these things oh he said wait now that was a lesson there was a lesson just to meditate on for a moment wait when God says something wait he told the the the disciples go go to Jerusalem and wait until you be and de with power from on high and brother R would say wait wait on your ministry if you feel like you're called to be a preacher wait and see he said if you feel a call be sure that it's God be sure that it's right now I find it just in life now this is a good life lesson sometimes it's good to just wait and not just rush into something just rush head long but just wait and wait and pray and T and wait and see what God has to say about it search through the scriptures and see what God has to say about your decision but wait and and see if see before you just jump jump into it he said be sure that is timely of what you're saying the Bible said they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with the wings like an eagle they shall run and not be weary if they'll walk they'll not faint and to a Christian now waiting means expecting when you see a promised Lona there in the Bible you wait with expectation I believe it's going to happen that's what brother Ram told us when we come to church you come to church expecting expecting whatever your need is you come to church expecting to be healed respecting to receive expecting receive a blessing expecting to hear from God and that's our problem so many times we don't come to church expecting to hear from God we've got our little our little ideas about the person behind the pullit we've got our ideas about the church maybe we got all these ideas built up and we failed to expect that God is going to speak to us but if we'll come like that waiting waiting to hear from God and expecting with patience now that's how a Christian Waits with patience patience that kind of a patience if you got patience you can wait on your brother and you can wait on God that's what real patience is the ability to wait sit on that ashle Heap like job and just wait for God to move sit there and wait and see the Deliverance of God if you have if you've got got wayward children sit there and wait not in a tizzy not in a frame of mind where you don't even know what's up and what's down but wait with confidence that you serve a God that hears your prayer wait believing trust and faith is how a Christian Waits with spiritual preparedness oh you made yourself ready you made yourself ready as much as you can like that sermon that brother R preached be still and know or be certain of God be certain of God when I when youve done everything that you can well you've dotted all the eyes and all the teas that you know how to Dot and everything that you can do you've done then all you can do is wait but now you can wait in confidence knowing you've done everything that you can and now you can wait a trust in God's Providence oh as a Christian can't we do that can't we have that kind of a confidence in a God that still influences lives that still influences us that can still move like that that Dove spirit that moved over the water when the world was created he could still move over your children's Hearts he could still move over your wayward loved ones and draw them back to himself that's the kind of confidence that God wants us to have and brother R said notice David king of Israel just anointed Samuel poured the oil upon him and he was chosen of God to be king of Israel and David got this Revelation to bring the Ark of the Lord up to the city of David now you think about what brother R's laying out for us that David was just anointed he wasn't just some some uh Center out in a strip club or something he was anointed the prophet of God had poured all on his head and he was chosen of God and David got a revelation but yet the sum of the story is he did it wrong he did it wrong and at the end of the story there was death if you do it wrong it's going to bring death David got this Revelation to bring the Ark of the Lord up to the city of of David because that's what God wanted to happen he wanted that Ark to be put he wanted the ark to be restored amongst the people but David did it all wrong a revelation is something that surprising and you didn't know about the Revelation was the ark needs to be restored it does in this day it needs to be restored the word needs to be restored let's get back let's get back to the original truth and brother B would say now there is nothing wrong but you see David went at it wrong right it wasn't the prophet Nathaniel that got the Revelation now that goes back to what my point earlier God will do nothing until first he reveals it to his servants the prophets so in this day if you get right unline in line under what the prophet said just say what the prophet said just just do what the prophet said if the prophet said it that's that's that's my that's everything that we hang everything on the prophet said it I I'm talking about a real Revelation not just not just quotes that we can argue over and things that we can debate over whether this or whether that but I'm talking about a real revelation of what our Prophet said in this day and he said it was not the prophet Nathaniel that got the Revelation it was David the king that got the Revelation David said now let's get back to god let's get back to the right thing let's go down and bring the presence of God into the city let's hold a Revival let's bring the people back but he got the Revelation which seemed to be good but it wasn't the will of God now now look he how he did he this is just how a lot of us do we want everybody's opinion but God's opinion yeah we want to know we want to somebody's doing wrong in the church and they they're they're about to fall flat on their face and and they want to go find some Minister that will bless like a like a priest bless what they're doing I bless what they want to go find somebody to say what you're doing is right they but they don't want what God said they want somebody they want to go find their friend to say you know I think what you're doing is right they want to go find somebody at school there anybody to to bless or to to to to kind of back up what they're doing other than what the God said am so this is what David did he brother said he went to the church nominal and asked if it out of the Revival sure come on I believe it's a good thing he said the priest now look how he the priests the scribes the captains of thousands the captains of hundreds and he consulted them was this the will of the Lord and they all said it was they said it was sure what you do now is that oh God wants us to God wants each of us to have our own Revelation he wants you to have a revelation of where you're supposed to be going to church and where you're where you're supposed to be living and where you're supposed to be going to work what you're supposed to be doing in life what your position in life is and see you can't you can't go through life holding on to somebody's coattails if you hold on to somebody's coattails you're holding on to what God revealed to them but it might not be applicable to you you got to have your own experience what happens if you're holding on to somebody's coattails and then God takes them out of the way and you can't hold on to their cails anymore and your whole life experience is just ruined it's destroyed because that was your experience to hold on to your pastor's coils or hold on to a Deacon's coils or some man when you're supposed to be holding on to God you're supposed to have a relationship with God not with a man that's what God wants you to do the priest the scribes the captains of thousands everybody except for God he said not oh not what do you think not what do they think but what does God think oh that's what I want to know church tonight I want to know what God thinks oh when you get into your little prayer closet which so many people have stopped doing by the way people don't even hardly pray anymore because they don't want they don't care about what God thinks they don't care about a personal experience anymore they just want to come and come to church and go through the motions and do the things that they think that they should be doing and not have a real true genuine experience with God that's why brother BR laid it out he said in the days of Saul they left DOL Consulting God by the ark they left off W to know what God Said by the urum Thum they left off doing that instead of asking the source that he should have asked he consulted his captains and his great man he failed to ask the main resource that God always deals through and you can find so many examples through the scripture like that story that I like to quote a lot of times where the Prophet prophesied that Josiah was going to be born here comes another Prophet to tell him contrary oh you've got to have your own Revelation Church you've got to have your own experience to where if some other Prophet comes out from the bushes and tells you something contrary you got to have enough confidence like Paul said if anybody if an angel from heaven comes and says something contrary to what I have preached let him be a cursed David's brother said David his intention was good his motive was good his objective was good and to bring a Revival in the city bring the people back to God but he never consulted the way God told him to do it how do we consult the way God tells us to do things in this age oh let me see what a prophet said about it let me compare it back with the word of God in the season and the time that we're living in let me compare it back understanding the day and the hour that we're living in and brother said all the people agreed and the priest and that the King was right they needed the ark back in the city they needed a Revival they needed the presence of God but God had not promised to reveal his word in its season to the peoples he never promised to reveal it to the king in the season that sounds contrary doesn't it but God you're talking about having a personal revelation it better line up with what the prophet says everything we do amen every action we take amen everything we stand for was must line up with the word that we've heard in this age and that's kind of maybe a difficult thing to articulate my revelation God will give me a revelation but it's not going to be something like just sitting up under a tree like the gnostics believed in the early church that we can just come up with some idea that doesn't line up with the Bible it's got to line up with what brother brandham said like in the days of Micah when they oh they had a they had they had a re Revelation they knew that that that land Joshua divided it for the people and give it to them and the Philistines had taken it over and they knew that that land was there but yet it wasn't time to take it they knew it was time they had a revelation that that land was theirs but and Ahab said we got a place up there at ramth Gilead that actually belongs to us but Jehoshaphat said we need to we need to consult the Lord first let's see what the Lord has to say about it right and there were 400 other prophets 400 others that stood separate from Micah oh God if God can just get a hold of one man that's all he's looking for tonight just somebody that he can get a hold of and use their life somebody that will stand for him even if there's 400 other prophets 400 other people that believe different but if God's behind you if God's behind you how can you fail Micah said I saw all Israel scattered upon pulling the hills a sheep that have not a Shepherd what's what can we get from that it matters who you listen to Micah versus 400 other prophets but it mattered because Micah's word was right and brother R would say you say Prophets The Very man that consented to kill Jesus Christ prophesied because it was his office he was high priest that year these men looked upon it in a natural sense it belongs to us but you see they didn't find the word and will of God it might say on paper that it belongs to you it might say on paper you can read it in the Bible it belongs to you but you better wait on the will of God wait on the will of God until you can actually claim it the way that God wants you to claim it going the right Avenue and the right Channel with the right approach and the right motives and all of those things so that God can manifest it in your life Micah come down and he had a vision and it was absolutely contrary to the others because why it's got to be the word with the word and at the season now now now listen church tonight listen what brother Ram saying he said David sent singers and he sent people with Harps oh they were having a real good worship service as they carry that art they were praising God and believing that they were doing everything right he sent people with Harps with trumpets and they done every religious thing that they knowed how to do and still God God was not in it now now look look what happens when God is in it when God was in it when Solomon dedicated the temple just about before they even brought the ark I think it was before they that before they could even get everything situated the the Holy Ghost just the presence of God filled that place so much until they couldn't even they couldn't even see to be able to worship that's what the Bible says that the priest could not even see in order to minister to the people oh but when when they when everything was all out of kilter it just didn't work right brother R said David shouted with all of his might and he screamed and he jumped and he went through every religious motion that there could be and still God was not in it everything David did it didn't work oh if you want to get the real baptism of the Holy Ghost if you in need of a blessing you come according to God's approach you come according to the way God said it if you want to see a blessing in the church come according to the way that God said it and make sure that his will you're aligned with his will and doing it the way that God wants it son he said their Rel religious emotion and stuff was great their intentions was great their Crusade was great their singing was great their dancing was great their shouting was great their music was great and they had the ark they had the ark and all that represented they had the ark and all of the things that were on the inside of it the tables of stone and the the Almond bud and all the the and all that there but what good is the ark what good is all of that without God it's just a wooden box just a couple of tables of stone what good does it do to be baptized if you're not first repenting right I'm going to go baptize myself get get baptized and not repent what good does it do what good does it do to take communion and become a hypocrite if you don't live the life and believe the rest of God's word what good does it do oh oh this might be a kind of a hard thing to preach on tonight but what good does it do if you're taking communion What You Won't Do the rest what good does it do if you take communion just to please your mama and your daddy and do all these things what good does it do if you leave the rest undone what good does any of it do without God that's what I want is I want God I want God to look at my life and be pleased with it I want God to look at my sacrifice and be pleased with it I want everything that I do cuz what what good is any of it without God he said take part of it not the rest of but it shows there is something wrong what good are all the rituals and the sacrifices without God take all of it the word and the blood what good is the word without the blood what good is the doctrine without the life what good are the symbols without the reality now think about that what good is the word if it's if the life cannot be manifest in your life what good is it to have all these symbols that we read about and not see it manifest what good is it and brother R said when all this happens see what happens when God and his age and his time is not considered just a people's idea that's right wait wait now this feels like kind of a harsh message tonight doesn't it but these are the things that brother branam brother R preached this sermon two times before he went off the scene and the last time he preached it was a month before he went off the scene and if you want to really get the essence of some kind of a cutting message you go back and listen listen to trying to do God a service without it being his will I want you to encourage I I think sometimes you know you preach and Minister people go back and listen to your sermons over and over again I don't want you to do that tonight don't listen to me go listen to what your Prophet said and see what he told you before he went off the scene see what he said at the end of that sermon and let it cut you deep let it cut and Scar and and mold you into the image of what he's trying to get across there at the end of that sermon he said wait you might want it but what does God say about it and that's what I want tonight I want to know what God said about anything before we make a decision before we do anything before I take a step in my life I want to know what God said about it I want to make sure that I'm lined up with the prophet of the age he said wait let me see what he said they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength but they consulted everyone else everybody else was consulted but God he said they consulted only the priest of that day the theologians the denominations and noticed by doing that Consulting the priest and Consulting the congregation Consulting the people they did it wrong the ark was the word we know that's right because the ark is Christ and Christ is the word see the ark or the word was not put in its first ordained original ordained position let us see brother R said what happens when God and his age and his time is not considered just the people's idea cuz we all we all got blind spots we all got our own ideas about the way things should work and the way things should go we all got these things these faults in ourself that we don't even recognize oh but the word will expose it the word will reveal our problems and the word will correct it he said by going to the priest by going to the theologians and by going to the military forces and not even considering their God sent message of the hour Nathan they did it wrong they went and picked up the arc and put it upon a new cart a new denomination going to start up and not upon the god-given ordained way to pack it now what's the ordained way to pack it not on some not on some animal carrying it like that pick that Ark up the Levites pick it up and put it over their heart that's the way God wants his word packed he wants to get a hold of somebody's heart he wants somebody to yield themselves to him if he could just get a hold of one person's heart somebody that'll stand in the face of 400 prophets or a thousand prophets or if everybody in the world was a prophet that preached contrary to what you believed it wouldn't matter at all he said you got to go back to the way that God said do it they put it on the shoulders of the Levites and that was over the heart the ark the word is not to be packed upon a new denomination now now we're not we're not struggling tonight with a denomination what we're struggling with is our own ideas and our own thoughts about how we think things should go but you don't pack it that way you don't pack it on some theories of some man some theories of somebody's ideas but you pack it over your heart over the heart where God can speak to even reveal himself to you the word of God is not to be handled by denominations it's to be handled by the heart of a man where God can come in there and reveal himself oh that's why so many times he would reiterate God don't care how much education you got he wants your heart he wants somebody's heart that he can soften up and make it from being Stony and rough and and won't come to the altar won't raise their hand and won't say Amen to where they'll give themselves holy to God the only one thing that Christ will be wrapped in and that's your heart not your Creed he wants your heart and then you think about this as we're approaching the holiday time that that's the only thing that he can be wrapped in there's no swaddling clothes that we can wrap him in today but he can be wrapped up in your heart and that's where God wants to be Psalm 119 said th word if I hid in my heart that I might sin against thee where not in my head but in my heart and Jeremiah 31 I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their God and they shall be my people and brother R would say notice upon the shoulders of the priests and David and all the priests that really ought to have know better but what was it he said the priest should have knowed better the scribes the theologians should have knowed better because the word said not to do that not to carry it in a cart pulled by an animal not to do that but to carry it on the levite shoulder over the heart oh there's no idea I'm just saying what brother Ram said there's no idea no thought no man no man's idea greater than God we must subject ourself to what God Said in the season and the time and the age that we're living sir the word for the season the time that they were living in was ignored ought to think now what are we talking about tonight that you can be real enthusiastic about coming to church you can be real enthusiastic about what you're doing you can be so stoked about what's happening but you can be enthusiastic and be wrong here's how what must take place to know you are right and we'll be closing in just a moment I was trying to go 45 minutes tonight and we're already in an hour actually we're we're about 50 minutes now you you've heard all these things before but tonight I'm just I'm just reiterating I'm calling I'm I'm restoring these things to your bringing bringing them to your remembrance he said notice there and following God and I want you to kind of jot this in your mind that keeps God's Commandments to do anything right for God to do God a service correctly there's five musts to do God's service correctly and these are all things laid out that to just reiterate what we've just been going over it's got to be his time it must be his time it must be the time the day and the hour that we're living it's time for the revelation of the son of man to be preached it's time for all these things to be preached he said what if Jesus would come and say now I tell you what we'll do we'll just go up on the mount like Moses did and get a new Declaration of LW he was that law amen and it must be his word it's got to be his word everything that we do is got to compare back to the word it's got to be his word it's got to be a present tense word a present tense word for the season and the time that we're living it's got to be his time and it's got to be his word it must be his word he said I don't care how much dignitary I don't care how many kings I don't care how many great preachers but compare everything back to the word and it must be by the person he has chose to give it and to do it it's got to be by the person that he chose he chose a person to deliver it and he chose a people to receive what was delivered it must come by the prophets and the prophet must be Vindicated amen and I'm I'm going to be winding down on this note to just kind of prepare to close but it must be V have you ever stopped to think about what it means to be Vindicated Vindicated means to be cleared from blame suspicion or doubt often after the fact in other words many people have maybe listened to brother R's message and thought well I don't know if that's true but you hang around long enough and let that word anchor in your life I know all the pillar of fire and all the all the pictures and things those are proofs but I'm talking about something different I'm talking about you begin to meditate on what he said and let it really anchor in your heart and soul and what maybe you originally thought was a little bit suspicious it begins to take root in your life and begins to change you and it removes all the doubt and that makes you the Vindication you the proof of the thing you sitting here tonight you are the proof and anything contrary to that word any man's idea anything like that will mess it up I'm talking about any influence contrary to the word will mess up the whole story let's wrap let's wrap up I I know I I feel everybody time to wrap up I'm anyway this thing this thing that David done without consulting the you and getting the word of the Lord for it it caused death to strike sincere people and brother Ram said as we as we're about to close he said they did two things wrong they went down there by not Consulting the word of God they didn't consult the word of God then when they did they went contrary to the word of God they didn't consult the word of God let's really anchor that in our hearts tonight the two things that they did wrong they didn't consult the word of God now that of course is going to lead into the next thing they went contrary to the word of God there's where you and I will always go astray if we don't consult the word of God let me see what God's word says about it and the Bible says in 1st Chronicles 13 the scripture we've been preaching from when they came under the threshing floor of chadon usza put forth his hand to hold the ark for The Oxen stumbled and the anger of the Lord was kindled against usza and he smote him because he put his hand to the ark and there he died before God when David saw this thing happened it woke him up now isn't that how we are so many times we got to be shaken to really wake up don't wake up too late out there brother he seen that death had hit what's the point brother R is making I don't care who says anything contrary to God's word I don't care who it is and he's laying it out all the ones I don't care don't care he said I don't care what I say brother brandom said I don't care what I say or anybody else says even putting it to his own self anybody says contrary to the word of God oh you just stay right with the word of God now there's a lesson for us all there's a lesson that sometimes takes us years to learn don't set your eyes on a man don't lift up don't get caught in the cult of personality don't lift up me or anybody else you stay right with word the word of God keep your eye on the word of God and nothing else he said look at the today the big Crusades that we've had across the land it's proven that it's been Vain and didn't Jesus here say now in Mark 7:7 in vain do they worship me what's he talking about that you can have all your dots your eyes dotted and all your tees crossed and every be be be real enthusiastic about it but yet be worshiping God in vain if you don't come according to those five musts what season are we living in what time are we living in who did God choose is it according to the word right all those things in anything contrary to the word and it season is inv V in vain did David bring the ark up in vain did Ahab train them prophets in vain did Baum take that money in vain because why they didn't wait the musicians can come they didn't wait they that have the spirit of God wait for these things amen and brother Ram said as we close he said and one day you'll see that the one that you f in your heart and see his identification will become personalized before you then you and he are one if you'll just wait and come according to those five mons you've United by the word and the Word was in the beginning will go back to the beginning which is God and that day you'll know that I am in the Father the father in me I and you and you in me he said how will he take his bride as we stand to our feet how will he take his bride by the word not a new cart not by some Theologian idea but according to his word he'll identify her don't put one thing to it or take one thing from it now leave it the way it is leave it the way it is and before we close I just want to encourage you when you go home and maybe you pull up this quote this sermon listen until he gets to Deuteronomy 4 and then pay real close attention to what he says at the closing of that sermon you love the Lord tonight let's let's worship him a little bit in song if we're coming according to his will we've got something to worship about don't we blessed [Music] ass Jesus is M oh what a forast of Glory Divine air of Sal if you have a need we're happy to pray with you God he
