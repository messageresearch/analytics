========================================

this ain't no this just think it's safe ignore resistant all right everybody hope everybody's doing well on this Easter Damon morning yes where we every Sunday you know we celebrate the resurrection of the Lord amen that's right but today symmetrically importance our nificantly special because if he didn't rise we don't rise naturally he was the first fruit thereof also look at right here just a moment about that but uh anyway so I hope everybody's had it been week keep those in Perth we're still traveling but those that are out will probably have a lot of people out today so all right so we've been talking about this kingdom of God and we want to try and bring it to my analogy today and so last time we left with that the kingdom of God has to be established in you before it can manifest outside because God said quote down here were leading moment but God said I'm in his way of thinking and it just makes sense that's what you know what brother Branham said is that power without character it's a tendon but you can reign but but there's there for example in the physical there's been dictators that have reigned they've had power but it's caused a lot of chaos no satanic Hitler for one you know he had power you know but he had power but it was the you know it was ten so in the in the Christian in the life of a believer it's the same way God is not going to put you to reign it or something if you don't if you can't control yourself you see you don't have power over yourself how are you gonna reign over his kingdom you see so that's I think brother Wang has mentioned this before to have power over this earth first try this earth to have power over it that's what God wants if you can have power but you can't have power over it unless the power is already in use right which is the Holy Ghost the Word of God the kingdom of God all those things are the kingdom right amen so we talked about in Genesis 1:26 where it says and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness right that man was just like God and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that he includes cockroaches that includes worms that includes everything you have dominion over all those things and I know we have dominion over those roaches even today yeah because I'm not gonna crush them you know I can spiders - we have dominion over all those things but that's not that Dominion they was talking about there was no death there right but we don't have Neath the menu no power over or fish of the sea over the birds of the earth that no strict away from us when Adam was and he fell into sin right but that's the power that God wants to bring us back to you see right and then that Genesis 1:26 man Adam had that power can you imagine that you know to have dominion over all the ultra over all the earth sure but we don't know anything that's kind of hard for us to fathom it's kind of hard it's kind of like for us to think that God is always eternal cuz you can your mind can go all the way back you think about that and it's like there's a limitation to your mind but incorrect that's like oh my goodness it's like you go on and you know then that's the same thing but that's what God has written but brother Graham said that when you receive the Holy Ghost when you're born again it's like you're going back to that truck yeah that's right - that Adam Genesis 1:26 amen now all we have to do is we're waiting for that Genesis 1:26 men to manifest on the outsiders right right all right and so brother Brown said that unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him because we have to go through some suffering here on earth you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory that's right that's why that's why God says to them to them that overcome will I give such-and-such right all through in the book of Revelation to them that this but because there's a part of iU to do ma there is a part for the ceilin of Israel that they have to go possess the land that God wasn't just gonna take me better and I'll put him over there now they had to do it to the part but the promise was already there right he's the reason for this that character simply has never made without suffering characters of victory not a gift the man without character cane train because power of art from character is satanic but power with character is fit to rule power with characters patron and since he wants us to share it even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and this set down in his Father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him you know when he raised from the dead and he was ascending he said all power is given unto me both heaven and earth that's the same heart that God wants for you and me to have potentially we already have that in our soul right just waiting for that to be manifested on the outside now so that's why these virtues need to be established in the believers life and after that Kingdom has come into believer in the belief that's right right okay it can't be the other way around some people say you have to climb the stature perform at first then get the Holy Ghost that's wrong because these are all these are all Holy Ghost virtues you have to have the Holy Ghost first and then in order for you to manifest these these these virtues you can manifest them on your own amen you try it there's there's a portion of it that you could do remember the Pharisees had a portion of they had knowledge they had some temperance rally ahead but it wasn't it wasn't Holy Ghost that's right virtue it wasn't Holy Ghost knowledge it wasn't Holy Ghost you see that's right so and I like this picture always like this this particular picture because the head is at the handsome building the body to my right and that's the statue performance right that's the kingdom that's being built it's his his body valuable image now a couple of months ago or several or maybe two years ago I preached the message and up me you bring this up here I have it right here but and then and of course this is just me you know this is just the way whenever I look at this chart III can't help us see in this because this but to me you know this the way this was draw it out to me it looks like it's a body that's laying flat kind of like this you know laying in a casket and and at the end time it's gonna resurrect that's right right when you went when you wake up in the morning what comes up first is the head that's why Jesus Christ had to resurrect first he came up first he was my first fruits of the of the resurrection and then because remember jesus said that the first shall be last and the last shall be first right that's the reason why this is coming up first then everything and everybody else from from F will race race you see I mean you when you get up from your bed your feet don't get up first usually it's it's your head it comes up and then kind of for those that kind of get up a little slowly you know now some of the young people I mean they make they make they make just kind of but so that's just me I'm not making a doctrine out of it or anything like that that's just it's interesting that that was kind of drawn like that you know and it looks like a body that's laying down but in the end time it's gonna all right right into that into that into that full man right there amen praise the Lord that's the kingdom of God that God's interested in it and it's a visit and if the believer has that Holy Ghost in his life that God's own soul in him that's what he's interested in that's why that's why we're that's why I said last week whoever said you don't need these virtues is line because the believer the believer inside desires these women when they born again desirous to have these virtues yesterday and then somebody said well it's not important you know well for one then why did Peter talk about it and - why did brother Brennan preach the whole long service about that man you see but you say he was the messenger at the end time he was the property and time and you just kind of don't look at the annual 70 weeks don't look at but you we don't need that we don't need that we need these things salmon they're not there just to be there right all right so if you remember when Daniel had the the dream about the the statute moon and in that in the in Daniel 2 you can read all about it but in that dream he had a statute and it was it was it was built from the head down to the feet right the gold the silver it represents empires you know and then at the end time the iron and the clay would mix modern powers brethren called the Romanism and understand it at the end time and so but that's how Satan builds his kingdom this kingdom has no foundation that's what was built from the head right down to the feet work but God's kingdom is built from the feet up in the head that's right that's why it stands this kingdom built and that's the reason why Jesus the rock come down if you read that in Daniel 2 comes down hits the feet and it all just crumbles right there is no sure foundation of that that's the reason I'm in Denton just looking at Daniel - you already sees things defeated his kingdom in earth is defeated that's right so I thought that was interesting he hits him in defeat huh he hits him in defeat he hits him in defeat he hits him in divinity in the defeat he's defeated anyway all right so Satan bills is Kingdom with no sure foundation from the head down to the feet that's why it falls apart Christ builds Kingdom from the feet to the thing I'm doing the end time ahead that headstone comes down the body comes up and you see it's odd to me that Christian is ironclad you know that the Roman Empire has you even now we still hold a lot of customs of the Romans you know her oh yeah and and in the end time but this is all this is all spiritual you know so you know this this past Friday just to throw this in my boss at work we caught you called me into the office we were talking about some things about the budget and and he said hey do you see where the Pope said there's no help yeah and apparently the Pope had seen that said no I didn't see that but he said yeah we just need to started to run me some things on fox news and stuff and and there was something where supposedly the the people around the Pope you know that those they are the priests and things they're saying no that's not what the Pope said but the public sayings that that that hell is a place where there's no there's no there's no suffering for the soul there's just the destroying of the soul it's what is what he was saying supposedly and I told I told my boss I said I said well Aaron his name is Aaron I said you know that's actually not far from the truth and he said I he said what do you mean so I said well I said because there is a destruction of the soul I said in order for you to have to suffer in a in a Hell eternally you have to have eternal life and the Bible says that the soul that sinneth it shall surely be destroyed it also says that hell will be thrown into the lake of fire and it will be no more so how can he'll be eternal how can that how can a sinner soul be eternal they has to have the same life that God has and I asked him I said well where's the source of eternal life and he said well God I said how can the Son of God in a sinner have the same source of life but one's burning for eternity and one's with God for eternity and he just kind of looked at it that way when I was in the Baptist Church you know the hell is the eternal place but I mean Hell itself will cease to exist so you know you kind of claim that little seat they're moving emails he was the one that asked all right so this so in Daniel 2:35 when when when when he was Daniel seeing this image that we just looking at he was this says this then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing oats in other words the wind just kind of took the shaft and the wind carried them away that no place was found for that's right there's no there was not going to be any place for these kingdoms they were established here on earth and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain amen that stone as Jesus cried right they became a great mountain and filled the whole earth amen that's why and that's that that stone fits in you a man that kingdom you shall have possession of your whole heart right and in Daniel 2:44 just a few verses down says and in the days of these kings so that God of heaven set up a kingdom now look how it says it says in the days of these kings that means in this time and these days that the Satan was setting up his earthly Kingdom shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom how can that be because he's sitting there sitting in and giving me everything it's it starts God doesn't have to make it big and loud and you know he knows what he's doing he's helped set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the Kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever everybody praise God alright can we read Daniel 7:13 to 27 real quick if you have your Bibles let's turn there I don't know about these things but they think these things excite me give me because you know we're hearing this earth and we just want to get out we wanna you know really when people say I want to get out but really I want to possess this parent the way it was originally meant to be look we're not gonna be up in heaven in a cloud now you know this is our heaven here it just needs to be really a remodel really I'm in Satan's got control over it so Daniel and past the Book of Daniel Daniel chapter 7 starting at verse 13 look what it says here it says I saw this is Daniel speaking now I saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man now where is it that we see something like that later on in the in the Bible right it was in the book of Revelation I saw a one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before him and there was given him Dominion and glory in the kingdom that all people nations and this should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that would that which shall not be destroyed and 5015 I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body and the visions of my head troubled me I came near unto one of them that stood by and asked him the truth of all this so he told me and made me know the interpretation of the things these great beasts which are four are four kings which shall rise out of the earth right because he saw in the vision some beasts as well but the Saints of the Most High listen to this but the Saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever even forever and ever you know here in the Book of Daniel is the only place where where you see that word that that outside of the Bible outside of the New Testament in the Book of Daniel is the only place where it said it mentions the word Saints so that's gotta be me so you have to see yourself in the scripture amen right that's me amen but the Saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever even forever and ever then I would know the truth of the fourth beast which was diverse from all the others exceeding dreadful whose teeth were of iron and his nails of brass which devoured breaking pieces and stamped the residue with his feet of course we know this song represent a religious right of the ten horns that were in his head and of the other which came up and before whom three fell even up that horn that had eyes and a mouth that spake very great things whose look whose look was more stout than his fellows I beheld and the same horn made war with the Saints and prevailed against them so there was that was a particular time where this this Empire and there's a Roman right he made war with the Saints he killed him you know and he had rebelled against him physically here on earth until he verse 22 until the Ancient of came in judgment was given to the Saints of the Most High there's that word Saints again and the time came that the Saints possessed the kingdom amen thus he said the for me shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth which shall be diverse from all kingdoms and shall devour the whole earth and shall tread it down and break it in pieces all right o verse 27 and the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten Kings that shall arise and another shall arise after them and he shall be diverse from the first and he shall subdue three kings and he shall speak great words against the most high and shall wear out the Saints of the Most High and think to change times and laws and they shall be given unto his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time natural know we can go into all the details of that but by the way this mentioned this this goes on to Daniel 17 week - that's right but the judgment shall sit and they shall take away his Dominion to consume and destroy it unto the end and the kingdom and Dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High whose kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and all dominions shall serve and obey Him hitherto so we leave it there so that just shows that the Saints are destined to take over the kingdom that's right all these thinking de me see Washington DC Rome Manila in the Philippines managing Colombia South America all these kingdoms there they're gonna cease one day ever and we're gonna take over the way it was originally but again we take the week with we don't take Cobra if we don't possess our own vessel first all right brother Branham says in the future home God already took up his abode potential all right yes and that new verse soul the kingdom of God is in the earth now right right in the hearts of his Saints it's his attributes that he began in the beginning now his attributes is redeemed even meat now redeem what's he waiting to redeem the earth trying to set his attributes on it I thought we're already on it yeah but we're not on it with full power like it I'd like like Adam had his attributes on it to fulfill exactly his predestinated plan given do you see it yes and then in the Christ mystery of God revealed brother and says then our headship is a kingdom yes hey men the kingdom of God is within you he said the Bible Jesus the kingdom we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom and the Kingdom is is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the Word of God was one yeah and the Word of God is one in his church today if you have that birth in your soul making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last day and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back and restore again as Adam and Eve in the beginning in the Garden of Eden the three full mission of God his body that's all that's all God is interested in the truck his interest is mine interest right should be all that all the interest of the believers to set up this kingdom in full force okay with him being the fool in the head of it all that's right but the thing that stains is that he's not just sitting in a throne in which we're sitting on a throne with you know as well because what Bible says there where Kings increase great amen Manami said that I did say he said it about me so I believe it amen so originally when I started this series I asked the question is the kingdom of God is an external or internal and some of you might have said always entitled but to me the kingdom of God is both I say it's both because it has to begin entirely within you in order to manifest extra because that that's that's the full plan of redemption amen yeah I wasn't just to redeem internally mm-hmm but he wanted to manifest externally as well never know you see see God the Bible says that Jesus Christ when he was living here on earth he was the fullness of the Godhead but that body that he lived in wasn't my team wasn't wasn't it was still it still had headaches it still could it was probably was tempted to think bad things because the Bible says that Jesus was tempted in all things such as we are tempted yes right could have been tempted with with with with with lusting for women and things like that why not but he never sinned yes right that was the thing he conquered all that externa try it but it came from within right man so he was he was it was he was the fullness within yes right we are the fullness within right yes right I mean potentially that's what that's what that's what that's what he is right now even Jesus Christ had to die yes and that body had to be redeemed yes that's right and so as as he came up with power and that bodies redeemed amen then our bodies gonna be real as well madra not a new body right because the same buddy that went down in that drave is the same money they came up a man right it's not it wasn't a different total body no the same thing with you and I Amen we go down in the grave it's gonna be the same one coming out with the truck just fully rid the begging amen lots of lots of looking forward to some things I don't tell off to read with me of dis read with me here he can read it the Lord's Prayer in Matthew 6 verse 9 and I'll read every duh the first person can read verse 10 and we'll just take turns and read the last verse together after this manner therefore pray ye our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name give us this day our daily bread altogether and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever pretty tough babe Daniel had already seen that expecting them was his amen praise God does anybody have any questions or any comments about about anything we talked about amen so their kingdom Saints the kingdom of God isn't just isn't just the external man isn't just about having long hair and about wearing decent clothes and about the Pharisees had all that that's right Pentecostals have done that yeah you know there's more to this than just that those things are important but don't put that before before before the new birth and put that before the scripture before the Bible anything and so it's not just the external say man it's internal in order to start on the outside amen nice about sister truth that's that's very true you know and that that's one thing that you know you have a you get very prideful you know but you know cuz I I can show it on the outside that's fine you can start on the outside but God looks at you inside it know what's in that what's on the inside you know it's what counts right that sees definitely no yeah you read any of the 235 is that New Jerusalem is yeah well that in in there in Revelation in Revelation New Jerusalem the bride types New Jerusalem because the Bible says that in Revelation that that that was it others say when he comes down that city who comes down out of heaven as a brother as a bride adorned waiting for her or her husband and so yeah America just as the glory of God fills the earth but we're sitting on the same throne with hanatronic we filled the whole earth as well do you see what I'm saying yes that's but if that's where you're trying so I mean we're and you think about it this way to you know we're supposed to travel as a thought yes right yes I at that point what limitations can you have there's no limitations if I want to be with with my brothers and sisters or in Africa I can be you know but we had full possession here now me because God entrusted us with it all you know we can be and so we have full possession air with all the earth you know I just kind of see it that way you know but there's some other things involved in there but you know it there's no limitations to what is there limitations to God there's no limitations to us when Louise she got seven overcoming one for each age Revelation chapter 21 there's an eighth Revelation chapter 20 over six that it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and this is when the new City you've done your city to come down I will give unto them visitors back to the water of life freedom he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son that's it that's number eight that's in that that's in the because you got your in the sevens you still got limitation in the sevens of in the that's rather later Joe you got he that overcometh will I give this will I give there's a piece that you get this says all things a man and I will be their God they'll be monkey that's the eighth overcoming I've always found that rope number eight trying to find it but that is up there that's never the city sits down that's because we've received all amen well you look at it also when Christ that when Christ resurrected on the eighth day that's right that's right that's eternal under there that's all power then he said he said all power is given unto me both in heaven and earth because really non eternity is eternity is not gonna happen to let new shitty sits down anywhere that's the eighth everything else is in the seven even the thousand years even the white throne judgment is in time yes the new CD that's great day only begins when God watch everything off killed all the demons puts everybody where they need to go then open the city sets down that's when he says he that overcometh will I give all that let me ask you this good brother brandy said Brown said heaven and earth will come together and that is that that heaven that New Jerusalem comes down inmates could you say that heaviness that New Jerusalem yeah well you go work having a Turkish kissed you go back in the Book of Psalms see that first time happen is when Jesus came to earth heaven what was inside of him on earth the man men that's the way it is now that's a new birth heaven and earth meet so it's not just all on him and it's not just gonna happen in the future like you said this kingdom will never be understood no it's not given with observation the Bible said so in other words you can go observe the United States Constitution Bill of Rights you can understand that government rust you can understand that this government people in your life know they were having never well understanding that is years ago absolutely I mean he's a plan on the purpose he's gonna do this it's a kingdom and that's why I believe was Peter or Paul that said the natural man doesn't understand the things like God right right the natural man thinking about natural kingdoms and about natural things in their life doesn't understand the spiritual things that God because to him it's not it's not revealed to see that's why Pilate kept asking Jesus it they say you're a king you got a kingdom in Kingdom Kingdom and he said but this hand I was born but Pilate knew that that man standing in front of him had no power in the state he was in so he wasn't scared he didn't say kid and he saw ladies don't people come in here all the time telling me they gonna take over look at this cutter you know everybody's left him used to anybody else right but he just didn't say that he the actions of Pilate though brought the kingdom into being as bad to kill Jesus we went out that's right so then did you brought the kingdom that's right but if Pilate would have recognized and we read that scripture where Isis told him and said My Kingdom is not affirmed this month he told Pilate that that's right and he was Pilate was right there looking at the kingdom at the kingdom of God right there couldn't recognize it that's right the natural man does not see even if they are seeing it they don't see it it's right because it has to be revealed amen praise the Lord well the kingdom was established on Friday when they killed Jesus the darkest hour that they thought you know they were getting rid of this heretic but that's when you came to became established today actually but it began he had to diverge that's right so he had to be killed without resurrecting that killing with a man no different that's interesting you said that because I'm gonna see kingdom of God doesn't come it has to be yet there has to be victory there first there has to be suffering right just as Jesus suffered we have to suffer with that ground there of our bit all right that's our bill of rights for payment that's right that gives us the right and Father amen but remember the cornerstone the fountain the foundation is the same thing as the heads are not correct Jesus Christ that's right the whole thing is Jesus Christ us to read in internal-external because we have to take it internally and then we step into it yeah yeah that's true sometimes they say they say the 10-second rule or the truly encounter 5 yeah and before you get to 5 and get out you know hey man as you get older you have to get up in ships anyway Briony is still there I think it already is a resurrection yeah you will but I do still struggle getting up because I just that's not one of my Forte's you know I want to learn how to do it it's more like five hours counting all right with Lord bless y'all Thank You Aaron to be named
