amen hallelujah we're going to try number 288 in the red book and there's some people believing about six o'clock tonight that uh well you know it doesn't matter you know as long as i'm changed and

service and then we'll be having just a sunday morning service and then we'll be eating together there on that sunday so we invite you to come back and be with us just fellowship with us to celebrate us being here 40 years it won't be the exact date but it'll be the the third but that'll be all right just come and be with us all right feeling so ashamed what the preacher said so let's keep believing in god's highways and know that until she's back where she belongs know that there's a victory down the road don't worry she's working on her testimony this could be your story you are praying lord how long what will it take for my child to receive i know god has a plan you've placed it in his hands but it's hard to leave it there and walk away there's a promise to our children the same one he's given no failure is final when god extends his grace but until then just speak and with all your heart know that there's a victory down the road they're working on their testimony you're working on the testimony get everybody up you're supposed to have a special horse come on well i was on a mountain one drink from the fountain when you can see me to this message my glory and when i see him me all around me me my glory razor and we were up in jeffersonville indiana uh years ago probably somewhere about 78 and they had told that they had this uh barge of some kind of gas that that got grounded under the river right there and they were afraid it was going to explode so they told everybody not to have services and they'd come down and told them you know not to have any services and bill paul got said well don't worry about it said if that thing goes off said you'll see the biggest pillar of clouds you've ever seen in your life because the bride is going to beat it up good to see everybody we have a lot of people here today so let's get right on in with it we have a brother from uh haiti that's come over today and i'll just introduce him with brother mario and he and his son is your wish but brother if you will come up and greet the people hey you know this is the reason why god created you that's right you have to give him praise this is the reason you're here tonight give him praise are you here tonight not to be here to assist in the service you are here to do the service for the lord right amen amen because the pews cannot do the service the building cannot do the service because the building is not the church because we are the church he's waiting on us to please him the only reason you're here just to give him praise because the word of god said in the beginning was the word and the word make it flesh because then what is you today because the one is in you because god's spoken god spoken the word and then what got spoken turned to be a human being that even was jesus and everything god was was in jesus and everything jesus was was in you right so there's no reason to be sad there's no reason you don't have affliction today be happy no matter what it is because i'm from haiti because in haiti these days because i have brother thomas in haiti with me and by the dale world was in haiti and then if you see exactly the condition we're living in if you see exactly how you're sitting comfortably here and how we sat over there and that's there's no comparison we don't have to compare because we don't have a building we are taught we have really tense come on states hallelujah not they go to china if they go to haiti that's the way you have to keep it yeah keep it right there and you'll be all right but you heard about six o'clock that'll be a rapture it doesn't matter yeah the morning set we're ready would be happy to go to meet their husband then i'm happy to go to manhattan so amen i've been greeting from our brothers and sisters in haiti uh they pray for you and they ask me to greet you wherever i go because we're here in a mission because i'm a missionary in haiti go to different top of the mountain to the valley go to different places and meet our brothers and sisters but if you could see how the condition they are worshiping the lord and we have i'm not going to be wrong because when the earthquake last year was struck in haiti and we have one of our church that my brothers was praying and the other one they are having service but they brought the building crumble on them and some of them get out but we have it was under the rumble and then after that when though the brothers came and said is there anybody inside they heard they said yes and they managed to push their wrong boutique places and to get all them out when they got out safe in the name god the preacher was preaching because in haiti we don't have electricity in different different parts but we have to do service at three or four o'clock in the afternoon or four o'clock to six o'clock and the earthquake starts about five o'clock so that's when everybody knows it was in church during the earthquake most of them because at the time we have services and then they look at the building open up and then all those other buildings around the church building church all of them crumble i don't think we have that on video but we have that and all the other meeting crumble but the building was open and then it's come back again that's this testimony we have from there and god served him everything has cracked all of her places need to be replaced but god save them and they are very grateful for what god has done there will be peace with the goddess he doesn't need to consult any other person he doesn't need to consult any other ones that you know what to do and i'm glad god did something from the first time at the very beginning and his thought was right he never changed his thoughts god said he's going to create you to be here tonight that was before the foundation of the world look at you you're here tonight amen can i have my son with me but no matter what you could stand up amen i'm so happy to be here and you know me i'm your brothers and then i have to thank the brothers and sisters that receive me here i'm telling you this oh i've been serving just like i was the five stars hotel they've been very good to me the brothers and sisters i met here before oh that's wonderful amen i'm so glad god bless them god bless your pastor always love your pastor because i met him i didn't know him before but i know he's the man of god because i feel exactly the welcome i receive that made me feel at home let's just get on started come on brother tom you're up on the front and reach people god bless you all i'm so happy to be here we had a little flat tire on the way but that was all right we changed it we had all the brothers changing there's like a speed change so that worked out good i'm so very happy to be here today i love the lord with all my heart i'm glad you got to hear brother mario's testimony yeah one of the testimonies of the church that made it was a two-story building right next to it actually fell over onto that church building and the believers were inside and began to cry out and that building righted itself it went directly down and all the believers inside the building were just as white as chalk because of all the rubble and i really i just got back this monday or tuesday morning excuse me and we had a great time in haiti the believers are tremendous it is the same spirit it is uh it is amazing to me that whale and haiti uh poorest country in the world right now but you just look at the believers and they have such order and such love for the lord but beyond those doors of that church it is nothing but a wild wild west it is a very dangerous place it is very ungodly place it is very fast action place and uh but you know it's just amazing what the message is i just can't help but saying i know it's a little bit of a worldly thing but the message rules it just rules it's the most powerful thing to ever hit this earth and to see people who have made such bad and poor decisions in haiti plus combine it with a major earthquake and there's just rubble everywhere and traffic's everywhere and uh you just you just look is there any sanity left and it's so ungodly and and the way they dress the sisters is that women excuse me especially and then you just you go into all that and wonder if you can even make it and you step through the doors of a beautiful tent or a little building that made it and it's just entering into a different world and i just cried like a baby i felt like i was at home and i just love the lord with all my heart there's lots happening in the message of the hour god sent a prophet that prophet was to deliver a word and that word landed right in the hearts of the true believers now those believers are lit on fire with that word and there's nothing that will stop this amen it will be uh according to the prophet of god not a group out in california or wherever they're from it will be according to what the prophet said and i missed everybody and i just can't wait to hear brother jewel preach i know god's just inspiring him and uh i pray for these meetings uh we've got two or three specials but i was hoping uh brother bob parker come on up and just sing a special for us and just love you all and god bless you glad to be back i've seen this little song all week and now i hope i can get it out because when i get in the presence of my brothers and sisters i feel like it's the junkyard dog saved by grace but in the bride of jesus christ amen one day one day i'll be what he wants me to be this whole song's about it's about what we'll do when we get over there it's about what it'll be like and what we'll see what we'll do amen well won't we have a good time can we is oh will be there won't be no uh when we get older oh dance oh amen hallelujah so so if anybody knows oh jesus of jesus if anybody knows jesus i when i was searching when i was struggling to find my place i heard the sweet song sent to me from the throne if anybody knows yes said that ah of jesus is jesus yes everybody amen from college come on up and greet the people thank you you've got to always recognize here the pastors we don't recognize all of the ministers there's a lot of ministers in the building but we always try to recognize all the passions i'll tell you what that'll make you happy that good signing and good testimonies yeah it just does something for you praise the lord talking about that the lord my hand might come at six o'clock this afternoon i had a little had a little sale right before we left lincoln and this morning there's a little black lady come in and she's talking about i hadn't thought about it she said do you really believe you'll be good that the end will come this afternoon i said yes she looked at me shocked her you know i said you know it could come any time you know we just can't put no time to it but i know i said i believe he's already coming crazy amen yeah he said that we'd see him but the world doesn't see him you know i'm so glad today that i see him you know god knows buddies he knows how to protect this dog how's this a little tight with this twitter coming up throughout the christmas with god being before he's even gone how he was going to create things yes had to create him some angels and he had to create him his prophets and great things you know to happen all down to the the great power of god in this great plant and then i he got to talking about what we're here for today you know how god has saved us right here in this very hour that we're living in that he can reveal his self in us to christ the mystery of god amen christ came in the hope of glory praise god i just couldn't hardly set my seat i said oh my you know we could come today

known him for a long time and been amongst him and watched his life and you know always kind of great honor to be in his presence amen been such a blessing to me over the years and i just think about it you might not think we do because i don't want them to come down and minister to us but we just been waiting for we get the people kindly together because i'd love for him to be so hungry when he comes that they'll just have to eat every bit of this word amen praise god i want them to have appetites you know and and be hungry for god's word because i believe god is giving it to us right now

praise the lord i'm kind of home every man to which i had oh shall be that old river oh there's just labor is they're my hopes oh sweet we know that people of the world don't know what we know but see if if the rapture came today it would be three and a half years of time according to my understanding of the prophet's message in the bible because the jews got to get that time let's see they don't understand but we don't make fun of them amen no way you know what they will be a day one day i announced his name i call him perez yes sir god bless you promise he's very i feel very good when i stand up in here and meet everybody here so when i came from the road and i see them they have a festival over here and that's how well it looks like they have a party or something and i say well we have a much better party we have to be in the presence of the lord yes amen and i saw then somebody was dancing and i was thinking well i was thinking only the mexican people dance like that uh i told my wife maybe they have food and everything that they do say well but we will have the better food than anybody else because you have the the perfect food that is the world and well i'm so happy then to be here my name is samuel reyes um for the grace of uh of the lord we are preaching here in gainesville probably four years ago when we begin in there and uh to me it's a big experience to the classroom when we started to preaching you know i remember when my father many years ago told me then one day i died and there was an assistant to a pentecostal church and my father said when when i died they called some brothers to to pray for me and one brother says when he came and said hey brother samuel don't worry about it you don't die because the lord needs you for something well i don't understand nothing because you know it's a support testimony for me when i was child but uh now then i'm i'm preaching right i remember all the time uh that broad says let's pray and i will pray and i'm pretty sure that he will raise from the dead all right and my father says when he finished the pray i wish to stand like this looking for me and when i meet brother samuel dell i can feel the the love of god when i see everybody of you i can feel i love god and uh i'm not prepared for sin but i can sing some something uh if you prefer any spanish or english i like to sing but i don't think i i how wonderful is him yeah when i know then the lord loves to me i don't know nothing about that tongues about that i would try to sing something lost foreign me hello and he wouldn't have to get up and come up here he had a little accident and kind of bummed his shoulder and things up and all but he said just let him sit today yeah you know let him take care of that so we'll give him i'm going to be there amen i may not say nothing amen trying to pick out all of the ministers and then we'll get brother longor to be last you know because he's not the least but he'll be last okay let brother padgett's people come and sing okay amen amen brother sisters right thank you thank you when i'm down my oh now i can't see the sun with my head to the ground my when i'm down my troubles way my troubles my troubles oh my troubles my troubles yes amen i was thinking about what the prophet said about uh the roman soldier that when jesus was brought forth amen you know he was crucified and he was hanging on the tree there but a roman soldier was having a very you know a deadly spear the brother go call it a sin spear so he came and he struggled inside of jesus christ and i see the results of it today amen amen the spirit of god when the spirit was used i think the man stabbed the side of jesus so hard and then the blood of jesus god shouted and began to spray what that's what the prophet said and he said the blood began to go shh and you see some of the blood went to heaven amen amen and you see all over the world nigeria and god is calling everybody amen amen there's power in the blood of jesus and i i was praying uh god gave me a scripture in first king chapter three and i read it because i've been reading that scripture since when i was a little boy and um by the women the two women with a dead child and living in childhood came before solomon and when they came with it with a living child not a dead child amen the no witness at all and i said lord what does it mean in this scripture all right jesus i prayed for god to open it up for me more on monday and this morning i open it up again and i see the spirit of god come down and open it up even more i see exactly what it probably said about the two churches the the natural church the common church and the spiritual i see these two women all of them all of them were sins amen the bible says it will help stay amen yeah and these two before a great king and this cain had a discernment amen yeah right from the face of the problem you could have just said this baby belongs but he said bring me the sword amen so i believe that this is a time that the king is using the sword and this sword is a word and it's and um as the spirit of god was even giving me more understanding i see this woman the first woman the bible said she overlaid on her child amen was she alive yeah amen she concluded it beautiful story and gave it but that was a lie and you see the denominational lies all different planes even though i know girl can come anytime he could come tonight at 6 00 p.m oh yeah harold campaign said he made his big story the whole world another group of pentecostals or whatever churches they also celebrating um the rachel party but here we are in the house of the lord tonight amen standing before the king and the king giving us the favor amen come on yes amen amen so i believe that tonight my heart rejoice and your heart rejoice because of the blood of jesus you have spread around the world and bringing us together so i'm just happy tonight to be here in the house of the lord amen amen i have um my little boy um they want to sing danny and jose john joseph once thank you so you want to sing johnny mary will come and then honor group will also come later amen i just appreciate brother therefore having us here let's see brother calvin and all the great man of god here i'm happy amen praise god amen amen bro okay amen all the musicians who have their place oh lord we praise you oh oh oh oh um post savior precious rescue the souls of men oh you rescue the souls oh you are the one that we praise you always longer faithfully loving your own hearing a weakness you find us falling before you are the one that we bring hearts always hunger you are the one we all know we hallelujah always hunger hearts always hunger we got all of the ministries except brother lundgren right now i'm talking about pastors okay we know there's a lot of ministers among us and if we would let's just have all the ministers stand all of you know there is ministers among us but are not pastors you know you know we appreciate you coming being with and do it as a us but a homer come on if we miss any pastor you make sure you let me know amen well he's talking about that uh the end of the time it did end for somebody today that's right he amen you know and one thing about it is brother rem sitters he's coming three times and then last time he said the bride goes up he comes to get that bride there's any amen so we ain't got no problem with that you know so uh you know but one day thank god he is coming that's right amen we appreciate the lord amen and i appreciate all of you i mean good crowd amen amen we appreciate that and i thought about you know as uh brothers were talking about you know what god's done this hour you know but what he's doing amen you know brother i'm talking about you know god sent his son yes yes right all right he saved the world no then he wasn't a prophet right he wouldn't work but he couldn't stop there that's right he had to have some actors that's right i said you're the actor yeah amen there has to be an actor on the scene somebody to take out this word he matters what's been saying so somebody's got to act this thing out right now they got the script you know like a movie actor they send a certain script to amen to certain people that's right right amen and they say well this fits you right amen i believe you can do it that's the reason he sent prophets and teachers and evangelists and pastors you can do this you can do this and then he had to have a people amen to enjoy that that's right amen to that people amen is not just not part of that ministry but they're part of the body and to enjoy what's being acted out that's right that's true you've got so many television stations amen there's people out there that's not actors but

my heart i want to see pour out your power of jesus christ i just want to say i thank the lord this evening for being this servant with you it's been some time uh i just count brother sam and fidel and they just been real they've been real friends you know it's different when you're some people you made in life and they become your friend yes right brother brother sam being a real friend he's a real father image and you've been around here just like i never had a father so when i see somebody that got that kind of anointing i really respect it he's a real father not only that he's a pastor so i appreciate him giving this opportunity to be here i got a lot of great preachers here man i hear brother holmes and after his you know he really i can tell he was ready to get started i said don't let him preach and i appreciate my wife being with me this the day is her birthday she spent a birthday so she asked me hopefully maybe in the morning i have a sing a song for you to praise god but i'm not going to keep you you know my style they call me the helicopter preacher and if you get that tighter you got to live up to it so when i get ready to stop i'm gonna go up when i come down i'm just gonna come down and stop so you'd be just like to say hang on for the ride i told the other night i'll preach behind a pastor i said pastor's airplane he need a runway to get going and i said you know when the difference between the helicopter and the airplane the the airplane had to get per minima of buildup or a build up speed to take it off the ground i think 170 miles an hour they take the lift of 747 off the ground and and when it he had to get that speed up and then when he get ready to land our airplane had to break the speed he had to pull they had to break it back so that they could land the plane i say that when you're bouncing preaching you think when he gonna land you see him coming in but he ain't landing yet but a helicopter it goes up with the same amount of speed that the helicopter go up where it lands with the same amount as me they don't have to break the speed to land so when i when i get ready and i'm just gonna land so if you got your bibles this evening i'm gonna go to the word of god and i'll read from the book of saint john the 15th chapter and i'm gonna read from the book of first john the second chapter and i'm gonna begin reading in the book of saint john the 15th chapter and i'm gonna begin reading that verse four down through verse seven saint john the fifteenth chapter verse four and read like this abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more kanye except everybody me i am the vine and they are the branches he that body in me and i in him the same bring forth much fruit for without me can we about me yay can't do what so don't get the big head how do you need god for everything all right i think we all need him without me he can do nothing right if a man body not in me he is cast forth as a branch and with it away and means gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burnt if you abide in me and my words abide in you yeah ask what you will and it shall be done unto you let us go to first john the back of the bible to the second chapter in first john the second chapter i'm going to read a verse from there i'm going to read from verse 27 it says ii chapter first john verse 27 but the anointing which you have received of him abided work in you show you in other words abide in you and you ain't need nothing that any man teach you right but as that same anointing teach you all things and it is true and is no lie even as it has taught you you shall abide in him amen a gracious father one more time help me to yield my mind my body my spirit to you god my soul father help me to surrender myself completely over to your spirit yes lord of god as you go after these few minutes god give us grace and mercy to speak your word father yes now father god touch someone that need touch heal someone that needs healing god break a depression any spirit that will try to bind a whole we ask you in the name of jesus christ to take full control of this service we actually in the name of our lord jesus christ amen you may be seated one moment thank the lord for the reading of the word of god deceiving you amen amen if you ain't abiding in me he said am i worried about it in you ask what you will how did it shall and if i had a title i would use this title this uh evening abiding in the realm of anointing all right right about it in the realm of anointing because we realize that in the book of first john and the second chapter said i need it it needs nothing any man teach you right now i mean where is the anointing that god sent to teach you how many numbers not only will this anointing how did it be on you but he said it will be in you honey so we begin to look at these things so we got to begin to really abide in the anointing uh i find it in the realm of anointing what do you abide me it means to contain it means to dwell it means to him do it it means to stand and in a way if god is in me i will endure i do i will be able to stand it because there will be a continue that we abide in the anointing of god how did we go we realized here what did the brother come to do he come to bring us back to the word so we can find our place where we come from how do you know the word we got to know what kind of lord in this ownership here he says here he says he's in the church his head he's in it the church is heading himself up with the word because he can not only he only come to the word he is the word the word cannot the word cannot come to a alone whatever the word is if it won't fit so the word has to come to the word yet abide in me and my words in you man should not live about bread alone another quote here for the world is falling apart he just he said when we get get away from the word then we'll we're getting away from god jesus said if you abide in me he said that is the mystery i need another word he was trying to get the people to see it ain't about how good you are and he's about how much power you got it's in the world and my words and you didn't didn't ask what you will see see it see the idea is god's word has got to be abiding here so he would tell them that the word how did he say if the word abide in you and if you abide in the word he said then you can because he says here that is the secret how do you deal with the power lace honey when you find out what you ain't in the word that would give you authority over the devil because jesus knew his position in the word he knew his position in the word and because he knew his position in the word he had power over the devil in other words how do we know when we abide in god the point of it is the thing that is ordered abide in god you gotta have the ability to hear the word first of all it's starting with the ability to hear the word how did everybody come to church everybody ever heard the message don't mean they heard the word amen yeah the ability to hear the word so that abiding is based on the ability to hear the word and then the only way you can hear the word you got to be a spirit-filled man he said right here in the midst of it he's the worst in faith expressing he said now he begin to i got the wrong one excuse me i'm sorry yeah he said right here in the messenger in the surrounding my test uh saw this church in he said he's an evil edge he's an average we he's a to every age we hear the same truth right he that has an error let him hear what the spirit is saying to the churches but only a spirit-filled man can't hear the revelation of that it ain't just hearing the magic it ain't just hear somebody say jesus but somebody they gotta anoint you to recognize what god is doing for this day you know what we say here i i hear i've been hearing the saying about it hey god predicted that rapture to take place about six o'clock and i'm gonna tell my friend it's already wrong the rapture already took place honey how did something on the inside of you when you recognize this word get eagle food how did you already part of what god you're a part of god planned how many shall we we must have our earth in here amen yeah now see when i say it everyone can't hear them i'm gonna bag that about scripture and you know what you said brother became a new book he was able to take this bible and find himself in it you can't find yourself in the word of god so we got to look at here i see the ability to hear you've got to have the ability to hear the word in order to abide in him that means to continue continue holy know how you're not going to let go the world is continuing dwelling in me i don't care what the devil tried to say i don't care what kevin sugar said i'm up again the word will never leave you over save you it will never take you nowhere it cannot keep you i am abiding amen hey just look at this thing right here i'm never going to read a few verses here i'm not going to be long today i'm going to sell you anything i'm going to parachute out so here so here we go john 6 and i'm going to begin reading it saint john 6 and i'm going to begin reading that verse 65 saint john verse 65 and he began to hear the same time and we know the stone right here over jesus speaking to the disciple i was unbelievable but at the 65th verse jesus said like the 65th verse he said he said and and he said therefore i say unto you that what no man can come unto me except he was giving up him all about what happened sometimes we come across revelation we might not understand it but we don't give up we don't quit on god we don't turn back on god when we look at things and see like it ain't going the way that we thought it ought to go i still hold on to the word and the world is falling apart i don't understand it but i know that god is real yeah and he said what he said from that time that's right how did he quit about it from that time something stopped there from continuing on something stop never going all the way with god if you can explain it you don't need faith faith is a revelation of the will of god it must be revealed to you how did many of his disciples walked back however what it is he said my spirit has no pleasure in them to draw back here he was going forward abiding in the word honey but the word came how did the word begin to reveal itself and they did not keep following the word they did not keep us abiding in the word they turned from the word and walked backwards steady going forward other people god did not call up the banker he called us to keep pressing up he calling to take the land how many people are gonna tying the bag up and the time to make them feel violent i'm gonna go all the way with god honey he says from that time right now yeah why must have been time creatures they must have been dwelling in time all right because here's a lot of them with time from that time honey they must have had a plan that they were going to be removed from the book right from that time they might have been going to church praying in god and having a good time but something separated them it was not because they were drinking bubbles and shooting drugs once every day they could not stay with the word they could not stay with the word he said from that time many of the disciples went back and walked no more with him in other words god scrapped the name of the book they just happened to be saint john 666 they just happened to follow him if you yeah 67 yes 67 bro jesus said that to them will you also go right oh man that's abiding in the word now how you are being the god of words down on the inside of him he's not going to let go how did he not gonna back up and then and then he said right here and then simon peter ever said lord how he called him by his right title lord why because the lord is my shepherd i shall not walk i need god god has sacrificed from my heart i the lord is in protection other people say lord yes when that name is always really mentioned in the bible and always get jesus attention to whom shall we go that has the worst of eternal life honey i don't tell you what i'm gonna stay with this i'm gonna hold on to what your word said i don't understand it neither but i know one thing you ought to live in word how did he say it very good peter said not only this i'm not just serving this thing because i read about it or because somebody talked about it but he sounds in this thing because i know this is real yeah amen and then he says right in the 20 to 69 verse and we believe and are sure amen if you ain't sure you ain't going to keep a body when you're not and let it keep abiding in me i mean i ever gonna be i receive a new body i gotta believe it and we are sure that the other christ the son of the living god and jesus jesus knew who he was before you could ever go backwards do you got to lead the world how did what did he do adam's he told adam to stay with the word abide in the word if adam would have stayed with the word deity was in him hallelujah as long as adam stayed with the word he could say to this mountain to me that i moved and the mountain had to obey him how did the most he stay with the world he could speak squirreled into existence lord he stayed with the word god had the power in him but he couldn't give he he didn't work something turned him away from the word yeah and when he did it he's lost his ability no longer could he do these things again how do you know why you're the father being the rapture joshua did not receive power because he was a good man joshua's received power because he stayed with the world he took the prophet message and put sin on it he took the message and put it behind when he called joshua he said these things he said judging one says him he said foot and the eighth verse said the book of the law shall not depart from work that's right i've got mouth yeah i need the word of god and not unto thy mouth out of your own mouth you speak life or you speak down right i mean out in your own in the holy ghost he wants you to walk around and talk about all your weary and all your complaining and every time that that will do something to you he wants you to go around oh wow yeah oh the devil down this street and the devil why you don't want you to get that word on this side of you i'm not gonna let the devil turn me back i'm not gonna let the devil make me give up i'm gonna stay in that word received to do to do according to all that is written therein and therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and thy shall die shall have good success amen have not i command thee be strong and have a good courage yeah be not afraid amen you need to be dismayed for the lord not god is with thee whatsoever the power was standing in the word the power was standing in the book of power repeat the book joshua has it and keep speaking the word until you overcome this deal i'm calling you for this job hey yeah he said well i'm going i'm in this mission and everything's going wrong hey you managed to get back to the world because i would make your way possible i live in another world whenever things is going wrong around you i knew when the world is falling apart highly i seen the ravens defeat you i didn't win it it felt like you ain't got that to come to church i'll make a way out of no way i'll make sure that that won't be possible either you don't have to feel what's coming up on the earth i got you in the hall of jail the trouble i will hide you other people we don't have to worry about these lies and then we got to come to another thing we got to do another thing in here and we're going to abide with god and then we're going to stay with the word we got to completely surrender ourselves to it honestly the reason people ain't the power ain't moving how do the power of the world move they don't surrender everybody want the more you can get out of the way the more you decrease the more that he could increase oh yeah the surrendering paul we got to come to that point people we've got to surrender everything that we got to god we got this word say about that he would abide and we abide in his word and his word abide in us if we ask what we will honey god through him he was so completely he was completely he was so completely to surrender to the word and god of god until he and the word was the same that exactly what the church ought to be today the word that word of god is the same under the church not only jesus amen brothers like the brothers just saying here how do you get it it's the action part now everybody said well god's going to do it don't cause it i'm waiting on my body yes did they not go all the way when they come out when jesus come on the scene her here they was coming out in saint john 8 had the claims in the word right that they'd be abraham siege they had to claim they was abraham would it be out of abraham but they couldn't stay with the word right how do you know what was wrong they could not hear right they didn't have the ability to hear from god if you know something people if you could hear the word of god you ought to say blessed are my ears everybody to come to everybody here don't know who he's talking about right honey didn't anywhere so that saint john jesus began to deal with the spirit how do you because they didn't stay with the word they stayed with what the church said but they understand what the world was saying all right we're gonna say john say journey i'm just running through these real quick ted bear with me you say here he said well brother why are you taking the bible because when i got this when the seals over my life would become a new book i'm not going to give up if you ain't continuing my word and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free if they could tell you in my word they should know the truth amen i said that that your make us free and jesus after they said that said unto them i say unto you whosoever sinned is is the servant of satan if ye are in a servant body right how does the servant body not right honey god servant can be moved a servant he don't know what's going on in the bride chamber he's going to serve everybody not in the house but forever but the son of fighting foreign wait what happened i'm going to be identified with my father hallelujah i stayed up in that wreath and ruler i mean now i'm part of the part there was something on the inside of him they could call him back to hear the word of god hallelujah was something on the inside of him even though he went down this road i think he had a spiritual gps on this out here put him right back in line with the words i began to go into him and i began to think on this day we don't stay with the word i said you know him that's why we don't stay with the word i what do we do to get away from the word i'm beginning to look at this thing because i'm beginning to want to hear them as i begin to study this visit why the people they stand with the message well i'm abiding in the message how do you see them next two weeks after they come they've got prayer for the healing they got prayed for the olympics and next two weeks later why was he wasn't yeah oh yeah i got prayer for the other night to get the holy ghost i don't think i got it when you don't because if you had it you wouldn't be talking like that if you had it the devil can't make you doubt who you are the devil can make you change your confession you ain't got the holy and that way we gotta stay with that confession in other words if you're gonna abide in god you gotta keep your word you got to keep your confession the same all the time how do you got to keep saying the same thing all the time you say you know you're not saying if you're going into the rapture you got to believe it and you got to believe it all time you can't believe it hey when the first time you the devil hit you an eye on wildly while you would uh i ain't good enough for the rapture when you're not good enough you're never able to make a circumstance change your confession the devil is able to put something in your way that'll make you change your compassion i know if you got a confession in the holy ghost i don't care what come your way every time you come out you hold your head and you pray all right i don't let the devil turn you around i probably really preach a minute who is god he said he said when the inspiration in the holy spirit is here to inspire you remember god will make you come into your confession if you say i'm a drunk and i want to drink you're not wearing soon you'll be won and then you say if you say i'm a sinner and i want to sing you be you'll be right into it if you say i'm a christian oh yeah i'm gonna abide in the world because every day i don't feel like a christian every time i turn around i don't feel like a christian i don't feel like i'm a son of god but i'm not going to let the devil change my debate how do you know i'm a son of god not because i feel like i want yeah amen do you feel like you're a christian faithful no do you believe you're christian i don't and i believe it all alone god will bring your testimony he will he'll bring it to you we'll bring you right into it if you say i believe in healing i believe in healing not in feelings we got healings and feelings mixed up it's a bit different than the definition i believe in feelings no i believe in healing how did that mean if i feel like i'm here if i don't feel like a hip it don't change my confession about and believe that god has healed you confess that and god will make your body obey your confession i'm gonna stay with the world i'm gonna stay with the world holly i don't care what the devil trying to say you need to stay with the word why because we find out that the word ain't got no fault in it why it's so important to stay with the word because the word they've been proven to take the test ain't got no fault in how do you know if i stay with the word then i have the power only i have my body will come subject to release the power from my divine healing that prophecy god say you look at your new body and you don't let the devil change your convention i see me a whale body and i'm walking toward it i gotta give his high blood pressure i don't care but without baby i don't care this castle look toward their body i remember god came to zechariah and the bible when his white people receive a baby what did you do god had to shed his mouth right how did god had to shed his mouth because the main confession was i can't believe this i got to him you got to figure this out it wasn't nothing to figure out it would neither accept it or undoubtedly exactly but god can handle that priest going around preaching that god can't do nothing to his around the mouth because zechariah failed to buy with his convention he failed to stay with the word but when he came to mary hollywood he came to mary yeah honey had to marry with thoroughly after christ fully revealed himself to her mary said to him being unto me according did i work what did she have she didn't have a sensation she didn't have a feeling because i begin to realize there's no fault in him no there's no fault in him no anyway there's no death in him however there's no death there's no fault in jesus so it's very important to value him because if we guided him does that mean every demon is subject ever demon and powers he said if you notice that way he's preaching the church in the book i'm paid 15 to 16. he said if the bride ever gets a true revelation that she can do the greater work hardly if she ever gets the true revelation greatest he that's in me and he lives in the world he said the devil will be powerless true revelation not me no i got plenty of fault but we need a sacrifice without fault we need somebody that was worthy without vote how long should we realize here should we realize if she ever gets a true revelation or who here let's just see what kind of anointing that was on him i think you don't have to turn all these i'm just jumping through these real quick this ain't a sunday morning so i'm not gonna try to preach it like a sunday morning so i'm gonna i'm gonna jump through here and i'm gonna come over here we need to know what kind of knowing that was on him yeah hey if i'm if the devil got me down and beat down and i'm sick and the devil won't leave i gotta know what kind of anointing there's on me i gotta know what kind of anointing that's in the word how did it get either the sickness got power over me and the sickness is greater than god or god is greater than the sickness if god is greater than any servant said and come my way oh brother i feel like even though no i'm not giving up inside of me let's say that my god amen and they'll begin to look at him begin to realize the word the word got to be more powerful than any sugars that we come up against anything actually acts 10 screaming thank god i tried to trump acts 10 and verse 38 and he began to hear i'm talking about the naughty who had an anointing that's in this word you say brother jewel the demons bother me but you gotta hold on to this yeah you gotta take this anointed word how do you know the word you see by revelation this bible made jesus come real to you heaven the prophet was trying to do he was trying to take the person of jesus christ and make it real to you so the bride would know her make the revealed word how did people we're not preaching a book we're preaching a person i mean jesus christ the person of revelation to you and i honestly will you give a quick good understanding of who jesus christ is you know you're born again if you don't know where you are that they share the same and share the same in their meaning and the greek movements mean continue what would mean to stand i need another word so that means if i'm gonna abide in god when i come up to a circumstance i don't know what to do god how the anointing of jesus in that realm with the holy ghost and with power went and about doing good and healing all that were oppressed for god was with him right amen so now i understand if i'm getting a revelation of this word that everybody that was oppressed everybody that was obsessed with god came forth that demons had to leave that's right so that's important for me to stay with the world that ain't going to fall in for all right we find in this man called jesus my faith is holding on to that right now hey let this word begin to unfold i find no fault in this man in jesus name how do he stood the test how did he stood the word there he didn't come with sensation he didn't come by feeling he came by the spoken word he stepped into his own word in the beginning he was a word and he came down without sin that's right that's right we take us over what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of jesus yeah i hope you're not just saying that because you read it in a book i hope you're saying it because you know it's real i'm serving a word that has no fault in it i'm saying the word ain't got nobody to say he didn't do he did this oh he made this mistake jesus didn't have a password but when you come to the blood of jesus christ what the first thing he do he drop your knee he dropped me in him he dropped you in the blink why are you talking in the belief because he gotta do away with your past life so when god look at you he standing there justified no you never did it in the first place to himself how did the word was made flesh it was there how did he took the book himself yeah amen without sin he was the only one that could take my place now he didn't have no sin i died how good they are because they are not good enough i want them to look at it right now that i am the one that i am the one that healed them he became our sins he kept our sins upon him how do you so we can so we can so we can handle this covenant and if jesus did not go to gather for himself he went to gethsemane for me did he want to go no no no he tried to get out of this yes but he had to abide in the world that you've got to go jesus tried to get out of it he went three times in prayer all right that's right that body did not want to die what jesus was doing why didn't he want he knew that to go to gethsemane to go to calvary people have to separate from god he knew that for him to die as a sinner remember jesus couldn't die right here jesus wouldn't have been able to die because the eternal spirit that was in him was god and jesus knew that he won't have to have to totally submit himself to that have to submit himself to the plan of god i know why you think he struggled he went to gas shipping because he knew it would be a separation because god came fellowship with them he knew the death that was on him he knew he was just going to be a tooth that he got to deal with he's going to deal with pain that you're going to be so bad we're going to be so crucial that no man can burn all right that's right that's right he took the saviors of the world and he went to gethsemane for me yeah and at the end of the day he says lord and they begin to realize he got to go all the way he got to stay with the words he said lord not my will yeah it's over i'm totally surrendering right now i'm surrendering all my rights to you not my will but that will be done yes disney when they came and got to me was over there that's right he was standing there with all the pain every cigarette i smoked every needle i took ever any more act out of practice he was driving him in the country he had me on his mind because he was not a sinner he became sin he became the sins of the world how did he took the sins of the world and what he did because he took this up on him he was beats he beat somebody they took the crowns and they crowned them with the thorn of the curse a thorn being cursed that lays on the ground they put the creps up on his head and dug it in how did they tuck and beat his body in such agony and shut the pain and shut i pulled his arms out of joy pulled his legs out of joint i didn't know the way he was doing this for me he was doing it for you honey you're gonna have your faith that my brother really was jesus christ they're saying yesterday good day everybody to believe it get on me you need that they gave jesus he should have died for a longer blood that beating that he had he should have died but jesus said no man take my yeah life they have evidence right it was already spoken yeah i have power yeah the right that i'll be laying down that's right they didn't kill jesus and as he was going here i was on his mind all i need to do is recognize what he done amen for me i need a personal savior i need to know how dear he is to me you say well i went to church all my life they don't mean nothing i'll accept you recognize what he done for you cause you might not have a chance to go to church just like the thieves didn't have a chance how did the thief on the cross didn't have a the chance chance he had was to recognize that that man is dying in my place and i'm putting my faith in him because i don't see it in him we gotta get our mind on myself all he did a man didn't go to church man didn't pay tithes he didn't do nothing but at the end of the day he recognized that that man is bleeding that man is shaking and bones his bones has just been pulled out of joint he's hanging on the cross the pain that he was in that man was dying for him all right he even said it it don't work he said we deserve what we get right but this man hasn't done nothing what gave him that revelation he recognized who he was but at the end of the day something came real yeah how much confession how much action yeah commercial yeah he's dying in my place this man does nothing we deserve what we get and this man turned to jesus and the blood running across jesus how many pearl phrases maybe he said lord i drunk all my life he recognized his psychonics he recognized that he would die for him jesus turned around and prophesied god said the lord that what he was saying god said the lord dang you won't be with me in paradise i claim you right now i'm planning for you when you're right grave in hell because jesus couldn't have went to hell except sin was saying the only thing could have went there and been judged our sins went to hell with the promise no man take my life i got power to lay down i got power to raise it up so you would say hell came home jesus stepped down in hell the demons realized oh we don't made a mistake this time we have bloated hallelujah because they knew he was standing there they thought how did they have covered him but they didn't realize i want you to know that the devil is powerless oh he is a big bad i'm going with no errors and trying to block you out of your face trying to make you change your confession right and he come up through paradise those saints was in there waiting on the revelation yeah he come up through paradise he stopped in paradise joshua hold on guys sitting there waiting on he had to unlock him how did it unlock the girls so they could come up now the body connects to the the head and the body connect on the eastern one and the grave over the head come through the two and the body followed it they begin to pray to people all over the city i need a resurrection but not only did he

got too many votes well i'm gonna tell you what if everybody look that way everybody got that problem amen so we gotta have some work on our faith now we gotta have someone we can take hold of and accept 1958 brother brown said sometime ago across central america here there was a minister by the name of daniel greenfield and he went to sleep one night and he dreamed and he dreamed that he died and he was taken up to the gates of paradise and when he knocked at the door the doorkeeper came and said who art thou that desires to enter these gates hey look at these big shots yeah i've been in this method for years buddy man i haven't been on the missionary field here hallelujah oh yes i mean i've been good i didn't get my food i had the po i got all this but listen if you answer this question i know that's right he said i'm danny greenfield and i'm the american evangelist hey i said lord don't let me get proud keep me humble he said just a moment sir i'll see if i can find any record of you here he came back and said there's no record here of you and there's no record that's the best shape i always say there must be something wrong surely my record is there no there's no record here so well what shall i do say there's only one thing that you can do if you wish you can appeal your case to the white throne judgment call buddy oh i want to tell you something people come on i haven't been in the corner no i'm gonna be in trouble now one thing that you don't want to do is build it to supreme gordon if you got a misdemeanor i had a friend the guy shot this man shot the man was shot he was in the room and then he got up and said i'll peel i'm going to the higher court yeah he did they gave him two euros then he got 10 flat one thing you don't want to do with pillars that's right you can appeal your case to the white throne judgment if you wish to appeal your case he said well if that's all i can do i'll do it so he said he began to move out through space that it seemed like sometime he traveled just in space and after a while he came into where it began to be light lighter lighter and the lighter it got the slower he began to move and finally right in the center of the light he stopped stopped right in the presence right it's not the pure death right hallelujah where will we be at a run today who will we be in the heart we're standing in front of a mighty guard right who he was there was no certain place it was coming from but just all around him with extreme light just many times stronger and brighter than the sun and he said he looked around and after a while he a great deep voice said who art thou that standing before my judgment and he said i'm daniel greenfield the american evangelist i came to the gates of paradise and was asked to come to your judgment scene to have my case pleaded said the voice came back and said very well daniel greenfield i will try you at my judgments that's right and he says i have a law that you must be tried by said daniel greenfield did you ever tell a lie while you were on earth i wish i could say that i had never told a lot you don't know white lie you know little things that we feel like lily's holy lives the devil triggers you there ain't no there ain't no holy love a lot another word another word everybody got some little thing that they let slip by all right you know about it you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna tell this real quick i i brought her i brought her brother home i brought a crossbow nobody didn't need no brother but me and the guy i'm gone i was about to make it home nobody would have never knew this and my wife asked me wonder why women don't know there was no reason for her to ask me for that there was no reason she gonna make me tell her something i shouldn't have told her because if i could have only sneaked it in the room she would have never knew i had it because she wouldn't know i don't know what guns and things is and bowls and things she don't care about if i could have just sneaked it in the room and i was almost there and she says what you got now when the man get busted a man can't take this and then the next question i didn't want him to ask how much did you give her see that was gonna scream me just to go on the edge so i said it real fast i said a hundred dollars i did give 100 but i didn't put the plus to it yeah you know when you don't you know what to me now i'm justifying this yeah because i'm saying a hundred dollars you got to say it real fast you're gonna confuse the woman you cannot be studied but then i said well i thought when i put it in my room i said it's over with i don't have to face that no more the next day the next day the very next day she says what'd you say you gave me that boat evidently she didn't believe me cause she had no reason to ask me a second time when i told him what i gave him so and this time when a man gets busted he always shows his authority so this time i had to be aggressive because i didn't want him to ask me that never again and i looked at her like the next day she asked me again man i wanted to confess to this room now so when the man get busted we always get attitude you know what i mean all right yeah i can't three on the dog football i knew you were lying oh yeah she had me there you don't want her to catch you in a lot she only got it over here that's right but i tried to make it right and i tried to justify it but i knew it was a lie right now the most humbling experience i'm gonna have to do it and go down and look at my wife which was right for the verse and about how it says honey i want you to forgive me i'm not home right step on the back side of the house i don't get where he was he was standing in the yard here if you're in the yard you're still paying rent on it how do you stand here and then we're showing our lives a lot when you go down in the prep little things that we don't make right the boats are little foxes said daniel greenfield have you ever told a lie while you were on earth he said i thought i'd been a truthful man but in the presence of that light he said i've seen a lot of things that i had said that wasn't right and he said yes lord i lied he said daniel greenfield did you ever steal oh come short you've been guilty of stealing time that you shouldn't give to god we all got something we need to do when you're standing before god i mean a lot of stuff come out that you should know that you thought were little crooked deals you stole something you stole somebody trust you stole this it's all same spirit that's right he said daniel greenfield did you ever steal while you're on earth and he said if anything i thought i'd been i'd been honest but he said in the presence of that great light i've seen a mini a little shaky deal that i thought you let me borrow that money i'll pay you back next week don't see you for two years that's a shaky deal you know people get your money but when you get your money they quit speaking to your church you got some problems yeah right okay and at the end here he said he said father truly daniel greenfield wasn't perfect in his life but here's one thing that daniel greenfield did while he was on earth he stood for me and now i'll stand for him that's what you want you god bless you hello touching jesus that's all that's my man god bless you touching jesus may god bless you as i get ready amen jesus somebody needs you to believe it me and a blood vessel busted in his arm now humanly speaking i'm just a man and he brothers is just a man but what god said put two or three abiding in his word and attaching and grin to any one promise right now oh amen right else me oh and he wanted him to claim him he wanted him to go around and testify i got back trouble i knew and then what he wanted him to do glory to him but jesus put in his words he didn't say what it was he lived up by my stripes he didn't say the word of god is here they hallelujah we are oh is oh oh hey we don't need a negative confession amen there's not a negative confession in god anywhere he said all is well yeah that's what he's saying amen and everything ready all right
