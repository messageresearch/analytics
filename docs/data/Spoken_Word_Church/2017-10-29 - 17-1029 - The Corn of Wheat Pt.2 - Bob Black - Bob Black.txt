TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all right we're recorded I see so why I passed around that little corner wheat does everybody know why that's significant we're doing another job needs me for a minute I know all right there's a whole lot of parables in the Bible based on terrorism so that the corner weed is important because in this last day we're returning back to the original word the same word that was planted back when Jesus gave his life rose from the dead they play on the church at Pentecost and we're returning back to that same word where it's not it's not anything Harvard the same original word and we know that the church has grown as the word was eaten down to the seven churches through through man's ideas and started at nothing then I see in church where Constantine came in with his great robes and began to sway the people away from the original word and offered him land and things and and popularity showed them supernatural signs he said he saw a cross in the sky and all these four things that got the people's eyes off of the original Word and they began to look at other things that brother Ram talked about in the messages till harvest time where he laid out Satan schemes the same schemes that he used in the Garden of Eden they used with Constantine and he's using today to try to get people's minds off of the original order he uses the supernatural the things like that giving people a position in the church the same thing that Constantine did I'll make you a presbytery round make you a deacon I'll make you somebody big and and instead of relying on the power of God in his in his word people began to look at at that kind of thing supernatural evidences and and and anything that would deviate away from the original word but the Bible says and Joel that God would restore I will restore saith the Lord that he would send a message through and through a restorative ministry through Martin Luther and John Wesley and then my message and where the homeless himself came at Pentecost and began to restore the gifts back in the church but then finally in the last day God would send a prophet with the headstone I've had stolen message to restore all the distrained everything back in the church so that the church would be prepared for the headstone to come down there wouldn't be one word off the the church the bride will be restored all the way back to the original seat but to know what to know what the corn of wheat looks like you got to know what the original corn of wheat looks like I tried and their original corn of wheat was Jesus Christ and the fullness he was the fullness of the Godhead Bobby all wrapped up always would say like this bottled up within that man and everything that makes God God was bottled up in that man because that's who he was now that was the original corn of wheat that's gonna be the corn of wheat in this day because in in the bride God will put himself the fullness of the Godhead falling back into the church again because the word will be restored and because you as you receive the word as you eat the word you become the word and that's what's happening today the bride is becoming the word and and through through that that wheat plant the wheat plant I think we sometimes we get into our heads you know we're looking at that show but Shooks not part of the show it's not that corn so we just toss them out well no now see the word of the life of God wasn't moving through that plan gone down through the seven churches so in the time of the of the stalk but the time of the little of the tassel that was the word for their day their part of the wheat plant we can't toss them out yes sir but remember one of the evidences of the new birth is that your life continues to move along get the word that bride is moving along and if you stagnate and you stay with the shook instead of let move alone to the kernel of wheat then you what you what happens is you de nominate and you die so that's what we mean when we say that the show that that in this day you're not supposed to be the shuck anymore the life is moving on into the kernel which is and that's what program said would be so hard to tell the difference only the elect would be able to tell because the elect knows what the word is she has become the word and will say that the elect can't be deceived now that's a strong statement because there's meaning today that may not have grown into the full stature and you know you you're you're gonna be deceived if you have not eaten the word that are you you're susceptible to being deceived if you have not received the word if you don't understand or know what the Bible's teaching a beat if you're not equipped to combat the schemes of the devil to know how to withstand his schemes and but when you have eaten the word and you've grown up into a Christian then you're able to see like like Peter said you're able to see far off you're going up the statue of perfect man you have vision where you can see from the top of the mountain you're able to see the schemes of the devils and understand I understand and you and and then you're coming into a man that cannot leave deceit and that's what the bride is going to be so I've got a lot of slides to kind of look through that that's pretty much what I'm gonna be talking about this morning I want to lay the graph of the framework and you know if you can kind of see the pattern now what the Scriptures talking about it helps us to understand and you know that that corner of wheat is so important because you can get in this day especially you can get deceived into thinking well let's just uh I got the new birth because I've got emotions and all those things but it goes back to the word it's got to be that that little corn of wheat is the word expressed and you know some point away you can you can play it in the ground come up because it's not fertilizer that's why he's gotta be the spirit and the truth of me and not just the truth the letter on the paper you know like brother branham explained it in the rising of the Sun and a lot of those messages about how how Jesus's body was laying that was the body of Jesus it after he had died and when his soul went to hell it was laying there in the tomb the spirit had to come and quicken that body and raise it up after without the spirit that it's just dead letter on the page and that's what we need is that there knowing it going there no one comes it will make the word fulfill exactly what it's supposed to do for that day spirit and truth going together so that's what we're looking at a picture from the National Geographic where they took a picture some people in the Middle East harvest in the week the week and eat that just what I was talking about this each one of these little wheat plants this is what God has done he planted himself he planted the church of the day of Pentecost the church grew up through this whole wheat plant the whole wheat plant is it is a type of the Bride of Christ I'm sure he can't throw out the whole wheat plant but eat in each age in each age where each messenger came and delivered his message you got to receive the word for your day and that makes you part of that that the right part of that planet for your day thereby understating I find that when the Spirit makes it live and we talked about this last time that the if it's a genuine spirit anointing the genuine genuine see they can't do nothing but bear a son or daughter of God the genuine spirit on the cocklebur seen a cocklebur seed will make it live just the same as it falls upon a week and makes italy of the spirit upon whether it'll it'll make it come to life the germ with the flesh I'm just kind of gonna go through some of these because it's talking about the the anointed Word but will produce the Word of God made manifest and and you any pet today people you know think about when when did Christ become anointed if Christ there at the River Galilee was the anointed word and and will say well he wasn't he wasn't anointed until the spirit fill on him you know we got to place that exactly right but that doesn't mean that he wasn't God until the end because then nor did Christ the pillar of fire was anointed before the foundation of the world he was anointed when he came forth and began to speak the world into existence I mean how do we say he was anointed because that was the Spirit of God making the word come to pass when he said let there be light that was the word going for his book words but his spirit was there to make it manifest and I you know there's so many that you look around and begin to hear people today struggling with so many things trying to struggling with the young people struggling with with different things thoughts and things that the devil puts on them but there is there's more to the message than just the philosophy just letters on a page man there is a power than a man Liberty but it can come upon the seat it's not it's not just knowing about facts about something but there is a power behind it if you could open up the door of faith and let God come in you know quick in the word and it'll make it manifest in your life there is an actual power I mean I just tell you a little testimony we were down there a ton at the meetings in Louisiana and and I I went up with other ministers and we had the prayer line and everything and after the after there it was all over moving back to the car and just such a great anointing came down and and we got back to the hotel and I just such a great anointing I could not even I couldn't get even get out of car and Monica went she just went on in the hotel and I was in the car praising the Lord yeah and Joe and some of the others were there out there and they said where's my bag he's still out in the car praise of the Lord so but while all that was going on I you know the thought came to me I was quoting scripture and shouting and having a good old time and ended up stagger in the parking lot like like on the day of Pentecost but I I began to think well all that was happening that same anointing could fall upon someone but they don't have any kind of work they don't know they haven't been taught there's nothing they're too quick and all they all they know is that it's a great experience and that's what that's what's so confusing in this day that Jeannie one presence of the Holy Ghost could fall upon you but not quickly to not get down on the inside of your soul now on the other hand we want to be anointed we want to be anointed Christians we're that we we open the door so that God can have his way in our life and you know you get out and work and and and think you kind of get your garments dirty and you we gotta get you get home and you want to get along with God and you maybe you start getting upset at people and everything and if why don't they do this whatever get alone with God a little bit me you let him fresh in your experience and he was sweet in your spirit so you won't be all drawn up in salary anymore he'll it'll make you different because it's the power of God the power of a resurrected life in you and where was that there's a there's a power that's there to deliver us and change us and you know that's really what the hope the message is about delivering us from the things of the world it's not so much you know we but there's a lot of things to learn that seems a real complicated sometimes and difficult but the substance of the essence of the message in that Daniel 17 we because Christ the mystery God revealed everything is that they're redemptive power of God can take you from the things of the world and change you and make you like you and that's that's it summed up the problem is that we we don't believe that we failed we failed our flus Ross stuffed-up stopped up we can't reach out and claim it and just accept what God has done for us everything from marriage and divorce you know people people end up with with horrible circumstances in their life they make mistakes and things you know the worst marriage and divorce situation was they're in the Garden of Eden that's that was so horrible and attend today we put we put that family on the Jerry Springer Show or something that was such a mixed up horrible situation but God gave the grace of marriage and divorce - straight knoweth all that up and all all the grace that he's given to us to chop off our past seasons and and we're taking where you didn't even the real you didn't even do it as you come along to the opening of the work to the real you didn't even do it and all the stuff from this life is laid away laid back to where God has is sanctifying you and perfecting you and that's that's the grace of God that's what the message is about but you gotta have the word to understand that to know that you start off with the little facts and things that you can't quite put together then the Holy Spirit quick is it and he arranges it everything so that you can understand this you should see the pattern so you can see how everything is laid out and then that quickens your faith in you to realize that you're part of that corner week and then that quarter weed is in you and it all fits together into a one beautiful tapestry oh yeah well I've done like five slides so consumer this in here to show that the logo says the anointed that that manifestation of the word that's there knowing and then so who was that on the River Jordan that was that logos Tabernacle in flesh that God Himself Tavor like the soul of God in that man with the flues unstopped in a tabernacle in that man and then the anointing came down on him to quicken him into his ministry and to put him right into into preaching the gospel yes and and right after that anointing came down then the devil begins to test here so let's look at that what was what this man looked like now I know I know you people you start doing dry grams and there you know you get into some trouble you know we condense these things and inside one another everything but I want to look at it kind of like this because this is where we kind of get mixed up a lot of times what what kind of soul did Jesus Christ have there on the River Jordan was it was it somebody soul and then the spirit fellow and many became God or was it that low Gauss that was there from the we read that quote last night last time about how that was Jehovah lying in the manger that was Jehovah God even before the spirit of appointment and on the River Jordan and then that was that low gosh that pill or a fire that that person of who Jesus Christ he is not not just at the nature of the spirit but the so the person of who he is that's what the soul is right and and then what about the spirit now wasn't the spirit kind of like it needed a little bit help to kind of get all wound up because you know that's what the statue of a perfect man is doing for us is I'm blocking all the blues so that the soul of God has been birthed into you can have a have a way of escape I can have an exit so that that all that virtus you and everything can get out to dig up one another and build one another space then his spirit need unblocking or was it was it already blocked like it was when he when he turned the water into wine when he told he told it Mary said woe in my hour has not come but even before he went to the River Jordan he was he's he was turning water into wine because he he knew who he was he knew what is our would when he was gonna come how all he already knew all this oh oh oh the pattern of what his ministry he didn't he was there wasn't no I was wondering what was going on and when your flus get unblocked you begin to realize who you are and what the place is what your place is in that wheat plant so spirit but body he was a man yes he was he was born she came through a woman and and like think about this now if that body was already eternal then he couldn't die for you that so it had to not be turned around so he could die for you that's why we said that's why program said he died as a man of man right right here this that's right this right here he died as a man right but in this and that when that anointing on the river Jordan came on and made clicking that person so much that this couldn't even die that anointing was only made quicken so much that he could walk through a crowd of people and they did not even know he was there because they've tried to kill him it's time to die had not come there in the Garden of Gethsemane the spirit left him and it was time to die it was time and he began to cry out not walk not my will but thine be done and all of those kind of things but there even on the cross but around I have some folks in here he said that was Joe the died on the cross not that it was somebody else on the cross and I stress all this because if you want to know who the corner weed is today you gotta know who the corner of wheat was then it was Christ dwelling in flesh it was God dwelling in flesh what will it be today God tabernacling himself in flesh for saying this this is where we get so you know if when you're preaching you're preaching to the soul to be quickened dead right but so many look to the spirit then won't the spirit to be excited they won't the spirit to be quicken and everything I say the ministers and listen to what people say cuz you know catch up on what what the environment what people are some people's minds and that that's this some people's mind of today you come back from meetings I'll say I didn't come back for meetings and people begin to say well why our church Oh excited like that where people begin to say and you know you go to special meetings and everybody wants to get all excited and everything and and and shout and holler and that's that's what this this atmosphere of the place is you should be willing to jump and and and and shout and get excited but now now when when you hear the word and the when you get a revelation of the word that he has to from your sins they sanctifying your life that's something to get excited now that's this that's right this so they let it sink down into the soul with you next time about this that's why that's why Paul said bodily exercise profiteth little I'm always quoting this to my kids because even those anglers ways and stuff but that's not what Paul minutes alright that's not what Paul me that bottle the exercise probably a little it's alright to you know walk and exercise it's tough I that's good that's good for your body but it is it's good to and wonderful to jump around and stuff but let's get though get that anointing down onto the word you got to have the spirit and the truth anymore so not just a spirit not just an anointing on your body because on your spirit cuz you know down and down and that Louisiana camp that was warned if I had a wonderful time wonderful praise the Lord shout in the parking lot but you can have that same experience and no word no no word at all or false teaching and it won't quicken it that's right there's nothing too quick that's that's that's such a treacherous thing treacherous treacherous treacherous yes you've got to have the word spirit is wonderful to have but you gotta have the word first to eat the word and then let the spirit yes I feel like I'd stay on that for another 30 minutes and it wouldn't be a mom remember in the flesh he was just a man but his spirit he was God but a man in flesh there was before his body was a human being that was subject to temptations subject to sicknesses in just the same as iron yeah Jesus had perfect faith there's talking about the spirit with his food we'll all open up so that that word could operate completely through him and that's important to understand because that's what he's trying to get you to heaven he's trying to get you to a perfect man he's doing that we plan up just the same way as he does the individual right so that the word could float me free and can operate he quickens your life to this age jump over died that was Jehovah there and now recognizing the corner week of this seat back then even the ones that hurt John the Baptist came preaching different ones came preaching and so many failed to recognize that corner week I realized who it was standing there so we look at this this is when John the Baptist was staying on the River Jordan and he began he was speaking and his message was there's one comin who's latches that latching up his shoes I'm not even worthy to unleash his message was there's one coming after me he was going to baptize and so this is what he says and then two disciples heard him speak down there at verse 37 and they followed Jesus now that's what we're supposed to be doing in this last day when this day I lied to ministry like John the Baptist did introduced that corn of wheat and we're supposed to go follow Jesus but yet so many are standing with all the the economy around the Prophet I recognize that John the Baptist came I recognized that Elijah came for our day and so they said we have found the Messiah which is being interpreted the Christ the Anointed were they found it now see it's so easy in this day to fail to recognize the anointed christ and where is he tabernacle the messenger came and preached his message there's a people that heard the message and they believed it and they received it and that word that message has been preached as being made manifest in the flesh of the people that received and so then where where is that manifested Christ now that message has been preached and this in is Tabernacle in the people at earlier message so if you're still back looking at something that we believe that brother bro we believe God sent a project so you must understand what he preached and that goes back to hear that hear the word and then the spirit can quickly and you see now you listen to different ones preaching up it's about to where it gets flip-flop now they're saying that if you if you do believe that the message is in the bride and that there's a five falton full ministry that's called to preach that that makes you an anointed one because you have left the listening of the tapes and the streaming of the tape and that's flip-flop back I wish y'all listen yeah listen to us listen to what's being said and pay attention cuz you know you can you can quote the letter of the message and the letter make a change sack like what brother Branham saying but there's a spirit behind it in essence and when you listen and you hear that their essence in wrong that makes the whole thing wrong yeah that's you know sometimes you could think about when when the when the early apostles laid out the framework of the New Testament and about how we're justified by faith alone and then here comes James and throws a little a little cog in the wheel so to speak and he says you're justified by works and not by faith alone my goodness see it takes the Holy Spirit that spirit is what gives understanding there's a spirit behind it that quickens the word so you can put everything together you kind of have that spirit and there's a spirit behind false doctrine that I'm spirit behind any through doctrine and that's really what you're listening for when you listen to preachers is not so much the exact words that they're using but the essence of they're trying to communicate are they trying to block up the flus are they trying to open them up yeah so listen when you listen to preaching you know you get I I really think so many thought getting so caught up in that spirit part they're listening to preachers based on how they tickle their fancy right how they tickle their emotions and everything and throwing out the word that's why people leave churches it's not because of the word is because of whether they like the guitar played or not yeah that's because of the emotional part of it yeah and not so much because of the word I I'm serious we could hit on that all day long and I don't think it'd be enough yeah you don't realize that in this last day that the shuk is gonna be so close to the seed until only the elect will be able to tell the other because the show is gonna still be stuck on emotion and and back in bygone days and things like that God sent prophet I don't know what he preached but God said the Prophet and just looking for some somebody to preach real good so they can say well I felt some they preached real fast or they preached through a bit you know that's right look here's another one there that did not recognize found it immediately to recognize the corn of wheat for his day was a polyps were they equivalent Priscilla came and expanded again to the way of truth because he was looking at the baptism of John he was still fixated on God sent a prophet but what was the prophets message there's gonna be somebody somebody coming that's gonna baptize you with the Holy Ghost in fire and after he heard it he mildly convinced the Jews and that publicly showing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ yes and then again at the little Ephesian Church we have not so heard so much as heard and they're beating us because they all they knew about was John's baptism they were still fixated on that God sent a prophet and not realizing that he had a message and that message was as he introduced Jesus Christ not just you know we it's wonderful that God sent a prophet but we there's something beyond that and what I mean is that I don't mean that like so many interpret that whether the fivefold ministry is gonna tell us something that the Prophet didn't know come on now God sent a prophet and there's gonna be some people that grab a hold of that make me and believe it and receive it and can share it with us and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus because as soon as you see everything right you gonna run straight to the water does the word when the word opens up to you and you realized through that corner we do yes yeah anointing is a person that's it and if Christ means The Anointed One and he's the same yesterday today and forever and he's the word and the word is the anointing it's the Word of God the anointed word that's what does it the word here I don't believe he's saying just a letter on the page but the word they anointed works has come off the page that's living inside you if that is the the anointed word that's going to fulfill what the letter LePage says y'all don't get too tired now sometimes I feel like even even ministries you know you have to kind of almost yell and scream in horror a little bit to tickle people's face thank you everybody wake up when the word you know the word should be enough really you know we were listening coming up the road I think it was Christ a mystery God revealed we're program was speaking all the same kind of thing that I looked at the little timer on the recording house well is that a 4-hour message and people sitting through for our messages back then we can't hardly sit through 30 minutes here today because I feel like that the word is it's become so commonplace almost that we don't we don't see really see the value move it's just like the children of visual they call that that manner what is it because they didn't realize how valuable it was you think about when you get over on the other side and we're celebrating and praising God for eternity and we're living forever with you all of this is gonna it's gonna be worth it yeah it will produce in your life just like it did in their life I believe that same holy spirit you can rely upon and it will produce in your life just like it did in their life if we could find a way to unleash that power there's power the power of transformation very real power in this word let me skip through these he had it and it become because he was the word Jesus had perfect faith that's that what I really her that he had perfect faith he was he through and through from the souls of the Spirit and that's what God is doing us to us today by making us at Briah tree and that's really one of the one of them I think one of the paramount things for us to see in the message is how God grows us from a little seed up into like a mustard seed into a great big tree that's planted by the rivers of water that it's not tossed about by every wind of doctrine about everything that comes along but we know where we stand and we're drinking from that fountain of everlasting life and we're pulling it in and and and that's what the whole the whole scripture all the way through testifies up like this little chart I made of the of the seven feast days that this is just the first few feast days where Jesus Christ was planted and rose on the eighth day the Feast of the firstfruits and then you know you you take that that barley and you wave it to show that he rose from the dead and then fifty days later on the eighth day the church rises and the the two waves of two to ten deals that you wait to show that the church has risen and it is all testifying of God taking that seed taking this the word planning it and it's growing up into a great tree or there are so many different things that are different kind of plants in the Bible a tree a wheat plant all there are things that to show this same simple message and the message is simple it's not complicated it's as simple as plant something that's going to grow and and then you you get to harvest what you planted ever all down to the seven churches so we know how that in the in the first church age the the original word was was playing risen on the day of Pentecost then I'm through the seven Church agents you got button this is from another trumpet so you know really if you look at this you can't quite visualize it's difficult to visualize this time the space that's what the word was because this piece should be scrunched together but this was fifteen hundred years right now so right after the night scene council when Constantine came out and begin to sow his false doctrine and people got swayed away by those schemes that I was talking about the getting of this lesson they saw all of the supernatural things that were supposedly done in Constantine's life they saw the free farmland and all the things that he offered people to be able to to come into his way of thinking and they got off the word and the word began to be eaten down but yet there was these ministers Columba ministered right after that he was the nephew of Martin all these ministers that Bremer said Martin was the greatest census Christ that did not go off into that denominational system they stayed away from Rome mr. Caze and messengers that stayed with the true word and preached it but the people got in their heads that that that it is fine just to get an emotion or it's fine just to get free farmland or it's fine just to all band together and be one and so the word began to be eaten the word the spirit was still there down through the seven church age is manifesting the life of whatever word whatever a little bit of word could be could be manifest that was still there that the people would believe but the word was eaten down all the way down to the roof just about all the way down and then he began to restore it back through the revelation of Martin Luther's revelation of the new version you know I'm just going all over the place right now but Martin Luther's revelation of the new birth was not was justification it was when you get the new birth that God has justified you man it was not so much that of the first step on the way to get the new birth was justification but his revelation was you get just a found sanctified filled with all ghosts and then you were justified right yeah John Wesley's revelation of the new birth was over there and I think it's first Thessalonians 5:23 if I remember right that God will entirely sanctify you he's looking at the new birth as guy sanctifying work of God performing molding you into his image and you know we get it on our heads that he didn't have the new birth he only had a revelation of the progress on into the new birth of sanctification but that was his revelation about the new birth would and then own into a higher a higher revelation of what the new birth was on the day of Pentecost where the holy ghost himself came and restored the gifts but then we're coming on up into the Eagle age with a message a message of redemption to change it to bring us back like a chart of soul spirit and body that God is bringing us back to full redemption you know where he could take us just how back to how Jesus was after he rose from the dead and his body was glorified it was changed that's where God's taking us back to him to a changed body and the way he does that is through the opening of the word that's why that's why you needed this capstone to come down this capstone message to take us to take us from time to get all because you ain't going to eternity from straight into eternity without a perfect missing now one word off if it was one word off in the beginning that kept Adam and Eve balance shackled to the earth it's going to be I have to be a perfect message of redemption to take us from the ballers of earth into eternity that's that's what this capstone message is this eagle and you can see how we come down through a white horse rider help God it's the scent of a combatant it gets that spirit on an ox Amanda Eagle all of these and the spirit the spirit working in the people through each of these each of these seven churches to manifest that spirit for their age to combat what the devil is doing but now in this age that spirit of the Eagle is a pulling the bride to it to soar higher up than all of the all of the others could ever be able to see and we have to give us a perfect revelation to escape to escape the bonds of tunnel yeah and that's what brother Ram said was called the second seat and the super sign he said the first he called a Christ his second seat look at his new Christ and his bride and the super son he said Christ is the supercede the second seed was Christ and we are born by Christ which makes us the super seat with Christ to God now we are the super seed not an organization now or denomination as a super seat that that that pattern of the two seats set up in Ephesus that first seed was planted Christ and in this day the second seed is being matured that while God brings us right back around to a mature seed again and that parallels that vision that brother had of the two like the two brides and that's what we called the second seat when he saw that vision of the bride being paraded before him twice first the original bride came forth from it from Ephesus not like there's two brides but this is the original an adult rated word of that goes first those first believers that were there the little small group of Ephesians the little small group of believers that in the word was eaten down and now on this day that second seed that second bride was being paraded before I was thinking about all the nonsense I've heard recently about that that vision I can't stay on track yes this is what the bride seed is that the original seed was planted here and the second seed here that he's bringing us up through the through Wheatland that growing us up until we see when you are mature Christian you say in the same thing and so we throw that around their legs not gonna be deceived this is what we mean now if you're down here you can still be deceived you're down here but when you're an adopted son of God and God you the full word of God is being made manifest in you and not just like the fullness of the Godhead Bobby y'all know what I mean but the the word of God for your day is made manifest in your members then you're at a place where you're not gonna be swayed by all the nonsense this bantered about you're not gonna be swayed by somebody saying the through evidence of the Holy Ghost is just a feeling or an emotion and you're gonna know what the what the Prophet is saying yeah you're gonna know the Daniel 70 weeks us really talking about Redemption you know you're gonna have a revelation of what those things are you gonna see when the seven seals are because you see His redemptive work in your life in your own life how God has taken you from the thinnest world and make his life manifest in you cuz it's not just letters on a page but it's a story of what is God has done for you and I think so many have made it just like a book of rules and all of all kind of different things but it's a redemptive story God's love and grace for you yes we still have some time I'm will slide 50 of 83 yeah the bride this is the Builder I was talking about that vision that he talked about in the brian tree said the bride coming to you twice the first seat and the second seat both of them exactly the same one Emma the first seed and the second seed the second seed is just like the first seed because that's that that's that we plant story see how simple that is that's so simple the first seed is planted it grows up through the wheat plant although we planet has debride if you've received the word for your day but then in this day and this time you receive the word for your day and that makes you part of that brings you back to the original that second seed measure Mason see he say that as they marked perfectly in line with the word Emet perfectly in line not one word off that's right that's kind of a bold statement in not one word off and you know will almost make it a doctrinal thing where we just bash each other over the hypnotist about you don't believe without believing that but that's not what that means it's the word bringing us into the the revelation of what of his Redemption for us and and that's what's gonna bring us into oneness that they were all scared and everything on the Pentagon the day of Pentecost but when the spirit fell and quicken that they were all in one Accord the unit right when the spirit quicken them and gave them a true understanding of the word for their day then there what no differences they were all in one Accord and see to go back to the River Jordan where there's a man in with a soul God the spirit of God but in his body he was flesh and after the spirit fell on him to quicken that word to send him in his ministry then Satan began to test him and it says this then was Jesus led up of the spirit of the Spirit like a little and because the sons of God are led by the Spirit of God that's that's what we need the spirit we need the anointing in our lives we need the Spirit of God in us to lead us to the word to a good job that will take up all of our time that will allow us to studying things that I took to a good spouse or whatever to to lead us in the correct way to raise up our children and without the leading of the Spirit and you know if you think you don't leave the spirit then you you're like somebody that says why I can do it on my own we can't do it on my own friends we need God we need the Holy Spirit is in his church we need one another because God are working in each other and ever handle I'm running out of time back up give me one one more minute and this is this is how same test you and I preached on this a few Sundays that there is but the same way that the devil tested Jesus not the same way he tested test you right and this is what I was talking about what Constantine putting the devil through Constantine put all these things in front of the people if thou be the Son of God to get him off the word to get them focused on supernatural things to get them focused on their position something that that the church or somebody can do for them and it gets them off the word and they get off the off the correct focus I'm not gonna have time for this so we're gonna have you go ahead and stop right now and we'll do this some other time [Music] [Music]
