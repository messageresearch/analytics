[21:56] you we love you in Jesus name
[22:00] amen Revelations
[22:03] 3 and then Malachi
[22:08] four and unto the angel of the Church of
[22:11] the lady oans write these things sayth
[22:13] the amen the faithful and true witness
[22:16] who is he the beginning of the creation
[22:18] of God all right now then we go over to
[22:22] Malachi 4 very familiar scriptures with
[22:25] all of us uh while you're getting there
[22:27] we'll read verse 4 remember ye the law
[22:30] of Moses now why would he sum up all
[22:34] things of the Old
[22:36] Testament and then speak of the coming
[22:38] in of the New
[22:40] Testament you know or the Elijah with
[22:44] this kind of a
[22:45] statement because
[22:47] remember by now all the word that has
[22:51] been written was
[22:53] written not just Ten Commandments the
[22:56] word of God so watch what he said
[22:59] remember and I wrote it like this in my
[23:03] my Bible years ago when coming to the
[23:05] end of all the Old Testament he says
[23:09] consider all the
[23:12] word all right then what does he say
[23:14] remember ye the law of Moses my servant
[23:16] which I commanded unto him in horb for
[23:19] all Israel with his statutes and
[23:21] judgments behold I will send you Elijah
[23:24] the prophet before the coming of the
[23:25] great and Dreadful day of the Lord and
[23:28] he shall turn the hearts of the children
[23:31] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[23:33] the children to their fathers lest I
[23:36] come and smite the Earth with a curse
[23:37] amen you may be seated the Lord add his
[23:40] Blessing to the reading of the
[23:47] word now the uh I'm sure you'll probably
[23:52] hear things maybe more but according to
[23:55] what we've heard off the internet system
[23:58] that Russia is in the process of taking
[24:01] away religious freedom from the people
[24:05] of
[24:05] Russia so you know that's coming to P CU
[24:09] remember brother BR said watch Russia
[24:13] why not we got to watch the Catholics we
[24:15] know that that's the part that hinders
[24:17] us but watch Russia because you see
[24:20] what's happening as you're coming down
[24:22] and we heard that yesterday that they
[24:25] were going to take away the religious
[24:27] freedom and see that's all it takes is
[24:30] an act or a pen or whatever to do to
[24:33] change uh I hope you would catch the
[24:36] idea I'm not a doomsday guy I'm a
[24:40] minister but I wish you would understand
[24:43] my point about it you seen like turkey
[24:46] where they uh had a coupe and it didn't
[24:50] work cuz they caught on you know well
[24:52] see that's all it would take
[24:55] here you so can't happen in America
[24:58] go ahead and
[25:00] sleep you you you're you're saying you
[25:03] know you can say well you know our money
[25:05] is going to be taken away no mine
[25:07] won't well even if you got it in your
[25:10] pocket what good is it when it when you
[25:12] have a coupe do you realize what
[25:15] happens your government is
[25:18] gone that could be overnight church but
[25:21] that's not to try to scare you it's to
[25:23] try to instruct that we be ready and
[25:26] against the day that you you and I are
[25:28] living by what by the opening of God's
[25:32] word to you and I it's not what Russia
[25:34] is doing China's doing whatever is doing
[25:37] uh all of that it's what you and I are
[25:40] doing in Christ all right now we read in
[25:43] Malachi 4 we'll get back to that in a
[25:45] minute more but just remember we're
[25:47] still dealing with the stature of a
[25:50] perfect man and I told you Wednesday
[25:53] what I was doing and you know for you uh
[25:57] that was here I will make the point of
[26:01] what I'm doing because the next few
[26:04] messages we have a little title but
[26:06] we've got a third title to the message
[26:09] and we're really talking about the
[26:11] breach between or the uh you know the
[26:15] Gap as we'll get to it later and call it
[26:17] the lap over and the things and uh doing
[26:21] and showing the point that uh to have a
[26:24] gap between something is great to be
[26:27] able to see it but remember we want
[26:29] something to be built through that you
[26:31] know in that to get over what good is
[26:34] having it you know a road running up to
[26:36] a a lake and you know or a river and you
[26:40] say oh we've got a road up to there what
[26:41] good is it if you can't continue on so
[26:44] then there's got to be something that
[26:46] we're dealing with and I'm trying to get
[26:48] the point to for you to look at it that
[26:50] we're not trying to do away but we're
[26:54] and we're not just trying to build in
[26:55] these sides we're trying to tie these
[26:58] together together in the bases that you
[26:59] don't have to move it and just let this
[27:02] day and the hour be what it is all right
[27:05] because to me it reveals great things
[27:08] all right now we we're dealing in the
[27:11] stature of a perfect man and we went
[27:14] through some services and we went
[27:15] through it this past Wednesday covering
[27:18] a lot about it that how that the prophet
[27:21] says the messenger comes where at the
[27:25] End of the Age all right it's all always
[27:28] at that point see he
[27:30] rebukes prior to him and then he brings
[27:35] his message to his people all right you
[27:39] say well that's well Paul come at the
[27:41] End of the Age so he come over there at
[27:43] the end is winding down of Ephesus where
[27:45] would you get that from how could he
[27:47] bring the message to Ephesus now don't
[27:50] get tied up in those Church ages and
[27:53] things of trying to figure out there is
[27:56] actually one of those men that was not
[27:59] even born in the age that brother
[28:02] brandham puts him as to be the messenger
[28:07] of there's actually one of them that is
[28:09] not D some of them were at the middle
[28:11] age this age or that age but remember
[28:14] what your Prophet said I've got it here
[28:17] if they want to pull it up it's on the
[28:19] list but remember what he
[28:25] said oh you'll have to flop all the way
[28:27] over to the LI because it's the Ephesian
[28:30] Church
[28:31] age and he says it this away now what
[28:35] was the let's let's get this one first
[28:38] uh Ephesian Church age paragraph
[28:41] 76 all right we've got it see it now
[28:45] watch I quoted this to you the other
[28:47] night but I want to read it and then
[28:48] we'll read it again this evening to tie
[28:50] in together but watch at the end of the
[28:52] giving of the Revelation according to
[28:54] tradition Paul had already died a martyr
[28:58] watch it but John was carrying on in his
[29:01] stad exactly as Paul had done in the
[29:03] days of his ministry the death of Paul
[29:06] before the Revelation was given before
[29:09] they went to patmas 95 once does not at
[29:13] all an know the fact that he was the
[29:15] messenger to the Ephesian Church age
[29:18] watch him for the messenger to every age
[29:21] regardless of when he appears or goes is
[29:26] the man who influences that age for God
[29:29] by means of a word manifested ministry
[29:33] Paul was that man right
[29:37] now I tried to make a point the other
[29:40] night and I'll make it again to State it
[29:43] see I
[29:45] thought that brother brandham said it
[29:47] was the Holy Spirit that picked those
[29:51] Messengers that's
[29:53] right do you see how ignorant we are in
[29:56] what we do we could think we're great
[29:59] smart elic people to think well this man
[30:02] right here wouldn't even in the ages you
[30:05] know ages done gone
[30:07] and I thought your Prophet said the Holy
[30:10] Spirit picked it so back up to the
[30:12] paragraph 92 of the Ephesian Church all
[30:14] right now what was the spiritual climate
[30:17] of that age amen it had left its first
[30:20] love now watch we'll get back to this in
[30:23] the message why because
[30:26] Paul came at the end of the age end of
[30:29] what
[30:30] age well it came to end of Ephesus well
[30:33] then how could he bring the message to
[30:34] Ephesus no what's the prophet explaining
[30:38] what he came at we'll get back to that
[30:40] in a little bit it had left its first
[30:42] love is that the
[30:45] scripture that's Revelations 2 and 4 3
[30:49] and
[30:50] 4 that's the message to the church age
[30:53] in Ephesus leaving the first love of the
[30:56] word of God was revealed to us as having
[30:59] fallen from its
[31:01] origin which was
[31:05] Pentecost all right living his first
[31:08] love was falling from Pentecost where
[31:12] did Paul where was he at and who was he
[31:15] rebuking that's all we read these things
[31:18] and then you keep that in mind as we're
[31:20] going along that we want to tie together
[31:23] this point until we can find the age
[31:26] we're living
[31:29] the message and how it ties in and you
[31:31] say well what has that got to do with
[31:35] us because it is this hour
[31:38] amen it is this day amen we must know
[31:42] the day we're living how can you know
[31:45] the day you're living if you don't know
[31:47] about the ages prior and what they
[31:51] were I'm talking about knowing in the
[31:54] Bible where you're at that's right I'm
[31:56] not talking about just oh we're in Lady
[31:59] of everybody preaches we in Lady of yeah
[32:04] oh yeah and it'll be around the world
[32:06] today everybody preaching about how that
[32:09] Russia is doing this and that of the
[32:11] other and they're coming after us next
[32:13] well that's all
[32:15] right that's all right that's well and
[32:18] good
[32:20] but what good does that do if we're not
[32:23] in the
[32:25] word right amen see go along with it if
[32:30] we're not in the word to understand
[32:32] what's going on and we'll think it's of
[32:36] God the biggest portion of the religious
[32:38] world is going to do that isn't it well
[32:41] what do you think makes us
[32:44] different well we got the Holy
[32:46] Ghost if we've got the Holy Ghost we'll
[32:49] be in the word for the age is that the
[32:51] evidence of the Holy
[32:53] Ghost the word of this age so we have to
[32:55] get to that point all right remember
[32:58] what we went
[32:59] through in the church ages we I mean in
[33:02] the Statue of a perfect man we saw that
[33:05] they were eight
[33:07] manifestations Faith virtue knowledge
[33:09] temper fa God in this brotherly kindness
[33:12] and love eight
[33:14] manifestations of God but there were
[33:16] only seven ads am the prophet said the
[33:20] age and The Messengers of the age and
[33:23] the I came up the same as the people did
[33:27] all right then we went in trying to get
[33:28] real quick now we went into talking
[33:31] about the church ages and how that there
[33:33] was seven Church ages seven
[33:37] angels but there were eight
[33:39] manifestations of God in those ages all
[33:43] right see then that goes to show you can
[33:45] look at the pyramid about your
[33:47] Messengers and showing that the
[33:49] messenger come at the End of the
[33:51] Age all right as he came at the End of
[33:54] the Age see he is to bring the truth for
[33:58] the
[33:59] age to you and I put brother Brandon
[34:02] back down there at the end of of
[34:05] uh Wesley's age he would be the
[34:09] messenger to Lady OA and he said he was
[34:13] not that he came at the End of the Age
[34:15] all right I'm trying to get you to see
[34:17] something history side of where we can
[34:19] take the prophet's message and bring out
[34:22] the things and see it l in to see where
[34:24] we're
[34:26] at to see where we're standing
[34:29] recognizing your
[34:32] day and his
[34:35] message what is the message of this
[34:39] day I
[34:42] thought that we were to believe that we
[34:44] were the Bride of Jesus
[34:46] Christ all
[34:51] right then we'll see in my point has
[34:54] been a couple of messages and still
[34:56] driving now from my heart to get you to
[34:58] see that it's always been the holy
[35:02] spirit in every
[35:05] age it's always been God Mankind in the
[35:11] AES that we live
[35:14] in and by doing that then every
[35:17] messenger would not be exactly like Paul
[35:20] but they're supposed to pattern after
[35:23] him and if the Holy Spirit picked those
[35:26] ages and wrote them in the Bible you
[35:30] know Ephesians all like that wrote
[35:34] that then you're PR by the same
[35:38] holy spirit that
[35:41] wrote about these
[35:43] ages all right see then we can run
[35:46] haywire and try to figure out this that
[35:48] or the other no just don't worry about
[35:50] it do what he
[35:52] said the Holy Spirit Pi the
[35:55] messenger of the age right because that
[35:59] was the one working for God during that
[36:01] age and no matter what are the time wise
[36:05] you know when I just can't see that
[36:08] because this there you go you don't have
[36:10] a
[36:13] revelation see you don't have a
[36:15] revelation and you're trying to figure
[36:17] out everything and get it to your own
[36:19] thinking all right but see remember this
[36:23] point the Holy Ghost always comes at the
[36:27] end End of the
[36:29] Age the reason it comes that way is to
[36:32] where there's got to
[36:35] be message stand between lady oia and
[36:41] Eternity right right I believe we've had
[36:45] that message I'm not looking for another
[36:48] Messenger to
[36:49] come hour and a half or something on the
[36:52] hour last night on the phone with a
[36:54] brother I think he was trying to
[36:57] present something and I'm just too dumb
[37:00] to fall after it so made a couple of
[37:02] quotes back to him
[37:04] and it's you know it's very easy if
[37:08] you're not trying to be sarcastic but
[37:11] when somebody's talking to you about
[37:12] something it's just just throw them a
[37:15] curve and see if they follow the curve
[37:18] if they don't then you know that it
[37:20] doesn't work too good but I'm not
[37:23] against anybody he was bringing out some
[37:25] good
[37:26] things but
[37:28] I want to know what he was talking about
[37:30] I'm not interested
[37:32] in all of these other things I'm
[37:35] interested in one thing you and I being
[37:37] ready against the
[37:40] day the age is fast coming to a close
[37:44] and if we're not ready then we'll be
[37:47] like the rest now what did I tell you 40
[37:50] years
[37:52] ago that the biggest portion of these
[37:55] people of the message even borned again
[37:58] would die and go by the
[38:02] grave cuz they won't be able to stand
[38:05] the pressure of the hour they we're
[38:08] facing cuz remember it's got to come
[38:10] from
[38:12] within I ain't worried about the
[38:14] government passing
[38:18] laws I'm concerned about the preachers
[38:21] in the pull pit passing their ideas
[38:24] that's right more than laws you know and
[38:26] doing because that'll get to that point
[38:28] okay but
[38:30] listen what was we talking about
[38:32] Wednesday night when brother brandham
[38:34] says you'll see an
[38:38] age cuz the Holy Ghost came himself he
[38:41] said in the fullness of the
[38:45] baptism but yet there's a lot of people
[38:47] believe that ausus tree had
[38:50] nothing or give them a little bit but
[38:53] not like the book of Acts well I hope
[38:57] this this has called on to you to
[38:59] understand that I'm a firm believer as I
[39:01] said a moment ago that the Holy Ghost is
[39:03] in every age ate down not the
[39:08] Holy See then God can only work
[39:11] according to the amount of word that he
[39:13] has the ability to use so that's why he
[39:16] had to start with Luther and Wesley and
[39:19] Pentecost and remember those were
[39:23] reformers for not restoration amen
[39:28] you said well it was Resto yeah I've got
[39:30] yeah okay I have to Sure Luther was
[39:33] restoration if you'll take it to the
[39:35] just shall live by faith Wesley of
[39:37] sanctification was restoration but the
[39:39] people in time was Reformation yes amen
[39:42] cuz they were
[39:43] reforming all right and that's why it's
[39:46] the age that when you come to isusa
[39:48] Street see then the Holy Ghost came
[39:52] himself that was not my words that's
[39:54] brother Brown's words of questions and
[39:57] answers on the
[39:59] seals that we gave Wednesday night all
[40:02] right remember the messenger
[40:05] always comes at the End of the
[40:09] Age come at the beginning of the
[40:12] age and remember we gave you these about
[40:16] brother Bram and saying when did he
[40:18] start his message remember according
[40:21] to 327 Church age book this messenger of
[40:25] Malachi 4 Luke 17 dirty is going to do
[40:28] two things first the fathers two
[40:33] reveal the Thunders which is revelation
[40:35] containing the seven seal it'll be these
[40:37] divinely revealed mystery truths he said
[40:40] that literally turn us back amen all
[40:42] right what have I said from the
[40:45] beginning the only way you'll get the
[40:47] virtues of the Statue of a perfect man
[40:49] is for the for God to unveil his
[40:53] word CU it's not an automatic ad just
[40:55] because it's you're this that or the
[40:57] other something you amen is Jesus
[41:01] Christ amen in the hour that you and I
[41:04] are living that's right all right see if
[41:07] we believe we're in the last days
[41:10] right then we ought to believe that
[41:13] everything's coming to an
[41:15] end
[41:16] amen right well you know what if
[41:20] everything's coming to an end why can't
[41:22] we see what happen at there because to
[41:25] me way he said to biggest portion of the
[41:28] Old
[41:30] Testament was fulfilled in the last few
[41:32] hours of
[41:34] Calvary right you know
[41:36] fulfill the last few hours well can't we
[41:39] see that in this age is to wind up
[41:43] everything
[41:46] right and you remember I mean you mean
[41:49] to tell me that we're in an age that has
[41:51] wind up everything well yeah
[41:54] we we make it to church
[41:58] yeah know I just I just can't do this
[42:01] can't do we just barely can
[42:05] survive you wouldn't listening the other
[42:07] night when I was giving the quotes from
[42:09] The Prophet when he said what he said
[42:11] the same Spirit of those people that
[42:13] gave their lives down to those Dark Ages
[42:15] is the same Holy Spirit we use daily to
[42:17] just overcome that's right why shouldn't
[42:20] we be the happiest
[42:22] people and more concerned with studying
[42:25] the message of the hour to be prepared
[42:29] against the day that we're living when
[42:31] we know this is the greatest it has ever
[42:35] been well I just don't see
[42:37] nothing Well the reason you don't see it
[42:40] cuz you don't have inside of you the one
[42:41] to see it with that plain enough are you
[42:44] telling me I'm lost no you told me is
[42:48] lost right see don't throw it at me I'll
[42:51] just give it back to you you tell me
[42:54] that I don't see nothing
[42:57] well then if you don't see nothing that
[42:59] means you can't see it because the Bible
[43:02] says it's
[43:03] happening right the Bible says we're in
[43:07] the end the Bible says that this is the
[43:10] greatest age it has ever
[43:15] been when others don't see nothing well
[43:18] then that means you can't got the one
[43:19] inside to see with so you need to get
[43:22] born again that's
[43:24] right I've told you over and over how
[43:26] many times you ever heard this statement
[43:28] well brother random didn't say
[43:34] that he said he'll take them seven
[43:36] unknown Thunders to wake her up back
[43:40] in the bride he said ain't never had a
[43:42] Revival that's right that's right we'll
[43:45] get to it this evening where the
[43:46] messenger of the age and the bride age
[43:49] and the things right because we believe
[43:53] it but see I've been in a Revival ever
[43:57] since I've been in this message Revival
[43:59] to me is not the
[44:00] shouting
[44:03] GL Hallelujah things that you think of a
[44:06] Revival that's
[44:10] right you think it's a Revival that's
[44:12] why I asking you Wednesday night you
[44:14] know when you say holy spirit when you
[44:18] say headstone Capstone whatever what do
[44:21] you think
[44:23] about I thought the Holy Spirit was the
[44:26] word in Spirit made one that's
[44:29] right cuz if it's not you just got the
[44:33] anointing that's
[44:35] right
[44:39] ones but if it's the word and spirit as
[44:42] one together you have the alive word of
[44:47] God sure I'd love to have men alive
[44:51] what's in my
[44:53] brain right but there's one thing about
[44:55] it there is some things that was in my
[44:58] brain that are now in my
[45:00] heart
[45:02] right that's right cuz I'm not going to
[45:05] reject what's
[45:08] here well I just don't see it like that
[45:10] look around the
[45:12] world right they had it on the phone
[45:14] there a while ago where a certain
[45:16] brother I won't call their name whatever
[45:18] was talking about a little
[45:20] girl that she' lost her hire and
[45:23] everything and they prayed and God
[45:25] restored it a lay man
[45:28] I believe that but you know what we've
[45:30] got a little girl sitting back
[45:33] there that when she was four years old
[45:36] three four years old two years old her
[45:39] hair started falling
[45:42] out so much until at 2 years old she
[45:46] become
[45:49] concerned you know what we prayed about
[45:52] it right how many of you remember that
[45:55] we prayed about it and you going to look
[45:57] at her high now she sits down on
[46:01] it see why don't we believe God is with
[46:05] us what do we need well I'd like to see
[46:08] it this way like see it that way like
[46:10] I've told you and I know you don't like
[46:12] it but I'd like for you to do it I want
[46:14] you to read the book of Acts and write
[46:16] down the accounts in the book of Acts of
[46:20] the Holy Spirit and what it done now I
[46:21] know I got sense I know the Bible said
[46:24] all the things were not written right
[46:27] but here comes a prophet to say what he
[46:30] said more in one
[46:35] service than the book of
[46:39] Acts cuz if you counted the the great
[46:42] Miracles and happening in the book of
[46:43] Acts you only have maybe 10 15 20
[46:47] things how many things has been Among Us
[46:50] that we've seen from the dead raised to
[46:52] the sick healed to to the things amen
[46:56] right
[46:58] all right we see we say we don't see
[47:02] nothing well you can't see because
[47:05] you're
[47:11] blind but listen what did we talk about
[47:13] Wednesday
[47:15] night when did Brother Brandon's message
[47:18] actually
[47:20] begin he said well he begun back there
[47:22] in
[47:23] 1947 right that's you're okay but
[47:26] because that's part of
[47:29] connecting but remember Malachi 4 is to
[47:33] do two things that's
[47:35] right number one we read in the Bible
[47:38] that he would turn the hearts of the
[47:41] fathers to the
[47:43] children all right now back
[47:49] there it came forth but what is that
[47:52] really speaking
[47:54] of the hearts of the fathers
[47:57] to the children it was the new message
[48:01] right faith of the
[48:03] fathers hearts are the Old Testament
[48:06] fathers to the New Testament
[48:09] message
[48:11] right but you know now the Life part of
[48:15] that is to turn the hearts of the
[48:18] children back to the
[48:21] fathers why would it be saiding it that
[48:23] way cuz it's showing you that it's going
[48:25] to fall away down Through the Ages
[48:27] the faith of the fathers the revelation
[48:29] of the Apostles was lost during the in
[48:33] those
[48:34] ages right and it come out with Luther
[48:37] of the just shall live by
[48:39] faith see all right see then this
[48:43] messenger is going to
[48:46] restore the faith of the
[48:49] fathers I'm not the one that wrote it in
[48:51] the book he said he preached 33 years
[48:53] before he could preach statue of perfect
[48:55] man statue of perfect man was written in
[48:57] the
[48:59] Bible Peter talked about the statute of
[49:02] perfect man written in the Bible right
[49:05] but yet it took a prophet 30 something
[49:06] years before he could bring what he saw
[49:09] that's right so what's he talking
[49:12] about it took him all of that time to
[49:15] try to get us back to the faith of the
[49:18] fathers see then his message would
[49:21] come right so then it would
[49:25] be like like he says on trying to do God
[49:28] a service we use
[49:30] Wednesday paragraph 10 uh 165 goes on to
[49:35] one one yeah 165 let's just read
[49:40] it I want you to see the truth of what
[49:44] I'm talking
[49:46] about and believe in
[49:48] it trying to do God a service without
[49:50] being his will paragraph 165 through 166
[49:54] goes into to the bottom he says not when
[49:57] he starts out doing this but when he
[50:00] begins to sound his
[50:03] message see not the years in
[50:08] preparation but when he begins to sound
[50:11] the message is that scripture Revelation
[50:13] 10:7 says what the days of the voice of
[50:16] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[50:21] sound he begin to sound his message see
[50:24] where did he where is his message
[50:27] all right go to the Rapture paragraph 1
[50:31] uh8 and in the seventh Angel's message
[50:34] while he was making his Proclamation his
[50:38] ministry then when he be to sound forth
[50:43] his ministry not when he started
[50:46] out now what does he compare it with
[50:49] Jesus when he started out he started
[50:52] Healing The Sick and thing oh he was a
[50:54] great prophet but when he be to say I my
[50:57] father one was used to do
[51:01] restoration why because it took a
[51:03] prophet that's it that's what I've
[51:05] always tried to get you to
[51:07] see Peter and them had the message
[51:09] that's what they tried to tell the
[51:11] people how to get where they were but
[51:13] when the the message was lost of that
[51:17] you know the word be to to be taken away
[51:21] down to the ages until you come to a
[51:23] dark ages
[51:27] of almost nothing scripturally we would
[51:29] talk
[51:31] about and here comes Luther with the
[51:33] message of you shall live by
[51:35] faith amen ordained of God to fall at
[51:38] the right time to be at that why because
[51:41] that would that's what it would be see
[51:44] the messenger then would come at the end
[51:46] of the
[51:48] age and he would bring that message to
[51:51] the people
[51:54] [Music]
[51:56] because see that would be the lineup of
[52:00] God that would be the way God would
[52:03] ordain it to
[52:06] be see Luther never came out preaching
[52:08] the statue of a perfect man yet he
[52:11] probably preached messages on second
[52:14] Peter is what I said they they didn't
[52:17] understand the seals and the thing but
[52:19] yet Luther probably preach commentaries
[52:21] if you could find it messages about the
[52:24] seals and the things
[52:27] right but it was not the age to come
[52:31] forth it was not the time for God to
[52:34] reveal it that's
[52:37] right so then what would be this last
[52:40] day
[52:43] message what I was trying my best to get
[52:45] you to see I'm keep on trying to here
[52:47] that when that message came you
[52:51] realize now whether you like it or what
[52:54] you realize that God not kept his word
[52:58] and sent a prophet to this age they
[53:00] would no way ever could have been a
[53:05] Rapture there would have been a running
[53:07] out of time and
[53:09] everything and that was not ordained in
[53:12] God's word so you mean a Rapture a
[53:15] change of people only if it's only
[53:18] [Music]
[53:20] two right or one
[53:23] or you realize as the brother was
[53:25] bringing light not about Enoch walk with
[53:28] God and I knew that scripture there and
[53:31] you know but he asked the question or
[53:33] didn't ask the question but he told it
[53:36] the only two people that's ever said
[53:38] that they walk with God was Enoch and
[53:42] who who was the other one
[53:46] Noah we talk about Enoch going up
[53:50] wonderful what he tyed but what about
[53:53] Noah going up riding over and coming
[53:55] back down which was just as much a
[53:59] typ and the Bible says Noah walked with
[54:04] God see the emphasis is laid upon what
[54:08] he's using it
[54:12] for you you realize that that say like
[54:15] uh to show you an example the the Bible
[54:18] speaking of John the
[54:20] Baptist the prophet would speak of him
[54:23] being full of the Holy Ghost from his
[54:25] mother's Wom the Bible says you
[54:28] know 6 months and he jumped and was
[54:31] moving and said he was fil you ever
[54:34] notice the other scriptures about Mary
[54:35] being full of the Holy Ghost about
[54:37] Martha being full of the Holy Ghost
[54:39] about all these
[54:42] people but see it's the emphasis you're
[54:45] making upon the situation
[54:49] right
[54:52] right the others that would be say full
[54:55] of the Holy Ghost would not be counted
[54:58] like John to come forth with that
[55:01] situation or Enoch to walk off the
[55:06] earth but see it says of Noah that he
[55:08] walked with God see we don't read the
[55:11] Bible to have an understanding we just
[55:15] do what we want to with
[55:17] it but
[55:18] listen the prophet said this message he
[55:24] said 62 he he said could not have been
[55:27] preached 40 years
[55:31] ago right you realize 40 years from 62
[55:35] put in
[55:38] 42 right is that
[55:41] mathematically which would have been
[55:45] 42 excuse me 22 let me get my numbers
[55:51] right you say well no he couldn't have
[55:53] come cuz he wouldn't die no they would
[55:56] was no
[55:59] situation he says it there I gave you
[56:01] the quote what knowing all
[56:04] alone the message was
[56:11] coming I remember one brother said
[56:14] brother Brown told him he knew that he
[56:17] was to be the Malachi 4 and the brother
[56:20] says and I heard him say it he said well
[56:23] why don't you just go Proclaim it he
[56:25] said you can't do
[56:30] that brother Ram didn't jump out there
[56:32] proclaiming who he was he let God prove
[56:35] who he
[56:38] was then he solved the whole problem all
[56:40] right but are you following me see when
[56:42] the messenger comes at the end of the
[56:44] age it's got a reason for coming
[56:50] there now I've told you from the very
[56:52] beginning of I preached this 40 years
[56:54] ago I believe that The Headstone to the
[56:57] message is brother Brown's message I
[56:59] mean The Headstone to the bride is
[57:00] brother Brown's
[57:01] message what else are you going to make
[57:04] it see you want it some great anointing
[57:07] or some
[57:13] great see that's all you think about
[57:17] headstone if the
[57:20] headstone is the
[57:24] Cornerstone then the Cornerstone was a
[57:26] revelation of Jesus Christ
[57:28] am what would be the
[57:34] headstone didn't say it said it's
[57:36] revelation of supreme
[57:39] deity what are you following me
[57:42] now have you been listening to what I've
[57:44] been doing cuz like I said I'm I'm
[57:46] talking about filling this
[57:49] in not to put aide in or do that no but
[57:52] filling in to where that you have no Gap
[57:56] between the body of Jesus Christ and The
[58:00] Headstone you don't lower it down just
[58:03] leave it alone bring the
[58:06] message and let the message just fill it
[58:11] in if you don't believe Red's message
[58:13] was a headstone what do you believe the
[58:15] headstone is going to be
[58:18] right you don't realize you're looking
[58:20] for another messenger
[58:27] see his message was the
[58:30] word when are we going to realize
[58:34] that it wasn't just signs and
[58:37] wonders that's always been in the word
[58:40] of
[58:42] God
[58:44] right the Bible is full of signs and
[58:48] wonders but anointed ones can do signs
[58:51] and
[58:53] wonders but they can't bring a message
[58:56] oh they got their own message you know
[58:58] what I'm talking about you know the one
[58:59] we even gave there was it Wednesday or
[59:02] last Sunday where brother Bron said if
[59:04] it comes forth with signs and wonders
[59:06] and stays in that same old
[59:11] organization see that's why I've never
[59:13] been concerned see I know that these
[59:16] things happened I know that even after
[59:18] brother bradam passed away that there
[59:20] were certain
[59:23] people went to a certain brother that
[59:26] had signs and
[59:31] wonders I ain't calling no names I'm
[59:33] just saying
[59:36] it because they was checking out to
[59:41] see what was he checking out to
[59:46] see see if he was the messenger to take
[59:49] over I guess what else would you go
[59:52] there
[59:54] for but see we done
[59:57] told what we''re done told it don't
[1:00:01] matter if the signs and wonders comes
[1:00:04] and they stay with the same message of
[1:00:08] the ages and things before that has
[1:00:10] brought forth you know not the truth of
[1:00:12] it the denomination on said don't
[1:00:15] believe it that's right I thought we
[1:00:17] believe where the scripture said we
[1:00:18] bringing out the other day about that
[1:00:20] scripture where he said if a if a if a
[1:00:22] man comes and a Prophet come and he
[1:00:24] gives you a sign and it comes to that's
[1:00:29] right oh if it com to we got to believe
[1:00:32] it no that scripture doesn't say that
[1:00:35] that's another scripture those two can't
[1:00:37] be fighting each other right it said if
[1:00:41] he takes you to another
[1:00:43] God don't believe
[1:00:46] him why he said because I send him among
[1:00:51] you to try you
[1:00:54] right we don't like that do we we don't
[1:00:57] think God would do something like
[1:00:59] that I like the way brother Ram says
[1:01:02] things and a lot of times it's humorous
[1:01:04] and a lot of times it's not too humorous
[1:01:07] but he said God wanted to make sure that
[1:01:11] he had the right man and Moses before he
[1:01:13] got down there you
[1:01:17] know to the Dead Sea or the sea you know
[1:01:21] now God wanted to make sure now that's
[1:01:27] yes but you know
[1:01:30] what you know
[1:01:32] what God wanted to make
[1:01:36] sure you what God knows all
[1:01:39] things when these days I'm going to
[1:01:41] preach on
[1:01:42] that when he days I want to preach on
[1:01:44] does God know
[1:01:47] everything well yeah he
[1:01:52] does well how come my sins can go that
[1:01:55] way
[1:01:57] into the sea of forgetfulness and he can
[1:01:59] never remember them then does he know
[1:02:02] everything like we think about it you
[1:02:05] know we might find out one of these days
[1:02:06] the prophet was right when he said that
[1:02:09] said he want to make sure he had the
[1:02:10] right
[1:02:11] man now we hold it and right it is good
[1:02:14] Moses was really the one he's working on
[1:02:16] to make sure that he
[1:02:17] understood okay we go along with that
[1:02:19] but still remember the rest of
[1:02:23] it see this message church has brought
[1:02:26] to you and
[1:02:29] I why is it that people don't want to
[1:02:32] study it we've had 50 years since the
[1:02:35] going of the Prophet why is it that we
[1:02:38] don't want to this become engu in what
[1:02:43] is
[1:02:44] said instead of trying to still figure
[1:02:47] it
[1:02:49] out or argue with
[1:02:54] it you mean this would not be the most
[1:02:56] important of all
[1:03:00] ages when everything the Bible said is
[1:03:03] waiting
[1:03:05] what on
[1:03:11] us but what about it
[1:03:16] Church what about
[1:03:20] it can you see that the prophet's
[1:03:23] message where it came out
[1:03:28] see that's why in the Years
[1:03:31] prior now I'm not one of these oh he was
[1:03:34] wrong here he was right
[1:03:36] here brother brandham was right if it
[1:03:39] wasn't he corrected is wrong he was the
[1:03:42] one that done
[1:03:44] it all
[1:03:47] right
[1:03:49] remember even after the seals
[1:03:53] broke brother brandham made some
[1:03:55] mistakes
[1:03:57] in his speech and connections of
[1:04:01] things which you take you got to say the
[1:04:04] message was
[1:04:07] right come on folks he didn't do it
[1:04:11] until he got on over our later you know
[1:04:13] that brother randam was teaching 14 I
[1:04:16] mean teaching
[1:04:18] uh 14 seals 14 bindings 12 of seven on
[1:04:23] the outside the book seven on the inside
[1:04:25] the book until about 64
[1:04:31] 65 that's what he
[1:04:33] said he said I believe there were seven
[1:04:36] on the inside seven on the
[1:04:41] outside why because he was a
[1:04:43] human that's why I've always said the
[1:04:47] messenger the
[1:04:49] man was not
[1:04:51] infallible but the message he brought
[1:04:54] right is infallible
[1:04:57] amen right there's where we stand what
[1:05:01] we stand here as
[1:05:03] people you realize that I don't know why
[1:05:05] I got on to this I don't drop my notes
[1:05:07] I'll preach this evening on
[1:05:10] that you realize that you and I are
[1:05:14] standing where no one has ever
[1:05:18] stood we're standing
[1:05:21] between Mortal
[1:05:24] life you know
[1:05:26] living and even with the new birth and
[1:05:29] coming down all that's
[1:05:31] wonderful with the soul being Eternal
[1:05:33] but we're standing in a place if this
[1:05:36] message is not the message to change
[1:05:38] these bodies we better find another
[1:05:45] one
[1:05:49] right but you see I just ain't been able
[1:05:51] to find nothing else to tie together any
[1:05:54] thoughts about it
[1:05:59] right then you know I don't go after the
[1:06:01] signs and the Wonders and all these
[1:06:02] other things cuz you'd be going after
[1:06:04] some of these guys that you know has got
[1:06:06] things that
[1:06:09] happen but see I remember a statement
[1:06:11] brother Brandon
[1:06:13] says they didn't come with the
[1:06:16] message signs and
[1:06:19] wonders but without a message
[1:06:24] yep signs and wonders followed this
[1:06:26] man's
[1:06:27] Ministry that we talk
[1:06:30] about with a message
[1:06:33] followed a message to change you and I
[1:06:37] from Mortal to
[1:06:39] immortality or else we better start
[1:06:41] searching for another
[1:06:44] messenger well that's what I'm trying my
[1:06:46] best to preach to you whether you
[1:06:49] understand it or not talking about the
[1:06:50] messenger coming at the End of the Age
[1:06:52] there's not no brother random I got the
[1:06:54] quotes here where he says that cannot be
[1:06:56] another
[1:06:58] age
[1:07:00] right
[1:07:05] why who gave him the authority to say
[1:07:10] that when it can't be another
[1:07:16] age well we need this Eighth Day
[1:07:21] guy we need that farun around done
[1:07:23] preach today right
[1:07:26] that's what a brother said at my house
[1:07:27] talking about you you know oh yeah we do
[1:07:29] this right the other I said why don't
[1:07:31] you guys tell us something Beyond
[1:07:32] brother
[1:07:33] Bram I said he's already preached us to
[1:07:36] the Future
[1:07:40] home
[1:07:41] right he was in my home and asked the
[1:07:44] question I figured I had a right to
[1:07:45] answer it I said why don't y'all tell us
[1:07:48] beyond the future
[1:07:53] home if y'all are to take over
[1:08:01] but see the prophet said there's not
[1:08:03] another age
[1:08:05] amen it goes from this age of the seven
[1:08:09] what I've tried to get you to see
[1:08:10] mathematically the seventh Church age
[1:08:13] now I'll give you quotes either way you
[1:08:15] want it the seventh Church Age The
[1:08:17] Prophet says ends in the Rapture the
[1:08:19] bride now he'll make that
[1:08:21] statement but then he'll cover the
[1:08:23] seventh Church age going all the way
[1:08:25] through on a seven through the
[1:08:27] Millennium because it's still a seven
[1:08:29] right there's time still in the
[1:08:32] Millennium it's under a number
[1:08:36] seven but you see if we don't strike a
[1:08:38] number eight we don't have any
[1:08:41] hopes you know what comes after the
[1:08:48] Millennium do you know the
[1:08:50] order what comes after the millennium
[1:08:55] the watch your own
[1:09:02] judgment you want to go
[1:09:06] there come
[1:09:08] on I can show you where the Prophet lays
[1:09:10] it out and Order and Order and order
[1:09:11] coming
[1:09:13] down what's the next thing
[1:09:18] Rapture he said while the tribulation
[1:09:21] I'm quoting him is setting up in upon
[1:09:24] you and I for rejecting the message he
[1:09:27] said Israel is receiving their
[1:09:31] message he said then tribulation strikes
[1:09:37] Israel he said the next is a
[1:09:40] millennium the next is the white Throne
[1:09:43] he said then you I mean excuse me yeah
[1:09:46] the white Throne he said then the next
[1:09:47] is the future
[1:09:52] home well then it's this message to take
[1:09:54] you and I into eternal life and that's
[1:09:57] exactly scriptural what I was trying to
[1:09:58] bring the other night I what showing it
[1:10:02] amen that this man stood to bring you
[1:10:05] and I a
[1:10:09] message that's scripture right that's
[1:10:13] where he was telling you to go back in
[1:10:15] your
[1:10:18] scripture according Leviticus he said
[1:10:21] 258 that's 77 is 49 mhm the messenger in
[1:10:26] the seventh Church age is to
[1:10:28] proclaim a 50 to be
[1:10:32] coming if we don't reach a 50 somewhere
[1:10:35] physically world and everything then
[1:10:38] we've stopped the
[1:10:43] Bible right but yeah we got but we just
[1:10:46] go we just
[1:10:48] go
[1:10:51] yeah but see this man that brought the
[1:10:54] message we don't put that on the man
[1:10:56] it's not that it's the message that he
[1:10:58] brought us that's
[1:11:01] right he's carried us all the way to the
[1:11:04] Future
[1:11:07] home what is beyond there there is
[1:11:10] nothing beyond the future
[1:11:14] home that's a summing up of all things
[1:11:17] that's
[1:11:19] right I sure hope to goodness he don't
[1:11:21] let it start back over
[1:11:26] that's silly anyway but I sure hope you
[1:11:28] don't let it start back over because we
[1:11:30] don't want more to go over but it
[1:11:32] wouldn't
[1:11:33] work
[1:11:35] so this prophet's message is come to
[1:11:39] bring you and
[1:11:40] I eternal life in these
[1:11:45] flesh well why wouldn't we want to study
[1:11:47] the
[1:11:50] message why wouldn't we not want to
[1:11:52] Devour the message
[1:11:56] is that not in Revelation where he was
[1:11:58] told to take the book to not just take
[1:12:01] the book take the book and eat the
[1:12:05] book right am why would we have any
[1:12:09] other thoughts about anything else other
[1:12:11] than we've got a message and we've got
[1:12:14] it laid into our lap so where we can
[1:12:16] study anything we want to on it through
[1:12:19] the computers and the things right why
[1:12:22] would we not want to study that message
[1:12:25] and know the message to the to the
[1:12:29] letter A man told Brother mo one time
[1:12:32] brother Mo said something about getting
[1:12:34] the the tapes and giving them to the
[1:12:36] people to this certain brother the
[1:12:38] brother said you don't need to do that
[1:12:41] said them people know just as much about
[1:12:43] the message as you
[1:12:45] do well
[1:12:50] that's so I love to preach to people
[1:12:53] amen that know what he said
[1:12:56] that's
[1:12:58] right cuz see if you know what he said
[1:13:01] and I say it that way you're not trying
[1:13:03] to figure out whether he said it or not
[1:13:05] that's right but I do a lot of reading
[1:13:08] to make sure you understand he said it
[1:13:16] right it's not my idea or my thoughts is
[1:13:20] what he says
[1:13:26] L also said this come on I'll talk with
[1:13:29] any of you anytime on your
[1:13:34] allos right
[1:13:36] right but just remember we're going to
[1:13:38] come back to the na the also show we're
[1:13:40] going to come back to what he
[1:13:43] said right and we're going to come back
[1:13:46] with it in the right order right we're
[1:13:48] going to come back with it like Matthew
[1:13:50] 28:19 saying the same thing as acts 238
[1:13:55] right right right it's not one saying
[1:13:58] one
[1:14:00] thing you never heard the people of the
[1:14:02] message years ago they said that you
[1:14:04] know what they said we take acts 238 for
[1:14:07] our baptism the denominations takes
[1:14:10] Matthew 28:19 for their I said no way I
[1:14:14] said if they'd take Matthew 28:19 for
[1:14:17] their baptism I'll be glad to go along
[1:14:20] with them because it plainly tells you
[1:14:22] it is the Lord Jesus Christ Father Son
[1:14:24] and Holy Ghost is Lord Jesus
[1:14:26] Christ so you see that's why people
[1:14:29] don't want to
[1:14:33] talk but the age that you and I are
[1:14:35] living in
[1:14:37] see it's this message that will change
[1:14:40] our bodies well how come you don't know
[1:14:43] this message
[1:14:46] verbatim how come you don't spend your
[1:14:48] time listening to this
[1:14:51] message reading you know we listen to T
[1:14:55] that which way you want to go don't get
[1:14:56] all tied up with
[1:14:59] me how come you don't
[1:15:01] know you know it's a shame now listen
[1:15:06] it's a shame after all of these years
[1:15:09] that you got to say and read that
[1:15:11] brother rown said
[1:15:19] it it's a shame
[1:15:25] do you
[1:15:26] mean that I've got to prove that there's
[1:15:31] one
[1:15:39] God I thought that we believe they
[1:15:41] wouldn't but one God I thought we
[1:15:43] believe they wouldn't but one Holy Ghost
[1:15:44] I thought we believe they wouldn't but
[1:15:45] one truth One Faith one Lord one
[1:15:49] baptism and I've got to prove to you
[1:15:51] there one
[1:15:53] God you know the reason I have to do
[1:15:55] that cuz there's so many proving it
[1:15:57] contrary
[1:16:02] amen but that's a
[1:16:10] shame I don't have no problems with you
[1:16:12] saying brother Dale where did he say
[1:16:13] that at if I quote you something I don't
[1:16:15] have no problem cuz I'll find
[1:16:20] it you know you ever thought about using
[1:16:22] gifs in a way of understanding a lot you
[1:16:25] know that I was sitting there the other
[1:16:26] night and I knew that I had made a
[1:16:28] statement to uh say that uh brother
[1:16:32] Brandon we were talking about the
[1:16:33] messengers and the thing and that
[1:16:35] brother bandam had said that it that you
[1:16:38] know it's not the time or the thing but
[1:16:41] it's the man who is the most prevalent
[1:16:44] for the age it's not whether he comes at
[1:16:48] but he's the messenger to the age chosen
[1:16:50] by the Holy Spirit I knew that quote was
[1:16:52] there
[1:16:55] and I sat there and I thought how can I
[1:16:57] get it I ran it this way I ran it that
[1:17:00] way I ran it this
[1:17:02] way after a while I sat there and I said
[1:17:05] yeah I know let's
[1:17:07] see that quote
[1:17:11] is and I just typ the words
[1:17:15] in and there it come
[1:17:18] up we should have a memory of the things
[1:17:22] of the message is my point
[1:17:27] I used to go to brother Mo and I'd say
[1:17:28] brother Mo what is uh where's the
[1:17:30] scripture that says so and so well he
[1:17:34] just right I come on folks I have
[1:17:38] trouble spelling let Al on anything
[1:17:41] else you ever looked up something in the
[1:17:43] computer and you spell it
[1:17:45] wrong first time we hooked up the
[1:17:48] computer first time I got a hold of it
[1:17:50] me and Anna was doing it she was putting
[1:17:52] it in for me and doing cuz I didn't know
[1:17:53] how to do it and that was the old days
[1:17:55] you had to put them in took you two days
[1:17:57] to get it all to come in you know and uh
[1:17:59] so we got it all done and uh she said
[1:18:03] well we run a run a check now I said
[1:18:05] okay let's let's do this let's just see
[1:18:07] and I put tapped in what I thought was
[1:18:13] serpant how do you spell it s e r p e n
[1:18:17] t and I put a n because that's what it
[1:18:20] sounds like don't it and it come up with
[1:18:23] a big old Z zero
[1:18:25] y I said I spent
[1:18:28] $3,500 and we spent two days running
[1:18:30] this sucker in and that dummy don't know
[1:18:32] what I know I know brother brandham said
[1:18:35] serpent thousands of thousands of
[1:18:40] times and I said Daddy resell
[1:18:45] it
[1:18:47] right you
[1:18:49] know see if it hadn't I'd have went away
[1:18:51] probably just trying to send a sucker
[1:18:53] back where I got it
[1:18:56] from but listen Church see we don't have
[1:18:59] to look for something else that's right
[1:19:03] you don't get nothing out of the message
[1:19:04] you didn't get nothing Wednesday night
[1:19:05] don't and don't get nothing they get one
[1:19:07] thing we don't have to depend on
[1:19:10] something
[1:19:11] else we depend upon the holy
[1:19:15] spirit I've got my book setting brother
[1:19:18] Mo taught it years ago he had every book
[1:19:20] we'd carry them in the back of his car
[1:19:22] and he had every one of them sitting in
[1:19:25] volumes and I said okay that's the way
[1:19:27] to do it my mes all of my books are
[1:19:30] sitting in
[1:19:34] volumes and all I got to do is take that
[1:19:36] little old blue greenish looking now
[1:19:38] book and there it says so and so there
[1:19:41] it is I go there it is you know I still
[1:19:44] use them a
[1:19:45] lot you know a lot of times when I have
[1:19:47] a question about what brother around say
[1:19:49] I know I can find it in those
[1:19:53] books right
[1:19:55] well I can find in the
[1:19:58] computer go ahead you take you days but
[1:20:01] I just have think well brother around
[1:20:03] said that home future
[1:20:06] home
[1:20:08] yep and I just pulled the book out
[1:20:11] and and there it is underline or most of
[1:20:14] the time wrote up on the front of it if
[1:20:15] you seen any of my
[1:20:17] books what are you getting that I'm
[1:20:20] getting it one
[1:20:21] thing I thought we had one message
[1:20:24] right I thought we had one Messenger to
[1:20:27] bring us one
[1:20:30] message I thought that was the order of
[1:20:32] God's
[1:20:35] word
[1:20:39] right to go to the message for the
[1:20:45] answer cuz the messenger came exactly
[1:20:48] the way it's supposed
[1:20:50] to I gave you the quotes where he said
[1:20:53] this one would stand where between lady
[1:20:56] osia and
[1:21:00] Eternity
[1:21:03] yep first service I preached right here
[1:21:05] in this building going Beyond man's
[1:21:09] count that was the first service in
[1:21:13] 1971 going Beyond man's
[1:21:16] Camp
[1:21:18] what you know the Bible speaks of him
[1:21:20] being outside the gate and it's you're
[1:21:22] and I are got to go out to where he's at
[1:21:25] now let him come where we at no we all
[1:21:28] tried that didn't we we all tried
[1:21:30] staying in them denominations and the
[1:21:32] churches we was in and tried to help the
[1:21:34] people didn't we which is good that's
[1:21:36] fine but you don't realizing all the
[1:21:38] whole time it wasn't there
[1:21:43] right we got to go where he's
[1:21:48] at see there's not another message to
[1:21:50] take you and I to eternal life that's
[1:21:52] right it's either in this prophet's
[1:21:55] message or we missed the whole
[1:22:00] time you say well that's putting too
[1:22:02] much on the man well if you're listening
[1:22:04] like that you're in bad shape cuz I put
[1:22:06] every bit of my emphasis on almighty God
[1:22:09] right almighty God promised to send you
[1:22:12] and I a messenger in this
[1:22:15] age and he sent
[1:22:18] it well you mean all them denominations
[1:22:20] are
[1:22:22] wrong if they turn down the
[1:22:26] word they wrong that's right I like
[1:22:29] brother Wood's way of saying it he said
[1:22:31] if my mother is a
[1:22:33] liar he said that years ago he said you
[1:22:37] know what said she ain't no difference
[1:22:38] than any other
[1:22:41] liar I don't want you tell my mother if
[1:22:43] your mother's a liar ain't no difference
[1:22:45] no other a
[1:22:46] liar what's the difference God is your
[1:22:50] mother we all love our parents right
[1:22:52] that's right
[1:22:55] what if brother Brandon would stayed
[1:22:57] with his mother when his mother used to
[1:22:58] tell him about serpent seeds and
[1:23:00] something like didn't believe and all
[1:23:01] that stuff when he would come out and
[1:23:02] started preaching you know she
[1:23:07] didn't in which you used to tell him
[1:23:09] that hell was
[1:23:12] eternal you think she didn't tell him a
[1:23:14] lot them things he must have he he
[1:23:16] talked about
[1:23:19] it but
[1:23:21] listen when we talk about the messenger
[1:23:23] coming at the end of the AG now watch it
[1:23:26] watch your seed and we'll pick it
[1:23:27] up that means that you got a certain
[1:23:30] place to put something now my wife is
[1:23:33] real good at it she's got a place for
[1:23:40] everything and that's well and
[1:23:43] good until she gets into my
[1:23:50] place and she thinks it all ought to be
[1:23:53] this way
[1:23:56] and I go looking for it and can't find
[1:23:58] it cuz it ain't in the place I left
[1:24:02] it I'm not saying she's
[1:24:05] wrong I'm
[1:24:08] saying we just need or reorganizing you
[1:24:11] know to get everything
[1:24:14] straight but you see the message is
[1:24:17] already been brought it's in place what
[1:24:21] are you and I waiting on
[1:24:24] that's
[1:24:26] right I've been playing from day one
[1:24:30] whatever you're looking forward
[1:24:32] to out there on the Internet or sitting
[1:24:34] in here wherever whatever you're looking
[1:24:36] forward to or think it's got to come
[1:24:38] remember there's got to be an order
[1:24:41] before it can
[1:24:43] come
[1:24:47] right I can quote scripture you know the
[1:24:51] children of Israel had to be crying for
[1:24:53] a deliverer before the deliverer was
[1:24:58] sent what caused the deliverer to be
[1:25:03] sent well then getting in this message
[1:25:06] and getting everything set in order of
[1:25:10] understanding is a preparation for
[1:25:12] anything else you could think about that
[1:25:14] would come that's
[1:25:16] right that's all I've ever tried to
[1:25:19] do get us ready
[1:25:26] then whatever God wants to send he can
[1:25:27] send it but if we ain't ready where
[1:25:30] we're going to be that's right amen well
[1:25:33] how do you get ready getting in the
[1:25:37] message getting in the Statue of a
[1:25:39] perfect
[1:25:40] man and study it to see if we have those
[1:25:43] virtues if not we'll to work on
[1:25:46] that
[1:25:49] right getting into the point of
[1:25:51] recognizing who we are and what we're
[1:25:52] doing that's right
[1:25:55] in the hour that we're living upon the
[1:25:57] Earth
[1:26:00] okay
[1:26:05] yeah see they can't be no more
[1:26:11] ages and we've got to admit we're at the
[1:26:13] End of the Age amen irregardless of
[1:26:17] anything you want to talk about or
[1:26:19] whatever you want to make we've got to
[1:26:21] admit We're In the End of the Age amen
[1:26:30] then according to the prophet God's
[1:26:31] waiting on you and I is that his
[1:26:37] words come on we'll get under the
[1:26:39] message later I got to laying on the Des
[1:26:41] what there's got to be a Ministry of
[1:26:42] Jesus Christ on the earth before he'll
[1:26:46] come
[1:26:52] back yeah
[1:26:56] I believe we're looking at the ministry
[1:26:57] of Jesus Christ go may I say one more
[1:27:00] thing before closing what we're looking
[1:27:03] for a lot of
[1:27:05] times what was it brother Joe was just
[1:27:07] quoting this morning me and him was
[1:27:09] talking when you think you got
[1:27:11] everything figured
[1:27:12] out just remember you don't have it
[1:27:16] figured out that's right that's the best
[1:27:18] way to say it right when you think you
[1:27:21] got it figured
[1:27:22] out you know God just does his
[1:27:26] way and he you know he don't call us up
[1:27:29] and ask us is it all right to do it he
[1:27:32] just does it his
[1:27:34] way and we say well this is figured out
[1:27:36] well that's that's okay we say it can't
[1:27:39] be no other way whether you better be
[1:27:41] standing in the right
[1:27:43] place when you say it can't be no other
[1:27:46] way why can't we at least stand on that
[1:27:49] of the message it can't be no other way
[1:27:51] of another Messenger to come that's
[1:27:53] right
[1:27:56] right it can't be another Messenger to
[1:27:59] come how long would it take him to go
[1:28:02] back and preach to these people I me
[1:28:04] talking about another Messenger to come
[1:28:06] an eighth day messenger or some kind of
[1:28:08] a guy that's got how long would it take
[1:28:10] for him to preach the
[1:28:17] truth
[1:28:22] right you you see because your messenger
[1:28:26] the only thing that he does is he points
[1:28:30] you to
[1:28:32] Christ he can't be your
[1:28:35] Christ amen right may I quote a man was
[1:28:39] listening to the other day many of May
[1:28:41] heard I I don't remember the wording but
[1:28:43] I mean the man's name but he said that
[1:28:46] uh he said I he was a great F brother R
[1:28:49] was talking about he said a great friend
[1:28:50] friend of or Roberts he said I thought
[1:28:52] if I ever get sick I'll just go to Old
[1:28:55] Robert and he'll pray for
[1:28:57] me he said so I ain't going to worry
[1:28:59] about
[1:29:01] it he said get sick I go to him he pray
[1:29:04] and God heal him he said one day he got
[1:29:09] sick he know well I'll just go to or
[1:29:11] Robert he goes to or Roberts he prays
[1:29:14] for him he said he got the feeling
[1:29:15] better he said okay praise God got it he
[1:29:18] said a day or so later or something he
[1:29:19] said he's sick again you may remember
[1:29:22] the story he goes back to brother
[1:29:24] Roberts he prayed and he said feel and
[1:29:26] there to ladies right
[1:29:28] back and said brother Robert said what
[1:29:31] you need to do is go to brother brandom
[1:29:33] and find out something's wrong here so
[1:29:35] you need to go find
[1:29:36] out brother brandom said he sat down
[1:29:39] with a man and went through
[1:29:43] everything he said I couldn't find no
[1:29:47] way to tell him what he needed to
[1:29:51] do he said I couldn't find anything find
[1:29:54] something to that paraphrase it but he
[1:29:56] couldn't find anything any answer from
[1:30:00] God he said the man got worse and worse
[1:30:04] and
[1:30:07] worse the man said well what am I going
[1:30:09] to do I've been to or Robert I've been
[1:30:10] to brother brandom said What Can I Do
[1:30:13] Lord said finally he just stopped and he
[1:30:16] said
[1:30:18] Lord I just need to turn to you
[1:30:25] he
[1:30:25] said he got
[1:30:28] healed cuz you see God was letting him
[1:30:31] know what he had too much emphasis upon
[1:30:35] the man of or Roberts and Billy
[1:30:38] Graham he needed his emphasis on him all
[1:30:41] that other was well and
[1:30:42] good but it won't work when God's trying
[1:30:45] to get you
[1:30:46] attention that's right no matter what
[1:30:49] contacts you've
[1:30:51] got it won't work if God's trying to get
[1:30:54] your attention that's
[1:30:55] right cuz you can pray you can do all
[1:30:57] you want to it ain't going to work till
[1:31:01] he gets through with
[1:31:06] you I want God to come and help
[1:31:09] me
[1:31:15] okay why not just yield oursel to him
[1:31:18] let him take care of it right come on
[1:31:22] musicians what do we got
[1:31:24] a
[1:31:25] message a man has brought the message y
[1:31:29] we're not looking for another man to
[1:31:31] come and bring us another message
[1:31:34] no and according to Galatians
[1:31:39] 1:8 if a man come to bring us a message
[1:31:43] that was contrary to this
[1:31:47] message then according to the Bible it
[1:31:50] is to let them be accursed right
[1:31:54] I think this is the way it ought to be I
[1:31:55] think this what I think it's what I
[1:31:57] think it's what brother Brown meant
[1:31:59] that's all right but let him be a
[1:32:05] cursed what about it
[1:32:08] folks can you see right where this
[1:32:11] messenger stands we'll take this
[1:32:12] afternoon where the Prophet is talking
[1:32:14] about that he comes in a lap
[1:32:17] over God Made A Way God made it to the
[1:32:20] right
[1:32:21] place he put everything in the right
[1:32:27] order he says an open
[1:32:31] door but what we got to do find the
[1:32:38] door
[1:32:42] right just remember this statement until
[1:32:45] probably Wednesday night remember no
[1:32:48] bride has ever been in an
[1:32:52] age she's called out of the age into
[1:32:57] Jesus Christ physically we are still in
[1:33:00] lady
[1:33:01] OA right spiritually we're called out
[1:33:06] into

[1:33:24] need this world just had that on my mind
[1:33:27] to think about it I'm just are we really
[1:33:30] thinking about the messenger
[1:33:32] com
[1:33:33] laid somewhere beyond the
[1:33:38] importance we see where he
[1:33:40] came open and I came at home in this
[1:33:46] world if he came back under we better
[1:33:48] get back to Lord you know I have no
[1:33:53] friend like

[1:34:03] expected what to be thank God for the
[1:34:08] truth world
[1:34:12] anymore they're all expecting me and
[1:34:16] that's one thing I know I fixed it up
[1:34:20] with Jesus so many years ago go I know
[1:34:25] he'll see me through though I am weak
[1:34:29] and more and I can't feel at home in
[1:34:33] this world
[1:34:35] anymore well oh Lord you know could have
[1:34:38] been very very
[1:34:40] dangerous could have been death anywhere

[1:35:18] things she can tell you the things that
[1:35:21] happened you know and just you know what
[1:35:23] happens with

[1:35:33] everywhere t a lot of things but yet
[1:35:36] they were all right that was the main
[1:35:38] thing she said it' have messed up the
[1:35:40] hearing of the dog that they had his
[1:35:43] ears and things so we just pray that the
[1:35:45] Lord will touch the dog and make it make
[1:35:47] his hearing okay but we thank God for
[1:35:50] being with
[1:35:51] them to take care of them cuz you don't
[1:35:54] want lightning striking around you you

[1:36:34] dismissed remember the service this
[1:36:36] evening Lord you know I have no friend
[1:36:40] like you if Heaven's not my home then
[1:36:44] Lord what will I do the Angels backing
[1:36:49] me from Heaven's open door and I can't
[1:36:53] feel at home in this world anymore
