========================================

[Music] let the worshiper arise [Music] i surrender to the trust that's our desire this morning thank you musicians you may take your place i trust that's our desire this morning is to worship the king of kings the great i am if there was ever someone that should be worshiped ever someone who was so great that needed to be worshipped it was him jesus christ the lamb of god amen he's worthy he's a great king you know it says that i think it's in the book of micah or malachi because it's a minor prophet that starts with m so it's one of those two and he says i am the great king and you know when when god says i am the great king like if i were to stand up here this morning and say i am a great preacher now some of you would be like well yeah you know i've heard him before he's not too bad and some of you be like that brother is conceited he's arrogant and he probably needs to be taken down a couple pegs but when god says i am the great king it is just a statement of truth he is not being arrogant he is not being prideful he is merely stating exactly what he is amen i'm just happy to be here with you let's go ahead and we'll turn and we'll read our first scripture luke chapter 16 verse 16 and then we'll also look at philippians chapter 3. um and then maybe i'll make a introduction for those who don't know me maybe so luke chapter 16 verse 16 the law and the prophets were until john since that time the kingdom of god is preached and every man presses into it if we look at philippians chapter 3 verses 14 and 15 here uh actually starting with verse 13. we will start philippians chapter 3 and verse 13 brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if any if in anything he be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you nevertheless one two we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing and can we just bow our heads for a word of prayer heavenly father lord you are the great king you're worthy and you're wonderful you're worthy of all of our praise the the thoughts of our heart our meditations all that we are lord truly belongs to you and we count you worthy to receive it lord father we've asked your presence in this building and lord we know you've promised it by your word where two or three are gathered in the name well that that you'd be there so father i pray that you'd open our eyes and our hearts to see you to know you to feel you to know that you're here father not not just to know the promise intellectually lord but may we father may that promise be a reality to us this morning that we would know you were here father just anoint me to speak lord jesus that your words go forth and accomplish the thing that you send it to do father i pray that it would encourage and challenge strengthen the believers lord jesus but ultimately lord if if you could just commune with the heart of every believer here lord that then lord we'll just thank you for that lord that would be so much lord that would be better than the best sermon i've ever preached in my life lord if you would just be here and you would take control and you would have your way father for lord we we surrender our all as we just saying to you lord we love you you're so good and worthy in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated so we're just happy to be here um and um we we seem to we seem to have about an eight year cycle we were here about eight years ago and then about eight years before that so maybe you met us a little while ago and we've been friends with different ones here for um quite some time and have enjoyed it and met different ones and we had a nice time of fellowship yesterday um and went up to the beautiful falls up there and had a great time but i'm brother trevor my last name is eamond some people think trevor is my last name but trevor's my first name i usually go by just brother trevor because trying to say even usually ends up coming out edmond and you know and then some brothers just say it like that on purpose and then you know and because that's kind of church this is i've been picking up on you know it's a it's a difficult place here you know god god bless you people you know you make it hard on yourselves but you know so uh but uh just happy to be here and to be with you all brought my family my wife anime zion azariah and gloriana are here we'll we'll have a song this evening um with the afternoon service for you all um and i was just thankful the lord lord gave me i love to worship and the lord gave me a family that came worship with us and and i was telling the brother you know brother wade yesterday just how as the lord has progressed and we've progressed as a family and brought up and you know we had a we had our time where we had to kind of shut the church down for covid but at the same weekend uh um brother jack had come up brother jack duff from florida had come up to the service and brother nathan the pastor wasn't sure if he had it so he thought man i better stay away and so brother trevor you're gonna have to just run things this weekend so we shut the service you know everything down we brought a song leader my family and brother jack and his family and you know we so what that that what that gave us was that was me and i could introduce the brother and we had a a piano player and zion and he could play piano for the song service and then my son azariah ran the stream and you know we just and the song leader was like boy brother trevor you know you could you just you're just a church in a box your family you know and my wife's sunday school teacher and my daughter wants to become a sunday school teacher and so i just praise the lord and so um and we got a drummer too i forgot ezra plays the drums so we had a drummer there too and we just you know we could just have a service so i love to worship the lord and i'm thankful the lord gave me gave me the pieces around me to just worship the lord anytime so as a brother riley from kentucky used to say you know if if there's no believers around you then raise you some so [Laughter] so it's kind of hard for me to think say things like that raise you some that's not exactly you know the kind of english i usually talk so i hope that my my northern ways aren't too uh you know don't get lost in translation but you know i feel like i'm i'm quite a southerner compared to where i used to be i um i moved down to indiana southern indiana so we're right across there from kentucky and um you know i started working at the airport in lexington kentucky when i first moved down i was born in minnesota and lived out minnesota and south dakota so i sounded you know i sounded a little different we said minnesota that's where i was from minnesota and so i've lost you know much my accent that i used to have up there and so now you can understand me much better so you know i go back home and people like he has a southern accent you probably think like this guy's a yankee you know so i guess i'm not welcome anywhere but you know but that's who we are and um you know we've um uh we were at the branham tabernacle for about 20 years now we're fellowshipping with brother nathan bryant um at church of the open door in new albany and just enjoying the fellowship of the saints enjoying the preaching of the word and and praising the lord so just happy to be gathered in the name of the lord jesus christ happy to be following a prophet that god sent us in this last day and that's how i was raised you know i was i was raised on the tapes and so that's what i know so i didn't go to seminary i didn't learn theology anywhere but just this message so well praise the lord so hopefully that can just calm me down just a little bit because maybe some of you are thinking this brother's from where he's from jeffersonville and he's he's a yankee from jeffersonville and he used to go to the tabernacle and i don't know what he's going to preach to us now well just calm down it'll be okay because if you got the holy ghost you got the filter you don't you don't have to sit there and go oh my goodness what's he going to preach what's going to break you know it's like just rest in christ so praise the lord we're just happy um happy to be here very happy to be here so press the mark is my title and on my notes here you know i know you've heard 100 sermons on pressing um and and i'm different than many preachers that you've probably ever heard so on my notes it's pressed the mark and mark is underlined and so we really want to talk about the mark because if you're going to press to the mark well it might be helpful to know what that mark is you know it's like oh brother i've been pressing two yeah right right right pressing hard as a christian like yay for you that's great what's the point what are you doing where is it getting you to and that's what we want to talk about is what is that mark what are we what are we moving towards and brother branham in the message desperation says every man presses into it not simply walks into it easily but it has to be pressed into now when you seek me with all your heart then i'll be found i can tell you you know as i was seeking the holy ghost and you know as a young man easter sunday 1997 i was in the service all my friends all the brothers were at the altar after service and i was standing in the back going lord you know should i be at the altar and have i you know i feel like i've you know i've been going to prayer meeting i've been you know living fairly good and and the lord said well what about that girlfriend you've got it's like yeah i guess that she's not exactly a believer is she and so standing right there i said lord okay i'll give that one to you too and that's when the lord filled me with the holy ghost why because then it was with all my heart that's when i gave him all that's when i fully subjected myself to the word of god and i said fine lord you know that's it's okay whatever you want for me that's fine and you know when we get to a place where we can surrender all man that's when the lord really began that's what we press into is pressing fully into christ to surrender all to recognize that everything i am is you know essentially worthless if it's not without him or if it's without him i must have him i've got to press into him and i've got to seek him with all my heart but let's look here for a moment at what paul is speaking to us here in philippians chapter 3 you know verse 13 he says i count not myself to have apprehended the first church age messenger you know the one who wrote 80 percent of the new testament he hasn't apprehended yet man if he hasn't apprehended boy we in trouble brothers and sisters what are we going to do because you know how many of you has god given an affliction that he won't that he won't deliver you from because you have too much revelation because that was paul's state like you know i you know god said no you're going to have this he said because of the abundance of the revelation so he needed something to keep him humble but this man with so much revelation that he has an affliction to keep him humble has not yet apprehended so i think there's a case that maybe just maybe we should still be pressing but what should we be pressing towards well towards whatever paul was pressing towards that he had not yet apprehended and now don't get discouraged you think boy paul hasn't got it with all of his up you know who am i what am i gonna do hey you're never gonna attain well we'll talk about that but but but can you can you attain all of god you say brother trevor then we're gonna be pressing the whole time yeah brother trevor won't that get exhausting no no because the more you press into christ and the more you attain of christ the more you recognize there's so much more to have and you you could get discouraged but then but then you remember like wait there's no discouragement it's not like it's not like the pressing that i've done has all been in vain all it's done was was make me have a greater vision of christ which made me realize there was more to press into but i'm not going to get discouraged about that i'm happy when i recognize i learn that there's more of christ than i ever thought why because he's wonderful because he's great because everything that is good or lovely or perfect and wonderful in this world is him and when i recognize there's more of that to go around brother that makes me pretty happy that i get to continue to press into that oh it's it's wonderful you know we have we have we have uh you know they've done these studies these um you can read about them these reports you know and you know 60 years ago the cartoons you know if you maybe you remember steamboat willie or mickey or whatever it was you know you got you got a mouse on a piano you know how long that scene stays with a mouse on a piano well in today's time man it's a long time that scene stays there with a mouse playing a piano for like 30 seconds you watch any cartoon today there's there is no scene for 30 seconds there there's probably no scene for three seconds it's gotta change because it's got to keep the interest of the people but we serve a god who's so amazing he's so unchanging but the reality of it is is the more that the more you stay there the more you just look at his unchanging presence the more you find out how great he is he doesn't get boring you say brother trevor well i mean i appreciate this is church and everything i know that that's what you preach and that's what we should amen and that's yeah but brother trevor like if i'm honest i'm kind of bored sometimes amen anybody else or just just brother trevor like yeah it happens doesn't it it happens and when that happens it's not that you know and then when that happens then you're like why should i press you know it's kind of boring and i get kind of it's work to keep pressing what's because the it's because the mark is wrong right there you go it's because you you were pressing to the wrong mark and that's a problem you think but yeah but i get it now like no no paul didn't apprehend so if you're sitting there thinking well i apprehended and i pretty much got this christian thing down you're missing something you you you you set a mark here but the mark is way up there and you feel like i've reached it i don't need to keep pressing and it's it's getting kind of boring and it's getting kind of old and it's just kind of man i've been doing the thing for five 10 15 years and i'm there and it's just kind of you know huh every sunday every wednesday it's the wrong mark and i hope that the spirit can challenge you today to find the mark of the high calling in christ jesus and it's not just that it's christ jesus but it's that you have a high calling in christ jesus it's that he's so great and he's calling you to come unto him he's then lifted up that you would be drawn to him and as you're drawn to him you have a calling and you have a purpose and there's something for you to do and sometimes when a preacher tells you that it's just like yeah i get more work to do but again you're missing something because jesus is calling you and when he calls you to come unto him and when he calls you to a purpose and to serve him what he's calling you know look without a purpose what do you have right what are you living for well i you know i'm i'm living for caramel apples up there in helen well okay you know if that's your mark and that's your purpose and then but you talk about getting old after a while you gotta drive an hour to get a caramel apple it you know every sunday i draw my no i don't know what it is for you but when you begin to recognize that when when god begins to give you the purpose and begins to give you something to do there's absolute joy in serving him there's absolute joy because there's purpose because there's meaning because if all you're doing is coming and sitting in a church and going yeah brother trevor i'm kind of getting tired of the press the mark sermons well well you know i pressed and i've done the thing and here i am what do you want me to do i want you to see that the mark is so much higher because you set the mark here you hit it and suddenly you're not happy anymore suddenly there's no joy anymore and if there's no joy in your life how is god gonna use you because i'll remind you in nehemiah it says the joy of the lord is your strength if you're gonna have strength to fight the battle you're gonna have to tap into your strength which is the joy of the lord [Music] you say brother trevor i can't just turn the joy switch on no you can't but you can you can dive into him you can find the source of the joy because it's real amen you say brother trevor no no caramel apples is joy brother trevor is it what so then if caramel apples are joy and i'm just using that because it's something local that we just you know we could talk about ice cream usually that's what i say brother brother luis is like okay ice cream is joy so so if ice cream is joy what happens when you don't have ice cream right do you have no joy you say brother trevor see the problem is is is jesus is not tangible enough to bring me joy ice cream is tangible enough to bring me joy you know what you know what the world tries to trust you know apart from just the fact that you have no joy if you have no ice cream in your life and that's kind of a sad miserable existence you know come on somebody you know and so so so the problem is is that that we then we start looking at the things that the world calls joy you know relationships you know good or bad um you know uh beauty you know what whatever it might be that you you would find that the world calls joy i want you to think like let's let's talk about okay romantic movies you know these romantic comedies and different things you know it's just like oh i wish i could have a relationship like that that would bring me joy it's scripted this didn't really happen somebody like wrote this and then they acted it out so is it real or not is it tangible or not it's not okay if you know if i was so beautiful boy then i'd really have joy and you look at all the magazine covers and let me ask you are the girls on the front of the magazine cover are they real or not you say brother trevor of course they took a picture it's a real person that's a real yeah but then they took it through photoshop and layer upon layer of filter and all the makeup and the hair and the fans blowing the hair back and all of this stuff like what it and then they say this is how you should look and if you can look like this this will be joy what are they doing telling you something that's not real is joy hey you know yeah sisters i'm sorry but man you just don't have that you know your neck will never be long enough because they take those you know they take the women's heads on those pictures and they stretch that neck to make it look good because guess what it says and what is it isaiah something about outstretched necks well here we go so that look what they're portraying isn't real it's not real you say i need something real jesus isn't real enough jesus isn't tangible enough to bring me joy but everything else out there that that the world would try to tell you is joy is not real so you can't say like these things are real no they're not real jesus isn't real enough but these things are real enough no everything the world tries to give you that's that to give you joy is not real it's not good enough without alteration on its own but jesus christ is good enough without alteration on his own always will be always was and is right now and that that's not not just true that's not just good theology but it is reality but you you see you see the ice cream that you say that's real i can feel it i can taste it but but but again will you take it away what you have to say then is that there is no joy apart from that apart from the thing i have so obviously joy is something that's a little bit more intangible than just the reality so-called of ice cream there's got to be something on the inside that is joy there's a knowledge there's a truth and there's a purpose that can bring you into the joy of the lord and it's worth having the problem is is that we bring the mark down and then we hit that mark and go i'm good man sunday morning bro here we are what's gonna happen today probably the same thing that happened last sunday brother joe gonna sing again okay that's nice man can we sing a new song i am just man you all should have gone to the tabernacle for 20 years let's sing number one in the hymnal higher ground opening song 20 years straight praise god but hey i am pressing onto higher ground [Applause] so the problem is is that we bring the mark down so low that we hit that mark and when we hit that mark there's no purpose anymore there's nothing for us to do there's nothing in it for us we just you know we have to just continue to remind ourselves i'm saved by the grace of god and i don't even remember what that is now anymore but you know i mean it's been so long since i've been a sinner and i've attained some you know 20 years ago i attained you know the holy ghost and now i've just been you know coming to church and i mean what else do i do we'll get your mark a little higher i don't understand why these brothers keep telling us the press i did the pressing i got to the altar i got the holy ghost hey i got the ticket in my hand i'm going there like what what do you want from us preachers i want you to set the mark higher because if you set the mark higher and you recognize there's so much more out there for you man suddenly joy can start coming back and recognizing there is more for me and if there's more for me then he wants me to do more and then i begin to recognize hang on a second wait a second did i just say he wants me he wants me to do something brother zach he wants you to do something for him he has purpose for you can can we even say that you know i and you know i want to you all understand this the right way but can we even say that god needs you he has no hands but our hands he has no lips but our lips my goodness if god's going to walk around on two shoes or those johnston murphys he's gonna walk around in zach's johnston murphys god needs him god needs you he has a purpose and a high calling for you a high calling in christ jesus he doesn't want you to stop he doesn't want you to have attained he wants you to recognize that there's something higher out there for you that can inspire you can draw you up and then as you grow into it it begins to open up and you begin to recognize how wonderful this thing truly is and that it's not sitting on a pew for 20 years waiting on jesus to come but there's an action to it there's a purpose to it there's a there's an excitement to it because man i don't know how it's going to happen and sometimes it's hard yeah but man sometimes god shows up in that and it's awesome amen oh inspiring amen wonderful and you begin to recognize it's not just me it's not just small little me that doesn't mean anything that can't make an impact on this world i'm just me and i'm just waiting for jesus to come and i can't wait and okay great but then you begin to recognize no i'm part of something much bigger and that god desires me that god uniquely gifted me and called me and and oh glory to god you know the ephesian age brother branham tells us that that they had high aspirations that they aimed high but then they began to be relaxed and they left their first love but originally it was good because they aimed high now you see what did they aim at they there was a mark that they were they were aiming at you know and and and you see you know sister olivia she could tell us all about it right she could tell us about hitting the mark yeah right this is yup yup sitting on the back row looking really embarrassed right about now already to god brother trevor doesn't usually pick on the people in the back row he usually picks on zach in the front row and then the pastor's over here and then yeah maybe brother luis will get some but i ain't picking on this too because boy that's going to hurt later so sorry olivia so so olivia can tell you after service about hitting a mark and the farther back you get you know the smaller that mark gets that's kind of interesting you know when you get farther away that mark is small but when you get closer and closer and closer that mark gets bigger and bigger and it starts to look a whole lot better doesn't it doesn't it and so the closer and closer you get to christ you start recognizing that mark that's getting a whole lot better i might actually hit that thing because back here that mark's awful tiny yeah but guess what happens you see because we want to know like wait brother trevor i get you know we sure theologically we understand what you're saying like purpose brings joy and all that that's that's nice i appreciate that you know it's like like a school teacher right now or something i don't know but but i don't really feel it so let's just break it down for just a moment so so when sister olivia you know she she doesn't just i'm going to win an archery tournament because she saw bow and arrow no she's got to do something doesn't she what you got to do got to practice got to practice gotta practice and the reason you're practicing is because at some some point in time you want to become something right you want to she's like stop talking to me like goodness sakes but at some point in time you want to become something what is it you would like to become through the use of your practicing i'm going to guess that you want to be a good archer yeah and so i'm practicing because because you know to be a good archer well there's a definition of what that is you know if the mark is over there and you go whap that brother is a bad archer and you should be nowhere near he is so bad you see there's a definition of what a good archer is the good archer is the one that gets back here pulls it back real steady flexes the shoulder a little bit the arrow goes and it hits the mark and the smaller the mark is and the more centrally they hit the mark and the farther back they get in can't hit it guess what that means they're good at it olivia you like being good at it is that boring i bet you're real happy when you hit the mark and you win a tournament right i bet you there's some like joy in your heart because you recognize that that though it was hard that though some competition sometimes was stiff that i had to spend time in practice i had to put i had to put effort into it but yet i recognized that that there was a trophy there there was there was a martin and the trophy man it doesn't like they're plastic they cost 15 at you know bob's awards store like who cares but what does the trophy symbolize okay maybe you get the one that's got marble on the bottom so it's heavy but that's the only reason it's still plastic and maybe that one costs 60 good for you looks the same as the 15 one when it sits on the shelf now you're just putting more stress on the studs but what does the trophy mean the trophy is a symbol that you conquered that you achieved something a mark that that you practiced and that there was something that you attained and so when you get the trophy at the regionals you know then you go on to to compete in state and then you begin to compete in nationals and then you get to compete at world and guess what every time you're like man i thought things were great when i run regionals but then when i won state boy that was a party man that was amazing and then you go on and you win in the nation what did it take it took more effort it took more practice it took a pressing into that more and more and more but at each stage that they got to the joy was increased until you know some point in time two or three years later the trophy sitting there you're going i can't even remember what that felt like but guess what it isn't like that with jesus christ but we'll spend time pressing to get to that joy to get to that purpose to get to that definition to say i'm good at this but then jesus christ and who gives joy and it's not just a trophy on the shelf but it's an eternal joy that he places doubt on your heart it's a hope and a peace and an assurance and just an absolute bliss in jesus christ and we're like well but you know he gave me the holy ghost and i'm i mean i'm just coming to church now and then we wonder like these presses mark sermons are just old that's why i'm not telling you to press if what i can do is tell you what the mark is if what i can do is aspire inspire you that the mark is so much higher than you then then maybe you're letting it be right now then you'll be you'll just you'll look and go wow that's amazing and i want that and it'll give you purpose it'll give you joy when it gives you joy it'll give you strength to to achieve the purpose that god wants to use you for because god wants zach in his johnston murphys i'm not real sure they're justin murphy's but they kind of look like it but he wants zach to walk around and manifest and represent jesus christ to this dying generation and god wants you to do it and he doesn't want oh we're going to get there man maybe i'll get to my notes i don't know maybe we try to keep this logically oriented we can then you all know what i'm saying here so when's the last time you pressed when's the last time you could say brother trevor i i've been pressing lately oh don't preach tonight sermon brother trevor just keep that back keep that back what time is it and what time we got here 11 okay because we got to have lunch i was instructed yes what do you got just a little bit there you're welcome are we happy in the lord praise the lord are we happy in the technology okay so the problem is you know that we have sometimes is is because to the people here who are saying like i like what this brother's preaching and that's all great and there's some people are like yeah i still he hadn't got me yet he hadn't convinced me yet because what he's telling me is that i'll never achieve paul never achieved man and that just sounds you know what he's telling me is that i never get to take my foot off the gas that i never get to stop and enjoy and smell the flowers that's i think that's being strict but i'm not saying that there's not periods of time where we rest and we rejuvenate we rest in christ anyway you know maybe somebody's thinking you know this is just a carrot on the stick brother trevor that's the problem with you with you preachers you just tear it out trying to get us all motivated we're not good enough then we'll keep coming back to church and paying our time you know so if you ever get us to the place where we truly attain this whole christian thing we don't need you anymore and then you're out of a job and praise god that's what i want to do is preach myself out of a job man let's go church [Applause] but is it a carrot on a stick wait so what you're telling me if you think it's a carrot on the stick what you're telling me like is your god so small that you think like that someone can just dangle just a little bit more out there and just a little bit more out there is just a little bit more out there is your god so amazing that it's obvious to you that he can never fully be attained because your god is so big and your god is so great your god is so wonderful he's righteous he's holy he's just why do you want to go to the millennium you ever think about that what do you want a millennium i mean other than cheesecake and unsweet arnold palmer i know that's probably just just absolute blasphemy down here but but you know cheesecake and unsweet arnold palmer sounds real good in the millennium to me you know what is that what we want in the millennium oh yeah and no covered no masks you know no sickness no death that's all sounding real good this is so let me let me ask you this if i could create a place right now we could all get on a bus and go go to it and i could create a place that and it's wonderful there's no tears there's no sickness dying covered masks and and and you know and and mascaras you know people yelling at you and all that you know lovely people going to be there and you got all the rest you want all the cheesecake you want and what's your favorite food bob cheesecake so praise god we're going to have fellowship and nice uh i don't know it's we're a little bit farther down south maybe we need 80 degree days or something 75 80 degrees somewhere in there pretty good for you guys we'll just keep it that how many want to go we got a bus we're going home we want to go everyone okay great we'll well we'll set it up we'll just all we'll just all go and we'll leave with this old past house and just one small caveat i just feel like i probably better tell you jesus won't be there but it'll everything else will be great but jesus won't be there how many want to go just one person at least she's honest do we have to up the ante i mean what is it what's what's missing everything that's everything that you want that that's great can be there just know jesus like but you still don't want to go what are you what are you talking about oh so then then we recognize that everything truly like the reason you want to go if you think about it for a moment the reason you want to go to the millennium is because everything that is good that will be there everything that's lovely everything that's fun that's enjoyable that's righteous and just and and healthy why is it there because the character of god put it there it's the character of christ that's expressed in an age in a land in a time that will we will be everything that christ is is exactly what you want yeah i think he's worth pressing into because that's what i won he said brother trevor cheesecake is in jesus christ absolutely absolutely because he created it everything that's good everything that's lovely virtuous righteous and just is found in jesus christ is he not worth pressing into man yeah i think he is i think because i think if you're truly honest with yourself and like we just went through this little exercise you're saying that you won't go to a millennium without him well then why would you seek after anything but him here if that's what you're seeking after and what you want to go into there why wouldn't you be doing it now because he died on the cross he bridged the gap and you can get back into fellowship with him every day for the believer ought to have just a little piece of the millennium now now don't misunderstand me and think that i think we're in the millennium now because goodness no i'm not there all right but i'm saying you should have such a relationship with jesus christ you there's so much more of him to get than the average church-going believer ever attains to and god is telling us hey it's almost time to go why do you sit here half asleep when there's so much that you can have [Applause] and well we say well you know we we love that quote we're living we're living a million miles below our privileges amen we all know it we all kind of hang our heads it's like you know but yet we have hope because it's like well we have more privileges than we have right now i just wish we could get into it you know and and zach when you you know when you wanted the privilege of driving the car what was the what was that one word that that your father would be like yeah i just don't know if you have enough yet responsibility did you have to hear that in the back from them whispering or did you anyway we're living a million miles below our privileges young people you wanted a dog at your house you wanted a cat you wanted a pet a bird a fish a lizard i don't know what these days it's kind of crazy maybe a little pig and your parents said i don't know because i don't want to feed it oh i'll feed it i'll take care of it yeah i'm just not sure that you're ready for the responsibility that that privilege entails so if we're living a million miles below our privileges zach what are we living also a million miles below responsibility yes responsibility we're living a million miles below our responsibility sometimes why because we stopped pressing the reason we stopped pressing is not because we're bad people it's not because we don't love jesus but we allowed the mark to come down to a low point where we said well i attained it and i'm good but paul said i count not myself to have apprehended well glory to god so we we begin to lift the mark up we begin to lift the mark up and that produces action in us that produces that produces a calling in us that produces a oh there is more that's great there's something for me to do you know how you know how zack feels when i tell him you know what god wants to use you god needs you god needs you in those johnston murphys man to go yeah you know how he feels if he's right with the lord and you know if he doesn't have to be like oh i cannot go do some repenting you know which do you know how it feels when he's told god needs you god wants to use you and your gifting and your calling to to to take this world for him to show and and maybe you'll think you you aren't even being effective but he still wants to use you do you know how zack feels zach stands a little straighter his shoulders round back just a little bit he's like yes lord ah once there's me i'm desired i'm needed right i'm called and it's personal yeah that feels good i like that i'm needed for something i'm not worthless and it's not just theology it's not just no yeah you're not worthless jesus died for you and you go yay jesus died for me yeah but he also poured himself out as the holy spirit and to live inside of you to to work inside of you when he needs you and you go oh hey hey hey this just got cool man and so you stand up a little straighter you begin to have joy because you start hitting the mark maybe it was just 20 yards for a while but then you got to 30 then you got to 40 then you got to 50 then you started winning awards and man because i'm hitting the mark every time and then and i'm taking the responsibility and i'm pressing in i'm learning how to hit that mark and i'm studying my bible and i'm down on my knees in prayer and i'm hitting that mark because i've set that mark high and and it's getting greater every single time all the all the time and man i felt good you know 20 years ago and well i guess the lord maybe called me to be a preacher and i lead some bible studies or something like that we had some amazing times and let me tell you what i am really enjoying traveling and preaching it feels good man i love serving the lord absolutely it feels great i told my son one time i said you know what i said um because we were talking about you know it's it's difficult sometimes you know i i i got a full-time job i'm a web developer you know that's a field that changes all the time you got to kind of study and learn some things and try to keep up with things and how this all works or you're going to get behind and you know so you got to kind of do this and then but yet here i'm a minister too and i got to study the word and i got to learn all of this kind of thing and you know you gotta divide your time sometimes and i said i said you know what but i didn't i didn't become you know i said guess why i travel to norway and preach well it's not because i'm just so break them or other like no it no because i've i've studied i've put in the time i've practiced i've spoken before people little by little pressing in pressing in pressing in why why am i doing that not because i'm something great no it's because god put a gift in my life and pretty much can't do anything but but you know but at the same time and there's times when man i mean you know it's like look this is the great part like evangelists we live the good life you know pastors god bless you brother burden bearer you know got the whole world on his shoulders i was telling my son the other day i said you know what as a minister i said sometimes you know when you're doing more of the pastor type stuff and not just traveling the world preaching but you know getting down and having to actually help people and deal with people and not just stir up the church and then light it on fire and leave you know like people begin to tell you absolutely terrible things that you can tell no one that ain't easy man that's not easy at all we hear things that are just wait what no no that didn't happen no that oh my goodness oh goodness jesus help me because i i don't even know how to handle hearing about that let alone these people just went through that so it's hard but yet as you grow you recognize there's things that are hard there's also things that are just amazing then when you're sitting there and you're making breakthroughs and you're helping someone under christ and you're like god you did this you did this i mean you needed me to put in the time you needed me to put in the work it doesn't just happen but i put in the work and suddenly you know people from you know around the world actually want to hear me speak that's just weird i mean truly you know the little guy inside of me that's like you know kind of insecure trevor you know he's like what never thought that would have happened you know hey why because the mark is high right it didn't stop we didn't stop we keep pressing because it's high and so while there's burdens there's also great great great blessings you know because somebody's going to come up to me after service and say i absolutely needed that brother trevor i've been down and i've been to you know and man i've been you know and then two years later like brother trevor like you remember you pressed the mark i'm like you remember me preaching you remember the title like my jesus that must have made an impact you remembered something from two years ago that's crazy man and you know how you feel it feels good and i love it i love it i don't take the glory but i'm just like no but that's okay i love it thank you that's very encouraging i appreciate that i'm glad the lord used me to help you there's great joy in that and the privileges have raised as i've put the responsibility in and god wants the same for you he doesn't want you to just sit there and go well i'm a message believer now yay there's more there's more than it but brother trevor i'm not a preacher like nobody's going to call me from around the world to have me preach that's fine god has asked you to do something right we'll talk about that here in a little bit if we don't get till noon so so the problem is is what we what we end up doing is when we when we begin to feel like we arrived and you know sometimes there's an absolute progression you know you you know maybe somebody comes into the message and and they just begin to go wow this is so amazing there's so much revelation there's seals there's churches ages and and thunders and all of these things and i get to understand and you study and you know it's great and then you get to this you know kind of peak to where at some point in time you you generally understand the seals and you generally understand the church ages and the trumpets and these things and you you know yeah brother madam said this and this and you know i get the i get the general picture i kind of understand i never did before but i do now and it's great i love it you know and that's you know and so then you kind of you know plateau yeah and you know because well some of that newness is worn off some of that super revelation that you feel like you never had has kind of well i actually got that revelation now and so so you know you went from this stage and of of newness and the problem is some people can't they can't live without that feeling and so they got to come up with crazy doctrines so that they can still be super revelated because they just enjoyed that feeling so much so you can watch out for that but then some people just kind of plain out and it's like well i get it now like i'm basically arrived in message understanding and so what do i do now well now that god has given you the tools that you need why don't you do something with them that's that's what it is but the problem is is that we begin amen problem is that we begin to look around and we begin to see what the message culture around us is doing and and because you know well maybe i don't really want to keep pressing because maybe that responsibility doesn't sound so great and i don't really want to do that and i don't i'm not truly convinced that when i put in all this effort that there's really going to be that much joy coming back so i'm just going to kind of sit here and i'm going to look but i still feel like i need to do something you know because i need to feel good for christ and so what we begin to do is say well me and my message culture and this little church and the few churches that we agree with you know we we kind of all get it but you know there's some people that understand things differently than we do and so so you know what we're going to do is we're going to have to we're going to have to do something about them because because that's way more convenient than doing something about you i mean you know what i'm learning yeah people don't want character character is a victory not a gift you're gonna have to go through a little suffering negate character people do not want it they want jesus like look lord i'm praying you just come fix this because i don't want to have to go through this situation and have character on the other end of it you just fix it supernaturally lord because i ain't going through that and see the process of character development the process of you pressing on into christ it's it's not always easy it's not always fun and so it would be so much easier if we can recognize that i've attained but i see those other people over there they haven't attained and if jesus is going to use me he's going to use me to help get them in because their message is e-ness isn't messaging-ness enough we are we are writer message than they are and so we we we must be used by god and so you know we took we i preached this sermon and this was a perfect story because this literally happened just before we preached this before i preached the sermon it's like i love it when god gives me a story on saturday to use in the sermon on sunday that's great and so we we we were um we were in south carolina we were at this brother's house he lives out in the country he's got this i think it's a blue heather it's a sheep dog kind of a kind of a dog and they're all laughing and everything and they're like oh i bet you he's gonna get brother trevor today and i was like what are you talking about it's like well that dog you know he's a sheepdog what does sheepdog do they nip they nip at the heels to keep the sheep together that's what their instinct is it's what they're trained to do and so apparently this dog though he's just you know they said you know he can be just out in the yard he can be 100 yards away and you think man there's no way and you you you go up the steps and you turn to walk in the door and that dog will come out of nowhere and get you in the heel before you get in the door and i was like i don't know what we're going to do here because it would be it would be a shame to have to kill a killer brother's dog before you preach to him the day before you know the next day like this i just don't know how that would work but if that dog nips me he's that will be his last nip like i'm i better not feel it so then they're like well we should go on a walk it's a beautiful day let's go on a walk down the country road okay let's go on a walk that sounds nice the dog came right like what are you doing like is there a chain like with you know the dog wasn't leashed you know we're in the country it just no and so you know we're like what are we gonna do this dog is you know i mean and guess what the dog is doing he's like what's he's looking for you know i said look sweetie kids stay in the middle is that dog's looking for outliers he is trained to keep people in a group so don't get out of the group and we won't get nipped by this dog and all will be well and and even though we were in the group but we're still watching this we're walking down the road yeah i'm watching you the most uncomfortable walk down the country road i have ever had in my entire life but i realized something we're message sheepdogs sometimes we're message sheepdogs we're like no yo you're not in the right here you gotta you gotta you know we nippy nippy nip try to get you over in our church or nippy nippy nip try to get you over into our understanding and you know we want other message people to be in our message understanding and rightness and things like that and you know none of us can actually think well praise god you know hey maybe i'm the one that's wrong we don't do that well you know what i tell tell brothers usually as brothers that you know when we're disagreeing i say well there's one of three possibilities here and i always start with this one because then you know they always agree with it first it's always nice to start with something somebody can agree with and i say look we have one of three possibilities i'm wrong you're wrong we're both wrong like it's just logic it's okay yeah maybe i'm wrong maybe i'm trying to get people this is gonna lose something there we go maybe i'm trying to get people and i'm trying to be a message sheepdog but i'm wrong man that's a problem that's not what god is asking us to do right it's like oh you feel like you obtained go get other people and get the same level of your attainment no the problem isn't the problem the problem isn't whether you've attained or not the problem is you set the mark low and so you're like well now that i'm here i gotta i have nothing else to do so i'm gonna go meddle in other people's lives and try to get them into the same low mark that i got to no no why don't we set the mark a lot higher why don't we set the mark a lot harder here let me read you this quote because i love this quote this is great it's just great because it makes no sense like it does but it at first when you when you read it i'm like no this isn't it can't be this way brother bram says in the sudden secret go into the way of the church it's not up to the branham tabernacle neither it is up to any other church it's up to you as an individual to be ready at the coming of the lord you must be ready i must be ready i'll sweep my own steps it's up to you to sweep your steps leave mine alone me leave yours alone you've got to make your garment ready you say brother trevor why doesn't that make sense well does does that yeah yeah go to the next one there yeah how about that attitude i'll sweep my own steps it's up to you to sweep your own steps leave mine alone i'll leave yours alone mind your own business no get out of my business i'll get out like that's christian right i mean that's what we do as christians we stay out of each other's business and you know we just say look get your steps ready because i'm over here getting rid of taking care of mine and that doesn't sound caring that doesn't sound loving that doesn't sound like how does that work because the problem is is you set the mark low and you begin to meddle over there and and and your steps ain't clean because the mark that you set was so low that it doesn't matter whether your steps were clean or not so let's talk about sweeping your steps what happens when you begin to sweep your steps and if we're concerned about others what we really ought to do is start working on me because here's what happens you know you start sweeping your steps you know you get out and you're like well man the steps are dirty maybe i should clean them and you start sweeping your steps and it's dangerous to start sweeping your steps we'll talk about why that is later but you start sweeping your steps and you know maybe you get the dvds out of the door you get the cds you shouldn't have mp3s sorry let me update it to 2021 and you get you know or maybe you get the rights you know playlists on spotify here we go now we're in 2021 and and or pandora whichever i don't know am i missing any okay we continue on and you start sweeping the things you know in just down the outside in your life you know maybe you get rid of sorry i said dvds forgive me maybe you get rid of your netflix account you know or you know or you get a filter for your disney plus i don't know yeah or you know maybe everybody got that step clean already good i love that so great or not okay so you start sweeping the steps and there's things that you just shouldn't have you know and maybe you know maybe you get rid of the scissors and maybe you get rid of the you know the tight this and the tight that and you know you get the yeah them little skin down wiener skirts out sweeping the steps sweeping the steps sweeping the step man we meddling today okay sweep the steps and you get that first step clean and you go my that looks like a nice step well there's probably three or four more don't stop there but i got all the like the stuff like man the stuff that you evangelists come and preach about and tell us to get rid of like netflix like you know i got rid of it okay what do you want me to do i did the thing i'm good now right because i've conformed to what you said i should be doing to be a good message believer i have attained the mark no once you step look the mud comes the mud comes from the ground up like the outside that first step you know that's just the physical manifestation of the dirt so why don't we step down into your heart just a little bit and start thinking about why was it that the preacher even had to tell me i should get rid of some of this stuff well maybe it's because the condition of my heart isn't right maybe it's because i desire some of those things and i gotta really get down and man that second step it's a doozy like that's that that's a real sometimes you know the stringer isn't right and that last step is a real big one you know so you really fall down that one and you get there and you're like wow this is crazy and i'm sweeping this step and i'm actually getting my heart right and people don't like to do that because that's well it's hard that's right it don't feel good it's not fun well till it's over and then you go man i cannot believe and how many how many would testify and say you know there's things that god has brought me out of that five years ago i thought i'd never get out of that but now you're out of that and you look at it back there and five years ago and you go what on earth i cannot believe i ever struggled with that how did i ever think that was okay come on somebody so then what are the things that you're dealing with today that the preachers are like yeah you should get rid of this and you're like man but i don't know like i like that thing think about that thing that you got rid of five years ago that you're thinking that was stupid how could i ever do it maybe that'll help you because there's probably more of that and then five years from now you'll be like well he was right i'm so glad i got rid of that like i bet everybody thought i was heathen well we knew that there was grace because we were heathens too all right praise god we love each other okay so you get down on that next step you start sweeping and then man this guess what there's two more steps and you keep dropping down and getting down closer to the heart closer to that's when it really gets easy i mean not easy but really really hard because guess what there's more dirt down there because you're you know you're closer to the dirt the ground and that's when you know somebody steps right there gets all the mud the first step gets most of it second step gets a little bit less third step four step right so it's easier to clip the clean the top steps and then as you get down into the heart it's harder to get those steps clean and you know maybe you got to get a little shovel flat flat scrape that just a little bit and then get it nice and clean and you finally get your clean steps you know instead of worrying about you know your other your neighbor's steps you just actually start worrying about your steps and you think well that's isn't that selfish no because because here's the hard part here's what's going to happen next somebody's going to see your steps and you'll be like but i just cleaned them isn't that a good thing well maybe it depends on who it is it's all your steps because they're going to have one of two reactions the first reaction is who do you think you are you think your steps are cleaner than mine and you're like i just i took a broom and i swept my steps this was this had nothing to do with you or they look at your steps and go look at your steps look at my steps and you're like okay how's this gonna go and they go my steps are dirty because i see your steps and when i look at your steps i recognize my like i want steps like yours how'd you do that you say well i took a broom and i began to sweep amen you see when you begin to sweep your steps and you begin to really live your life others are going to notice it's going to make a reaction in others you want to help others sweep your steps you want to impact this world sweep your steps start here and then when you start here maybe that's going to impact others by just they're going to observe it they're going to see hey you set an example of clean steps and i recognize i got a little bit of work to do so i don't have to go next door to brother louise look at them steps man whoo you know you got somebody to shine my shoes after i walk into your house goodness sakes brother why don't you get with the program and become a message believer come on now somebody you don't message like i do why don't you clean your steps why don't you set the mark high and start pressing and people are either gonna love your hate you're one of the two but man you're gonna have an impact on this world so you think me sweeping my steps and me leaving your steps alone like yeah that's actually helping others that's not being that's not being selfish it's not being well well he's got a bad attitude he won't help anybody else with their steps yes he will by exposing and not for the purpose of exposing but just because my steps ought to be clean because that's pleasing to christ so god begins to use you just as you begin to to serve him and to grow in him and to be what he's calling you to be because it's a high calling that paul hadn't even apprehended and you begin to to attain and apprehend people begin to be inspired and go my goodness look look what this guy's doing look what this girl's doing that's something i ought to attain to and it makes an impact on the world so when zach cleans his steps everybody else is like yeah i might not wear johnston murphy's he might not either i'm not sure but i want to be like zach because his steps are so clean so you know another problem that we have though is is is and and 11 30 i might even try to clean no probably not but anyway i'll try to close here in 15 20 minutes all right so but but another problem that we have here is is is is we tend to group so much but god isn't calling a group to press the mark he's calling zack to press the mark he's calling bob depressed he's calling esther to press the mark he's calling you he's calling you to press the mark not this church not a group he's calling you as an individual to sweep your steps to press to the mark of the high calling that high calling for you the problem is is that we we well let me hear there's a quote there's a quote we should read that quote first where's that one is your life worthy of the gospel brother branham says a christian is not a tool or some kind of a mechanical wrench to a great big religious regime that's right a christian he he's not a tool that keeps a religious organization moving a christian that's not a christian a christians to be christ-like and a christian cannot be a christian until christ comes into that man that life of christ in him then it produces the life that christ did and you do the things that christ did you're not a tool right you didn't come into this church and just like you're look you know what if zach is a wrench and we lose zach we just get new wrench no big deal they make you know what they make wrench they they stamp them it's the same thing a wrench is a wrench is a wrench is a wrench you aren't the tool zach you're not a wrench man he's unique you're unique god wants to use you in your uniqueness so so so when when you know because otherwise what we do um we invite people to the mwti anybody ever went there mwti message witnessing um training institute you didn't know you all didn't go there well that's where you learn how to tell people how brother brandon was a prophet how else are you going to witness if you haven't learned at the mwti yeah you see you need to send all your young people to the mwti brother do you know who you know who teaches at the mwti that'd be me and guess what i got a great way for you look if you don't know how to how to tell people why we believe brother brown is a prophet straight out of the bible like look come to the mwti i'll tell you how to show people guess which way i'll tell you the way i do it why will i tell you the way i do it because i think it's best it might be but it's maybe that's the way it's best for me but i don't know if maybe it's not the way you should do it maybe there's a different way maybe there's maybe god is just calling you to live in a way now i'm not like look just just a little caveat here like we we we listen to the brother brandon talk about god's billboards and and and sometimes we think what our witnessing is is when our sisters go to the grocery store like that's a problem church that's just kind of a problem it's like well i witnessed because i wear my skirt to the grocery store okay good like but like there's probably more yeah that god is calling you to do there's probably mine like so let's let's not just take that cheap way out like go and be god's billboard at the grocery store but god probably wants more don't worry that's a good thing it'll be great so if you all come to the mwti and you learn from me here's how you witness people here's how you get them in a message here's the scriptures used and here's you know you use this one first and then this one and then you ask them this question and then you do this and then you say this and then you show them this and you go through you know all the way to revelations 3 14 and 7th messenger and then you say well now flip over to revelations 10 and it's just like in the days of the voice of the seventh angels he wants first one second one's third like it's cool like that works like people get it and everybody just does that you know and then and zach learns it and esther learns it and rachel learns it we begin to see the same people at the grocery store and people begin to be like oh there's another one yeah i get it seventh angel right yeah i guess i've seen you well you've never met me before yeah i know but one of your carbon copy was here last week because if we all become the same then we're just some tool and we're replaceable god doesn't do that you're not just a tool you're not replaceable because god god made you the way he made you so so doesn't it doesn't that doesn't that bring some joy too doesn't that doesn't that bring some like yeah god wants me and he's not just saying me because like i'm a christian and i'm sitting here so who else is gonna no he wants you as an individual he loves you he desires you he gifted you he put something in your life that we need cause we need one another maybe you're an encourager maybe you're a prayer maybe you're a witness or maybe you're maybe you're an evangelist or you're a teacher you're this you're that i don't know what it is maybe you pray for your husband as you do laundry well praise god pray over that laundry whatever it is that god has called you and gifted you into doing it's important and he uniquely qualified you to do it in your specific way let's look at this other quote brother i'm talking about you know how they put the stones together in the in the temple you know and he said he said identify masterpiece of god we're always going to be that way god is not a sears and robot harmony house he's a god of variety he makes one way one one way and one another but we must serve him in the way that god made us and be glad and stay behind the word that's the way god did it and he starts to talk about out of return in jubilee he starts to talk about how they made the temple and how they cut the stones outside the temple and then brought them in and fit the stones together and sometimes you know they began to do the tetris of all the stones and then there was a you know there was like one of the stones was a little late coming so they've got all this fit together and it's like well here's this odd shape here like we got something that's got to fit that or we won't be complete and maybe these guys out here they're cutting a stone and they're like looking at this stone going that is the weirdest looking stone i've ever cut like look at how many directions that turns and moves and goes up and down it's got these little notches in it and things like that that's the weirdest looking stone ever and then but then that stone comes and it fits just right in that slot brother brahm says i think god down through this time has cut out some very odd stones that we might not have understood but they have their place exactly in the temple and the building of god you've got your place and only you are going to fit that place so what are we saying saying that the mark is high that the mark requires you to press and you will press if you wreck if you set the mark higher than just a church you know mwti tool well you set that mark a little higher you recognize i've got god wants me to be good at something god has a purpose for me god has a plan for me you stand up a little straighter you square your shoulders back and you recognize that god not only does he love me not only does he die for me because he died for everybody but no we're talking about me here this sudden became personal that god loves me that god wants to use me that god gifted and called me and you begin to stand and you begin to have purpose and then when you begin to have purpose you walk through the church doors it's like i am here and people start thinking like this brother's got a pride complex no this brother feel good let's worship god here church that's what we came to do and i'm part of that plan i'm a stone in that that wall i'm part of the foundation i'm one of the pillars i help hold this thing up let's do this church yeah that feels good that's the way you come into church not well here we go got my coffee at racetrack get me hopefully i can i got a double this morning though cause my goodness heard brother wade was preaching yeah wait i said i wasn't gonna pick on him i'm going to hear that one later and we walk into church because we have no purpose because we don't have the mark high enough we walk into the grocery store and we're like well yeah i don't know i'm a christian but because we have no purpose because we haven't set the mark high enough the problem is not with your pressing hard enough the problem is not with your your you just need to be better you just need to do harder come on church let's go why don't you actually give god some you know work it up in the motion and let's get to it and let's just dig down a little deeper he's coming soon so now it's the gun lap let's press all night now we put the after burners on and you say brother trevor okay that's great but monday i forgot because i didn't feel that i mean maybe i did for the five minutes we worshipped after service but then i got over and i started thinking about the basketball game and i forgot all about it and it don't work and after we do that about 30 times over five years we start losing the steam felt good while we were in the presence but then we left why because you didn't set the mark higher you got enthused and you got excited and that was wonderful and we need those times but man you got to recognize who you are that's what brother man said teaching is forward teaching puts you in the right place shows you who you are and where you are and you know where you fit so that you can actually do something in this world yeah god wants you to set the market yeah to give everything amen that you have but i'm god's not asking you i'm not asking you to give everything you have for the sake of giving everything you have because that's what's right do it because that's what god says figure it out do better try harder no no step back for a moment get down in prayer and recognize he's worth everything when you can begin to look at him and meditate on him you know we don't meditate anymore just like we were talking you know god doesn't change and and we think we don't meditate anymore because man meditating is like sitting there you know i'm not talking about oriental meditation i'm just talking about meditating on scripture meditating on who jesus christ is stopping for a moment considering slowing down the devil wants to speed things up and he wants to change things like crazy keep you moving keep you moving like whoa i haven't looked at my phone in two minutes i bet somebody has posted something and i bet it's super important i need to spend time with god if i spend time with god i begin to recognize that mark that's way up there and i want it and then a preacher doesn't have to come in here and tell you to press because there's something inside of you going so be awesome be awesome for him he wants you he desires you not i'm not saying what's the name of this church spoken word church i didn't say he want spoken word church he said he wants you sweep your steps prepare yourself begin to find that mark that that's him and press towards him if you truly find it you won't have to try to press how can you fail the press to the compelling awesomeness that he is that's who he is that's who he is you know i had a time in my life where um you know i was a good church kid you know i grew up in this message and such from time i was about eight when i started going to these youth camps you know down in alabama while i was in alabama i heard brother brother ron spencer he started reading quotes like out of stature of a perfect man a body has thou prepared me a body that god can dwell in god can walk in god can see in god can talk in god can work in amen living instrumentality of god god walking on two feet in you god just might be wearing johnston murphy's this morning or clarks i don't know but you look down at your feet and you say there's god walking in those feet you know i had this job and it was a terrible job but you know i'd go to the break room and and this quote would be ringing in my ears be like well god walk into the break room go eat a sandwich god's sitting in the break room eating a sandwich god walking back to my desk who does the brother think he is a son of god that's who i think i am that's who i know i am this quote man it started to beginning to ring in my ears i'm like man god wants to walk in my feet mine that's crazy talk why would he do that cause he desires me i don't know why he does but he does and i'm so glad he does he begins to read them we know this quote until the last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age i started warming up my voice remy fosso latito let's warm this puppy up god wants to use my voice are you kidding me right now i'm 18 19 years old sitting there in this youth camp going i never heard something like this wait a second like i heard what i was supposed to do i heard the doctrines i heard how this was all going to work out and how the coming of the lord and the how many years and this all these things and that's great i love those things man i can geek out on those things you know theological geeks that's okay you know anyway i lo look i love that just as much as the next guy but wasn't when i was 19 i didn't even be told god wanted to use me god had a purpose for me it wasn't just about dates and times and theology but there was a reality that this message was that could come on the inside and not just seal me to take me to heaven but to put me in action into service that there was something that god wanted for me and i loved that man i said all right i get it now i know why i'm learning this now because because it tells me who god is and so many wonderful things and then i'm going to use that for him great man oh man i loved it these last days the true bride church comes to the headstone she'll be the super church of super race as she nears a great headstone man that's cool they will be so much like so much like him they will be even in his very image me i'm from minnesota yeah i started working at that airport people be like you don't you're not from here are you yeah no sir i'm up there around minneapolis yeah sit a little colder up there yeah he wants to use my voice that's weird but he does but he does so when a spirit born you know this one you could all just quote it with me spirit-filled man takes that word into his heart places it upon his lips [Music] [Applause] you know what i said sign me up god see the mark got set higher right when that mark got set higher and i caught a vision that there was more than just me understanding stuff and that was message but that there was a purpose in all of it i mean i didn't have a problem just sitting there and doing the thing the problem is is when we sit there doing the thing and we get a little bored well then we start getting a little lax and we let things we shouldn't into our lives but when we really catch a vision that god wants me and he wants to use me man it makes you stand up straight makes you go yay i'm so glad to be a part of this i'm filled with joy and purpose and all right here we go let's do this nobody had to tell me to press anymore that's right i did it because i caught that vision i trust you will too from beyond the curtain of time musicians you can come i love this because it's just so poetic and beautiful each one of us play a part in this picture and in this song we are parts of the kingdom of god and that is we can play our parts as long as we realize where we are positionally belong in this place and then stay right there in that place and one place we know it's in love because that's what makes up the picture you have your place you have your part in this song and in this picture romans 13 11 and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than what we believed and when we believed it's time church it's time to see where the mark is if you've been asleep meditate on god get that mark a little higher that'll set you up good shall we pray heavenly father but we love you so much you're so you're so good to us lord we want to serve you from the depths of our heart lord we're sitting in this church because we love you because we've been trained we've been taught we've been uh we've been convinced of the realities of a god but father sometimes we we've we've drift off to sleep a little bit sometimes we we think we've arrived and we don't recognize how great and wonderful and lord we just our eyes maybe get filmed over i don't know what it is lord i'm not going to stand here make excuses lord all i want to say is lord i pray that you would catch a vision or put a vision in each one of our hearts that you want to use us that each one of us you've uniquely gifted and called and qualified and desired lord jesus to become something great what a privilege that is lord i just pray that in the heart of every believer here that's heard this this morning that there would be a cry that says god sign me up let me be a part of that let me have the vision the mark high let me hit the mark that i could become a good archer a good christian a solid son or daughter of the living god father what a calling you've given us we're so thankful we're so father we're just odd i'm a nobody god i look back and i see the testimony of how you brought me to this place father it's just grace father i i can't even process it if i try so all i'll say is thank you and i love you for it here am i send me lord okay lord can i can i be a part of doing that for someone else can i be a part of your grace to to call someone else out of out of who am i but thank you god like lord yes can we rescue everyone lord if that's what you want lord and that's what i want father show each of us with that give us each a glimpse of what that should be should be for our lives lord lord we love you and we praise you we thank you lord in jesus name we pray amen i guess we we probably know that song in jesus name we press on in jesus name i have no idea what key that would be in jesus name we press dear lord with the prize what's the prize jesus christ [Music] we find the strength [Music] jesus name we press on [Music] in jesus name we press on dear lord with the prize oh clear before our eyes we find the strength to press on one more time [Music]

looking forward to this afternoon before we come right back and get started right back again i love the services you know to work that you can just flow from one to the other and just keep right on going all on that but you make sure you tell our brother how much you appreciate him because we appreciate him coming appreciate his family coming and being with us we're glad for them to come and appreciate that they said we had a visitor back in the back so we do then we we just say to you welcome and you're always that away and then you come this afternoon you're not a visitor you're just part of us so that's the way we we always believe here and we keep it in that line okay all right let's just pray and be dismissed go eat a bite and come back this afternoon but make sure you tell her brother because he poured out his heart for us to be able to receive what we need to press on to press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling see i don't believe paul reached where brother branham did right that's right i don't you know i don't believe paul reached where brother random did because it's not in the scripture line but random was the major prophecy not if paul was so little now huh he didn't reach that you see but brother ronald kept pressing yeah he just kept pressing on he went through all of the years and then here it opened this way and opened that way he just kept pressing on so that's our part right amen father we thank you for the message that we've heard today and we we cherish it we believe it we thank you thank you for our brother to bring it unto us and lord reminding us of all of these things where we should be in this day in the hour that we're living because all the things are coming up on the earth but yet we are the bride of jesus christ and we are you lord and chose us to be here in the end time so now just make a uh a way to give our brother a rest to where that he can be rested and everything and then come forth this afternoon and speak the word of the lord unto us we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen you're dismissed amen [Music] heavenly father i appreciate [Music] heavenly father
