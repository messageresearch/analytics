protected us he guided us through this special eye and he blessed us to come here praise the name of the Lord the prophet of God said brother Branham said if you have the Holy Ghost whenever the church door is open I always mentioned this wherever I go if you have the Holy Ghost whenever the church door is open the Holy Ghost will bring you here not to any wrong place there are many wrong places in this world gambling den filmed you know film theater and you know and proceed to the homes and there are many men many more you know but thank God that proves we have the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost brought you and me here this morning time praise the name of the Lord and also I want to brings some things from the country of India to as a report and at the present situation is very bad the country of India we have now I'm not afraid to say the truth you know because it's on the YouTube or Internet you know I don't worry about that you know now I need your special prayers for the country of India now the Hitler's are ruling the country you know what is Hitler means Hitler killed so many millions of innocent Jews you know so Hitler's are ruling our country at present and their worship they believe in 33 millions gods and goddesses and they are trying to wipe out Christianity by 2020 122 you can read you can go in the internet and find out you know they are trying to wipe out Christianity in India by 2021 and 22 which is not possible anyhow so in one of the state our present Prime Minister he appointed his chief minister in India every state we have Chief Minister and governor and the chief minister at present in one of the state called Luther Pradesh and he's from a Hindu temple priest Hindu temple priest and as soon as he got the authority power you know he banned all the slaughtering houses it's a big state you'll find all kind of people there and ebuy he banned all the slaughtering houses no beef no pork no fish no chicken nothing and he want to convert that state there's a vegetarian state which is not possible so he's taking advantage of the power he got just yesterday I received the news you know I have a cell from food from India and I received the news the police there to protect the cow they knocked out the woman and woman is dead believe me to protect the cows C or W cow huh to protect the cow they're knocked out you know the woman and she's dead so that shows there is no value for the human being in the country of India and recently boyers had a special meetings in southern parts in one of the another state and their three brothers came from New Mexico I don't know them personally but they belong together Manuel Salazar's Church for New Mexico and they went to India and the boys had a meetings in one of the place and when the first meeting started the anti Christian organization came and stopped the meetings from 2000 years we have freedom to preach Christ we have freedom to preach the gospel but now they are tired trying to take away from all our rights I don't know what God is going to do about that I believe in God I remember about Phil 25 15 years back or maybe 20 years back I don't remember there was a president of Egypt I forgot his name and he stood one day and he said I am going to wipe out the name of Israel eyes from the map of the world and they they had a war with Israel and and he got defeated and he is dead so I believe the same thing God will do something I believe that praise the name of the Lord because we God had given us this commission to preach the gospel in India promote the message of the hour nobody can take it away no matter our blood drops goes you know they says you worship our God's or leave this country so I don't know but I believe God will do something praise the name of the law so remember there are a lot of Christians persecuted not only in India as well as all over the world so pray for the Christians and now the Christians Lord said if somebody slaps you on one cheek give turn another cheek of course we believe that you know but there are second majority in our country is Islamic people and they're not going to keep quiet you know we are going to retaliate and one day it will become it you know India will become a battleground those three brothers came and by the grace of the Lord they've they returned back safe to New Mexico and praise the name of the Lord for that but you know as far as the situation in the country of India now the white people you know the preachers preaching is not allowed openly you know and it is it is not safe for the white people to come to India but anyhow if you trust in the Lord you're welcome there's the Lord God takes care of you doctor you know God our God is a great God is Jehovah mighty God powerful God King of Kings Lord of lords Almighty is there to protect us praise the name of the Lord hallelujah okay if he says if if my time is come to go I'll go I'll die for Christ you know so praise the name of the lord so i bring special love and greetings from the orphans widows and the lepers because of your loving-kindness because of your prayers you love your burden they are still feeding 400 poor every day is a human being it's not possible but if a car God nothing is impossible he said poor I keep it for me so this is is responsible to feed the poor praise the name of the Lord and I have it adopted feed the poor and give them gospel and I thank God that that's success you know that is giving me success you know in how every here we baptized two hundred three hundred but you know it is going down because we have no freedom to baptize the people we have no freedom to back you know have a special meetings open-air or outside and whatever we do we had we need to do in the church and I don't know one day they will come in and that take over the church you know and that situation is very bad at present anyhow let the name of the Lord glorified so I believe special eleven greetings from the orphans old widows and the lepers and also the ministering brethren to are standing with us for this truth for this message praise the name of the LORD remember them in your special prayers they are poor but we do our best to help them we build a lot of houses to the preachers who are poor and also we build few churches and also we build some houses for the Labour caliber people you know and we are doing our best by His grace to help the poor praise the name of the Lord because I love the poor I believe that Scripture blessed is he who consider the poor where is the name of the Lord

times but don't like the they don't like the course oh my what is wrong the course is the Word of God it's not his words let God help especially the message people hallelujah praise the name of the Lord here in Malachi chapter 4 verse 2 says but unto you that fear my name write my name the name of Jesus Jesus Christ there are many Jesus's in the world but we need to believe in Jesus Christ raise the name of the Lord hallelujah but unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings is the Sun of righteousness as well as is Jehovah Rapha he heals his people he hears his people people pray for healing but they don't believe they don't have faith in God but the Word of God says he had already finished that healing on the cross of Calvary two thousand seventeen years back today by faith you have a cleric claim that healing in the name of Jesus Christ because we have the great name Jesus Christ no sickness could stand praise the name of the Lord hallelujah let us claim that healing let us believe in God let us first in God that I have faith in God without faith it's impossible to please God without faith praise the name of the Lord we

the discipling from an I had visited us from high praise the name of the Lord I like this Luke chapter 1 verse 78 in Romans chapter 13 verse 12 says the night is far spent the day is at hand let us

something here if I oh my yeah from this message in a farmer rainin letter then I missed it now watch its time when we see these things that Jesus said would take place look at him as I caught it last night there - look look at him if you look right it's dangerous so if if you look left it is danger if you look behind it's danger but we need to fix our eyes upon Jesus look at him watch him praise the name of the lion Lord Jesus Christ it's time when we see these things that Jesus said would take place look at him as I caught it last night as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man yes before the destruction of Sodom Abraham the church called out spiritual I might cut it again here they was standing out there to themselves living hard in those days also the true children of God they were living hard it that it was easy for them nothing was easy for them he can't live the life they youth day you did they lived it's hard oh boy Abraham was a great man

Shalom the prophet of God certain 64 it's seems like that gross darkness shall settled upon the people till they think the only thing there is to do is to go to church that's very easy job just go to church you know just write your name in the book of in the in the register you know under you know if something is born the pastor will come and help you take care of everything if something if somebody's dead you need to take care of that and that's what we need to do in India now if you are a blessed people you have a you know when a person died you know those people you on your incidence people they take to take him or her put it in there what you call that a funeral home we don't have you know looms and if somebody die we are in trouble you know we have to go and take care of everything and you believe me on many many deaths of our church and church people you know I'm telling this for the glory of God we have to pay for them because they are not in a position to you know pay for the Box pay for all the expenses thank God the funeral homes of course they charge you know I know that it's it's expensive ten thousand dollars or vital I don't know you know but in India we are in trouble the pastor's are in trouble hmm preachers are in trouble anyhow here it seems like that gross darkness are settled upon the people till they think the only thing there is to do is to go to church and be a pretty good person put your name on the book and little and some little mysterious thing God will teach pista key when you die and change that spirit in you to him you are mistaken the person you are mistaken when you die that spirit that's on you that the way you will forever be remember the prophets item four people left the religions people left the denomination churches they bought the spirit with them and that's what creating problem that same spirit the way you all forever be oh my and remember the Pharisees and Sadducees and so forth was very religious people at the time of Jesus Pharisees and Sadducees they were very religious people very religious people hmm but what happened they tried to kill Jesus they were harassing him for each and everything they were stoning him you know how they behaved with the oh my great job great creator of heaven and earth they're walking for them talking to them huh they couldn't realize that the creator of heaven and earth is walking talking to them they couldn't understand because they were blind and that's what happened to the Christians nowadays you know we are worshiping the Living God we are worshiping the creator of heaven and earth they're worshiping the God who was who is and his coming his Almighty is powerful he can do anything for you if you believe he can do anything for you I accepted Christ when I was

protect you from that God you know thank God for His grace and mercy glory the message called the X the N exposition of the seven Church ages seven ages chapter four the spiri and business spear me in' church age this is wonderful mein Adam took life and turned it into death mein Adam took life and turned it into death but this man Jesus took death and turned it into life Jesus Christ can give you life precious brothers in justice there's no life anywhere in any faith any religion but Jesus Christ can give you life praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hmm oh my Adam took innocence and turned it into guilt this one took guilt and turned it into righteousness when you accept Christ you become a righteous man what his blood God is we are under the blood now you know that we are under the blood of Jesus Christ praise the name of the Lord Adam took a paradise and turned it into West Halling wilderness but this one is coming back to turn an earth rocking and reeling the destruction into another Eden thank God Adam took a life of fellowship and joy with God and turned it into desert of spiritual darkness and a broad forth all sin eScience in his dangerous brother/sister sin is dangerous oh my hmm hallelujah praise the name of the Lord moral decay pain suffering delusion in corruption that was within the souls of men that is because of Eve hmm and Adam part took her sin but this one from all the tragic death the gradation that filled mankind brought for the life of righteousness and beauty that is Jesus Christ so that a scene once reigned unto death even so might men now reign in righteousness by one Christ Jesus not as the offence was though terrible indeed it was but now much more is his gift and to eternal life thank God Jesus Christ has given as I turn on like praise the name of the Lord the young Richard ruler came running there was some good qualities in him you know young Richard ulla first thing you know people stay next door but they don't want to come to church but this man coming running he came running to Jesus Christ he came running number two he kneeled down in front of Jesus I'm closing it now he came and kneeled down it's very hard sometimes to deal down you know but two great people of God in the Old Testament they were kneeling down and looking unto God calling upon the name of the Lord so that's young Mary agree Senora Rula he was kneeling down he humbled himself humbleness is very important we need to become humble we need patience Christians in these last days we need patience we need to humbleness we need to obeyed obedience will be the Word of God praise the name of the Lord hallelujah and another thing he was a hunger to know the truth the young rich ruler I am talking about he was he was hunger to know the truth he respected Jesus but only problem was in him was wealth too much wealth too much rich and the Word of God says but I wonder sometimes you know Abraham was rich ah job was a rich man which is man there is nothing wrong with the riches the love of money is the root of hidden our God is rich he wants us to be rich people but we need to give first place to Jesus first place to God then you will be
