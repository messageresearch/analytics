praise God he put one inside of us the Glad day that we were born again he put a river he told that lady at the at the well he said you drink of this water he said you'll never thirst he said this water you'll never run dry she said sir give me of that water and guess what he did he gave it to her so all we got to do is ask and he'll give it to us amen good to be back in the house the Lord good and see each and every one of you with us just make these announcements real quick and we'll get started we got communion today and foot washing so just keep that and you prayer brother Louise will be speaking for us Wednesday night um the coming 18th that will be a couple of Saturdays from now that'll be the youth service brother Jack Duff will be with us at three o'clock and then we'll have a meal afterwards probably pizza or something like that we'll work on that when June gets back we'll have one service on the 19th that would be Sunday at normal regular time regular service all right just remember that also remember March the 24th we'll some of us are going to the wedding over in Beaufort that'll be Friday and Saturday but we'll be back on the 25th brother Samuel Reyes will be speaking for us on the 26th spoke to him this morning uh going through a little rough time left rough spot but you know what God's proud of him God allowed that to happen so his character same way with me and you he allows these things to happen so our character can be made manifest and we can see what if we didn't know what to work on he gives us that for us to realize what we need to work on what our strengths are what our weaknesses are to me that's his plan he planned to do that because he knew we'd need it and so we need to just take that plan and use it and looking forward Brother Scott will be here on East on Good Friday that'll be a seven o'clock service April the 8th will be a Saturday service we'll probably have a fellowship meeting I'm gonna call Brother Homer we had the same thing last year but that same time I'll call Brother Homer and see if they want to do that and then on then that'll be the eighth brother Chris long on the ninth he'll be here also with us one service so just keep that in your prayer then we got other stuff coming but we'll be announcing that later on uh we sure miss everybody that's not here we uh we're praying for them sister Smallwood different ones Lord it just they just don't ever miss you know the they're here even when they're sick and we sure miss them and if they're not here they're sick yeah they can't say that to all of us but when if they're sick and they're not here but it's a fight you have to fight your way you have to fight your way here and you bite your way back get it right since we're back I heard you say there she said it is it's a fight it's a struggle but you know what I'd rather do that and gain eternal life than to lose my soul and go to hell all right gain the whole world but Lose My Soul brother Louise you know it's 10 000 worlds that to me that's an awesome statement when it took a profit to be able to go back in the mind of God to even know there was ten thousand worlds but your soul is worth ten thousand worlds ten thousand of these all we think it's great because of of bezo and Amazon and uh and all those people like that if they're not born again they'll just vaporize into nothing their money their bank account their hunt I saw where somebody the other day with Bill Gates and over a hundred billion dollars now he was worth I can't fathom that I could spend it but I couldn't fathom that but it without God you got way more than he does way more ten thousand worlds worth than he does but the people like that that put on this world to prove one thing's for sure God's in control this whole thing and if you don't if you don't uh do what God says then it doesn't matter if you're rich because even even Jesus he loved that rich guy he loved that rich that rich Rich Young Ruler he loved him he said man come on Rich Young Ruler couldn't give him and then Jesus turned around and said it's really hard for a for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven because he'll always fall to his riches first and depend on that when you depend on God if you depend on God with zero dollars I'd rather do that and depend on myself with 10 billion dollars all right everybody with me on that that's what we got to look at we got to see that God is God's in control he's the one that's doing it and we're just gonna have to let go and let God all right so let's bow our heads I know we all have um things on our heart that we need to uh pray about and we appreciate each and every one of you being here and we love you with the love of the Lord thank you for all the support that you've given us and the support that you give the church and the cleaning of the church and getting everything keeping everything up and and we're working on a few other things to do and uh we just want to be uh ever in the will of God not in the will of ourself so let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this day that you give us Lord we now know that you are in control as the song says you've got it all in control and I pray Lord that you'd be with us in the furthermore this service you take control you speak to the people you go down there aisle Lord you you get into their life father not me you Lord teach them how to live better Lord how to be a better Christian Lord teach them how to pray teach them how to seek you father Lord just be with us now as we pray Lord for the sick and The Afflicted Lord the ones the ones that are not with us and the ones that are here today we pray that you would give them a supernatural touch Lord be with us Lord in the further of this service we give it all to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen all right in the beginning was the word where was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh what kind of word is it it's a Living Word not a dead word not a dead letter it's a Living Word of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace truth you can be seated in the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word second Peter 1 verse 5 says besides this giving all diligence add to your faith verse in the verse your knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness we're going to try to get to 10 patients we'll try to get to that sorry I probably preached a little bit this morning but I think we'll just kind of drop back and teach a little bit this afternoon slow down a little bit so that's all right with you man in your patience possess you your souls we're gonna we get to patience you're going to have to see that that patience brother Brown what do you say the first thing we had to have patience with not our neighbor not our somebody sitting beside you in church he said have patience with God so you got to have patience with God that he'll do what he said he will do all right so that's what we've got to do because I'll read you a quote where brother Brown said if you go out beyond the program of God you're just gonna keep up on the side of the road he says crap scrap heaps of ministers that go out past the program of God and we've seen it you've seen it we've all seen it we've seen him take a message and and brother Brown preached even you know like running without a message and all those things and you know running from the presence of the Lord you got to be in the right season at the right time and you've got to catch the mind of God and I believe that we have caught the mind of God because we know what time that we're living in we know what day I don't say we I say we every all of us sitting in here that we know what is coming we actually know who's going to do it but we know where we're going all right just as I said God knew everything and from the beginning he's now taught us from the beginning what it is that we're looking for where we come from what we're doing here where we're going right and to me that's the as as brother Dale's always said the opening of the seals is knowing where you came from what you're doing here where you're going well that's the whole Plan of Redemption the full plan not just to get your soul redeemed The Saul redeem started on the day of Pentecost that's and don't get me wrong but that's a 2 000 year old Doctrine that's a 2 000 year old Doctrine all right and it never gets any any any worse it gets better but add to your new birth so we're going to add to that what happened on the day of Pentecost back 2000 years ago in 80 30 back in that in that time where they were in the upper room so we're going to add to that because what happened to Peter when Peter came out of that upper room he was the spokesman but remember he didn't write first Peter II Peter until a little bit later called you one filled with the Holy Ghost until then he didn't know how to get virtual knowledge and 10 patience and godliness and brotherly kindness but then he realized what God was doing in his life saying what your brother Brown and brother Brian was born again I think he's back in the 20s I think he got the new birth back somewhere in that way in his 20s he said he's born in 1909 I believe it was and and but he didn't preach statue of perfect man until 1960 whatever it was 61 62. why he hadn't come to that stage yet he had to grow in Grace and knowledge just like me and you have to grow in Grace and knowledge he had to come from a baby listen you know what happened let me tell you what happened to brother Brown remember his first sermon he said I preach and and remember he preached and and hope he was illiterate hope had to read the Bible hope read the scripture and then he preached well the first sermon he preached you know I remember he thought man this is good I did a good job everybody enjoyed it and he goes behind and goes in the pastor studying the pastor Dr Davis looked at him and he said worst sermon I've ever heard brother Brown said what but they cried what brother what Dr Davis say they cry at funerals yeah all right so it wasn't an emotion so hey you know what that tells me if brother Brown can bomb in his first sermon so can we don't worry about when some of you get old get you know start preaching and you bomb don't worry the prophet bombed his first sermon all right I'm sorry that's what he said and I love it when brother Branham he's so honest and honest to tell us his his mistakes and honest to tell us even what he was thinking that he didn't have to tell you in me but praise God what was in his mind came out of his mouth now you and I may have a problem with that but if you're a prophet and let you and let God take control it's all right all right so add to your new birth so he so when brother Brown got bored again he had to add to brother Adam's new birth brother had to take a walk through justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost as we were talking about this morning water to the ankles water to the knees water to the loins and then a river that you couldn't even you had to swim in it you had to learn how to swim all right now with the ankles you don't have to learn how to swim with the knees you don't have to learn how to swim even at the loins you could just walk through the water but buddy when it gets up about 10 foot deep you're going to either drown or learn how to swim one of the two all right so we're going to learn how to swim in this word of God all right get by with me we're going to minister nourishment look Minister nourishment to each one of us this ought to not be this ought to be the this ought to be the happiest time of our life to be able to sit in a congregation and hear the word of God and be able to sing the words of God they were the young adults were downstairs get my hand clap these younger dogs I'm telling you these young adults I see too many sitting out there on the on the street corners doing their stuff and they're enjoying it but I walked in that room and there was a song that been playing on the radio that I enjoyed it doesn't matter who's singing it you've heard me say that before I don't care who sings it they're all lost if I ain't got the new birth Toby Mac or anybody but it's the anointing behind the words that were that spoken that's true if they're saying about God that's true so this song Gyra I know you probably all a lot of you Maverick city news or Maverick City whatever it is not news and maybe receiving news what is it anyway so this this these PL these they sing it anyway it doesn't matter but they're getting together and they're saying and they have a choir and they have this guy playing the organ and or the piano and he's a black guy and I come to find out somebody says well he's a rapper I don't care the anointing to that song saying that Gyra Jehovah Jireh my provider and they sing that song and I walked in there and I told the young adults I said you've heard this song and they said yes I said I'd like for you to sing it um April for the uh well y'all don't know this but I I try to uh um voluntold when you hear these songs up here usually it's me asking them to do it either getting Sister Christine and and they're getting old now cantankers they're not doing it anymore so I went straight to the kids I didn't say you sister Trudy oh I'm sorry but I told them and I said go tell the you so I walked in there and I said hey guys you hear this song yep laid it down played it for him they said yep well they could have sung it today so much talent and a nine-year-old kid was leading them Zoe be led by a child I'm sorry she's 10. Lord Mercy forgive me goodness gracious but they jumped right in while you're saying these youth they get they get into that anointing and they know how to use it so I appreciate them singing those songs like that and I said you don't take it by that anointing out there you take it by your anointing to the people and if you say it by that anointing by the anointing of winning as always turn out right always turn out right so man they practice just a few times and they was they was comfortable with singing it so um I thank God that we've got a group of people that'll come together and sing those songs because I believe God's in song too you know right let's jump through this let's jump to this real quick so what was the fourth thing the fourth part of life is what the word we we looked at the dry bones we looked at the going into the water I'm going to try to get to these verses if you don't mind so what is it it's that Holy Ghost Bunch us Bunch us people being honed out so that it can fit the same kind of ministry he had when he went away that when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing who's the whole thing I'm looking at the whole thing he's not going to wrap your cars and airplanes and it's not going to Rapture your message book either it's not going to rap through your computer it's going to Rapture human beings that are born again by the Breath of God that have took the word of God and then there's going to be a group inside of a group come on somebody there's going to be a group brother Brown said there's been Brides brides churches Brides he's ever tell come one this is the one there's not another one we didn't we didn't have a we didn't have a preview of the bride and then a second preview of the bride and the third preview of the bride and then the fourth no brother Brown said it was two previews Alpha bride Omega bride the Omega bride got out of line it took a profit to get her back in line well you know what I believe we're back in line I just believe we're back in line so if we're back in line then this can happen it'll catch the whole thing in the Rapture with the Justified Sanctified baptism of the Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand again the house of God will live again the Tree of Life where is that tree of life it's inside of you brother Brown said Christianity versus idolatry look he says we are made for takers of his Holiness we In His Image we are living images of a living God he don't want dead people he wants a lot of people he wants you dead to yourself look then dead to self raised with him now listen his word made flesh again in US O Brother Neville look what is it not the mythical imaginary God sitting out there but the Living God what is the Living God there's your answer the word in you makes it real glory to God oh I know you think I'm a Holy Roller maybe I am maybe I thought I hollered a little bit too much this morning but you know what get used to it but oh brother do you see it trap over every denomination trap over all paganism and I'm going to say over all your issues over all your problems he will help you because look the word of God which is God is made flesh in you because look the word of God and the word of the devil like I said before you take a high priest that high priest could only take the confession of the people back before God same way with God and and and Jesus Christ being our mediator there's not three different gods but it's a position did not Jesus pray he said father I pray that as you and I are one that the bride and mere one amen so we've had that prayer prayed over us in John 17. we've had that that he wouldn't take you out of the world Lord I'm not praying to take them out of the world in other words I don't want them to just have a flowery bed of ease I want them to be in the world but not of the world Lord he said father protect them so where's our protection come from our protection comes from our father amen every one of you that are fathers you are the protector you're your daughter's Holy Ghost until she gets it in the natural form and the word of God which is God is made flesh in you why you're seated in Heavenly places triumph over all things in Christ Jesus that's why I was telling them when they were singing you raise yourself up into a Heavenly atmosphere they may sing it and be a bunch of prostitutes and be a bunch of whoremongers but that song's anointed and when we catch the true anointing of that guess what that's what God wanted to start with that's what puts us in Heavenly places that's what puts me to be able to listen to that song and not have to worry about the past life or whoever's in it but I want them to sing it I want to hear it from their voice I want to hear from somebody who knows who Jehovah Jireh is that knows he's your provider all right I'm preaching now stop tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested outside of this time right now we are now Sons and Daughters of God we're not going to be when was ever a time in history listen we talk about Lincoln and we talk about Washington and we talk about all these great people that we read about in history they're gonna all if they're not born again they're going to vanish they're not even going to be in your memory but there'll be a William Branham in your memory there'll be a Ron Spencer in your in your memory they'll be a Johnny Reagan a Samuel Dale a bob black that'll be in your memory that'll be what this world is waiting on it's not waiting on some great Jeff bezo or some great somebody else it's waiting on you things written in heaven your name's written in the palm of his hand what is the time to deliver all nature God deliver my nature first deliver this guy waiting for the time of manifestation why before the atonement was made before the Holy Ghost was ever poured out in the Old Testament on down there couldn't have been manifestation so who's making history you and I today are making history amen when we go through a testimony when we go through and we get healed or we get delivered from something you're making history you're making history that nobody else is gonna make sure Abraham Lincoln was a good president but he'll never be anymore I believe he was a Christian because brother Adam said he was a Christian so we'll get to see Abraham Lincoln but if he's not born again don't give me the presidency give me being the bride that's the manifestation of God that he wants he don't want you to be a good person God has never wanted you to be a good person there's a lot of good people it's going to be in hell but he wants you to be him he wants you to understand what he's saying he wants you he wants you like I said this morning that deep part of you that calls what's it calling for it's calling for him to come here because the coming of the Lord is what to the wall to the to the to the recorder to the to the uh you know no the coming of the orders to be in you the coming of the middle it's a revealing of you it's being revealed to you you're making history shaping up to a headstone to the manifestation the sons of God coming back and the spirit of God coming into these men look so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ to join him in his church together how's that going to happen Ephesians 4 12. Apostle prophets pastors teachers and evangelists for what our perfection for the Perfection of the Saints if you're a saint then you're going to get perfected by that way in no other way are you going to get perfected then we talk about then we were talking about the two Prophets they're all waiting on waiting on that whole anointing that whole Malachi uh four anointing to them is waiting right here that Revelation is what is it seven or so where the two prophets go to Israel it's waiting right here it's barred there's no way it's going to go over there brother George until we're out of the way until he the bride be taken out of the way there's no way that scripture is going to be fulfilled we got to fulfill our part first listen Luther fulfilled his part God put him away he fought Wesley fulfilled his part put them away they all had a part listen they had a part in that plan I was talking about this was God's method of achieving an end and how many of you heard brother Dale say many many times he said what is the coming of the Lord what is the seventh seal brother Ryan said it's the end of all things well it's none then we're finished there's nothing else no it's the end of the struggling world he said it's the ends of this Cosmos it's the end of your issues whatever it is when we get over there we'll get delivered from it all right this is where we're gonna get delivered from it oh we are not going to get delivered from it and whose choice is that don't point at me I gotta point it myself look watch they uncover and open it up he's talking about the Sixth Seal so the Sixth Seal has got to in the spiritual form open with us on Earth not in the natural form it opens when the two witnesses appear to Israel and the Gentile church has got to be gone so by that we know that the seals were open to the Gentiles and that we're not here anymore the Raptors took place actually the dead in crisis Rose first and there will be changed so the body change there's glorified people walking all over the world all over the world yes because why because they've captured listen man has tried to capture nature clouds tornadoes man has tried to figure out a way to control all that so what have they figured out now they're controlling Me and You by the things that we do or don't do that covid-19 you believe whatever you want to it was a control Factor it was something to see how much you'll take and how much you'll not take see how much you'll do and how much you'll not do because listen we were talking about it yesterday me and somebody oh it was talking at the the Baptist friend that's first cousin of ours what one item I want to ask you something what one item that you can ever think of since you were a kid till now what one item took only about maybe two weeks to shut this whole world down oh we've had E coli over here we've had the Spanish Flu over here we've had this that we hear that happens over here we hear that this happened we had some smallpox at one time you know he and you had a group of what in two weeks they spread all over the world it was just like it was just like a it was just the demon but it just spread all over the world in a matter of two weeks control but what do we got to do as uh we'll get into patience in a minute because then the Bible says impatience like I said possess you your soul you've got to you've got to pull that thing down and say hey we got to believe God we gotta believe God for everything we make mistakes we make we got issues and problems that's okay we're going to have them until the day we get out of here but we're going to have to know how to handle them and you don't handle them by disappearing do you bro George thank you you do not have and me too I ran from this thing I'm looking to a bunch of people that's run from God in their life I got one amen and one that's it so the rest of y'all are Saints I'm preaching to these two right here me and me and these two right here are going to get it thank you very much go ahead but it is something we got to go through but we're going to come out on the other side but you can't be separated from God that Satan that wants to separate this thing let's continue on Psalms 42 verse 7 says deep calleth into the deep at the noise of thy water spout all thy waves and thy Billows are gone over me what happened brother Adam he walks through the he walks through the forest and he looks down at him and I see it on my route I've got a place on my route that two Springs come together and they just come out of nowhere I mean it's just Woods everywhere it's right on the side of the road right where the mailboxes are basically one up here or one down here and one up there um and you watch them even if it's not rain to drop back in the summertime here's this little bitty trickle of water running all the time now buddy of the last few weeks it's been like a flood but where'd it come from it come from that sprinkle there's nothing above it but just a big old slope going up to a couple of houses but there's a couple indentions in that in that Hill and that's where what that pressurized water from way down deep inside it's pushing between something a rock or a root or something just pushing right through between that and it's running through there doesn't take anybody you don't have to have a pump it just runs by itself and that's why Brother Bear looks at that stream he said why you do that you feel so you can cool the deer down so I can take a drink and do it no he said if the Supreme could have spoke what would it say there's something down inside of me that's pushing that water up out of the ground that's my question to you is there something inside of you pushing this word out of this ground listen folks we can't be dilatory anymore we played around with this thing long enough you either got to get excited are you gonna get left and I don't mean excited like shouting and running up in all the aisles you got to get excited about the word of God Amen you know what people will know if you get excited basically some of you that hadn't moved in years yeah I believe in Emotion sorry man what's a baby do when it comes out of the womb no screams let that word so oh she's asleep hit your niece she'll scream for you if you need it she ain't been quieter day in her life in that right and that's okay listen I'd rather her scream and keep everybody awake praise the Lord anyhow now before when the Deep calls for the Deep look before that can be a deep call there had to be a deep to respond in other words there had to be water there had to be water under pressure before that could be pushed out of the ground and then it just flow and be the prettiest white I mean not white but the purest Clear Water you've ever seen comes from a spring there's a River of Life flowing out a pure stream of water are the word of God before there can be a deep call there has to be a deep to respond to it as brother Rams says many times and you hear him he said there's Scott which one came first the fish or the water if the fish came first he just flops and dies but the water came first because God knew the fish would need the water so he knew we'd need the word of God he didn't just throw us out there and say here fight for yourself no he's right there fighting with us every time every day we just deny come on we just deny we need help we're in denial and denial is a river think about that for a minute it is there was something in there called out for more of God you might have been living in a Justified State before God but you want the baptism of the Holy Spirit and you hungered for it the very reason that there is a holy spirit is because you're hungering for it the very reason that Peter stood up and said add to your faith first you acknowledge temples patience he wanted to us to be as brother around said a Powerhouse a Powerhouse in this world in this dark world I read it to you he put us in the darkest place that he could put us you me cause he knew somebody would overcome somebody would make it I'm just dumb enough to believe it's me and y'all it's going down a little bit further and as I said this morning there's nothing of such prevailing power as a revelation of the word like I said this morning there's been enough Revelation preached in this building for us to take a rapture what are we doing with it though oh we lay out of church we sleep during church we we have issues we all don't have issues we all gonna have problems but when are we going to realize that this is better than anything out there this is going to sustain you where that out there won't if you think your job is God's going to take it away from you you know what that's if you're a child of God and know what brother Ram said and I'll tell you in my own words you think so much of your job and your car and your whatever it is God's going to take it away from you if you're a child of God because he's not going to put anything in your way for you to become a child of God all right but if not we'll just die for a rap so there's nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation Ephesians 1 17 the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him that just kind of puts all that together look the eyes of your understanding not the eyes of your body right my eyes are going bad some of y'all wear glasses that you didn't wear them before some of you are going up here going not that my eyes but the eyes of your understanding Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord not the eyes of my physical the eyes of my physical will get me in trouble but not the eyes of your understanding being enlightened look that you may know I want to ask you a question ask yourself during the week do I know who I am do I know what I'm doing here do I know why I'm a preacher do I know why I'm a deacon do I know why I'm a lay person do I know why why do I come to church why do I take communion where do I live above what everybody else lives I'll tell you something everybody thinks this is rules and regulations and I harp on coming to church well I'm not telling I'm just telling you what the Bible says and I'm telling you what brother Brown says see that's what I mean y'all got your your favorite quotes who glory to Darling brother Graham said he also said you can't wait till them doors get open see we don't want them that cuts but it don't cut me you know about what about 20 years ago I guess when I quit drinking yeah I did sorry 22 years ago when we were out in the world bro George the law of um if you blew if you're you know you had one of those breathalyzer things if you blew it started out a long time ago they wouldn't even have one of them take you home well then they said no there's too many people dying of drinking alcohol and car wrecks so we gonna put a lemon on it and it's 1.0 if you blowing this little thing and it's 1.0 you're going to jail all the people scream then it come up to about 10 years later from that they said not needs to be 0.08 oh the people were screaming about that they got the point in this .06 or something I don't even don't even know but if it went to 0.06 are we gonna have a sermon about this are we gonna send it home and go oh my God I don't know how I can live it don't matter if it's point oh if you don't drink that log does not apply to you that's the same way with sin if you don't do it the law doesn't apply to you man there's not a day I don't want to come to church now listen there's time when we have jobs I know that there's time when we have things that we have to do take a vacation that's fine but not 50 of 52. maybe two or 52 but not 50 of 52. see what I mean so I don't want to be so dogmatic if you miss a Sunday if you want to go on vacation fast your travel day I've done it before okay but then two Sundays later and then the third Sunday after that and then the fourth Sunday after that you'd be surprised we kept it on the calendar how many times you've got it here and how many times you didn't see I don't have to worry about that I do not have a calendar it says the days I go to church the days I don't because I go to church that make me better than you no no that law that God said not forsaken assembling yourself together that don't apply to me because I do it because I love him you don't think about that sometime I do it because I love him I don't do it because I have what brother Dale listen they I've known him longer than your health yeah but there's been days he has not one to come search there's days he did not want to preach the sermon in this pulpit because of sickness Because Of Heartache because of y'all and US me I'm talking about y'all I'm talking about all of us but did he ever Miss Heavenly days no he didn't miss like the old the old joke about the you know the wife said honey we need to get him go to church he ain't going to church today she said you got to go to church he said I ain't nothing but a bunch of Hypocrites go to that church he said I ain't going she said honey you got to get him to go to church he said I ain't gonna none of them people they they all like none of them they don't like me either she said honey you got to go you're the pastor but you think every day roses puppy clouds no but he that overcometh well I grant yeah now see that's a promise the promise in the Bible not that I'm gonna dump you in here but you're gonna overcome whatever it is out there in the world well here I go again but I want us to be us to be the true church I don't want us to be somebody that just halfway does stuff none of us I don't want to believe that quote brother round said there's mate Believers unbelievers and True Believers in every crowd especially when he gets down there on Wednesday night where they ain't but about 20 of y'all here we got to looking around praise the Lord anyhow there's another one in quotes we don't like especially when the congregation gets lower and lower and lower and it doesn't matter with several hundred people's here was like well if ma'am no it's probably you but crossing the true church now look true church so there's a false church right remember we talk about the two vines or the two Church we're talking about the the knowledge of Good and Evil and the tree of life but brother Brown said their their Vines were intertwined you couldn't really tell the difference because well listen the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is a religious tree it come from Satan who is way more anointed than not some of us are he was anointed for we was on Earth I didn't say in heaven I said on Earth but there's a true church and I'm going to contend I'm going to fight for that to find that true church you need to fight for that truth you need to find that true church not just about hey he said well then brother I said at home you've not found that true church because you got to put all the scriptures together can't do away with these over here okay just because that law is in is in force of the drinking alcohol it's still there in case you slip up hello somebody all right but for us that don't drink what does it matter you see what I mean that's the way I look at the word of God if you do what the word of God says the best you can I mean the best you can the best you can then that do's and don't stuff doesn't apply to you and me if you do it I bet that deep is a Love That No One Ever Knows listen I love you with all my heart but if she decide to leave this message and go somewhere else staying right here because this is where the Deep comes from we see the people leaving the message like crazy now why there was no deep there was no new birth to respond to the preaching although I wanted to find this over here and there wasn't this over here brother Brown missed it here this would miss it here this miss it here well you can pick all you want to but Christ in the true church is what a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows highly at the Antichrist Spirit now that's what we're dealing with now and let me tell you let me make a point here reason I've been reading this and I hadn't said what this was but the reason I've been reading this one quote is that Antichrist spirit is right there the opposite of that oh god listen the devil wants you to have virtue he wants you to have a little bit of power that he gives you oh he surely wants you to have knowledge sure it does but you got to be able to discern whether it's his knowledge or God's knowledge you got to discern whether it's the temperance that God give you where God himself could walk into a sanctuary and he could plant a rope and he could make a plan of what he's fixing to do and he drives them jokers out of that Temple but he did one thing me and you can't do he went and died for him even though he drove him out he went and died for him can you do that God bless God anyway the Antichrist is going to what come into the church make it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan Reveals His work that's what we're doing now that's why a lot of times you don't need discernment in a church service daddy will tell you and all the other ministers to tell you you don't need discernment because you can see the demon in your face mine too demons bother you right now right now listen if he can look right there if he can discredit God's word what does it need to start at right here he needs to start right here if he's going to discredit the word of God if he discredits this ministry then he's got all of you just one big he's got 100 people or 80 people that's why many women in popularity brother Brown said the three things that'll do it they'll do a a preacher in many women in popularity wouldn't stay away from it but the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he's casting the Lake of Fire he fights it he's fighting now he knows that the people get the true revelation of the true church all right you got to know there's a false in the truth and they're sitting in every congregation and what she is and what she stands for you got to make a public announcement I am standing for the word of God and that public statement is made known because you don't drink you don't smoke you don't chew you don't curse your sisters don't cut your hair there's your declaration that God's word's right what she stands for and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern that's why knowledge is discernment you got to know that's why Brothers tell you they'll tell me many many times they love preaching here some don't some do most do because there's not a pushback when they make a statement listen if you go to another church well some of you are not preachers but if we go to another church and we preach we hit a point and when we hit that point you just put in Brackets they're all shaking their head you put that point right here it's just soon you read the headlines of the newspaper in the Atlanta Journal Constitution because you gotta back up and explain what you just said because you feel that pushback or you preach something like this Daniel 7 weeks something a little controversial something a little deep you really get a you get a real you know you get a push back you kind of hit a wall well that's the spirit of God Discerning I'm sorry Discerning that they don't know what they think they know and not to share some you know don't let her head swell but like I said before we've been taught in this church taught and when you try to take teaching to another place and they're not used to it it really shuts them down hey man Bob Luis dad yeah all of you we know that for a fact and I'm not making anything out of it as far as us but it's a discernment that we go through it's the knowledge of God that we know what we're talking about I'm sorry we do because we've been taught well and we can discern you can discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit because what is an antichrist spirit it's not out there anything against the word of God is anti thing against a word of God is anti so it's Antichrist anti-anointed spirit but look if we can see that and overcome it Satan will be powerless do you believe what Brother Martin says she'll be he'll be powerless before her listen in the Garden of Eden Satan walks up in the form of the Beast and by his subtility he overpowers the bride of Adam he overpowers her with his influence with his spirit with his with his uh lust and his and all the things and she falls for it she falls for it and Adam couldn't save her because he's not a savior so he took her and said I'll take her sin we're going to live this way God said I'll put enmity I'm gonna put a division here but I'm going to come back and I'll make sure that this next bride is not gonna fall we read it this morning I'll read it again Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it not Revelation just what we get in this building if it's really revealed to you it's like brother Dale's always said how can you talk somebody out of a revelation if it's a real one it it becomes a part of you just like your hand your finger you can't deny it once you get a revelation how somebody gonna talk you out of water baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ I can't can't but they'll try they'll try but look the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against us the bride but we will prevail over them here's right here why why would God call a people out of this evil age for his name the reason it is is the Trier his bride when she has made manifest been tried been proven proved to who not to the world to the Devil Himself like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end as the seed starts in the ground it comes up through carrier's life but it ends up the same seed as it was when it went in the ground and the same way the seed now who's he talking about Jesus Christ said I've got to go in the ground I Gotta Die Alone that I can bring up more fruit then what do we do we don't bring up we bring up stock yes we bring up tassel we bring up shuck but there's seed coming back because the seed is the multiplier and by with me the seed is the multiplier the shot's not the multiplier you can't plant a stalk and get another ear corn you got to plant corn seed to get an ear corn but it's got to go through those stages but it's got to be seed form that's my brother random the spoken word is the Original Seed amen seed shall not be aired with the shuck oh my seed of discrepancy I know a lot of people talk about seed being this and that and the other but I believe that's true seed and it's been planted all right you didn't get it when you're the baby your wife wasn't pregnant when she was born she had to receive seed the same way the seat of Deceit fell on the ground and Eden is the same way it ends up in the last days just as the gospel was when it fell to a denomination at nicaea it ends up in a super organization just as the seat of the church fell back there with signs wonders and living Christ among them it ends up in the last days under the ministry of Malachi 4 and restores back again what's the brother I'm talking about that those first three Church ages they had all the gifts working in their life they didn't have any denominations they didn't have any um trinitarian they didn't have a first Trinity Church on every corner they didn't have a Baptist on every corner Presbyterian no it was a true word of God but they lost it they fell back there had signs and wonders so the ministry of Malachi 4 had to restore that back the original face that was faith that was once given we find now this evil age is to prove to Satan she's not like Eve that she's not that type of a woman and she will be Tried by his word the Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by the word remember she missed it on one phrase he's the same yesterday today and forever but she failed on One Promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and now the people that's called for his name of course is his bride she is to come in contact oh praise God how many is glad to come in contact with the word of God I mean I am contact every word and as we were talking this morning I want God to be proud of us I want our father to be proud of us how's he going to be proud of you if you don't do what he says ain't gonna happen so we got to go through virtue knowledge and get into temperance besides just giving all diligence add to your faith virtue into verse your knowledge and all his Temperance Temperance patience and patience godliness the Greek Lexicon for temperance is what self-control the virtue of one who Masters his desires and passions especially his sensual appetite strong or robust having power over possessed of now look what was virtue virtue was having power now you gotta learn to control it see every one of these virtues are exactly where they're supposed to be you got to have virtue before you can give it so you got to have power but Power without character satanic the prophet said so now we come up to knowledge the knowledge to know where to find out how to get rid of whatever we need to get rid of and then temperance to have power over not using that power in the wrong way I mean how many of you no I'm not going to ask if you could get rid of somebody in your life you would I ain't talking about killing them a murder I'm talking about just get rid of them just never have to deal with them again well you ain't got the temperance yet you need some work because what does temperance do it Masters brother man I'm gonna read you in a few minutes it Masters all circumstances curbing restraining controlling oneself temperate continent then the Bible tell us would be incontinent you know what continent incontinent is don't you be able to hold yourself continent incontinent you can't hold yourself as we get older we should know that yeah Temperance doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol either no no tempers doesn't mean alcohol is cured not in this case this is Bible Temperance Holy Spirit Temperance so he's connecting the two together Holy Spirit Temperance not Temperance out there in the world to quit drinking listen if you're not drinking you don't need that kind of temperance right I do not have to control myself with a drinking problem you know having a drinking problem I'm over that I'm done with that yeah all right so what's that tempers talking about controlling me in every other way that's just one of the lusts of the flesh but we're talking about Holy Spirit Temperance that means how to control your I'm gonna stop and drink some water right here now let's read that again how to control your tongue not be a toddler everybody's got to know everything just put it on Facebook how to control your temper not fly off every time somebody's peace cross to you help me Lord boy a lot of us going to fall off before we get started now brother Brandon must know something about that aren't we then we wonder why God is not in his church oh no it's a coach Joyce won't get right how many times brother tells many men it's just cause now if brother Dale would get back right if everything's right we'll be out of here now let's work on us first right ain't as right as I want to be but I'm more right Than I Used to Be same way with each one of us I believe we've grown this past year I believe a lot of people have really really grown and showed that they want to like I said before that Deep's got a call to want to go up that statue of perfect man that deep wants to make that we get better not better people better Christians boy a lot of us going to fall off before we get started aren't we then we wonder why God is not in his church so how important is these virtues then we wonder why God is not in his church doing Miracles and things that they used to do that's why we lost those virtues from the first church to right now that's why I took a prophet to preach in 1962 in October the stature of a perfect man why didn't he preach it in 1957 why didn't he preach in 1947 why didn't he preach in 1960 wasn't ready for it didn't have all the virtues in line Maybe I know he didn't when he was a kid remember he would have been a murderer and he would have been he'd have committed suicide twice we can go on and on everybody with me okay and I'm telling you not stories I'm telling you stories he told it's on tape and it's his voice he told us he was going to commit suicide he told us he was going to grab that wire right he told us he loaded that gun to shoot them boys with he told us he was going to take that whoever killed his dog and he's going to kill them wow and we followed this man yeah because he's human and he had a gift add Temperance to it old Temperance how to answer look in kindness when Wrath it spoke to you somebody says you bunch of Holy Rollers down there don't jump up and run and pull your sleeve roll your sleeve up see not that remember brother I'm the same thing remember the teacher told him to put the little string around his tie ten knots or count to 10 or whatever it was said he got to about three throwed it down rolled his sleeves up and went whipping them boys so they went to whipping him one of the two oh the prophet yep but later on he told that guy was fixing to break his face in he said no that ain't happening tonight what'd he say he said something deep came up and he said I felt sorry for that person I didn't want to kill him two people up in the up in the balcony a man and a woman a boy and a girl making love in the in the congregation during the service brother I'm told him stop stop that stop that well what would me and you have done yeah the holy spirit said whatever you say that's what will happen and with eyes that may have looked like a little bit maybe he was mad at one time because they were desecrating the house of God he said I forgive you he said they could have carried them out in the stretch or dead if I'd have said it he said but I prayed for their Saul I looked at the soul of those people and knew they needed to be saved the same way brother Devils looked at all of us we go through all this junk that we go through he's looking at your soul he's not looking at you all right praise God don't jump out and roll up your sleeve no not that that talk with Godly love Temperance kindness is that the way you want to be congregation says amen when you're riled up that didn't say you'll never get riled up see how that's written when you're riled up raw not back let him be your example I don't think brother Brown knew anything about road rage but the devil of that road rage was there at that time it's just manifest itself now because every time we people hey somebody passed me the other day and I mean he was flying pass on a double yellow line and praise God for stop signs the great equalizer it's a traffic light because he's like got caught in the light going up here in Rapid town he got caught in that light he couldn't get under it he got caught in that light and I pulled it right behind him I just smiled away I said you just wasted 20 worth of gas just to get 22 feet in front of me so anyway if thou be the Son of God turn these stones into bread he could have done it see there's there's a power inside of us that can do these things anybody with me there's a power inside of you to create a world and go live on it but why would we want to do that now we're here to save get Soul safe we're here to we're here to manifest the word of God oh it'd be real easy listen brother Brandon was full of these of these uh quirks and all he he said Lord I just want to go up on the up in the highest mountain remember storm down like Elijah and just and go right back up and he said no you're a people person you're a people Prophet the people you have to live with your people and I love what uh one brother was saying the other day a shepherd's got to smell like a sheep the good and the bad think about that if a new Shepherd comes in the Sheep are like that ain't Our Shepherd no because he hadn't lived with him you got to live with your people so you know what Jesus Christ took on our smell the odor of death the odor of sin he took that on us on him from us and now he's the great Shepherd that though you may stink like sin every once in a while even after you're born again he's still the shepherd standing right there with you with us with one of those Shepherd hooks of love not a fish hook a Shepherd hook when they called him Belgium he said I'll forgive you for that they pulled a handful of beard out of his face and spit in his faces come down off the cross he said father forgive him they don't even know what they're doing when he had the gift he note all things for in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily they had seen him perform Miracles by telling people what was wrong with him and so forth they put a rag around his head and around his eyes and hit him on the head and said prophesy tell us who hit you we'll believe you see he had temperance now if you got it like that add that to your faith if you still blow up and Sass and fuss and stew and carry on uh-huh you ain't got no you can't add that because it won't add it won't vulcanize you couldn't take a piece of rubber you know and vulcanize it to a piece of iron it just won't work no it's got to be flexible didn't didn't God tell us he put a heart of Flesh inside of us and take the Heart of Stone out because Stone hard flesh is pliable rubber's pliable you know vulcanize it to a piece of iron you can't do that it just won't work now it's got to be flexible just like the rubber is and when your faith and your Temperance looks becomes the same kind of Holy Ghost Temperance that he has then it will vulcanize with him you're added to it let's keep reading just for a second and we'll we'll um take communion when your knowledge is like his knowledge I come to do thy will oh God see what the father's word he defeated every devil with the father's word he defeated every devil heavens and earth will pass away but the word will not see when you got that kind of knowledge it'll vulcanize with your faith when you get the right kind of temperance like he had it'll vulcanize if you hadn't just a man-made halfway soused up most of y'all know what that means you're in this from the south you should know it South step belief or Temperance all ought to slap him down but maybe better not because they might put my name in the paper or Facebook or Instagram or Twitter those of you that don't know that Luis does ask him Netflix no they won't put you on Netflix I guess and do that you're not that famous because they might put your name in the paper about it that ain't the kind of tempers he's talking about because you know one time back in the Old Testament there was a prophet of God he was walking down the road and a bunch of children came up to him and started harassing him start calling him names see we hate it you can do a lot of things but don't call me a name because I take that personal you're talking to me don't do that to me you talking about me you talking about me yeah I'm talking about you but what happened there was no love in that prophet's eyes as far as agape love he turned and looked at him and he said in other words curse you and two bears two she Bears two big grizzly bears ate those are killed those 40 kids he didn't have temperance he didn't have Holy Ghost Temperance because he didn't have the Holy Ghost but me and you got what would we do if somebody kept harassing us and telling us yeah same way with with all of us if we keep hammering on something like coming to church and different things if y'all could call two she Bears Out of the Woods you would I don't want most people do they want you to shut up if you start digging into their demons you say all that's never happened how many times you got people if Donnie was here his dad brother Tom bless his heart he tried his best but sometimes he was he was the two she bears and he was a little over we all know we all if everybody knows him they chuckling they laugh that's just the way brother Tom was but he didn't have a lot of temperance for people that didn't like the word of God okay he just he didn't he'll tell you if he's sitting here today he'll tell you but you know what he's on the other side he ain't got to worry about that no more because remember that has an end that's had an expiration date the day he passed from this life into the other life he ain't got to worry about that no more he ain't got to worry about hurting people's feelings but brother Tom buddy I'm telling you if he if he start digging into you it was like them claws were going and it was done with love okay but you didn't want to be around him Anna sister me either me either he'd come at you I mean with if he had if it's such thing as a full Barrel done he he wanted at you I mean it's like and it wasn't pointed at you you had him right here but he was doing it out of love he was trying his best to get you to see the word of God like he could see it his Zeal was overwhelming and you know what happened I don't want to be around him I see him over there how many people never mind I ain't gonna jump in your life you ever seen somebody you didn't I won't be around yeah that's why that's why when you look at somebody that's got Temperance like brother Branham did he didn't avoid nobody he knew they hated him he knew they wanted to destroy him uh um religiously or or in that Realm or discredit him they're doing it now but he knew they were discrediting him and he didn't know you didn't know as an outsider you never knew who he liked and didn't like you know what you know what Billy Paul said he said that was one great thing my daddy had you couldn't tell who was his enemies and who was his friends he just brought them all drew the circle bigger and just grabbed big old bear hugs and started pulling them in we don't do that we got our favorites and you let it know I like that person I like that person I like that person I liked that I don't like that person I like that person I like that one now I like him now I like her I don't like that one over there do you like that no one like that one but when you can really with the sweetness from your heart forgive every man we still believe brother Brown was a prophet right I'm reading the quote hold your peace let it be gone see then it'll vulcanize you can add that to your faith and then I remember I read you this and we'll read it again for those of you that weren't here the impact of vulcanization on rubber science directives must be true someone from the internet explains that vulcanization changes the physical properties of rubber by forcing it to retract today we are rubber right of course there are mechanical methods that can force rubber to retract as well the difference with vulcanization however is that it retains the original shape of the rubber when vulcanization is performed on rubber the rubber shrinks while retaining its original shape may I shrink and let God raise up vulcanization essentially scales down rubber to a smaller size make me small Lord all without deforming or altering its shape in addition to altering your size while retaining its shape vulcanization also protects rubber from future deformation praise God praise God I don't want to be deformed in the future if it's done right it won't as it shrinks rubber hardens and becomes less vulnerable to deformation it may still deform when exposed to enough stress can everybody raise their hand on that one yep we had stress we got it okay but remember when you put stress on rubber what does it do it just when you let go of it it just snaps right back into place again you ought to try that sometime let some of your stress go and let it snap back in place but vulcanized rubber won't deform as easily as conventional non-vulcanized rubber rubber also becomes harder when vulcanized which substantially subsequently increases its tensile strength as we receive these virtues God's Vulcanizing them to us if we do it right and we become what weaker we become stronger amen guess what it says we become stronger by the vulcanization process it's tensile strength and risk of physical damage my light with thermoplastic chemical process the effective vulcanization are permanent praise God after a rubber object our material has been vulcanized it can't be reversed once you get Temperance and that vulcanized resist to your soul and it's Godly Temperance you cannot lose that just like you cannot you lose your new birth it can't be reversed so no devil no Spirit evil can go in and play with it and then pull it apart if it's been vulcanized and how what is the vulcanization process Heat Heat it'll heat and meld together and be twice as strong may God do that to each and every one of us may he put us in that fiery furnace oh I don't want going to fire first Lord put me in there put me in that fire furnace because you know what I know what's going to happen that's going to be a Fourth Man stand up there's gonna be somebody up here that's going to help me into that fan that fiery furnace and I'm going to come out not smelling like smoke but be with that Fourth Man listen to Fire Let's stand our feet we'll start on patience next week let's go to the Lord in prayer dear heavenly father thank you for this day you give us now as we lord stand at attention and Lord we come here with hungry hearts Lord to take communion and Lord be able to commune with you closer Lord I don't want to feel like I have to run away from you the prophet of God preached a sermon running from the presence of the Lord and many prophets have done that in the past many men many great men have tried to hide themselves Gideon and all the different ones have tried to hide from the presence of the Lord because there's a there's a reverence there there's an anointing but Lord God you told us that we need to come boldly to that throne we need to ask and receive what we ask for Lord so we come boldly today Lord and if there'd be anybody hearing the sound of my voice whether it's on internet or here that needs healing father I pray that the healing virtue of the Lord Jesus Christ will take over and we'll Lord show us your power by that great healing anointing can't take it out of the church it's still there Satan you don't have any clue about healing you always want us to be as brother Joel says why is he wow as you woo but Lord I pray that you'd bind Satan every time that he wants to do that Lord I pray you bind him and that we can take positive to the Lord Jesus and let him take that petition to you father and Lord come boldly to the throne and hand that petition to our high priest who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities that Lord we not be negative then we're not we're not say negative things Lord it will say things that are positive that Lord if we need something we'll stand up and say Lord I need you I need you to save my children I seize you Lord help me with my finances Lord I I need you to help me with my spiritual walk and Lord we come boldly to that not not hiding behind a tree or behind a bush but Lord You're our father and as the Bible says what father would not give a son that's hungry a piece of bread but give him a rock Lord you're not that way Satan is but you're not Lord we have not because we ask not so Lord I pray that you would be with this congregation Lord made through this week and coming on into the next couple weeks Lord his brother Jack's getting ready to come Lord and brother rest behind him Lord that you'd give us a fervor Lord a a fresh anointing that Lord as the anointing is of a Revival is falling even on the denominational World there in Kentucky Lord thank you for that it's helping the people but father we're your bride and we call out for our bridegroom to come on the scene and give us the things that we need father forgive us of our sins and our mistakes that we make in the many little idio secrecies that we we have issues with Lord I pray that you take those out of the way Lord that we might not be bound by by not be bound by by the as we was talking about the the laws of of the alcohol a different thing we're free we're free from the law of sin and death Lord but we bind ourself and I pray that you bring us out from under that Lord let the Deep call to the Deep let us hear from you Lord let us take you Lord and not the world let us take you and not our negative thoughts and our negative ideas we don't like this one and we don't like that one we don't like this way and we don't like that way Lord I pray that you'd take the eye save of the Holy Ghost and that you would sue this with that ointment Lord May the oil as run down Aaron's head to his neck his face shoulders all the way down his body he was just totally Anointed with that oil of the natural Lord I pray that you're anoint us with the oil of the spiritual father that you would give a spiritual revelation spiritual insight Lord let us become more spiritual people from the front to the back Lord just bless us now as we get ready to take this communion father we ask your blessings Lord on the people that are sick the ones that are sin sick Lord the ones that are backslid lord they're all they're all here and now we pray Lord that you would just be with him Lord raise them up for your honor and glory Lord let them be manifestations of sons of God not manifestations of the devil father let us Lord be in your control as the song says you've got it all in control father I pray that you'll be with us now in the further in this service bless each one that's here Lord may as we take this communion that will remember that one evening when you took the Bread and Wine and you said this is a new testament the testator has to die to make a new testament and Lord we live under that new testament in your blood and we take your body as the stripes were laid for us to be healed Lord we thank you for that thank you for salvation thank you for Redemption thank you for placing your own life inside of us there's many people billions of people in this world that need that Lord there's people in this congregation that needs it Lord Lord I pray that you would Minister to them Lord not just here in this building but everywhere they go they do not leave them lady just gnaw at them let it let them Lord not sleep at night until they hear from you Lord until they find the real peace the real Peacemaker the real Joy maker the real Jehovah Jireh our provider and all the other compound names of Jehovah Lord we appreciate all those titles but we know you as husband we're Mrs Jesus Christ and I pray that we begin to act like that Lord and will not make you ashamed that you'll be proud of us I believe in John 17 you were proud of a group of people because you asked the father to protect us while we were here and Lord that protection comes from an eternal God that created the whole world and I thank you for that Lord I thank you for the eyes of our of our spiritual realm have been enlightened we see Revelation that others cannot see it's become a mystery to the world but it's as the prophet said the mystery is now history we don't need the revelation of the serpent say we have it we don't need the revelation of water baptism we have it and Lord may we use it now Lord may we take these things that we preach and Lord may it go to each one of our hearts and that you'll settle us and ground Us in the word of God it's tough Lords you know that you were here there were many times you had such an anointing on you but the people didn't believe in you so you had to leave the room or you had to tell the people to leave so that you could heal and raise Jairus daughter so Lord let those people not be here those Spirits Lord may we not be bound may we be able to preach freely may we be able to receive freely freely receive from the word of God freely receive all the promises of God all the things that you've given us already in the Bible there has not to be another Bible be written it's already here we just got to do what it says father just bless us now in the furtherness of this service as we take communion bind our hearts together in you Lord let there not be any root of bitterness or gal or anything like that Lord that'll separate us from you or even from each other may we bind together Lord as a church around our pastor Lord and pray for him as every day we pray for healing of his body Lord but we also pray for Spiritual healing of all of our bodies that will become to that statue of perfect man somebody that that you're proud of somebody that you can be so proud of you can say hey devil have you considered Spoken Word Church oh you got a hedge around them you man they've been given the word well that's okay go ahead do what you want to but don't take their don't you can't take this life and when job came out of the end of this thing guess what he was twice the man he was before I pray that we've become twice the man because you restored everything to him twice is what you said Lord I pray that you'll give us Lord a blessing from Heaven that we can't contain may this year be a supernatural year for us Lord may it be a time that we learn more from you we learn how to be like you we learn how to act like you act we learn how to do the things that you did I believe if we are believing that we are Christians that that's got to happen because that deep calls into my heart for every person to be able to stand on their own and have their own experience with God in their own virtue and their own knowledge their own Temperance and go through trials Lord and and not be that they have to run and cry and try to find the preacher or the pastor the Lord you'll you'll help them to grow into individuals with God and that they can speak the word just like any of us speak the word Lord and that Satan will have to back up you're defeated devil you just don't know it yet these people know that and Lord we're going to thrive on that because it's a revelation that you can't get father I pray this should be with us now as we take communion bless us in Jesus name amen anybody have a a need or anything before we before we head into the the communion and foot washing we appreciate each and every one of you we appreciate the Lord giving us strength and given us an opportunity to speak or this of God or not you got to decide well it's worth it or not some people it's not worth it some people would rather drink a beer and go to church I was one of them okay I was one of them so don't tell me that Spirit don't get on us all but if you're born again that spirit's gone you want to be here in church or be around the bride I like being around the bride I don't like being around the world do you I'll be glad when this thing is over I'll be glad when I was talking about when this doll has an expiration date this part has an expiration date God does not have one and this world won't have one either if you'll realize what the Bible says that it's just going to burn it over it's going to still be here just like he burnt you over and you're still going to be here then we're going to come and live right here you know why because we weren't born on the moon we weren't born on Mars well somebody may say we were but where are you from I was born on this Earth I was born on this Earth from this Earth right so we have that connection and God so much thought of that he said okay I'll put you back down there because remember when brother Brown went across the curtain of time he was just astonished when they said we don't eat over here we don't have our regular bodies uh uh we got to go back to Earth what he looks back and sees it he said he sees his old decrepit body laying there he said I don't want to go back to that in other words they said look we don't need a drink here in other words they're not complete humans they knew they had to come back and pick up their Earthly bodies that's how much God thinks of me and you he preserves this Earth Burns it off takes care of all the sin Burns it off and lets us live here for an eternity and just enjoy God there's no way we can do it because we're preachers of time we're creatures of of heartaches and trials and tribulations but folks it'll be over not too long let's read for I received of the Lord that which I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me in other words a new testament was coming and when he had given thanks he'd break it and said take ye this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner he took the cup and he's something saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat the bread and drink the cup you do show the Lord's death till he come that's why brother Brown says only Christians should take communion right if you have an ought against somebody say God I'll take care of it but I'm going to take communion I feel good taking it now I'm okay but you better go take care of what you need take care of foreign because you're going to eat and drink damnation if you don't have a revelation about what's going on here all right for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's deathly come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworldly eatest and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body who is the Lord's body me and you for this cause many are weak and sickly among you not Jesus Jesus has made his statement and Paul is now interpolating if you look at your Bible what Jesus said is in red the rest of it is Paul explaining why Jesus said what he did right for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep Paul could observe that that people were taking communion they weren't supposed to and they were dying or they were getting sick or there was problems I'm just reading the Bible because that was his observation it wasn't that he got this Revelation it was going to happen it was happening right then all right he said for he that eateth and drinketh unworldly eatest and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together in the condemnation and the rest will I said in order when I come he he gets up to a group of of people in Corinth and they're they're drinking they're drinking their Mead and all that stuff and getting drunk at the Lord's table that's why he had to come and set that down so no no this is a Lord's Supper this is not your regular meal you need to keep that separate this is what we're doing here this is Discerning the body and blood of the Lord right here it's not that we're just sitting down and calling for a meal you know let's just go to you know Golden Corral and that'll be our Lord's Supper that's kind of what they were doing in Corinthians but Paul being a prophet he comes in now he doesn't you know bless God you're all going to hell no he just told him what to do and you know what I believe they did it because uh some of them got a real good Revelation when he said that some of you will sleep and some of you get sick and some of you gonna die that really I mean well you know that went right here that went right to their soul but they believe if they believe what Paul said so if you believe what the prophet said you believe what I'm telling you same way Happening Here you God discern the body of the and blood of the Lord why do we have issues and problems because we don't do things right amen bro Dale come up here and pray for them for the communion today everybody all right we're good with that I am so we're gonna do it anyway I miss brother Dale standing here going he took bread and blessed it yep there you go you know what to do what do we think opportunity to take this communion yes Lord yeah make it into your honor and your glory make it your way Lord we just committed to you in Jesus Christ it's coming today and we'll understand this more and more because that's what we're going to do at the marriage supper we're going to take communion and Jesus so told us he told us that night right there he said I won't do this until I come I won't do this until I come back and I'm not drinking the food of the vine so he's not up in heaven drinking wine or eating unleavened bread nope you know what he done he transferred that to us see there's so many times that that Jesus Sanctified himself for me and you not for yourself go ahead father we thank you Lord for an opportunity for taking this one and the bread Lord we know that it has symbolic meaning to it amen but there are true meanings we just ask you to commit everything to you and your your ways we love you we honor you in Jesus name amen yes amen Come Morning how warm by the river I'll rest need the evergreen tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's Glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected you're gonna be and I question oh Father how long you get a little bit of patience at Mount Calvary and what it gives me the strength to go on gives me the strength to go on come morning it'll be over with won't have to worry about it no more brother Brown said six to nine o'clock in the morning sometime when the Sun starts coming up we're going to leave this place the resurrection is going to happen and we're gonna be out of here the world will just keep on going never know a thing about it maybe your neighbor will think maybe you went on a vacation or something maybe the neighbor thought maybe you got crazy and went up in the mountain somewhere you know they think you're crazy anyway so you know you disappeared in one of them camps one of them one of them Fellowship meetings or or one of them special meetings that we go to a lot that's all right it'll be a special meeting I promise you that it'll be one like you never had here before that Mount Calvary and he gives me the strength to go on come morning how well that'll be a reality we sing it now but it'll be a reality one day and when it becomes a reality you'll understand and listen to yourself singing this song today you'll hear it and you'll say oh the tolls of life are gonna be over we've come to the end you love the Lord this was made with holy hands and this was made with holy hands so we're doing exactly what the Bible tells us to do we didn't buy this and it's not going to be held over it's going to be burnt the wine is going to be put back together and it's just going to keep getting better and better it just keeps working all the way through for years oh they think they got vintage wine several hundred thousand dollars a bottle not like this one this wine is fixing to go into the Eternal vessel and it's going to become part of us and then the Lord's going to smile down and said hey they're doing what I told them to do let's just give them a special blessing today let's take communion you know I was thinking the other day while they take that up um well it was taken while they're taking this up um you know sometimes we stand around and we talk about um uh Brother Gary Atkins when the ones that went on and I was uh just kind of trying to remember everybody you know the tatums and and brother moat and I'm not finished with my Bible I need to never put my sword down and uh I was thinking about that the other day now whether you think I'm crazy or not that's all right but the thought came to me said well when you call their name said I just reach over and nudge them and say hey they're talking about you hey they're talking about you until they're over there and uh just a bliss you know they're just you know they're in just a a state of euphoria they're not here going we might get to the house today I got to work tomorrow no they're waiting on us they're over there with all the ones just went on with brother Brandon and all the different ones and we say their name over here that's all I was doing I was trying to remember the name different ones all of us has got somebody that's passed on that we're connected to all of us and the thought came to me said well so when you called their name said we just nudge them over there on the other side and say hey they're talking about you you say oh it's crazy I don't think it is how many times did Brother Brown said uh you know Lord let them look over the banister of time and look down and see what's going on I think they do that especially when we say talk about Gary talk about different ones Brother Richard Marlo different ones they're doing it now hey they're talking about you they haven't forgot you but you know what I think they're telling that they're telling the angel to tell back to us hurry up we want to see you again we want to pick up our bodies and we want to be humans again supper being ended the devil now having part in the heart put in the heart of Judas this carrot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that that the father had given all things into his hand he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and later inside His Garment and took a towel and girded himself after that he pouredth water into a basin and began to watch the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel or with he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord are you going to wash my feet Jesus said uh what I do thou knowest not now but probably in just about 11 days You're Gonna understand what's going on day of Pentecost but Thou shalt know hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered and said if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said to him he that is washed and he is not deceived to wash his feet but it's clean every wet and you're clean but not all talking about Judas for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you're not all clean so after he had washed their feet he took his garment laid it down he kind of just he's the buddy you know he just went over there brother George just sat down beside him probably in one of those chairs like that after he got finished because they're all probably going why'd he do that for why'd you do that's our Master that's our that's our teacher uh Peter says Thou Art the son of God why are you doing this and I'm sure that was all in their minds and he deserved it so after he had washed their feet and taken His Garment and sat down he said know you what I've done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily in other words listen listen I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy happy are you if you do them let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this day you've given us I pray as we go in and wash our brothers and sisters feet Lord I pray that you would give us Lord a supernatural charge Lord that that we're doing as you told us to do where every the instructions of what you told us to do Lord we're going to do today Father I pray that you just bless now and be with the ones that are sick that couldn't be here I know there's many that wants to be here during the foot washing and communion Lord I pray that you'd grant their desire Lord of their heart father just be with us
