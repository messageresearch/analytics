========================================

we got plenty to eat and are coming ready to get some more to eat today and uh We've sure had a good time with our family it's good to have everybody together and uh that that makes it all worthwhile let's bow our heads to the Lord Lord we're so grateful to gather together around your word today Lord Jesus I pray God that you'll just bless us Lord as we walk through these scriptures Lord we thank you Lord God as you give your word to uh it it seems like you bypassed all of the wise and all of the ones that uh you chose the like Paul was saying here the weak ones of the world the weak ones to give your to give your your goodness to and we're so grateful Lord this morning we've got plenty to be thankful for and so we thank you Lord for everything you've done for us we ask Lord as you just Quicken the word to our hearts this morning Lord and give us what we have need of Amen now I I don't have any slides this morning so if you got your Bible we'll just turn to First cor 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and uh look in verse 26 where we were kind of studying last Sunday and uh you know we we're we're kind of looking at some of the things Paul told to the Corinthians who were we laid out the last couple of uh lessons that you know the Corinthians were is that Greek city that um lived in a just a lot of debauchery they had U the way that they worshiped was just steeped in sin and go up to the temple and had all the temple prostitutes and different kind of things and and so Paul is uh you you be when when God gets a hold of your life you in that especially in that age just as it does in this AG it certainly sets you apart and makes you look odd and peculiar and and different and so Paul's framing it up to these Believers in verse 26 he said for ye see your calling Brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called and of course they were in that in that Greek City where you know there was a lot of Education people U studyed the different languages they had all this understanding but he's he's he's he's laying it out for him that it it looks like God just bypassed all that wisdom and all the uh religion people of the day just like he has done today but he says in verse 27 that God ha chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen yay and things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord now I I love how Paul packs so much into the things that he saying he he's saying that God will take something that a gospel that the world thinks is just foolishness and will save somebody that's just nothing that God can take something that seems like nothing and save somebody that looks like nothing and make them something and and he'll take the base things of the world and and and and so he's laying all this out so that we know that there's nothing there's nothing in ourselves that we can Glory of and that's really when to meditate on that scripture for you see your calling when you're you're called to Salvation you're called to a purpose there's nothing in yourself that you can Glory of because it's God that did the whole thing when you get you know you're sitting at home maybe and you the mailman comes and you get an invitation to a wedding and you you get that nice looking envelope and you open it up and it says your it's got your name in it or whatever but you didn't invite yourself it's God that give you an invitation and you accepted it now that's really just really see that for if you see your calling to see your calling then you're resting on the uh being identified with it what what God when God calls someone that's predestinated before the foundation of the world and you recognize it it ties you back to the Eternal eternal etal thought of God so your call what is your calling it's it's an invitation to a feast or the Divine invitation to embrace salvation in the kingdom of God you know you so a call is is is something that that you cannot initiate which is what is laid out for us in John 6:44 where Jesus said no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day so to draw means metaphorically to draw by an inward power or to lead or impale now you we we've all experienced that in our own Liv I sure have experienced that you know you you growing up in a message you know in the message you you we'd have the tapes playing in the house and it just like it just fall on deaf ears you know my uh my daddy had read us Bible stories and and at at night and sometimes I'd sleep through it and you'd come to church and you just well you know it's just it's a thing but then one day the father gets to work it on your heart and he begins to draw on you so no man now this is such an important scripture because it seems like we you know we get frustrated with one another sometimes get frustrated with your kids I I we were we were sitting around talking the other night about a young man or or I'll say a young person that we were we were you know just watching over the years and and uh you you want them to come to the Lord and and you get simply kind of like real frustrated and everything but uh but you know God's got everything in his time and and you could you could take a paddle and and whoop him or and I'm not talking about Zach I'm just talking General that sounds like I'm talking about Zach but I'm not maybe those things could apply to him though it applies to all of us cuz you know you could you could you you just in the gospel a minister stand by in the pull pit you want to take a gospel paddle sometimes and why don't you move why don't you do something but there's that scripture laying here that no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me drawing now that's what happened with that that uh uh you know Billy Paul started come back to church and the Deacon come up and trapping him on the shoulder and or and and see we it don't don't work that way it's not by force it's not by compelling no matter how much you want to take somebody by the lapel and drag them to the altar it just won't work that way but and and aren't you glad it doesn't work that way because because because that what Paul is saying here he that glortho in the Lord in other words there's nothing that I did and nothing you did all all brother brandom says that we do is we preach the gospel and we cast the net and then God can go to work and begin to drawing and wooing at somebody's heart now that's when you see your calling that you didn't give your heart to the Lord because you were afraid your Mom and Daddy got you afraid and and and all these kind of things but because it was a real genuine calling that God got to work it on your heart and Pull and draw drew you to himself now see it's a call though is not something that you can initiate because we're in this sinful state that we're living in back there you know when Adam first did the thing that he did and and uh you know they they uh got one word off and so forth we know the story and and he he got got his fig leaves and went hiding behind the bushes and here comes God calling for him Adam Where Art Thou now that's the same thing I I forget what sermon it is but brother R lays out that that's actually what the father is still calling Adam Where Art Thou he's doing it through through the ministry through the preaching of the Gospel that when you come to church he's crying out for you and you're sitting there hiding behind your fig leaves and all the things that you're trying to do to twerk up but but but it's God actually drawing you a calling for you and and and then if we'll respond then we can see our calling God called you look at like Cain and Abel isn't it interesting that God called and laid out the path for both of them just like he laid out the path path for Jacob and Esau but only one was able to recognize the calling and respond you you think God laid out to Esau right just laid it out why don't you do like your brother or or to to to Cain why don't you do like your brother and and and just bring uh but but only Abel was able to actually listen and heed and hear by our Revelation right God called but only one had a calling in both of their lives now brother R said in the infallibility of God's spoken word he said man in his nature is a Castaway he's an alien he's away from God then God by Grace has to draw him to his own side all that the father has given me will come to me no way at all there ain't enough picture shows enough dance halls enough burlesque shows in the country to keep you away from God when God goes to draw back Yonder before the foundation of the world when he put your name down that you'd come you're coming that's all that's all he said now oh you might be a hypocrite and work up and say this that or the other but I mean when God calls now now look think back in your own life I I I sure do remember when God called me it wasn't just some kind of education or theology or something but it was something Supernatural that began to pull in my heart right and you recognize when it when it's when it's different you ain't just going to school and sitting there watching somebody draw on a chalkboard or something but it's something real Supernatural begins to tug and pull at your heart I I I remember sitting there in church one time watching this young man it seemed like just a we were in Columbia South Carolina when I was a young boy and I remember it just seemed like just kind of a boring service and everybody you know you had sleepy people in there but then from the back this young man come up and he was just tears falling down his face and and he it seemed like the preacher wasn't preaching any kind of a special sermon he was just laying out some things and and people on the front robow tired and sleepy but that God was moving in that person's heart and see that's that's the difference that when God begins to call and pull at somebody's heart something is going to happen and it ain't CA mama or daddy did something or it ain't cause you know maybe the preacher said something special but God is the one that does the drawing now see that's the thing that makes the difference is God God does the calling and the Seal of Christ he said some people come to church just for the emotional part some people come to church just to sing some people come in church just to enjoy the good singing That's All Right some people come to church and join church just to hide their meanness make themselves a little better name in the neighborhood some come to church sincerely but don't ever have a touch from God but when God calls a man no man can come come to me except my father draws him first and all that comes I will give him everlasting life raise him up at the last day oh I hope you see it brother it's the work of the Holy Spirit revealing to the individual not upon some emotion not upon something you should do or shouldn't do or this that or the other all those things are all right the moves and works and shouting and dancing and speaking in tongues all those things are all right but the first thing it has to be a spiritual Revelation that God has given the individual that Jesus Christ is the Son of God calling that's right without that brother you're only impersonating only pretending now you think about that how simple that can be you just sitting in church and then God reveals to you that that's God calling you uh that's what Paul's talking about when he says you see your calling Brethren that God can take somebody and pluck them out of the Gentile World out out of that that g that Greek world of wisdom and not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God ha chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty that's why Paul could say in Romans chapter 9: 16 so then it is not of him that willth nor nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth Mercy in other words salvation is a gift it's not something earned or deserved your calling is not something that you did to get it or that something you you Merit or something that you you you feel entitled to but your calling is a gift like we were you know we a few Sundays ago we were doing that little exercise where I had the envelopes and you know I I had some name names written on them I think it was brother Terrence and Louise and and I forget somebody else um and and I I wrote the name down and then you know give it out call you and then give it out and and that's playing out exactly what's happening in church when as the gospel is being preached it's actually giving you it's actually calling what God thought of before the foundation of the world and when you receive it well there you got your calling there you got it there in your hand you got that envelope with your name on it and so that's what Paul is trying to explain to the Corinthians you see your calling Brethren if you got it and you recognize that it ain't some man or your mama or daddy that called you that that you've got something that God give to you that identifies you with his thought from before the foundation of the world now you so that means your calling your calling is not just education which is what Paul gets over to in the next chapter CH he starts talking about I didn't come to you with enticing words and things but I come to you with power the expression the expression of deity reveal through these words that I'm preaching to you what we need brother Randon would say what we need is not education and you know the reason why he said that he's saying these things that might be sound a little bit confusing but he said you know when I went to school we had uh we'd go to the the the math class or you know the algebra would be real difficult to it math was hard for me it it was it was not easy and and youd get in there and you you maybe not really understand what's being said and the the teachers up there writing on the chalkboard and you look over to your right and there's somebody with their head on the desk with slobber coming out of their mouth you know they're just sleeping you look over to the other side and they're snoozing and they're just not getting it cuz it's just it's just education and they're not really they hadn't really got the vision of what it is they're just they're just there and they're looking up at the clock waiting for the Bell to ring now now y'all know y'all know just as well as I we've all been there where we're waiting for the Bell to ring you're sitting up in class I I hope that they're serving my favorite I hope I hope they're serving that good School lunchroom pizza today or whatever and you're waiting on the bail to ring now now the same thing happens in church though it's you come to church and you're not really getting it and and that's in school you fall asleep because you're you're not really enthused about it and here in church you you come to church and you start falling asleep cuz you don't really know what's being explained and you're not really you're not really you you it's just a bunch of symbols and algebra and things and maybe like in school the drool will be coming out of somebody's mouth next to you or here in church the same similar kind kind of thing can be happening but and and it all becomes just education it's just you're sitting there and you're waiting for the bail to ring and that's why brother Ram said what we need is not education we need the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost back in the church to demonstrate the power Jesus never said go into all the world and teach he never said go into all the he said go into all the world and preach the gospel and the gospel is to demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost the resurrection now you see when he says that it can be confusing because he's not saying we don't need teaching he's saying we don't need education he's saying we need we need inspired preaching of the Gospel to actually demonstrate it and make it real because that is how you'll see your calling that you're just not educated into it it's not just something where you gather to watch the to wait for the Bell to ring but it's a actually a supernatural calling where God is dealing with hearts and drawing people to himself now brother he would say in Israel and the church in 1953 he said every one of you that held your hand you've been listening in these meetings no one in here could come to Jesus except God God draws him what's doing that what's making that desire God is here God is here now that that's why Paul would say in that next chapter chapter two that I come not to you with enticing words but in the power and administration because the atmosphere of a holy ghost filled church service will bring to people's awareness that God is there and he said what's doing it what's making that desire God begins to draw and begins to pull at the people in the authority of the word he said you can only preach the gospel and let those who will come and no man can come unless God draws him so it all belongs to God and if God has called you and give you a call to come to him you should be very very happy why should you be happy cuz there's that promise in Matthew Chapter 5 that said blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled if you got a desire in your heart and I we I say this because I feel like this in this hour that we're living in it's creeping up on the church World until people just don't really care anymore you can actually see well years ago uh you know when the Lord was dealing with me it seems like everybody the the Lord was dealing with everybody but but now it's gotten to where people have just grown wax colder and colder until they just they're not really hungering or thirsting they there and so that's why Jesus actually said you're blessed you're blessed to to want it you're blessed to to something you know I remember sitting in church and and just want wanting so bad to know for sure whether where I was right positionally and just have that hunger and craving to to to to know if things were right in my life and so you you know back then you you look at you think well there's something wrong with me but actually there's something right there's something right if you if you want God so much until you're ready to pray all night until you're ready to get get alone with god with your Bible there's something right with you if you want God so bad you're willing to do anything to get it and there's something wrong if we've gotten so cold and so far away until church just becomes an education thing where we're just watching for the clock to be filled but the thing is we can't make you be different I can't I can't make myself be different it's got to be God that can move on the scene and call and draw and all we do like this quote that I'm just reading here that you can only preach the gospel and let those who will come now you you think about what a what an amazing thing that is that you preach the gospel and then God goes to work and you can't give the ministry any credit you can't give your yourself any credit you can't give your mama and your daddy any credit can't give the deacons any credit it's all God that's what that's what that's what Paul is telling us that no flesh can Glory because it's all God you can't call yourself you can't draw yourself you can't give yourself a gift it's all God but when the gospel goes to be preaching and the power and and demonstration it will it will do what it says it will do brother R will say you can't come there is no need of trying to do anything unless God draws you when God draws you then you'll come and he that comes to me I will know in no wise cast out now now that's powerful right there that when you start feeling that pulsating in your heart and you know that it's God calling you he promised that I will not cast you out if it's God pulling you and it ain't just the minister trying to scare you or something but it's God actually drawing you he ain't going to cast you out amen he said God has to do it it takes the work of the Holy Spirit to even turn your heart takes God someone said I sought God and sought God no no no God sought you not you seeking God God seeks you just like he sought Adam the very first one he sought Adam Where Art Thou he's still seeking people so salvation is not something Humanity achieves or initiates independently it begins with God's call drawing individuals to himself and the call is a desire to be saved that demonstrates that God is already at work in that individual's heart it's that little pulsating down in your heart that says I I need something God begins to work and begins to move in 2 Timothy chapter 1 ver9 and we'll be closing here in just a second Paul said Paul told Timothy who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began so he's laying out it's not by your own works but there's a purpose it's his grace to us and it was all planned out before the world even began and that's where your calling starts now that's why that's such a powerful statement you see your calling Brethren if you really see your calling that you know what God has given you was the same thing that he thought of before the foundation of the world in Isaiah 46 remember the former things of old for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and I will do my I will do all my pleasure that the word you hear the calling is actually bringing you back to what was yours to begin with but the call and we'll close on this in just a moment is without force or coercion and Jehovah Gyra brother Bram said you believe that the Holy Spirit through this week has proved that he speaks here he asked everybody raise our hands he said there should be this many more or more I feel that feeling there's something wrong yet better come and he said remember I can't force you to come against your own will it's not by force or coercion but it's by that gospel call and glorify Jesus he said you can't desire that God has to make it come to you just think someone setting the holy spirit says this is your time to put up your hand and then you would reject it see that's the Holy Spirit Jesus said no man can come to me unless the father draws him at all what is drawing knocking at your door saying this is it this is it raise your hand now and say oh to think about what a profound thing that God could be knock knocking at somebody's heart to identify with them the present tense word for the day knocking at their heart saying this is it and that's the sign of this end time that in this day the leot Ayan church that God will be put out of the of the church knocking on the door on the outside and and and and and nobody hardly barely anybody will open the door as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot and so forth so few would actually open up that door till even Jesus would ask that question will I find faith when the son of man returns and we'll just stop there let's bow our heads Lord God we're so grateful Lord that you you've given what the world calls foolish and and just simplistic things Lord to save our simple Humble Hearts and change us Lord to make us conform to the word and I I thank you Lord God that you've given us the ability to be able to see our calling and recognize that we're you've made us different from the world you've set us apart Lord God and we know where we come from and where we're going Lord Jesus I pray God that you'll just Lord we we've got so many things to be thankful for Lord God and I pray Lord that you'll be with us for the remainder of the day the remainder of this service Lord Jesus just bless your people keep us now we pray in your name amen God bless you Saints [Applause] [Music]
