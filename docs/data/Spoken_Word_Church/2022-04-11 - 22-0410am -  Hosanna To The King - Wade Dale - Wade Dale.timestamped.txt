[31:10] go up there and fellowship with them and
[31:12] i want to tell you something about
[31:14] you know how i feel about them and
[31:15] they're
[31:16] they're online watching now but uh
[31:18] um they had a uh wedding ceremony
[31:20] yesterday uh a couple got married there
[31:23] so we we pray
[31:25] just keep them in your prayer
[31:27] but you got a group of people that
[31:29] sometimes we
[31:31] sometimes we get settled in our ways and
[31:34] i know we got company here today but
[31:36] we're all family
[31:39] but we get settled in our ways and we
[31:41] think oh it's just brother so-and-so and
[31:42] brother sister and so our sister
[31:44] so-and-so
[31:46] but when you take a group of people
[31:47] that's made a
[31:49] choice
[31:53] bring that baby in here
[31:55] this rebecca good to see you
[31:58] that's her baby
[32:04] hey buddy
[32:06] yeah your seat's up here come on
[32:09] good to see you
[32:11] good to have you good to be here hey man
[32:14] there's a story behind that but i'll let
[32:15] her tell you that later on
[32:17] so the youth service we're going to try
[32:18] to have the reason i have a place in my
[32:21] heart for these people know how
[32:23] is
[32:24] they left
[32:25] a real comfortable place
[32:28] they left a church that was comfortable
[32:30] kind of like ours you got family and we
[32:32] had these
[32:33] we have these youth functions and we
[32:35] have all these eating things you can
[32:37] tell we're all kind of big
[32:39] but
[32:40] you know we have a church family and
[32:41] they
[32:42] they decided after listening not not
[32:44] just listening to us but listening to
[32:46] the ministry of this church
[32:48] they decided
[32:50] to leave
[32:51] where they were
[32:53] and they're 11 hours away so there's no
[32:56] way they can commute
[32:59] so they decided to just make the little
[33:01] church and you saw most of you saw that
[33:02] where we dedicated it a couple of weeks
[33:04] ago
[33:06] and listen if somebody's going to make
[33:08] an effort like that we ought to make an
[33:10] effort to make sure that it works
[33:13] we ought to we ought to nurture them we
[33:14] ought to i mean you know they're like i
[33:16] told them before the the wound is still
[33:18] raw
[33:20] but wounds wounds heal they scab over
[33:22] and you know sometimes you whack them
[33:24] again and they hurt again but i want us
[33:26] to
[33:26] to uh
[33:28] um welcome them with open arms and and
[33:31] uh
[33:32] they love the lord they love brother
[33:34] dale they love our ministry here at the
[33:35] church
[33:36] and we love them
[33:38] so i want us to make sure that that that
[33:41] that we stay connected with them and we
[33:43] help them as much as we can because
[33:45] they're up there
[33:46] um
[33:48] sitting now in a basement pretty little
[33:49] church
[33:50] but there's churches all around there
[33:52] that they could be going to
[33:54] and they chose not to do it because they
[33:57] like brother dale or may or brother bob
[33:59] or brother luis or brother aaron they
[34:01] like the word of god that's coming forth
[34:03] from this building amen
[34:05] they enjoy listening
[34:08] like i said before they they're you know
[34:10] like their dad brother uh enrique or
[34:13] richard
[34:14] he tells me he tells us things that we
[34:16] did you know
[34:18] 15 years ago that we've already forgot
[34:20] but they listened to our sermons
[34:23] religiously so
[34:25] they just have a place
[34:28] in our heart
[34:29] and we want to support them so on july
[34:31] the 16th if we have to fly or drive
[34:33] we're going to try to go up there and
[34:35] have a youth service
[34:37] and then we've uh they rented a venue
[34:39] where we can have about 40 or 50 people
[34:41] in it and we'll have a church service
[34:43] there on sunday so just keep in prayer
[34:45] that's a long time i mean that's july
[34:47] 16th
[34:48] um
[34:49] coming up we'll talk about that
[34:52] a little bit more uh brother joe and
[34:54] brother direct them they're on vacation
[34:55] good to have anna and all the different
[34:56] ones that we're gone got to have y'all
[34:58] back
[34:59] and good to be in the house of the lord
[35:00] so let's read let's turn to matthew
[35:03] today we're going to shift gears a
[35:04] little bit
[35:05] we're still going to be talking a little
[35:07] about the son of man
[35:08] but we want to
[35:10] today how many know today's palm sunday
[35:14] today's palm sunday that is the that is
[35:16] the starting of the holy week
[35:19] for christians heading up to easter this
[35:22] is today that jesus did something that
[35:24] he had never done before
[35:27] now he'd entered the temple many times
[35:30] but he was coming in a different way
[35:33] he was coming in with a position and
[35:35] some authority
[35:36] he was coming in to do a job
[35:39] the king was coming
[35:41] to fight a battle
[35:43] he was coming to fight for me and you
[35:46] this whole week he fought
[35:48] he fought satan in the garden he fought
[35:50] him in on the cross just for me and you
[35:52] so we don't have to fight him anymore
[35:54] amen so we're gonna talk a little bit
[35:58] the title today will be hosanna
[36:01] to the king
[36:02] amen
[36:04] matthew 21
[36:07] verse 8
[36:08] let's pray lord thank you for this day
[36:10] thank you for the things you give us
[36:12] thank you for giving us an opportunity
[36:13] to even be standing here lord talking to
[36:15] the purchased possession of your blood
[36:17] lord i pray that you just sanctify us
[36:19] for this journey lord thank you for
[36:20] giving brother bob
[36:22] the liberty this morning to speak father
[36:24] in the song service and the baby
[36:26] dedication and
[36:27] and our friends are there are here with
[36:29] us lord may may they see christ
[36:32] in all of us lord
[36:34] and as we speak about you lord you take
[36:36] over and you do the speaking father
[36:38] because without you here lord it would
[36:39] be just a meeting of of people lord but
[36:43] with you lord here there something will
[36:44] happen lives will be changed
[36:47] lord you've come this time of the year
[36:49] we
[36:50] we surely have a resurrection when every
[36:52] day if you're a christian but there's a
[36:54] time of of a week that you physically
[36:56] came on this earth
[36:58] and you died on a cross for us at
[37:00] calvary
[37:01] and we know that father because you rose
[37:03] from the dead and you live now in the
[37:05] hearts of the people
[37:06] so lord maybe may we respond today to
[37:09] that part that's inside of us lord
[37:11] and to respond back and say that ain't
[37:13] nothing but the truth and hosanna to the
[37:16] king
[37:17] lord just bless us and be with us in
[37:18] jesus name we pray
[37:20] amen let's read the scripture i know
[37:22] i've kept you standing too long but it
[37:23] keeps you from going to sleep matthew 21
[37:26] verse 8 says a very great multitude
[37:29] spread their garments in the way and
[37:31] i'll tell you why there was a bunch of
[37:32] people there a little while others cut
[37:34] down branches from the trees that's why
[37:36] they call this
[37:38] palm sunday all right
[37:40] and there's a significance of that too
[37:42] branches from the trees and straw them
[37:44] in the way in other words they laid them
[37:46] down
[37:48] and the multitudes that went before and
[37:50] that followed cried saying hosanna to
[37:52] the son of david
[37:53] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[37:55] the lord
[37:56] hosanna in the highest and when he was
[37:58] coming to jerusalem
[37:59] all the city
[38:02] wow
[38:03] all the city was moved now there was two
[38:06] groups that were moving and we'll talk
[38:07] about that in a minute there always is
[38:08] two groups but three groups brother
[38:10] brown says mate believer unbeliever true
[38:11] believer
[38:12] and when he was coming to jerusalem all
[38:14] the city was moved saying
[38:16] who is this he may be seated in the lord
[38:18] and his blessing to the reading of the
[38:20] word what have we been speaking on who
[38:22] is this
[38:23] son of man
[38:24] who is this person that's come
[38:27] that before the foundation of the world
[38:30] he was god almighty he was a creator
[38:34] he was the one that could roll galaxies
[38:36] off of his finger
[38:38] he was the one that said let there be
[38:39] light and let there be this whole world
[38:41] that we stand on
[38:43] there was that man
[38:45] now he's standing today in a group of
[38:47] people but he had to go to calvary
[38:50] he had to begin this week
[38:53] remember he rode into jerusalem
[38:56] on a donkey
[38:58] he rode into jerusalem
[39:01] on palm sunday
[39:03] and seven days later
[39:06] he rose in that same city
[39:09] and he didn't need a donkey
[39:12] he walked wherever he needed to go he
[39:14] traveled like a thought
[39:16] because he resurrected in a glorified
[39:17] condition
[39:18] he said all power in heaven and earth
[39:20] being given unto me
[39:22] amen
[39:25] we love the resurrection but let's
[39:27] continue on and look let's look in the
[39:29] hebrew lexicon about what this word
[39:31] hosanna means
[39:34] the word hosanna means
[39:36] to save
[39:37] to be saved to be delivered that what
[39:39] were they saying
[39:40] hosanna save me
[39:43] save me we need a savior
[39:47] to be liberated how many wants to be
[39:49] liberated today listen i'm gonna preach
[39:50] today we're not gonna do any teaching so
[39:52] you can say amen or hallelujah clap or
[39:54] whatever you want to do not loud i don't
[39:56] care do something
[39:57] be liberated be saved be delivered
[40:01] we all need deliverance today
[40:03] there's things in our life that we all
[40:04] need deliverance from amen and like
[40:06] brother bob said it's just it's a daily
[40:08] hacking away of the of the skin of the
[40:11] world and you say i can't do this no you
[40:14] can't right
[40:16] let him do it that's right he's the one
[40:18] who did all the work
[40:19] like brother bob said we need to what
[40:21] rest problem is we fight right
[40:24] that's right
[40:26] the problem is we fight he says rest
[40:29] we say no we got well
[40:32] what is our problem we
[40:35] we beat the problem if that is a that is
[40:37] a statement we be the problem
[40:39] and that's the problem we have now look
[40:41] but to be saved look in battle
[40:45] be victorious jesus was not he didn't
[40:48] just walk
[40:49] up to jerusalem to the gates and say i
[40:52] don't want to do this anymore it's too
[40:53] hard
[40:54] i don't want to come to church it's too
[40:56] hard
[40:57] i don't want to wear the right clothes
[40:59] it's too hard
[41:00] i don't want to say glory hallelujah and
[41:02] pray it's too hard no he didn't he said
[41:05] i'll come to take over
[41:07] i've come he said and what he said go
[41:10] find me a donkey and i'm gonna say
[41:11] donkey like brother
[41:13] brother uh who was that brother
[41:16] marcus becker he you don't use the word
[41:18] ass the whole time you know but the
[41:20] bible does say that
[41:21] but we're gonna say donkey
[41:24] but there's a significance about this
[41:25] donkey
[41:26] and the way he rode into jerusalem and i
[41:28] about
[41:29] had a religious fit when i saw
[41:32] anybody ever know what foal means
[41:35] we've read it a thousand two thousand
[41:37] times if you've read your bible he come
[41:38] in on the fall of a donkey
[41:42] we'll talk about that in just a second
[41:44] but he wrote in on sunday and he he rode
[41:47] in triumphant he wrote in and said i'm
[41:49] here
[41:51] he didn't shun the job he did the job he
[41:53] was supposed to do
[41:55] and he was headed toward calvary he knew
[41:57] there was something coming he knew he
[41:59] was going to die
[42:00] he knew that was the last trip
[42:04] he knew that was the last trip that he
[42:06] was ever going to go through those gates
[42:08] alive
[42:10] because he's going to die for me and you
[42:12] he didn't die for himself
[42:14] he died for us
[42:17] and we look at the crucifixion was on
[42:19] friday
[42:20] he was only just a few days away from
[42:22] that
[42:23] yes and remember we're going to read
[42:25] here in zechariah 9
[42:27] just keep that in mind though to be
[42:29] saved in battle
[42:30] to be saved right now he came to fight a
[42:33] battle
[42:34] but zechariah had already talked about
[42:36] it in the old testament rejoice greatly
[42:39] o daughter of zion now who is the
[42:41] daughter of zion
[42:43] the bride of jesus christ
[42:45] that's us today if that's all right
[42:47] oh daughter of zion of jerusalem behold
[42:50] thy king cometh amen
[42:54] declaring king today
[42:57] if you're declaring king all those other
[42:59] things that go out of your life
[43:01] you declare him to be the king that's
[43:03] right
[43:04] sure we all have issues but listen we
[43:06] can't dwell in the past
[43:08] three unclean spirits like frogs look
[43:10] backwards yeah all right that's right we
[43:13] don't want to look backwards
[43:15] you know what it is is you're not
[43:17] believing that god can do what he said
[43:18] he would do
[43:22] we throw it in the sea of god's
[43:23] forgetfulness he throws it in there then
[43:26] we go fishing
[43:31] stay out of that water
[43:34] it's a sea of forgetfulness
[43:36] don't go digging
[43:37] don't go fishing
[43:39] don't go throwing a nap back out there
[43:41] and see what you can pull back in
[43:43] i have to believe standing here today in
[43:45] this pulpit i've done things in my life
[43:48] that's totally unworthy that i shouldn't
[43:49] be right here today
[43:54] but god
[43:56] has cleaned me up
[43:58] if god cleans you up
[44:00] if god will clean you up
[44:03] then yes sir you can do now there's
[44:05] things that you can't do there's things
[44:06] that that we have we know that there's
[44:08] grace but we know it's not greasy grace
[44:11] we know we have to come to a process of
[44:13] justified sanctified filled with the
[44:15] holy ghost we'll talk about that more
[44:16] this afternoon brother bob hit it this
[44:18] morning which is wonderful that we don't
[44:21] talk to each other but we preached
[44:23] basically the same thing you know
[44:25] and we come together
[44:27] and on sunday and let god talk to us
[44:30] regardless of whether he was sitting and
[44:32] coming last night getting his message
[44:33] and i was sitting in gillsville getting
[44:35] mine god was still there doing something
[44:37] amen so we must believe that and that's
[44:39] what i have to put my belief in that god
[44:41] cleaned me up
[44:43] that god gave me the holy ghost and if
[44:45] he didn't give me the holy ghost i want
[44:47] it so bad
[44:49] till i don't want to do nothing else but
[44:51] have it amen
[44:53] but he promised he'd give it to us we've
[44:55] been talking about promises
[44:57] so here's this man he's he's not coming
[44:59] up to the to the city and
[45:01] and being a prophet being god almighty
[45:03] and human flesh he knew what he was
[45:05] heading toward but he didn't shun his
[45:07] responsibility
[45:09] he died for those people that said
[45:10] hosanna
[45:12] save us
[45:14] we need salvation
[45:16] thou son of david
[45:20] behold thy king cometh unto thee he is
[45:22] just
[45:23] and having salvation
[45:26] lowly and riding upon a donkey
[45:28] and upon a cult the foal of a donkey now
[45:32] we're gonna pick this apart a little bit
[45:34] it looks like he's riding on two donkeys
[45:36] but he's not
[45:38] he's riding on
[45:40] the little donkey
[45:44] he can't ride in on his mama's coattail
[45:49] he's riding on the sun
[45:53] hmm
[45:55] rejoice oh oh daughter of
[45:58] zion he's going to ride upon a donkey
[46:01] and we will see we'll read what jesus
[46:03] told him to do upon a cult the foal of a
[46:05] donkey
[46:08] remember he was a burden bearer
[46:11] remember he was a type of the scapegoat
[46:15] you had one goat that was sacrificed and
[46:17] one goat that the scent the what the the
[46:18] blood was put on that scapegoat and was
[46:21] sent out into the desert
[46:22] that's what i'm saying that's our
[46:24] problem we don't believe that our sins
[46:26] got took away
[46:28] our problem is we go hunting that goat
[46:32] where are you supposed to not hunt the
[46:33] goat
[46:34] leave the goat alone leave your sins
[46:36] alone
[46:39] i mean come on people good grief we got
[46:41] to get over ourselves first
[46:45] i was reading well i was listening
[46:47] something the other day where brother
[46:48] brown was talking about it said
[46:50] so brother brown said that demon came
[46:52] back on her and you know what he said he
[46:53] said it did because she loved it
[46:59] legion hated his demons
[47:03] and god cast them out
[47:06] and they didn't come back according to
[47:07] the bible
[47:08] he was in his sound mind
[47:11] that's our problem our problem is is we
[47:13] like them
[47:17] can i talk a little bit today
[47:20] you say no brother i hate them they
[47:22] torment me no you don't hate them enough
[47:26] and listen we all got them
[47:28] listen there's no itty bitty demons and
[47:30] no biggie biggie demons
[47:32] it's all unbelief yeah i said biggie
[47:35] biggie
[47:36] it's all unbelief
[47:38] it's all what you can believe that god
[47:40] has done for you not that god sent a
[47:43] prophet in the end time we're not even
[47:44] going to talk about the message today
[47:46] we're talking about what god did for us
[47:48] so this is a holy week not a holy week
[47:50] for a seventh angel messenger
[47:54] he wasn't god
[47:56] god's want to save my soul
[47:59] but god had to send us a prophet amen
[48:01] god had to send us a prophet because we
[48:04] were so confused we were like that mixed
[48:06] multitude some of them threw down the
[48:08] palms some of them threw down their
[48:10] their jackets and said hosanna to the
[48:13] king but where were they at the
[48:14] crucifixion where were they at the
[48:16] judgment hall
[48:18] there were some that believed
[48:20] maybe secret believers they said about
[48:22] you know nicodemus and the different
[48:23] ones
[48:24] but there was some people that the bible
[48:26] tells us that
[48:28] even the disciples didn't understand
[48:29] what was going on until after god had
[48:31] come back in
[48:32] in uh the baptism of the holy ghost and
[48:34] entered into those
[48:36] into those men because you know what
[48:38] they were there when jesus rode in and
[48:40] they ran away from him too
[48:43] so let's go to matthew 21 verse one now
[48:46] let's read the story
[48:50] kind of shift gears a little bit today
[48:53] and when they drew nine to jerusalem
[48:56] it would come to beth page
[48:58] until the mount of olives then sent
[48:59] jesus to disciples saying unto them go
[49:01] into the village
[49:03] over against you and straightway you
[49:04] shall find a donkey tide
[49:06] and a cult with her that was her child
[49:10] that was the son
[49:13] loose them
[49:15] and bring them unto me
[49:17] and if any man say all unto you you
[49:19] shall say the lord hath need of them
[49:20] straightway he will send them
[49:22] and all this was done that it might be
[49:24] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[49:26] prophet we just read it in jeremiah
[49:28] tell ye the daughter of zion behold thy
[49:31] king cometh unto thee meek and sitting
[49:33] upon a donkey in a cult the fall
[49:38] of a donkey
[49:40] you know what that word fall means
[49:42] look at it
[49:44] son of man
[49:49] his son son of david all of them all the
[49:52] names turn a man son of god son of david
[49:54] my beloved son why it was the son of a
[49:57] mother donkey
[50:00] everybody with me
[50:03] he was identifying who he was yes
[50:06] he was the son of man
[50:08] he was the one riding in i never knew
[50:10] what that word fold mean meant
[50:12] it's f-o-a-l foal the fall
[50:16] of a donkey which means the son of man i
[50:18] want to read the rest of it i don't know
[50:19] what just happened but we need that back
[50:21] up there
[50:24] because i want you to listen to what
[50:26] man okey-dokey go all the way down to 1a
[50:29] this is coming from this is coming from
[50:31] strong to quarters i want you to read
[50:32] this
[50:33] rarely used for the young of animals
[50:36] so it wasn't even supposed to be used
[50:40] to identify a young donkey
[50:44] generally of the offspring of men
[50:47] and in a restricted sense the male
[50:49] offspring one born of look born by a
[50:53] father and of a mother
[50:56] i said exactly the way it's supposed to
[50:58] be
[51:00] one born by a father
[51:03] and of a mother amen amen
[51:07] term describing man carrying the
[51:09] connotation of weakness and mortality i
[51:12] want you to watch this one right here
[51:14] number three used by christ himself
[51:17] they talk about son of man talk about
[51:18] the son of man all right
[51:20] doubtless in order that he might
[51:22] intimate his messiahship and also that
[51:24] he might designate himself
[51:26] as the head of the human race
[51:29] the king in other words the man he was
[51:31] riding into
[51:32] jerusalem
[51:34] identifying himself as the flesh king
[51:37] [Music]
[51:38] oh jehovah had been king
[51:40] jehovah had been god in the old
[51:42] testament but all they saw was a cloud
[51:44] all they saw was smoke all they saw was
[51:46] every once in a while a light would go
[51:48] across or they they knew that the
[51:51] preacher would go back behind the holy
[51:52] of holies and he would do what he's
[51:54] supposed to do and the shekinah glory
[51:56] would fall but he would only fell on one
[51:58] person god's fixing to walk through this
[52:00] place that would call jerusalem through
[52:01] that arch and say here i am yes amen
[52:04] i'm riding on the very thing that i am
[52:08] amen
[52:09] i am the son of man and i'm riding on
[52:11] the fall
[52:12] man that's right
[52:14] continue
[52:16] yeah i thought he's pretty good too
[52:19] and he also might designate himself as
[52:21] the head of the human race the man
[52:23] look the one
[52:25] who both furnished the pattern of the
[52:28] per
[52:29] you can't make that stuff up
[52:33] the one who furnished the pattern of the
[52:35] perfect man
[52:39] and acted on behalf of all mankind
[52:43] amen he died for every person but he
[52:45] knew only a certain group would take him
[52:48] christ seemed to have to prefer
[52:50] preferred this to the other masonic
[52:52] titles remember son of god son of david
[52:54] they called him all different things no
[52:56] he was the son of man
[52:58] he was god in human flesh
[53:00] christ seems to have preferred this to
[53:02] other messiah titles because by its
[53:04] loneliness it was at least suited to
[53:06] foster the expectation of an earthly
[53:09] messiah
[53:11] in royal
[53:12] splendor
[53:14] that was god
[53:15] in human flesh
[53:17] that went into that city
[53:19] let's continue and the disciples went
[53:21] and did as jesus commanded them and
[53:23] brought the cult or brought them the
[53:25] mama and the cult that's that's what the
[53:27] scripture's saying
[53:28] and putting on them their clothes and
[53:30] they set him their own now it's not
[53:32] clear which one they set him on but john
[53:34] will tell you exactly they set him on
[53:35] the little one because he was the son of
[53:37] man and that was the son of that of that
[53:40] donkey
[53:41] and a very great multitude spread their
[53:43] garb where was those multitudes at on
[53:45] crucifixion day
[53:47] where was that crowd on resurrection
[53:49] morning
[53:50] where was that crowd that was at
[53:52] judgment hall
[53:54] that happened happens a lot everything
[53:56] you know we get this zeal and we get
[53:57] this new feeling and we get this new i
[53:59] like brother branham talks about him um
[54:01] talks about sanctification everybody
[54:03] thinks in sanctification man i got the
[54:04] holy ghost because i feel this
[54:06] i've quit doing this i've quit doing no
[54:08] that you just had the unclean spirit
[54:10] tore out of you
[54:13] but remember there's the door still open
[54:16] amen
[54:17] the house it left
[54:19] the door's still there
[54:21] and if you don't close it by the baptism
[54:23] of the holy ghost satan will come back
[54:25] into the house
[54:27] and he will bring seven demons
[54:29] more wicked than him more religious than
[54:31] he is
[54:33] and he'll set you in church and say
[54:35] i don't do this and i don't do that
[54:37] right so i must be right
[54:41] some brother bob was talking about huh
[54:44] it's got to be a love affair
[54:47] no do's and don'ts
[54:49] people think we're weird no i we're
[54:52] going to cover something a little bit
[54:53] this afternoon we
[54:54] we've got to be separated from the world
[54:56] folks
[54:58] the world has got to be able to tell we
[55:01] are different
[55:03] because this man right here this son of
[55:05] man was he normal
[55:08] was he just
[55:10] well i'm part of this crowd and i'm part
[55:12] of the pharisees and i love you
[55:14] sadducees i love you pharisees we got
[55:16] the same father we come from the same
[55:19] place no he never told him that he said
[55:21] you come from one place and i come from
[55:23] another you came from the devil because
[55:25] that's your daddy and my daddy's from
[55:26] above
[55:27] he separated himself remember i told you
[55:30] sure he is the prince of peace
[55:32] the mighty god the everlasting father
[55:34] but he stood up one day and said i come
[55:36] to bring a sword yes i come to divide
[55:38] families up
[55:39] because if you don't accept jesus christ
[55:41] as your savior i don't care if my kids
[55:44] don't do that they're separated from me
[55:48] but we're claiming our kids we know that
[55:51] listen we don't draw anybody out
[55:53] it's your free will choice
[55:55] to decide if you want jesus christ to be
[55:57] in your life or not
[55:59] amen
[56:00] i was thinking yesterday
[56:02] just for a minute
[56:05] you know when we were
[56:07] 14 15 16 maybe even 20 years old
[56:10] did you think about dying
[56:14] you had a thousand years to live
[56:17] thousands of years you had to live
[56:20] neither don't smile
[56:22] you could just
[56:23] i mean man end of life don't talk to me
[56:26] about that
[56:30] you get 62.
[56:34] and 80.
[56:37] you know if if even if time goes on you
[56:39] ain't got but about five or six good
[56:40] years if you get up in that
[56:42] region everybody with me i'm 62. in 20
[56:45] years i'll be 82. that ain't nothing
[56:48] right right
[56:49] so you start thinking about it later on
[56:51] in your life things that didn't bother
[56:52] you back there it bothers you now
[56:55] thinking about your humanity well what
[56:57] are you saying brother wade get born
[56:59] again tomorrow may not come
[57:01] you get right with god now tomorrow may
[57:03] not come
[57:05] and then what are you going to do then
[57:06] god's going to say i'll give you an
[57:08] opportunity
[57:09] amen
[57:11] let's get back to this king
[57:14] everybody all right
[57:15] amen you love the lord
[57:19] it's an exciting time
[57:21] sure it's horrible for the world it's
[57:23] but it's exciting time for us i you know
[57:25] i don't i don't worry about stock market
[57:27] i don't worry about
[57:29] i don't worry about you know the
[57:30] the
[57:31] interest rates going up and all that
[57:33] stuff
[57:34] why what are you going to be able to do
[57:36] about it
[57:37] but god's give you give you provision to
[57:40] make it through
[57:42] he didn't say remember like i was
[57:44] telling you last sunday everybody thinks
[57:45] boy once you become a preacher
[57:48] once you become a preacher your grass
[57:50] quits growing
[57:54] never have to cut it
[57:56] and when you become a preacher your
[57:58] bills stop coming in
[58:00] huh
[58:01] people brings you food and you just
[58:02] don't ever have to go buy food
[58:05] you're just so in love with you your
[58:07] wife you and your wife never have an
[58:09] issue
[58:11] all that just goes away
[58:13] no
[58:14] all that just begins
[58:17] y'all ever remember playing dog pile
[58:22] of you don't you kids are going is that
[58:23] a video game
[58:25] no it's not a video game it's reality
[58:28] it was called dog pile and you piled up
[58:30] on top of somebody thank god aaron
[58:32] wasn't my friend
[58:36] just saying
[58:38] but we used to play dog pile that's what
[58:39] happens when you stick your hand up and
[58:41] you say i'm a christian
[58:43] satan
[58:44] brings his dog pile friends with him and
[58:47] they dog pay you but you know what
[58:48] there's one greater than him this guy
[58:50] right here that walked through those
[58:51] streets of jerusalem he said i have come
[58:54] to take over you might think this is my
[58:56] worst hour
[58:58] you might think world that you're
[58:59] killing me
[59:01] you might think world that i've lost all
[59:03] my friends know i'm fixing to make a lot
[59:05] more
[59:06] i'm fixing to have some children
[59:09] i'm fixing to have somebody that loves
[59:11] me so much so they're going to give up
[59:13] their own life
[59:14] [Music]
[59:16] to have me i love you everybody all
[59:18] right
[59:19] he never said a word when he walked in
[59:21] jerusalem
[59:22] he didn't have to
[59:24] there was one crowd shouting hosanna to
[59:26] the king one brother brown many times he
[59:28] said one of them had old um rotten fruit
[59:31] thrown at him you always got the two
[59:33] groups you already got the ones that
[59:34] says man he's coming to save us and then
[59:36] we hate this guy
[59:38] and if you're a true christian the
[59:40] world's gonna say we hate this guy
[59:42] because we're not normal
[59:44] i don't want
[59:52] he brought the
[59:53] donkey and the colt put on the clothes
[59:55] and they sent him their own and a great
[59:56] multitude spread their garments in the
[59:58] way
[59:59] now this is a signification of a king
[1:00:01] coming in
[1:00:03] a king's parade the people would always
[1:00:05] stand outside and they would throw palm
[1:00:07] trees and they would throw whatever
[1:00:09] flowers and their and their cloaks they
[1:00:11] would throw down because in honor of a
[1:00:14] king coming through
[1:00:15] the city that's what they were doing but
[1:00:17] that same crowd
[1:00:19] five days later
[1:00:21] said let his blood be on us and our
[1:00:22] children
[1:00:23] and they hung him on a cross
[1:00:25] and the very great multitudes spread
[1:00:27] their garment in the way others cut down
[1:00:28] branches from the trees and straw them
[1:00:30] in the way and the multitude that went
[1:00:31] before and that followed cried saying
[1:00:33] hosanna to the son of david
[1:00:36] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[1:00:38] the lord hosanna in the highest and when
[1:00:40] he was coming to jerusalem all the city
[1:00:42] was moved saying who is this have you
[1:00:44] ever moved the city
[1:00:48] have you ever moved a room
[1:00:51] you walk into a room and something
[1:00:52] happens
[1:00:54] you walk into the room and somebody says
[1:00:56] something's different showed up
[1:01:00] have you ever
[1:01:02] the whole city was moved because this
[1:01:04] one guy
[1:01:05] and the multitude said this is jesus the
[1:01:08] prophet of nazareth of galilee now that
[1:01:10] was one interpretation
[1:01:12] and jesus went into the temple of god
[1:01:14] now look
[1:01:15] here's the prince of peace
[1:01:18] he walks into the temple
[1:01:20] and he plants a rope
[1:01:23] takes him about 15 or 20 minutes because
[1:01:25] he's sitting there plating it
[1:01:29] he was watching
[1:01:30] he was watching them dishonor the word
[1:01:33] of god in his house

[1:01:36] somebody is he planting a rope this
[1:01:39] morning
[1:01:43] come on that's your choice
[1:01:46] and jesus went into the temple of god
[1:01:48] and cast out all them that sold and
[1:01:50] bought in the temple and overthrew the
[1:01:51] tables he didn't just go in there and
[1:01:53] say look y'all don't need to be doing
[1:01:54] that
[1:01:58] he was cleaning house
[1:02:00] the prince of peace was doing that
[1:02:03] some people they they have a
[1:02:05] bad conception even of us they think man
[1:02:06] we all just let everybody run all over
[1:02:08] us and and you know no
[1:02:10] no
[1:02:11] no no no you stand on the word of god
[1:02:14] because look he's fixing to quote them
[1:02:17] scripture amen
[1:02:19] and he said unto them it is written my
[1:02:20] house shall be called the house of
[1:02:22] prayer but you have made it
[1:02:23] a den of thieves and the blind and the
[1:02:25] lame came to him in the temple and he
[1:02:27] healed them
[1:02:28] verse 15 and when the chief preached now
[1:02:30] see now here's the religious people
[1:02:32] showed up

[1:05:17] daughter of zion behold the king coming
[1:05:19] sitting on a
[1:05:21] donkey's colt
[1:05:23] all right everybody okay with that
[1:05:25] that was the foal
[1:05:27] these things understood not his
[1:05:29] disciples at the first
[1:05:31] didn't know why this man why is he
[1:05:32] calling for a donkey
[1:05:35] not the mother she probably was bigger
[1:05:38] wants the cold
[1:05:40] because they had to be a son
[1:05:42] he had to ride in on on his revelation
[1:05:44] that he was the son
[1:05:45] he was the son of man
[1:05:47] these things understood not his
[1:05:48] disciples at the first but when jesus
[1:05:50] was glorified then remembered they that
[1:05:52] these things were written of him that
[1:05:54] they had done these things unto him the
[1:05:56] people therefore that was with him when
[1:05:58] they called lazarus out of the grave and
[1:06:00] raised him from the dead bare record for
[1:06:02] this cause the people also met him for
[1:06:04] they had heard that he had done this
[1:06:05] miracle
[1:06:07] now the pharisees shows up
[1:06:10] the pharisees therefore said among
[1:06:12] themselves proceed perceive you how you
[1:06:14] prevail nothing behold the world has
[1:06:17] gone after him
[1:06:20] and there were certain greeks among them
[1:06:22] that came to worship at the feast same
[1:06:24] came therefore philip which was a
[1:06:26] bethesda of galilee and desired him
[1:06:27] saying sir
[1:06:28] we would see jesus now we know brother
[1:06:30] brown preached many sermons on that sir
[1:06:33] we would see jesus
[1:06:34] they had heard about him
[1:06:36] they wanted to see him philip cometh and
[1:06:38] tell us andrew and again andrew and
[1:06:40] philip tell jesus now watch i brought
[1:06:42] this part in because look this is what
[1:06:44] jesus is saying
[1:06:47] right after he came into jerusalem
[1:06:49] everybody with me
[1:06:50] all right don't fall asleep on me
[1:06:53] and jesus answered him saying the hours
[1:06:56] come
[1:06:57] i've walked into my arena
[1:07:00] i've walked into my place of fighting
[1:07:04] satan you chose this place
[1:07:07] that's all right
[1:07:10] but i'm gonna die
[1:07:12] on that same hill
[1:07:14] that i created
[1:07:17] the same tree that i created you're
[1:07:19] going to put me on it but that's okay
[1:07:20] i've got a
[1:07:21] job to do
[1:07:24] the hour has come that the son of man
[1:07:25] should be glorified
[1:07:27] verily verily i say unto you except the
[1:07:29] corn of wheat fall in the ground and die
[1:07:30] it abideth alone
[1:07:32] but if it die
[1:07:34] it bringeth forth much fruit
[1:07:38] amen
[1:07:39] i'm going to take a handful of seed
[1:07:40] probably one day next week if it'll ever
[1:07:42] warm up a little bit i'm gonna take a
[1:07:43] little bag full of seed
[1:07:45] i'm gonna plant probably 100 uh corn
[1:07:47] plants and you know what's going to
[1:07:48] happen there's going to be probably a
[1:07:50] million
[1:07:52] other seeds or corn that's going to come
[1:07:54] from that
[1:07:55] because it's going to make a stalk with
[1:07:57] two cobs and there's several hundred on
[1:07:59] each cob out of one seed
[1:08:02] so that's what jesus was saying i gotta
[1:08:04] die so that you can live i gotta die so
[1:08:06] that i can multiply
[1:08:08] even though i am the king even though
[1:08:10] i'm telling you i'm doing everything i'm
[1:08:12] supposed to do you're going to turn me
[1:08:14] down
[1:08:17] he that loveth his life shall lose it
[1:08:19] and he that hateth his life in this
[1:08:20] world shall keep it under what life
[1:08:23] eternal
[1:08:24] if any man serve me let him follow me
[1:08:26] and where i am there shall also my
[1:08:28] servant be
[1:08:30] if any man serve me him will my father
[1:08:33] honor hallelujah
[1:08:36] now is my soul
[1:08:38] troubled
[1:08:41] the very deep part of him
[1:08:43] now is my soul troubled and what shall i
[1:08:45] say father save me from this hour
[1:08:48] because he was a human
[1:08:49] but for this cause came i unto this hour
[1:08:54] father glorify thy name now what's the
[1:08:56] name of the father is father name
[1:08:59] his son or name
[1:09:01] his holy ghost the name
[1:09:04] he said why brother i'm to take matthew
[1:09:06] 28 19 because that's what jesus said
[1:09:09] jesus said exactly what
[1:09:11] acts 2 38 says
[1:09:14] he said be baptized in the name of the
[1:09:16] father and of the son and of the holy
[1:09:18] ghost what's the name of the father
[1:09:23] next week
[1:09:27] boy
[1:09:28] class participation
[1:09:31] but father glorify thy name listen
[1:09:34] jehovah gyra wasn't his name
[1:09:38] nope jehovah wasn't his name
[1:09:40] amen
[1:09:41] god had only one name
[1:09:43] and that's jesus christ
[1:09:45] and he's the lord
[1:09:46] and why did christian baptism why is it
[1:09:49] always in the bible the name of jesus
[1:09:52] christ
[1:09:53] you say well that seems contrary um you
[1:09:55] know we got jesus talking over here and
[1:09:58] we got we got peter talking over here
[1:10:00] well now listen jesus didn't have keys
[1:10:02] that peter did
[1:10:07] because jesus said peter i've given to
[1:10:10] you the keys to the kingdom
[1:10:12] and whatever you bind on earth i'll bind
[1:10:15] in heaven whatever you loose on earth i
[1:10:17] loose in heaven so peter on the day of
[1:10:18] pentecost he had the key
[1:10:22] and he knew the revelation
[1:10:24] that father is not a name son is not a
[1:10:27] name and he always was talking about the
[1:10:29] father having a name
[1:10:31] i come in my father's name
[1:10:34] what's his father's name jesus christ
[1:10:37] so peter says all right repent be
[1:10:39] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:10:40] jesus christ for the remission of your
[1:10:42] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:10:44] the holy ghost
[1:10:46] when we baptize our brother and sister
[1:10:48] next sunday
[1:10:49] it's going to be a killing
[1:10:51] we're going to a funeral
[1:10:54] somebody's going to die
[1:10:56] we're going to put them down in burial
[1:10:58] we're going to bring them up in newness
[1:10:59] of life but we're not going to we're not
[1:11:02] going to put them in that water in a
[1:11:04] dead name
[1:11:06] we're not going to put them in that in
[1:11:08] that grave with titles right
[1:11:11] father's not a name son is not a name
[1:11:13] go silent chad just says i'm a father so
[1:11:16] i'll just sign father
[1:11:17] the bank will call you back
[1:11:20] and say what's your
[1:11:21] name amen
[1:11:24] that's why we baptize the name lord
[1:11:25] jesus christ we don't do it contrary to
[1:11:27] the scripture we do it because the
[1:11:28] scripture tells us to do it
[1:11:30] amen
[1:11:31] it is written it is written that's right
[1:11:33] we're the only one that
[1:11:35] to me that's the only christian baptism
[1:11:36] you get the others are titles
[1:11:39] and you don't have a promise the bible
[1:11:40] says it gives you the holy ghost if
[1:11:41] you're getting baptized the name of
[1:11:42] jesus christ so i want to tell you if
[1:11:44] anybody else next sunday wants to be
[1:11:45] baptized
[1:11:47] we're going to have a baptismal servant
[1:11:49] if anybody else wants to be baptized
[1:11:51] again you say i always baptized when i
[1:11:53] was a kid well you know what so was i
[1:11:56] but i got re-baptized
[1:11:58] just to make sure i wanted to show that
[1:12:00] i was doing it
[1:12:01] doing it right in my conscience
[1:12:03] and what is it is to tell the world that
[1:12:05] i am a christian and my water baptism
[1:12:09] doesn't save me
[1:12:11] no no no
[1:12:12] but it does put you in the right
[1:12:14] direction
[1:12:15] to receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:12:16] is everybody okay with that i got off on
[1:12:18] the rabbit trail sorry
[1:12:20] if a man served me let him follow me and
[1:12:21] where i am there shall be al be servant
[1:12:23] be if a man serve me him will my father
[1:12:26] honor now is my soul troubled and what
[1:12:28] shall i say father save me from this
[1:12:30] hour but for this cause came onto this
[1:12:32] hour father glorify thy name then came
[1:12:35] there a voice from heaven
[1:12:38] saying i have both glorified it
[1:12:41] and will glorify it again what's the
[1:12:43] name of the son of man jesus christ
[1:12:46] they crucified him and killed him he
[1:12:47] came back on the day of pentecost as the
[1:12:49] son of god but
[1:12:50] at the end time he's got to come back as
[1:12:53] the son of man again
[1:12:55] the lord jesus christ the correct
[1:12:56] baptism the correct no trinitarian
[1:12:58] doctrine and all these different things
[1:13:00] that that everybody else preaches it's
[1:13:01] not even in the bible
[1:13:03] amen
[1:13:04] the word purgatory is not even in the
[1:13:06] bible
[1:13:07] eternal hell not him in the bible
[1:13:10] but my mama told me that well your mama
[1:13:11] was wrong
[1:13:13] don't talk about my mama i ain't talking
[1:13:14] about you mama talking about the devil
[1:13:16] that was in here
[1:13:29] some of y'all don't know that do you
[1:13:31] who lies
[1:13:32] the devil
[1:13:33] and if the devil said it he's lying i
[1:13:36] don't care who he said it through yeah
[1:13:39] i say it preach it brother preach it
[1:13:42] all right we got one more thing and then
[1:13:44] we'll then we'll close right here i'll
[1:13:45] try not to be i'm going to cut some of
[1:13:47] this out
[1:13:49] why did they use
[1:13:52] palm branches
[1:13:54] this is considered palm sunday
[1:13:57] he said well by the way that's all they
[1:13:58] had all they had was palm trees no they
[1:14:00] had a lot of other different kind of
[1:14:01] trees they had fig trees
[1:14:03] but they picked up palm trees
[1:14:06] so let's go to nehemiah eight
[1:14:09] first fourteen everybody okay this is
[1:14:11] gonna be just kind of light today simple
[1:14:12] we got company today so tonight this
[1:14:15] afternoon we'll we'll we'll grill some
[1:14:17] steak
[1:14:21] it's pretty good steak to me already i
[1:14:23] like a little chopstick every once in a
[1:14:24] while you know
[1:14:26] all right nehemiah 8 verse 14 and they
[1:14:28] found written in the law which the lord
[1:14:29] had commanded by moses that the children
[1:14:31] of israel should dwell in booths
[1:14:33] in the feast of the seventh month
[1:14:35] and that they should publish and
[1:14:36] proclaim in all their cities and in
[1:14:38] jerusalem saying go forth into the
[1:14:39] mountain fetch olive branches pine
[1:14:42] branches myrtle branches palm branches
[1:14:45] and branches of thick trees to make
[1:14:47] boosts
[1:14:48] does everybody know where i'm going with
[1:14:49] this
[1:14:51] so the people went forth and brought
[1:14:53] them and made themselves booths
[1:14:57] everyone upon the roof of his house and
[1:14:59] in their court in the courts of the
[1:15:00] house of god and in the street of the
[1:15:02] watergate and in the street of the gate
[1:15:04] of ephraim
[1:15:06] why was that used what was that what
[1:15:08] were they doing
[1:15:12] it was the feast of tabernacles
[1:15:15] they were told to make bowels of trees
[1:15:18] and take them and put them together and
[1:15:19] make a booth and go sit in it
[1:15:24] so what were they doing
[1:15:26] they were putting palm leaves out
[1:15:29] they were testifying
[1:15:31] that that was god in the temple
[1:15:34] not the great temple that they were
[1:15:35] looking at over there it was god in that
[1:15:37] temple right there everything jesus did
[1:15:39] had some kind of significance everything
[1:15:42] every move he made was some kind of a
[1:15:44] type and a shadow
[1:15:45] well the type of this is god dwelling in
[1:15:48] a temple they were they were testifying
[1:15:50] hosanna god save us in human flesh
[1:15:54] god you i know you got to come there but
[1:15:56] they never said that
[1:15:57] they didn't get a revelation of it they
[1:15:59] just got caught up in the act they just
[1:16:01] got caught up into and so i guess we say
[1:16:03] in the end time into hoopla
[1:16:06] we got caught up they got caught up in
[1:16:08] the moment
[1:16:12] but what was the end result
[1:16:14] they still killed him
[1:16:16] they killed god in a human flesh they
[1:16:18] killed god in a temple
[1:16:19] oh no that temple that temple we've been
[1:16:22] what do you mean three days you're going
[1:16:24] to tear it down it took us 49 years to
[1:16:25] build that temple out in the world can
[1:16:27] you take it down in three days and raise
[1:16:29] it back up what kind of man are you he
[1:16:31] wasn't talking natural he was talking
[1:16:32] spiritually talking about this temple
[1:16:34] about this body god doesn't care about
[1:16:36] this building out here today he doesn't
[1:16:38] care how big of a building you build in
[1:16:39] the temple the big uh cathedrals and all
[1:16:42] those different things god don't care
[1:16:43] one thing about that
[1:16:45] god told us in the end time that he
[1:16:47] would dwell in human flesh
[1:16:49] he would dwell in your temple and you
[1:16:51] would be an outer court you'd be an
[1:16:53] inner court and you'd have a holy of
[1:16:55] holies down inside of you there's a soul
[1:16:57] that nobody can get to but satan and god
[1:17:00] if you don't have god there you got the
[1:17:02] devil there i'm sorry
[1:17:04] if you're not a child of god this
[1:17:05] morning you're a child of the devil
[1:17:08] and you do what he says
[1:17:10] oh no yeah you do
[1:17:12] i did yes
[1:17:14] i did
[1:17:17] i listened to him more than i listened
[1:17:19] to god that's what got me in trouble all
[1:17:20] right
[1:17:25] but you're a tabernacle
[1:17:27] even though
[1:17:29] you're a human being
[1:17:31] god wants to use your tabernacle
[1:17:34] he wants to ride into your tabernacle
[1:17:37] he wants to go into your holy of holies
[1:17:40] and he wants to give you all these
[1:17:42] blessings
[1:17:43] and all these symbols that we've looked
[1:17:45] at all on that whole week coming up to
[1:17:48] to um
[1:17:49] to easter sunday
[1:17:51] it was a significance because you know
[1:17:53] what folks you got to let him in your
[1:17:55] kingdom first
[1:17:59] you gotta let him into your jerusalem
[1:18:01] first
[1:18:02] you got to pronounce him king of kings
[1:18:05] you've got to lay the palm
[1:18:07] vows down and say god i know where
[1:18:09] you're at
[1:18:11] but i god won't do you any good if you
[1:18:13] know where he's at there out there
[1:18:17] i know right where god's at
[1:18:20] well
[1:18:21] then that means you're somewhere else
[1:18:24] what about say god's here
[1:18:26] i know where god's at today
[1:18:28] god's residing in this person today
[1:18:31] whether you like it or not whether i got
[1:18:32] on the right kind of clothes that you
[1:18:34] the color you need for me to wear of
[1:18:35] course i wear nice clothes
[1:18:37] i buy my own clothes so i'll wear a nice
[1:18:39] cloth
[1:18:43] but god
[1:18:44] wants to dwell in your flesh more than
[1:18:46] you want him to
[1:18:49] more than you want him to
[1:18:51] he wants to do more for you
[1:18:53] but here we are the week of the holiest
[1:18:55] week of the year
[1:18:57] now we as christians we have a holy week
[1:19:00] every week
[1:19:01] but let's just bring it and squeeze it
[1:19:03] into this week coming up we've got a
[1:19:05] service coming up friday saturday and
[1:19:07] sunday that we've never had before a
[1:19:08] three-day service like that with people
[1:19:10] coming in but you know what let's don't
[1:19:12] make it a drudgery let's make it
[1:19:14] as those people were putting those palm
[1:19:17] trees down and they were watching this
[1:19:19] scene unfold
[1:19:21] we know as bride
[1:19:24] that was the headstone
[1:19:26] that was the man of the hour
[1:19:29] he wasn't the second person of a trinity
[1:19:31] right right he was god
[1:19:34] because they were identifying him as a
[1:19:35] king
[1:19:37] if he was a king was that man god
[1:19:40] something else
[1:19:42] no that was king
[1:19:43] that was king god
[1:19:45] i'll read a couple quotes and then we'll
[1:19:46] close right here prophet of god says and
[1:19:48] god provided way in connersville indiana
[1:19:52] i'll read just a couple of quotes
[1:19:54] because once you listen to come some of
[1:19:56] this
[1:19:57] the prophet of god said look
[1:19:59] certainly god has a provided way
[1:20:02] now remember he didn't come in the back
[1:20:04] door
[1:20:05] he came in the gates of jerusalem
[1:20:07] to proclaim who he was
[1:20:10] but now remember
[1:20:11] that was going to be the roughest week
[1:20:12] he'd ever had in his life
[1:20:14] he was going to die he wasn't going to
[1:20:16] come back through those gates again
[1:20:17] alive
[1:20:18] he was going to be dead way back before
[1:20:20] there was a world that shouted religion
[1:20:22] where was you god said to job when i
[1:20:24] laid the foundation of the world when
[1:20:26] the morning stars sang together and the
[1:20:27] sons of god shouted for joy amen
[1:20:30] have i got something new no he's talking
[1:20:32] about his religion it's still the same
[1:20:34] hallelujah no wonder when that stone
[1:20:36] came rolling into jerusalem all the
[1:20:39] people singing hosanna hosanna and them
[1:20:41] stark's priest said make them holy peace
[1:20:44] oh
[1:20:46] y'all don't say amen
[1:20:49] just nod your head
[1:20:50] like some of y'all do
[1:20:54] you know what jesus said
[1:20:57] remember even john john was standing on
[1:20:58] the river and he said
[1:21:00] you can be quiet if you want to
[1:21:03] he said but the rocks
[1:21:05] will start shouting if you don't
[1:21:08] the bare rocks on this ground will start
[1:21:10] shouting if you don't start shouting the
[1:21:12] victory that the headstone or the head
[1:21:15] man or the king has walked into your
[1:21:17] house into your habitation
[1:21:20] all right
[1:21:21] brother brown said in blind bartimaeus
[1:21:23] he said oh this was a mixed multitude
[1:21:26] he said but here came the very captain
[1:21:28] of the host
[1:21:30] the very captain of the host away with
[1:21:33] him away with him some say
[1:21:36] same way with some of us
[1:21:38] away with him i don't need i don't know
[1:21:40] don't tell me how to live
[1:21:44] i'm not
[1:21:46] read the bible
[1:21:48] because if you're a christian that's
[1:21:49] what you used to live by
[1:21:51] if you choose to live by the world's
[1:21:53] books just continue on that way because
[1:21:54] you're going to go to hell right
[1:21:57] i'm sorry
[1:21:59] oh no i'm good
[1:22:01] they're going to be a lot of good people
[1:22:02] in hell
[1:22:04] actually a whole bunch of good people is
[1:22:06] going to be in hell
[1:22:07] i don't want to be good
[1:22:11] i don't want to stand before the white
[1:22:13] throne judgment and be judged by what i
[1:22:15] am and what i did
[1:22:17] that's why
[1:22:18] you get the holy ghost and this man i'm
[1:22:20] talking to you about right here
[1:22:23] in pilates hall and took your judgment
[1:22:26] he got on a cross to take your judgment
[1:22:29] now i can say put it all on him
[1:22:33] because he said
[1:22:35] put it all on me
[1:22:37] he said bring me your heavy burdens and
[1:22:39] i'll give you rest
[1:22:41] he said oh
[1:22:42] get that yolk off of you and put it on
[1:22:44] me
[1:22:46] even if there is a yolk on you it's
[1:22:47] gonna be so light you won't even know
[1:22:48] it's on yeah you won't even know us damn
[1:22:52] that's the man i'm talking about but
[1:22:54] there's always a mixed multitude and
[1:22:56] there he was
[1:22:59] you hypocrite there's nothing to you
[1:23:01] some of them hollered hosanna oh
[1:23:04] a mixed multitude but along there

[1:23:10] the very captain of the host
[1:23:12] he had become human flesh
[1:23:15] that had met joshua
[1:23:17] isn't he the captain of the host
[1:23:19] he was the angel of the covenant
[1:23:22] now look
[1:23:23] all those are titles
[1:23:26] and positions that one man held
[1:23:32] jesus christ
[1:23:35] so why would you want to be baptized any
[1:23:36] other way

[1:23:41] i took the name of dale but i am a
[1:23:43] father i am a son and i'm a human being
[1:23:45] but my name is not father son or human
[1:23:48] being
[1:23:50] that's why we baptized correct baptism
[1:23:52] according to acts 2 38 why did peter say
[1:23:54] that if god gave him the keys he went
[1:23:57] god wasn't up there going give me the
[1:23:58] key back give me keep back give me keep
[1:24:00] back right
[1:24:01] now he's up there going open the door
[1:24:03] peter
[1:24:05] stick that thing in that door and open
[1:24:07] it
[1:24:08] cause i need to get down there and then
[1:24:10] a group of people and give the holy
[1:24:11] ghost
[1:24:14] angel the covenant the pillar of fire
[1:24:16] and here he was again when the people
[1:24:18] are shouting the days of miracles has
[1:24:19] passed all hope is gone here comes the
[1:24:21] captain of the host of the lord
[1:24:24] coming by just on time he always arrives
[1:24:26] just right
[1:24:28] he said if they hold their peace the
[1:24:30] rocks will immediately cry out
[1:24:32] something
[1:24:33] has to take place
[1:24:35] yes sir
[1:24:37] something
[1:24:38] has
[1:24:39] to take place
[1:24:46] let's just stop right there
[1:24:47] let's read let's go to the very last one
[1:24:49] let's read it
[1:24:51] only a prophet could tell
[1:24:53] a story
[1:24:55] like this
[1:24:57] you know even brother adam brings blind
[1:24:58] bartimaeus he said he was there during
[1:25:00] all that was when that was going on
[1:25:02] how do you know that
[1:25:04] number seven
[1:25:05] or no seven
[1:25:07] seven
[1:25:08] there you
[1:25:10] go what is the attraction on the
[1:25:12] mountain now it had been a very weary
[1:25:14] nervous day
[1:25:17] if you're having a nervous day today
[1:25:19] enter into this story
[1:25:21] if you're having trouble today
[1:25:23] enter into this story
[1:25:25] all right this story was told for your
[1:25:27] example today
[1:25:29] god set you in this poop in this place
[1:25:31] today he set you in that pew today to
[1:25:34] listen to this sermon now what are you
[1:25:35] going to do with it are you going to
[1:25:37] shout hosanna to the king are you going
[1:25:38] to say crucify him
[1:25:40] all right now been a very weary nervous
[1:25:42] day
[1:25:43] it was an unusual day
[1:25:46] we find jesus coming to jerusalem
[1:25:48] ready to attend the passover
[1:25:50] and the passover is where the paschal
[1:25:52] lamb was killed and the blood was spread
[1:25:54] upon the mercy seat for the atonement
[1:25:55] for the people
[1:25:57] and he had come up from beth podge and
[1:25:58] had come to the top of the mount of
[1:26:00] olives which looked down upon a little
[1:26:02] hill where jerusalem was built
[1:26:04] and he looked and knowed
[1:26:06] that was his final visit
[1:26:12] that was his final visit
[1:26:15] and a human being with human eyes that
[1:26:16] was his final visit he wasn't going to
[1:26:18] visit that place anymore
[1:26:21] this was the time that when he would be
[1:26:23] delivered into the hands of sinful man
[1:26:25] and they would kill him
[1:26:27] he would die the horriblest death that
[1:26:29] was ever died by immortal
[1:26:31] and be buried
[1:26:32] he would be betrayed by his own some of
[1:26:35] them standing right with him
[1:26:36] and him being god knew what was in their
[1:26:39] heart and knew from the beginning
[1:26:41] who would betray him
[1:26:43] and knowed what man was with him who set
[1:26:44] by his side and counted his money and so
[1:26:47] forth know that man would betray him
[1:26:49] knew that a cruel roman cross waited for
[1:26:51] him out there he knew that his water in
[1:26:53] his body and his blood of his body would
[1:26:55] separate and that the blood would drop
[1:26:57] off of his forehead great big drops like
[1:26:59] perspiration
[1:27:00] and he knew all that was before him
[1:27:03] and he stands up on the mountain
[1:27:05] looking over jerusalem and i'll finish
[1:27:07] the story and he turns and walks into
[1:27:09] the city
[1:27:11] he says go get me a donkey
[1:27:15] because i'm going to identify who i am
[1:27:18] the people are going to love me
[1:27:20] but the people are going to hate me
[1:27:22] but i'm going toward jerusalem i'm
[1:27:24] headed to that place knowing that i'll
[1:27:26] never stand on this mountain again
[1:27:28] that this is going to be my final visit
[1:27:32] but thank god
[1:27:35] it wasn't his final visit to human
[1:27:36] beings
[1:27:38] it was not his final visit to human
[1:27:40] beings he was standing in one place god
[1:27:42] almighty and human flesh
[1:27:45] now he's gone almighty in many human
[1:27:47] fleshes
[1:27:48] all over the world he has multiplied
[1:27:50] himself
[1:27:51] because palm sunday looked bad it looked
[1:27:54] horrible for this man called jesus he
[1:27:57] was having all kind of issues and
[1:27:58] troubles and trials he said even father
