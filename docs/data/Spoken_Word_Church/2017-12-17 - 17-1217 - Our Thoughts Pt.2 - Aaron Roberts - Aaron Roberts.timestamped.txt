[0:03] [Music]
[0:13] don't bless you this morning we're gonna
[0:21] look in the second Corinthians chapter
[0:23] 10 before we're trading last week just
[0:29] couple of verses here it's gonna be
[0:32] short and sweet this morning first first
[0:41] 2 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 3 says
[0:44] without reading all that it says for
[0:47] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[0:49] war after the flesh for the weapons of
[0:53] our warfare are not carnal but mighty
[0:55] through God to the pulling down of
[0:57] strongholds casting down imaginations
[0:58] and every high thing that exalteth
[1:01] itself against the knowledge of God and
[1:03] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:06] the obedience of Christ so that's what
[1:11] we're talking about our our thoughts and
[1:14] heaven mmm a right mental attitude no
[1:20] brother brems said a right mental
[1:21] attitude and I report any divine promise
[1:24] around will bring it to pass attitude as
[1:30] well as a wave as our way of thinking or
[1:33] we're feeling something we have the same
[1:36] way of thing
[1:42] the in the message the Africa trip
[1:46] report is where really round talks about
[1:49] the lady that was praying and he said
[1:55] that they had taken take another swing a
[2:00] lie-detector machine and it changed it
[2:02] and was able to measure this lady she
[2:05] was praying pattern day up and said
[2:09] enough power went out while she was
[2:11] praying that make the needle come around
[2:13] as far as it go enough power leaving
[2:16] that woman actually sippie's that
[2:18] supernatural power that called on this
[2:20] machine some kind of magnetic power of
[2:22] her prayer that was powerful enough to
[2:24] send a radio message 55 times around the
[2:27] world oh it's pretty uh pretty amazing
[2:33] the power the power that we have in
[2:35] prayer our thoughts are louder in heaven
[2:43] that are that are words or and proverbs
[2:48] 3:5 says trust in the Lord with all that
[2:52] heart and leading up to that own
[2:54] understanding Frank and you know brother
[2:57] they open preaching the last little
[2:59] while even in the in the Garden of Eden
[3:05] and you know brother Brown said to Eve
[3:07] got out from behind the word and to
[3:10] begin to reasoning on what was there but
[3:13] but if she had just stayed with the word
[3:15] instead of trying to reason with it and
[3:18] said that was her fault and you know we
[3:21] give you the same thing we've tried to
[3:24] reason on the word and up just then
[3:26] fortified behind the word and you know
[3:28] it's you know we go through trials and
[3:32] everything like we saw about last
[3:33] weekend you know but you find a script
[3:36] shot mine is Romans 8:28 we know that
[3:40] all things were gonna give to her
[3:41] whatever happens we know it works for
[3:44] you know I don't have to try to figure
[3:46] it out but I know somewhere along the
[3:49] way it we and and sometimes you know we
[3:53] wonder why but you know what hey I got
[3:57] it may not be that we find out on this
[3:58] side but you know are we have you know
[4:09] our thoughts and you know we always like
[4:12] to anybody
[4:14] I admit sir a person yet they don't like
[4:17] to think you know they're right or you
[4:22] know they think they have the best way
[4:24] you know because you know like at work
[4:29] you try to talk to people sometimes and
[4:31] it don't matter what it is any any
[4:33] simple thing but you get people that you
[4:35] know they don't obey us and you know you
[4:38] can't you can't explain anything to even
[4:42] though you try to you know you're trying
[4:45] to help them out and they think you're
[4:47] trying to be a know-it-all and you know
[4:51] our reasoning factor is as I gave
[4:55] illustrations last week we find out our
[4:57] our mental capacities not what it what
[4:59] it what we think it is you know we're
[5:03] finite God is infinite and you know in
[5:07] Isaiah God says my ways are not your
[5:11] ways my thoughts are your thoughts they
[5:14] said my thoughts are higher than your
[5:16] thoughts and and so you know we've
[5:19] proved that you know sometimes we we
[5:23] look at things and you know the brother
[5:25] Brent said to see in the scripture when
[5:27] talks about to sing means to understand
[5:29] and sometimes we don't even the
[5:32] scripture Jesus was talking about one
[5:33] time was talking about the the Pharisees
[5:37] everything saying that you know they
[5:40] would see but not perceived they would
[5:42] not understand you would think would
[5:44] hear but they're not actually here I
[5:46] mean they're hearing the words but
[5:47] they're not understanding what's being
[5:48] saying it and you know many times we're
[5:51] in the same situation we hear
[5:54] thanks but we don't to sleep we don't
[5:56] understand what's being said and we see
[5:58] things and you know years ago they had
[6:01] at a college they had a daughter in the
[6:05] dorm rooms they had all these different
[6:06] laws and rules about different things
[6:09] you couldn't could not have in your dorm
[6:11] room well these two young enterprising
[6:14] young gentlemen in college they had a
[6:17] microwave in their dorm room which was
[6:20] against the rules
[6:21] but they kept the microwave and the dorm
[6:25] runs for four years because they kept
[6:28] rabbit ears on the top of it and
[6:33] everybody coming and going does not
[6:35] realize that it was not a television
[6:40] saying we see things but we don't
[6:42] perceive what we're seeing and so many
[6:46] times you know we see things and that's
[6:49] what the devil wants us to focus on
[6:52] because you know the universe is saying
[6:54] that every cloud has a silver lining
[6:56] when we see that we don't see the silver
[6:59] lining we don't see God working in the
[7:02] situation we see the negative of it we
[7:05] don't see the positive and many times
[7:08] you know we that's what devil wants us
[7:09] to focus on is the things that and you
[7:13] know there's man that's you know has
[7:17] spent I guess from the beginning of time
[7:20] you know thinking and trying to prove
[7:24] things and your brother Brent said man
[7:26] broke into God's laboratory and figured
[7:28] out a lot of things and was able to do a
[7:29] lot of things and you know nowadays it's
[7:32] just about whatever man can imagine they
[7:34] can produce and you know he continued
[7:38] but you know the thing is that he fails
[7:39] to understand that you know I was
[7:44] thinking about theater dr. Crawford long
[7:45] and you know had the the doctor lives in
[7:49] Jefferson back in the 1800 a was the
[7:51] first one to use ether is a anesthesia
[7:53] to put somebody to sleep to have surgery
[7:55] and you know we think about what a very
[7:59] complex memory that was and you know
[8:02] it's continuing on and anybody that's
[8:03] ever had surgery you know you think
[8:05] that they have that meant you know you'd
[8:08] hate to have to do it like they done
[8:09] during the Civil War you know it was it
[8:13] was speed not skill that they were using
[8:16] them do surgery back then you know they
[8:19] just saw their legs off yeah you know
[8:21] they had a story one time with him as a
[8:23] man it was Ben he was assisting of a
[8:26] surgeon he was working on somebody's leg
[8:29] and the man lost his thumb while that
[8:30] may have lost his legs and in the midst
[8:33] of all of that you know what his speed
[8:34] you know when they started they didn't
[8:36] stop till they were done it just boom
[8:37] but you know what what a me makes me you
[8:42] know you think about that but you know
[8:44] God done that along Tommy for that
[8:46] Abraham was smoke around sleep and
[8:48] removed a real blonde before man ever
[8:51] got into that but yo man got into God's
[8:53] laboratory was able to come up with that
[8:55] but Jim all these things and you know
[8:59] brother Brett said radio and television
[9:02] you know it's always been here but you
[9:03] know all these things always were in
[9:05] here but you men was able to discover
[9:08] these things and you know all of the the
[9:12] things that God has done all the way
[9:14] through the history that we've seen God
[9:17] do and then man has been able to
[9:20] replicate that in his own finite way but
[9:25] you know God has already already had
[9:27] that power and he's already demonstrated
[9:29] that power and as I look what I'm doing
[9:30] what God's already done and you know
[9:33] because he eight tries to man likes to
[9:37] think he's more than he is you know and
[9:42] what's the push gone out of the way but
[9:44] you know brother Brown said that but man
[9:50] through his through his mentality
[9:52] through his thinking through his
[9:55] reasoning power say God will destroy the
[9:57] earth God won't destroy man they said
[10:01] man will destroy man man to destroy the
[10:03] earth
[10:03] but McCall's he he's able to tap into
[10:06] something but he's not able to harness
[10:08] he's not able to control it because
[10:10] that's not what man was designed to do
[10:12] man was designed to follow God and let
[10:15] allow God to do these
[10:17] but we know that's what we knew that
[10:19] what struck looks more to take place but
[10:21] you know the power that we have is not
[10:24] in ourselves it's in heal in many times
[10:27] you people want to try to hold on to
[10:30] things that their sales and and do
[10:34] things in themselves that they're not
[10:36] supposed to do right and you know you
[10:39] know through you know we have a lot of
[10:43] studying man has spent many years and
[10:51] you know thinking you know man mammal
[10:53] stuff you know what do we have a great
[10:57] men in this world you know we that
[10:59] people hope about is like you know
[11:02] Socrates and Aristotle and Pythagoras
[11:05] and you know all these great men these
[11:07] great thinkers you know and you know
[11:09] they they've come up with all these
[11:10] great laws and there's a great area of
[11:14] study we call it philosophy you know
[11:16] everybody has a philosophy about
[11:18] everything that goes on you know we have
[11:20] a philosophy about about science or
[11:22] economics or whatever you know everybody
[11:24] has their philosophy but you know the
[11:26] one thing that people don't realize is
[11:28] you can have a philosophy but there's
[11:31] only it only is a little bit but it's
[11:33] limited and you know the thing is is
[11:36] people like a part of a part of
[11:39] philosophy is logic is the study of
[11:43] logic and critical thinking but you know
[11:45] brother man was talking about you know
[11:47] the one thing that we have to go back to
[11:49] it is to have the when we when we think
[11:54] about critical thinking and logic and
[11:56] you know if you have to have a a
[12:02] an introduction yep you know you have to
[12:05] have a vote preface you know you have to
[12:09] have a question you have to have have
[12:12] something that you start with and you
[12:15] know the thing is as many people they
[12:18] think morning look at many different
[12:19] things in life but your brother is
[12:21] talking about the one thing that you had
[12:23] to do that was most the most logical
[12:24] it's take it back to the word and so
[12:28] many people you know we have a
[12:29] philosophy of this and a philosophy of
[12:31] that but you know God said let my word
[12:35] be true and every man is a liar and so
[12:39] you know we expect many years we have
[12:41] philosophies and reasoning and logic
[12:46] different things that you know people
[12:47] have spent many years trying to look at
[12:49] and and you know the more that man has
[12:53] tried to prove God wrong the more they
[12:55] proved him right but you know they they
[12:57] keep trying to I believe in the men was
[13:01] Carl's young the great psychologist they
[13:06] said one time he said we need to find
[13:08] him where God fits in to human society
[13:12] and humanity he said so we can get him
[13:15] out see they had psychologists you know
[13:21] they don't want to deal with God they
[13:25] want to push him to the side because see
[13:27] they they want all the emphasis to be on
[13:29] them and they think you know we've got a
[13:31] lot of people that want to try to solve
[13:34] all men's problems you know we have a
[13:37] lot of people that you know where
[13:38] they're looking for a utopia oh if you
[13:42] know if we can just do this if we can
[13:44] just do that if we can have the
[13:46] Democrats in power if we can have the
[13:47] Republicans in power if we can have this
[13:49] or that or you know some other kind of
[13:51] philosophy what makes will be better but
[13:56] you know one spend thousands and
[13:57] thousands and thousands of years and you
[13:58] know it's never challenged it is never
[14:02] going to change
[14:03] and then so you know it doesn't matter
[14:07] who we put in power who we take out of
[14:09] power those different things we know
[14:11] God's in control of all that but you
[14:13] know what it's never going to check
[14:15] why because human nature doesn't change
[14:19] the desire of fallen man's never won't
[14:22] change and so it's never one that's
[14:25] never going to work the way it soon it
[14:27] looks good on paper it's it's good when
[14:29] they talk about it
[14:30] but it never works in France and the
[14:35] only time we know that we know where the
[14:38] answer is we know that when when we're
[14:41] taking out of here and God comes back in
[14:44] a millennial then everything will be
[14:46] perfect then there'll be exactly the way
[14:50] God wanted to be but until then you know
[14:53] we still have the same issues and and
[14:56] problems that we've always had but Jill
[15:07] we have a lot of people have reasoning
[15:14] and you know brother I'm speaking in
[15:18] greatest battle ever fault and he was
[15:21] speaking of hey you've opened up her
[15:25] mind to reasoning and that's when the
[15:28] fall came in and
[15:33] you know we have to get away from our
[15:36] human reasoning and look to what God has
[15:39] for us
[15:45] and Isaiah 1:18 where it says you know
[15:50] come let us reason together you know
[15:53] many people we have a reasoning factor
[15:57] but my brother Brett said if we go back
[16:00] if you want to solve a problem then
[16:04] you've got to go back to where the
[16:07] answer is and if you you know rod
[16:12] Randall was talking about and contending
[16:17] for the faith he was talking about you
[16:21] know we want to look back to see what
[16:23] God done in the Pentecost and what he
[16:27] done in the beginning he said well where
[16:28] do we go we go back to the work to see
[16:30] what they had because it says it let us
[16:33] an attempt for the faith that was once
[16:36] delivered to the Saints then we need to
[16:38] see what they had well the only way you
[16:40] find that is in the word and go back and
[16:41] look and find out what they had and see
[16:45] if we look back to find out what they
[16:47] had deal we can contend for exactly what
[16:49] they had but you have to find the same
[16:51] place that they were after and you know
[16:54] many people are nervous we look for
[16:56] something well you have to go back to
[16:58] the same place the brother Bell said you
[17:00] know if if we want to be healed if we
[17:02] want to be saved
[17:03] he said if he ever done it for one
[17:05] person he said if you go back and meet
[17:08] the same conditions you have to come
[17:10] back to the same place where they were
[17:11] they said if you meet the same
[17:13] requirements that they did they said
[17:15] that he's obligated to do the same time
[17:19] and you know and so it's in its begins
[17:22] with our fault process and you know
[17:26] brother Brown was talking to a man and
[17:29] he was cat blues Catholic and pig you
[17:33] know he was talking up about me and you
[17:36] know brother brown I want to be Catholic
[17:38] and we go to hear Irish and you know
[17:40] brother man was talking about but you
[17:44] know looking at the scripture and the
[17:47] man said oh no we can't look at the
[17:48] scripture you know we don't we don't
[17:50] deal with this victory so well you know
[17:52] then there's no place to start
[17:54] and so the thing is is if if you're
[17:58] gonna have a like we say a debate to try
[18:02] to solve a problem try to come up with a
[18:05] conclusion yes sir
[18:07] ten more minutes but if you two minute
[18:12] morning but you know if you want to come
[18:16] to the same conclusion you have to come
[18:20] to this everybody has to come to the
[18:21] same place and start from the same place
[18:24] and until everybody comes to the side to
[18:27] start from the Word of God we can't be
[18:30] able to advance and so you know there's
[18:33] many things in in our lives and these
[18:37] things in that we look at the has to do
[18:43] with our our thoughts and our thinking
[18:47] and you know if we if we go back and
[18:50] think the right kind of thoughts I was
[18:55] trying to find that where brother Ernie
[18:56] I was trying to find that thing where
[18:58] brother any talked about you know he
[18:59] said it's your your thoughts become your
[19:04] words and your words become your actions
[19:08] and your actions become your destiny
[19:11] something along those lines of travel
[19:14] but your priorities real famous for
[19:16] quoting that you know Joey it starts
[19:18] with your way your thoughts oh one of
[19:20] your thoughts are and you know many
[19:22] times the you know the old saying is is
[19:26] ships don't sink because they're in the
[19:29] water ship sink when the water gets in
[19:33] England
[19:35] you know it's not the things that
[19:37] happened to us that we see that surround
[19:40] us it's the things that we allow to get
[19:42] inside there are thorough mind your
[19:45] brother Rob said that was the the
[19:47] greatest battle ever fought was in the
[19:49] mind and that's the same battle we fight
[19:51] today and you know it starts with our
[19:55] our intent your brother wings when we
[20:00] can but you know it starts with all
[20:02] right what is that what is our
[20:03] intentions you know we have a and our in
[20:09] our court system you make this a lot of
[20:11] people that get in trouble with us but
[20:14] the thing when you go to court you can
[20:17] get there certain there's certain crimes
[20:19] that you have to prove the person's
[20:21] intent to convey front but then you know
[20:25] there's other crimes they don't have to
[20:27] prove you're in T they just didn't they
[20:29] just show that you've done something if
[20:32] they arrest you for trespassing they
[20:34] don't have to prove that you have it if
[20:36] the sign says no trans fats in your
[20:38] their location and you know but you know
[20:43] there's other crimes they have to prove
[20:44] your intent map to others
