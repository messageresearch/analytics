========================================

it's already probably thank you let's get together today their names pretty blessed to some services today more than internship here help us in the Sunday School class orders to understand what bit more value that we're the way missed their Alabama I'll give us that keep them safe right tall as they can the afflicted so today's lesson here is going to be about The Tortoise and the hare and no joke I'm not doing this to be comical y'all can laugh but I mean it's it's a cute little story song but it's got a good name on the last lesson I'm talking L without humility it's been back in probably in February a long time ago but this is actually a continuation of that so and how important it is to humble ourselves before God so when I was a little kid aunt Denise had given my sister I'll take your rough skin you don't know what that is yeah she gave me up mother Goose all right so growing up I was listen to this little stuffed animal it was a goose and it was robotic kind of creepy and it would actually is awesome blinking it with its feet would move and it would tell stories and this was one of the stories that it were telling them when I have these books I follow along and like members new clothes I think and the tortoise and the hare the blue red hand and all the most little kids stories that tell life lessons and this is one that's really stood out to me over the years because I've never been one to be competitive I've never been one to try to to do better than somebody else and I'm really not very competitive a person that anything typically on the highway I tend to hold back and let the other guy go but I hate people being behind me and I hate holding people up in any way so I'm not competitive but I'm a person that I'm slow and stay alright and that was the more of that story so first I want to review the actual children's or a favorite not purge the story for The Tortoise and the hare we'll go over all right this break winner so and the objective of today by the way just go get that out of the way what I want you all to do today is to understand the importance of a constant spiritual growth very simple very profound very very important all right I thought this little idea of a parable the parable of the tortoise and the hare a few years ago and I spent bearing on my heart here lately and I think I really ought to share it so so the story goes like this and I have lots of different pictures from different stories that they had on Google the different versions of the story so some are going to be more real looking some will be cartoon pictures just bear with me on the pictures okay use your imagination but the story goes like this so the tortoise and the hare were going to do a footrace and the first one across the finish line a forfeit win and now of course you know that a hare is built for speed and they're a lot faster and a tortoise could ever think of being so right off the bat you know there's no competition you know who's going to win or who should win so they take off home race on the race day they take off from the starting line and in route away the hair takes off and leaves the tortoise didn't steal nothing no surprises really and all the while through this race the tortoise has this I mean the hare has this sort of exalted sort of haughty attitude that I can't lose I can't fail I want to win there's no egg you lose this race meanwhile The Tortoise take some more humble disposition he's he knows he can't in yourself luke 18:9 this goes well with this story and expect this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others two men went up into the temple to pray the one a Pharisee and the other republican the Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself God I think that I'm not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this Republican I fast twice in the week I give tithes of all that I possess and the publican standing afar off were not lift up so much as his eyes under heaven but smote upon his breast saying God be merciful to me the sinner I tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for everyone that exalted themselves to be abased and he that hung them homeless themselves to be insulted so the hair is represented or is representative of this one who trusts in his own himself and his own nobility his own whatever you want to call it now and then the tortoise is a more humble so now what happens through their actual race as the as the children's story goes the hare runs along well until he decides I can't lose I'm so good I'm not at the finish line yet but I think I'm going to sit down for a little while take it easy I'm gonna take a little break there's no way the tortoise will ever past me so he sits off to the side and then he and he the story I was told as a kid goes like this that he said in a clover patch and he was sitting there maybe even though these different clovers and things and he got sleeping fell asleep while he slept the tortoise passed him and finished the race so the last leg of the race here comes the courts the hare still sleeping awake and crosses the thin I went alright slow and steady wins the race that's the wall of the story it's called perseverance what the supernal had his first repair first Corinthians 9:24 know ye not that all day was run in a race run all but one receiveth the promise so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery is Shepherd in all things now they do it to obtain crumpled crown but we an incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertainly so far I'm not just one that beateth the air but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway so now here is the parable of the tortoise and the hare pixilated sorry about the picture all right so on race day first of all the hair is bragging he's post you know how people do in competitions in like athletes before maybe or aggressively names or something they'll try to imitate each other and they'll say well I'm going to bring your head off your neck I'm gonna throw it against the wall I'm gonna put you in the nose and you can't win all these things they're real intimidated for 20 toward one another and real boastful and bragging and that's how the hair was for the tortoise and the tortoise being the humble disposition he said may the best critter win so Philippians 4:13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me that strengthens me that's the tortoises attitudes he knows right off the bat he can't win this race he knows he's not equipped for it and he knows he can't do it without help so that works to his advantage so they take off on race day as I said earlier now this guy their their their faces show their attitude he's got this haughty attitude nananana booboo you can't catch me he's got this humble attitude and this sort of optimism that I know I can't beat you but someone can help me and I can win I can still win the strikes he never never gets discouraged he's always up and going and that's how a Christian is you never get discouraged I mean you'll get discouraged but you will never give up so he knows you're not good enough and this is nothing that I guess live under the next slide this is what we call the tempted tortoise so now after the hare has left the tortoise he's waiting to bus later you'll never win and now the tortoise maybe becomes a little bit discouraged and he becomes tempted now here's what the devil starts to tempt him he's just started in this race this journey of a Christian life so that's what this is representing so in his Christian life as we all do we stumble when we start off we give our heart to the Lord and then maybe run off the back some temptation will come upon us or some some of the trial will go through and we just fall flat on our face yes it's the way of any Christian we just get up and rush yourselves often we keep right on going but that's not can ever give up so here's the temptations he faces so the devil tells me you're not good enough you're too dumb to understand the great mysteries The Tortoise knows he is not adequate he knows he must rely on God and this is a personal confession of mine I've always struggled with reading comprehension I can read something and when I get done I have no idea or what it's about than when I started I can't tell you anything about even with the Bible I've always been that way since I was 15 reading the Bible and and especially on the Old Testament stories I get so hung up like who's who and what's what what's happening and so I've always thought well I'm not going to give up I want to keep reading it until I do understand that's been my mentality about it I'm going to keep read and read read same thing with listening sometime this week Gaby's going to be watching this video and she's going to amend this I don't listen very good well to compensate for that go back and hear all the sermons and my schools anywhere from two to ten times as many times as I have to to begin to understand just the storyline not to give out I'm not trying to cram it into my heart is revelation I'm trying to soak in the field in the woman my mind so that it's available for God to pretty mature I'm not giving up and I'm not going to stop you can throw up your hand and say oh I'm too dumb I don't listen good and I'm not going to understand it and I don't have the reading comprehension you make all kind of excuses but at the end of the day you just keep going just keep on pressing because I find out about God honors our efforts and he knows where we are adequate enough where would not be no foreign acrobatic wa sees so he honored our efforts Hebrews 12 wherefore soon we are off also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith before the door that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and sat down at the right hand but it's not about so let us run with patience the race that is set before us and always looking to Jesus often depends for our faith that's what the torch had his honor he had his eye on the prize the whole time the finish line so when I think of The Tortoise and the hare I think of disciples of Christ I think of distant language I guess Katsopolis would work for Discipline disciple is a follower or student of a teacher a leader or philosopher my brother Bannerman looked in all kind of dictionaries try to find the definition I'm looking for and this is the closest one that I could find still exactly what I have them in mind of discipline but training that develops self-control strict control to enforce obedience orderly conduct the valves are not the source found to you they're a little closer to what I wanted order to practice self-control exercise this is one I added in there because I think it's appropriate self-denial when you're wanting to study and pray and seek God there's always distractions we'll never find time you have to make time and that's where that self-denial comes in I think of northen and Mary and the story I didn't get around to looking it up but Jesus I think of Mary the student at the feet of Jesus and listening to every word he said well Martha was cumbered about much serving Mary wasn't being lazy she was just putting aside her chores for daily activities team long enough to give time to God and that's all she was doing and that's what I saw God expects of us just give some time to God every day the marriage of the Lamb Esther was to become a bride so she didn't want none of the authority of the world she wanted to go in to the king just like she was she adorned themselves like the Pentecostal women ought to with a mate humble spirit but when all these fancy first ladies come by with all their new funding and then go things the King looked at them and put them in the chamber with the concubines but when this Esther come into this into his sight and he got a glimpse of that sweet humming spirit he said that's her go get the crown put on her head that's it let them adorn themselves with a kind of a spirit not only the women but the men to adorn themselves with that kind of a spirit then you become a ready for the bride sweet Reverend Esther make her heart clean regardless of our disposition you know the hair was inherently proud and haughty and and the tortoise not so much but it was more of a humble side the verb regardless of that you know we can choose humility regardless I don't think anyone's coming over the whole dog humility I think most of us have a lot of pride to start out with and we have to humble ourselves and we have to admit we're wrong we don't know everything so how's the picture that turned out so now on to the furtherance of the rest of the said earlier the hair gets real proud gets real lifted up in himself and said I can't film now here's how it compares to Christianity to Christians especially in commencing deliveries I made up this term I don't know if I've ever heard it used blanket salvation most everybody that I've seen in Christianity even in the message seem like they believe that salvation is a one-time thing that maybe when you were 12 you gave your heart to the Lord you name the experience you shout it but with tongues at 200 bucks cruise club-friendly our hair stood up whatever and all those things are good and can but and I believe they're of God the devil can't impersonate those but I like to believe those things the experience the attire of God but there has to be something after that there has to be a continuation a good scripture about that later but the terror believes in this blanket salvation or eternal security I gave a hard floor bla bla bla and here's what's the Tinker is today is I came with a seed in me I what's the thing wrote down always was eternal and all these things that I've seen personally that people believe maybe the ministers that believe those things still study to get a sermon but it's then like the layout teeth sort of sit down why would you keep studying and seeking God if you think you always was eternal and if you don't need anything if the race is run this over with and you're as good as done you're going to sit down and you're going to take it easy that's the problem that's why they say you always say yeah exactly and people believe these things and it actually causes them to stumble it than we even know it so I always had a scene in me and he gets this pride attitude of I deserve I deserve a break I deserve to sit down I deserve to rest a little while I know this because I've seen pride work in people very close family member that I've seen that quick on the church way reading the Bible with his marriage with his dog and all these things went off - now his life is in shambles and I watched it from the earliest starts of pride just in the most subtle form of Pride and watch how a canker had built and developed to what it is today is a terrible terrible thing it's very obviously what we're talking about her phone off humility we don't want to have the prize both of these guys had inherent flaws he wasn't good enough to run the race but he was relying on God he had flaws - but that didn't mean he couldn't make it I didn't mean he couldn't run the race here's the problem this is the biggest problem with the hare simple it's really simple he stepped out of the way I thought it did he was in the way of righteousness he was in the way that leads to salvation he was on the salvation Highway if you will Lenny stepped aside despite all of his pride and his flaws and his uh his misconceptions its false doctrine that we all come with he stepped out of the way he could have got rid of those and what happened he continued in the faith if he had not stopped God would have discerned those thoughts in his heart and took them away from him in time they were washed by the water of the word of studying and praying and seeking God and here in the work being creation what takes those things away things that we didn't even know we had that need to be dealt with it's just another picture of the same thing so he's sitting here in this flower bed of ease and he maybe sit down at first and he started meditating on these things these little clovers of always was eternal he meditates on on his little false doctrines of his and comforts himself cuz that's what his salvation is based on and he finds comfort and consolation in that instead of the Word of God do you think that the fact that he went to sleep yeah exactly because he got distracted with all those things and eventually went to a spiritual sleep he didn't know that he was plagued with these problems he thought he was going through he thought he was gonna make it but he was deceived and even if you are deceived as long as you stay in the way of righteousness just keep going don't ever stop no part of this lesson is don't stop that was the that was the objective to understand the importance of constant spiritual growth he never thought alright so there he is he's fallen asleep towards passed them by maybe the Lord didn't even notice him there but he just minds all business running his rest now there's an interesting picture on how well you can see that but this was the tortoise looks to he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake and that's the past that the hare stepped out of you notice in this picture these Shepherds are leaving these sheep of a treacherous path up a mountain of a stature perfect man he's going to take them to the very top if they'll keep following him but if they get out of the way they'll tumbled and fall down this mountain such a treacherous way if you get off to the side he stopped it's sanctification for any reason if you stop and you don't keep going all the way at the top of the stature Burton man you just stop anywhere you're gonna fall then you just keep on going to trust your Shepherd never never stop signal now what just out here let us all take you tonight Lord for I believe that it's time for us to take inventory checking up time but we don't know what time it's going to be checking out time it may be later than we think so let's consider our ways tonight and our thoughts I want a traditional network y'all it may not be there has he never heard the word fickle not a real common word heard fickle it's like a pickle whenever with that well here's a new we're fueling pickle it means changing frequently especially as regards to one's loyalties and pretty not constant or loyal and affectionate my generation is the most fickle life I've ever known but the second generation that I've known but anyway unless I read the history books but the fact is I've seen guys that I work with they're on there they've had all Thrones changing spouses and houses and phones and all these things can't keep one job in one house and what's bouncing and one phone number in bah-bah-bah I guess the change the phone number goes the creditors are chasing on whatever but Gregg phone brother Danny sister Joyce your walk back there one that's always been an example brother sister bill some family members of mine that are great aunt uncle and aunt and uncle live up in Hollywood Georgia side-by-side there in the first house that they moved into and they got they still got the pond behind the same cars still that same spouses so you know the same kids still got all the same stuff they're just keep on keeping on and that's why I say it's better we'll leave that early every guy born I mean people change the dogs every 10 minutes but to be that tourist you can't be fickle the hair is fickle he's easily swayed with every wind of false doctrine he's going over here things over here just every new move every new promotion and emotion and everything and a wise truck driver told me when we got married in 2007 what some of the wisest words were heard he said marriage is what you make of it instead of you in other word that's how he said to me but I meditate on that effort he said that to me I was really good marriage is what you make of it you're how so much may know that your life is what you might go and your job is what you make of it something will try to change their house and spouse and job and car and everything all the time trying to make them fit that person when maybe they need to change it right okay it's a simple one apply but it also pertains to what we're talking about [Laughter] did you know it is possible to not know what you believe it's kind of a tricky statement think about that did you know it is possible to not know what you believe really or that voters thought about them you can actually thank you believe and the oneness of the Godhead or you think you believe and you know all the things that we stand for a water baptism the name of Jesus Christ and all these things and you think you understand it and you do conceptually but has it been revealed it is possible to not know what you believe there's a cure for that there's a remedy you can't think you believe certain truths but in your heart is something contrary you can confess your beliefs but do you possess it in your heart at the revelation that's why so Bob and I use the word violets that pertains to life you know in spiritual life especially eternal life so vital to stay in the way to constantly follow below our data grow into the prayer meditation read and listen to the workout Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart we aren't worried about as long as we stay in the way you don't worry about what little doctrines you might have in your psyche that's floating around that you really believe and don't realize it because you as long as you stay in the way they'll discern are the thoughts of your heart and he will actually purify you from that thing you know to the process of sanctification he'll take that out and you'll come to it when the word is revealed to you you'll see that running away in opposition that thing that was a false doctor that you didn't even know you believed proverbs 23 eat now I'm not the bread of him that hath an evil eye neither desire thousands thanking me for as he thinketh in his heart so is he he didn't drink say the to be but his heart quickly the point is there as a man thinketh in his heart so is he at Corinthians 7:4 godly sorrow worketh repentance oh this is a lot of time under godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation on a journey like unto salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death okay so we're in a journey and if you have real got a big sorrow not just you say you're sorry for you're saying you come to Christ and name a word only and then you throw this blanket you say how a blanket salvation for the rest of my life I can do whatever I want you live like the devil smoking cuts and everything I know we're not doing that here but I'm just saying you know well we're maybe not doing it's going on with the Lord and that sort of a blanket salvation - you thought this blanket and say now say and whatever happens when when when your rapture come when the resurrection happens and the rapture comes and I'll go in because of this blanket salvation but godly sorrow made you always have this panic card all this awful understand will forgive me and and forgive me for the thing that I didn't even know I did wrong forgiving the thing that I believe that I don't even realize I believe and cleanse me from that for this is the next verse from a whole this self same thing that she saw it after a Gandhi sort what carefulness was the was the hair careful or was he sort of careless what carefulness it wrought in you gave what clearing of yourselves yea what indignation yea what fear I'm guessing Polynesians reference what vehement desire I don't think the hair had any Beland desire he was kind of going with the motions on the way of salvation and then he stepped up his side not for fell asleep so that's not any vehement desire getting what zeal gave what revenge you know the tourists had all these traits he kept on going and he wasn't gonna stop he was violent as a Christian he was vomit with you know voltar with God and all things you have to prove yourself to be clear this man all right so here we go again I'm the last little ray leg of the race okay and you noticed and this wasn't actually on the story that I read growing up and I don't feel better notice the picture of it like this before but they put a little heel little Mountain there towards the end of the race in areas fond of the stature of Herbert man and over here sleeps this little guy at the bottom of the hill maybe it faith or whatever you could say he's believing but you know he's he stumble or he's fell asleep and and this tortoise with this positive attitude optimistic he's continuing on and off the stature of Herbert and finish the race and this guy's sort of got this attitude that I'm waiting on him to catch up a lot of people have that month said that I came in years ago I had my experiences and I read that certain book and I already been there and I've done that and now I'm waiting on y'all to catch up well maybe you haven't really started you know get started acts 14 confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God not a flowery bed of ease but most tribulation enter into the kingdom of God colossal one and you that were sometimes elevated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now happy reconciled so here we were without all these we're alienated with false doctrine and unbelief we came here with sin we can't her and unbelief and enemies in your mind a carnal mind is enmity against God yet now I'm happy reconciled bring us back to Christ he did it not us we just continue in the way documented the stipulation I've been reconciled in the body of his flesh through the death this is like Romans what brother weighs bento man in the barn is flesh through death to present you holy humbling for man are fruitful in a side stipulation if if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which he have heard in which was preached to every creature which is under heaven were appalled minister so here's where the Portus resided but the hair didn't make it there he stopped attend stipulation he didn't go through stop oh he wakes up yeah so the hair awakens and also stories that I've heard of this including the one I heard growing up the hair awakens are the last minute tries to make it but it's too late the courtesans already finished the race now a couple more little slides that are these are good little points for that pertain to this a common saying in aviation is your attitude determines your altitude it's a clever little Sagan it's actually naturally true attitude and reference to an aircraft of any kind refers to its orientation it's on three axes all right it has a pitch axis the nose pitches up and down to climb or descend as a roll axis on which it banks to turn and it has the all axis on which it turns like this way but the most important one is that pitch axis keep the nose up but all these things determine the direction the plane will go if you pitch the nose up you're going to climb and you keep a positive attitude and life in anything pertains to life career finances marriage health and most of all spiritual walk your attitude determines your opportunity and all those things in positive attitude keep pressing the mark of the high calling especially in the spiritual law this is a god that they have remedy quotes a lot of camera who he is the disease David are like the way he stick and your affidavit I think like motivational speaker your attitude not your aptitude what determine your altitude aptitude is something like that pear is something like that it's the natural ability to do something he naturally had the ability to win that race so he was leaning on that anonymous attitude all right this is a truck driver thing here cross rose so when you come to a crossroads in life and anything the first thing to do and determine your desired destination which which where you want to wind up in at the very end study the road map the Bible the perilous road takes you there the most important thing is to stay on that grow no matter how slow you go to stay on the road you get to decide which character you would lady in this story of the parable of the tourists of the hair you can be the tourist or you can be the hair it's absolutely your choice God didn't make you one way you just have to go through life like that and and I've just it's a like a victim mentality like it's all the circumstances fault you know you need to decide and every day I tried to decide to be about toys and try to not be the hair every single day we have to decide that really simple so what exactly do we need to do I've got about three more slider things Bren can push out your friend that quote don't need to read all of it but push out everything you have made up because it's in you when you receive Christ drink and push out and now don't never be afraid to ask big things God wants you to ask the big things they don't want you to be a little petty and juvenile I want you to ask the big things that you're doing there before to make the big things is God revealed to me the silver seven weeks today on and all these great mysteries in your work because you can reveal it to me and in the meantime not going to stay like a lump on the bar but I'm going to go study it and like I said my last lesson I think you want to stem seals ring seal book to understand turn-taking research a good and so on so just keep studying if you don't understand it read it again and keep going don't ever be afraid ask for the big thing and this is one of the one I added question answers the only way the only thing you have to do it's fall in love with him and just go right on loving him yes if you really love the Lord you just won't stop and you know he asked me to drive on the truck at night and struggle with staying awake and have all these battles that I go through trying listen to sermons so I figure Wednesday night that was a choice I made they don't ask my wife to sit up late at night listening to sermons because she don't get a chance to during the day dealing with kids she chose to do that I never told her to and God didn't master it - there are certain things you can choose to do for Christ that you do out of love for him he didn't ask you to do but you do those things and love solves a lot of things but the Bob said Wednesday night talk about that coming up the gospel train things would have called it and said yes all the things that comes that are produced by that are automatic we just put the coals in the fire so what is drinking and pushing out what is putting coals in the fire maybe that's what I'm talking about just knock stop it don't even pray the meta title seeking God spend atomic war it looks like [Music]
