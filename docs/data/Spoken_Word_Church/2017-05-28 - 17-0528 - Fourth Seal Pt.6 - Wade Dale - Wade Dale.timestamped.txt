[0:00] from you for a moment we know what the
[0:04] characteristics of the 4c is this the
[0:06] Eagle are prophetic anointing of the
[0:09] holy oak right the horse with the pale
[0:14] horse which was mixed it's a mixed color
[0:16] and we understand that the underlying
[0:18] meaning to that is is that it takes
[0:21] justification sanctification and the
[0:23] baptism of the holy ghost mix together
[0:26] to bring the Word of God not just the
[0:29] Word of God in letter but the Word of
[0:31] God in power demonstration right the
[0:34] left side the Word of God lays
[0:35] everything we need we don't need
[0:37] anything else except the Word of God now
[0:40] it does take that eagle anointing to
[0:43] that's this is where I read between the
[0:45] lines right we have to be able to read
[0:48] between what it has to be like that
[0:49] onion field where you can where you can
[0:51] roll it back that's the same onion it
[0:55] looks just like the other layer but
[0:56] there is a difference in the layers I
[1:00] counted that treason they cut down 15
[1:03] it's either 66 to 70 years old I counted
[1:07] the Rings oh there's a tree felling down
[1:09] in yards oh I have another one cut down
[1:11] and I have arranged a three things like
[1:15] better and more progressed but where was
[1:17] this around well this was a sycamore
[1:19] holler so yes and I'll stop came up
[1:22] about this high low so where he came
[1:24] from
[1:24] i sat down and counted rings me then he
[1:26] was putting wood up while he went and
[1:28] dump the wood out in the truck or in the
[1:31] tractor oxygen counted around a point 66
[1:33] and 70 so that tree is almost the same
[1:36] ages today it started so I have 70 years
[1:40] old and that that what I'm telling you
[1:44] about that is let's see it takes that
[1:46] what it takes to reveal the age of that
[1:49] tree you can't do brain then and you
[1:51] honestly you gotta look then think some
[1:56] of them are just all bone touchable
[1:57] that'd be your to drive mm-hmm that was
[1:59] a year that was not much training buddy
[2:01] they will sound it was a
[2:02] or of inch and that was the year of
[2:05] growth a lot of rainwater growth and so
[2:08] the rain for this far apart but so many
[2:10] you see like two years in a row they
[2:12] were real close and then you see one big
[2:14] long gap
[2:15] well did I tell the history that's an
[2:17] underlying meaning of that tree that was
[2:19] been in the arts and we were
[2:21] children's friends able to steal them
[2:23] the Bible was written for the foundation
[2:25] of the world we know one thing for here
[2:28] and has not played itself out yet but it
[2:31] is the eternal Word of God because when
[2:33] we come down here into the permissive
[2:35] will die all we're doing is is we're
[2:38] taking this written word back to because
[2:42] remember Adam in the Garden of Eden
[2:45] didn't have a Bible he didn't need one
[2:47] he had the communication with God we'll
[2:50] talk about a little bit this afternoon
[2:51] here the communication with God that was
[2:54] so perfect that that if Adam said when
[2:57] stopped tree moon the nest that was
[3:02] nothing contrary to what God would see
[3:04] so I got that I had before the fall had
[3:08] complete control named all the animals
[3:10] and God never one time sending us no
[3:12] hold on a minute I don't think that's
[3:15] right no he had complete control right
[3:18] and then but we see though that he sold
[3:21] all that out for his wife and in fact
[3:26] where we are now worth this I will fall
[3:28] so God
[3:30] I think about it this morning it's not
[3:32] that God had to write the word he did
[3:34] have to write it because he knew we
[3:36] thought he wrote the word knowing with
[3:39] Paul he had this whole plan in his mind
[3:41] he knew we would bother and what we
[3:44] would need to get back in fellowship
[3:46] with one thing and that's so 66 books in
[3:49] that bottle that's the only way we can
[3:51] get back with God the only one
[3:53] all right now my god that and then with
[3:56] the 66 books of the Bible we are so
[3:58] fortunate to have all the commentaries
[4:02] of people passed and then we had gone
[4:06] bring a prophetic prophet here to fill
[4:10] in all the lights readjust the word yes
[4:13] I said read does not readjust the
[4:15] perfect part of the word but readjust
[4:17] the part that man had looked at
[4:18] everybody got that right he had to
[4:21] readjust that what bring us back to the
[4:23] faith of the fathers I thinking of them
[4:26] you take the magic stand up and if I
[4:29] were today go over to not to this church
[4:32] made you but go to a Baptist Church in
[4:35] and start preaching to them tell them
[4:37] say you know your father son Holy Ghost
[4:39] doctrine comfortably fit to hell mmm now
[4:42] how would that go but that's one program
[4:46] that he was preaching not to judge his
[4:49] people only right in the you know all
[4:52] denominational world what about a mass
[4:54] that will be he took he could say that
[4:56] because he what he he was a profane he
[4:59] could pray that Billy Graham would ever
[5:00] say that with his heart system all
[5:03] Robinson ever say that his court system
[5:05] now listen that not a sister that come
[5:07] from the pit the hell the doctrine did
[5:09] you hear he the doctrine did now there
[5:12] was many people baptized name called
[5:14] uncle don't go rewarding it right so you
[5:16] can't you got it ain't say well they
[5:18] were my best I was going to no no no
[5:20] they shifted that came from that
[5:22] doctrine came up out of hell
[5:24] what the devil the devil's when he
[5:26] brought that doctrine it wasn't not
[5:28] remember the number two spirit so the
[5:30] little is God in the devil so the devil
[5:32] got into people twisted the word and you
[5:37] know God didn't you know what a crisis
[5:39] to him he wrote everything in this word
[5:41] to leave us back to what the original
[5:45] foundation and then we'll talk about
[5:50] this afternoon because I believe that
[5:54] went it Adam has the book of the names
[5:59] of the redeemed
[6:00] right you have the book you have the
[6:04] intelligence to do it he had God's mind
[6:06] to be able to do to do that but the
[6:09] property God said that that was clouded
[6:12] our blackened or there was a cloud went
[6:14] over Adam so he couldn't remember
[6:16] everything
[6:17] this way why he took the ability for
[6:20] Adam to listen let's be real honest with
[6:25] each other from different growing
[6:28] experience with each other
[6:30] I see now I see now by the new birth I
[6:37] see now that I always was eternal back
[6:40] before foundation or I was in the mind
[6:42] of God I had to see him thought I was
[6:45] diseased I never was not a seizure like
[6:47] but remember that's what part that went
[6:52] away from Adam that's the part that went
[6:56] away from laughs okay and the advantage
[6:59] that well that got real man has been
[7:01] trying to bring us back to that listen
[7:05] that's what we're going back to the raft
[7:07] to the even life condition right so who
[7:11] was any I mean it wasn't even Adam and
[7:14] Eve the bride and the grid and this
[7:20] bride is going to have the same mind
[7:22] Instagram just like Eve and stay in line
[7:25] of the battle until what happened in the
[7:28] garden so now I can see my part of me
[7:32] has been enlightened you read the Bible
[7:35] talking about being enlightened
[7:37] we've been enlightened we've been the
[7:39] light that shone back to pass Genesis to
[7:42] tell us that that Justin's 1:26 manager
[7:44] I came from but it had to catch me down
[7:48] here because the Falls that rated okay
[7:52] and I was lost but in God's mind I never
[7:55] was because if he ever holds one thing
[7:57] against you and I was reading this
[7:59] morning we're brother Brown said if your
[8:02] name's not in the book you're never
[8:04] going to get so if your name was never
[8:07] any book you're never going to get me so
[8:10] Micah Pharisees he said their name was
[8:12] not the book
[8:13] do they conversation know if it's in a
[8:15] book but I'm going to the Brian section
[8:17] their name where you never in that book
[8:20] that part now and I
[8:23] got something many for later over
[8:24] brother Brown remember he said one time
[8:25] he said either when you come to
[8:28] sanctification he says your name goes on
[8:30] the book of the believer right I love
[8:34] your name was always written it it is
[8:37] written in eternal session but for a
[8:40] judgment purposes God had to allow that
[8:43] step to happen for here for here you go
[8:49] allow that where you can see that
[8:50] progress is your name is transferred now
[8:53] that's not angels up there transferring
[8:55] your name to me it's it's just symbolism
[8:58] it shows me that that everybody in the
[9:01] world has an opportunity to be say their
[9:04] name goes on the book as a believer
[9:06] exacta fication
[9:07] Jesus's name went on the book as a
[9:09] believer but he never went on to
[9:12] transfer that name to what the Lamb's
[9:15] Book of Life the one that God came to
[9:17] redeem but unless don't go so far
[9:21] because remember the lamb remains a
[9:25] foolish virgin who's not in Helen that's
[9:29] great people that's what we're coming up
[9:32] to in the fifth seal we're coming up to
[9:34] the grace that God had that goes way my
[9:37] my judgment your good yes because we saw
[9:40] it last look life that's all it is we're
[9:42] the bride we're in we're done no no if
[9:47] they had not done fall that's the way it
[9:49] would have been okay but now that the
[9:52] fall happened we see the full attribute
[9:56] of God come out that he can say whoever
[9:59] he will and their names can be
[10:02] transferred to a place wife upholding
[10:06] their and but that book of because
[10:08] remember when you come to judgment if we
[10:10] know there's not gonna be a book okay we
[10:12] know that but to for symbolism purposes
[10:15] that you get the people that are locked
[10:17] up you're going to flip the book open
[10:20] remember our names are not in that book
[10:25] our names are not in that revelation 20
[10:29] or 21 book but remember cuz we're doing
[10:33] a judge and why would we do any judging
[10:34] if we have a name in a judgement book in
[10:38] a bull of life our name is not only a
[10:42] man but some people's names are on there
[10:45] that God knew wouldn't go all the way to
[10:49] receiving your birth but they're still
[10:50] going to be judged with their deeds
[10:52] now that's where you got judgment for
[10:57] those people couple under my name
[10:59] Buddhist virgin ones that we're blinded
[11:02] and get to that later but I'm trying to
[11:05] give you something to look we and I do I
[11:07] try to sometimes make it so much to
[11:11] where look it's just
[11:12] is the bride and nobody else will guess
[11:15] what that is true to a point because I
[11:18] don't have another bride I got one and I
[11:21] think about her I don't think about
[11:22] nobody else's bride I think about my
[11:24] right right right
[11:25] so God have this brought out on his mind
[11:28] and he is they are going to be so close
[11:30] to him so they'll be one just like out
[11:32] of an evil one now didn't have another
[11:35] vision of another woman he was a nice
[11:39] wine that's when shoulders out he don't
[11:42] want nothing to happen to and then he
[11:45] won't have to have need and it was
[11:48] another less thing or a thorough sex I
[11:51] did love that it was it was really the
[11:54] mind of God still acting as the Savior
[11:57] but remember he could only save her two
[11:59] so far he really couldn't save her at
[12:02] all but he was what covering her what
[12:04] Christ are you not
[12:05] he covered us while we were in sin he
[12:08] kept us because he knew we would come to
[12:11] a place a Redemption yet I believe 100
[12:15] percent if you're born again you were
[12:17] given an angle that stayed with you from
[12:19] your birth to your new birth and
[12:22] continued on with you but definitely
[12:24] stake the glove if you supposed to come
[12:27] to here
[12:28] think about predestination now this is
[12:31] the freezer
[12:31] meaning of God there's nothing going to
[12:34] happen to you until you get to that
[12:37] point
[12:37] like I've always said about David David
[12:40] and like the part of people don't
[12:42] understand about David in life David
[12:45] believe that what Samuel said you will
[12:49] be kings of Israel he puts that down in
[12:52] his soul so deep I don't think he was
[12:55] arrogant because remember the Bible says
[12:57] that David was the apple of God's eye
[13:00] same way we're brother Brown my new you
[13:03] you know one thing for sure if God would
[13:05] give all that to someone else it went
[13:07] straight to their head but was way
[13:10] around he knew it was known as head he
[13:12] knew he'd be humble even though he was
[13:15] revealed the seven seals that were
[13:18] closed up before the foundation of the
[13:19] world God revealed them to a prophet and
[13:23] he still never got to be I'm not saying
[13:28] it didn't step out of line sure he made
[13:29] a mistake he said he did right right and
[13:33] then because he leaned toward that gift
[13:35] a lot he said angel don't you quit
[13:37] explaining again just use it in other
[13:39] words why you need to explain it but he
[13:41] was so he was so human till he wanted to
[13:44] by the sea he want people to see it he
[13:47] won't be able to see him he won't be
[13:49] able to see the Glide that was working
[13:50] through Trot the same way look with talk
[13:54] to Adam and Eve because we got to go
[13:56] back if this Adam and Eve in the garden
[14:00] then once it got to be what you got it
[14:02] was instead a return back to you because
[14:05] remember redemption is not replacement
[14:06] we fell from what the position they held
[14:10] right so we got to go back to that same
[14:13] tradition amen and we could see that
[14:17] Jesus showed some of it when he calmed
[14:20] the seeds in the water and all that we
[14:22] saw him brother Gregory calm storm and
[14:24] do plane like that but that the
[14:26] manifested sort of God that's something
[14:28] that God wants us to be complete control
[14:31] of the earth again
[14:34] and I believe we will be right I believe
[14:38] we will be will will rule and reign with
[14:41] him out of that city for an eternity now
[14:49] that's the bright part that's the part
[14:51] that is so special that the bright part
[14:54] but now see then we would take that box
[14:57] and everybody else's do but no there's
[15:02] going to be 10,000 little people outside
[15:04] the city than they are inside the city
[15:06] they just won't be able to come in the
[15:08] city and reside they will come into the
[15:10] city the Bible says and Keynes so there
[15:13] must be some kind of system there's good
[15:17] Kings
[15:18] there's Kings out there that's going to
[15:21] come in the Bible said take a leaf off
[15:23] symbolism it's symbolism taking the leap
[15:27] off the tree I'm going to make these but
[15:30] it's going to show that everything's
[15:31] piece was just showing that Joel
[15:33] everybody hey this is God in his bride
[15:37] and we have been blessed with great so
[15:41] much to wait to live here for an
[15:43] eternity no so see how the expanding of
[15:47] God it would be it would be a really
[15:48] narrow God if we just stayed the garden
[15:50] without money and the bribes that'd be
[15:52] just about it you know that would be too
[15:54] narrow
[15:56] no look once I start I was thinking last
[15:59] night look what he's allowed billions of
[16:02] people come serve billions there's seven
[16:05] billion now so many hundred thousand are
[16:07] dying sowing our thousand for being born
[16:09] so there's a rotation of you know
[16:13] there's probably 50 or 80 billion people
[16:16] that's build here since the beginning of
[16:17] town look at all that they got to go
[16:20] somewhere right this is it they got to
[16:23] go somewhere and I can't just be but I
[16:25] was talking to
[16:29] oh I come to Anderson and Emma they're
[16:33] cutting the grass 30 and Friday
[16:37] there's people born on this earth this
[16:39] just hearing skin that's all they are
[16:43] they're going to be judged and their
[16:45] soul just going to die don't even though
[16:49] they even though they what we say burn
[16:52] in hell is not eternal one day people on
[16:56] this earth are just gonna vanish they
[16:58] came here because of what for what
[17:00] happened to Adam and Eve it put that
[17:02] other covenant I was thinking of the day
[17:04] I went to the end of school and a little
[17:09] boy there that was a little bit
[17:11] retarding you know I mean it's faced
[17:13] with a little bit distorted and I felt
[17:17] God that's our Father that is not your
[17:21] fault that's man's fault the genetics of
[17:24] this one genetics of this one hey take a
[17:26] proper road browser that came from the
[17:28] grandparents epilepsia all this genetic
[17:32] coming down to mating Brenda centuries
[17:35] has produced all this junk sell
[17:39] the other stuff there's no we call mom
[17:43] boy but down center is known that in
[17:45] heaven there's none of that in God's
[17:47] mind there's none of that man produced
[17:49] that right man
[17:51] is what produced that man is black the
[17:54] the male DNA and the female DNA of what
[17:57] come to this earth has caused all this
[18:00] one because they came from atoms I read
[18:02] it last night in the reading inside the
[18:03] atom see kalinda beer atoms natural
[18:07] normal seed is what the wind is this
[18:09] earth imagine
[18:12] there was nothing right just about Adams
[18:15] natural seed so they caused death
[18:18] it caused death I don't care who you are
[18:21] I don't matter me who you had called
[18:23] death it did not talk like the only seed
[18:26] that ever caused life cause life is the
[18:30] spoken word when Jesus hit the earth and
[18:33] start speaking for three to five years
[18:35] and all this Bible was written because
[18:37] that's what brings life the spoken word
[18:40] program that is the original seed okay
[18:48] we're talking about a man this seed but
[18:51] he was all of the earth and it wasn't
[18:54] until he becomes deluded that all of
[18:58] this stuff started coming down so where
[19:00] does happen had to do a pickup he went
[19:03] into the full moon they took yeah he /
[19:06] to cook what she gave him our offer
[19:09] handful okay seeing that and he said
[19:12] well that's horrible out could have just
[19:14] said if it was if animal someone's God
[19:16] he just say food give me another one guy
[19:20] but you couldn't need to killing itself
[19:22] yeah you'd be killing itself that's why
[19:25] I'm just talking this is what I'm
[19:26] talking about now if Christ had become
[19:28] the bride will deny the bride would have
[19:31] died it he didn't come down here now
[19:33] what about a guard to die are gonna die
[19:36] yes didn't happen never in his whole
[19:40] psyche is he there right but he had to
[19:43] enter enter death just like that update
[19:45] don't you think Jesus now know Jesus
[19:47] didn't know who he was until he came up
[19:49] to her let's don't get let's do your
[19:51] thing close to the end of his life he
[19:55] knew he was going to have to die right
[19:57] now he have to get after these are not
[20:03] he could have turned all that around but
[20:04] now eventually that body would have died
[20:06] but he died willingly for you that's the
[20:10] same thing will Adam now Adam didn't die
[20:12] that day
[20:15] because remember the bosses the day you
[20:17] eat thereof so Adam lived 950 some years
[20:20] he almost lives long
[20:21] live with it we leave no humping some
[20:24] years why did not live that day that
[20:26] we're looking at the thousand-year
[20:28] millennium that we're looking at he they
[20:29] lived that day he died he was under
[20:33] death but look where he came from though
[20:35] men to live nine hundred some years did
[20:37] you imagine nine hundred years back
[20:41] there was basically maybe a little bit
[20:47] of China no other country was developed
[20:50] nine hundred years ago I mean you go
[20:54] down here you go thousand years back so
[20:56] this is 2017 you go to what 101 seven
[21:03] you'd be in the human forward at the
[21:09] dark ages
[21:10] yeah and you still be alive up there you
[21:13] see what brother brother I grasped at
[21:15] one time he said God knows you shouldn't
[21:18] live that long he said look at the
[21:19] strain you'd be under look at the
[21:21] difference you see from from right up
[21:23] from right here to here yeah all right
[21:27] so I why I said okay other years you're
[21:30] going to be about somewhere in there you
[21:32] know 120 then down to 70
[21:34] ma'am living a little bit longer now but
[21:37] see this is to me the essence of the
[21:38] seal shows us all of our life it shows
[21:43] you why things happen even the horrible
[21:46] you come in here having to endure
[21:49] through death and through life and
[21:50] through losing loved ones and gang in
[21:53] London and money and going you all that
[21:57] but this some point to do bills carrier
[21:59] yeah it feels your cat comes remember
[22:03] we're gonna talk about Saturday I able
[22:06] to in came with two different people
[22:08] there was two different spirits no I
[22:11] think spirits my soul now the house all
[22:13] right man has salt man God salt
[22:17] alright but what does what happened will
[22:21] read what brother Brown fit them to
[22:22] spirits because remember that's what's
[22:23] the name of it so it's gonna be just
[22:25] after noon go to spirit started in the
[22:27] garden you can't
[22:28] rooo came enabled what happening it was
[22:34] Cain and Abel and then oh well the
[22:37] property I don't have to say you have to
[22:38] agree with me you but you disagree
[22:40] within those two spirit started there
[22:42] and they go all the way he said to Jesus
[22:45] returned all the ways of Jesus return
[22:51] need content for and got supposed to cut
[22:55] a tree down it grandma now tomorrow in a
[23:02] basil three huh
[23:03] that's why I told him I did you guys get
[23:05] a name for your free cutter April ground
[23:07] solo but the two spirits go all the way
[23:12] down
[23:13] start the agendas all the way down we
[23:16] run around when I was going to read this
[23:17] epidemic we get to it remember Turk a
[23:19] bookie said what when the brackets of
[23:21] Revelation of the two spirits in the
[23:23] framework of church you be an invincible
[23:26] army that's a problem those two seats
[23:27] are so close together or few spirits are
[23:29] so close together now to the law most
[23:31] deceive us sitting here on combat
[23:34] sitting in your life and my life that
[23:36] gets kind of home done it pull put it
[23:38] out
[23:38] Norris can able ok but Jordan a man able
[23:43] to Samantha maintains if you want it but
[23:47] the seals to me though revealed from
[23:49] Genesis to revelations the sealed is the
[23:52] greatest revelation yet it's the most
[23:54] simple it tells you but what they tell
[23:56] you how to live yeah tell you how little
[23:59] you know it doesn't mean oh it also
[24:01] tells me while ain't nothin I like to
[24:04] know the why don't just tell me go do
[24:06] that
[24:07] well now tell me why I need to do it and
[24:08] then maybe I can do it with an open
[24:10] heart and be able to understand why I'm
[24:12] doing this you don't know explain to me
[24:15] why explain why I gotta go visit them
[24:17] well God's come down and he's explained
[24:19] it nuts like I said like Sunday there's
[24:21] no other way could explain he said he
[24:24] said 66 books of the Bible he said the
[24:28] bottle probably pastors teachers in
[24:29] evangelists and this is the way it's
[24:31] gonna be
[24:32] they have no new Bible there's no you
[24:35] probably coming
[24:37] listen both we have come to the honing
[24:39] part because look Martin Luther John
[24:43] Wesley's a left-wing sentence what for
[24:45] someone else to come in it goes up and
[24:48] home the bride with it we don't have
[24:52] nobody else Jesus Christ is here on the
[24:54] earth and it's bright through fivefold
[24:57] ministry and we're looking for one thing
[24:59] I added that in man because I'm going
[25:01] with preaching on the rapture why why
[25:09] don't need preach on record why we gotta
[25:13] get this thing comes around first a
[25:15] rapture is attaching the way arrived for
[25:17] sure is a process I know that but a
[25:20] rapture is a one-time event don't
[25:24] catching away Bible doesn't drop by
[25:27] rapture this probably catch with big
[25:29] hops a lot of that resurrection if I get
[25:32] it there's names on the groundwork
[25:34] before there is interaction all right
[25:37] Khalid I'll look if you want the book we
[25:39] gotta find the voice of the resurrection
[25:41] and just so these two have been named so
[25:45] or we shall have to you say well we know
[25:47] the name Jesus Christ do we really know
[25:50] when that name is spoke what's behind
[25:52] that name it's the life behind the name
[25:55] makes the demons tremble yeah you say
[26:00] he's described all your life people do
[26:02] it now in Bulgaria okay but you said the
[26:05] right way guess what comes does the
[26:07] regulation come he said how did you know
[26:11] that he told you he said I am the
[26:14] resurrection and the light who said of
[26:17] that the Lord Jesus Christ that's one
[26:20] that name had to be brought back that's
[26:22] one of the name has to come back here
[26:23] the program talks about a name he said
[26:26] finally they named this that this person
[26:28] doesn't help
[26:29] I then his name that settled him with
[26:32] them so now we have a new name now
[26:37] father no those not not Lord one person
[26:40] and father's one person and sons of that
[26:42] person no
[26:44] one man was standing there when he said
[26:47] I am the resurrection II and say my
[26:49] father because we don't worry father
[26:50] what he says I am why the father never
[26:58] needed a reference right the son of God
[27:03] never died yeah I remember into that
[27:06] many times the prompt o son of God never
[27:08] died
[27:08] the storm and I cried but the son of man
[27:12] is the one that got resurrected so
[27:14] that's why the Son of Man message has
[27:16] got to be back in full power in the end
[27:20] time the Lord Jesus cars God in human
[27:24] flesh and the word was made flesh so
[27:27] that has to be transferred miss Eve or
[27:31] miss Jesus Christ to you not yes yes
[27:35] taken to the other day - my name look at
[27:40] the great thing that and nobody here in
[27:44] his church don't tell anybody here but I
[27:47] hate hyphenated last name yeah Jim
[27:51] Thomas died yeah Thomas was the slack
[27:54] you know the little more than their
[27:55] income are showing so far
[28:00] she not gonna be my head all
[28:05] you know we are we are mrs. Lord Jesus
[28:11] Christ because if you put a hibernation
[28:14] in there who you put in there I know the
[28:17] person yeah because the person of jim
[28:20] Dale LAX's unit never last name so Jim
[28:24] promises her whole name but Jim Thomas
[28:28] is no more now the living person she's
[28:31] up listen please don't deny you don't
[28:35] deny your family Eugene Thomas is still
[28:40] my father alone here Thomas but I'm not
[28:42] married to him right I'm not here there
[28:45] I am the head of Jim now dead comments
[28:50] alive day remember that's what the
[28:53] property guard said when you when you he
[28:55] takes the battle off of you you sure
[28:57] entered everything to help
[28:58] you sure entered everything why you
[29:01] surrendered your name your dad your dad
[29:04] you don't go back to that name not sure
[29:06] a weakness naturally we know that but
[29:08] look spiritually fiercely you can't
[29:10] trade even the Bible tells us in the
[29:13] book of revelations that you have a name
[29:15] that you live in by but you're dead what
[29:17] the denominations hyphenated their last
[29:20] name yes why you know what they put
[29:34] right
[29:36] their mission is Jesus Christ - amen
[29:39] they're mrs. Jesus drive tapenade and
[29:42] how to make messes what because they
[29:44] take a hit ship of that Baptist Church
[29:46] room after the church over then ship of
[29:48] Jesus Christ
[29:49] now you stop that that was fun I'm going
[29:53] to use that but look we're midgets Jesus
[29:57] Christ nor it's not right now that is
[30:05] something else gonna be coming back
[30:08] there happening today a man to connect
[30:13] their self back to a man sample rub out
[30:17] that there's only one ms g ms jesus
[30:20] christ not hyphenated and that's why he
[30:23] talked about their two-spirit cuz hook
[30:25] you got one here here which is righteous
[30:27] and then you got one spirit here which
[30:29] is you save you money and that's a trade
[30:36] you have a name that you live by
[30:39] but your day it's my life not Monday
[30:43] night I didn't want to dismantle by no
[30:49] one husband while so you not fully
[30:52] surrendered and that's what the Badgers
[30:53] they not they can okay I'll take you so
[30:55] far but we don't keep this father son
[30:57] Holy Ghost baptism we don't keep this
[30:59] Trinitarian doctrine we don't keep this
[31:01] we don't keep there and that's what Cain
[31:03] said will comes out this afternoon chain
[31:06] and it does word of God just like his
[31:12] daddy did or Satan through the beach
[31:17] good trip listen let's don't get
[31:18] technical canes father was the Beast see
[31:24] ya
[31:25] but the nature he got was from safe yeah
[31:30] just like me you've got the same one
[31:32] that what we gotta get it we got that
[31:34] okay and part we got to get rid of will
[31:38] rain a brother Adam really explained to
[31:39] them once message I will restore I think
[31:41] it is and about the two because he said
[31:45] that started the two three was Cain and
[31:49] Abel Cain's doctrine and Cain's doctrine
[31:53] is what killed me
[31:56] Bentley and that's what's been killing
[31:58] all down through the ages this maintains
[32:00] doctrine the two spirits then you come
[32:03] down to east on and Jacob you come down
[32:05] to Jesus in Jesus and you come down now
[32:07] to thee I don't want to say the message
[32:09] because it's in the message to I want to
[32:13] say the two spirits in the framework of
[32:16] a message Church one just as righteous
[32:20] and the other to a degree but they're
[32:22] going to turn one word down right
[32:24] there's like Satan added one word that
[32:28] same nature is still going to be there
[32:29] to either add some or take away from it
[32:32] and we know it I model says about that
[32:34] so now we come in the fourth seal the
[32:38] poor seal is the rapture seal this wind
[32:40] is to going up now you can say that
[32:42] because there's a end of the fourth seal
[32:43] the rapture takes place right now you
[32:47] can tip it inside all that or seal
[32:49] between the first seal all the way down
[32:52] is going to come a resurrection yeah and
[32:55] the reason it come is because of the
[32:59] next one do we talk about five six seven
[33:05] okay so we're going to split this these
[33:10] are all in yourself
[33:16] right you're not justified you flex
[33:20] right you know your science fair just
[33:24] fighting so you're not born again in
[33:27] your spirit you're borrowing it in
[33:30] yourself your body is just a vehicle to
[33:35] keep this thing together and it only
[33:37] does what we tell it for this what we
[33:39] inside of us tells it to do so what are
[33:42] we going to look down here we're going
[33:43] to look at the spirit and the body and
[33:47] we're going to connect them together
[33:49] because the body only does what the
[33:51] spirit fills it today I've always said
[33:55] your shoulders are real you your spirit
[33:58] remember even when you come into you by
[34:01] that body is no more than an animal I
[34:04] read it to you like Sunday it's animal
[34:07] brother on set in the womb of a woman is
[34:11] a flesh that is Wiggly muscles is all
[34:18] the city said there is no soul there's
[34:21] nothing to that that's just like an
[34:23] animal what book it but it's beginning
[34:26] it's beginning to be something yet
[34:28] because see your soul is your fire
[34:29] mechanism you saw this what really these
[34:31] done inside sure you can suppress this
[34:33] you can do this bubble I mean we get
[34:36] real technical but your soul is program
[34:38] said is the real you all right the real
[34:41] you but now you have to remember and
[34:46] let's get a little technical here
[34:48] there's a spot for that soul can't cross
[34:58] when our it
[35:03] triangle thing happenin guard
[35:13] you don't do that in your soul God never
[35:18] had a relationship with anyone in that
[35:22] way even brother Brennan said hey you
[35:26] say marry for this a he said you're
[35:29] having guard making relations with with
[35:31] merit you see how far he separated that
[35:34] son right you got me yeah cuz your soul
[35:37] never did any of that that's why I've
[35:41] been saying the soul
[35:42] he let his spiritual nature and take
[35:49] hold and then his body and all of you
[35:54] don't I go to church what is it problem
[35:59] anyway but she won't talk about so
[36:03] there's there's something that we got to
[36:05] get back the web at the Cardo line the
[36:07] Bible says this what enmity with God is
[36:10] a division yes but now remember what I
[36:13] just wrote down there is not wrong in
[36:17] our condition that we're in now because
[36:19] we have to do that to survive Yeah right
[36:22] there
[36:23] maybe if it was that
[36:29] I'm a little a little bit later come on
[36:31] let me go but your soul is pure if
[36:36] you're born again listen your soul can't
[36:38] have one mark against it that's what
[36:41] probably got there not one mark maybe
[36:44] you have in yourself try programs you
[36:46] don't even love with yourself you love
[36:50] your fear because remember and out here
[36:53] you've got what I was telling y'all deal
[36:54] today
[36:55] you got filial love but that soul right
[36:59] here that's adopted love that's a love
[37:01] that you never we don't understand that
[37:03] how love you we don't understand that
[37:06] kind of love yet and that's what this
[37:08] love right here not not love me does he
[37:10] know no that agape love one time grows a
[37:14] bunch of people out of a temple for
[37:16] doing the things wrong he's doing there
[37:18] one day and he said he's going to bury
[37:20] his family let the dead bury the dead
[37:22] comes over me yes yes no one said that
[37:25] was a doctor but that was that Jesus
[37:27] Christ was the epitome he would be a
[37:29] that he is agape
[37:31] so whatever his condition was now part
[37:34] from the eatin and you know being a
[37:37] human but there I thought they love is
[37:41] what we got to get back to and let it
[37:45] speak from down in the soul I'm telling
[37:48] you that's our problem we have it with
[37:49] our soul is enough we have bound it by
[37:54] our nature even the good even being born
[37:58] again we bound it by our nature that's
[38:00] why this thing right here unbinds it
[38:02] this is what I'm fine this doesn't
[38:04] unbind your soul your soul born again
[38:08] around here is just trying to get out
[38:12] it's trying to get to where it can
[38:14] operate like it did with Adam but we got
[38:19] to go reverse right we are no reverse
[38:24] because they love it for the
[38:26] the place that's that's right coming up
[38:28] to the profession of the spirit man
[38:30] which works its way out into the flesh
[38:32] all right because remember the flesh
[38:34] this there's no dominant flesh there's
[38:36] no patience is blessed
[38:38] there's no temperance in flesh your
[38:41] temper comes from what's inside you not
[38:43] this man he just tells you to follow
[38:46] your fifty study it just tells you what
[38:48] to say right so the body really for me
[38:52] that's what they're always the body is
[38:54] canceled out the body to me is canceled
[38:58] left it has nothing to do with my
[39:00] Redemption but it is redeemable because
[39:05] of what Christ did at Calvary because
[39:06] when he came up in that resurrection I
[39:09] was in you were in him all right Justin
[39:14] one point six men was in that land so
[39:15] whatever he had the property guys did we
[39:18] get two errors in joy narrative he get
[39:21] the body change we get money - right
[39:23] right men until - you're that sure
[39:26] that's what we're coming to we'll come
[39:27] to a resurrection but to get that
[39:30] resurrection we got to look at the fifth
[39:32] seals itself and obviously the seventh
[39:35] seal covers all the way back right what
[39:37] are hold about that this afternoon as
[39:39] far as the opening of the book and the
[39:41] sealing of the book text article
[39:44] you
[39:46] [Music]
