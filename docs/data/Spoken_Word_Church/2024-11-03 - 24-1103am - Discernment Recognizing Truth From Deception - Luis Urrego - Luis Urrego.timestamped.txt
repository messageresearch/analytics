[0:16] not exactly what I wanted but it's you
[0:19] guys see it so we're trying to work it
[0:22] to where presenter view so where I can
[0:24] see certain notes on my end but you're
[0:27] just seeing the slides and and can't
[0:30] seem to get that working so but anyways
[0:34] um well I want to talk this morning
[0:36] about uh discernment and I want to uh
[0:40] recognizing truth from deception how
[0:42] many believe that we live in an age
[0:44] where you need to have
[0:46] discernment I mean you need to have
[0:48] discernment uh uh definitely
[0:51] spiritually
[0:53] politically you need to have discernment
[0:55] in every area of your life
[0:57] financially uh it's an age uh
[1:00] you know it's an age of deception and
[1:03] and and it so much of an age of
[1:05] deception that Jesus said that it could
[1:08] deceive the very elected if it was
[1:10] possible that's how close things are so
[1:13] if it's like that in the spiritual then
[1:15] how much more in the in the natural
[1:18] right and so that's what kind of what we
[1:20] want to talk about this morning so let's
[1:22] just bow our heads real quick Lord Jesus
[1:24] we appreciate Lord God your your word
[1:27] father and thank you Lord God for the
[1:28] opportunity that you give us Lord to to
[1:31] look at your word and to and to speak
[1:33] about it Lord and I pray that you'd
[1:35] bless us through your word Lord God and
[1:36] we just Commit This Time into your hands
[1:38] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen
[1:42] so in Hebrews
[1:45] 5:14 it says but strong meat belongeth
[1:48] to them that are full age I know you
[1:50] can't see that there but I'm just
[1:51] reading it to you even those who by
[1:53] reason of use have their senses
[1:55] exercised to discern both good and evil
[1:59] and I think it's very very important in
[2:01] the hour that we live in that we just
[2:03] not take everything for face value right
[2:07] you can't do that you really can't do
[2:09] that you have to be Discerning and
[2:12] sometimes people might think well your
[2:14] your cup is always half uh either half
[2:16] full or or what what is it half
[2:19] empty some people are made
[2:21] different some people look at people or
[2:24] and their intentions in a different way
[2:27] uh maybe some uh I think we should
[2:30] always give people the benefit of Doubt
[2:32] however in the age that we're living in
[2:34] it's just so deceiving that you can't
[2:36] really do that especially not online so
[2:40] you can't do that with people online so
[2:43] uh and so that's that's that's what we
[2:46] sort of want to tie it in and in 1 John
[2:48] 4:1 it says beloved believe not every
[2:52] Spirit but try the spirits whether they
[2:55] are of God because many false prophets
[2:58] are gone out into the the world Amen so
[3:02] the importance uh to discern uh which
[3:05] discernment is one of the spir
[3:07] non-spiritual gifts and uh I believe
[3:10] that God gives us all a level of
[3:12] discernment naturally physically but
[3:16] there are levels of discernment where
[3:17] you where they're they're higher than
[3:21] others just because it's a gift that's
[3:23] that's given to you so uh it's it is a
[3:25] spiritual gift so the importance of of
[3:28] to discern what is true from false
[3:32] cannot be
[3:33] overstated because look how John John
[3:36] says it here beloved he's not talking to
[3:38] the world he's not talking to to people
[3:40] who don't go to church he's talking to
[3:42] Christians he said beloved believe not
[3:45] every
[3:47] Spirit believe not every Spirit but try
[3:50] the spirits amen it it it's a it's a
[3:54] commandment to all Christian Believers
[3:57] try to try every Spirit you have to be
[4:00] Discerning of every spirit that comes uh
[4:04] whether it's behind the pulpit or
[4:06] whether it's in your physical life amen
[4:09] what is it that the people or this
[4:11] person is trying to bring out to me you
[4:13] need to discern amen and that's why it's
[4:16] so important for us to to to get in the
[4:19] word and to be in the word and to know
[4:21] what the word says so that you can
[4:24] discern what the brother behind the
[4:25] pulpit is saying right or what the
[4:28] person you know is that that you're
[4:30] talking to is is is trying to tell you
[4:33] because there are people that are out
[4:35] there to push their own agendas uh and
[4:38] and they they have ways to do it uh that
[4:43] they can get in your head so good that
[4:46] it that you everything that you learned
[4:48] all your life that you've been in the
[4:50] message you'll be out there following
[4:53] that just like that because it sounds so
[4:55] good and that's the exact reason why you
[4:58] know Eve was deceived because whatever
[5:01] the the the the Satan was trying to
[5:03] bring or the or the or the uh serpent
[5:06] was trying to bring to her he got to her
[5:08] head he made sure that he knew that she
[5:12] knew that he was an a a reliable
[5:16] source right and so so that's why she
[5:19] was deceived and it takes time you know
[5:22] discernment or or or people that deceive
[5:25] usually the good ones are the ones who
[5:27] actually wait and they take their time
[5:31] they take their time with you those are
[5:33] the good ones the ones that try to just
[5:36] come at you and and and ask you for
[5:37] money can I have some money those are
[5:40] probably you most of us can can probably
[5:43] not you know we we can look at those and
[5:45] really discern those but it's the ones
[5:47] that actually work with you and take
[5:49] time those are the ones and that's how
[5:51] Satan Works Satan is not a fool he takes
[5:55] time to work with people because he
[5:57] knows that eventually he'll he'll be
[5:59] able to get get them now so how how do
[6:02] we start Discerning properly in 1 Peter
[6:05] 5 says says this be sober be vigilant
[6:10] because your adversary the devil as a
[6:13] royal lion walketh about seeking who he
[6:16] may devour now this is what we have to
[6:18] do how to start Discerning properly
[6:20] first you be sober amen and sober is I
[6:24] had the definition here in in the notes
[6:26] but it it's it's knowing or being awake
[6:30] being being alert you know when you say
[6:32] hey he's sober she's sober that means
[6:35] they're not drunk right that means
[6:37] they're not under the influence of
[6:39] something else but you are under the
[6:41] influence of the word amen be sober
[6:44] right be alert be alert be vigilant
[6:47] that's the next thing to do that's
[6:49] that's what that that which kind of
[6:51] means the same thing you know be
[6:53] vigilant always looking out it always
[6:55] reminds me of the of the of the people
[6:57] in the in the towers you know when they
[6:59] were look out the Lookouts you know
[7:01] they're always Vigilant why because
[7:05] they're making sure that the enemy amen
[7:07] doesn't get too close to them or they
[7:09] can see them way before the actual the
[7:12] enemy gets near the towers right and so
[7:16] you don't want to wait until the enemy
[7:19] amen comes right there to you at your
[7:21] Tower he might not be in the gates yet
[7:23] of the of the Kingdom but if he just
[7:25] gets right there to the Watchtower he's
[7:27] gotten too close right and so the
[7:29] Watchtower has to make sure that he sees
[7:31] the the the enemy coming in from way far
[7:35] so that's what vigilance means you have
[7:37] to always be vigilant in in in in the
[7:40] day that we're living in right and then
[7:43] you have to know your
[7:45] enemy look what look what Peter says
[7:47] here because your adversary the devil as
[7:51] a roaring lion walketh about seeking who
[7:54] he may devour now I was looking at this
[7:58] very interesting the way Peter mentions
[8:01] says it here because he says your
[8:03] adversary the devil as a roaring lion
[8:07] and you think you would think that a
[8:09] roaring lion um a lion he's very crafty
[8:14] he's very cunning and he and he's very
[8:17] sneaky when he's trying to get his prey
[8:20] however he is he does get his prey that
[8:22] way but you have to also realize that
[8:25] when a lion roars and if he's roaring in
[8:28] front of his in front of his prey that
[8:31] Roar paralyzes
[8:33] them because he get he lets them know
[8:36] that he has dominance over over that
[8:39] prey and therefore it's easier for them
[8:41] to snatch to for for him to snatch his
[8:44] prey so that is what That's what Satan
[8:48] does he exercises his power in that way
[8:52] because he constantly bombards you with
[8:55] all kinds of things in your head all
[8:57] kinds of things out here physically
[9:00] constantly bombarding he's constantly
[9:02] roaring and if you are not careful amen
[9:05] you will be paralyzed by the culture of
[9:07] the day and you will be deceived and and
[9:10] gotten gotten taken for everything that
[9:13] comes that comes at you
[9:15] so so that's what that's what Satan does
[9:17] he is a roaring line walketh about
[9:20] seeking who he may devour and the Bible
[9:23] says and it continues to say whom resist
[9:26] steadfast in the faith and no KN that
[9:29] the same afflictions are accomplished in
[9:34] your brethren that are in the I have it
[9:37] I guess I missed in the world I think is
[9:41] what it
[9:42] says all
[9:44] right now sometimes it's hard to
[9:47] pinpoint who the enemy
[9:49] Isen it's easy if we see a a a a devil
[9:52] out there with horns and and and and
[9:55] slobber coming down his face and and
[9:58] it's very easy you you know anybody can
[10:00] say that that's a deceiver right there
[10:02] but the deceiver comes in a way that you
[10:05] don't know that he's a deceiver right
[10:08] amen so just uh you know I work in the
[10:10] in the internet on the internet I'm
[10:13] always on the internet there's several
[10:15] Brothers here that we work together and
[10:16] we're always amen one of the main things
[10:21] that we that we that we have to look at
[10:24] is Security in in the workplace uh
[10:27] online and um
[10:30] and it's being stressed even further
[10:33] further in the last couple of years more
[10:36] than any other time so what they do is
[10:38] they'll send out they'll send out like
[10:41] uh campaigns of emails to all of the
[10:44] employees and it pretends like it's
[10:47] coming from the from the boss the email
[10:49] is coming from the boss and it has some
[10:51] sort of link you know hey the boss is
[10:53] trying to he's trying to share this file
[10:55] with you you know make uh look at it
[10:58] make sure you know because it's it's a
[11:00] deadline that you need to meet or
[11:02] whatever and you look at it and it looks
[11:04] so so like so real I mean the the the
[11:07] the campaigns that they keep giving us
[11:09] more and more they look more and more
[11:10] real Richard you probably get
[11:13] them and so and some of us we've fallen
[11:16] for for some of those we'll click on the
[11:18] link and if if you if you click on it
[11:20] then you have to take a little course
[11:21] you know you you have
[11:23] to and it's for you and that's your
[11:26] punishment right that's your punishment
[11:28] because you clicked on the link right
[11:30] all right it it might say your boss's
[11:33] name but if you don't recall that at all
[11:37] hey what file are you talking about what
[11:40] the best thing to do you they teach you
[11:42] look at the email address right look and
[11:45] see where it's coming from look at look
[11:47] at certain aspects of the email right
[11:50] they're training you right they're
[11:52] training you and then the next best
[11:55] thing to do is actually email your boss
[11:58] or call him say hey did you just send me
[12:00] something no I didn't okay then this is
[12:04] a test and I can just delete this right
[12:09] but hey it it is so close that it has
[12:12] even deceived I've had to do the little
[12:14] training two times already in the past
[12:16] five
[12:18] years and I'm on the internet all the
[12:22] time and and so that's how that's how
[12:25] deceiving it is but they do it they do
[12:27] it because they're training us now
[12:28] that's that's what the Lord is trying to
[12:30] do to us when we have to make sure hey
[12:35] the word says this here the word says
[12:37] this here let how do we connect this but
[12:39] then this brother behind the pulpit is
[12:41] saying this right now you all have been
[12:45] here you know Nanny you've been here for
[12:48] a long time and you know that we've been
[12:50] trained well in the word here right but
[12:53] still you know in the hour that we
[12:56] liveing because you can't let that you
[12:59] can't say well I I I go to Lula and I'm
[13:01] well trained and and and and I can't
[13:03] fall for anything yes you can right yes
[13:06] you can because they are there are
[13:08] deceivers out here that that are trying
[13:10] to deceive you spiritually and they'll
[13:13] do and say whatever they they they they
[13:15] can because it sounds right it sounds
[13:18] good but you have to be Discerning of
[13:20] what what's being said and compareed to
[13:23] the word compareed to the message right
[13:25] right because the that the word is our
[13:27] absolute so fishing fishing is is one of
[13:30] the things that are out there and it's
[13:32] what scammers when they send fake
[13:34] messages that appear to be from trusted
[13:36] sources to trick you into revealing
[13:39] personal information like your social
[13:40] security or credit credit card number
[13:43] and uh it's very very uh a very uh um it
[13:48] works for them that's why they keep
[13:50] doing it you know when you receive those
[13:53] messages on Whatsapp from somebody
[13:56] overseas and stuff like that and you
[13:59] have not even met the person I I get
[14:01] them all the time I get them and I Hey
[14:04] Brother come we need your ministry over
[14:06] here
[14:07] what I don't know you you're talking to
[14:10] me like we've already met and and and
[14:13] and
[14:14] and I don't know you some of the most
[14:18] sometimes those things lead to hey well
[14:21] U you might not be able to come but uh
[14:23] can you go ahead and send us an offering
[14:25] for uh such and
[14:26] such most of the time I just ignore
[14:29] those those messages and I'm sorry if
[14:31] they're True Believers or not but
[14:33] honestly I can't you cannot waste your
[14:36] time and and you really you really just
[14:38] have to be Discerning because I'm sure
[14:40] that they have some sort of help over
[14:42] there they got a
[14:43] pastor if they go to your pastor talk to
[14:46] your pastor you know you don't know me
[14:48] and I don't know you so so so I'll pray
[14:51] for you I tell I'll pray for you and
[14:53] that's it but but you just have to be
[14:56] Discerning and you can't fall for
[14:57] anything and everything that everybody
[14:59] says just under the name of the message
[15:01] or just because they have a cloud
[15:03] picture on their profile picture or or
[15:05] something like that you can't do
[15:07] that and that might sound bad that might
[15:09] sound well you don't have feelings
[15:12] but I'm sorry I I got assets that I need
[15:16] to protect I have a family that I need
[15:17] to protect I got to protect the church I
[15:19] got to protect my testimony I got to I
[15:22] got to protect all those things you see
[15:24] and I don't know you from from the
[15:26] person you know out here any other
[15:28] person out here in Street even though
[15:30] you say you believe the message you know
[15:32] let me meet you first right right and
[15:36] then maybe we can talk
[15:38] but all right so the best scams seem the
[15:41] most harmless
[15:43] right Genesis 3 1-6 we read when we were
[15:47] talking about this this uh past
[15:49] Wednesday about the voices right the
[15:52] serpent he took his time to get into
[15:54] Eve's head you know I remember brother
[15:56] Dell you know he he he said it could
[15:58] have been it could have been years where
[16:00] he got he worked with Eve right and it
[16:04] would have been maybe five minute chats
[16:05] here and there you know just get Eve to
[16:08] the side a little bit away from Adam you
[16:10] know and just get into her head and
[16:13] eventually amen he leared her to think
[16:16] that she needed what he was
[16:18] offering all right and that is what a
[16:21] good scam is it makes you think that you
[16:25] need what is being offered that you need
[16:28] it and then if you don't get it right
[16:30] now and if you don't if you there's no
[16:32] time to wait you have you have to get it
[16:35] right now that there's not they put that
[16:38] time element in there you're going to
[16:41] miss it you're going to miss it a good I
[16:43] mean if you don't get it right now at
[16:45] this price I mean tomorrow it's going to
[16:47] go go up I'm telling you you're going to
[16:50] and you and you realize next day it's
[16:53] the same price you
[16:55] right but the coupon says I mean it the
[16:57] popup window came came up to you when
[16:59] you went to walmart.com get it now you
[17:02] know well and it's all just the tactics
[17:06] it's psychological really selling and
[17:09] and and and scamming somebody is really
[17:12] psychological more than anything else
[17:14] they know how to get into people's head
[17:17] and so the same thing is with a a good a
[17:19] a preacher maybe he doesn't necessarily
[17:23] want to deceive but in order to get
[17:25] people to view to look at his Viewpoint
[17:28] he has to use psychological things in
[17:30] order to do it right he'll use the word
[17:33] because Satan always comes with the
[17:35] word right 99% word but then he'll use
[17:40] that little 1% psychology in there that
[17:42] really gets you my praise God hallelujah
[17:46] you know you start you know and then you
[17:48] see all the doctrines that have come up
[17:50] you know since the 80s 90s everybody's
[17:53] jumping and shouting and screaming and
[17:55] stuff for that man you know and that man
[17:58] you know he's you know he's very yeah
[18:01] you know and and people fall into that
[18:03] trance under the name of the message
[18:06] under the name of the message that's
[18:09] right so so the best scam seem the most
[18:13] harmless you know uh I remember one time
[18:16] my wife can remember this we were in
[18:17] Atlanta and uh we were just walking my
[18:20] wife and me and uh a man comes up to us
[18:24] and says hey could I have some food uh
[18:26] could I have some money could I have
[18:27] some money for food
[18:30] and I said well I don't have any money
[18:32] with me and I don't remember if I did
[18:33] have cash with me or not but I said but
[18:36] I'll be I'll be more than glad to buy
[18:37] you some some food said okay I'll do
[18:40] that for anybody that asks now we'll
[18:42] look at here something for if you want
[18:44] food I'll buy you a food if you need gas
[18:47] I'll buy you a little bit of gas
[18:49] normally I don't have cash with me so I
[18:51] I don't give people normally cash I have
[18:54] in the past but but but I limit my my my
[18:57] my amount however
[18:59] I went in the subway down there in
[19:01] downtown Atlanta went in there I said go
[19:04] get get you what you know get you
[19:06] something and I was just thinking he was
[19:08] just going to get a 6 inch sub you know
[19:09] something you know tuna you know
[19:11] something like that he he starts
[19:13] ordering a foot long put this on there
[19:16] put I mean he was he was ordering
[19:18] everything from from the from the from
[19:19] the line from uh he was ear the chips
[19:23] and and everything and and I just I just
[19:27] all I kept thinking was you know Lord
[19:29] you said in your word he that asks give
[19:32] give freely it's what you said in your
[19:34] word so maybe he needs this and he
[19:37] probably went and sold half of it to
[19:39] somebody else one of his one of his
[19:41] friends but that's up to him I gave him
[19:44] food right that that's between him and
[19:47] God what he did with the food then right
[19:50] you're only commanded Amen to to do what
[19:52] Jesus said in the word you know I have a
[19:55] friend one time in Greenville he he he
[19:57] went to a Burger King parking lot and he
[20:00] he the guy was asking for food and he
[20:02] said I'll come in here and buy you a
[20:03] burger he said no I don't want that one
[20:05] that's too
[20:08] greasy Beggars can't be
[20:11] choosers that means he really really
[20:13] want the food he wanted to see if he
[20:15] could get something else so you
[20:20] um but but you know that that's that's
[20:23] that's that's how it is
[20:25] um there was a verse here that that I
[20:27] wanted to look at I think it's later on
[20:29] but now the best scams seem the most
[20:31] harmless in Matthew 24:24 says for there
[20:34] shall arise false christs and false
[20:36] prophets and shall show you great signs
[20:38] and wonders in so much that if it were
[20:41] possible they shall deceive the very
[20:43] elect my these was Jesus's own words
[20:47] right that if it was possible this thing
[20:49] would would be so close that it would
[20:52] deceive the very elect if it was
[20:54] possible that's why we have to be very
[20:57] very Discerning amen what's going on in
[20:59] our day amen around the world Amen you
[21:04] have to be don't take things for face
[21:06] Valley there are men out there really
[21:08] trying to deceive politically
[21:11] spiritually amen they might just look
[21:14] like exactly exactly what you want to
[21:17] hear but you don't know what's behind
[21:19] that person's
[21:21] intentions right he might have said he
[21:24] he might have said hey I'm going to
[21:25] change this I'm going to change it and
[21:27] he said it in 2016 nothing happened what
[21:29] would make you think that he would
[21:31] change things
[21:33] now just saying exactly right just
[21:36] saying all right there's a woman that
[21:39] has a candidate right now who's saying
[21:41] hey I'll change this for you but she's
[21:43] had four years to change it why won't
[21:45] they change it now right just looking at
[21:48] it politically okay be Discerning right
[21:51] because these people have alliances with
[21:54] with with with other countries with
[21:56] other other uh uh entities
[21:59] and they are looking to fill their
[22:01] pockets that's one thing but they also
[22:04] have agendas to push right so be
[22:07] Discerning they're saying that this this
[22:10] this this uh election season I'm not
[22:12] trying to be political but what I'm
[22:13] saying is this election SE it could be
[22:15] the last one that we'll ever
[22:17] see even Trump said
[22:19] that I don't know why he said
[22:22] it but who knows what they got what they
[22:25] got in store and Christians are falling
[22:27] for it head over heill
[22:29] like he's the
[22:31] Messiah like like like you just they
[22:33] talk about the golden age that he's a m
[22:37] the you know and and so you just be
[22:40] careful be careful be Discerning be very
[22:43] very I'm not trying to tell you who to
[22:45] vote for or not to vote for but this is
[22:47] coming up on Tuesday right but you be
[22:50] Discerning right if if you if you think
[22:53] voting makes a difference that's fine be
[22:56] Discerning right be discerning just that
[22:59] that's all I'm going to say just be
[23:01] Discerning um because uh look into the
[23:05] man that's all I'm going to say look
[23:07] into his
[23:09] background so uh just as fishing
[23:11] attempts look genuine to lure victims
[23:14] spiritual deceptions often seem
[23:17] attractive and
[23:18] plausible spiritual
[23:21] deceptions they seem yeah they make
[23:23] sense yeah what they're saying in in the
[23:27] middle of the rah you don't
[23:29] think because everybody is wow everybody
[23:32] is RA that means it must be right but
[23:36] that's that's not how it goes that's not
[23:38] how it is right you know you have to
[23:41] know the word for yourself you have to
[23:43] know the the situation for yourself the
[23:45] cost of fallen for deception second
[23:47] Corin I'm going Tove little quickly 2
[23:49] Corinthians 11:3 says but I fear lest by
[23:51] any means as the serpent begal Eve
[23:53] through his subtility so your minds
[23:56] should be corrupted from the Simplicity
[23:58] that is in in Christ why why did why
[24:00] does uh Paul say your minds because when
[24:04] Eve when the serpent came to Eve he
[24:06] didn't force her to do what what he did
[24:09] he got into her mind first right right
[24:12] that's that's a good deceiver is going
[24:14] to get into your mind first he's not
[24:16] going to force you he's going to talk to
[24:18] you he's going to he's going to make
[24:20] sure he works with you he's going to
[24:23] massage that that he's trying to you
[24:25] know as much as he can so that you feel
[24:29] so relaxed this can't possibly be bad
[24:34] oh and then he'll get you right after
[24:38] see just like physical or internet scams
[24:40] like the serpent half truths to Eve they
[24:43] lure with false promises and can lead to
[24:45] Serious consequences and then you're
[24:48] wondering what in the world just
[24:50] happened they massaged
[24:52] you you got massaged by the devil
[24:58] all right now this is what I was talking
[25:01] about Jesus said give that's up to you
[25:04] if you want to obey what Jesus said
[25:06] Jesus said in Matthew 5:42 give to him
[25:09] that asketh thee
[25:12] period right and from him that would
[25:15] borrow of thee turn not thou away but
[25:17] there's a c caveat here because you
[25:21] don't see the person behind online you
[25:24] don't know the person that's trying to
[25:26] reach you you don't you don't know that
[25:27] person right so you you're you're not
[25:31] bound you don't need to give anybody any
[25:33] money that ass online you have never met
[25:35] this person you have never seen this
[25:37] person but a person that comes to you
[25:39] physically you see it and asks hey um
[25:43] can I have a dollar you know I'm they
[25:46] might be lying and you and they probably
[25:48] are but Jesus said give to him that ask
[25:51] thee now sometimes what I do is I I
[25:54] start talking to them like hey so what
[25:57] made you you know uh I was talking to a
[26:00] girl one time in in in a parking lot in
[26:02] Atlanta she was asking for money and uh
[26:05] just talking with her talking about
[26:06] things of the Lord that's an opportunity
[26:08] for you to witness right hey you want my
[26:11] money you want then then you you'll hear
[26:14] about the Lord for a little
[26:15] bit
[26:17] yeah that you sometimes we say we just
[26:20] use we say those you know leave them
[26:24] alone they're just scammers they're just
[26:26] but the the opportunity maybe the the
[26:28] Lord is doing that opportunity so that
[26:30] that person might need the gospel you
[26:32] know that's right then hey you listen to
[26:35] me for a little while I'll give you you
[26:37] know a couple of bucks whatever but what
[26:38] you do with it that's up that's between
[26:40] you and God that's right right exactly
[26:43] so so uh but some people like no
[26:46] absolutely not I will not give anybody I
[26:48] know what they are they're going to go
[26:49] smoke weed with it they're going to go
[26:51] that you just follow what Jesus said and
[26:54] let the Lord do the rest that that Jesus
[26:57] said give to him that asketh thee it
[27:00] doesn't not say
[27:02] that it says that all right so if if a
[27:07] random person ask me personally for help
[27:08] I give with reason within reason they
[27:11] they're going to ask me for $10,000 you
[27:13] know I'm not going to give them
[27:14] $110,000 right right but but but but the
[27:18] person you know online that's asking for
[27:20] that amount then you give them that
[27:22] amount that that's that's that's totally
[27:25] different you see that's that's that's
[27:28] foolish we wouldn't do that physically
[27:30] why would we do it online you see so
[27:32] this verse uh doesn't apply to anyone
[27:34] online that you don't know asking for
[27:36] money
[27:37] right you know
[27:39] so sometimes people ask hey can I have a
[27:42] little bit of guest now there's the ones
[27:44] out there they're they're out there with
[27:45] the with the cardboard you know and and
[27:48] say I'm I'm hard times you know I
[27:51] normally don't give people them because
[27:54] they're not asking me personally they're
[27:56] just out there for anybody
[27:58] to to and I I have my reasons you know I
[28:04] that hey look look there's Mexicans that
[28:07] come to this country and they they find
[28:10] jobs for you to be out there you're an
[28:12] American citizen you have sources
[28:15] resources these people for come from
[28:17] other countries they got work they can
[28:18] come and work they find jobs easily why
[28:21] can't you you see so that's just what
[28:24] I'm going to say about
[28:26] that I'm very strong that's my wife I
[28:29] just
[28:30] can't I the ones with the cardboards
[28:33] those are scammers I mean my wife but
[28:35] she'd tell you there was a one in a lady
[28:37] in Toronto that would do the same thing
[28:39] Toronto Canada and come to find out I
[28:41] mean they'll follow these people back
[28:43] for their sources they're driving
[28:45] Mercedes they got nice uh penth houses
[28:48] and that was the same with this lady in
[28:50] Toronto lady out there in the streets
[28:52] you know but they take turns they have
[28:55] shifts they do this all together it's
[28:58] it's a scam don't fall for it so
[29:01] building a strong defense is really
[29:03] really one of the things that we need we
[29:05] should start doing the putting on the
[29:07] full armor of God right I know we're
[29:10] we're dealing a lot with the physical
[29:11] things but but it if if you see it in
[29:14] the physical it ties in with the
[29:16] spiritual the natural ties in with the
[29:17] spiritual you see put on the whole armor
[29:20] of God that you may be able to stand
[29:21] against the walls of the devil you know
[29:23] and then I got here just as we install
[29:25] antivirus software uh or things to
[29:28] protect our computers we need the armor
[29:30] of God as spiritual defense right with
[29:33] each piece uh strengthening our
[29:35] discernment res and resilience against
[29:38] worldly influences so if if we want to
[29:40] protect our computers or our phones or
[29:43] things like that from those things how
[29:45] much more our souls right how much more
[29:47] our souls from we need to put on the
[29:50] whole armor of God right and so the
[29:53] power of knowledge and wisdom amen Hosea
[29:55] 4:6 says my people are destroyed for for
[29:58] lack of
[30:01] knowledge they don't get in the word
[30:03] right because thou has rejected
[30:05] knowledge I will also reject thee this
[30:07] is this is the Lord saying this so scams
[30:12] often exploit a lack of knowledge
[30:15] because you don't know and you don't
[30:17] understand you fall for it much easy so
[30:20] it's it it's good it behooves us for us
[30:23] to study right just like I'm in I'm on
[30:26] I'm online all the time I have to study
[30:29] and see what the latest scams are and
[30:31] what's going on out there right because
[30:33] I have I have assets to protect right I
[30:36] have things that I need to protect and
[30:38] so so the need for Godly wisdom and
[30:40] knowledge of scripture to prevent
[30:42] spiritual deception is a must just as
[30:45] Internet safety education helps us to
[30:47] avoid fraud amen Proverbs 4:23 says keep
[30:50] thy heart with all diligence for out of
[30:52] it are the issues of Life internet scams
[30:55] pray on our fears desires and good
[30:57] willll reminding us to God our hearts by
[31:00] letting faith and wisdom rather than
[31:03] fear or urgency guide our actions amen
[31:07] and that's that's where the scammers
[31:09] like to they like to make it urgent amen
[31:12] and we fall pray for that so we also and
[31:15] I believe this is the okay being wise
[31:17] stewards of our resources Proverbs 3:9
[31:19] says honor the Lord with thy substance
[31:22] and with the first fruits of all thine
[31:24] increase amen we we're called Amen to
[31:27] protect amen what God has given us right
[31:31] for us to just easily fall prey for
[31:33] anything that that that the devil brings
[31:35] in our lives right the the the devil is
[31:38] out there to try to steal kill and
[31:41] destroy right and he'll use whatever
[31:44] person whatever individual to do it
[31:46] right but we're called to be wise
[31:49] stewards of our of our money our time
[31:51] and our relationships amen and
[31:54] recognizing that our resources are gifts
[31:56] from God to be used while wisely so it's
[31:59] okay for you to say no to that WhatsApp
[32:02] message don't think you can I'm sorry
[32:05] just delete it I don't know you I I'm
[32:08] I'm sorry you might be a brother in
[32:10] Christ just delete it right delete it
[32:15] unless you sure you definitely know that
[32:18] person beyond the shadow of the doubt
[32:20] you know their their Pastor you know and
[32:22] then you maybe you can consider it but
[32:25] but then at that point consider with
[32:27] reason
[32:29] brother brand says this and with this
[32:31] deis come up many are like Eve Eve just
[32:34] stopped long enough to be deceived she
[32:36] stopped long enough to be deceived if
[32:38] she hadn't have stopped there had there
[32:41] there have never been no deceiving but
[32:44] Eve stopped and when she stopped there
[32:47] were there's where she got her deceiving
[32:49] instead of pressing
[32:51] on you stopped you stopped and listened
[32:54] to the devil's
[32:55] lie uh and and listen to what he had to
[32:58] say see to the devil you can't Li you
[33:01] can't listen to him right right you
[33:04] can't listen to him because he's lying
[33:07] he's telling he's he's he he's saying
[33:09] truth but at the same time mixing it
[33:11] with lies and you can't stop and listen
[33:13] to him at all so that's what Eve should
[33:16] have done she should have recognized she
[33:18] should recognized that this can't be
[33:21] from God because it's going against what
[33:23] God had already originally told us
[33:25] therefore it would have that knowledge
[33:27] would have been able to stop the
[33:29] incident but she didn't follow through
[33:32] and
[33:33] therefore what happened happened so God
[33:36] bless you all let's be Discerning
[33:37] especially in this coming year if we're
[33:40] still here let's be Discerning because
[33:43] uh um we have to be in this hour God
[33:45] bless y'all
[33:47] [Applause]
