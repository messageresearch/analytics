[0:01] but nobody knows that on this all
[0:04] right so King Jesus is all in all in the
[0:08] future home we read where that we didn't
[0:10] need a temple we didn't need a light we
[0:12] didn't need these things we don't need a
[0:15] place to live because Jesus King Jesus
[0:19] says all things are finished all things
[0:21] are made new that's not in the
[0:22] Millennium cuz all things are not made
[0:24] new in the Millennium all right now it's
[0:27] a new Heaven and a new Earth
[0:31] because the first Heaven the first
[0:32] Earth's going to pass away in other
[0:33] words there's going to be an atomic
[0:35] explosion and man's fire will burn up
[0:37] the
[0:38] Earth and I call it man's fire the you
[0:41] know the Bible says that man and even
[0:44] the prophet and even in scientific if
[0:49] they'll if they'll agree with it science
[0:52] knows that man's always destroyed
[0:54] himself everything man's done we build a
[0:57] car but yet a car kills more people than
[0:59] any w war that we've ever had for a
[1:02] year uh gunpowder to protect yourself
[1:06] yeah but they use it in wars and rifles
[1:09] and um bombs and okay nuclear power I
[1:14] wish we had more nuclear power but more
[1:17] nuclear power means that we make more
[1:18] nuclear
[1:19] bombs so man can't just stay in that one
[1:23] line of producing something that's good
[1:26] and and it continues on because the
[1:30] Bible says we have no continuing City
[1:32] all right but this city even in the
[1:36] Millennium it's not a continuing
[1:39] City there's only one continuing City
[1:42] that's that future home right there all
[1:44] right whatever is built in the
[1:46] Millennium is going to be burnt off
[1:49] before the future home gets here all
[1:52] right right everybody understand
[1:54] that so Jesus is King Jesus in the
[1:57] future home he's King Jesus to us should
[2:00] be down here but what I'm talking about
[2:02] is dispensations of
[2:04] time because you still have time
[2:09] here this is all eternity everything
[2:13] right is eternity everything I mean from
[2:16] as far down as man went every person on
[2:19] the earth is
[2:21] eternal um in the Millennium there's
[2:24] questions of maybe
[2:27] um somebody's got to live a thousand
[2:29] years it's got to be some human person
[2:31] you and I are not going to fulfill that
[2:33] scripture because we're Eternal before
[2:35] we get to the
[2:37] Millennium I'll read to you in a minute
[2:39] what it is but we showed that in the
[2:41] Millennium we read the scripture last
[2:44] week in in Isaiah 11 I believe it was
[2:47] that uh 11 6-9 or and 97 that he' be the
[2:52] son of David it was promised that
[2:55] David's son would sit on the throne
[2:57] ruling and reigning the children of
[2:59] Israel Israel the 12 tribes the only
[3:01] time the 12 tribes are going to be back
[3:03] in order is when we get into the
[3:05] Millennium when those 12,000 * 12 go
[3:09] into the Millennium they're going to be
[3:11] back in order ready to go all right and
[3:14] then Jesus will sit on the throne as a
[3:16] son of
[3:17] David he's going to be our King Jesus
[3:20] but there's some people that are still
[3:23] dead down
[3:25] here that don't know about this King
[3:27] Jesus right so it's not all in
[3:30] all he's not all in all with this
[3:33] foolish virgin down here in the whatever
[3:35] Dimension they're in fifth or or or or
[3:38] somewhere that they're waiting to be
[3:40] given eternal life and then they can
[3:42] call him King Jesus the reason they the
[3:45] reason they're down there is because
[3:47] they didn't know who King Jesus
[3:49] was that's why we get all in all here if
[3:52] we don't get all in all here then we
[3:54] have to die and go by the grave cuz we
[3:55] can't we can't claim
[3:58] this right we we can't claim son of
[4:00] David right it's either Son of God or
[4:02] son of man we can't claim him a son of
[4:05] David all right cuz remember the cyhan
[4:07] woman she said thou son of David have
[4:09] mercy on me he didn't even pay her any
[4:11] attention but when she said my Lord
[4:15] right brother R said he had to address
[4:18] her then because she approached him
[4:20] right all right and to pray today I
[4:24] don't think you can get down on your
[4:25] knees and say son of David Son of David
[4:28] have mercy on me because he's not your
[4:30] son of David right okay that's to the
[4:33] Jews right
[4:36] okay but see that's why we had to get a
[4:39] revelation of this right here
[4:41] right now right now all in all
[4:45] incompasses Son of God Son of Man son of
[4:48] David but in dispensation of the way the
[4:51] Bible's written we got to go by what the
[4:53] Bible says the way the dispensations are
[4:55] written with the Gentiles I mean with
[4:57] the Jews that we talked about in Daniel
[4:59] 7 weeks with the Jews they turned him
[5:01] down he married the Gentiles took a
[5:03] gentile bride but he promised he'd never
[5:05] forget Israel well here's where he's not
[5:06] going to forget Israel he's going to
[5:08] rule and reign in the Millennium temple
[5:10] in Ezekiel
[5:11] 40-44 they build a temple and he sets in
[5:15] that
[5:15] Temple now we don't need that let me
[5:19] read something to you I ask you to read
[5:21] the future home let's listen to
[5:27] this future home page
[5:30] 30 the Millennium is not the end of it
[5:33] there shall there still be there shall
[5:35] still be time after the Millennium the
[5:37] Millennium is a space of time but not
[5:40] the new Earth no indeed notice and that
[5:43] we'll get to it in a
[5:44] bit notice this is still not referring
[5:47] to this Millennium Reign the thousand
[5:49] years is not the new Earth the
[5:51] Millennium Reign is a different Reign
[5:53] that's what we get into the Millennium
[5:55] but that isn't the new Earth and the new
[5:57] heaven no no that's just a rest period
[5:59] period rest Place see a rest period not
[6:03] at all the new heavens and new earth for
[6:05] see in the Millennium we have things
[6:07] that would not go into that the new
[6:11] heaven new Earth okay that's what he's
[6:14] talking about it's a type of the old
[6:17] seventh day out of Eden the seventh day
[6:20] after he made the world the seventh day
[6:21] he rested in Eden so everybody
[6:24] understand that he he he created man six
[6:27] day six day he created man then he
[6:29] rested the seventh day the 7,000 year he
[6:32] created man all right so we've got what
[6:35] how many years we got up to the flood
[6:37] there was 2,000
[6:39] years right to Jesus Christ it was 2,000
[6:42] years and now we've had 2,000 years
[6:44] right so that's 6,000 we're waiting on
[6:48] this cuz this is the seventh
[6:51] day seventh day rest cuz Jesus I mean U
[6:55] Jesus said come unto me all you labor
[6:57] and heavy heavy laden I'll give you rest
[7:00] that's the so
[7:01] person but there is a seventh day rest
[7:04] for this
[7:05] Earth that hasn't come
[7:07] yet we're waiting on that last thousand
[7:10] years to fulfill everything all
[7:14] right after he made the world the
[7:16] seventh day he rested in Eden now let's
[7:18] go to paragraph 62 or page 62 while it's
[7:22] going through the Millennium it's going
[7:23] through its sanctifying process but
[7:25] still must be burned which the blood
[7:28] redeemed the people it show is memorial
[7:30] the bride shall take that thousand years
[7:32] but then it has to be cleansed by fire
[7:34] just like you were his delegates of the
[7:36] city the delegation so if you die if you
[7:38] live what difference does it make if he
[7:40] comes tomorrow comes 100 years or a
[7:41] thousand years I only rest until my
[7:43] change
[7:45] comes questions and answers
[7:47] 1964 will there be sin on Earth during
[7:50] the
[7:51] time no there will not be sin on the
[7:54] earth Satan is bound somebody ask him a
[7:56] question would it be sin on the earth at
[7:58] the time of the Millennium no won't be S
[8:00] on the
[8:01] earth and will there be people on Earth
[8:05] in Corporal bodies during that time yes
[8:06] sir we will have our glorified body
[8:09] right here on Earth eating drinking
[8:10] building
[8:12] houses and living just like we do now
[8:14] for a thousand
[8:17] years it's the honeymoon of the bride
[8:20] and the groom now continuation of
[8:23] questions and answers
[8:24] 1964 um a week later this is
[8:28] 83064 time never ceased until this must
[8:31] be a post-millennial or something that
[8:33] asked this question because see we got a
[8:36] thousand years after the church has gone
[8:38] home and comes back upon the Earth then
[8:39] time ceases in the new Heaven and new
[8:42] earth now the Millennium is not the new
[8:44] Heavens in New Earth there will still be
[8:46] sin after the Millennium the Millennium
[8:49] is a type of Noah going in the ark and
[8:51] carried over and brought ham and them on
[8:52] the other side and sin even come out of
[8:55] the Ark see but Enoch the translated one
[8:58] was the type of the Bride that went up
[8:59] not the one that was carried over so sin
[9:02] will still be on the other side of the
[9:03] Millennium but not during the Millennium
[9:06] during the Millennium is peace but sin
[9:08] will be dealt with on the other side of
[9:09] Millennium and then time Fades out you
[9:13] see what he's saying there won't be sin
[9:15] on the on the Earth but sin will still
[9:18] be here he said sin will have to be
[9:20] dealt with right
[9:23] here all right it's to be white Throne
[9:28] judgment
[9:30] those sins got to be dealt with when
[9:32] right
[9:34] here so he's not saying that there's
[9:37] going to be Sinners on the
[9:39] Earth but there there's going to be as
[9:41] long as the devil's here there's going
[9:43] to be sin cuz he's an unbeliever all
[9:47] right but when he is thrown in the Lake
[9:49] of Fire and we the the city comes down
[9:53] which we'll get to in a little
[9:55] while then sin is dealt with cuz sin is
[9:58] De dealt with at the white Throne
[10:01] everything comes together right there at
[10:02] the white Throne judgment all
[10:05] right but this is still in a seventh day
[10:08] rest this is still in
[10:10] time but yet he reigns as the son of
[10:14] David this
[10:25] is our honeymoon right the brid's
[10:31] honeymoon but now that's not our
[10:33] honeymoon here this is our
[10:37] home in June got married in a church we
[10:39] went on a honeymoon to Pigeon Forge um
[10:43] Tennessee but Pigeon Forge Tennessee
[10:45] wasn't our home we come back we come
[10:48] across the threshold and we walked into
[10:50] our new
[10:51] home right so that's what God's going to
[10:54] do with the bride he's giving us a
[10:57] honeymoon here
[11:00] we stand at this white Throne judgment
[11:03] and this is going to
[11:06] be make it
[11:11] better our
[11:14] Eternal all
[11:17] right so we got son of David to the
[11:20] Jews then he's King Jesus all in all
[11:24] Brides honeymoon in the Millennium but
[11:26] this is our Eternal home this is not our
[11:28] Eternal home home in the
[11:30] Millennium somebody's going to live that
[11:32] thousand years to prove that the sin
[11:35] curse is over for what the
[11:39] people when the devil loo for a short
[11:43] time where is that in the chart is that
[11:46] before the white it's right in there
[11:49] because what
[11:51] happens uh we'll read it um not this
[11:54] Sunday probably but the Bible says that
[11:57] the Battle of go and May
[11:59] that Satan brings his
[12:03] forces up out of maybe the fourth or
[12:06] fifth dimension and he tries to take
[12:09] over the Lord takes us out on the breath
[12:12] of the earth and then the Holy Fire of
[12:15] God Falls well see you can say well
[12:16] where does that happen really doesn't
[12:18] matter to us but somewhere in here is
[12:22] where it's going to happen it's going to
[12:24] happen after the Millennium and before
[12:25] the future home so whatever order you
[12:28] want to put it in there's one thing for
[12:29] sure once it's burned off in that battle
[12:32] of Gog and Magog you got to remember
[12:34] that starts into eternity so it really
[12:36] doesn't matter you say well it doesn't
[12:38] say verb Adam in the Bible it says we'll
[12:42] be taken down on the breath of the earth
[12:43] God's going to reain his fire Holy Fire
[12:46] which will kill Souls then remember the
[12:48] Bible says fear the one that can kill
[12:50] the soul not the body Jesus Jesus Jesus
[12:53] well I don't say Jesus y'all know who
[12:54] Jesus is God's the only one that can
[12:56] kill the soul right right he who made it
[12:59] can kill it right okay so God will will
[13:03] judge the people and actually their
[13:05] Soul's not going to be killed at the
[13:06] whiteone Judgment they're going to have
[13:07] to go through a
[13:09] torment for a time and then their soul
[13:12] is just going to one day it's just going
[13:14] to go out of existence right what a
[13:16] horrible thing there's nothing on this
[13:19] Earth worth
[13:20] that we're going to get into that maybe
[13:22] this afternoon there's nothing on this
[13:24] world worth losing your soul for just to
[13:28] go out and just be nothing anymore just
[13:30] be like you never were here right you
[13:32] just go completely out of existence or
[13:34] you can accept him and live for
[13:36] eternities upon eternities upon
[13:38] eternities and and enjoy the joy of the
[13:40] Lord so a lot of people can't take
[13:44] that but that's our promise so it's a
[13:48] bright honeymoon nothing of
[13:51] judgment all right now the Bible says
[13:54] that he'll sit on his throne and judge
[13:56] the 12 tribes of Israel
[13:59] there's a lot of things see there in the
[14:00] Millennium that you can do with the
[14:05] Jews but not with us because remember
[14:08] we're Eternal all we're here for is a
[14:10] honeymoon right remember when you went
[14:12] on your honeymoon if some of you got to
[14:14] go to a nice Motel I mean they took care
[14:17] of everything everything was done if you
[14:20] were able to have you know somebody come
[14:23] in and and make your beds and you know
[14:25] fix your meals and and you know you
[14:27] didn't you didn't go on the honeymoon
[14:29] and do all the cooking you're not
[14:31] supposed to have went and done all the
[14:33] cooking let's put it that way let's
[14:36] let's just say in a fantasy world in a
[14:38] fantasy world in a fantasy
[14:41] world you would have went to a um resort
[14:46] resort or um a Hilton and just said
[14:49] bring me room service for 3 days I ain't
[14:52] even going to look out the
[14:54] window okay well that's what it's going
[14:55] to be in this honeymoon we're going to
[14:57] be there
[14:59] things are going to be going on around
[15:00] us that we really don't have to
[15:02] understand I don't think because there's
[15:04] a lot of things because remember we're
[15:05] still in they're still in time you and I
[15:07] are not we're going to be in BL right we
[15:10] don't have to worry about living a
[15:12] thousand years but what we're going to
[15:13] be there though we've got to be there to
[15:16] prove all what the Bible's talking about
[15:18] right but it's not going to be like
[15:20] living
[15:23] here you missed the
[15:27] quote yes sir we will have glorified
[15:30] bodies right here on Earth eating
[15:31] drinking building houses and living just
[15:34] like we do now for a thous years the
[15:37] atmosphere around is going to be
[15:39] horrible is it B right no but we're
[15:42] still going to live here we can be the
[15:45] example right like we do for thousand
[15:47] for the Jews
[15:48] sure so you got to
[15:52] remember the Jews missed him
[15:56] right and for this whole Millennium time
[15:59] I believe that's why the temple see the
[16:01] Temple's going to be built Ezekiel
[16:04] 40-44 and I'm glad that a prophet
[16:07] brought the message to show us that that
[16:09] was a real literal Temple that's not
[16:12] just you know you say well look this ISS
[16:14] a new Heaven and a new Earth you know
[16:16] and but watch what God does in Ezekiel
[16:19] 42:44 he tells the exact dimensions
[16:22] right of the courtyard of the we know
[16:26] it's going to be outer Court inner Court
[16:27] holy of holies right but there'll be no
[16:29] sacrifices made nothing to be killed but
[16:32] what a glorious time you can take
[16:34] somebody in a Jew in and say hey y'all
[16:36] built all this in this first court let
[16:38] me explain to you how it affected my
[16:40] life right my literal life not the pots
[16:44] and the pans and the hanging of this and
[16:46] the C golden candlesticks and and the
[16:49] the the Ark of the Covenant cuz when we
[16:51] walk in the holy of holies brother
[16:53] brandom right here in
[16:56] uh um six-fold
[17:00] purpose in the six-fold purpose Daniel
[17:03] 78 1961 what is the most holy to my way
[17:06] of sining which I believe I can prove it
[17:08] by the scripture is to anoint the most
[17:09] holy which will be the temp the
[17:11] Tabernacle that will be used during the
[17:13] Millennium described in Ezekiel
[17:18] 40-44 let's find out a picture in the
[17:20] Millennium how they will anoint the
[17:23] temple well we know
[17:24] what we know who that is right now watch
[17:28] 119 description of the temple that is to
[17:30] be built he's actually getting ready to
[17:32] read but you doesn't read all of it 40
[17:34] through
[17:35] 44 description of the temple is to be
[17:38] built in the Millennium now everyone
[17:39] anyone any reader knows Ezekiel 40 the
[17:42] 40th chapter until about the 44th
[17:44] chapter there's nothing in the world but
[17:45] the Millennium temple being erected on
[17:48] Earth when the glory of the Lord fills
[17:50] it and so forth like
[17:52] that and it's described in the 43rd
[17:55] chapter
[17:56] 1-6 and what it is to me it's a
[18:00] prefigure of
[18:04] this it's a prefigure of the future home
[18:08] but now remember this we're not going to
[18:10] build this is going to be built the
[18:13] Millennium Temple I don't have it
[18:14] written up here but the Millennium
[18:15] Temple is going to be built
[18:19] it's too much saying about how we're
[18:21] going to build and build and build for
[18:23] it not to be but if read Ezekiel 40344
[18:27] and then read in Revelation 22 or 20
[18:30] 22 it gives you the dimensions remember
[18:33] 1500 M square and it's going to be
[18:35] Jasper and gold and all that stuff you
[18:37] see part of that in the
[18:40] Millennium the future home the only
[18:42] thing is not going to be is it's not
[18:44] going to be a outer Court inner Court
[18:46] holy of holies
[18:48] Temple because when we get right here
[18:50] King Jesus is going to set on one
[18:54] Throne right we're not going to need
[18:56] justification sanctification baptism the
[18:58] holy go they're already going to be
[19:00] Eternal all
[19:02] right but we can walk through this
[19:04] Millennium and teach I believe sit down
[19:07] under a tree and just teach these Jews
[19:10] or or whoever if they got Heathen raised
[19:12] up in the Millennium brother randam said
[19:13] one time that that a a heathen will be
[19:16] raised up in the Millennium and a gospel
[19:17] will be preached to them don't ask me
[19:20] about that I know one thing's for sure
[19:21] that's not going to happen here right
[19:24] that's why he said he said I can see a
[19:25] lot of things happening in the
[19:26] Millennium that I can't see happening in
[19:28] future home they asked him one time they
[19:30] said will babies be born in the
[19:31] Millennium he said looks like you can
[19:34] looks like you can because that one
[19:36] scripture I just read for a
[19:38] baby a baby there'll be no babies right
[19:41] here it won't be a baby in this future
[19:44] home everybody will be 18 to 20 years
[19:46] old full grown
[19:49] Millennium I don't
[19:52] know one thing for sure the bride will
[19:57] be a 18 to 20 years old the 144,000 will
[20:01] be 18 to 20 years old cuz they get a
[20:03] change just like we did and go in a
[20:05] Rapture they come back and build that
[20:07] Millennium Temple and then we walk into
[20:09] it that's what he was proven in Daniel
[20:10] 70 week the last half of that week after
[20:15] the Rapture the last half of that first
[20:17] half of that week they get the gospel
[20:19] preached to them the last half of the
[20:20] week is when they come back I believe
[20:22] and build a millennium Temple cuz you
[20:24] got to battle of Armageddon then they
[20:26] come right back here cuz he's going to
[20:28] set
[20:30] there when you walk in the holy of
[20:32] holies in this temple in the Millennium
[20:34] that's where your son of David's going
[20:35] to be setting which will be Jesus Christ
[20:37] all right but right here the Bible say
[20:39] we read it last Sunday that there'll be
[20:41] no Temple there'll be no need of a
[20:44] temple
[20:46] because the Tabernacle the Bible says of
[20:48] God is now with who man just like he
[20:51] wanted it before he wanted the
[20:53] Tabernacle he didn't want us to build
[20:54] these outter Court inner Court holy of
[20:56] holies he didn't he he didn't want us to
[20:58] go through the things that we went
[20:59] through but we did because we fell and
[21:02] he was a savior A Healer a redeemer and
[21:04] the only way he can do it was bring us
[21:05] back by that process that's right all
[21:07] right so you your hand up uh in the
[21:10] Millennium the biggest thing to me is
[21:12] right there the Earth is not going to be
[21:14] the same as it is right now no no it'll
[21:16] be burnt over all this stuff will be
[21:19] atmosphere everything else is going to
[21:20] be different yeah so all these other
[21:23] things can come into play right or it
[21:25] never would it wouldn't been you have
[21:28] the only thing I see now you're talking
[21:29] about atmosphere yeah I believe it'll
[21:31] look just like this without a fall right
[21:34] um but I believe if you plant seed it's
[21:36] going to grow yes sunlight's going to
[21:38] make it grow it ain't going to be that
[21:39] you're going to say hey tree now start
[21:41] growing with my finger no in the
[21:44] Millennium is going to be back to like
[21:46] the Garden of Eden was but remember in
[21:49] the Garden of Eden Satan was there right
[21:51] right he just couldn't do anything until
[21:54] Eve done what she
[21:55] did Satan was in the garden IM Meed
[21:58] you believe that sir let's read and
[22:00] let's let's prove that let's go to
[22:03] Ezekiel just came to my mind so let's
[22:06] read
[22:06] it I think it's Ezekiel you have to help
[22:09] me find it 28 20 something or 28 the
[22:13] prince of TI 28 yeah I just read it
[22:18] yesterday this is talking
[22:23] about chapter 28 of Ezekiel if you've
[22:25] never read this before read it there was
[22:28] a man there is a place called Ti t y r e
[22:33] a literal place there was a literal King
[22:36] all right but now listen this
[22:39] King look at verse
[22:41] 13 this natural king of Tyre never was
[22:44] in the Garden of
[22:46] Eden but thou Hast been in Eden the
[22:49] Garden of God so who's he talking about
[22:53] the
[22:54] devil he said you were
[22:56] there
[22:59] but look at
[23:02] 18 thou has defiled thy Sanctuary by the
[23:05] multitude of thine iniquities by the
[23:07] iniquity of thy traffic now this is
[23:09] talking about a natural city which done
[23:11] this cuz remember God destroyed
[23:14] TY but listen therefore will I bring
[23:17] forth a fire from the midst of thee and
[23:19] it shall devour thee and I will bring
[23:21] thee to ashes upon the Earth in sight of
[23:24] all them that behold thee remember in
[23:27] Isaiah
[23:29] we're going to walk by the devil one day
[23:31] and say is this the man right just some
[23:34] little swiveling little shrimp laying on
[23:36] side of a road we're going to say is
[23:38] this the man that brought kingdoms to
[23:40] their knees what talking about the devil
[23:43] right but this is Satan's end verse 19
[23:46] all they that Know Thee among the people
[23:49] shall be astonished at thee Thou shalt
[23:51] be a terror and never shalt thou be
[23:56] anymore and I wrote in my my Bible the
[23:58] end of
[23:59] Satan that's what he is that's the end
[24:01] of Satan now what we got to do is is
[24:03] bring that into our
[24:06] life we bring that into our
[24:09] life that's right and show Satan's end
[24:12] in you and
[24:16] I but there Satan was in that proved
[24:20] that he was in the Garden of
[24:22] Eden but Satan's going to be bound in
[24:24] this
[24:25] Millennium by Chain chain of
[24:28] circumstances that he can't work he was
[24:32] bound by Chain of circumstances in the
[24:33] Garden of Eden until Eve came out from
[24:37] behind the
[24:38] word that proved that man could not keep
[24:42] that Covenant that God said if you do
[24:45] this you'll be okay if you don't do that
[24:47] you'll surely
[24:49] die they did that and died but here in
[24:51] the Millennium to prove the sin Cur
