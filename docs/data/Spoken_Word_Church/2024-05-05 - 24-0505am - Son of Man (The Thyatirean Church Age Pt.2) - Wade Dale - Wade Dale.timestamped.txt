[17:51] to be in the house of the Lord good to
[17:53] have each and every one of you with us
[17:55] uh we did have a good Bible Study last
[17:57] night and everybody parti anticipated
[17:59] everybody that was there that um they
[18:01] told of their favorite scripture and
[18:03] what it meant to them and and um and how
[18:06] it connected to their life and and it
[18:08] was just wonderful to hear each and
[18:09] every one even the kids tell why their
[18:12] scripture was the most favorite one not
[18:13] just read it but tell exactly why that
[18:16] was their favorite scripture and we all
[18:17] have a favorite scripture because it
[18:20] what it connects to us before the
[18:22] foundation of the world God knew as we
[18:23] were talking about last night in the
[18:25] back part of God's mind the vision part
[18:28] of God's mind he saw all this and he
[18:31] orchestrates this to even today us to be
[18:34] here sir so let's make the best of it
[18:38] amen uh we got communion foot washing
[18:41] today this is first Sunday so um brother
[18:45] Aaron will be speaking for us Wednesday
[18:47] night uh on Mother's day which is next
[18:50] Sunday uh brother Bob will be speaking
[18:52] I'll sister Jun and I'll be in Ohio um
[18:55] preaching for them we only have one
[18:57] service next Sunday in the you can go
[18:59] visit your mother or have your mother
[19:00] with you and take her out to
[19:02] eat if you can get in a restaurant one
[19:04] of the busiest days in the restaurant I
[19:05] don't know why youall take your mom out
[19:07] to eat but I guess she have to take her
[19:08] out to eat so she won't have to cook
[19:10] maybe that's what it is so remember that
[19:13] we went to see sister Johnny yesterday
[19:14] and and uh visited her for for a little
[19:17] while before we came to to a Bible study
[19:19] and uh she's in good spirits she still
[19:23] believes that we serve a mighty God even
[19:26] though she's sitting you know laying in
[19:28] a hospital hosital bed she still
[19:29] believes that not a hospital bed but a a
[19:31] rehab facility she still believes it she
[19:34] still believes that God's going to heal
[19:35] her God is the Healer so we're going to
[19:37] believe with her she's going to go with
[19:39] their program she's going to do what the
[19:41] program says the doctor says and then I
[19:44] believe we'll be able to see her again
[19:46] and I appreciate the Lord having doctors
[19:50] that can help our body to be able to
[19:52] heal and uh she's but she's in good
[19:55] spirits she she's tell everybody hello
[19:57] and God bless you and she loves you with
[19:59] the love of the Lord uh also
[20:02] remember um we're going to have a
[20:05] special meeting I told you about it a

[21:53] Bible
[21:54] study and if I can get this new thing to
[21:57] work here we'll have something on the
[21:58] screen but today we're still going to be
[22:00] talking about the th tyan Church age but
[22:03] we're going to talk about there was two
[22:05] things that happened in that church age
[22:07] it was one of the longest Church ages
[22:09] right and it was that it was probably
[22:12] the darkest because there was a lot of
[22:14] killing going on uh physically and
[22:17] spiritually so there was two things that
[22:19] went on during that church age that
[22:20] we're going to talk about that affects
[22:22] us today number one is
[22:24] works and it's all convoluted you know
[22:27] well the works works work no
[22:29] we'll we'll we'll we'll see what the
[22:31] prophet said and what the Bible says
[22:32] about it today because they did God told
[22:35] them he said I Know Thy works all right
[22:38] and then we're going to talk about it's
[22:39] really strange if you read the Bible and
[22:42] read it
[22:44] slow it said God says in the church age
[22:48] he says I will kill them with death
[22:52] right well now if you kill them they're
[22:54] already dead no he said I'll kill them
[22:58] with
[22:59] death
[23:03] right dead and don't know it that's what
[23:06] come out of that church age so let's bow
[23:07] our heads just for a minute dear Lord

[23:11] thank you for the people Lord that's
[23:13] assembled here father that's under this

[23:27] sounding board Lord that people can say
[23:29] that ain't nothing but the truth father
[23:31] we pray that you'd be with the ones that
[23:33] are not here that are sick sister Johnny
[23:34] Sister Mary sister Gail different ones

[23:38] bodies Lord I pray that you'd be with

[24:48] go I've been driven many times to my
[24:51] knees by the overwhelming conviction
[24:53] that I had nowhere else to go on our
[24:57] knees
[25:01] let's read Revelations 1 then we'll get
[25:03] started I was in the spirit on the
[25:04] Lord's day and heard behind me a great
[25:06] voice as it was a trumpet saying I am
[25:08] Alpha and Omega the first and the last
[25:10] that's what we've been talking about
[25:11] well now we're in the middle age all
[25:13] right and what thou see us write in a
[25:15] book and send it to seven churches which
[25:17] are in Asia Ephesus Smyrna pergamus

[25:48] ages
[25:49] about we had the alpha bride and we had
[25:52] the Omega bride and in
[25:55] between oh sorry
[25:59] my son's leading Orchestra Orchestra
[26:01] back
[26:03] there how about that that better okay
[26:07] doie and now we've come to the th Tyrant
[26:10] Church age but we had the two book ends
[26:11] the alpha bride and the Omega bride they
[26:13] mirror images of each other but in
[26:15] between that though go God allowed now
[26:19] listen God allowed man to get involved
[26:21] because he was going to have to restore
[26:23] over
[26:24] here all right he had the full word over
[26:27] here in a group of people but to be to
[26:31] come back as Joel says I will restore
[26:34] all those things there had to be a fall
[26:36] there had to one there had to be a seed
[26:38] go in the ground and die all right to
[26:42] come out into justification
[26:44] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[26:46] and into the fullness of the word that
[26:47] we're into right now all right is
[26:49] everybody with me all right so let's
[26:51] read this this is a long reading but I
[26:53] want you to watch how many times God
[26:55] says works all right revelation 2:18 and
[26:59] to the angel of the church in thyra
[27:01] write these things saith the Son of God
[27:03] who hath his eyes now remember they
[27:05] don't get the son of man Revelation
[27:07] Until the End
[27:09] Time amen but they do have a revelation
[27:12] of the Son of God which is the spirit
[27:14] God the Holy Ghost dwelling inside the
[27:16] people and really in this church age
[27:18] that was about all they
[27:21] had because once you said you were a
[27:23] Christian you didn't live very long all
[27:25] right but they survived
[27:28] they made it through some people made it
[27:30] through as 68 million as Josh was
[27:33] sending me the sent me the the numbers
[27:36] California and Texas two of the biggest
[27:38] states there's 68 somewhat some odat
[27:41] million people in those two states the
[27:44] Catholic Church along with others
[27:47] destroyed obliterated those two states
[27:49] and there were nobody left 68
[27:52] million Christians put to death in that
[27:56] age
[27:58] so let's look at this these things
[28:01] sayith the Son of God who ha its eyes
[28:02] like into what flames of fire and feet
[28:04] like into fine brass I Know Thy works
[28:08] all right there it is I Know Thy works
[28:10] and charity and service and faith and
[28:12] thy patience and thy works there it is
[28:15] again and the last to be more than the
[28:17] first we won't read the rest of it we'll
[28:20] get through the church ages here now
[28:21] remember we were in the church
[28:23] ages and we see that each one of them
[28:26] had a messenger there was a star there
[28:27] was a the messenger come Paul irenius
[28:29] Martin Columba Luther Wesley and then we
[28:32] had the Holy Ghost come on day of
[28:33] Pentecost and then you had the Elijah
[28:35] anointing for the end time all right
[28:37] everybody with me on that I just really
[28:38] appreciate what our brother said this
[28:41] past Wednesday night that was a good
[28:43] message there putting Elisha and it
[28:45] types us and that's who we are we're the
[28:47] Elisha we have the Elijah anointing but
[28:50] Elisha typed the brides what brother
[28:52] random said all right but you and I are
[28:54] now in this L of and age but the th
[28:58] iring age was the fourth age and it was
[29:00] the longest age from 606 to 1520 and
[29:03] then what happened was now in Ephesus
[29:06] smna pergamus there was a full word of
[29:08] God and then man got involved man got
[29:11] involved man got involved man man got
[29:15] involved and it was it was so-called
[29:17] Christian men got involved it wasn't and
[29:20] yes it was the Devil Himself but he was
[29:23] disguised as the word of the hour for
[29:26] the day everybody with me that sound
[29:29] familiar all right he's disguised
[29:32] himself today in the word of the day but
[29:34] today remember today is the
[29:37] Apex today he is going to sit on a
[29:40] throne here on Earth and be called
[29:45] God but it started in infancy back
[29:48] there I was looking at some old notes
[29:51] and and I'll bring it out maybe later on
[29:53] but you know in James it says when lust
[29:55] is conceived it brings forth sin
[29:58] When sin is finished it bringeth forth
[30:02] death when it's finished you got those
[30:04] four stages to go through if you cut
[30:05] them off in either one of those you know
[30:07] because we all sin as we were talking
[30:09] last night we're Sinners saved by grace
[30:12] but by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[30:14] your soul your soul can't sin anymore
[30:17] never can never will nothing be held
[30:19] against you so if you do sin it's in
[30:20] your spirit realm and you allow it to
[30:25] happen well the devil made me do it well
[30:27] I think we blame him a little too
[30:30] much cuz you're a free moral agent right
[30:33] you can do whatever you want to do
[30:35] you're a free moral
[30:36] agent and you
[30:38] do and you say the devil made me do it
[30:41] well let's talk about that a little bit
[30:43] more no he didn't you did it
[30:48] right let me get rid of this so now
[30:51] remember everything happens the lap over
[30:54] is the Grace from one age to the other
[30:56] so you got you got the first three ages
[30:59] you've got actually St Patrick was not a
[31:02] church age messenger but in the th tyan
[31:04] Church age he was born of St Martin's
[31:07] sister so there was a connection there
[31:09] between the church age messenger before
[31:11] that and the pergan church age then you
[31:13] had um St Patrick comes in and then St
[31:16] Patrick passes away and then Here Comes
[31:18] Columba so Columba is a messenger to
[31:20] this age all right and he was born in
[31:22] Donal Ireland where brother George
[31:24] Quinn's from but in that lap over there
[31:27] was something happened even the good
[31:30] happened but even the evil happened
[31:33] there was a ni seeeing counsil there was
[31:35] people getting together saying oh he was
[31:37] not God he was a likee substance or or
[31:40] he couldn't be this and couldn't be that
[31:42] and and the idea of a trinitarian
[31:44] Doctrine came up an idea of a of a
[31:46] father son Holy Ghost baptism came up
[31:49] right in that lap over and then the
[31:51] church age comes but from the pergan
[31:54] church age it look it's it's called it
[31:56] means thoroughly married
[31:59] so so as Christ and the bride are
[32:02] married so is Satan and his bride are
[32:04] married thoroughly married listen it
[32:07] wasn't get me let me H let me talk let
[32:10] me say this it wasn't bad when a Ahab
[32:13] was on Earth and Jezebel was on
[32:15] Earth it's when they come
[32:18] together it's when they come together is
[32:20] when the Havoc happened the murder began
[32:22] to
[32:23] happen it's when they thoroughly married
[32:26] when they when church and state
[32:27] thoroughly married under Constantine
[32:29] that's when the problem started if
[32:31] you'll look in history though they think
[32:32] Constantine's a really good guy he
[32:34] created The Crusade and he had the the
[32:36] cross backs and all those things he was
[32:39] a
[32:40] deceiver he was the one that brought it
[32:42] down and he brought it down under the
[32:44] ospice of making religion P more
[32:47] powerful sure it's true religion was
[32:51] more
[32:54] powerful I said religion
[32:58] whose religion you talking
[33:00] about the devil's religion cuz they were
[33:03] thoroughly married during that pergan
[33:05] church age and then it carried right on
[33:07] over into the tharan church age this one
[33:10] lasted from 3:12 to 606 and remember the
[33:13] council 9A was 325 ad and that's when
[33:17] they began to come together all right is
[33:20] everybody with me and during that age
[33:23] there was some that held fast the name
[33:25] and then we're going to see we know
[33:27] where Satan is we know where Satan
[33:30] dwelleth but I have a few things against
[33:32] you because thou Hast there in them that
[33:34] hold that doctrine of
[33:36] balum which was what
[33:39] trickery it was trickery under the opice
[33:43] that we were going to be better off if
[33:45] you put these two together right listen
[33:49] remember there's one God that's right
[33:52] and one God with one bride doesn't make
[33:55] two one God with one bride make one yes
[33:58] sir if you got two brother Brown said
[34:00] anywhere you got two one's God one's the
[34:03] devil all
[34:05] right who taught Bop to cast a stumbling
[34:08] block before the children of Israel to
[34:09] eat things sacrifice the idols and
[34:11] commit fornication so hast thou also
[34:13] them that hold the doctrine now it
[34:15] becomes a Doctrine a doctrine of the
[34:16] nicians it's something that now is
[34:18] preached it's not hidden in a corner
[34:20] somewhere it's being preached from a
[34:22] pull Pit All right so they've come and
[34:24] brought it to the pull pit and what have
[34:26] they brought they brought a Doctrine
[34:28] that was
[34:29] false and God hated it but remember it
[34:32] wasn't that he couldn't do anything
[34:34] about it God allowed this to happen so
[34:37] that this next Church age everything
[34:39] could fall in the ground cuz by that
[34:42] time everything was gone in the fourth
[34:44] Church age there was nothing much of the
[34:46] first three ages in that fourth Church
[34:49] age cuz man had got involved Rome had
[34:52] got
[34:53] involved right right but there still was
[34:56] a group of people out of all that made
[35:00] it out of all that they made it you come
[35:03] to church today if they came to church
[35:06] during their time and they got caught
[35:08] they
[35:10] died
[35:12] right and they'd throw you in the lines
[35:16] then but now God told them in that third
[35:19] Church age he said repent or else I will
[35:22] come unto thee quickly and fight against
[35:24] them with a sword of my mouth there was
[35:25] a group of people that did that that
[35:27] fought against it in every age there is
[35:30] a true
[35:31] bride every age there's truth but now
[35:34] remember remember in every age there's
[35:36] faults
[35:38] too that's the law of
[35:40] contrast so the pergan church age
[35:42] brother R said Look by the time this
[35:44] third Church age we have two churches
[35:47] bearing the same name but with a bitter
[35:51] difference between them one has departed
[35:54] from the truth that's what we're going
[35:56] to get into this afternoon afternoon and
[35:59] as I was telling last night we kind of
[36:00] touched on it a little
[36:02] bit the denominational system is what's
[36:07] dead now there's people that'll be given
[36:09] eternal life there's people that'll come
[36:11] out of that but the system is dead now
[36:14] when it's dead it don't come
[36:16] back that's why brother R said he said
[36:19] read that again I will kill them with
[36:24] death death killing death you think well
[36:28] that's not right well we'll look at this
[36:29] afternoon we'll see that it's absolutely
[36:31] the
[36:33] truth we have two churches bearing the
[36:35] same name but with a bitter difference
[36:36] between them one has departed from the
[36:38] truth married idols and has no life in
[36:42] her that really is what the definition
[36:45] of dead means you have no life she has
[36:49] hybridized herself and the signs of
[36:51] death that's what we'll talk about this
[36:53] afternoon the signs of death not life
[36:55] follow in her wake but now if you look
[36:58] on the outside and looked in your
[37:00] history books they started making big
[37:02] Cathedrals they started putting up as
[37:04] brother Bob and different ones saying
[37:05] you you look at these great big churches
[37:06] you say how in the world do they even
[37:09] pay the power
[37:12] bill the pipe organs you know millions
[37:15] of dollars just so you can play so it
[37:17] sounds
[37:18] good but they're
[37:21] dead the Bible says you're dead while
[37:23] you're
[37:24] alive and if that darkness in you if
[37:27] that that light in you that you think
[37:28] you have be Darkness how great is that
[37:30] Darkness think about that in our life
[37:33] let's get that part of the darkness out
[37:35] that we think is light we think we're
[37:37] okay let's don't ever think we're okay
[37:40] right let God tell us we're okay as we
[37:43] were talking last night we're going to
[37:45] be sticky right up to the change that's
[37:47] right we're going to be old those of us
[37:50] that are old are going to be old right
[37:52] up to the
[37:56] change but praise God what a change
[38:00] that'll
[38:01] be as we were talking last night in th
[38:03] Thessalonians somebody asked a question
[38:05] about that we got to get the dead out of
[38:07] the ground the Dead's got to come back
[38:08] before we take a Rapture so don't be
[38:10] talking about a Rapture be talking about
[38:13] a message of
[38:15] Resurrection the same loud voice that
[38:17] called ra Lazarus from the grave is
[38:19] going to speak through us one
[38:22] day maybe sooner than we think but the
[38:26] dead in Christ shall rise
[38:31] first she is powerful with many members
[38:35] she is favored by the
[38:38] world is that but God says no God says
[38:42] separate from that God said if you love
[38:45] the world the things of the world love
[38:46] of the father is not in you all right
[38:48] she is favored by the world the other is
[38:50] a little persecuted group but she
[38:53] follows the word
[38:55] yes and the signs follow her the sick
[39:00] are healed the dead are raised I was
[39:01] reading about Columban and many things
[39:03] in his life as I was reading on the
[39:05] internet one guy he was like this just
[39:08] can't
[39:09] be they've exaggerated his
[39:12] life brother R said he didn't read that
[39:15] but brother R said he was solid he
[39:17] healed the sick raised the Dead uh
[39:20] walked up to a a big old stone wall one
[39:22] time that had Gates and they wouldn't
[39:24] let him in the city and he just turned
[39:25] around walked away and something said
[39:27] turn back around and the gates open and
[39:29] what happened was one of the guys inside
[39:31] one of the Chiefs or something his son
[39:34] fell
[39:35] dead and they called him in to pray for
[39:38] him and he converted a whole bunch of
[39:39] people there that's how God works That's
[39:41] how little
[39:42] Columba got around and then Columbo
[39:45] would take 10 or 12 of his monks and he
[39:47] would go to an island or go to a place
[39:50] and he would build a
[39:51] city there's an island over there called
[39:54] high Hy over in Ireland now and was the
[39:57] worst Island there was nothing growing
[39:59] there was no habitation and they said
[40:01] now it's the most Lush
[40:04] Island in
[40:06] Ireland three miles long and a couple
[40:08] miles wide a little bitty Island but
[40:11] it's called the island of Columba
[40:13] because he went there took his monks
[40:15] there and it flourished now under his
[40:17] ministry but what he would do he would
[40:18] teach those monks and then send them out
[40:20] and they converted in in Ireland and and
[40:23] different countries like that Scotland
[40:25] and all that in the UK is where Columba
[40:28] did his
[40:29] work the sick are healed the dead are
[40:31] raised she is alive with life in the
[40:32] word of God she loves not her life now
[40:35] that's that's the group of people coming
[40:36] up that they love not their life unto
[40:38] death but holds to his name and his
[40:40] faith even unto
[40:42] death now come on folks you and I have
[40:45] not been through that
[40:48] before these people may have persecuted
[40:50] for what you believe are persecuted
[40:52] because you wear pants or don't wear
[40:54] pants men wear pants and and not shorts
[40:56] and women wear dresses and and U you''ll
[40:59] be persecuted for that but not to kill
[41:03] you that's right these people were
[41:05] listen these people were Christians and
[41:07] they didn't dress one way and the others
[41:09] dress another way they all dressed the
[41:12] same back then you didn't have to worry
[41:13] about a woman wearing pants she didn't
[41:15] have none on but it was what it was the
[41:18] life they lived it was they they went to
[41:20] church they served God they were
[41:23] different we got to be
[41:26] different God's going to only one to
[41:28] make you different though cuz you can
[41:29] think you're different but all of a
[41:31] sudden one day you're going to be just
[41:32] like the world if you don't have what's
[41:33] inside of you to make you
[41:36] different and that's where these four
[41:37] living creatures and we'll get back on
[41:39] to them when we start on the seals and
[41:41] and and bring out a little bit more but
[41:43] remember in Revelations 4:6 there were
[41:45] four beasts full of eyes before and
[41:47] behind and the first Beast was a lion
[41:49] second was a calf third was a face of a
[41:51] man and then we are in the now Eagle
[41:54] anointing age the flying eagle and and
[41:57] listen it's like I said before a lion
[41:59] when it's born it has to have milk now
[42:02] it's going to be a meat eater but it has
[42:04] to have milk right a calf when it's born
[42:08] it's a grass eater but it drinks milk
[42:11] first several years or months of its
[42:14] life and then we don't start feeding
[42:17] little U little Ava don't is not going
[42:19] to eat a steak
[42:20] today okay she might she's a little bit
[42:22] older but you're not going to feed a
[42:23] baby you're going to feed it what
[42:25] milk and even Paul talks about the
[42:27] sincere milk of the word we all have to
[42:30] grow as babies do look at the life of
[42:33] the ba of you look at your life and
[42:36] that's the way your Christian life grows
[42:38] that's the way I can see
[42:40] it right right by your life by my
[42:45] life pretty
[42:48] simple it's like brother Bob said they
[42:50] we know when the Bible says no man don't
[42:53] need no man to teach you anything or
[42:54] brother brandom said that that don't
[42:56] mean that you can s
[42:58] home we shouldn't have to be told not to
[43:01] commit
[43:01] adultery if you're a Christian you
[43:04] won't we're not to be told don't we're
[43:06] not to be told now don't y'all
[43:09] steal there something wrong with you if
[43:11] you if you're still stealing in
[43:13] cursing or cursing cursings in the
[43:17] South but if you're still doing that
[43:20] then you don't have the giver inside of
[43:22] you that'll give you deliverance from
[43:24] that everybody with me it's pretty
[43:28] plain it's like your brother said you
[43:30] don't have to tell a Christian to come
[43:32] to church it's only the Sinners and
[43:34] unbelievers that you have to tell to
[43:35] come to church well praise the Lord
[43:38] anyhow CU listen a born again Christian
[43:41] will do what the Bible says without
[43:44] somebody teaching them every Sunday to
[43:46] do
[43:48] it now as far as growing up in God yes
[43:51] we need Apostles prophets pastors
[43:53] teachers because the Bible says for the
[43:54] perfecting of the Saints not to make you
[43:56] a
[44:00] saint but to perfect you as a saint to
[44:05] help you walk and this right here the
[44:07] lion ox or calf the man the man
[44:11] intelligent but as intelligent as man is
[44:14] like I said before take a bottle you
[44:17] drink a bottle when you get
[44:19] started we don't want to do that when
[44:21] we're a little
[44:22] older we get away from those things Paul
[44:25] said not going back to that but grow up
[44:28] all right and then a flying eagle
[44:31] doesn't have any milk
[44:34] glands it definitely starts out eating
[44:37] meat so in this church age brother rown
[44:39] called us Little Eagles
[44:42] Messi all the different things where
[44:44] she's a she's a supernatural group of
[44:46] people she only responds to
[44:50] Revelation she loves
[44:52] Revelation she loves this message of the
[44:56] hour and that's the Flying Eagle because
[44:58] what Mama Eagle does is she kills this
[45:00] big rabbit brings it over there now she
[45:02] doesn't stuff that rabbit down the throw
[45:04] of that of that eagle it'll choke it so
[45:08] what does she do she breaks it down
[45:09] every Sunday and Wednesday praise the
[45:11] Lord breaks it down and then takes and
[45:14] puts little bits in his mouth and then
[45:16] when that eagle grows he's like rabbit
[45:19] equals
[45:21] food amen same way with the word of God
[45:24] equals food right not a drudgery not I
[45:28] have to if I don't come to church
[45:30] brother Way's going
[45:31] to I hope you didn't come here to see me
[45:34] I hope you come here to find a word of
[45:36] God for your life but it had to be done
[45:39] through the foolishness of preaching
[45:41] sorry about that but God must have
[45:43] thought it the best way to do it or he'd
[45:44] have picked another one amen so cuz I I
[45:48] believe don't we believe God will never
[45:49] make a mistake right he don't make
[45:50] mistakes right okay I just thought we
[45:52] was in the same group all right so the
[45:54] four Beast had one of six wings they
[45:56] were full of
[45:57] they rest not day or night saying holy
[45:59] holy holy Lord God Almighty which was
[46:00] and is and is to come and these living
[46:03] creatures living creatures they're
[46:05] called zooms are living beings they're
[46:08] not theion beasts which come up in the
[46:10] Book of Revelations 13 and the different
[46:13] places 1113 and 17 those are untameable
[46:17] theory on Beast which
[46:20] are you see them working
[46:24] now isn't that an untameable world out
[46:27] there
[46:29] yes you can't tame that world brother R
[46:32] said you put a you put Abraham Lincoln
[46:33] and George Washington in the every seat
[46:36] in the house and the Senate and even in
[46:37] the in the White House you can't turn
[46:39] this thing around Satan has got his hand
[46:42] so far into what not the political
[46:44] listen politics is horrible right but
[46:48] what's going to kill us the people in
[46:51] the religion the people in the churches
[46:53] the people in denominations that's
[46:55] what's going to kill us don't worry
[46:57] about President whoever gets to be the
[46:59] next president he's just a puppet
[47:01] anyway I was reading about a family the
[47:04] other day and and they're worth over $2
[47:06] trillion dollar and we don't even know
[47:08] who they
[47:08] are Jeff bezo is worth 145 billion well
[47:12] now a trillion is 10 times that and it
[47:15] or 100 10 or anyway 2 point something
[47:18] trillion dollars this
[47:20] family and no even know their name we
[47:23] know it's the Roth Charles and the
[47:24] different ones that you know all those
[47:26] uh things that from back when but
[47:28] they've all changed their name now so
[47:30] they don't know who they are but they're
[47:31] running the
[47:33] world money women and popularity that's
[47:36] what's running this nation
[47:38] too right everybody wants to be
[47:42] popular we want to be the great United
[47:44] States of America that that runs the
[47:46] world and we
[47:47] will we have great military
[47:50] power I love
[47:53] Israel my goodness that little old
[47:56] country that ain't much bigger than
[47:57] Rhode
[47:58] Island they snuck about 25 or 30 of
[48:01] their missiles went through Syria went
[48:05] through part of
[48:06] Iraq and hit Iran's defense system and
[48:09] nobody caught him on
[48:12] radar not one person you know what
[48:15] Israel said there's more to come big boy
[48:19] Israel said you throw some more over
[48:20] this
[48:21] way you know we just threw those over
[48:24] there and you didn't even know where
[48:25] they were coming from they got so so
[48:26] much technology that no not one radar
[48:29] system picked it up between three
[48:31] countries and it hit their air defense
[48:34] system so Israel was just giving them a
[48:36] little what they call it a shot across
[48:37] the bow said hey you send them over
[48:40] here and even one guy I was reading it
[48:43] yesterday one guy
[48:45] said Iran you made a horrible mistake
[48:49] said we're not coming he said we got
[48:51] people already
[48:53] there so they got people within already
[48:56] that's
[48:58] praise God he takes care of his own
[49:01] Israel may have been divorced Israel may
[49:03] but he said I'll never forget her I'll
[49:06] never forget Israel and Israel will be
[49:09] there right there with us the
[49:12] 144,000 but that theory on Beast that
[49:15] that characteristic is is right now but
[49:18] it's all going to head up in what one
[49:22] the Antichrist and the world is you can
[49:25] read all over the Internet what say the
[49:27] Antichrist is Trump the Antichrist is
[49:29] Biden the Antichrist is that set of
[49:34] drums they're living in the system of
[49:38] antichrist and don't even know it
[49:40] they're think it's something outside
[49:42] lessen let's don't think of the evil
[49:44] outside let's get rid of the evil
[49:46] inside let's get rid of us yes sir get
[49:49] us out of the way and let God bring his
[49:52] bombs in and knock all that out of the
[49:54] way for us not worry about I don't worry
[49:57] about what the Baptists are doing I
[49:59] really don't worry about what Israel's
[50:00] doing but it's fascinating to see one
[50:02] little bitty
[50:04] country that everybody hates except a
[50:07] few and when we start hating them it's
[50:09] going to be terrible on
[50:10] us but they've got enough technology to
[50:13] send 16 or 18 of their missiles right
[50:16] through everybody's defense system and
[50:17] never knew it that'll make you almost
[50:20] cry I mean come on
[50:22] people that technology came from God to
[50:25] those people to ser
[50:28] survive if not listen if it wasn't for
[50:30] God's hand Israel wouldn't be here today
[50:32] that's right so God's hand is in all
[50:35] that he's let those missiles go
[50:38] through he give them the
[50:41] technology you say well America's
[50:43] helping them well America helps some but
[50:44] I'm going to tell you something Israel's
[50:46] a country of its
[50:48] own and it's got its own way of doing
[50:50] things if you'll notice it doesn't have
[50:52] to go through Congress and the Senate
[50:54] and go through a stinking president
[50:56] before they they drop bombs they drop
[50:58] bombs and then let you know about it
[51:00] later I like
[51:04] that but these beasts are wild Untamed
[51:07] Savages look at all the killings that's
[51:09] going on mass murders everywhere that's
[51:13] that theory on beast in that system but
[51:16] I'm talking about the theory on beast
[51:17] that's inside of the system working
[51:21] trying to get me and you what off
[51:24] course trying to get me and you just one
[51:27] crack just one one crack that's why the
[51:31] Bible says
[51:33] compacted compact this thing down to
[51:36] where Satan can't get in because listen
[51:38] if he ever if he ever gets a foothold he
[51:40] can get in we know that cuz that happens
[51:43] to us
[51:46] amen but untameable Beast are is all
[51:50] that
[51:51] black but it heads up in the end time in
[51:54] a man that the World believes is their
[51:58] savior
[51:59] finally all right going to save
[52:02] everybody but what he's going to do he's
[52:03] going to destroy everything that b of
[52:06] Armageddon he's going to destroy
[52:08] everything he's going to go to Israel
[52:11] he's going to kill the
[52:12] 144,000 he's not going to do it
[52:14] personally but he's going to do it
[52:15] through his system it's a system so I
[52:18] said we're not an organization we're an
[52:20] organism a living working organism not
[52:23] an organization
[52:27] he all right everybody with
[52:29] me so there's your lion ox man and Eagle
[52:32] the first three Ages was the lion age
[52:34] the ox age we're getting ready to talk
[52:36] about the man age is coming up with
[52:38] Luther and Wesley and then the eagle age
[52:40] is the age that you and I are in that
[52:42] flies higher that we start we we we get
[52:45] born again and then we do desire the
[52:47] sincere milk of the word but to grow
[52:50] thereby Paul said but leaving those
[52:52] principles we got to go on to Perfection
[52:55] we got to eat some rabbit
[52:57] we got to eat some
[53:07] chicken it's going to take these four
[53:10] beasts listen it's going to take these
[53:12] four beasts to open the
[53:14] seals I know Jesus Christ open the seals
[53:16] but who is he he is those four beasts I
[53:19] saw when the lamb opened one of the
[53:20] seals I heard it where the noise of
[53:21] thunder and John's just standing there
[53:24] in awe but one of the four Beast says
[53:27] come here John I want to show you
[53:29] something I want to show you something
[53:32] special I want to expose the Antichrist
[53:35] to you even in this first church age
[53:38] that's what that lion anointing did the
[53:40] lion called out and said come and see
[53:43] John then the next age what was it come
[53:45] and see John the ox age then you got
[53:48] come and see John the man come and see
[53:50] the eagle age and then they left and we
[53:54] left we leave with them
[53:57] everybody with
[53:59] me then we talked about the scene there
[54:01] in Revelations where the first of the
[54:03] throne is first at this Throne is four
[54:06] living creatures we know there's one
[54:07] Throne one sitting on the throne all
[54:09] right outside of that is 24 Elders
[54:12] sitting upon the throne upon their
[54:13] Thrones brother Brown said around this
[54:15] is a great host of angels see what I
[54:18] mean they're everyone different one from
[54:19] the other there's Angels elders and here
[54:22] is living creatures because those four
[54:23] living creatures were there in that
[54:25] scene listen wherever the bride's at is
[54:28] where the is where those four beasts are
[54:30] going to be four living creatures that's
[54:33] what you need every day you need the
[54:34] boldness of a line to be able to talk
[54:36] the word of God and say this is where
[54:38] God said it and I believe it you show me
[54:40] where he took it
[54:42] out then the ox you got to be able to
[54:45] labor with somebody have patience that's
[54:49] why patience is right
[54:52] here that's about that middle age you
[54:54] get in there where you look and see that
[54:56] you need the ox to get through and then
[54:58] you got to have the intelligence of the
[55:00] man as we were talking last
[55:03] night you got to know what it's
[55:06] somebody's quot you know brother Dale
[55:07] always said I don't know how to quote
[55:09] all the scripture he said but I know
[55:11] somebody that can or I know how to find
[55:12] it in other words he's got he's got he
[55:14] get information well that's what the man
[55:16] anointing is a man anointing is what if
[55:19] man came down if man came here that
[55:21] anointing came to put this thing
[55:23] together and remember we were talking
[55:25] about tendale tendale they killed him
[55:27] they druged him through the street and
[55:28] killed him for writing the Bible or for
[55:30] putting it
[55:31] together look what they went through
[55:34] just to get this thing to us but the man
[55:37] anointing allowed them to do that print
[55:39] and presses and all these different
[55:40] things but remember that man anointing
[55:43] also created cars guns
[55:46] yes which kill more people than anything
[55:48] that's right so you got to know which
[55:51] side you're on and then the eagle
[55:53] anointing as you're flying higher this
[55:55] is one thing see Satan can imitate all
[55:57] those other
[55:59] ones but he can imitate the eagle he can
[56:02] to a point remember brother R said the
[56:04] the crow can go so
[56:06] far hello yeah the the hawk can go so
[56:11] far the devil can go so far but there's
[56:15] a Time folks right now in this end time
[56:19] where we are to be Untouchable in the
[56:21] word of God we're to be where Satan
[56:23] can't do anything with us because we
[56:26] have so much of the word of God we're
[56:28] wrapped so much into this Spirit of the
[56:30] of not the spirit of that age but the
[56:32] spirit of this age the eagle anointing
[56:34] they come to us through a
[56:36] prophet that Shields us and we know how
[56:38] to use this thing right
[56:42] here Paul said by reason of
[56:45] use is your senses
[56:48] exercised you want big muscles sit
[56:51] around and eat tear
[56:54] chips you have big muscles work
[56:57] out
[57:00] exercise your listen every one of you
[57:03] sitting in here today like we talk about
[57:06] this morning or yesterday
[57:08] afternoon and and and if you wasn't
[57:10] there I W wish you would listen to watch
[57:12] it because you take every one of those
[57:14] people there were 30 or more people in
[57:15] that room everyone now there was a
[57:18] couple maybe had the same scripture but
[57:19] there was from
[57:21] habca to Isaiah to
[57:24] Malachi to job to
[57:29] Esther it was the whole plethora of it
[57:31] wasn't just like we all believe Malachi
[57:33] 4 well we do all believe in Malachi 4
[57:36] but we also believe in Revelations 10 as
[57:39] as that was uh brother luis's favorite
[57:41] not
[57:42] 107 108 through 12 because it what it
[57:46] identifies us with it but in the days of
[57:49] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[57:51] begins to sound the mystery of God to be
[57:53] finished and then John says give me the
[57:55] book and the book's open all right give
[57:59] it to me John said John didn't say now
[58:02] if I'm
[58:05] worthy
[58:07] no and he didn't take it from the
[58:09] seventh angel messenger either he took
[58:11] it from the mighty Angel you and I now
[58:15] listen to me brother brandom's off the
[58:16] scene we don't have to go through him to
[58:19] get to
[58:21] God we go through his message to get to
[58:24] God but we don't have to go through him
[58:26] him to get to God he's not our
[58:28] intercessor God is our intercessor the
[58:31] Holy Ghost is our
[58:33] intercessor listen if you want Power get
[58:35] the Holy Ghost if you want to solve some
[58:39] of your problems get the Holy Ghost if
[58:41] you want to live a better life get the
[58:42] Holy Ghost if you want your kids to grow
[58:45] up better get the Holy Ghost and show it
[58:47] to
[58:48] them it all hinges on the Holy Ghost yes
[58:52] sir those four living creatures living
[58:54] inside of you listen there's a life
[58:57] inside of a life we live a human life we
[58:59] have children we do the things of
[59:02] man sorry we go to work we eat we
[59:06] breathe but there's something inside of
[59:08] you that's way different than
[59:11] that and as we were talking about last
[59:13] night here's the deal sin was so bad and
[59:18] sin was so contrary to God everybody
[59:22] with me till Even Adam
[59:27] who had the Holy Ghost in his soul
[59:29] remember he had eternal life in his soul
[59:32] he bypassed
[59:36] that cuz he knew what he was
[59:39] doing he bypassed that into his Spirit
[59:41] realm and then what he what happened
[59:43] memory reason conscious faction
[59:44] imagination his affection took over sir
[59:48] and to save Eve absolutely to save Eve
[59:51] he took her yes not to have sex with her
[59:54] but he took her to himself he said God
[59:57] don't kill her you'll have to kill me
[59:59] what's the thing listen all down Through
[1:00:00] the Ages you look at Moses he said God
[1:00:02] if you got to kill them you got to kill
[1:00:06] me what brother randam
[1:00:09] say he said
[1:00:11] God I got him my own a
[1:00:15] limb Pok word Original Seed and I don't
[1:00:18] know what to
[1:00:20] do Holy Ghost said pick up your pen and
[1:00:23] write said as of yet m
[1:00:26] for not been made known or fulfilled so
[1:00:30] he knew his message had to go longer
[1:00:33] everybody with me that's just real
[1:00:34] simple to see that that that brother
[1:00:36] Brown thought he preached it all he
[1:00:38] thought he had done it all he thought he
[1:00:39] had brought us to a point which he did
[1:00:42] he brought us back to that mirror image
[1:00:43] of the first church
[1:00:45] age restored the gifts tied up the Loose
[1:00:48] Ends brought all that back to
[1:00:51] he but the book was still closed
[1:00:58] the book had to be open the seals had to
[1:01:00] be broke so that you and i' have a
[1:01:02] chance to sit here today and take a body
[1:01:06] change without that you
[1:01:08] can't denominations can't bring it
[1:01:11] they're
[1:01:12] hybridized right they got too much of
[1:01:15] their own
[1:01:16] ideas do we have too much of our own
[1:01:19] ideas we can be a denomination of our
[1:01:21] own self if we don't watch
[1:01:24] it but see was so
[1:01:27] bad don't we ask you a question as I
[1:01:30] asked him last
[1:01:32] night how many had a bad thought today
[1:01:35] oh raise your hand you just had one
[1:01:38] now against me
[1:01:43] H right brother
[1:01:45] Kylie now where'd that come
[1:01:48] from if you're born again today where'd
[1:01:50] that come from it didn't come from God
[1:01:54] it didn't come from your soul it came
[1:01:56] from your emotion your spirit realm it
[1:01:59] overrode what the Holy Ghost could do if
[1:02:01] you just listen to it oh yeah come on
[1:02:04] people we don't sin in our soul if we're
[1:02:06] born again you don't sin in your flesh
[1:02:09] if you're born again you sin in your
[1:02:11] spirit your body just does this just
[1:02:13] does what's told it to
[1:02:17] do we've got that Holy Ghost so bound
[1:02:20] brother said the Holy Ghost has been
[1:02:22] bound for 2,000 years not because of
[1:02:26] anything but misinterpreted theology or
[1:02:29] denomination or man's own ideas that's
[1:02:31] how it was
[1:02:33] bound but he said but in the end time
[1:02:35] it's been loosed by the seventh angel
[1:02:37] message praise God we're underneath that
[1:02:40] praise God we're a part of that we just
[1:02:42] got to reach out and get it let that
[1:02:43] Soul
[1:02:45] work let it take over
[1:02:48] right but we don't but we're working on
[1:02:52] it
[1:02:56] so we got the lonox man and Eagle we
[1:02:57] know what each one of them were and we
[1:02:59] kind of give you the the little little
[1:03:01] drawing there of how the lonox man an
[1:03:04] eagle kind of strange that the line of
[1:03:06] the tribe of Judah is on the
[1:03:08] East I wonder who he's talking about
[1:03:10] Jesus said I'll come from the East all
[1:03:13] right then you've got down at the bottom
[1:03:15] Reuben which was the which is the man
[1:03:17] anointing and he was the first one born
[1:03:19] of the
[1:03:20] Patriarchs of the 12 then you got the ox
[1:03:24] age over there in the west and then you
[1:03:25] got the eagle anointing at the top which
[1:03:27] is Dan and that's at the North pretty
[1:03:29] good Eagle anointing up here but they
[1:03:33] protected what the mercy seed so now
[1:03:36] where is that Mercy Seat listen that
[1:03:38] Tabernacle has been
[1:03:40] destroyed all right it's been destroyed
[1:03:42] it's laying somewhere in Israel or
[1:03:44] somewhere in Iraq or Iran or
[1:03:46] somewhere and America is now helping
[1:03:49] them get the red heer which they have
[1:03:53] several more than just a few now they
[1:03:55] have
[1:03:56] that they deal that they work with but
[1:03:59] you got to have that you got to have
[1:04:00] they have to go through steps as we
[1:04:03] we're going to talk about this afternoon
[1:04:05] under the law you have to go by the
[1:04:08] law if you're not born again today you
[1:04:11] are under the law yes you are under dos
[1:04:14] and don'ts
[1:04:16] right but the Bible says we're free from
[1:04:19] the law of sin and death we're going to
[1:04:22] read it I didn't think I didn't know so
[1:04:24] Much Death was in the Old Testament till
[1:04:25] I got to reading it the other day I had
[1:04:27] to just scratch the surface I mean if
[1:04:30] you if you if you killed a man certain
[1:04:32] thing you died if
[1:04:36] you if you worked on the Sabbath you
[1:04:38] died it wasn't that they smacked you on
[1:04:40] the hand saying they don't you do that
[1:04:42] no more you died died
[1:04:48] dead so what I mean about
[1:04:52] death Bible say death has no more
[1:04:54] dominion over us we were born under the
[1:04:56] law we know that Jesus Christ was born
[1:04:58] under the law but what he did he
[1:05:01] redeemed us from the curse of the law he
[1:05:04] didn't do away with the
[1:05:05] law he didn't do away with the law he
[1:05:08] couldn't cause the law having a shadow
[1:05:11] of things to come we'll get well we'll
[1:05:12] get to it this afternoon I'm message
[1:05:15] today so those Temple guards it's the
[1:05:17] Holy Ghost guarding what that Temple you
[1:05:20] are the Temple of the Holy Ghost yes sir
[1:05:22] and those
[1:05:23] four living creatures
[1:05:26] creatures not dead
[1:05:28] ideas those four living creatures help
[1:05:31] you through life if you'll let it help
[1:05:33] you
[1:05:35] through listen who's your worst
[1:05:40] enemy you said
[1:05:42] me brother already said me he so he said
[1:05:46] me so it's
[1:05:50] me your worst enemy is
[1:05:53] you that's our worst enemy that's who we
[1:05:56] we fight with that man every day if you
[1:05:59] don't fight you need the Holy Ghost then
[1:06:02] the fight
[1:06:04] begins I mean a real fight a
[1:06:07] struggle but praise God for those that
[1:06:09] went through that praise God for these
[1:06:11] people went through this church age and
[1:06:13] come out of
[1:06:15] it cuz some of them had to make it to
[1:06:18] the lap over so that Luther's age could
[1:06:21] take over and take us into the
[1:06:23] justification and then sanctification in
[1:06:25] the baptism my Holy Ghost everybody with
[1:06:26] me all right so the th tyan Church age
[1:06:30] was 606 to 1520 very long Church age it
[1:06:34] last for 900 years and listen that 900
[1:06:37] years was
[1:06:38] killing physically killing Christians
[1:06:41] because they said they were Christian
[1:06:43] and not a
[1:06:45] Catholic that's why they call it the
[1:06:47] Dark Ages that's why the ox anointing it
[1:06:49] just it was a labor to make it through
[1:06:51] but we'll look at that in just for a
[1:06:52] minute cuz remember the ox is slow but
[1:06:56] still
[1:06:57] works sir come on the ox are slow but it
[1:07:00] still
[1:07:02] works you really don't see you don't see
[1:07:04] horses now you might have years ago but
[1:07:07] mostly it was
[1:07:08] mules donkeys and Ox cuz they walk but
[1:07:12] they're powerful you don't want to race
[1:07:15] horse and get behind it with a with a
[1:07:18] plow they call that
[1:07:22] dragging they call that getting drugg
[1:07:24] all right but if you got an ox you just
[1:07:26] kind of get the gate and you walk
[1:07:28] through get the Gate of the of the
[1:07:30] animal and you walk through that's what
[1:07:31] this this age was it it was a powerful
[1:07:34] age in that they made it through but it
[1:07:35] was a long age that they had to depend
[1:07:37] on even Columba their messenger listen
[1:07:40] we rever our Messer amen and we're lucky
[1:07:43] enough and fortunate enough to have it
[1:07:45] in tape and book form amen they didn't
[1:07:48] Columbo was already dead before this Ox
[1:07:51] anointing age now sure it came from his
[1:07:53] message
[1:07:55] right came from that four star but he
[1:07:57] was already gone he wasn't there to go
[1:08:00] to the people and say no don't do this
[1:08:03] don't do that this is what this is they
[1:08:05] had to go by the holy ghost that was
[1:08:06] inside of them to listen to what it said
[1:08:10] to get them
[1:08:12] through now remember the word thyra
[1:08:15] means dominating
[1:08:16] female or it means also continual
[1:08:19] sacrifice and boy did they not 68
[1:08:22] million of them gave their life the
[1:08:24] messenger was Columba he lived from 521
[1:08:27] to 597 he was born in Donal Ireland see
[1:08:30] he he died in 597 the age started
[1:08:33] 606 so he was already gone before the
[1:08:36] church age started but his message was
[1:08:38] so
[1:08:39] powerful God anointed that man so
[1:08:43] powerful till he wasn't in taping book
[1:08:45] for him like we
[1:08:47] got it was Word of
[1:08:49] Mouth the ministers or the people that
[1:08:51] were in the uh the abies they call them
[1:08:53] then the churches and and the areas they
[1:08:56] had to
[1:08:57] listen and if you weren't
[1:09:00] there you missed
[1:09:02] it all right let's read this real quick
[1:09:04] let's look at this just for a second
[1:09:06] until the angel of the church in thra
[1:09:08] write these things sayith the Son of God
[1:09:09] who ha his eyes like into flames of fire
[1:09:12] and his feet are like fine brass in
[1:09:14] other words God's going to pass judgment
[1:09:16] on this church
[1:09:19] age okay he's not going to forget what
[1:09:21] they
[1:09:22] did look I Know Thy works there's the
[1:09:25] first one and charity and service and
[1:09:29] faith and thy
[1:09:30] patience and thy works all right he said
[1:09:33] that's number two now watch and the last
[1:09:36] be more than the first notwithstanding I
[1:09:39] have a few things against thee because
[1:09:40] thou Hast sufferest that woman Jezebel
[1:09:43] which calleth herself a prophetess to
[1:09:45] teach and seduce my servants my
[1:09:51] servants Satan got into the church with
[1:09:53] this Jezebel Doctrine
[1:09:59] did you see
[1:10:01] that seduce my
[1:10:04] servants and to to commit fornication
[1:10:06] and to eat things sacrificed unto idols
[1:10:09] and I gave her space to repent thank God
[1:10:11] he always gives them a space to repent
[1:10:13] and I gave her her her her the church a
[1:10:16] space to repent of her fornication and
[1:10:18] she repented not you're not going to get
[1:10:20] the Catholics to repent for what they
[1:10:23] did they have a just ification for what
[1:10:26] they did behold I will cast her into a
[1:10:29] bed and then that commit adultery with
[1:10:32] her into Great Tribulation except they
[1:10:34] repent there he is again except they
[1:10:38] repent now he said Works twice all right
[1:10:42] and I will kill her children with
[1:10:46] death I will kill her children he didn't
[1:10:48] say I'll kill her with a sword I'll kill
[1:10:50] her with a gun I'll kill her with a
[1:10:53] knife cuz that would be what you would
[1:10:55] you would think that's what God said he
[1:10:56] said no I'm going to kill them with
[1:10:58] death amen we'll see what brother rown
[1:11:01] says about that we'll talk about this
[1:11:02] afternoon and all the churches see he's
[1:11:05] very he all the churches shall know that
[1:11:08] I am he which serth the Reigns and
[1:11:09] hearts and I will give unto everyone of
[1:11:11] you according to that's number three
[1:11:13] your
[1:11:15] works but unto you I say and unto the
[1:11:17] rest of thyra as many as have not this
[1:11:20] Doctrine and which have not known the
[1:11:22] depths of Satan as they speak I will put
[1:11:24] upon you none other burden so in other
[1:11:26] words they don't have to know what the
[1:11:28] seals
[1:11:30] are they don't have to know about Daniel
[1:11:33] 7 weeks they don't have to know about
[1:11:35] the Statue of perfect
[1:11:37] man they just
[1:11:40] survived Jesus Christ was their savior
[1:11:42] yes and that was it but he said I'll put
[1:11:46] no more on you cu the burden already is
[1:11:48] on you you're going to
[1:11:52] die but that which you have already
[1:11:55] ready hold fast till I
[1:11:58] come now watch this verse
[1:12:01] 26 it was your Works your Works your
[1:12:06] works three times now watch and he that
[1:12:09] overcometh and keepeth my
[1:12:12] Works
[1:12:14] whoa you don't overcome by your
[1:12:18] works you overcome by his Works
[1:12:21] absolutely keepeth my works until the
[1:12:24] end to him will I give power over the
[1:12:28] Nations and he shall rule them with a
[1:12:30] rod of iron as the vessel of a Potter
[1:12:32] shall they be broken to Shivers even as
[1:12:34] I have received of my father and I will
[1:12:37] give him the Morning Star we'll talk
[1:12:39] about that later
[1:12:40] on he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:12:43] the spirit saith to the churches so the
[1:12:46] ox age is an age of works and that's
[1:12:48] what we'll get this is the point real
[1:12:49] quick James 2:1 17 even so faith if it
[1:12:54] hath not works is
[1:12:56] Dead all
[1:12:57] right being
[1:13:00] alone all right cuz brother Randon
[1:13:03] preached works his faith
[1:13:07] expressed all right watch now remember
[1:13:10] he said your Works your Works your Works
[1:13:12] my
[1:13:13] Works everybody with me just for a few
[1:13:15] minutes check
[1:13:16] yourself even so faith if it ha not
[1:13:19] works is dead being alone there is no
[1:13:22] way you can be a born again Christian
[1:13:24] and not have work
[1:13:28] works but you can have works and not be
[1:13:31] born
[1:13:33] again you watch out for people that work
[1:13:35] work work work work work they always
[1:13:37] want to work they always want to work
[1:13:38] they always want to work you better be
[1:13:41] ly of that person because they're
[1:13:42] wanting to work their self into heaven
[1:13:44] not get born again and do the works
[1:13:47] everybody with me I've seen it several
[1:13:50] times yeah a man may say thou Hast faith
[1:13:53] and I have works
[1:13:55] show me thy faith without thy works and
[1:13:57] I'll show thee my faith by my
[1:14:00] works for as the body without the spirit
[1:14:03] is dead so faith without works is dead
[1:14:07] also yes sir all
[1:14:10] right this great
[1:14:12] faith there's got to be Works follow
[1:14:15] it but you can have all kind of works
[1:14:17] and be dead as a doornail that's why he
[1:14:20] said I'll kill them with death
[1:14:25] I'm going to kill them with the very
[1:14:27] thing that they die I'll get to it this
[1:14:30] afternoon it's really interesting what
[1:14:32] brother M says about that and at TH time
[1:14:35] Church age here again we find the same
[1:14:37] introduction remark I Know Thy works the
[1:14:40] Son of God himself said believe me for
[1:14:42] the very work sake even Jesus said look
[1:14:44] if you can't believe me believe me for
[1:14:46] the works but remember when they believe
[1:14:48] then they put all the emphasis on the
[1:14:49] works when he began to say I am my
[1:14:51] father a one or he began to say I am God
[1:14:55] they couldn't take it but they loved his
[1:14:58] Works healing signs and wonders that's
[1:15:01] what this this this whole this
[1:15:03] everything's going to be tied to signs
[1:15:05] and wonders but it is the right one
[1:15:08] there's two Spirits working
[1:15:09] remember believe me for the very work
[1:15:12] sake he put an emphasis on his own
[1:15:15] works not yours on his own Works my
[1:15:19] Works while on Earth The Works that he
[1:15:22] did were ordained of God to inspire
[1:15:25] faith in
[1:15:26] him it was a great part of his
[1:15:29] ministry his holy spirit in the Apostle
[1:15:32] Paul said for we are his workmanship
[1:15:34] work workmanship we
[1:15:37] work created in Christ Jesus unto good
[1:15:40] works which God hath ordained that we
[1:15:43] should walk in them Ephesians 2:10 said
[1:15:47] that's Ephesians 2:10 these Works were
[1:15:48] to inspire faith in him as they would
[1:15:50] show forth that relationship to him that
[1:15:52] Paul described as created in him this is
[1:15:55] Brother Brown on the tharan church age
[1:15:58] now works will never take the place of
[1:15:59] Faith Watch Works will never take the
[1:16:05] place all right it'll never take the
[1:16:09] place of faith in God for our
[1:16:12] Salvation all
[1:16:14] right
[1:16:16] but works will show forth our faith
[1:16:19] already placed in
[1:16:21] him good works won't save you
[1:16:25] but they will come forth out of a saved
[1:16:27] life hallelujah praise Goden it'll come
[1:16:31] forth just as the fruit if you if you
[1:16:34] plant an orange tree oranges are going
[1:16:36] to come out on that
[1:16:40] limb good works won't save you but they
[1:16:42] will come forth out of a saved life as
[1:16:44] fruit unto the Lord I believe in good
[1:16:47] works even if a man is not saved he
[1:16:50] ought to do good works and do the best
[1:16:51] he can hello
[1:16:55] but you know what they
[1:16:57] don't cuz the world took over
[1:17:00] and what is it I I mean me it's a
[1:17:03] selfish world now selfie world
[1:17:07] now what is horrible in the sight of God
[1:17:10] now watch is for men to do evil works
[1:17:12] and then say they were doing the will of
[1:17:14] God that's what God can't
[1:17:17] stand in this verse he is commending his
[1:17:20] children because they were living
[1:17:22] changed lives their Works
[1:17:26] testified to a new spirit within yes sir
[1:17:31] men saw their good works and glorified
[1:17:33] God yes sir if you are a Christian you
[1:17:36] are going to do what is
[1:17:38] right your Works will
[1:17:41] show that your heart is right right and
[1:17:45] if it won't be something that you put on
[1:17:47] for you will do his will when no one but
[1:17:49] God sees whoa whoa I should have
[1:17:53] underlined that when and made it
[1:17:57] it won't be something that you put on
[1:17:58] for you will do his will when no one but
[1:18:01] God sees you and you will do his will
[1:18:05] even what if it cost you your
[1:18:08] life are you willing to do that are you
[1:18:11] willing to take a bullet for
[1:18:14] God so brother Brian preached works is
[1:18:18] Faith expressed amen I know th works and
[1:18:21] the last to be more than the first
[1:18:23] brother Bri said look this is s this is
[1:18:25] certainly remarkable as the darkness of
[1:18:27] the age increased as the honor role of
[1:18:30] the martyrs grew lengthier day by day
[1:18:32] they worked all the harder now here's a
[1:18:35] rebuke to us our problem in leosia is we
[1:18:39] get the clamps put on us we go
[1:18:42] backwards oh I'm going to read it don't
[1:18:44] you think I already know He already said
[1:18:45] that in our
[1:18:47] age we cow down their age they knew they
[1:18:51] were being put to the lines they knew
[1:18:53] that what was going on they were going
[1:18:54] to to die for and brother R said they
[1:18:56] worked harder and
[1:18:58] harder they served all the more and
[1:19:00] their faith increased how tragic it was
[1:19:04] in that Ephesian age where love
[1:19:07] waned and truly nothing is said of the
[1:19:09] increased labor of love in the other
[1:19:11] ages but in this age in the darkest of
[1:19:13] all ages they served him even more what
[1:19:17] a lesson that is there's no ceasing of
[1:19:19] this gracious service of Love unto the
[1:19:22] Lord but rather an increase of it yes
[1:19:25] that is the
[1:19:26] secret let the enemy attempt to thwart
[1:19:29] our service to the Lord our reply is I
[1:19:32] ain't going to church they don't like me
[1:19:34] no
[1:19:35] more I just don't go oh Lord I got to
[1:19:41] sit beside
[1:19:43] somebody I got to listen to that baby
[1:19:45] cry I I I got this little ache in my
[1:19:49] leg oh my car needs working on
[1:19:54] I really don't like that guy in the pull
[1:19:57] pit let the enemy attempt to thwart our
[1:20:00] service to the Lord our reply is
[1:20:02] increased service yes sir we can sit
[1:20:06] here me and you were talking about
[1:20:07] something the other day you can sit
[1:20:08] stand here and you can tell people if
[1:20:11] you're having trouble don't stay out of
[1:20:14] church you do not listen to what we
[1:20:19] say now is that true that's true we all
[1:20:23] go
[1:20:25] these people in this church age said
[1:20:27] what Bring it
[1:20:28] on Bring it on my faith will be
[1:20:31] increased by what I do by what I
[1:20:35] do step out for
[1:20:38] God and he'll be there for you he was
[1:20:40] with them yes I don't say this is thus
[1:20:44] sayith the Lord but I promise you if if
[1:20:46] the first martyr we're going to talk
[1:20:48] about it today this afternoon the first
[1:20:50] Marty was Steven the Bible said he fell
[1:20:53] asleep come on that's right these people
[1:20:55] fell
[1:20:56] asleep I don't believe they felt a line
[1:20:59] pulling their guts out I believe God
[1:21:01] give them an anastesia sir it's called
[1:21:03] the Holy Ghost sir to get through that
[1:21:07] age and to look over and and and and see

[1:21:16] spirit coming off those people till the
[1:21:19] Romans get converted praise God they'll
[1:21:21] be in heaven
[1:21:26] yes what a greater thing sure we all
[1:21:29] want our kids to come to church we all
[1:21:31] want our kids to be born again but what
