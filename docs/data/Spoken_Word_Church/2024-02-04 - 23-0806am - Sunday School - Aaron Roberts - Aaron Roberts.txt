========================================

in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen so um I ain't got nothing for y'all to look at um I'm y'all y'all pray for me I'm going get better at technology I'm not technologically advanced like the rest of them but uh uh we're going we're going to get all the bugs worked out one of these days so uh this morning I I want to uh look at a little thought here and uh I want to read Romans 1: 16 and 17 and then Matthew 15 and Romans 116:17 very familiar scripture says for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God un salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek he said for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith and Matthew chap 15 beginning at verse 1 says then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem saying why do thy disciples transgress the TR the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread but he answered and said unto them why do ye also transgress the Commandment of God by your tradition for God commanded saying honor thy father and mother and he he that curseth father or mother let him die the death but ye say whosoever shall say to his father and or his mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me and honor not his father or his mother he shall be free thus have ye made the Commandment of God of none effect by your tradition he HP Hypocrites well did Isaiah prophesy of you saying this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men and that's one thing I want to look at uh the doctrines because we have you can have the doctrines or is it following the commands ments of men and um one of the things I was I was looking at some things and then I was thinking about was in Bible Study last night and you know you can have the word and one of the questions was asked about uh Revelation said can you get a revelation without being born again well I've always said when God begins to deal with you justification is a revelation when it brings you to the place of you understand because you've got to see that you're Justified you've got to come to a place to realize that you're lost and you need a savior amen that's a revelation God shows you who you are because when you realize I'm in this place and there's a Chasm between me and God and there's only one that's going to bridge that Chasm and that's Jesus Christ that's righten and he's offering you the gift a free gift of salvation for you to come into fellowship with him he wants to bring you into this place when you see that that's the Revelation and as brother Wade was speaking you know when you see that the Revelation when God begins to deal with you that the that Revelation then you can't stay in the same place that you were before because that Revelation is to bring you to a closer step so when you come into justification then the Lord begins when you step into that what it in in Acts two when he when he says to repent and be baptized what do what does repent mean it means to turn from your old ways so when you turn from the old your old ways now that doesn't that doesn't mean that you're not going to fall that doesn't mean you're not going to fail that doesn't mean you're not going to have problems but you know what you make a conscious effort to turn away from the old things you you know when you get to that place the Lord has to do a work in your life but there's something that we do you know you can't be around the same people that you were around before for you have to make a conscious effort to change who you are you know you know one of my one of my favorite loves and and one of the things that I I was absorbed with I mean absolutely absorbed with was country music asked Janine asked Richard I was I was I mean you you asked me I I knew all about it I know I know songwriters I know I know singers anybody that wanted different Awards over the years I knew them I knew all kinds of people I was like a walking encyclopedia I just absorbed everything it because it was just something I loved I just I played it all the time but you know when when the Lord began to deal with me and the Lord saved me you know I had to I had to turn all that away right and you know what when when I give my heart to the Lord you know what the love of country music didn't leave you know what it took it took some s ification to get there but you know it was it was a process but you know what I sold all my CDs I got rid of all my stuff all because I had to make a conscious effort to stay away from that and so when you get to that point you've got to set all that aside yes and so then you start trying to make that conscious effort but you know the desire had to leave and it's just like smoking and you know those different things you've got to try to put that away amen I'm going to step away from that but you know you got but the Lord has to do the sanctification that's right and just like the sister that brother Brenham was talking about you know you can't go and and witness to those people as she did in the dance hall and well I'm so I'm I'm so delivered from that well come to find out she realized she wasn't delivered from that because when she got back into that atmosphere it drew her right back back in and she was right back out on the dance floor and so it's the same way when you when you receive that revelation God is bringing you to a a closer walk but you know we've got to put some effort into it ourselves and that doesn't mean when you when you fall and when you fail you know what the grace of God is still there to cover you and you know what you just pick up and you just keep going right you know and so you just you just keep going forward like I I I fall I fa but you know what I if I can't look at myself you can't look at yourself because you know what we can confess our faults and he is faithful and just to forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness is what the scripture tells us then you know what we just go before the Lord and you know I you know what I'm not I can't do this but you know I'm going to put some effort into it amen I'm going I'm going to pray yes and you know what and everything's going to get in your way and I'm going to pray and I'm going to read my Bible sir but you know what you've got you've got to press into that sir and you know what the devil's going to be there right right beside you right in front of you he's going to hinder you all the way but you know what you just got to keep fighting him you got to keep pressing that battle and you know as you stay in the word through the word comes sanctification because as you feed on the word the Holy Ghost is and and see that's another Revel that comes because he begins to reveal to you you'll start to see the unclean Spirit go out that's right you'll start to see those things that you battled that you know I can't overcome these things and brother Donnie would tell you we sat down at the shop years ago and he was and you know he kept telling me I can't give up cigarettes but you know I told him I said I told him EX exactly what he needed to do that's right just keep on going right amen I said when you get Ser when you get down to business with God God will get down to business with you amen that's right and when you get to that place where you like you said when you get tired of being sick and tired and you want to get rid of that thing and you get before God and you get B get serious with God God will come on the scene but sometimes we're just kind of like this scripture here and you know the one of the reasons why I I want to read this scripture is because you know Jesus said they they took the doctrines and they made the they made they taught the for the doctrines the Commandments of men and you know he was talking about by by your Traditions you've made the word of God of none effect and one of the one of the definitions of tradition is an is an ordinance it's it's like a law but one of the definitions that I found I thought was really interesting it means giving up giving over the act of giving up as in the surrender of cities yes and I thought that was really interesting when I was reading that what caught my attention is when you look at that when when the Lord has brought you to a place and the word has come to you and just like they did those Pharisees and the Sadducees they took the word that they had heard and it was tradition to them it wasn't in the law they had read into that and they had made their own rules their own traditions and because of that they put that on equal billing with the law of Moses and so they equaled these and had the each one had have the same reverence so when they saw the disciples come by and they didn't wash their hands and they didn't wash pots and they didn't do certain things they were highly upset with those disciples and they come to Jesus why do they do that and he was like well why is it that y'all don't follow the word when the when the and because they had got to this place of looking at everything a certain way they had lost the reverence for the for the for the word and many times in our lives we can do the exact same thing in the fact that if we allow it's like well I yes you can overcome but if we allow the devil to put in our mind we can't over over come you can't be healed you can't be delivered you've always battled this and you'll always battle this you know your grandparents had diabetes your parents had diabetes and they say you got diabetes Well you know what the diabetes devil can get off because the word of God says by his stripes we were healed yes sir and so just because it come down through my genealogy the physical genealogy doesn't mean that I'm accepting those rattlesnakes and just because brother bam said you know we all have tempers well you know what hey we we still battling this flesh right but you know what we don't have to battle him forever why because there's Deliverance but by the word by the word that has come we have received Deliverance yes and we just continue to walk in that justification was a revelation sanctification is a revelation the baptism the new birth is a revelation and then we know that coming up through the stature of a perfect man every one of those is a revelation it's a continuation but you know what it's the same Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost starts you on your journey and you start going in every step step of the way it's the Holy Ghost leading you all the way and you just continue but you know we don't have to we don't have to back up for the devil we don't have to accept somebody else's thoughts or ideas about it you know those Pharisees and Sadducees they they had heard for years all those Generations had heard that oral tradition as law and they wouldn't transgress that for nothing but here they are but they had spent more time worried about the the the certain things about tithing all these little mints and cumin and all this other stuff and Jesus said you've turned away from the wayer matters of the scripture right because they're so because they were so interested in certain little things and they didn't understand to see to look at the big picture and they had missed out and they were and they were so tied up with certain things that they missed god brother brandham said that the word was made flesh the Messiah was standing in front of them and they were so wrapped up in their own tradition of things that they were had missed the very God Messiah standing in front of them and standing there speaking to them and they had missed that's who they who they were looking for they had spent all these years looking hey we we know the messiah's coming when the messiah's coming he's going to fulfill the word but he didn't come the way they wanted him to he didn't come the way they expected him to and when he didn't come that way then they were then they they you know they come against him and brother BR said they turned him down they turned it down but when Jesus stood before them and told him said search the scriptures and them you say you have eternal life but they are they that testify of me and here they are standing in front of them and beginning to speak the word and here here they are expressing the word but Jesus brings them back to the UN the true revelation of what the word says not just saying something you know there you know throughout the the years we see a number of people and I thank God for our for our pastor and his ministry all these years but you know there's lots of people that that have heard and just like the Pharisees they've heard a commandment they've heard a tradition and it's like well you know well we all we all come with here with this seed in it and it's like well let's go back to the scripture and let's see what the scripture says yeah that's right and you know and then it's like well you know you talk about Daniel 70 weeks or or different things you know you ask who's who's taught on the stature of a perfect man all these doctrines and it's like well you know we believe them but nobody nobody digs into them and it almost be has become a tradition that people have not looked at the word that nobody's dug into the word but you know we've had a pastor that has really C this message and he has and he has labored in the word and we've had a five-fold Ministry brother Wade brother Bob brother whis man they have labored in the word amen that's right and you we have we have the word and I think about brother Keith you know meeting I don't know when he met brother Dale brother Wade them but you know man I tell you what I I thoroughly have enjoyed I get to I don't know if y'all know this not but brother Keith church is on YouTube you can you can listen to and uh I tell you what if you uh there's a little side note um if if if you if you feel down and you don't think you can uh you need a little pick me up youall listen to the song Services sometimes and uh I you know I think if if I don't stir your soul you spoons fat out of your bowl but you know you see these brothers and you know they have labored in the word amen and you know it was because you know somebody had to set aside their their ideas their tradition whatever they thought right and you know they had to get into the word and dig yes yeah and you know just like when the disciples were there and and they're looking in the word but Peter had a revelation when Jesus stood there and told asked the disciples who do men say that I am I the son of man am well you're one of the prophets you know you're you're one of but who do you say that I am not what every what man says what everybody else says what what's the leading thought of today but who do you say I am and Peter stood there and says Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and he said blessed are you Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood never revealed this to you but my fathers revealed this to you right and he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church he said the Gates of Hell won't Prevail against it Amen brother Brown said it didn't mean that the gates of hell wouldn't come against you with everything that it had that's but the gates of hell can't Prevail over you right the gates of hell all the power in hell can't overcome you you can't be defeated if we stand on the word if there's a place that God has made for us to stand then that's where God has wanted us to be stand on the word because if we stand there then we have a place yes then when when we say well I don't understand something Peter didn't understand right he didn't understand the disciples didn't understand but you know what they knew who he was and and they followed in what he had what he told them and so you know even in all their faults and failures you know what God didn't give Jesus didn't give up on them am they you know what he told him he said I'm going want to go away I'm they said destroy this temple in 3 days and I'll raise it up again you know what Peter didn't agree with that Peter didn't see that but you know what it didn't change it didn't change Jesus's thought on Peter I kept telling him said Peter when you when you get converted when you get over yourself when you get converted when you get over this when when the Holy Ghost comes in and quickens the word that you're holding listen strengthen your brethren amen you know when you think about all the faults and failures that Peter had and all the problems Jesus stand there and told him said Peter he said Satan has desired to sift you like wheat he said but I've prayed for you he had somebody that was interceding on his behalf right and let me tell you something we have a great high priest this morning and you know what he desires the best for each one of us and wherever you are this morning whatever your need is this morning he's here to meet it and so whatever you have need of you don't have to worry about the things that have come in the past you know what because the sea of forgetfulness is there The Depths to be all of your sin is to be put in the depths of the sea as as Paul said he said putting those things that are behind me he said I press toward the mark of the High Calling I'm putting all these things behind me because you know if if I just let all the things that I've seen all the things in my peripheral you know I you you won't get anywhere that's right and that's what the devil he brings all these things before you he wants you to keep our eye but there's one thing we do we keep our Eye On Christ amen we keep our eye where he said for us to go he's made that promise that I'm not looking at what what do report say it's like our doctor says this but I got a doctor's report over here from the great physician it's like well which one am I going to look at well you know what as long as long as you got breath in your body and you and you're still moving you know then you know what I'm still looking at it by Stripes we're healed yes sir amen amen nothing trumps that that's when when the the harder the battle the the the more the Devil Comes against you then you know what it's the greater the victory when you see your your love lost your lost loved ones when your when your children and your are doing all kinds of things and you look and think well how's this how's this going to work out well you know what I ain't trying to figure out how it's gonna work out right that's right God didn't ask me if if to figure it out he said Do you believe right then that's that's all I can do I can put it in God's hands because he's the one that'll take care of the problems he's the one that'll solve it it's one because I you know I always think about in in the message letting off the pressure that sister that had the grown children and brother BR was talking about you know she's like 60 years old she looks 30 and she said well brother brand when I I when I was young I give my heart to the Lord and said you know he said cast all your cares upon Him and he said that's what I done I cast all my cares on him and we'll have the musicians come on this morning we're getting ready to finish but he said I cast all my cares on him because I realized that he he said he would take care of my problems he would take care of me and you know what I cast them all on him because you know what if he can't carry them I know I can't carry him amen and you know she had such peace she had let off all that pressure and you know what it didn't she wasn't worried about all these things she didn't carry all that stress and all why and it showed on her countenance that she had cast her cares upon Him and it's the best place God wants us wants to carry your burdens He said Come All Ye that labor and are heavy laden yes and he said I'll give you rest and you know many times we we want to just like the little story I'm I'm going to finish here but it's like the little story about the about the little boy that had the toy that brought it to his dad he wanted it him to fix it and he kept wondering why he couldn't why his dad wouldn't fix it and he's like son he as long as you're holding on to it I can't fix it but he said you've got to turn it over to me he said when you let go of it he said then I can fix it and many times in our lives we think we've turned things over to the Lord and really when we take a full account when we really sit down and pray about things sometimes we realize you know we think we turn over the Lord but we keep muddling in it and we kept messing with it and you know what we turn it over to the Lord and say thank you Lord it I I lay it in your hands within your I'm not I'm not digging in it anymore trying to figure out things I'm free of that because then then I don't have to try to try to figure it out or or worry or fret or anything about it because it's in his hands amen God bless you this morning for
