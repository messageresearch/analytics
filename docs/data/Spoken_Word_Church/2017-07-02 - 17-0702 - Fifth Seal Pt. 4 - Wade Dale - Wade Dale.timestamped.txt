[0:00] and up what prices up well the wind is
[0:07] not here either
[0:07] there is no there there visiting his
[0:09] father well it was Kim
[0:11] oh they got after Canada I got there
[0:14] yesterday by Revelation chapter 6 verse
[0:20] 9 we're on the big deal and I hope you
[0:24] finish early
[0:25] I just said I didn't bring my bottle
[0:29] immediately okay that's all right that's
[0:31] why we got it right so when you get over
[0:33] the fifth seal I saw under the altar the
[0:35] souls of them that were slain for the
[0:36] words on testimony 1910-11 stepfather
[0:39] okay it does all this work okay
[0:46] so rho v feel now last time we when we
[0:50] ended we let will come up last night and
[0:55] bob study there's a purpose for
[0:58] everything that we do this person
[0:59] several things I hear that the purpose
[1:01] for him to write it in the word my
[1:03] contention is the same way with the
[1:05] property guy brother ground preached it
[1:06] then it's open for us to understand and
[1:10] be able to preach there's not a mystery
[1:13] I thought he would come revelation ten
[1:15] seven says in the days of or settle name
[1:18] it when the mystery is to be revealed so
[1:21] the mystery should be revealed on the
[1:23] voice of the seventh angel he spoke it
[1:25] and then guess what happened we take
[1:28] that and deliver it to the people all
[1:30] right and then in turns you have to your
[1:32] filter of the Holy Ghost to make sure
[1:36] that we're telling you the right thing
[1:37] make sure that it's exactly what the
[1:39] Prophet said and like I said before like
[1:44] last Sunday there is doing the brand
[1:47] quotes the will do this is probably one
[1:51] of the churches do Brent's the most
[1:53] quotes to the table but we have to and
[1:57] I'm not saying waste your time but do we
[1:59] have to make sure that brother Brown
[2:02] said no that's my job didn't study to
[2:06] make sure he said my brother L said he
[2:08] said
[2:08] try to tear down what I'm just preach so
[2:11] if he tries to break me down and if he
[2:13] can't break it down do my own brand
[2:16] bring you to the people if he is for the
[2:18] profit can't bring it down after bottle
[2:20] can't bring it down then it must be part
[2:23] of what the Bible is and what the
[2:24] Prophet said the brand preach to us you
[2:29] don't have to say brother I'm said right
[2:31] okay you can and it is your own
[2:34] revelation because if we just keep
[2:35] quoting what he said then you know 50
[2:38] years more from now most of us in this
[2:41] room will be here right that's what
[2:44] somebody else saw somebody else here but
[2:46] if you can take it when I study I know
[2:50] before they were 30 we already know some
[2:52] of those quotes in our mind we don't
[2:53] have to go look them up okay it's like
[2:56] I've always did
[2:57] hardly anybody know what's in it hardly
[3:01] in it because of this I guess hardly
[3:02] anybody in this message had to be added
[3:05] to the list they just it cemented and we
[3:09] go to church and it's quotes and we
[3:11] believe program with the Prophet and
[3:12] hair and dress and clothes and yeah but
[3:14] me and brother Joe Kennedy was talking
[3:16] about he hurt somebody Norton in Indiana
[3:20] so my going he was a good Peter wolf he
[3:22] said hello he might be a good elementary
[3:25] school teacher our kindergarten school
[3:27] teacher buddy preached no doctrine and
[3:29] he did not use one quote when you talk
[3:31] about living a good life and doing this
[3:32] and doing that the dude with the dome
[3:34] and all right that's not even teaching
[3:38] to me yeah the bottom program strategic
[3:41] places you in the body even Paul in the
[3:44] book of Ephesians he knew he could talk
[3:46] to those Ephesians different than he
[3:47] could the crankin right why because he
[3:50] come to a place that he knew what God
[3:52] said out of the Old Testament and he
[3:55] took three his filter and give it to the
[3:57] agents up
[3:58] the day he laid a mistake in front of
[4:00] them without when he went to the correct
[4:01] in here some mashed potatoes and green
[4:04] beans and probably that mash them up a
[4:06] little bit you know he gives everything
[4:07] yeah in other words what he didn't want
[4:10] to work down but he just didn't choke
[4:12] them with it either he gave to them as
[4:14] they needed it but now you've got to
[4:17] remember one thing I think about this
[4:19] other day the properties I've told us
[4:22] that the congregation is what dictates
[4:24] what you preach so somebody's got to be
[4:27] maybe there's nobody in that church that
[4:30] wants a choir read that let's just you
[4:33] know don't name it let's just say they
[4:35] or know what to steal it's been such a
[4:37] measuring the biosuit well maybe that's
[4:40] why I warned up it stimulates my not
[4:46] stimulate my thigh man it stimulating my
[4:48] vision one place this man you know or
[4:51] know these things here and I say what we
[4:54] either breath same way with all of us we
[4:56] have come to a place that we have a
[4:58] spiritual appetite that surely can I
[5:01] live in Green Bay
[5:03] I love magical have some an idea for a
[5:05] brain look even green beans for
[5:08] Mullingar which inaudible have them and
[5:10] we'll help remember to make do it again
[5:12] right some will have that go in it I
[5:16] ain't don't have this painting and
[5:18] potatoes what is that that is Tommy if I
[5:25] say been converted that to me to
[5:26] sometimes might be but how will need to
[5:29] go with it you know
[5:30] thanks man shut your stop it
[5:35] forever son right
[5:37] you want something you know you want the
[5:41] reason say hit is when gone broke this
[5:44] field to the profit watch what happened
[5:47] he he quoted many kind of sold under the
[5:50] altar and you'll read the fifth seal and
[5:54] then all the other sealed
[5:55] he tells us he said now I know what this
[5:58] seal was he said my thought was totally
[6:01] different than that see he come to the
[6:04] thinking when he heard read that took
[6:07] his old nose and he pries sold under the
[6:09] altar
[6:10] which was the ones in the sixth
[6:12] dimension that he saw in 1960 well this
[6:14] is not conceited very and they going to
[6:17] reveal to him that look he's reading
[6:20] they cried how long how long dispels
[6:23] judge and avenge our blood and out that
[6:25] struck brother branham he didn't have to
[6:28] have a quote his Holy Ghost said that
[6:33] can't be a born-again believer listen I
[6:38] don't believe that
[6:38] angel sit there and verbatim told him
[6:41] everything that we unseal he gave you a
[6:44] little point he gave him a little point
[6:47] he gave a little point and run around by
[6:49] because it was his revelation remember
[6:52] that angel that was liberal around never
[6:55] did give him a revelation now we know
[6:58] that Christ came to do this we know that
[7:00] but still brother on how to get it right
[7:03] through his filter they said hey that's
[7:08] not us I know nothing to do with a bribe
[7:10] because avenge our blood will call out
[7:14] vengeance when we call mercy Jesus did
[7:16] call out vengeance and call mercy right
[7:18] so further I said okay now the other
[7:20] lights to this a little bit more then we
[7:23] see that that's the fifth seal Jew all
[7:26] Jewish nothing to do with jihad or any
[7:31] other nation because honestly he came to
[7:35] the Jews they were jacking him they
[7:36] turned him down but he said I'll not
[7:37] forget it so that in other words he's
[7:39] got to go back and get him and I'm gonna
[7:43] say that and this is where most said he
[7:45] caused them to not know any further God
[7:50] caused them not to go any further
[7:53] yeah played you like you then he had you
[7:57] know mother because that's just
[7:59] expression yeah that they just got to me
[8:02] that's why did did not bring a higher
[8:04] form of justification not just that he
[8:07] chopped off their past and he never saw
[8:10] these people sin if he ever saw that
[8:13] fish-filled youth end he could give me
[8:15] I can do it so I said this is
[8:20] justification time - this is the higher
[8:22] level of justification did they never
[8:24] did that in here not okay
[8:28] come you have to judge them if you did
[8:30] but he's not need to look and white
[8:32] robes were given unto every every one of
[8:35] them and it was said unto them that they
[8:38] should rest for a little season until
[8:40] their fellow-servants I'll do it
[8:43] that should be killed as they were
[8:45] should be fulfilled so you fit seal is
[8:54] coming out of the listen to me is coming
[8:56] because remember they're given white
[8:58] rope so we're not given what route we're
[9:05] given what Road here when we receive the
[9:08] baptism of those that is our white rope
[9:10] so we receive it here
[9:13] they've received it after they had now
[9:15] that's not true to a Gentile except for
[9:18] the 50 of you I'm sorry the Buddhist
[9:22] version and the ones given eternal
[9:25] life's cup water my name they'll be
[9:27] given my rope echovox on judgement these
[9:30] don't go to watch on judgment they're
[9:34] given a white robe right here during
[9:36] this time so see that's a whole nother
[9:40] situation but it says but it's the
[9:43] justness of God to be just he's gotta be
[9:46] a judge and he actually judged himself I
[9:50] called that
[9:52] don't you think obvious hurts what a man
[9:55] they did I all that and I have a
[9:58] problems left more foundational world
[10:00] world
[10:01] he called it you know but to but to have
[10:04] continuity to his plan like I said last
[10:06] night I'll keep saying over and over
[10:08] again there's no other way we can
[10:10] understand
[10:10] except by this Bob no way I mean sure
[10:15] man's going to run their hair the
[10:18] ologist have a good idea over here isn't
[10:20] gonna but right there everything happens
[10:22] in that we're going to show me who does
[10:24] it and we and you know what he didn't
[10:28] write it he did write it to hide it from
[10:30] the Bible proof but not uh that would be
[10:34] able to learn it because oh well he said
[10:36] lobby agent everybody walk you know
[10:38] period well one just up
[10:41] he can't just you then we can't judge
[10:45] you now he can judge you by everything
[10:48] he wrote now he can judge you but all
[10:50] he's got to do is go let go okay this
[10:55] this this is this is the part you missed
[10:58] I don't have to in other words like
[11:02] saying when we get to the washroom
[11:03] gentlemen we're not going to be lawyers
[11:09] they have to go back in and go back in
[11:12] the bathroom and go this way right what
[11:17] I will have to let those oh no will know
[11:22] instantly and that person I believe will
[11:24] know - nothing three terms on them right
[11:31] you say well how long will it take you
[11:33] know here we go again Louis take out
[11:35] that technicality how long's it going to
[11:37] take that you in here will buy the able
[11:38] to live right there if they just let
[11:42] that walk through and do anything to be
[11:44] over will hired us where you darling you
[11:46] I know what the matter but then people
[11:48] blast on many times if you talk about
[11:50] your lives and talk about what a meaning
[11:52] I can run through the laser things in my
[11:55] life in a minute you're probably like it
[11:58] real back and so now when they come up
[12:02] out of that ground they stand before
[12:04] Judge know if you think everything's
[12:05] gonna be opened differently
[12:07] actly so what I'm saying we're not to
[12:10] have to eternal have to preach to live
[12:13] another word
[12:14] they got briefed to over here here you
[12:16] don't have to preach to a level that yes
[12:18] that does one like resurrected once you
[12:20] die whatever way the three lanes that's
[12:23] a way of offering if you die on you're
[12:25] not a Christian then you know rebuilt if
[12:28] you die you're with Christians and you
[12:30] know what's going to happen that's what
[12:32] I like about the Word of God tells us
[12:33] all these things but if I see that this
[12:36] is not just a justification just just
[12:38] didn't chop off their past census this
[12:41] eradicated ever sin that they have a
[12:43] committed it had to to thinking what
[12:46] wrote that the hurry
[12:47] they got to be clean in here lives and
[12:50] his judgment says I did this to get run
[12:58] I did this to get u-turn looking at us
[13:04] to get us he blinded their eyes so
[13:07] therefore I don't have a problem with
[13:11] them get some I shouldn't know much
[13:12] everything problems done but yes there's
[13:15] no problem with white robes were given
[13:17] unto them we in there while I work Jews
[13:20] they were teach kids mongers you
[13:22] know they were thieves
[13:26] that's not something good yes
[13:29] why Rome's given they're one of them
[13:31] this then that did that fifth
[13:33] field you don't be giving her life and I
[13:35] have no say-so to that okay but I can
[13:38] glean out of that that not only were
[13:42] they justified they didn't do God I bit
[13:47] into never brother Bible will bring it
[13:49] out next Sunday we're brother and sister
[13:54] is a higher form of justification as the
[13:56] harmfulness a magician if that that you
[13:59] did it we've covered this before you did
[14:01] it you did it you know you did I wish
[14:07] not going to raise my mind things I do
[14:09] but when I became justifying though
[14:11] glory off that off and mice labels as
[14:14] clean as this right here right of my
[14:17] past then right but now three weeks
[14:22] later I was still doing the same thing
[14:25] that I was doing see this is all white
[14:27] now this is still goes back to smutty
[14:29] black because my soul your black hello
[14:33] you're justified it only jumped off you
[14:36] pass in here if you know if you if you
[14:40] live years without repenting or without
[14:44] anything changing you're going to help
[14:47] look Judas was trained to fight anyone
[14:52] else and he comes through justification
[14:55] right so that justification chopped off
[14:59] the past in but now the next thing other
[15:02] have said is this as if you never done
[15:05] it and then the third one if the real
[15:10] you didn't I just want I'm trying to get
[15:13] us to see that Genesis 1.6 money God
[15:16] burns out all nature is you out that
[15:18] Inge is one point six moves in and you
[15:20] become a new creature a new creation
[15:22] you're tied to the turtles you're just
[15:24] as eternal as audience there's no man
[15:26] confusion no land killing why you had
[15:31] all that burn out not just burn out and
[15:34] tomorrow I got I'm telling you folks if
[15:38] we're still two plays that we're fine of
[15:41] alcohol and drugs and cousin and running
[15:45] around and and all that stuff we're
[15:47] fighting it then you just have the case
[15:49] justification that's all you're gone
[15:51] then you know you think about it and I'm
[15:54] you're many people in the evenin its
[15:56] message well why have to hold those
[15:59] because I don't smoke no more I don't
[16:01] smoke them off the fire at the hodo
[16:02] that's not true could be true sorry
[16:05] could be true but don't beat on that
[16:06] could be true but brother Ram says
[16:11] justification he said the sins gone from
[16:14] your past
[16:15] the desire is still there you're still
[16:18] going to do it Michael Anthony she can't
[16:21] get hold of bill woman over your pants
[16:23] well if you are passing you know
[16:26] electors okay
[16:30] you still coming you got hotel but why
[16:35] don't we dealing with these things now
[16:36] because people are not taught they just
[16:39] think they come in here and sit down and
[16:41] give it just feeling anywhere I'm not
[16:42] coming here anywhere now a good feeling
[16:44] got to the profit
[16:46] I've done a mystery that you don't know
[16:47] I don't something you don't have or I
[16:50] have something you don't know and they
[16:52] said there and that's why you see now
[16:56] what this is manifest in town so even
[16:59] the preachers with your number one the
[17:02] preachers never got the Holy Ghost good
[17:04] if you've got to hold goes you'll never
[17:06] leave this man so here we go again that
[17:10] free trader Holy Ghost he lead to
[17:12] message and denies it sure now he might
[17:14] be interested illusion let me back up
[17:15] but if he continues all in that
[17:17] direction you know one thing for sure
[17:20] God didn't burn that old nature of them
[17:22] yet that own danger talk about death and
[17:24] said I got something now they didn't
[17:25] probably got that's Adele I got
[17:27] something Barry thought all right and I
[17:30] got some very Gaga at the deli that
[17:36] dented 1.6 money I eat we're not saying
[17:41] if we see that that Genesis 1.6 man
[17:44] there never was up but our soul has done
[17:51] it why not
[17:54] the Holy Ghost and buyer will read some
[17:57] today I think maybe we'll get it that
[17:59] fire burns got out and I just burned out
[18:02] what happened when it heard it out then
[18:05] we spirit goes out of a man Walton drop
[18:07] ways and see red last night what comes
[18:09] back let it work but what if you took
[18:11] that void and brought the jinns is 1.6
[18:15] man quit me in a minute you're done
[18:19] you're done
[18:20] yes
[18:27] that's eternal life which bobbling you
[18:31] burp you received you guys say it that
[18:33] way the Genesis 1:26 never had a new
[18:35] birth okay
[18:37] the Genesis 1:26 is not a new birth
[18:42] the judge is 126 coming in perfect
[18:45] insulting you is the new birth
[18:48] Johnson is one which is not a bucket nut
[18:51] that you don't have the perfect justice
[18:52] is 1.6 men all the time
[18:54] okay know what it does you know till the
[19:01] jumps is 1.6 man is about pizza mother
[19:03] holds up besides all the other thing to
[19:07] this but if the new birth it be if the
[19:11] effects of the new birth because the new
[19:13] birth is what you weren't birth right
[19:15] the first time so the judge is 1.6 men
[19:18] makes you reborn are as halted
[19:20] regenerated the genetics of Genesis 1:26
[19:23] man is not in me and my soul never again
[19:28] will a bit of my natural earthly time
[19:32] you'll still have a part of your nature
[19:34] right okay
[19:37] when I get to heaven you're not over
[19:38] when I get must a heaven when I get to
[19:40] the future home y'all don't have to find
[19:43] me hidden under a rock we talking like
[19:46] citizens barber are are are not talking
[19:52] like this apart but you know what though
[19:55] that's refrain characteristic and are
[19:56] likely so it's okay exactly right right
[19:58] but you might have to find her she may
[20:01] be whispering over there I don't think
[20:02] so but all things are better but we

[21:44] careful that take a trigger bummer Santa
[21:47] in Genesis once we see now as why that
[21:51] that you know programs of heat it like
[21:54] that song it's a nice salt his royal
[21:56] blood now flows in my veins no it does
[21:59] now I still got the DNA what mom on mom
[22:02] and a game but when I'm changed when
[22:05] it's outside person change it will be
[22:08] changed to what a body like his glorious
[22:10] body which came right straight from the
[22:11] word ago so the DNA of God is the word
[22:14] of God if you want to see we want to go
[22:16] back to the pattern of one of your black
[22:19] why you got a different I different
[22:22] mouth wait
[22:22] don't you know the do's and don'ts with
[22:24] your body that's in your genetic power
[22:27] of your staff in your strand all the
[22:30] same thing here
[22:31] I can tell a Christian night and run
[22:34] around you know he said give me two
[22:35] minutes and somebody knows I tell you
[22:37] where these are holes open on I don't
[22:39] believe it discernment tree I deserve it
[22:41] but they're sort of things that you can
[22:42] say that people or even hear that people
[22:45] say and you know they do something
[22:48] well something going on something I why
[22:51] because the characteristics of this
[22:54] genetic made us has not come in and
[22:56] vulcanized I like that word vulcanize
[22:58] because most people don't know how to
[23:01] explain well enough well can i did you
[23:04] trade rubber and rubber you don't take
[23:06] rubber metal you don't a brother in
[23:09] plastic now pipe lack get the part of
[23:12] rubber but plastic melts to the floor
[23:14] temperatures in rubber does
[23:15] but if you say rubber rubber so you had
[23:17] to have that predestination come from
[23:19] God right and then when God comes in he
[23:23] takes and burns that's why the Holy
[23:25] Ghost and fire he burns out that old
[23:27] nature and when you take them and when
[23:30] you remelt something even plastic you
[23:32] remelt it you said two things like this
[23:35] plastic here and this plastic here and
[23:37] you put them in a pot and melt them
[23:40] you'll never separate next planet you
[23:44] can't find the separation because it's
[23:46] the molecules of this plastic or rubber
[23:49] has vulcanized with this plastic or
[23:51] rubber and it's so intertwined but when
[23:53] you can see the past now in a natural
[23:55] aspect we can't see the past because I
[23:58] know Joel knows know some of y'all that
[24:00] we used to ride bicycles man you get a
[24:02] whole new bicycle you ain't got your
[24:04] rubber potty you can do plastic water a
[24:07] metal one you got a rubber packet you
[24:09] took them help you can you just--can you
[24:12] get something from an off of the smoke
[24:13] you can get a splitter hit like this bit
[24:16] the one it flips over you know and you
[24:19] said then you heat that thing almost it
[24:21] melt it be almost boys then you put a
[24:23] little bit good on it we
[24:24] pass on it well it becomes one but you
[24:27] can see that but not in God and God you
[24:29] can't see this the scenes when you come
[24:32] together when that Genesis one man comes
[24:34] in now that's what do you want either
[24:35] chocolate he just took us around the
[24:38] world to get that you see it took us it
[24:41] just comes up coming in human flesh to
[24:44] have that come into it but these are and
[24:47] see that's difficult this is not a new
[24:49] birth this is an impartation of eternal
[24:54] life this is not a new birth trip the 50
[24:56] of you does not receive the baptism of
[24:58] the holy goat like we do because you've
[25:01] got to be alive right to receive the
[25:03] holy up to be reborn you got to be alive
[25:06] these people are dead most of them I
[25:09] mean it's more coming but these people
[25:10] are already dead and then when the white
[25:14] rope has to be given to him God has been
[25:16] part eternal life which you can do
[25:18] anytime you want to but this group of
[25:21] people has a meaning to me though more
[25:24] than that is Grace in this second stage
[25:26] of justification even if they didn't do
[25:30] it and you're not going to look at these
[25:33] people when we get the glory no it's a
[25:35] pit filled view that made it to them
[25:37] you'll made it under under the door you
[25:39] know they just barely know you know why
[25:42] you will hug your neck so they're the
[25:46] hands of into them the implanted right
[25:48] we want to make in you and that's why I
[25:51] was getting Mac right now look at it now
[25:55] that way thought that is a special group
[25:57] and that special group II told you so it
[26:00] gives me faith for that justification
[26:05] because you know what there's no worse
[26:10] than I was another Center I turned the
[26:14] Word of God down I did to think that
[26:17] what that I listed what are them to men
[26:20] that yeah I was a Gentile how was it I
[26:25] love that blinded by the maker I was
[26:28] over here in another group given a
[26:30] choice
[26:31] exactly great grace on both sides
[26:37] Amazing Grace on both sides
[26:40] amazing grace to see this is a part of
[26:42] the plan of God and just even I was a
[26:45] part of planning ugh but if it hadn't
[26:46] been for that part of the plan I would
[26:48] be okay
[26:49] amen so let's don't think let's don't
[26:52] belittle this fish till geologists they
[26:55] know what they're doing then does bears
[26:56] amaze know they were any plans off they
[26:58] went a plan purpose of God vision part
[27:01] of the condescending of God because I
[27:03] see mounds that more very slimming than
[27:05] ever before that God gets grapes he
[27:07] integrate you didn't just give great
[27:09] history so until your fifth seal now
[27:12] grace justification comes to you which
[27:14] is a higher all right because look let
[27:19] me tell that then we'll go
[27:21] the first justification you can be
[27:24] justified and still down go ahead the
[27:27] second part of this justification you
[27:29] cannot die know that so we got that
[27:34] higher form
[27:35] you've already been born again those
[27:37] double bring you back out and make me
[27:39] start over again no this part of
[27:41] justification is what what I said the
[27:43] first revelation for the body change I
[27:45] start to get into my memory reason
[27:48] conscious affection imagination I have
[27:50] got to get that Genesis 1:26 man to take
[27:53] over that next realm then you ought to
[27:57] know I did I was there when I did but
[28:01] the real we didn't do the real one that
[28:04] says that that the real one that
[28:06] motivates me now was that that's why I
[28:09] don't that's why I don't see how people
[28:12] can believe that they came there with
[28:13] eternal life how can you come here with
[28:16] eternal life in your soul and do the
[28:18] things you did yeah I don't care if you
[28:20] lost a bit of lobster or a nunnery
[28:23] yeah never touch your carmine is what
[28:27] killed him these carnal honey one killed
[28:29] her it wasn't her body function that was
[28:31] the part you let in here so we're all
[28:34] born in sin Satan iniquity but yeah
[28:36] I did that representation yes but he
[28:41] wasn't here while the brother I say the
[28:45] Holy Ghost the fire comes in at the new
[28:46] birth burns out the old nature well he
[28:49] was already in there why did he just do
[28:51] the work while he's in there
[28:52] no I'm born in sin I just like to
[28:54] believe the old fashion I would love and
[28:57] if I had known God I went ahead but by
[29:02] the foreknowledge of God knowing that I
[29:04] would want it at a point he would meet
[29:07] me and I would say okay I said that and
[29:09] then now means that it was that far in
[29:12] justification now him accepting me okay
[29:15] here's the next part so he's gotta
[29:18] accept me here after I'm born again here
[29:22] they said why because we're going for a
[29:25] change we're not going just for our soul
[29:27] become it's already turned we're going
[29:30] to where you got to get that outside man
[29:31] not this man not this not the place
[29:34] maybe the black is just nothing but a
[29:36] robot it just is just where everything
[29:38] is by some I did the other day your
[29:42] bones are just to hold you muscles
[29:43] together
[29:43] you mustn't let it hold you both
[29:45] together and all their oh your and
[29:47] keeping fall down basically but the
[29:51] firing mechanism inside is mixed
[29:53] together with what we ought to worry
[29:55] about that's why I can have a heart
[29:58] transplant from somebody that's a dead
[30:01] loss center and that don't hurt my soul
[30:03] at all that don't change me but now
[30:07] remember like though they'll always did
[30:09] they've never done a brain transplant
[30:10] why because that's where that fire
[30:12] mechanism in that for that memory
[30:15] reasoning concentration imaginate all
[30:18] that company right easy remember you all
[30:21] over this exact thing are here up here
[30:24] right your mind is your mind
[30:26] well a thank you brain memory reads an
[30:29] angry reads you reasonable you body no
[30:32] conscious all your conscious and
[30:34] subconscious this control volume and
[30:37] affection come from here remember always
[30:41] be you know the greatest be own the
[30:46] greatest organism art
[30:47] your large ordination can put your grass
[30:50] or it in your brain because if your
[30:52] brain stops you're done okay
[30:55] intervention your fashion doesn't come
[30:57] from though this part of your heart you
[30:59] know you it comes from here why because
[31:02] it all connects for your burning your
[31:04] brand what tell you what to do when to
[31:07] do it how you guys and that you did it
[31:09] that way before right so that's why we
[31:13] can't do brain transplant the soul is
[31:15] not in your brain but your branch is
[31:17] that firing mechanism I was looking
[31:19] yesterday you know we're dealing with
[31:21] with Jim's mother heaven and you take a
[31:26] brand of a normal person which is you
[31:28] know solve it you see all these call
[31:30] them ridges and everything in it then
[31:32] you got the court day you lose your
[31:34] dress daily and it's not black it's
[31:36] actually milky living but at all times
[31:39] patient that's the way their brain looks
[31:42] and this part right here is totally
[31:45] black it's rotting from the inside out
[31:50] those nerve endings if I go they'll fit
[31:52] you know when you learn how to ride
[31:53] bicycle your nerve anything's go
[31:55] together and that's your memories that
[31:56] route that reminds you with how ride
[31:59] Liza all right go to store or how to
[32:02] Greece's radicals you what my brain goes
[32:05] is here
[32:06] right my brain don't do right but
[32:09] now in Alzheimer's patient they start
[32:13] actually rotting from the inside out and
[32:15] that's what was what the brain looks
[32:16] like a big like a watermelon with the
[32:19] inside hold out and it with this black
[32:21] there in other words there's no life
[32:23] there's no firing mechanism as there
[32:25] well to me that's always saying is
[32:26] that's the same way we have so much sin
[32:29] in our in our not in just our natural
[32:31] brain goes remember that don't go
[32:33] through that you can go through that
[32:35] gray matter but you send when you soak
[32:39] you're sending from the deep dark inside
[32:41] of you you can't what I'm saying is you
[32:44] taste that well my brain if there's my
[32:46] brain I born with this brain no you
[32:50] bring order but there's a firing
[32:53] mechanism
[32:53] I'm the organ and it's called a
[32:55] theophany our soul and your soul is the
[33:00] real Youth Center our thing
[33:04] that's why that we can be good and an
[33:08] animal can't be do an animal can't be
[33:10] good for what they do right but we're
[33:13] just and that happy day what there are
[33:16] going to be just as God did something to
[33:18] that group of people and said I'm going
[33:21] to blind them I mean my one that we
[33:26] talked about last night what about Jesus
[33:28] came in every way of Bible settings no
[33:31] come remember that for me just for a
[33:34] moment there was no he sent no Manuel is
[33:39] not asked before they had the Torah and
[33:42] maybe some of the little books go
[33:45] remember the little boats come later
[33:46] they definitely had the Torah that Moses
[33:49] stroke you know make it work mode we're
[33:53] moved to we know that I am only talking
[33:56] money but you take that and you look and
[33:59] you see that that Jesus came exactly the
[34:03] way about what all it was you come the
[34:07] old emergency bring for the child adult
[34:10] any language you know where Jesus to me
[34:13] I be so frustrated I walk into a temple
[34:16] none go
[34:17] what part of this did I miss you know I
[34:22] break won't book got him all under life
[34:24] I came as a virgin no you didn't you
[34:28] were born forked I came as this I came
[34:31] to this and they kept going no no kitty
[34:35] he's not he's pretending to be God but
[34:38] he came just the way God said he won't
[34:40] come
[34:40] that's the blindness then and let it
[34:43] blood be on us and our children right
[34:46] here our children which is coming up to
[34:49] now but God said okay but I'll not
[34:51] forget you I won't forgive you I'm not
[34:55] gonna forget you but I'm not gonna let
[34:57] you
[34:57] where I had you in my position is why
[34:59] you'll not be my life anymore you're
[35:02] going to be serviced but you're going to
[35:04] get eternal life cause I blinded your us
[35:08] so that you couldn't see the great
[35:11] Messiah I'm standing before you so what
[35:14] a great comedian fifty was just well as
[35:18] head for the apex is head towards the
[35:19] look there is nothing in this
[35:23] that's filial up you know well naughty
[35:26] people feel your love is like this all
[35:29] of my husband all the time you are not
[35:33] feeling well now job a lot of takes over
[35:37] and you love your husband if you're born
[35:40] again and they're born again then that's
[35:42] one of the other boxes to can't walk if
[35:44] they don't agree because you're going to
[35:46] be it's like II do a lot of well all you
[35:49] want to fill you up it's only just say I
[35:51] mean it's not even you can't see it aim
[35:54] on the picture comes up a little but
[35:56] there's not much great in filial love
[35:58] come on people you can imagine uh big
[36:00] man who I woke up for three whole days
[36:01] it was your fault I goes out there and
[36:04] then your fault anemia if you come there
[36:05] fall then you blame your kids your kids
[36:10] did it right that's not filial I mean I
[36:13] thought agape love
[36:14] that's agape love yes right they hated
[36:18] me get on the low enough giving her one
[36:22] they hated me they they denied me and
[36:25] turn me balance it you're not even say
[36:28] you are so let's take this grace and
[36:31] embrace it because once we get to right
[36:34] here this divine love does not go from
[36:38] memories and conservation imagination it
[36:40] works through it it works really you
[36:43] always don't have to work through your
[36:44] brain Blackey telling you you got it
[36:47] right so you built on the whole ego
[36:48] you got to run it through your memory
[36:51] reason on suspense amazing
[36:52] all right let's active I love is the
[36:55] doctor love it we don't
[36:56] understand because what's going to
[36:59] happen is is from filial love this body
[37:02] can well so there is no live it up right
[37:07] that one is dead Robin on his way to
[37:09] hell so they come from except to keep
[37:11] love but now when I guess is 1.6 man
[37:14] which to me is I got below when it moves
[37:18] in and takes over then it turns out all
[37:21] the other I love my wife more now
[37:23] because under standard for what
[37:25] born-again Christians we don't always
[37:30] know mountain so might only one down
[37:35] these it takes to madly to make one
[37:38] metal thanks to Valley tomato out so you
[37:47] go out a lot of this but in the valley
[37:49] and you alright so keep that off there
[37:53] so then let's make it so much they
[37:57] always yeah Wow well get the level and
[38:02] I'm getting for it but hoping my letters
[38:04] ok let's go yes I know
[38:07] and after some a Leo that's just a human
[38:12] [Music]
[38:19] pleasure my last corneas let me make
[38:21] this point the reason I can take a body
[38:25] change is that I can realize that God
[38:28] overcomes everything that they did to
[38:30] give them eternal life so does going to
[38:32] overcome everything I do to give me one
[38:34] chance so don't think you would do our
[38:37] jumping left hand does not know hand
[38:39] they thought this right they got this
[38:43] figure mystically know an animal just
[39:02] does not move away can you comment
[39:06] pregnant for the hounds are out control
[39:09] that's why no we need to get that yet
[39:11] better time worker truck is no she is
[39:15] taking animal extra in my eyes and it's
[39:18] just about the wife of our gala bottle
[39:22] to bring order to the name of Jesus
[39:24] Christ to make this organ orders extend
[39:27] hearing me talk about you lord played
[39:30] just does not that he cannot stand you
[39:33] learn to be spoken so that was the name
[39:36] of the Lord Jesus Christ by the word

[39:44] review their thing and even one of time
[39:47] that believer and everything will be
