========================================

amen good morning everyone good morning uh we're going to read from psalm 102 verses 1 through 20. you know i listed some other day and i heard this in the early pentecost is one of the guys he he prayed five hours a day and he wasn't receiving what he wanted he said lord what must i do he said pray more and he went to seven hours a day and they started a movement of pentecost on the west coast amen so if we think we prayed enough let's pray more that's right let's pray now heavenly father we are grateful and we're thankful this morning love for this privilege and opportunity lord you have brought us together lord we pray that your holy spirit will bind our hearts even closer lord in time of our trouble and need just let us keep praying and seeking you lord that you come into us and deliver god we thank you and for all these that are sick today lord just bless them and guide them for every need that everyone have father just let us pray that you would give it unto us in jesus christ and we pray amen we're going to psalm 102 hear my prayer oh lord and let my cry come unto thee for my days i consume like smoke my bones are burned ass in heart by reason of the voice of my groaning my bones have cleaved to my skin i watch and i am as a sparrow alone upon the house for i have eaten ashes like bread and mingle my drink with weeping my days are like a shatter that declineth and i am withered like grass thou shall arise and have mercy upon zion for the time to favor her eye to favor her yea the set time has come so the heathen shall fear the name of the lord and all the kings of the earth thy glory he will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise their prayer for he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary from heaven dear the lord behold the earth to hear the groaning of the prison to loose those that are pointing to death amen god bless you okay let's turn over to 176 and spiral board that's 176 blessed assurance jesus blessed

study oh downstairs in the sunday school room and where we eat there is a video camera thing etc you say it you know that's there announcing all of the special services all right so if you ever want to know just go downstairs and look there's no excuse for somebody coming along and saying well i didn't know that was going on all of the services you know to the announcement of the bible study to be coming up in you know the first week in february gives you the time gives you the fellowship meeting coming up when it's coming it gets all of the things on the wall there now so go down and read them you know and see what they are and then you'll know all about it amen and remember now especially this band quit that we have you know a lot of you people never get together with each other you have no fellowship well you know we offer once a year for a husband and wife to get together come and have a fellowship time with other brothers and sisters from the church well you know what's the problem we we take care of everything there's no trouble the place is there and we want you to come a couple together and that way we can fellowship as a church together all right and bringing your wife out for a night out why not don't you think that much of her that once a year you could take her out for a meal and a fellowship together don't cost nothing all it is just to fellowship together all we ask you to do dress up you know a little because you ought to in honor of the rest of the people and you know and no children allowed or nothing because it is you can't handle that there in the building so it's supposed to be for the husband and wife and then to for us to fellowship together amen well all right you may not like me but at least one time a year you could put up with me for a couple hours you know to do that all right is that honest but just you know remember that and they're down on an announcement everything's being announced and but make sure now for the band quit that you sign up because you know we have to know about the food the the doings and everything how to set and arrange and and everything all right so do those things amen are you enjoying the series that wade is bringing we just pray that the lord bless i ask you still again if you'll listen to questions and answers on genesis or read it it's in the conduct order and doctrine book the book number one i think it's some first message might not be but it's questions and answers on genesis so because that's what we're still on is going through some of those things all right but just pray one for another okay let's sing as our brother comes to minister the word of the lord unto us right open the eyes of my heart open tell us the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy you love him this morning i amen the angels sing it every day all day long but buddy when a child of god asks something from his father they shut up because our daddy wants to hear what the kids have to say amen what an expression what an expression of love those angels were created just for one thing for worship and they can't sing the same songs we sing never been lost never had a bad day in their life never went through ups and downs and can't call him daddy they can't call the almighty father they just worship him as a holy creator but we know him as the lord jesus christ amen good to be back in the house of the lord good to have all of you here full house today that's good i told um june the other day we're getting on temperance but i needed to get you mad enough before we started to see how it would work so uh i hope i did last sunday if i didn't i'll start again today you know brother brown said got to put a man in your way right say something to see how you would react not how he'd react how you'd react so some of you reacted wonderful like sonny you didn't come back second server so that's okay second peter 1 verse 1 through 11. i'm just quoting bible here people it's just the bible we've forgotten how to be christians brother dale and i were talking about this going down to pick up brother luis good to have him back ma'am lord did a mighty work down there with his body and with his soul preaching to the people and and uh interpreting and got to preach itself so he uh he took you down there with you so it's good to see him back all good and all good and healthy now before we read the announcements all we dad went through all of them uh the monitor downstairs please read that thing because it takes the place of that little thing we used to write downstairs and it continues to scroll so you can read and figure out what time things are and as as far away as the father's day fishing trip in june so it's it tells you when where and what's going on so i thank brother joe and brother richard roberts and um brother bob and brother anderson and all them that put all that together to make that happen so it'll always be before you so if you can you know if you read it you will uh not have to come up to two days before and say what are y'all talking about we have had that happen several times announce it every sunday and and the people not uh not understand it also i'd like to apologize for wednesday night that was not a cell phone that went off that was my ipad on the front seat i had it on i had it on with the bible you know reading about with pulling up the bible and the scriptures and all and somebody's son that i work with now jacob sent me a text and it dinged well he didn't just send the text to me sent to somebody else and somebody else sent him one and it dinged so by the time i got it off it done dinged a couple of times so it's off now you won't ever be able to hear it but it was an ipad it wasn't an iphone so but it was mine it was eyes so i apologize i apologize that was it was mine on the front row you know i'm sorry i apologize for that just have a little patience with me because i forget some things sometimes i told you in this morning i said you're going to have a treat tomorrow she's never been with a 55 year old man before she will tomorrow tomorrow be my 55th birthday so i'll be double nickels and marlow over there he's going to be 173 tomorrow so downhill from now on the twins have a birthday today we have several people that are that have are celebrating birthdays but lord bless you you know what this i'd rather be here than anywhere else so i not uh not worried about time uh time will take care of itself we just gotta worry about getting ready hey man gotta worry about getting ready to get out of here sega peter one remember too also is uh i have a little uh app on that iphone that reminds me it it dings every time there's there's 30 days left for me to fly out to the philippines so it reminded me this morning that i got 30 days so just keep me in your prayers that we will uh we're looking for a good time in the lord hey man let's bow our heads before we get started dear lord jesus we pray today lord that as we were back there in the back and old brother bob come upstairs with tears in his eyes and a smile on his face and said the lord came down in the sunday school class this morning and blessed somebody so i hugged him and wanted some of that on me so i pray that it will help each and every one of us as we believe in your anointing father we believe in the holy spirit but we also believe in adding on a little add to your faith because the prophet of god said faith won't do it alone it takes all these virtues to make a perfect man father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make against you lord we commit them all to you please be the active participant in this service not a bystander lord a recording of our thoughts and ideas because most of the time they're wrong father but we pray today that we would focus our attention solely on you lord get away from the man and listen to the voice father because in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound this mystery this christ in you the hope of glory will be finished we pray that you'd be with the sick ones that are among us and the ones that are not here lord thanks for bringing the ones back that have been sick we actually continue to bless us anoint us with that healing anointing the healing anointing power that's still in your word father it's never diminished just bless us now lord take care of us take care of us in jesus name amen ii peter 1 verse 1. it's wonderful to see somebody walk upstairs crying like a baby and saying boy the spirit of the lord fail that's good that's that's a good start to a good any service simon peter and the servant apostle jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith such to a group of people that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power not man's power not your thoughts but the divine power have given unto us all things that pertain us unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that called us to glory and virtue whereby are given so they're gifts unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these the prophet said these promises see these promises you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and that's not just that's a lot of other things we're going to talk about today uh that word lust uh we may get into a little bit but it's not just only uh beastly lust it's lust for all a lot of things you know when we see that word lush we think well it's a you know it's a sexual thing but it's really not you can have lush for a lot of things right all right and besides this giving all diligence beside this in other words besides adding this divine nature beside this giving all diligence add to your faith not somebody else's not the pastor's faith not your wife's faith not the faith of your neighbor your faith so this is personal add to your faith virtue to virtue knowledge and all his temperance the temperance patience patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and the brother kindness charity for if there's that word if you have to decide if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ the reason we're bearing or not bearing fruit is that right there right if these things be in you in the bound they make you but verse nine but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins that's what i'm trying to stir up today that lack of these things is blind and can't see it far off we might think we're way up here in the top of the pyramid but if if you don't live them and people don't see them i don't care what comes out of your mouth right hey man it doesn't matter to me anymore what comes out of somebody's mouth we got to live at life wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling in election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word you shall never what a promise you shall never fall you say oh we fall all the time no we backslide it's like william brother william said he said some of us you know back sliding is slow some people just fall off the cliff all right that's not backsliding back sliding is backing up slow are just staying in the same place so now let's see let's pull the pyramid back up here and uh the chart and we're going to go through and just background just for a few minutes because i i enjoy background in a little bit even for us it's been here the whole time we still need the background a little bit all right so remember this is the center piece of the message to me it hinges on whether you get the body whether you take a body change and be alive or whether you have to die and go by the grave this is the hinge point the the center piece now whether you believe it or not this age requires you to have this before you take a body change and not die all right so there's life and death has been presented to you just like moses said moses comes over and he said life and death has been presented to you well today life and death is being presented to you if you're not a believer you're not going to believe it that makes you an unbeliever but if you're a believer then believing these things as we were talking about believing these things actually believing gives you a desire it gives you a desire if you believe that god's going to do this for you you got to have a desire because if you don't then if you lack these things you're blind what blind not physically blind spiritually you don't have a revelation mama why are you doing something over there i looked over and saw an empty nest good to see uh good to see tommy and brother ernest with us today but uh i lost you there for a minute i have to figure i'd see if mama's there so when everything's all right ain't nothing like that mama nod nothing like it if you sit there and do like this you better go crawl under a bench somewhere brother brown said the mother knows right the mother's the one that knows she's the one that knows how you act and that you know she knows how you are can't fool a mama hey man can't fool the mama and sister trudy yeah nyla you go over there and just check your head uh-huh yo she was like shaking her head looking at her mama so she knows can't get away from that but it's got to be a desire because each one of these virtues sure we got the holy ghost down here at faith faith equals the new birth equal to the holy ghost all right but we must have brother brian remember he said faith alone won't do it now faith will get you in the body faith will get you into the new birth where you can be in the family of god and you get all the you get all the benefits of being in the family but getting the benefits and using them are two different things right you can go to the reading of the will which that's what we're doing today you can go to the reading of the well but you can say no i don't want that i don't want that it sure you can you can say i don't want that give it to somebody else well that's what these virtues are these virtues are promises or gifts that god has given us put in the church for us to what become a perfect man right now look your soul is already perfect getting your birth right your soul is already perfect got the new birth all right but you have to grow in grace and knowledge in this guy this guy's got to grow because the holy ghost never had to grow it he is what it is he's the great i am he's the one that knows everything and that's the problem with us i say us all of us is the reason we've been here still for 50 years since the prophet left because we haven't realized what we got when we got the holy ghost it took a prophet of god to bring us to a level to really understand what the new birth was all right that it was all these virtues working in your life not just being there because jesus all these virtues was in him and working amen all right he walked brother brown said in the world of perfect faith right he walked in a world of perfect faith and obviously he had virtue we read it the other day how virtue went from him sure he had so much knowledge he confounded the scholars uh temperance uh he should have got a lot more mad than he did old fools and slow of heart now what if i told you all that you know you know i heard a brother the other day saying that jesus was was a mild man or guy well no he wasn't he was and he had compassion for everybody but when he come to that because you always have problems with the religious people he didn't have problems with the drunks he didn't have problems with the prostitutes he had problems with the religious people right with the religious people and he would say hey you got a different daddy than me and they perceived what he was talking about finally and they got mad at him and they wanted to stone him so that's the same way it's going to be it's going to be the religious people that's going to push us not the sinners the sinners really don't care really they don't i mean if they're unbelievers they're just unbelievers i mean you know if you what you got to have is you got to have that virtue to draw them in right all right you got to have virtue temperance and obviously jesus had patience he was god so he presented godliness brotherly kindness and then absolutely he was the most loved that ever was given because he gave his life when he didn't have to he gave his life for everybody not just his chosen he gave his life for everybody so this is actually a a study on the new birth but it's also a study on how to act once you get the new birth right all right so i just want a kind of background for some that hadn't been here in a little bit and these are all overcomings you are not going to i told i told my cousin the other day and he kind of liked it we met with terry dale he's letting us borrow a part of his warehouse to use for our beekeeping adventure so we were talking about all these things and i said yeah i said he said it's been a rough week i said yeah we didn't we weren't called with spoons and forks we weren't called to a picnic we were called to a battle with swords and shields and he liked that because he probably never heard that before but but that's it it's true this is not a picnic to overcome means you gotta overcome who first you all right then you gotta overcome all the adversity that goes around you and remember you must suffer the rain right suffer the rain but and power without character see you can have power you shall receive power we'll read it a minute once the holy ghost comes all right you receive power but how you use it is either going to be a stumbling block to the unbeliever or even satanic to the nature that you'll use it wrong all right that's the truth that's the truth anyhow whether you believe it or not all right now and also like we were talking about all these are nice that's a pretty drawing but how do we get them go to ephesians 4 we'll cut it down real short because we've read it already but ephesians 4 this is peter telling us what we need but it's going to be ephesians 4 that paul picks up and brother dale and i were talking going to pick up police the other day you know honestly the point that i made was who's writing this who's writing this paul paul right the holy ghost but paul's writing this he didn't get it from the ephesians that's right sure he got it from god but where did he get the virtues from right old testament he pulled them by the holy ghost the filter pulled it out of that old testament that's all paul had he didn't have a bible right he didn't have a quote book he was making the quote book amen so he pulled it out of the old testament i wished i had time because then it began i began thinking about all the things that happened in the old testament that could bring out virtue knowledge temperance because that's all paul had now he may have heard peter preach about it he may have but what if he didn't because remember paul spent time out here and peter was over here and when they come together the prophet of god said they were preaching the same thing amen all right so paul pulls it out of the old testament this right here he gave some apostles prophets evangelists and pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints so you can't get it any other way before the perfecting of the saints the work of the ministry edifying of the body of christ teal so in other words we do have a journey till we come to the unity of the faith the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ all right so that's how we get it and look hebrews 5 14. let's just run through these scriptures again but strong meat belonging to them they're of full age i see babies do babies have a characteristic right right but adults have another characteristic okay it's not that they do away with them they take what they had and they what by reason of use see a 14 year old kid says i can drive that car no exercising right he's got a practice heard the old addis practice what you preach well you got to practice says even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern and that's what we come into knowledge is discernment between good and evil all right so strong meat belongs to them they're full age now everybody's not at full age but at least if you get yourself under the fountain of a full-aged minister amen because if he still if a preacher is still a baby you're not going to grow if a preacher is a baby because you can't go in a higher power if he's preaching baby that's okay but everybody must continue up that ladder right even the preachers amen all right now let's go to hebrews 6. therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on into perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead worse and of faith toward god now we covered all that of the doctrine of baptism and of laying on of hands and resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment and this will we do if god permits all right so paul's saying we gotta take that foundation and build on it all right hebrews 11 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him who god for he that cometh to god must believe that he is is what god and a rewarder of them that diligently there's that word diligent paul liked that word and so did peter diligently seek him and then hebrews 11 1 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen now let's go back to our chart just one second and realize one thing's for sure it's going to take a lot of faith because it's real wide down here but watch how it narrows up but it's going to take a lot of faith put that first chart back up um brother anderson because look faith is the substance of things hoped for right the evidence of things not seen now you can't take we were talking about that a few minutes ago you can't take my brain out and show me virtue so it's unseen but it can be shown right it can be manifested same way with brother dale what he's preaching you know you can't see god but the vessel he's in is manifesting who that person is and this look faith is the substance what is the substance it's something more real because to me your new birth is more real than you are we must realize if we realize that the new birth that we got is more real than this man you see standing here then that man will take over the problems being is we've had this man suppress that man so much till he can't work but by use by exercising strong muscles of faith to me now when i read faith is the substance here's the substance that's right this is the substance of your faith you can't have these virtues without having this faith first you can have human ones but not temperance faith and knowledge faith and virtue faith like we've been talking about because it comes straight from god all right so you have to start here and this is the substance of things hoped for the evidence because what this is going to be in evidence this is going to be it's going to be evident who has these virtues because brother braham said you know where you're at at god with god at any time so the substance of this faith of my faith from now on the substance of my faith is going to be those things right there that's the substance the only way i'm going to show my faith is by living those virtues all right everybody is that okay all right but there it's a belief and a conviction it's a conviction we must we must be convinced that this is the end time we must be confined convinced that god sent us a prophet but we also need to be convinced that somebody has come to speak to you to bring you to these things because you're not going to get them sitting out under a tree or where you think you can sit in your living room and get them you can't right right all right you just can't i you can you just can't because the bible says you can't all right so now let's go to now we remember we went through justification outside court sanctification still outside but here's the inner court this is the holy of holies this is where you and god alone are you have a lot of things go on here and not be in the body of christ but once you receive that new birth because remember you can get the holy ghost and not be born again on your spirit an anointing all right but once you get the new birth that means you have been what regen are regenerated from that man that we were talking about this man that was born of samuel and peggy dale now there's not two or three people in me and i'm not schizophrenic right okay but when god comes in and he molds to my soul brother brown talks about vulcanize he vulcanizes that thing together and when he does then it's not god's faith anymore it's your faith amen because it didn't say add to god's faith it said add to your faith the faith that you got add verse you shall now let's go to the chart with virtue on it now remember you got to add to what you believe these virtues what you believe because remember we'll read that quote in a few minutes let's read let's go and read quote one two and three i'm sorry i skipped ahead here sorry brother anderson i heard him could be put in reverse thought you a perfect man this is one i like i'm going to read it every time that we're here notice you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith that's right so you see on my chart here i got the very foundation faith is the foundation of all of it now scroll all the way up to here you're possessed of one that dominates your life just depends on how much faith you have is how high you can rise so it's left all up to you you can study to make yourself approved or you can sit there and you know whatever you want to do we can't make you that's one thing for sure but first it's got to be faith let me stay on that foundation for a while faith is what you must believe so you got to believe it and what is it it's a holy evidence right you can you can present a little bit of virtue of knowledge but it's got to be a holy virtue or what we call virtue faith now go to that one now the chart of virtue faith add to what you believe virtue all right which is virtue faith right here there's virtue of faith that's what we're climbing up the ladder we're going up the ladder there to perfection all right remember we're working on life and godliness so we're working on the life we live plus the godly part of us being christians mark 5 verse 30 just to kind of get to i'm going to try to get to one more virtue and then we'll do the next one this evening mark 5 verse 30 and jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes all right so there's the virtue part that we're looking at something had gone out of him which virtue now we understand is what strength virtue is strength because what did jesus tell them here in let's define virtue it should come up next all right see it's called dunamis which is power mighty work and strength so your faith has got strength but brother brown said remember your faith has to have muscles remember he said your faith has got to have muscles all right but it's an inherent power so when you get the new birth that power's in there it's inherent power residing in a thing by virtue of its nature so see we're talking about the very nature of god so the virtues are the very nature of god all right but you still are on free moral agency you can choose every day whether to accept or reject what you hear what you see and what you do all right see that comes to me up to knowledge but you got to have virtue or strength you got to have a strong faith before you can have knowledge not just faith faith alone won't do it remember you've got to have virtue faith which is a strength faith moral power and excellence of soul listen all these things are overcomings you can put the word overcoming and all that right because look without moral power what are you going to be i am m-o-r-a-l you're going to be immoral without moral power you're going to do immoral things right we all did right right but with moral but with the new birth it gives us moral power and excellence of soul that puts it right down into person right all right let's go to acts 1 verse 8. this is the same dunamis jesus telling them you shall receive power after right that the holy ghost has come upon you after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and judea and samaria and to the uttermost parts of the earth and to me and you that uttermost part means us because it came to you and i but remember he didn't just say that to the disciples he said it to us you shall receive power dunamis virtue after that the holy ghost has come upon you because in acts 3 i didn't put it down but you you remember in acts 3 what happened peter he has no money he doesn't have a you know he's probably quit his job because he's going around preaching and teaching and all that you know and and trying to live off the ties of the people that probably didn't work very well but he didn't have no money for this man he said silver and gold have i none but such as i have i give unto you what'd he give him that power that power that came out of him that man he said look on us well see that was very powerful because what he done he got his attention the prophet of god he got his attention to quit looking at all the other stuff and you know what i believe the man the man entered into a channel to even forget about that his legs didn't work right he there and that's what we have to do we got to enter into a channel of so much faith till we forget about what we're hurting or what's doing this or what's doing that to us he entered into so much of a channel of virtue that he forgot that he couldn't walk right right he forgot he couldn't walk because the next thing that happened was peter reaches and gets him picks him up and the bible says strength entered into his legs all right well it wasn't there before it had come from somewhere so that's the same thing with you and i in this virtue faith that we must have this powerful faith and it's a substance that's added to your faith right because faith is a substance all right talk about the generator the other day we'll talk about you know plugging in the generator we believe that generator has power so we plug into that generator and we're able to do things well you know what the generator is that's god himself he's the he don't need an atomic power he doesn't need he doesn't need georgia power to do anything for him no he has his own power right and you know what he didn't say he didn't keep it he gave it out he gave the blessings out to me and you so that we can plug into that generator and we can get something from god all right let's go to quote number four statue of a perfect man i like this one because you know what you can have virtue like i said many times before there are and it's a characteristic that that we all we haven't won or we don't have it you can have a i've seen teachers that shouldn't be teachers i'm talking about natural i'm talking about natural i'm not talking about here i'm talking about natural teachers in the world that went to school 18 years got 73 degrees and couldn't teach a mule how to turn around and walk the other direction right it's just a gift but she but she he or whoever it was they got the power the degrees the knowledge they got all that they just didn't have a way to a pass that can pass through to the people so god says okay i'm going to get a pastor evangelist a teacher a preacher and all these five things and that's my that's my outlet right that's my pass that i'm going to pass it to you when i look it's not a dead end street when it passes to you it keeps going right now all right so i've got to have virtue and a past that it can pass forward from me to the people all right same way with all of us because virtue went out of him to the people before you can let it out you've got to have it first you haven't got it it won't come out there's nothing for it to come out of all right somebody looking at you as a christian and tomorrow see you out there carrying on like a sinner not much virtue can be drawn from that seat right right right what happens is it's like brother brown said it becomes a stumbling block right when you go and you profess one thing and then you act like another and you know what let's be honest a lot of times we do act like sinners oh it's just me then i'm sorry it's just me pray for me maybe i'm the one that needs to be taught all this no it happens to all of us but remember we're human that's human mistakes but it's what we do afterwards that's right it's what we do afterwards we sin every day but you know we ask god to forgive us and it's not just to me it's not just god forgive me and then go on no you really have because godly sorrow leadeth you through repentance something inside of you says i need to repent for that all right so that's the same and that's what virtue is though because what you're drawing from you're drawing from the virtue of god and he's inside of you you don't have to bring it from somewhere you just got to let it come out all right so see you carrying out like a sinner not much virtue can be drawn from that see right okay so now that's virtue virtue is strength power it's a substance that's added to your faith so it's virtue is not something you can you can touch or feel or or you know or draw but it's something that you you live out okay you live it out and there's no way you can live it out unless you have it so you got to have it to live it out and you got to have somebody to teach you how to know that you might already have it do you understand what i'm saying that you might you already got it it's just got to be brought out so i said a good teacher will teach you how to get things done i've always said don't show don't don't tell me how to do something show me how to do it remember the old adage you know take somebody fishing 365 days a year but if you'll ever teach him how to fish one time you won't have to go with him to 364 days he'll know how to fish that same way with the word of god and i believe that's what brother dale's done he's built some character in a lot of us that have that that we can fish now you know we don't have to we don't have to depend on him fishing all the time he is the chief fisherman though he's got a fish first he's our pastor so there's no there's no uh there's no doubt where that comes from yeah man that was a week amen oh well some of you really just can't get over it can you knowledge knowledge we need to have knowledge here's here's one i really enjoy because knowledge to me brings if you got virtue but watch you've got to have knowledge faith so you take the faith that you got and you got to you've got to discern now today you're discerning just like i said last sunday today you're discerning whether i'm telling you the truth or not whether my ways of showing it like brother dale sometimes the way you show it you just got to look at the word look at what the word that's being said jesus was telling those pharisees you bunch of sinners hypocrites i mean he named all that off but he was trying to get them to see they were lost so that when he did die they would know that he died for them and they'd go get saved he wouldn't just tell him sure he knew whether they were lost forever but you know what god knew before he even created a man who was gonna be lost and who wasn't but you know what he's let this thing go six seven eight nine thousand years what a patient god he knows who's going to be saved so brother richard why is he put up with us he's got patience he's got all kinds of patience he said thousands of years of being patient amen that's why i love god and his word so we have knowledge faith so let's go to proverbs 1 just for background the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction now everybody knows what instruction is it's like the scripture that says if you can't take correction you're a different kind of child all right so but fools despise wisdom and just in instruction because what did jesus say he said fools and slow of heart what they didn't take his instruction they didn't they didn't use the wisdom he was given at the time but remember he was talking to the disciples when he said fools old fools and slow of heart but when they received the new birth they weren't fools anymore that's why god had patience proverbs 24 5 just to kind of get get us up to the next one a wise man is strong yeah a man of knowledge increases strength so see you look how god built that faith virtue strength now you come up here to knowledge well you don't do away with that strength you take that strong virtue and you add it to your knowledge amen add to your faith virtue to virtue knowledge to knowledge it's all connected so increases that strength that you have now let's just be real honest you can you can listen to somebody make a speech and get something out of it but boy there's some people that can just hold your attention brother branham could just hold your attention he you know he was and because that was his gift that he could hold your attention and what did you add when you when you saw that the man had strength what you discerned that what he was saying was right okay so you discerned what he was saying was the truth so if you discern what he was saying was the truth then see you go on right on up to temperance and patience because you can't move without having these virtues as they're given they're given in that line because they because god knows the only way we're going to get it is that line or he would have put it another way because remember when god thinks of something he can't change the thought the thought he has has to come straight down not like you and me we can have a thought change it god can't god can't have a thought and then say oops no whatever he said that's what it is that's why we can depend on this the word of god that if he said it it's going to happen all right all right so now the word knowledge means gnosis and it's knowledge signified in general intelligence of course that's man's knowledge the general knowledge of christian religion but look the deeper or more perfect and enlarged knowledge of this religion right such as belongs to what more advanced paul says those that want milk want meat that comes from milk wants meat you never get from one plus one equals two two plus two equals you know four you don't ever get away from that right all right you have to use that right on up into calculus and trigonometry and all those things so you same thing you know the more you look at this um brother bob asked me last sunday he said you were holding out downstairs i said no i just didn't know that two years ago i said god's revealed more to me i wasn't holding it back bob said you've been holding back you didn't say any of that downstairs i said well i'm not holding back i said it's just become more real than it was then amen that's why i know it's a revelation when it becomes more real you think man i got this thing down a statue of a perfect man 60 sermons i can do this and i can walk up here and i can do the same thing again and then god just raised it on up another level and same thing with your understanding your understanding has got to be the same way i can know all this and if i can't get it to the people you got to have a pass you got to be able to get it to the people all right such as belongs to more advanced especially if things lawful and unlawful for christians moral wisdom such as this scene and what right living remember we're talking about life and godliness all right so we're talking about how we live our normal life and beco and be christians and know how to live that life because remember let's be honest we live a christian life all the time honestly we do but 80 of the time it's work home life problems amen it really is that's why you know i have to come here to get my fuel uh and get all that dirty stuff off of you because 80 of the time you live in the flesh all right but that christianity is a hundred percent of the time it's just gotta live out you gotta let it live out if you don't have it it ain't gonna live out all right uh the reason why i'm saying this is i'm getting to a point here that i wanna make i don't think that being at the full stature of a perfect man makes you a god zombie where's louise how about them zombies it don't make you a god zombie you know where you just you're just brainless or or it doesn't actually make you where where that that uh sister sharon has to go up on a hey good to see you has to go up she don't have to go up on the mountain and talk to yoda you understand why i'm calling out just in plain terms you don't have to go you don't have to go to the man you know all the comic books and everything if if there's a wise man he's always whip on the mountain sitting by himself see that doesn't make you that either way it makes you a balanced person a balanced christian is what lives out these virtues and sure he that lacketh these things is blind and that's true we are blind in certain ways i was blind i taught sunday school downstairs i went through all these virtues and i still was blind of certain things until god opened my eyes studying a little bit deeper going over things remember exercising exercising your faith you know if you want to get real good at something you got to learn it you got to exercise it you got to do those things but knowledge the deeper more perfect and enlarged knowledge of this religion all right i say christianity because remember religion can be something else religion can be of the devil but a christian can't be of the devil amen all right let's go to quote number five and let's read what the prophet of god said about this i'm spending a little too much time on this but i'm sorry i i think we need to really get down if we don't get these down here at the bottom them up here at the top brother brown said if you don't have them those first ones right you're going to fall off and then thirdly you add knowledge knowledge now that don't mean worldly knowledge because that's foolishness to god but knowledge to judge judge what right from wrong how do you judge it then if you got christian knowledge with your virtue he's what he say your virtue it now has become your virtue all right christian knowledge with your virtue and faith you judge whether the word is right or wrong all right even when we judge let me add this even when we judge that it's right we've still got a avenue that we got to go through we just can't hey listen we can all say the word of god's right close the book and go home now is it really that no you know better than that because remember the devil was there when this was rope if you can lay aside all your creeds and your unbelief everything that you claim to have done then you have knowledge to believe that god cannot lie let every man's word be a lie but mind be true see now you're getting knowledge that's supreme knowledge you don't have to have four degrees in some college or something like that to have it because all these virtues are given to you by god to place upon the foundation of your faith that you hey i like the brother puts it all back on you that you might come to the full stature of a real living man of god yes sir i like that quote let's go to the next one because i want to strike that and then we're going to get into temperance i'll make you all mad for a second service i really want you to get mad with yourself i got mad with myself when i started doing when i even when i started over that i should have brother bob i should have dug a little bit deeper i was a little dilatory in studying that i didn't go way deep into these things but um not knowing that god was you know gonna help us do this or you're getting to be a pretty good man right now you're coming up what with with faith then with virtue then knowledge see how it's building this man you can see there's no way escaping it this is the way to become in the full stature of christ yes sir to judge judge wright judge whether it's right or wrong to believe god's word judge whether it's right or wrong whether i should serve a creed or serve god judge whether it's right or wrong i should be born again or join a church then you beginning then you beginning judge right when the preacher says the days and miracles has passed the bible says jesus christ the same yesterday and forever now which you're going to believe see it all comes still back to you it's what you believe is what going to determine it all right so let's uh let me say a few things here and then we'll go to temperance but remember that word knowledge also meant discernment now discernment means the ability to pick right from wrong so so you're discerning even even at home life even here anywhere you're every day you're discerning between what whether you should do this or shouldn't do this or whether this is right or this is wrong or whether i should see this or shouldn't see this amen all right a lot of that's a lot of that's human knowledge but remember discernment brother brown said to say to see whether the word's right or not amen listen the bible says for sake father mother sister brother and follow me now how many of us do that well my sister's sick or my brother's sick or my cat's dog died and you don't show up for church it's an overcoming right that's how silly some of the excuses are excuses excuses but discernment is required of a christian it's not a it's not a it's a requirement that's why knowledge is a requirement because it's required for you to discern you know what discernment's going to do it's going to put you down the right path or the wrong path and i'm not talking whether going backwards i'm talking about in your new birth the discernment if it's required of you it's going to run you down here how many of you went to another church and you decided or discerned that that wasn't where you needed to be amen so what did what did your discernment do see you had discernment then you discerned that something else was better than what you had over here all right and discernment also comes to the word wisdom wisdom is the ability to think and act using knowledge because wisdom requires that you know something about something you can't have wisdom like i said about electricity and not have knowledge of it and not have participated in a class or either learned by a journeyman or trade or something somebody showed you see so there's wisdom the ability to think and act using knowledge experience understanding common sense and that last word we use we we ended up last sunday with insight that word insight is is you can put it right there with knowledge all right and look at what brother brown said the last the quote number seven and then we'll get into the temperance just for a minute and uh and speak of it temperance and patience maybe a little bit later on quote number seven all right god manifesting his gift oh i may stop here just a minute that i believe these nations are getting their last mercy call i believe i'm a record on tape by saying it but i believe it with all my heart that there's not a person on earth who could ever shake this thing back to its condition again so we forget about that all right we're not trying to reform the world right this statue of a perfect man is trying to transform nominal or our baby christians into full-fledged adults all right and an adult took a body change the baby didn't the man christ jesus not the baby it'll take the move of god the second coming of jesus christ so the only thing that's going to ever shake or move this thing is the second coming of jesus christ all right look at the indifference in the people today look how unconcerned they are you even see it in the christian in the christian world i talking to a guy the other day that's a um a baptist and and i think they're just i think they're done with what the denomination the world's doing to them or for them nothing there's nothing there's nothing for them out there but now remember that's why i made that statement the other sunday the foolish virgin in the bible come to the wise virgin why were they looking for oil why weren't they satisfied where they had been all them years they felt a pull they felt somebody that's come all the way up this statue of a perfect man i'm talking about one person i'm talking about a group that has come to a place that where god they feel the pull of god and they think well hey i want some of that i want some of that so i'm going to come and get i know where to go get it from those foolish virgins didn't wander around in the wilderness they came right to the wise virgin and said give us some of your oil what's oil the holy ghost give us some of that where we we you know and a lot of them are in justification a lot of them are in sanctification they re they live a good sanctified life but they just have nobody to take them on to the new birth all right but look at the indifference in the people today look how unconcerned they are eating drinking marrying giving in marriage just as it was predicted having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof the bible said from such turn away very religious he didn't say very christian he's a very religious they've always been religious but not having the spiritual insight to understand right that's the main thing right that's the thing that designates your eternal destination is your spiritual conception i like that right amen your spiritual conception of what of what you're hearing right all right let's go to the next one you recall that i mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying which is the bible is the actual revelation of jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages that's what brother dale's been reading in revelations 1 then i mentioned that it takes the holy spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study right that's right i get i get onto the sunday school class downstairs a lot when we do responsive reading they read it like reading a newspaper a comma means you got to pause think about something right all these all these um a period stop instead of just reading it like a newspaper i've stopped them several times haven't i hey man i've stopped him many times i said we got we reading it like a newspaper you're not reading it to be you're reading it just to get through you heard people that goes through the motions just to get through school and the teachers didn't like them so much they graduated them well i wasn't one of those but there's a brother of mine that he made it thank you it's always the middle child always that means that means this book can't be revealed look it's going to take the operation of the holy ghost all right that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people right what believers that's right that you believe that's where you're going to get it from right now all right it will take one with prophetic insight right our prophetic knowledge all right it will require the ability to hear from god it will require supernatural instruction not just a student it's what i'm saying not just a pseudonym comparing verse reverse because if you compare verse to verse you've got matthew 28 19 acts 2 38 you've got several here that look like they're contradictory but they're not but they look contradicted to dick contradictory to an untrained eye but once you see the revelation it will require spiritual instruction that matthew 28 19 says the same things acts 2 38 says all right same thing there's no deviation it's the same thing all right but it's just hidden from the wise and prudent not just the student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from god and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know and that word no is part of what knowledge knowledge all right it's the ability to know all right is everybody okay with knowledge so it's got to be discerned it's got to you got to have wisdom and wisdom comes from that because you know what without discernment how good is your wisdom i mean how good is it if you can't just you got to discern first before you become wise all right and then you know what then somebody can draw from that it's like brother brown said like brother dale said several times he you know i and sure i feel sorry for um rookie doctors but you always got to have there's always you got to have your first operation sometime but i would like to have one that had some experience operate on me but somebody's got to be the practitioner or the one to practice but i would like to have somebody with what wisdom that's been that's been through that that's opened that chest up and seen that heart before all right because that's me you're dealing with right so i want somebody with some wisdom and some discernment and some knowledge that's human knowledge but what about the same way with god how are we going to draw strength and knowledge from somebody you know that doesn't know the word of god you know you just can't there's no way you can do that uh you know i made the the statement the other day about june's dad he's just a wealth of knowledge as far as a businessman but as far as knowing god he doesn't so i can't draw strength from that i can't go over there and draw strength from god for that but now i can go draw strength of a business mind which that's fine you got to do that every day that's the same way with discernment you got to i mean how would you how would it be that like say if you go to somebody and you say well this guy's going to teach us how to become successful and you say well okay who is it he said well his name's you know bill jones bill jones bill jones has been bankrupt 14 times yeah and he's bankrupt now how's he going to teach us anything so all right so how we're going to draw virtue see the virtue's not there so definitely the knowledge is not there right see how these virtues work together the virtue of me wanting to pay to go hear this guy right i ain't gonna do it right because i'm discerning that that guy if he's in 14 bankruptcies he ain't somebody i want to hear about once maybe he wants to tell us things not to do but not things to do right so that's the same way with knowledge in god you want to come to this service wherever you go and you want to believe that god's going to reveal something to you it doesn't matter who's speaking doesn't matter if it's brother collie reading the reading the responsive reading or brother dick singing you know the right song and you know what i mean to get you in an atmosphere it's god through the whole thing trying to get you to see brother you know brother richard brother boy and all those you know the song leaders set that atmosphere but that's the way it is with god so now we see that it must take prophetic insight all right now let's go to the next one this one is temperance and it's not brother brown said we'll read it he said it's not it's not to quit drinking and all that stuff right that goes out right here so don't think this right there right it goes out right here right and it don't go no further if you're still drinking some lord jesus i hope nobody is but if you're still doing that you're not even in the body yet right let's just let's just let the rubber hit the road where it is if you're still cussing if you're still doing the things of the world don't worry about this you ain't got that yet you definitely ain't got that or that or that so let's just start you know i wish to god like brother dale said i wish we all could say lord jesus i'm right here okay that's good at least you realized it right jesus couldn't get the pharisees to see that they were right there exactly if he could get them to see that they'd went to the upper room and got that right but they didn't see it all right because of their what their choice they leaned on their own understanding of that old testament we have moses quote book well you know what moses's quote book killed them moses quote but just like brother brown's quote but will kill you if it's not revealed amen the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life all right so now let's look we come through virtue faith knowledge faith now let's come to temperance faith now look what is temperance we'll define it in a minute but i want you to the lord showed me this because when you say well i got to control my temper i got to control my temper well what where's that word control look at the word control so let's take hold that right there but listen to me it says self-control but it becomes not just temperance faith it becomes a controlled faith because a lot of times our human emotion comes above that controlled faith you know who had you know the the i'll read it in a minute the greatest uh definition or um illustration of controlled faith was when jesus was on the boat of sleep remember jesus was asleep on the boat the disciples were up and storm came he was asleep he had to be woke up but once he was woke up the first thing he didn't do he didn't start looking at circumstances he didn't start looking at well can i do this the bible said he just turned stepped on the bow of the boat and said peace be still right that's controlled faith that's a faith under control because those guys that were in the boat definitely were not under control remember they were shouting how can you sleep when all this is going on well he was tired but look self-control the virtue of one who masters his desires and passions especially his sensual appetite you show all that sexual no anything your senses lean toward passions and desires self-control all right especially his sensual appetite which we used to use a lot in other things but remember we must turn this temperance to a controlled faith because what you got to do is watch this you got to say i believe i can you see what i'm talking about we come through life thinking we can i think jesus didn't think right jesus stepped upon that boat and he knew if he said what he said that the the wind and the waves had to obey what he said that was a controlled faith that was i can get up and do this because i believe i can do it right now look this is not and i i've kind of felt this last sunday and i hadn't felt it this sunday but this is not mind over matter this is not just this is not well we got to have temperance i gotta healthy self no listen it's something i'll read it to you in a minute what brother brown said about but it's something that you live out automatically automatically because you know what's going to happen god's going gonna put something in your way one day and you're gonna know whether you got it or not because it's gonna be the first thing that pops out of your mouth or your head or your desire and you're gonna say lord that was me that was not you doing it that was me doing it and so now i know then i need to have more temperance or self-control now there are things that we can do like brother madam said he said that if you're stingy what do you say do the vice versa give money away right that sounds you know that sounds too simple but it's the truth if do the vice versa same thing with self-control self-control comes from where it just tells you self self is where that control comes from it comes from you and it's look it's not listen it means that you're in control of any situation tell me one time when jesus was out of control in any situation and we're that's that's his that's his temperance right right tell me when he was in when he was out of control he said well he blatted the ropes and they went out of control he knew what he was doing it was not blind jesus never had blind anger you and i sometimes have white blind anger amen then whose is it it's yours it's not god's so i said temperance is temperance is pretty tough i told them downstairs temperance and patience really goes close together remember we'll read it in a little bit we'll read it this afternoon that by the trying of your faith produces patience and it also produces temperance because how are you going to know you got a temper unless somebody pushes the button yeah that's right brother you need to do that first because it's a hot button but look self-control go back to jesus in what he did now let's go to mark 4 and we'll read that mark 4 verse 35 but it's self-control brother brown says you know bathe my soul with self-control you know the same day when even was come he saying let us pass over the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there was also with him other little ships so it wasn't just one ship a bunch of ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the higher part of the ship asleep on a pillar now how the world could somebody sleep during that but he was they awake him and said unto him master carest thou not that we perish they throwed it every bit on him cares not that we perish now look there's ryder lost mine not up on the boat i lost it right there i said what do you mean can y'all not handle these boats and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what matter of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey him that's control and we do we lean on temper but look at that temperance as even any situation you don't have to get your dander up to be in control right watch brother branham he was in control all the time jesus all them demons watched people fleeing and running and brother branham i was reading it the other day where the maniac came to him all the preachers on the pulpit he said run off left well they surely didn't have control but brother brown stood there and he said something come from inside he said you fall at my feet right it wasn't it wasn't that man because he knew that man could knock him off there he knew the man had the ability but remember he had that controlled faith that's what i said about many things you you look at and i don't i don't disagree with preachers doing what they do but they try to build your faith up by shaking your or talking loud or jesus never did that brother branham never did that and i don't see why we should have to do that a controlled faith that demon can't have a control over you if you don't let him now if you already got one and you're talking to a demon you're in trouble remember the seven sons of escheva what happened paul we know in other words paul we feel there's something different about that man jesus we know but who are you nothing to ring nothing no control in it nothing so what happened those demons what their power overtook any power that those seven sons had same way with you and i it's like brother dale's always said you don't deal with demons either right jesus never dealt with a demon he said come out that's all he said he didn't scream at him said come out well that's to me that's controlled faith that's a controlled faith there was a control faith and there was one i want to bring it's kind of a little bit funny but some of y'all don't know him but me and dad and terence know knew of a man named coy kate a man named coy kate he come up about daddy's age and the guy could throw a baseball through those two double doors right i mean he was well known but you know what one thing his problem was he could not control his temper right he could have pitched into major leagues had he not control and i'm telling you this as an analogy but he had the power he had the power to strike out the batters but if you were to taunt him or poke fun at him he became so blindly mad till that ball didn't go across a plate it went across your forehead right so he had the power he had the ability but he didn't have the self-control to control his emotions when those things happen to him same thing with you and i be even being christians we have the power but sometimes we get muddled up in all the things of the world or whatever we get you know we get to thinking about things and and jesus said right here what's the first thing why are you so fearful right why are you fearing these things what what's the deal with this why do you have no faith what he was saying was to him he says you ain't got no faith that's what he's saying he said how is it that you have no faith he's asking him but you know what they never answered him because they didn't have nothing to answer him with now buddy on the day of pentecost put peter in that situation again i believe peter would have been the first one to stand up on the boat and say peace be still right i just believe that because he had the power plus he had the virtues working in his life like brother and i were talking another day this is not something that brother branham
