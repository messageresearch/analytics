[29:26] turn about turning your Bibles to back
[29:29] to Corinthians we're going to finish up
[29:30] with extra today I've enjoyed it more
[29:35] this time I guess then time before
[29:37] somebody mentioned the other days that
[29:38] well you brought out a lot more than it
[29:39] did before I hope that there's more
[29:42] being brought out every time my brother
[29:44] Dale has been over about five different
[29:46] subjects 20 different times but you get
[29:48] something new every time so then you
[29:52] know what that does that doesn't make it
[29:53] old that doesn't make a stale that
[29:55] doesn't make it mundane that makes it a
[29:57] revelation that you go I didn't see them
[30:01] so you get that I believe that's God
[30:06] telling you you're on the right path if
[30:09] you get something and it helps you in
[30:13] your life and helps you in your
[30:14] spiritual walk then then that's God
[30:16] showing you till that gives you that
[30:19] little spiritual boost just like it
[30:20] would a good food or some vitamins or a
[30:22] good drink of water after working for a
[30:25] long period of time it's just kind of
[30:26] rejuvenation and it makes you stronger
[30:29] so we want to be stronger Christians
[30:31] absolutely amen
[30:33] so god bless you like I said before
[30:35] everything's back to normal
[30:37] but as normal as it can be so we're

[30:42] still gonna make sure if you're coughing

[31:01] listen there's not a lot of joy out
[31:02] there it's just people beating each
[31:06] other killing each other shooting each
[31:08] other and don't know what to do and it's
[31:12] just not bothered me
[31:14] you know I mean you don't it shouldn't
[31:17] bother a Christian it should tell us
[31:19] that we have now these markers that we
[31:21] as we spoke years ago about these
[31:23] markers of different dates we see that
[31:25] if you would pray you next Sunday
[31:28] probably if I get finished today
[31:30] next Sunday we're gonna start on the
[31:32] feast days in the Bible all right but
[31:36] remember this those are what those are
[31:40] for our example like we're gonna read
[31:42] here we don't we don't take two weeks
[31:45] off or one week off for the Feast of
[31:47] Tabernacles we don't take you understand
[31:49] one of them we're not Jewish to that
[31:51] degree maybe we should
[31:53] so both got three coming up pretty quick
[31:55] here in September so um but anyway I'm
[31:58] just I'm just kidding but we are
[32:00] spiritually God gave that feast and
[32:03] every application of that for me and you
[32:10] the killing of the animals the washing
[32:13] of this the eating of the unleavened
[32:15] bread sure that was something they had
[32:17] to go by that was works but see by grace
[32:21] were saved through faith as brother Dale
[32:23] was talking about so we look at these
[32:24] things and we see that we there's a
[32:26] spiritual application and I want you to
[32:28] be praying about this and remember this
[32:33] is the importance that I'm gonna put on
[32:35] it is that the feast days were to Israel
[32:41] there was four in the spring and three
[32:45] in the fall everybody got that
[32:47] those of you Bible readers you know that
[32:49] there was four in the spring and three
[32:52] in the fall all right there was Passover
[32:54] unleavened bread firstfruits and the
[32:56] feast of Pentecost then you had a long
[32:58] period of time and this year on May the
[33:01] 31st was the feast of Pentecost and it
[33:04] was on a Sunday all right so now we've
[33:07] got now coming up you've got the Feast
[33:09] of Trumpets which is September the 19th
[33:13] what day is I September nineteen
[33:15] Tennessee birthday a little mercy we'll
[33:17] hear about that nevermind Davis Day of
[33:20] Atonement September the 28th and the
[33:22] Feast of Tabernacles will be October the
[33:25] 2nd through the night so we got those
[33:26] Springs I mean those fall fee
[33:28] coming up and remember one thing Jesus
[33:32] this is I want what you didn't want you
[33:34] to mull this around your head Jesus
[33:37] fulfilled the first four he was killed
[33:42] on Passover he was part of the
[33:44] unleavened bread he stayed in the grave
[33:46] he was the firstfruits that came up out
[33:49] of the grave and obviously he was the
[33:52] big deal on the feast of Pentecost
[33:54] because on that very day he came back
[33:57] into the people but now you've got this
[33:59] long period of time that Jesus is not
[34:01] only earth but he's in his people so the
[34:06] Feast of Tabernacles
[34:07] the Feast of Trumpets the feast the Day
[34:11] of Atonement and Feast of Tabernacles
[34:12] you and I have to fulfill and Christ
[34:16] does it through us in these fall feasts
[34:20] that's why I love the fall of the year
[34:21] being that it is a time of harvest all
[34:26] right so god bless you let's pray just
[34:29] keep those things in your heart we're
[34:31] coming up on a time that we're gonna go
[34:37] home we're getting out of here they can
[34:40] have this world they have whatever but
[34:42] you know what we're gonna see just in a
[34:44] minute how that the king gave Esther all
[34:48] of Haman's property when the devil is
[34:53] destroyed he's gonna give us all the
[34:56] devil's property you say oh yeah yeah
[34:58] cuz remember
[34:59] this is he's a squatter and he's on
[35:03] squatter but when this thing becomes God
[35:07] on the outside the devil's been
[35:10] destroyed and we have retook our
[35:13] possession and he's not a squad rennie
[35:15] more so this is what we're looking at
[35:17] today but we're gonna start I'm gonna
[35:19] comment on Esther chapter five just for
[35:21] a minute then we're going to go back to
[35:22] Esther chapter eight let's bow our heads
[35:25] the only father we thank you for the
[35:26] word Lord that you give us we pray now
[35:29] that you're sanctified Lord in the
[35:31] speaking and in the hearing Lord that
[35:34] we'll take today Lord and ponder these
[35:37] things in our heart is many have have
[35:39] done over the centuries of time they've
[35:42] listen to sermons they've listened to
[35:44] many things Lord but now we've come to
[35:46] the end where we're we're at a position
[35:50] Lord where the sermons are getting
[35:52] smaller and smaller we're heading toward
[35:54] that end time to where we're going to
[35:57] have a joyous feast and we're going to
[36:00] be able to step over into eternity and
[36:02] father will be there Lord with you like
[36:06] you've always wanted but Lord we've got
[36:09] a journey now that we've got to continue
[36:10] in as Esther did and as the different
[36:12] ones of Abram to Abraham and Sarah -
[36:16] Sarah and Ruth all the way through to
[36:19] having the promised son lord I pray that
[36:21] you just be with us Lord take care of us
[36:23] at the church be with our pastor bless
[36:25] him Lord keep him strong keep us all
[36:27] safe and be with us Lord in the further
[36:30] 'men of this service blessed Lord the
[36:31] missionaries on the foreign fields we
[36:33] see now there's not many out there
[36:35] because of this virus thing Lord you
[36:37] there's there's a lot of people having
[36:40] to do on their own which is which that's
[36:41] the way it should be
[36:42] Lord we should get this thing as an
[36:44] individual affair with you Lord and then
[36:46] you will speak to us you promised you
[36:48] would father we pray that you'd bless us
[36:50] now take care of us in Jesus name Amen
[36:53] yeah you there's just not a lot of
[36:56] movement going on and in the foreign
[36:58] fields because nobody can get over there
[37:00] but you know what
[37:02] God knew it he already sent him some he
[37:06] already sent him some information he
[37:08] given the internet he gave them live
[37:10] streaming and all these different things
[37:11] so I'm not worried about the true bride
[37:14] the true bride we'll make it through I
[37:16] said the true bride now remember because
[37:19] Israel's not all Israel and every person
[37:21] that came up on the feast of Passover
[37:24] and through the lamb up on the upon the
[37:27] altar didn't get their sins forgiven
[37:29] because guarding you the heart but now
[37:32] some people did and I believe they did
[37:34] it humble and they did it crying and
[37:36] confessing their sins just like you and
[37:37] I and they got their sins forgiven on
[37:40] the day of Passover when they killed the
[37:42] lamb so god bless you let's just read
[37:43] the last one verse 11 now all these
[37:46] things happened unto them for examples
[37:48] and they are written for our admonition
[37:49] upon whom the ends of the world are come
[37:53] you may be seated in the Laurinaitis
[37:54] blessing
[37:56] to the reading of the word but here in
[37:59] the book of Esther we see that extra
[38:02] starts as a nothing little girl and now
[38:05] Esther's leaving the building
[38:09] bad timing start talking about him and
[38:14] they walk out the door she won't be back
[38:17] for a while to get her face from being
[38:23] super here but you get up and start
[38:26] talking by the Esther and then she get
[38:27] some walks out the door but this little
[38:29] girl started from nothing and now she's
[38:33] a queen now she has a little bit of pull
[38:38] with the King why because in Chapter
[38:42] five
[38:43] Esther comes to a place to where Astra
[38:46] knows if she doesn't go into the king
[38:48] that her people are gonna perish amen
[38:51] and listen as we were talking downstairs
[38:55] this morning revelations chapter one
[38:59] through three shows the bride of Jesus
[39:01] Christ on earth and anybody listen to
[39:05] this I want you to get this anyone from
[39:08] that day of Pentecost on the fiftieth
[39:11] day after the after the Passover on the
[39:15] fiftieth day there was a feast of
[39:17] Pentecost and Jesus Christ actually came
[39:21] back into the believers now from that
[39:23] point forward every person get this
[39:26] that's why the bride is so important
[39:31] Jesus is not on the scene right Jesus is
[39:34] not physically here but on the day of
[39:37] Pentecost he comes into a hundred and
[39:39] twenty people burst them into the body
[39:43] makes them the bride and everything
[39:48] after that that's going to make it to
[39:51] heaven
[39:51] whether it be bride whether it be
[39:55] foolish virgin whether it be cup of
[39:58] water in my name has all got to come
[40:01] from that
[40:05] think about that revelations one through
[40:09] three is talking about the bride on the
[40:14] earth her character oh yeah she messes
[40:18] up every once in a while but everything
[40:21] for two thousand years since Jesus died
[40:24] and came back on the day of Pentecost
[40:26] everything has been about the bride
[40:29] that's how important you are that's how
[40:32] important and then the more the more
[40:35] important it is we're the only ones left
[40:37] alive
[40:39] everybody else is in another dimension
[40:41] there's the first a second third fourth
[40:43] fifth most of the seventh it's already
[40:46] in that sixth dimension waiting on a
[40:48] group of people not waiting all the
[40:51] denomination's not waiting on the Pope
[40:54] not waiting on politics but waiting on
[40:58] menu that's how important Esther was
[41:04] Esther said if I die I die but I'm going
[41:08] in to the king because I've got some
[41:10] people I got some people there are left
[41:17] out here then I need to get in I need
[41:21] for them to at least be able to defend
[41:24] their self because they had no hope
[41:27] without Esther
[41:29] read your Bible they had no hope because
[41:33] he had already Haman had already made
[41:36] his Proclamation the King had already
[41:38] signed it we're going to see here in
[41:40] just a minute that the King made a
[41:42] decree and couldn't take it back you
[41:45] know we're going to see here in just a
[41:46] minute God made a decree and couldn't
[41:48] take it back in Genesis in Genesis 3 he
[41:50] said because of what you've done
[41:54] death will take you to the ground ashes
[41:59] to ashes dust to dust
[42:01] in other words God said there's nothing
[42:04] I can do about what I said because in
[42:06] Genesis 3 all that when the fall
[42:08] happened God couldn't go back he said
[42:13] the day you eat thereof that day you die
[42:15] that's the same way wasn't when hey
[42:18] got the King to write the decree to kill
[42:22] the Jews which he didn't know who it was
[42:23] in there in the natural story they were
[42:27] just gonna die there was going to be a
[42:30] day when this king with this great army
[42:32] he didn't have like two people he had
[42:35] like two million people in the army all
[42:37] over the country they were just going to
[42:39] go in and kill all the Jews same way was
[42:42] saying don't you think Satan under that
[42:44] Pentecost he's trying to figure out what
[42:45] yep I got a 120 to deal with now huh and
[42:50] now I got more to deal with and now I
[42:52] got more to deal with and now he's in
[42:53] the end time going I'll get him he's
[42:57] persistent he's been waiting 2000 years
[43:00] he said I'll get them and then the
[43:01] Lord's going hang on a minute because I
[43:05] have made a provision we're going to
[43:09] read it here but what happens in chapter
[43:11] 5 is she tells him she brings Haman in
[43:16] and Haman remember we were talking about
[43:17] last Sunday Haman comes in and Haman is
[43:21] pre-select guy but whatever Haman did
[43:25] the King turned it right around same way
[43:32] with God God's gonna say alright devil
[43:33] you caused all this I mean you you you
[43:35] you're the one that went into the garden
[43:37] and you're the one that that made this
[43:39] but it didn't mess my plan up I knew you
[43:43] were gonna do that
[43:44] the day I made you I knew you were gonna
[43:46] do that
[43:47] I knew you were gonna make you fall I
[43:50] knew you were gonna do all this and I
[43:52] knew that death was gonna rain for 2,000
[43:56] years and God's just hanging on he's
[44:00] just waiting but there's somebody got to
[44:03] come up like Esther because watch here
[44:05] in just a minute when we get into
[44:06] chapter 8 she devises a plan because she
[44:14] knows one thing for sure she's already
[44:16] made the petition we know one thing's
[44:18] for sure that that there in Chapter
[44:20] seven that at that banquet that Haman
[44:23] was destroyed and hung on his own gala
[44:26] he made the gal oh he was gonna hang
[44:29] Mordecai on it
[44:30] all right and he thought for a moment he
[44:34] was gonna be the pace she's back now we
[44:37] can talk about her again she's good
[44:39] okay you face it they're red
[44:42] so Heyman says man you know I'm gonna
[44:46] make my own bride I'm gonna be my own
[44:49] man I'm gonna ban I'm gonna make God
[44:52] happy
[44:54] hmm so the king says who's worthy to
[45:01] wear my crown and wear my jewels and put
[45:04] him on a horse and he says all while the
[45:06] great man that that you know got you out
[45:09] of trouble and all this stuff and and
[45:11] the devil's going I got you buddy
[45:14] you're just nice right where you're at
[45:16] aren't you comfortable but that day the
[45:23] exact black got borning in Heyman had to
[45:29] put him on the horse and put the crown
[45:34] on his head and the Royal jewels on his
[45:37] finger and had to parade him through the
[45:40] crowd and he liked it did he so he
[45:45] started again but we know the devil he
[45:48] does have an end but in that wonderful
[45:51] though however and listen everything my
[45:53] brother Dale said this morning even your
[45:55] sickness we don't want to glorify the
[45:58] devil and God doesn't just throw things
[46:01] on you on purpose he knows what you need
[46:04] when you need it
[46:06] amen so he puts a little something he
[46:10] moves you over you know there's some
[46:12] things going on in in my life and my
[46:15] body not my life but my body that I'm
[46:18] having to deal with some things but you
[46:20] know why it's gonna do it's gonna make
[46:22] it to where I'm not looking this way
[46:25] anymore hey you know it's none of your
[46:30] business whatever it is but I'm telling
[46:31] you how what does God do to you same
[46:33] thing you think I'm good no that's not
[46:39] good let me go this way but that's the
[46:41] way it is with God but you listen you
[46:43] pay a 10
[46:45] - what he's saying to you because he's
[46:47] the one remember God's nose or the best
[46:50] yes you ever get because you ask
[46:52] something you ask something even brother
[46:54] Brown said you can press right brother
[46:58] Brown said I can press God and get what
[46:59] I want but it would be permissive will
[47:01] and there might be a problem but the
[47:03] perfect will of God is when he says no
[47:05] you just go okay I thought that was
[47:08] right you know what God says that's what
[47:11] you get for thinking he said let me do
[47:14] the thinking because remember this
[47:17] knowledge right here is not the
[47:18] knowledge of man it's the knowledge of
[47:21] God so we see this in extras life she's
[47:25] using sure in the story she's using
[47:28] regular knowledge but don't you think
[47:30] one thing's for sure if she's given to
[47:33] us just like Abraham's just like Abraham
[47:35] just like Ruth they were guided by God
[47:39] because if their life didn't turn out
[47:41] that way God couldn't wrote it in the
[47:43] Bible so that me and you can go down the
[47:46] right path so that me and you could do
[47:49] the right thing when something happens
[47:51] in your life you have adversity in your
[47:53] life and you have something going on you
[47:55] say well that happened to Ruth well that
[47:58] happened to Esther and you see what they
[48:01] did to overcome it because here's Esther
[48:04] she comes and makes that petition and
[48:06] the King says sorry I've wrote what I
[48:12] wrote the day you eat thereof that day
[48:19] you die I cannot take that back because
[48:22] I'm a judge and I'm a righteous judge
[48:25] and I judge sin and you send in Genesis
[48:30] 3 and we were born in sin shaping the
[48:34] iniquity nothing we can do about that
[48:37] you cannot reverse your first birth
[48:40] remember what we remember what Nicodemus
[48:43] nickname was like would I need to go
[48:44] rule did I need to reverse my first
[48:46] birth Jesus said mm-hmm that's the one
[48:50] that's killing you you need to be born
[48:52] from above in other words you need to
[48:54] have a way out
[48:57] so where's the way out jesus said I am
[49:01] the way the truth and the life the King
[49:06] had to come on the scene and the King
[49:08] couldn't change his word but he used it
[49:12] to kill the devil and he used it to save
[49:16] you just like we're gonna see right here
[49:18] in Chapter eight so let's go to chapter
[49:21] eight and let's begin right here now
[49:27] remember this is right after Haman was
[49:28] hung on the gallows that he had made
[49:31] listen Satan is going to be hung by his
[49:34] own word by your words you shall be
[49:40] justified by your words you shall be
[49:42] condemned
[49:42] alright Chapter eight here we are in
[49:45] Chapter eight does eight have any okay
[49:49] we don't see the devil after Chapter
[49:52] eight we're after Chapter seven because
[49:55] when you're in eternity
[49:56] the devil is not there remember that and
[50:00] get this that's why you don't see the
[50:02] devil he's not eternal and he can't
[50:05] become eternal because he's already made
[50:07] his choice and he's already shut itself
[50:09] off because of iniquity I was terrible
[50:11] we were talking about downstairs you
[50:13] know Satan was made perfect God can't
[50:17] make anything imperfect he can't make
[50:20] the devil be evil but the devil in his
[50:23] own choosing chose to be that way he
[50:26] wanted her what a higher place and
[50:28] listen that's what Haman wanted Haman
[50:31] just didn't want to get rid of Mordecai
[50:33] people this is that I mean that's the
[50:34] story Haman just didn't want to get rid
[50:37] of Mordecai but Mordecai was the one
[50:39] standing in his way so he could sit on
[50:42] that throne or be the total right-hand
[50:46] man that's why he had to get rid of
[50:47] Mordecai but we see that he didn't so
[50:54] chapter eight let's begin reading around
[50:56] here on that day did the king of source
[51:00] give the house of Haman the Jews enemy
[51:03] under Esther the Queen what the Bible
[51:07] tell us were
[51:09] airs enjoin airs we are priests and
[51:13] kings remember there is a quote brother
[51:16] that was this morning you have to rip be
[51:18] careful there is quotes where brother
[51:20] branham would say something you go man
[51:22] and then he make another quote because
[51:24] brother Brown will say Satan is the air
[51:26] of the earth well he's really not he's a
[51:28] squatter cuz brother Brown comes over
[51:30] and he says no he's a squatter he's just
[51:33] there squatting on your land so he's a
[51:37] squatter so what has he done the King
[51:42] gives everything because remember where
[51:45] we gonna rule and reign and what are we
[51:48] gonna rule it right over this earth is
[51:51] ours it was Adams to begin with
[51:56] remember God said I'll take care of the
[51:58] heaven you take care of the earth Hanna
[51:59] well the second Adam come back to give
[52:02] us control and to give us back our
[52:06] possession but he's gotta save this
[52:09] earth first then when this earth gets
[52:12] saved it'll go right straight over like
[52:15] we were talking about this morning we'll
[52:16] just step over it'll just be like that
[52:19] Kikaider
[52:19] you'll look one day and you'll say man
[52:24] I'm new Abraham woke up one morning he
[52:29] said we're that old guy go there was a
[52:34] question this morning whether that would
[52:36] be a gradual process I don't believe so
[52:37] the Bible says will be changed in the
[52:39] moment in the twinkling of an eye you
[52:43] know you get something in your eye
[52:44] you really don't miss a lot but by that
[52:48] time you do that then everybody's
[52:50] changed and that's the way God is but he
[52:54] turns around and gives everything that
[52:56] Haman had to ask to the Queen they
[53:00] didn't give it to Mordecai because
[53:02] Mordecai's got a position if Mordecai is
[53:06] our little man our prophet of the hour
[53:09] okay God can't give all the promises to
[53:13] one man it's his bride first now we know
[53:18] brother listen we know brother Brown was
[53:20] part of the bride so he gets it too but
[53:22] he's not
[53:23] but God just didn't say all right I'm
[53:24] giving it all the way in Brenham and
[53:25] then he's nowhere to be seen because
[53:27] he's gone off the scene and here we are
[53:30] with nothing no that's not the way God
[53:32] works that's not the way any story in
[53:35] the Bible begins our ends with giving it
[53:39] to one man he's giving it to what yeah
[53:41] he's giving it to asked her but after
[53:42] tops the bride he's giving it to John on
[53:44] the Isle of Patmos who does John top the
[53:47] entire bride me and you when I say bride
[53:51] you should say me so he gave all the
[53:55] possessions of Haman to Esther the Queen
[53:59] and Mordecai came before the king for
[54:02] Esther had told what he was unto her
[54:05] amen so we got we got to put this little
[54:09] man back in here because he's he's
[54:11] oneness he's a little bit smarter than
[54:13] Esther okay at the time because he's out
[54:18] here Esther's in the court he's out here
[54:20] watching the world profit profit
[54:25] prophetic he hears all these different
[54:28] things that's going on he hears the two
[54:30] men he just happens to be in the right
[54:32] place when the two murderers are getting
[54:34] ready no he's in a position like brother
[54:38] Branham was standing he said okay I'm
[54:40] going to cause I'm gonna send my profit
[54:41] across the curtain of time brother
[54:42] Branham goes across the curtain of time
[54:44] he comes back tells who us what to look
[54:46] for all the different things in his life
[54:49] he's telling it as an example never
[54:52] pointing his finger to itself but to a
[54:55] bride and that's more to cause
[54:59] Commission Mordecai didn't walk up and
[55:01] say now kid wait a minute
[55:02] you give Esther all that house to Haman
[55:04] and I'm the one who told you to he's not
[55:07] that way that's not the character that
[55:08] man that wasn't a character William man
[55:11] Branham either but watch the King took
[55:21] off his ring which he had taken from
[55:23] Haman and he didn't give it to Esther he
[55:29] gave it to Mordecai
[55:31] why did he give it to Mordecai Mordecai
[55:33] was one that had like I said before had
[55:35] the knowledge
[55:36] of the prophecy he was outside he was
[55:39] watching everything that was going on so
[55:42] the king you say what is that brother
[55:45] way brother Brown came to adoption
[55:47] before anybody else death oh that's your
[55:49] signet right
[55:50] we know Esther had power with the King
[55:53] because she she went into I mean she was
[55:57] part of them in the bed you understand
[55:59] what I mean the secret things were told
[56:01] to Esther but the secret things of the
[56:03] outside world brother Branham would go
[56:07] somewhere and he would come back and
[56:09] tell us these different things that were
[56:12] going on in the world he's telling her
[56:14] he told us 50 years ago what's happening
[56:16] now pretty much okay so that's what
[56:19] Mordecai yes he gave the Rings in other
[56:22] words he gives authority to brother
[56:24] Branham to tell us what to do and Esther
[56:31] set Mordecai over the house of Haman and
[56:33] Esther Speight yet again before the king
[56:35] now remember she'd already talked to him
[56:37] one time about reversing this thing he
[56:40] said I can't reverse it but watch what
[56:43] she does and Esther spate yet again
[56:45] before the king and fell down at his
[56:46] feet and besought him with tears to put
[56:49] away the mischief of Haman the a guy and
[56:51] his device that he had devised against
[56:54] the Jews how many of you know what the
[56:59] characteristic of having the baptism of
[57:02] the Holy Ghost is brother Brown said you
[57:04] cry and sigh you go to the king and make
[57:10] a petition because listen the only way
[57:13] some believe this the only way
[57:18] somebody's gonna get a new birth is if
[57:19] you tell them about it
[57:22] not some radio program you wife comes
[57:27] through the body of Christ that makes
[57:31] you important you know why cause God
[57:34] chose you to do that you didn't use
[57:37] yourself God chose you to do that
[57:39] the team sets you in place and nobody
[57:42] can take your place I broke my heart
[57:47] when you see that she'd be salt with
[57:50] tears to save my how many of us do that
[57:54] there's a wall right here below me full
[57:57] of names some of them has power some of
[58:02] them have not right here people we
[58:08] wanted it right here what was right
[58:10] underneath this pulpit if you don't know
[58:12] what I'm talking about going my Sunday
[58:14] School class and look at this wall of
[58:15] people your friends your family your
[58:17] husband's your wife your children your
[58:19] neighbors we put their names and some of
[58:22] them the pictures up so that we know
[58:24] personally who they are
[58:25] that's what extra was doing actually was
[58:27] saying King these people are gonna die
[58:30] my people are gonna die if you don't do
[58:33] something he says that King changed my
[58:35] word but watch what happens so the King
[58:41] held out the golden scepter toward after
[58:43] why he couldn't do anything he don't
[58:44] kill her he loves her so extra arose and
[58:48] stood before the king and said if it
[58:50] pleases the King now watch this this is
[58:55] Esther and I have found favor in his
[58:57] sight and the thing seems right before
[59:00] the King and I'll be pleasing in his
[59:03] eyes let it be written to reverse the
[59:07] letter devised by Haman the son of all
[59:09] that which he wrote to destroy the Jews
[59:12] which are in all the Kings promises for
[59:14] how can I endure to see the evil that
[59:16] still coming to my people in other words
[59:17] like I said before sigh and cry sigh and
[59:20] cry we need to sign cry for our people
[59:23] it's getting late how many of you went
[59:27] into the king and say King I need to
[59:29] talk to you for a minute yeah for how
[59:33] can I endure to see the evil they should
[59:34] coming to my people
[59:35] or how can I endure the see the
[59:37] destruction of my kindred now watch this
[59:42] then the king of source set into extra
[59:46] the Queen and two more to college you
[59:47] behold I have given s to the house of
[59:51] Haman and him they have hanged on the
[59:53] gallows because he laid his hands upon
[59:54] the Jews right you also for the Jews as
[59:59] it like us you in the King's name in you
[1:00:09] write it you write it I'll back it up
[1:00:19] right you also for the Jews as it like
[1:00:22] a--the you in the King's name and seal
[1:00:25] it with the King's ring for the writing
[1:00:30] which is written in the King's name and
[1:00:32] sealed with the King's ring may no man
[1:00:35] reverse listen there was nobody change
[1:00:43] sure it was laying all in the scripture
[1:00:46] it was laying in the Word of God but no
[1:00:51] one was able to preach it until Mordecai
[1:00:56] comes on this thing until our little
[1:00:59] profit that comes in and broke
[1:01:00] themselves open I don't understand how
[1:01:03] in the heavenly days nice thing about
[1:01:04] this other day how in the world where we
[1:01:07] gonna know what those seals were what
[1:01:08] the trumpets were what the vowels were
[1:01:10] what the what the all the different ones
[1:01:12] all the thunders are not we need
[1:01:15] somebody else to come if he were uh the
[1:01:16] Rams not the one when he needs to come
[1:01:19] in a hurry but we don't believe that you
[1:01:22] know that we believe he's already come
[1:01:24] our Mordecai's already cup wrote us
[1:01:26] eleven hundred and something letters put
[1:01:29] them in all different languages sent him
[1:01:31] all over the world yeah and put the king
[1:01:32] seal on it because when the sails were
[1:01:35] broke that was a king seal Rocchi also
[1:01:42] for the jews has it like it to you in
[1:01:43] the King's name and seal it with the
[1:01:46] king's ring for the writings which is
[1:01:48] written in the King
[1:01:49] named in other words look this book
[1:01:53] killed you sealed with seven seals
[1:02:01] remember they were scrolled rolled up
[1:02:03] sealed this thing kills you but what
[1:02:09] happened in 1963 the seals were broke
[1:02:17] and the true letter not that the other
[1:02:21] ones were false all they knew is what
[1:02:23] they knew
[1:02:23] but remember brother M said a what light
[1:02:26] shining on this yet the light that was
[1:02:29] shining on this came with a king seal I
[1:02:31] can't change this but I can write it in
[1:02:35] there in secret I can put that love
[1:02:37] letter in there where you can finally
[1:02:40] after Mordechai comes and gives you a
[1:02:42] little knowledge and by the Holy Ghost
[1:02:44] that we have now guess what I'm gonna
[1:02:49] give you a way to defend yourself
[1:02:50] I can't reverse what I said because
[1:02:56] listen he can't so reverse itself even
[1:03:04] in the Millenium because people go it's
[1:03:10] got to be a thousand years and then
[1:03:12] after that all the centers are gonna die
[1:03:15] you see what I'm saying so this thing
[1:03:17] continues on but not for us not for
[1:03:19] astronaut for Mordecai because there's
[1:03:21] something coming there's something
[1:03:23] that's been written then where the King
[1:03:27] scribes called at that time in the third
[1:03:30] month how about that
[1:03:33] that is the month Saban on the three and
[1:03:36] twentieth day thereof and it was written
[1:03:39] according to all that Mordechai preached
[1:03:49] to the Jews hey the Kings not writing
[1:03:54] this at the time he's writing it instead
[1:03:59] of in his stead don't remember he's got
[1:04:04] the authority Mordecai the Jew in other
[1:04:06] words more two kinds of Christian
[1:04:07] Esther's a Christian he knows how they
[1:04:10] act he knows what they need so what'd he
[1:04:12] do and it was written according to all
[1:04:14] that Mordecai commanded them to the Jews
[1:04:16] now look he can't reverse what the king
[1:04:18] said he can't write a new Bible but he
[1:04:22] can take what's already written in this
[1:04:24] Bible and help you defend yourself was
[1:04:30] written according to all that Mordecai
[1:04:31] commanders of the Jews and to the
[1:04:32] lieutenant's and the deputies and rulers
[1:04:34] of the provinces works from India to
[1:04:36] Ethiopia look that up on the map
[1:04:40] 127 provinces under every province
[1:04:42] according to the writing thereof and to
[1:04:45] other people after I had to write in
[1:04:46] different languages we had to get this
[1:04:49] message out in different languages and
[1:04:52] to the Jews according to their writing
[1:04:55] and according to their language and he
[1:04:58] wrote in the King a sources name and
[1:05:02] sealed it with the king's ring and sent
[1:05:06] messages all over the world my muse
[1:05:10] camos dromedaries tape players mp3 we're
[1:05:19] in the King granted the Jews which were
[1:05:24] in every city to congregate together
[1:05:30] where the carcass is there were the
[1:05:33] Eagles to be gathered
[1:05:35] wearing the King granted the Jews which
[1:05:37] were never seated together the self
[1:05:39] together and to stand that's what you're
[1:05:42] doing today brothers and sisters you're
[1:05:44] standing for your life I like Brett what
[1:05:48] brother when the ropes used to say ease
[1:05:49] as I rest my soul on Malakoff bow but
[1:05:56] not just the person Malka for not the
[1:05:57] Mordecai it's what he wrote remember
[1:06:00] and the power that was behind it because
[1:06:05] remember brother Brahma can't change the
[1:06:07] Bible but when he took that seal and put
[1:06:11] it on them eleven hundred something
[1:06:12] sermons and we get a revelation that
[1:06:14] that's how we're supposed to get it it
[1:06:16] don't change the Bible but it sure
[1:06:18] helped us defend ourselves hello every
[1:06:23] day you do that you defend yourself by
[1:06:25] the Word of God the devil says I got you
[1:06:28] you go like you don't know cuz you know
[1:06:33] what I had a Mordechai come and tell me
[1:06:36] he didn't have to tell me it was already
[1:06:39] written in the Bible then in the moment
[1:06:40] of twenty one I were gonna be changed
[1:06:42] but you know what he done he lined it up
[1:06:46] trumps you'll sound
[1:06:48] dead in Christ shall rise first we shall
[1:06:51] be changed and then we all gonna get out
[1:06:54] of here and we're gonna leave the Haman
[1:06:58] behind and we're gonna let him just do
[1:07:02] his business down here you think he's
[1:07:03] running now you where do we get out of
[1:07:05] here we're in the King granted the Jews
[1:07:08] which were never sitting together
[1:07:09] themselves together and to stand for
[1:07:11] their life watch this I like what
[1:07:14] brother Ernie says brother and he says
[1:07:16] how come black them if you don't have
[1:07:21] tea if you don't have teeth gum the
[1:07:23] devil to death because look what eat
[1:07:26] anyway look Jesus told us the kingdom of

[1:07:50] your life destroy to sway close to
[1:07:54] parish do you know who won his call he's
[1:07:56] calling down judgment hold his own
[1:07:59] people the king is gonna send this army
[1:08:05] anyway remember the Angels he sends the
[1:08:09] angels out got scripture for all this
[1:08:11] folk he sends the angels
[1:08:14] the Reapers and he tells them to cut
[1:08:16] everything down but separate the wheat
[1:08:19] from the tares what's he doing right
[1:08:23] here stand for your life to destroy the
[1:08:27] slate it comes to perish all the power
[1:08:30] of the people and the prominence that
[1:08:33] would assault them both little ones and
[1:08:37] women and to take the spot listen not
[1:08:41] only just to defend yourself that's good
[1:08:45] but you know what he's telling he's
[1:08:48] saying look take all the spoil with you
[1:08:52] take all the spoil with you for a prey
[1:08:58] upon one day and all the provinces of
[1:09:02] king of source namely upon the 13th day
[1:09:04] of the 12th month which is the month
[1:09:06] adar now remember just to jump forward
[1:09:10] that's called the day of Purim P you are
[1:09:13] M and they still celebrate it every year
[1:09:16] they celebrate what happened because
[1:09:19] they would have been wiped out don't
[1:09:22] worry about Egypt and all them different
[1:09:24] people Haman was gonna wipe them people
[1:09:27] off the face of the earth
[1:09:28] same way was Hitler I told you when
[1:09:30] Haman died that spirit just went over
[1:09:32] into another somebody and we saw that
[1:09:36] manifest right here in the forties when
[1:09:40] Hitler was getting ready to destroy the
[1:09:43] Jews amen but thank God even with that
[1:09:47] see even with that God put in there
[1:09:49] behind the Bible a fifth sealed you
[1:09:55] there's gonna be giving eternal life
[1:09:58] just because there's you upon one day
[1:10:03] and all the prophets of king of source
[1:10:04] namely upon the 13th day of the 12th
[1:10:05] month which is a month adar
[1:10:07] the copy of the writings for a
[1:10:10] commandment to be given in every
[1:10:12] province was published unto all the
[1:10:13] people and that the Jews should be ready
[1:10:16] against that day to avenge themselves he
[1:10:19] told them the very day it was coming
[1:10:23] hello somebody
[1:10:27] I'm coming today defend yourself
[1:10:32] today we call that Monday and the
[1:10:40] congregation says the ones that are
[1:10:44] retired never then seen every day is a
[1:10:49] Saturday to them but that's on Monday
[1:10:52] right really yes on Monday that's our
[1:10:56] trial and tribulation day we feel good
[1:10:59] it's good to be a Christian on Sunday
[1:11:01] but Monday hmm
[1:11:04] fight that thing but we had it published
[1:11:09] folks we had it written in our language
[1:11:12] to tell us that not just one day for us
[1:11:18] but the day of the Lord we are now in
[1:11:22] when you got born again you were entered
[1:11:24] in the day of the Lord not one 24-hour
[1:11:27] day you entered into the day of the Lord
[1:11:30] so that the post-event
[1:11:33] that the Jews should be ready against
[1:11:35] that day to avenge themselves from their
[1:11:37] enemies you know what if you got a
[1:11:38] problem open up the book read where you
[1:11:44] win and then listen to a couple of
[1:11:47] sermons where brother branham preaches
[1:11:49] on the rapture and the change in Abraham
[1:11:52] and like we've been talking about so the
[1:11:54] Post that wrote upon mules and camels
[1:11:56] went out being hastened and pressed on
[1:12:02] by the Kings commandment and the decree
[1:12:05] was given as Shushan the palace where
[1:12:11] did it go - you called me a mule if you
[1:12:14] want - I don't care but a fivefold
[1:12:18] ministry carries this message you can
[1:12:23] call me a camel I really don't care
[1:12:26] there's other things beside the donkey
[1:12:28] people call me but that's okay I really
[1:12:31] don't mind but this is the way you're
[1:12:33] gonna get it
[1:12:34] this is the way you're gonna get what
[1:12:36] this commandment is listen they didn't
[1:12:39] have email text messages they had human
[1:12:45] flesh that physically went out and said
[1:12:49] you need to tell your people that June
[1:12:52] whatever it is that day you're gonna
[1:12:55] have a fight you gotta be ready though
[1:13:00] now now brother is ready but what about
[1:13:03] some of us the rest of us are we ready
[1:13:06] for the day of the battle are we ready
[1:13:10] are we just going I really don't think
[1:13:12] that's gonna happen
[1:13:13] you think that's gonna happen I ain't go
[1:13:15] to church you go to church huh you read
[1:13:20] your Bible you listen that little short
[1:13:23] man why you have to do that why he ain't
[1:13:27] ain't nothing to it
[1:13:29] no they took it serious because it came
[1:13:32] with some authority it came from the
[1:13:35] Kings commandment it was a seal thank
[1:13:41] God for that seal and then he opened it
[1:13:46] up because look being hastened and
[1:13:49] pressed on by the Kings commandment and
[1:13:51] the decree was giving us sheesh on the
[1:13:52] palace and Mordecai went out from the
[1:13:54] presence of the king and what royal
[1:13:56] apparel of Wow what did the angel tell
[1:14:01] brother branham did you be gathered with
[1:14:05] your people you were an important person
[1:14:08] on earth remember he's got a crown laid
[1:14:11] up bigger than ours and you know what
[1:14:14] God did it not some personal son God did
[1:14:21] it God showed him what about how I'm
[1:14:27] staying another day what about brother
[1:14:28] Branham you know he never really
[1:14:29] preached on Esther he never took Esther
[1:14:31] as a text but he spoke of Esther a few
[1:14:34] times but what about him reading that I
[1:14:38] believe he stayed away from that for a
[1:14:40] reason that's just me that's just a me
[1:14:44] quote I think he stayed away from the
[1:14:46] book of Esther because he knew that
[1:14:47] Mordecai
[1:14:48] was him so he stayed away from it you
[1:14:52] you look gonna look up after he only
[1:14:54] speaks of estrus six or eight times and
[1:14:55] it scattered all over the there's no
[1:14:58] sermon of extra chapter one and you
[1:15:01] really never says anything much about
[1:15:02] more to come but if you see a prophet
[1:15:04] reading the Bible and you seem read that
[1:15:06] book of Esther and he goes hmm little
[1:15:10] man little man what's he do oh he's got
[1:15:14] a king's signature he's got a ring he's
[1:15:18] got a position that's just me not just
[1:15:23] me that's just what I think
[1:15:24] all right look at verse fifteen and
[1:15:27] Mordecai went out from the presence of
[1:15:29] the king and royal apparel and blue and
[1:15:32] white with great crown of gold and with
[1:15:34] the garment of fine linen and purple and
[1:15:36] the City of Shushan rejoiced and was
[1:15:40] glad the Jews had light and gladness and
[1:15:44] joy and honor you and I should be the
[1:15:49] same way because we have a chance
[1:15:52] through this little man with what the
[1:15:54] Commission of God to tell us Esther to
[1:15:59] tell us Esther's people how to defend
[1:16:02] ourselves to me that's the greatest
[1:16:05] chapter showing we see adoption we see a
[1:16:09] way to defend ourselves we see that look
[1:16:14] in every province in every city where so
[1:16:17] ever the king's commandment and his
[1:16:19] decree came the Jews had joy and
[1:16:22] gladness a feast and a good day no we
[1:16:33] still got a battle but we know what day
[1:16:37] it is now we know who's coming and we
[1:16:41] got something to defend ourselves with
[1:16:44] and many of the people of the land look
[1:16:47] at this and many of the people of the
[1:16:49] land there's you foolish virgin many of
[1:16:54] the people the land became Jews for the
[1:16:55] fear of the Jews fell upon them you know
[1:16:59] if you knew that you were gonna make
[1:17:02] you gonna tell me how to act
[1:17:12] cuz cuz I'm a heathen and you're a
[1:17:16] Christian you tell me how to act so they
[1:17:19] won't kill me right that's when people
[1:17:24] want to get around you you want to be
[1:17:26] salting the Christian there's a
[1:17:29] Christian that salt in it brings people
[1:17:31] in because you know what they're gonna
[1:17:32] die physically and spiritually this
[1:17:35] world is gonna die and without me and
[1:17:39] you it's gonna be a lot of them but
[1:17:42] God's give us something to defend
[1:17:43] ourselves with amen he's give us
[1:17:48] something to defend ourselves with let's
[1:17:53] continue a few more minutes we'll be
[1:17:54] done
[1:17:55] chapter 9 now what happens is now in the
[1:18:01] twelfth month now we're getting to the
[1:18:02] time we're getting to the time now that
[1:18:07] the things gonna happen we're getting to
[1:18:10] the end time we're at the end time we
[1:18:16] are at the end time they're getting
[1:18:18] toward the end time now in the twelfth
[1:18:21] month that is the month adar in the
[1:18:22] thirteenth day of the same when the
[1:18:24] Kings commandment and here's the Creed
[1:18:26] do near to put in execution now remember
[1:18:28] the day you eat thereof the day you die
[1:18:31] still right here you gonna die there's
[1:18:37] gonna be a battle and without something
[1:18:39] you're gonna die because I have decreed
[1:18:42] that the day you eat thereof the day you
[1:18:44] die so he's not reversing anything when
[1:18:48] the Kings commandment has decreed you
[1:18:50] neared to be put in execution in the day
[1:18:53] that the enemies of the Jews hoped to
[1:18:55] have power over them hmm
[1:18:58] though it was turned to the contrary
[1:19:01] that the root Jews had rule over them
[1:19:04] that hated them look the Jews gathered
[1:19:07] themselves together on Sunday and
[1:19:11] Wednesday
[1:19:15] they knew where to go they didn't just
[1:19:20] stay out in the field they didn't go
[1:19:23] play golf on Sunday a Christian well
[1:19:27] anyway the Jews gathered themselves
[1:19:29] together in their cities
[1:19:31] they knew where to go you and I know
[1:19:35] where to go
[1:19:37] the Jews gathered themselves together in
[1:19:39] their cities throughout all the
[1:19:41] provinces of king of sors to lay hand on
[1:19:43] such as salt their hurt watch this right
[1:19:47] here and no man could withstand them no
[1:19:56] weapon formed can stand against me now
[1:20:01] that's still written in here and no man
[1:20:05] could withstand them for the fear of
[1:20:07] them fell upon all people
[1:20:10] now here's Haman try he was going to
[1:20:13] gather this big group this big bunch of
[1:20:17] demons and we're going after that bride
[1:20:20] we're going to take her over we're going
[1:20:24] to kill her every one of them look how
[1:20:27] God turns it around if you're gonna be a
[1:20:31] priest in the king you're gonna have
[1:20:32] something to rule over and it's not with
[1:20:35] the rod of iron it's with nail-scarred
[1:20:38] hands like Jesus for the fear of them
[1:20:40] fell upon all people don't you know when
[1:20:44] we come to the white throne judgment are
[1:20:45] you gonna be afraid of anything
[1:20:47] noop cuz you don't have to go you're not
[1:20:56] standing out there you're standing is
[1:21:00] the judge and who's gonna be fear who's
[1:21:04] gonna have the fear those people that
[1:21:06] walk up in front of you are gonna look
[1:21:09] at you and go oh my I did that to that
[1:21:15] person and if they're any kind of a
[1:21:18] halfway Christian all they gotta do is
[1:21:20] read the Bible that says if you do that
[1:21:21] to the least of my little ones you've
[1:21:23] done it under me
[1:21:24] that's the same way here the Jew said
[1:21:27] we're Jews we can defend ourselves but
[1:21:31] God even give us so much power that the
[1:21:36] fear of them fell upon all people and
[1:21:38] all the rulers of the province and the
[1:21:41] lieutenant's and the deputies in the
[1:21:43] office of the king help the Jews they
[1:21:48] got converted hallelujah
[1:21:52] they have the Jews now wait a minute
[1:21:54] they're supposed to help to the Medes
[1:21:57] and Persians that great big army mm-hmm
[1:21:59] now if you get converted you won't
[1:22:01] because the fear of Mordechai fell upon
[1:22:04] them from Mordecai was great in the
[1:22:08] King's house and his fame went out
[1:22:11] through all the provinces for this man
[1:22:13] Mordecai watched greater and greater now
[1:22:18] written in my Bible a long time ago when
[1:22:20] I first studied this it wasn't that
[1:22:24] Mordecai grew greater and greater it was
[1:22:27] what he said because he's a little short
[1:22:31] guy like brother Burman said you know
[1:22:32] that hundred fifty-pound God that puts
[1:22:34] his hand up like this and stops at 12
[1:22:35] ton tractor-trailer coming down the road
[1:22:38] it's not the power of the man it's the
[1:22:40] power behind the man so it was the power
[1:22:42] behind Mordecai that helped him graduate
[1:22:45] or wax greater and greater because you
[1:22:47] got to remember Mordecai in this whole
[1:22:49] story he never walks out like Haman and
[1:22:51] says I'm the number one guy I'm the
[1:22:54] number one guy brother I'll never say he
[1:22:56] said I'm the least that's my brush when
[1:22:59] God chose that man above everybody
[1:23:01] he had the character that he needed to
[1:23:04] teach us something
[1:23:06] thus the Jews just slapped all their
[1:23:11] little enemies and and just a toe shoe
[1:23:13] devil go on no they smell off with the
[1:23:20] stroke of the sword
[1:23:24] what's the sword the word they smote him
[1:23:29] with the stroke of the what the power
[1:23:31] that lays in this word and slaughter and
[1:23:35] destruction
[1:23:37] did what they would unto those that
[1:23:39] hated them and in Shushan the palace the
[1:23:43] Jews slew and destroyed 500 men right
[1:23:46] there in the palace and all those words
[1:23:49] I cannot pronounce just keep rolling it
[1:23:52] on up don't even want to let anyone talk
[1:23:54] about them people that's all the
[1:23:56] different places now look even the ten
[1:23:58] sons of Haman he still had some
[1:24:01] preachers out there we forgot about that
[1:24:07] for a minute didn't we Haman had ten
[1:24:10] sons and you know what the sons like the
[1:24:13] daddy so he had ten line preachers out
[1:24:16] there like we were preached before and
[1:24:18] because remember that was 12 spies went
[1:24:20] across the land two of them brought a
[1:24:22] good report ten I'm lied 10 lyin
[1:24:26] preachers
[1:24:27] so the 10 line preachers of Haman guess
[1:24:31] what happened to them they slew them but
[1:24:35] on the spoil Wade they knocked their
[1:24:37] hand they in other words they left that
[1:24:38] part alone well that day the number that
[1:24:40] were slain and she's on the palace was
[1:24:42] brought before the king and the King
[1:24:44] said unto Esther the Queen the Jews have
[1:24:46] slain and destroyed five hundred men in
[1:24:49] the palace and the ten sons of Haman
[1:24:52] what have they done in the rest of the
[1:24:55] king's provinces now what is our
[1:24:57] petition now what every other time when
[1:25:02] she asked for something he said whatever
[1:25:05] you want up to half the kingdom right
[1:25:08] three times said what do you own up to
[1:25:12] half the kingdom now watch this Esther
[1:25:16] comes to a position that it's not half
[1:25:20] anymore this is where you can bring in
[1:25:25] the King of Kings and the Lord of lords
[1:25:29] in Revelations 19 because he has given
[1:25:32] her total power now he's not limiting
[1:25:35] her he says what is that petition and it
[1:25:38] shall be granted thee if she'd have said
[1:25:41] I want every one of your provinces and
[1:25:42] all your gold he would have said here
[1:25:44] now you didn't say that before why
[1:25:47] because he you need to learn trust
[1:25:50] with God he knows who to trust and who
[1:25:53] not but you need to learn trust but in
[1:25:55] here the King was going well I'm not I'm
[1:25:58] not stupid I'm gonna just give her half
[1:26:00] if she asks for it but now what he's
[1:26:03] come to a place to know what she wants
[1:26:06] and he's gonna grant her anything she
[1:26:09] asked or what is thy request further and
[1:26:14] it shall be done when Jesus said it is
[1:26:18] finished on the cross he meant what he
[1:26:21] said now we know that's further work but
[1:26:24] it wasn't him right it was the bride
[1:26:29] what's the future work watch now what
[1:26:32] then said Esther if it pleases the King
[1:26:34] let it be granted to the Jews which are
[1:26:36] in the palace to do tomorrow also
[1:26:38] according to this day's the qurían let
[1:26:40] Haman's ten sons behind in the gallows
[1:26:43] hmm God's not going to put up with that
[1:26:47] false doctrine and the king commanded it
[1:26:51] to be so done and the decree was given
[1:26:54] to in the palace and they hang Haman's
[1:26:56] ten sons for the Jews that were in the
[1:26:58] palace gathered themselves together on
[1:27:00] the fourteenth day of the month of Adar
[1:27:02] and slew three hundred men we already
[1:27:03] know that but to pray they laid not
[1:27:05] their hand but the other Jews that were
[1:27:07] in the Kings probably insist gathered
[1:27:09] themselves together stood for their
[1:27:11] lives had rest from their enemies and
[1:27:15] slew of their foes seventy five thousand
[1:27:19] people remember we've got two hundred
[1:27:24] thousand thousand of them we got to
[1:27:25] destroy remember the demons that were
[1:27:28] loosed in the river Euphrates remember
[1:27:29] this loosed on the bride but we will
[1:27:33] overcome on the 13th day of the month
[1:27:38] adar and on the fourteenth day of the
[1:27:40] same rested day and made it a day of
[1:27:42] feasting and gladness
[1:27:48] hello let's go down skip down to verse
[1:27:50] two number nine chapter now I mean
[1:27:52] number 19 therefore the Jews of the
[1:27:55] villages that dwelt in the unwalled
[1:27:56] towns made the fourteenth day a month
[1:27:58] adar a day of gladness and feasting a
[1:27:59] good day and of sending portions one to
[1:28:02] another and Mordecai wrote these things
[1:28:06] and sent letters unto all the Jews that
[1:28:09] were in all the provinces of king of
[1:28:10] source both nine and far - what to
[1:28:14] stablish this this message to establish
[1:28:18] this message in the different provinces
[1:28:22] all across the country to establish this
[1:28:29] that they should keep the fourteenth day
[1:28:30] of the month adar and the fifteenth day
[1:28:32] of the same yearly as the days were in
[1:28:36] the Jews rested from their enemy our day
[1:28:40] of Purim people it's when we received
[1:28:42] the new birth that's how Jesus said come
[1:28:46] to me all that labor and heavy laden and
[1:28:47] I'll give you rest
[1:28:49] that's the day we destroyed the devil in
[1:28:52] the soul now we've got a process to keep
[1:28:55] going but look and the Jews undertook to
[1:28:58] do as they had begun and has more two
[1:29:00] kind written to them Mordecai Mordecai
[1:29:04] Mordecai and they cast pour which is a
[1:29:08] lot to consume them that was why they
[1:29:10] call it the day of Purim now look at
[1:29:13] verse 25 but when Esther came before the
[1:29:16] king he commanded by letters that his
[1:29:19] wicked device which he devised against
[1:29:21] the Jews should return upon his own head
[1:29:24] and that he and his son should be hung
[1:29:26] on the gallows he's talking about Haman
[1:29:27] wherefore they call those days Purim
[1:29:29] after the day of pure therefore for all
[1:29:32] the words of this letter that's which
[1:29:34] they had seen concerning this matter in
[1:29:36] which had come unto them the Jews
[1:29:38] ordained and took upon them and upon
[1:29:40] their seed it's still going on today and
[1:29:43] upon all such as joined themselves unto
[1:29:45] them so that they should not fail that
[1:29:48] they will keep these two days according
[1:29:50] to the writings of the according to
[1:29:51] their appointed time every year and that
[1:29:54] these days should be remembered it's so
[1:29:57] important see we get to do it on Sunday
[1:30:01] and Wednesday
[1:30:02] play when we read the Bible when we read
[1:30:04] the message we've got a continual feast
[1:30:06] day that's why we're talking about we're
[1:30:08] gonna talk about these feast days
[1:30:09] because they're they're very important
[1:30:11] to us without the feast days you don't
[1:30:14] get born again you don't go in the
[1:30:16] rapture so I'm pretty important you know
[1:30:21] and that these days of Purim should not
[1:30:24] fail them on the Jews and other memorial
[1:30:26] then perish from their seed now watch
[1:30:28] this I like this right here
[1:30:32] I wrote my I wrote I wrote in the Bible
[1:30:35] right here I wrote where is the King you
[1:30:40] hadn't heard from them in a while
[1:30:42] where's the king I thought he's one who
[1:30:45] had all the authority but I thought he's
[1:30:48] one that transferred all the authority
[1:30:50] because what's this then Esther the
[1:30:53] Queen will be finished on here then
[1:30:54] Esther the Queen the daughter of Abigail
[1:30:57] and Mordecai the Jew wrote with all
[1:31:01] authority to confirm this second letter
[1:31:06] of Purim and he sent letters unto all
[1:31:09] the Jews to the hundred and twenty-seven
[1:31:10] provinces of the kingdom of a source
[1:31:13] with words of peace and truth what's
[1:31:22] this to confirm these days of pyramid
[1:31:25] their times appointed according as more
[1:31:28] to college you and Esther the Queen
[1:31:29] hadn't joined them now you're not
[1:31:31] hearing anything about the king in other
[1:31:34] words he has he's he's running the
[1:31:36] universe and Mordecai and Esther is now
[1:31:41] running the show amen but remember he
[1:31:48] didn't do that at the beginning this is
[1:31:51] at the end of the journey this is at the
[1:31:53] end of your journey remember she's not a
[1:31:55] she's not a bride anymore she's a wife
[1:31:58] and man and we've got Mordecai there
[1:32:01] we're a Mordecai's message it's becoming
[1:32:04] more real how many times listen how many
[1:32:09] times you go through the day and
[1:32:11] something happens and you think of what
[1:32:15] brother brown said
[1:32:16] it ain't many days goodbye that I don't
[1:32:18] something a little something will happen
[1:32:20] it doesn't matter if it's in your life
[1:32:21] or anything
[1:32:22] you'll hear you'll hear that Mordecai
[1:32:26] say something that pertains to our
[1:32:31] effects what you're doing right and
[1:32:37] that's not bad that's good that God
[1:32:41] brings to your remembrance what he has
[1:32:45] said to confirm these days of Purim and
[1:32:47] in their times appointed according to
[1:32:48] more to college you and Esther the Queen
[1:32:50] hadn't joined them as they had decreed
[1:32:53] for themselves and for their seed the
[1:32:58] matters of the fasting in the crime and
[1:33:00] the decree of Esther I'm Mordecai not
[1:33:07] the king Esther Esther has become listen
[1:33:11] at the first of this of this act or play
[1:33:15] she wasn't so very important she was a
[1:33:17] little poor girl didn't have a mom and
[1:33:19] dad and was raised by her uncle look
[1:33:21] what she's risen to when you and I
[1:33:24] started our journey were nothing but to
[1:33:28] God he knows that that's why I love this
[1:33:30] journey of a believer it takes everybody
[1:33:33] even Ruth look at Ruth Ruth was nobody
[1:33:36] she was the ball by this and everybody
[1:33:37] nobody knew who she was now she's the
[1:33:42] most important person in the world at
[1:33:43] the end of this at the end of the of the
[1:33:45] program the mama goes off to say or the
[1:33:49] mother-in-law goes you know off the
[1:33:50] scene and then here she goes and gets
[1:33:52] with with Boaz and then they have a baby
[1:33:55] and then mama steps back on the same
[1:33:58] well she has to because that's the Jews
[1:34:00] coming back what's this and the decree
[1:34:03] of Esther confirmed these matters of
[1:34:05] Purim and it was written in the book
[1:34:10] Esther birth chapter 10 this is the end
[1:34:12] of it right here what's this and the
[1:34:16] king of Soros laid a tribute upon the
[1:34:20] land and upon the Isles of the sea that
[1:34:22] means he put one foot on land and one
[1:34:26] foot on sea
[1:34:28] and all the acts of his power and of his
[1:34:32] might and the declaration of the
[1:34:34] greatness of Mordecai weren't to the
[1:34:36] king advanced him are they not written
[1:34:40] in the book of the chronicles of the
[1:34:41] kings of the Medes and Persians this
[1:34:44] whole world is going to have to proclaim
[1:34:48] who we are for Mordecai the Jew was next
[1:34:54] unto king of Soros and great among the
[1:34:58] Jews and accepted of the multitude of
[1:35:02] his brethren seeking the wealth of his

[1:35:27] seeking the wealth of his people and
[1:35:29] speaking peace to all his seed that's

[1:36:30] fight the things that we have in our
[1:36:32] life and he goes swimming and he's got a
[1:36:39] pair of pair overall
[1:36:41] that's held on with a nail one nail
[1:36:48] don't even have enough he'll have two
[1:36:51] nails though John cuz there's two straps
[1:36:52] on it
[1:36:53] he had one probably hanging down and
[1:36:55] once one nail stuck through that what a
[1:37:04] man what a man I'll clap what a man what
[1:37:11] a mortar kind that he walks up and goes
[1:37:13] through the town and he said people
[1:37:15] would walk on the other side of the
[1:37:16] street because he had a bad name he had
[1:37:20] a bad name Brandon was not a good name
[1:37:24] all of them were dump drunks died with
[1:37:27] the boots on basically the cliche I
[1:37:29] guess you might say and here God took
[1:37:32] that man out of obscurity he gave him a
[1:37:38] position when he was over there I passed
[1:37:41] the curtain of time he said they lifted
[1:37:43] me up on their shoulders they did not
[1:37:46] him they did and they said you're
[1:37:50] special down here but you got to go back
[1:37:54] because you got some more sermons to
[1:37:56] preach you've got some Mordecai you got
[1:37:59] some more work to do because I'm gonna
[1:38:02] take you up on the mountain one day and
[1:38:03] I'm gonna give you the signal and if
[1:38:07] anybody hears anything it's got to come
[1:38:09] from you if you're gonna take a body
[1:38:12] change bride it's got to come from this
[1:38:14] message of the hour it cannot come from
[1:38:17] the Bible alone you got to have the
[1:38:23] prophets message to line that up because
[1:38:26] remember King wrote it and you die
[1:38:30] because the day you eat thereof that day
[1:38:34] you're gonna die sorry John the day you
[1:38:37] eat thereof the day you're gonna die we
[1:38:40] have no hope I'll fly away Oh glory I'll
[1:38:46] fly away when I die
[1:38:48] everybody's on my desk
[1:38:55] but when you open it up and you see the
[1:39:00] love letter how can he kill his bride
[1:39:03] how could he kill Esther even when she
[1:39:07] walked in and said if I die today I die
[1:39:10] today I'm gonna get something from the
[1:39:13] King can you say that today today I'm
[1:39:18] going to get something from the king god
[1:39:23] bless you let's stand to our feet did
[1:39:30] you know that story of Esther like the
[1:39:34] all the commentators tell you they put
[1:39:38] that in the Bible even though it had
[1:39:42] made no mention of God but as Scofield
[1:39:46] toll tells us as we've seen these past
[1:39:51] few services it is so interlaced with
[1:39:53] the Christian journey and so interlaced
[1:39:56] with and but see now look let me tell
[1:39:58] you how this goes further doctor
[1:40:02] Scofield probably looked it looked at
[1:40:05] this
[1:40:05] aster and said what that's the bride
[1:40:09] well who's this mordecai guy who's just
[1:40:13] mordecai guy he he's inserted all that
[1:40:16] stuff that's the father or the uncle
[1:40:19] that's that's helping this Esther but
[1:40:23] you and I you and I know what that
[1:40:27] character portrayed we saw him and we
[1:40:31] heard him with our own ears and sister
[1:40:35] Clayton some of them had seen him with
[1:40:37] his own eyes sister Margaery pray to you
[1:40:39] you were little no you sat on his lap
[1:40:45] I'm brother brown flap did you really
[1:40:47] well that's great you were well you
[1:40:49] could have been more than four or five
[1:40:51] or three okay so that means that Freight
[1:40:53] is 60 years old so I you just told your
[1:40:56] age I just I'm just telling you but we
[1:41:00] can you know we have all these we've
[1:41:02] seen this but what is it done for us
[1:41:04] it's drove a lot
[1:41:06] people away but it's made a lot of
[1:41:09] people more established in the present
[1:41:12] day truth it's made people more
[1:41:16] established because of listening to that
[1:41:19] little Mordecai and doing what he said
[1:41:21] because you know what he's not going to
[1:41:23] tell you anything different from the
[1:41:24] king if it would have been any time that
[1:41:27] that King said oh wait a minute no it's
[1:41:31] just like when Adam was on the earth and
[1:41:34] he was naming the animals and he named
[1:41:36] that elephant that great thing with the
[1:41:38] trunk he named it an elephant God didn't
[1:41:40] go no I wouldn't name that he said
[1:41:42] that's exactly what I named that that's
[1:41:45] the same way brother Branham when he
[1:41:46] said he went back into the mind of God
[1:41:48] he didn't just stay there he brought it
[1:41:51] right out here and he and we got it in
[1:41:53] eleven hundred sermons we got it in

[1:47:18] they didn't put the instruments up they
[1:47:23] brought them out and they had a feast
[1:47:26] for two days why because they had
[1:47:29] defeated an enemy that was proclaiming
[1:47:33] that they don't have a chance we're so
[1:47:37] much bigger than they are
[1:47:39] we've got a kingdom from India to
[1:47:44] Ethiopian we're just gonna wipe you
[1:47:46] little people off the earth and the Jews
[1:47:50] said well we do have a right to defend
[1:47:54] ourselves and we've been given the
[1:47:57] provision and the very day that you guys
[1:48:00] are gonna attack so we're gonna be ready
[1:48:05] and brother John when you get some days
[1:48:07] when you do have my head laid over like
[1:48:09] this and you go devil when I get up when
[1:48:15] I get up you're a goner when you get up
[1:48:21] in the morning and you put your feet on
[1:48:23] the floor all hell's against you but
[1:48:29] there's provision been made
[1:48:33] we're not fighting with feathers we're
[1:48:37] fighting with swords and we win
[1:48:41] whatever happens Rodin doesn't matter we
[1:48:44] win we've already won if we're born
[1:48:47] again but we don't really win when we
[1:48:51] walk in one day and the redeemed walked
[1:48:56] through those gates and the Angels have
[1:48:59] to stop because they can't join in
[1:49:03] they've never been redeemed but you and
[1:49:06] I came from a life of sin and by God
[1:49:12] calling you and you accepting the call
[1:49:14] it's like brother Dale was preaching
[1:49:16] that you got to remember just for a
[1:49:18] minute here we're gonna go outside and
[1:49:20] talk to a five o'clock anyway or longer
[1:49:24] God is calling you how is he calling you
[1:49:28] to a preacher through you reading the
[1:49:31] Bible through the message of the hour
[1:49:35] that's where he's calling you and then
[1:49:37] all of a sudden one day you say well
[1:49:40] I've been seeking God no it's him what
[1:49:42] happened the the switch was he spoke to
[1:49:45] you first he said I didn't hear God
[1:49:50] listen what convicted you somebody
[1:49:55] bringing something to you that brought
[1:50:00] conviction to you
[1:50:01] well that wasn't brother Dale our
[1:50:04] brother wait that was God
[1:50:08] because God knew what you would need
[1:50:10] because how many hundreds of times have
[1:50:11] you listened to other places other
[1:50:14] sermons other people but all of a sudden
[1:50:17] you go talking to me right you remember
[1:50:24] that you better I'll remember that that
[1:50:26] there was one day when something caught
[1:50:28] your voice now after that you stopped
[1:50:30] guarding you why because you felt what
[1:50:35] listen you got fat be found lost before
[1:50:38] you can be found you got to be found
[1:50:40] lost you gotta say I'm lost I'm lost and
[1:50:45] then God speaks to you
[1:50:47] so it's God calling you the whole time
[1:50:50] they don't matter how many sermons you
[1:50:52] hear there's one sermon in this
[1:50:54] scripture and this don't scripture in
[1:50:57] this Bible that's the sermon that's
[1:50:58] gonna click in your heart see mine what
[1:51:03] in Genesis 1:26 cuz I ain't have
[1:51:04] anything I didn't have a clue bout
[1:51:05] Genesis 1:26 when I was a sinner but
[1:51:08] once I become a Christian but the other
[1:51:11] scriptures in the Bible I knew I was
[1:51:13] condemned Bible when I come to that
[1:51:14] Genesis 1 it was after I got born again
[1:51:16] and God started unfolding and he said
[1:51:18] that's you that's when I made you now
[1:51:23] remember we didn't have a beginning but
[1:51:25] that was when we were what put on
[1:51:27] display that's when we were put on
[1:51:31] display and God said there's mum there's
[1:51:34] my bride
[1:51:35] there's my Adam and there's my Eve I'm
[1:51:39] gonna have a family now all these
[1:51:43] ministers god bless you
[1:51:47] you do the work of the Lord it doesn't
[1:51:49] matter if people fall asleep on you Bob
[1:51:51] [Music]
[1:51:55] I'm getting to that somewhere you're
[1:52:02] just preaching to one person but God
[1:52:06] didn't put you up here to preach to
[1:52:09] nobody he gives you a job to preach to
[1:52:13] one person maybe one person will get
[1:52:17] what you said the rest won't but then
[1:52:19] the next sermon how many of you heard me
[1:52:21] the next sermon the next preacher comes
[1:52:22] in and the preachers preaches something
[1:52:24] and you get a blessing from Oh see
[1:52:28] that's the way God works
[1:52:29] that's our King he knows what we need he
[1:52:34] puts you in the service to get it
[1:52:36] [Music]
[1:52:39] predestination
[1:52:41] but he knew you would want it and he got
[1:52:45] it for you he put it in a book that'll
[1:52:49] kill you what a paradox he put it in a
[1:52:53] book full of judgment but he gave you
[1:52:57] see always see now his Christian always
[1:52:59] see his life every Scripture we read we
[1:53:02] see life even when you look at the
[1:53:05] judgment I've already been judged I
[1:53:07] don't like to be judged again I've
[1:53:10] already been judged I was chosen in him
[1:53:13] and he was judged if he's judged perfect
[1:53:17] I'm perfect that's what we gotta say I
[1:53:21] look at him if the devil looks at me I
[1:53:25] go that man died for me and Jesus go
[1:53:28] talk to him
[1:53:29] if you got a problem with me go talk to
[1:53:32] him because I was chosen in him before
