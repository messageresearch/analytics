ready Tom I don't have to introduce these people to you I hope not because you order know them anyway god bless y'all good to be here in the house of the Lord so much is happening I'm sorry I've missed the last couple of meetings but I was out of peanut butter but we bought a big old bucket of it so the message means more to me now than it ever has in my whole life we're living in a world where people are looking for proof of what's right or not you know so they seek it on the Internet you know just recently you could always look up on Snopes and that would be a website to tell you what the truth of the matter was well brother Homer they got arrested for lying if you know we we are in a world where there's a lot of versions now of the Bible there's lots of if you if you wanna I told someone will brother Brian and prayed for someone and you know that they could see again he says well watch this and he showed me on a website or a man was walking on the water you know in a pool and so because of modern technology you can see all sorts of things and so if you're looking for proof of whether something is right or not it depends where you found what you found I was shown the message of the hour by people by the life of the message living in them I was shown the message the hour when I was sick and they said God heals and I got healed it was proven to me by what happened to me and I don't think you can ever find out if something's right or wrong online I think it'll be between you and the good Lord if that's where you got it from and I just encourage everybody you know I I I saw I got comforted when I had a son who died I've got I got I got carried when my mom died by by believers I witnessed people come together when my daughter was was sick I felt it I I asked them in Cambodia why do you believe the message of the hour this what we felt the anointing of God when we heard the word preached I I asked them in Chile why do you believe the message of the hour they said we saw God in a people and I see God in a people in the incredible strength of truth is something that will not go away in it the truth can't be disproved I I just love this with all my heart and just it will carry us through and it will show us everything we need to know speaking of the Holy Bible message the hour I believe the Bible is our absolute I believe the prophets have the revelation to that absolute and I believe that's absolutely the truth and you know I saw you know people lose a wife and continue on I remember one time when my daughter come home from the hospital and she probably get so embarrassed you know I was mentioning but we we we couldn't help her and she was getting worse and worse after all the work of that hospital I witnessed Christ come in people and this little family come over and they just took over the care of my daughter and right in front of me showed me what to do and they just loved her right back into into health I saw that you can't take away something that someone is witnessed and if we love the Lord with all our heart he promises he'll be in the midst of our worship he promises where two or three are gathered together he'll be there he promises he will never leave us nor forsake us he promises Aussie will be with us even unto the end of the consummation this message of life is true because it lives in me and I continually witness it in others and it will carry you it as great get back up power it as it has great reconciliation power don't be foolish enough to disclude some of our people because they are no longer believe in don't worry God will take care of that he knew the end from the beginning you know it you know he even spoke about the sparrow he had a sermon about the ant people take care of everything in it it's been a wonderful wonderful time and I just I see less of Tom crochet now brother homer than I guess twenty years ago and maybe a little bit more of the Lord and I love them with all my heart I'm still seeing when the word goes out it just needs to be landowner on a seat of God and if the seat of God hears that word it'll do what it's what the Bible promises that we're doing and you know there are some people on this earth that can hear no other voice but the voice of God jesus said my sheep hear my voice and another they won't hear you know and I I'm getting to feel so sad for those that can't hear the voice I'm not angry at them I I wish some of my family could see this I would I would walk to Wisconsin to get it for but I do trust that all God has foreordained will come and I trust that we're gonna be in heaven together and there you know I looked and I saw some of these young brothers and I thought wow you know they were looking really young but it was their sons it was their daughters wow that she still looks so pretty you know the service got me right when I heard that little violin player I can imagine that in heaven that God might just say hey would you come on over here and maybe a crowd of a million people and they'll set her up on a valley and say would you play that song again No won't that be a time so if you got a gift just keep courage or I felt got all over it I feel God all over this message I forgot all over the Bible you know but it's a world where there's a lot of trouble but look past the trouble it's a fallen nature world and we are people that have heard the voice of God we go towards that voice do your best if you stumble get right back up this is not the day to quit I love the Lord with Omaha I love what the growth I'm seeing in people dear friends that have been sweet to me this for so long it's so supportive I still wear suits from brother Samuel Dale I kept him longer than you kept them now they're fitting me better too I love the Lord I think my son has a song and then I believe the girl send David ever saw David come on oh god bless you [Applause] [Music] or Satan's trying to win [Music] when you give to heaven after the trumpet sounds you decide to look me huh don't waste your time I won't be at my mansion you won't find me by the sea just fine Jesus there are I want to see the unseen arms held me through the stars I want to touch the hand lentils and completely changed my heart I wanna hear him speak the words that brought such peace just fine Jesus there are [Music] when I step through those pearly gates there'll be so much to see I'll be bowled mansions Hall and stroll down golden streets though the splendor will be amazing there's only one attraction for me just fine Jesus there are I wanna see the unseen arms help me through the stores I wanna touch the hand that touched and completely changed my heart I want to hear him speak the words that brought such peace to me just fine Jesus their RV just fine geez [Music] [Applause] amen that's where we all ought to be in finding Jesus that's where we'll be amen we've all messed up with our sound systems and everything so we got trainers back here another over here and we are Indian she's not doing a good either so there are things behind running it's okay it will have no warp I will be all right okay all right I think we've covered all the passengers now visit any pastors left I know brother yeah we got him he's he's like but we cover the passengers because that's what we want to make sure that they get covered and welcomed and everything you know and then we'll go from dark to others and in this fellowship and we appreciate you traveling a lot of distance and listen that's the reason we say keep it down don't I mean everybody won't sing 14 songs read 89 scriptures you know that's all right but when we are gathered to her when we get through the night a lot of you gonna be traveling 200 miles to get home well it's a whole lot easier if you're not staying so late getting to going so if you get feelings hurt at me for being a little bit tight on her strange we let brother Homer do it next time cuz he can say things nobody don't get upset with him it's just that's brother homeroom so but you know novel come on brother Wes come on up and welcome represent brother yep see anything saying us a song you praise the Lord for all of these and you know they take everybody's traveled a long way so let's get that and you go ahead okay here it's just such a sweet presence in this place a man it's good to see so many familiar faces and just be able to have my family here it's good to have my mother-in-law she came up with us today and I was excited about that amen so it's been a little while since she's been able to travel up with us so another thing that I've bring ingredients from the David Yancey in the church Empire in Georgia amen and the Saints there and we're thankful for what God is doing among these people amen and we're so thankful I look around and I see all the young people in this church and that inspires my heart amen to see that God is working not just among the old but among the young brother Tom your son getting up and playing and my goodness we ought we have so much to be thankful for we ought to be praising him every day and thanking him every day for not just giving us this glorious message but keeping us day by day amen and allowing us to grow in in that so we just trust that this song would be a blessing to you and I think I was less than two minutes I hope for

seat certainly good to be here today and I hadn't seen some of my brothers for a long time and I said if we're still brothers ain't real home burn he said yeah we are brother Sam - and I appreciate the lawyer you know when he laid his foundation out that he included me ain't it I know there's a lot of people working trying to make it but they won't make it when I listen to the end time message it sent to one people he goes out to the world but he's got an ear let him hear I got an island see and that was determined before the foundation of the world we just privileged to be here and be able to see that praise the Lord and we're getting on in years I know a lot of people are going on and won't be long time in sister Lorene but I'm gonna do all the years again so you got the same sweetheart daughter kids raised and I ain't much left new but go home that's it for the Homer go home I remember I was I was that age that brother brand talked about they got stole from the Eagle I was born in a woman's church Trinity and you know uh she said we got one of our own and brother Herman was born but she didn't know this right I couldn't save her what I believed in and I believed in one God and then I soon found out women didn't have a right to preach I had to slow so that aside the wallets down there you know and that revival Roma revival center there's a guy come by with a little 8:45 record and he had preacher man on it and I really liked that song I played it a lot of times on my radio broadcasts and when preachers that come behind me I'd already have them climbing the wall one of your desks all event but get over at home I'll Brown I stood for something if you don't brother Tom you'll fall friend as I Amen so let me try it I'll try mm-hmm my daughter sir in here today and so I'll this have to do the best I can again amen I appreciate your lorries giving me a lot of good kids and grandkids you know I think when it's all counted up we got about twenty three grandkids about - hey Fran and Rick can bring you know ask for a blessing that old man like me brother Sam they even outright they say I'm saying gee I don't know I'll preach the word Whitworth preacher man rasuu it would work preacher man heal the sick he'll delight it all in Jesus name word word word preacher man now some bows go to college to learn how to breathe some bows go to Jesus handing it in on their knee as for me I'm serving the father and the son but wait you have him all up dear all three and one great sword wears worth a Chairman resilvered work or reach a man heal the sick he'll delight put it all in Jesus name preach the word preach a man they go down to the river and say they'll be baptized they take the name of Jesus and laid on the side they take the name of father and the name of son but when you add them all up they're all three in one so Edward a chairman salud preacher man he'll distinct he'll delight in Jesus name Subban preach the word preach the word preach remain amen all right go down to you brother Homer come on agree to people I reckon we recognized all the churches and everything that we could we miss you then we're sorry by invite us all together bit right ain't nobody left praise the Lord he miss she's good to be in the house of the Lord Amen it's good to be the house of the Lord amen amen I just preached appreciate the Lord and and I don't know most maybe y'all heard but you know brother David Berst had shot itself and shot his wife as a church in Claremore Oklahoma and so yeah you know his son-in-law does it Church so he has three daughters so don't you remember them you know in your prayers and you just don't never know what life holds you know you know before we get out of here you know and so I just ask you to remember remember that family you know and because I know God's I know their hurt you know and you lose your mom and dad at the same time you know it's early and if something like that is really really sad you know and so certainly want to remember them amen in our prayers and then just good and but I do want to add something what brother Dale said now the reason we want you to get out of here and we get out of here is because the sisters has to clean up after we leave and they need to come to church tomorrow and they're waving at me so that's one of the things I said now well we're driving down the road dry you're cleaning up hello and so so anyhow that's why we want to help them too right I mean they got feelings you know you know and so after they prepare it and then they've got to feed you and and then they you know and then they clean up while we go home full stomach amen so uh amen I appreciate - appreciate that brother tom has got to fellowship meeting in May you know God willing if we - that long and and you know and I was thinking about something my brother Billy Paul said one time and they they asked him he said do you understand all that's in the Bible he said no I don't understand he said the thing it bothers me is the part that I do that I don't see in my life that I don't see in my life that support it bothers me all the message you know they don't bother I've heard it I've read my Bible through and through and through and through and through but deported bothers me is how much of it is being identified because you see you know as brother better said the church is gonna be in the minority and he keeps saying you know it's getting smaller and smaller and smaller this because you know you know my little my little grandson great-grandson and Herman saying you had some mini and so I'm just getting them by the droves I mean they just come in like you know like you know whatever and and so my little grandson the other day he says he walking around the house and he said I just need the Holy Ghost he's two years old and I said son what did you say he said Papa we just need the whole ego so his daddy come in and he said daddy we need the Holy Ghost he said what is it where you get it at he said you got to go to church and I thought if I ever was a true saying if there ever was a need is the Holy Ghost I mean a real birth amen not not just to baptism a real birth a birth of this word in this hour amen the word actually changes our life actually it's not just looking up here and saying brother Branham said amen it's something amen it actually changes you amen and actually you know this satisfies you no matter what amen and so it's something that keeps us when you can't keep yourself amen and what you don't even want to keep yourself amen it keeps you it's an anchor amen amen and thank God that he sent this in this hour but if he had never sent the Holy Ghost amen we could hear the Prophet 24/7 you know never understood or you never got ahold of it but because of the Holy Ghost that we could receive the spiritual revelation of the word of God for the hour that you said Amen that he's sin so so by God's grace amen I appreciated my grandson coming up Ernie said I don't want to look at cartoons he don't want to look or if he wants to hear gospel music they meant and so I said I won't ever stay at my house no amen so somebody told me said get you a puppy or get you a dog since that the mortgage is gone I so don't need another that and so he gave me a great-grandson amen and so we built him a pulpit so now he preaches man and so now he preaches to all of us they Manning and so he imitates everybody he ever sees come to the church and so we would brother jewel for knew was at church Wednesday night and we was riding that we was going to eat after service and I said it you liked that preacher yeah and I said you like his preaching he said he's a far ball hey man so you know you know that you know God still got somebody but I thought out of the mouths of babes at sunrise amen and I said that boy end up saving the whole old community apart all his people they men so he Amen so he's fixing to have two sisters come on the scene they go my daughter granddaughters gonna have twins and so I already got for honor just had gone on by my mortgages anniversary and I thought we we had a we had a great great grandson on our anniversary amen and I thought man you know God just knows how to bless me amen amen somewhere Becky's here Becky Calhoun amen you aim if you'll come amen then I appreciate all of you I appreciate all of your prayers I appreciate you standing with me during my tribe amen and you know because hey listen it hadn't been easy man but God still God amen like he said God knew brother brother Tom said God you how to do when he lost the son I'll tell you what some of us in here knows how you do it when you lose a companion amen and I'm gonna tell you what if you're a man and you love a woman for 50 years you can't thank for yourself she thanks for you I mean you don't think for yourself amen amen and so thank God amen amen so I just appreciate it what God let me out for

Christ has that 20/20 spiritual supernatural vision to be able to see the word in this day the bride is naturally spiritual and normally supernatural a true believer of this message has a divine purpose in their life they have supernatural intelligence intelligence that cannot be seen by the FBI or the CIA or the NSA or the Mossad or all the intelligence agencies of the world that spend billions and billions searching for intelligence on other governments and yet Jesus Christ was able through a humble prophet and be able to come in and confound the entire world because he had a bride that he had to impregnate with that supernatural seed to believe this word and I'm so happy to be here so happy - brother Sam invited me to come I called them up and told them I was coming last month and gonna visit some churches so he asked me to come for the fellowship meeting I bumped it on and so I've been in North Carolina and South Carolina then I flew home and came back and I always loved southern hospitality I was born in the north just outside of Boston and didn't get civilized so I came down south when I was a kid I used to pack the car in Harvard Square and take a shower every hour and when I came down South had learned talked all over again and when I heard people say y'all I said oh god never let me say that word and three months later I see y'all coming and it's so wonderful to be here and to look at so many familiar faces and so much history that I have with so many people in the audience I was glad to hear brother Wes thing today and brother Bisco sends his greetings and sister Bissell and all the saints in Cloverdale and i don't know how many people told me to greet brother Wes and I could tell you a lot of stories about brother Wes maybe I'll tell you one real quick first time I come to Cloverdale we're at a special meeting and in brother Wes he he saw me and he had a little a little it looked like an egg and he said hey brother and he catch and he threw this rubber egg and I was expecting a thing to explode all over me but it was a rubber egg and he thought that was funny so then after the meeting we're getting ready to go over to have dinners about 15 people waiting for dinner and so brother Wes comes over he's a brother and he I want to show you something he's 12 years old now I said yeah what he got with he said I got these handcuffs I said yeah he said I want to slap him on you so I said alright brother Wes go ahead he slapped them on me they were real genuine police handcuffs and then he sat back and a big old smile he says no key and it was true there was no key and for hour-and-a-half they had to search all around the houses and garage looking for that key and brother West's dad brother Ken he saw what happened and brother Wes he got some posterior stimulation and I can tell you a whole bunch more but I won't I'm just so glad at what God has done in West's life and and see his family and to hear them saying and it's just so great to be among real believers and knowing that we came from the mind of God we're going back to the mind of God and I just want to start by opening the Word of God today and I'd like to invite you to the book of Acts and chapter 9 and we're going to start reading at verse 1 and before we read let's let's pray father words sometimes seem so inadequate to be able to thank you that you have passed by billions and billions of people who are living on the earth now and the billions who have lived and died since a prophet of God has come and yet Lord you have looked down upon us and you have seen fit before the foundation of the world to call us your children and to reveal to us this great and mysterious and glorious supernatural message Lord you've taken us from insanity to reality to deity Lord and to know that we're deity and it's such a humbling experience father lord I pray that you would take the word today and only you can make this word live in the hearts and minds of of your children father you know you have a purpose for this meeting lord I pray that all all flesh would get out of the way and that only the Holy Ghost would be seen and heard and have its desired impact on our lives today we ask all these blessings and your precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen in Acts chapter 9 and verse 1 and Saul breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogue's if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem so let's have our seats there I just want to start with with just a couple of scriptures I know you've been standing for a while and if we can just go back just a little bit when Stephen was preaching about Jesus Christ and Stephen was a deacon and he was preaching a very powerful message he was blasting the religious leaders for what they had done to Jesus Christ and identified them as Messiah and and finally they were so outraged and they were so beside themselves that they look for somebody that could give them authority to stone Stephen and here's Saul a young man he's standing there and Saul consented to their death he said you get the rocks I'll hold the coats and they stoned Stephen and in the last word Stephen said he said I saw the Lord standing at the right hand of God I believe that the Lord stood to receive Stephen as Azzam as a martyr and and and now when Saul he was a religious fanatic his family were wealthy people and he could have gone into the business world but there was something inside of him that he wanted to serve God and by his own admission he was he was religious he was if anybody fasted Paul fasted more if anybody studied Paul did more if they prayed Paul did more he excel everybody around him and and so now all of this time Saul has got a zyre wants to serve God and then this this situation with Stephen comes up in the Sanhedrin Council they say Saul we're looking for a guy like you we've got a big problem here we've got these people called Christians these these vermin you know I could use a lot of other words you know I could use the word cockroaches because that's the way the Pharisees thought about the Christians and we need an exterminator we need somebody to rid Jerusalem and rid all of our land from these people they are heretics they are blaspheming and they are causing a nuisance and we've heard about you and we need you we need will empower you we will fund your ministry whatever you need you need man you need horses whatever you need you just go and do whatever it takes lock them up beat them whip them kill them whatever it takes you can imagine Saul's mind now so I knew all that praying was gonna pay off someday I knew all that fasting and now look at me Sanhedrin Council World Council of Churches needs me they got a job for me to do an important job and he went after his job with enthusiasm he was like a pit bull dog on a meat wagon he was like a heat-seeking missile like a laser beam and he did everything that he could now remember these people that Paul went after these were Holy Ghost filled freshly minted Holy Ghost filled Christians men women and children and Saul and his men I mean you know that they were dog they were lower than dogs and they didn't care if they beat him and they whipped them and they threw him into prison and Saul I mean he was he felt justified he was proud of what he was doing and one day you know here is and he's right maybe riding on his big steed and the Lord said okay Saul you and I've got an appointment and he comes let's read a little further and so any desired letters to damascus to the synagogues that even found any in this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound to Jerusalem and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there shine around him a light from heaven and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto Him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me now brother Branham said Saul being the kind of a Pharisee that he was he never would have said what he said here unless he knew what he was saying and he said who art thou Lord Saul knew that was the pillar of fire that had knocked him off his horse and now Saul said who art thou who are you that has just intercepted my life and knocked me down to the ground and the Lord said I am Jesus whom now persecute us and Jesus said this very succinctly he said it's hard to kick against the pricks isn't it you know people who are backslidden and want to serve the world for a while it's hard to kick against the pricks because of your true Son of God you're gonna come some way if God has to knock you over the head or a car accident or a sickness or whatever it is you're gonna come and so come easy you know come home come home quickly brother Branham said when he was here it was three minutes to midnight I wonder how many seconds to midnight it may be right now and so he said it's hard to kick against the pricks and he trembling and astonished said Lord what wilt thou have me to do so Paul Najee this is an emergency this is a 900 situation Paul says what do you want me to do shucks he said Jesus Jesus just knocked me off my horse the Messiah the one that they are saying was Messiah and it was true and he said unto Him arise go into the city and it shall be told thee what thou must do and the men which journey with him stood speechless and he boys but seeing no man and Saul arose from the earth and when his eyes were opened he was blind I think his eyes were open he saw no man he was blind but they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus and he was there three days without sight my brother branham said do you like to read between the lines is the sweetest truths or between the lines and when you think now here's Saul you know he was knocked off that big old horse now he's blind maybe he's had to hold onto the bridle of the saddle and the men lead him into a room and he's got a predestinated place to go and spend three days and he did not eat or drink Saul he was he was in a crisis situation and there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias and to him said the Lord in a vision Ananias and he said Behold I am here Lord I wonder why people have trouble believing that God speaks to people through angels and visions they have to they have to just disavow the supernatural essence of the Bible and so he said he said I am here and he said unto Him arise and go unto the street which is called a straight and inquire in the house of Judas for one call Saul of Tarsus before behold he praedyth if anybody in the world was praying Saul was praying but but but Ananias he said in a scene a vision of a man Ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight now Ananias right away you know it's he's an emergency situation he said Lord you know just paraphrase he said lord I have heard about that man he is a dangerous man and now you want me to go in and go to see him the Lord said don't worry he's fryin and he says he said he says I have heard many of this man how much evil he had done to thy Saints in Jerusalem and here he had Authority now Ananias is reminding Lord what he knows about this guy he has authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on his name but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake I believe maybe the Lord just showed him a little bit I believe if the Lord showed saw all that he was going to have to suffer he would have fainted he would have not even wanted to start that race so he said I must show him the things he must suffer for my name say and Ananias went away and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said with a koppel love to this man that was cursed you know but by all the Jews in that area for what he had done with a koppel love he says brother Saul the Lord even Jesus had appeared unto thee in the way as how camus hath sent me that thou mightest received thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost and immediately fell from his eyes that had been scales and he received sight for with and arose and was baptized and when he received me he was strengthened then was Saul certain days with the disciples would for at Damascus now this is where I want to speak a little bit I want you to take and put yourself just try to be a fly on the wall when Saul this man who has just experienced one of the greatest paradigm shifts in the history of the world now a paradigm shift the definition of a paradigm shift is a radical change of thought brought about by a very unusual situation or a keen insight into a matter and Paul he had a great paradigm shift it was a radical change of thought a revolutionary truth had come into his life and now he goes among the Apostles the ones that he had persecuted now Saul he's still the same radical religious man he still got that same passion that same burning desire for God but now he has been rerouted now he sees the error of his ways now he goes among the Apostles the disciples that had been with Jesus the same one that had knocked him off his horse and now he goes down among them and they don't trust him they they they they don't want to they don't want to have anything to do with it they thought it was a trap they thought it was a trick and the Romans and the Jews were going to get all them together in one place and just take him and arrest them now the Jews when they heard what Saul was doing they said put a hit team out on that guy we got to take that guy out he's a traitor and so now here's Saul and he's going among the disciples and he's trying to talk to them and he can see they're hesitant he can see the fear amongst them he said what's the wrong with you I thought you believed in Jesus don't you believe in justification I've been justified don't you believe in sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's me it's happened to me I'm one of you my life has been changed I'm not the man that I used to be and so he goes and he tries to preach in the synagogue's he but it doesn't work doesn't work and the Apostles finally said hey you know you you need to go away and they sent him away and he goes to Arabia goes to the desert God loves to send his men to deserts like he sent Moses he sent Joseph to prison he put Daniel in the lion's den he puts all in prison had Peter in prison but God knows what he's doing whenever he puts us through a trial whenever he puts us through a test for a true believer it is a predestinated test no trial no sickness can get to you before it goes through God God has to approve that before it comes to you and with that kind of confidence no matter what we go through testing trial challenge whatever it is if we've got the right attitude if we've got the right perspective on life there's nothing that's going to be able to stop us it's like brother Homer said there's something in us that keeps driving us we're unstoppable we're unmovable we're unbreakable when I first came into the message I was excited I was excited when I got saved in a Baptist Church you know one thing I want to say about the Baptist the Baptist they don't have any problem praying for the sick as long as they don't get well they and so I was the best little Baptist that you could be and then I went from the Baptist to the Assembly of God you want to talk about excited filled with the Holy Ghost now and somebody priests Ephesians six to me about the principalities and the powers and the rulers an evil spirit I said you mean there's a war going on a spiritual warfare they're after me and I've got weapons I've got the weapons of my warfare I've got the helmet of salvation breastplate of righteous loins Girt about and so it changed my life it made me a warrior then I went away to Bible School then to the United Pentecostal church commonly referred to as the underprivileged children and so now I get excited the more I go the more light that I see the more excited that I get and then I come to the message now I'm intoxicated at a level I cannot even begin to experience and I go to the first message church and they were living in the Land of Nod the preacher said something I'm standing I'm sitting on the front row you can ask brother Wes I have never sat anywhere except the front row the front row in it I want to be at the spot where the glory comes out I don't want anybody getting my blessing and now we got young people in the church and I got to get there a half hour early for my seat it's a challenge for these guys they come there and they take their Bible and they park it on my seat eight years old ten years I got brother nice eat and they laughed the thing they think is good so I just take their Bible and I put it behind my back and I move over to my seat and they come back there look for where's my Bible I said hey here you go brother so now we got a we got a whole new army of people that want to be at the front row and so now when I was at that first church excited and they were saying well you know he's just excited just got all that enthused he says he's kind of like one of those norman vincent peale kind of guy you know he'll cool off after a while well I never cooled off I mean listen this message this message is the only thing in the world that sounds like it's too good to be true and yet we cannot even plumb the depths of how good it is what God has done for us brother Branham said when the bride fully realizes who she is then we'll be gone it's it has to be a crickety I believe there has to be another super quickening for us to become that super church that super race of people realizing that we've got God's DNA inside of us God's genetic code inside of us we got that royal blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins inside of us it's it's it's a blood that can defeat any enemy brother branham's at any time you can defeat the devil any time in any situation all you got to do is stand you know if I stand the devil can't make me raise my devil can't make me do anything people say the devil made me do no devil never made you do brother Bram said the devil never got on your ground you were not good on his ground and that's where we get into the problem areas in our life so Saul now he's doing everything he can to convince the disciples of the reality of his conversion how frustrating that must have been for a man with his desire and the potentials that he had inside of him and the disciples supposed to have supernatural insight and discernment they couldn't know this can't be true you know I mean he know Jesus is good the Gospels good the Holy Ghost is good but him him no no way not him not after what he's done do you think that didn't that didn't stay with Saul all of his life how he had cast down memory cast down imagination cast down cast down everything that he had previously done all that he had been a part of so now he goes to Arabia and it's give you a little illustration I'll get a chair so Saul you go he goes to Arabia and he sits down mmm and it takes all the scrolls and he starts reading you know that 714 prophecies of Messiah in the Old Testament and being a man like Saul you had to have the whole Torah memorized so Saul goes in there and he starts reading and maybe while he was in that room maybe Jesus walked around in his brain but he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity chastisement of his peace upon us by His stripes we're so now salt for three years sits there it's real oh god what are you gonna use me and finally after three years Barnabas and him they get hooked up and at this time there is a problem they have in real serious issue when who's that for a minute brother says there's real serious issues in Jerusalem and Saul he gathers up resources and brings them to Jerusalem he wants to be a blessing and he's received in the beginning everybody was happy to see him but then they found out do you know who that guy is the one who's coming in here pretending to be a Good Samaritan that's all that's that's the guy that we hired to wipe out these Christians now the Jews they get a garis they get a squadron of soldiers to get them and and the Christians they don't know what to make of him they still are not convinced but he keeps preaching keeps preaching keeps preaching now while he's preaching the Jews are so enraged and the believers are so and they don't what to do so there's a riot taking place and so that Centurion comes down looks out there what's going on and they see seasons it's out of control so he has his guys grab Saul and he puts him into a place he said what's going on so everyone says this one one says that one so finally he takes him into a safe place and that the Jews come and we need that guy that guys are black you don't know the problem that you know he ever he ever heard the word ringleader in the Bible or Saul they said he's the ringleader he's the ringleader of this sect of the Nazarenes causing chaos in all of our synagogue and we want peace we want peace in the province and this man he needs to be dealt with and we need to deal with him and so now he keeps him he keeps him away and then Saul when he gets a chance let me speak to him again and Saul gets up there and he wants to bless them again now they're so angry the end result is 40 men took a vowel we're not gonna eat we're not gonna drink until that man is dead wonder what happened those guys brother Sam and so now there's a truck they set a trap now and they come in they said well you know we want to speak to that fella not anything bad we just want to speak you know things about himself and the things about what he believes meanwhile they got they got the whole squadron of all these these Jews or laying weight ready to trap him and Saul's sisters son Saul's nephew he hears about this plot so he goes to see the Centurion and and they let us didn't let him see him the centauri Amir's him he verifies it's true and then Saul he gets an escort two hundred soldiers threescore and ten a horseman and then a whole bunch of spearmen I think altogether those that I know is over 500 maybe over six-hundred escort that Saul got on the road to protect him from the ploy God knows how to protect his own so now Saul he gets there and yes he has a lot of great experiences he's gotten Liberty he's gotten freedom he has won the people over they see his nature they see his character and so everything is you know he's still imprisoned but everything is going you know kind of okay and then he has to get on a boat and he goes on the boat and the boat it comes into an incredible storm a horrible storm and and these men the sailors that they're fasting 14 days brother Tom they never had a bite of food and they're just trying they're doing everything they can throw in cargo overboard and Saul brother Bram talks about him down in the belly of the ship he said is his hands and his arms all callous from the chains that that had that it held there's this holy prophet and the angel of the Lord appears to Saul he says Saul all will be well no life will be lost 276 Souls on that boat Saul says he goes up there he says no souls will be lost but the ships gone she ain't gonna make it well how do you know all these thing he said the God that I serve had appeared to me and he has assured me that all will be well but the soldiers they were not ready to believe it and they're still throwing stuff overboard and finally it comes to a point where they've got to take drastic action they threw out the anchors and they finally decide to go in and ditch the boat in this little play but before they do one of the soldiers say hey we can't let these prisoners live what if they escape we got to kill them all but the Centurion wanting to spare Saul he said no no no no just let everybody on their own let everybody go for themself so here they all go and it's hard whilst or when they got the shore that didn't mean the storm stopped it was still raining it was still cold these guys are soaked to the bone and they find out these people in Malita and their brother the Bible said their barbarous people heathens raw pagans and yet they that they they offer no small kindness to all these people who were shipwrecked so Saul he's building a fire and he picks up a log putting the log on the fire and and a beast of viperous beast comes and fastens on the Saul's hand and he shook it off all these people says he's got to be a murderer you know Karma's got this guy now and they sat there looking at him waiting for him to die and they said after they sat there and waited for him for a long time to die and he didn't die then they said well he's not a murderer he's a god and they wanted to make a god out of Saul so now they have the chief one of the chief people on the island their publicity and he's got a home and they go there and he's got a sick father and saw praise for him and he's healed and then all the people who were sick they all came and saw heal all of them so now acts end but now we can turn to the book of second Corinthians what a man saw was you know I was telling brother Sam yesterday and this would be this would be an alert for all of us coming out in May you know the world thinks that Israel was formed in 1948 we know it's 46 May the seventh the same time the angel of the Lord was walking into that cave to meet brother Branham he said look on the pan-american clock same moment David ben-gurion is signing Israel in as a nation the angel of the Lord comes to brother but the world they think it's 48 because that's when they recognize Israel so now 70 years from 48 is 2018 may 2018 and they have prepared a movie the Vatican only the second time in their history they have ever co-opted with Hollywood people to produce a movie the movie is going to be called Francis a man of his word they're going on I've seen little clip it's from a little trailers they go all around the world on all of his excursion showing the hundreds of thousands of people him and his popemobile all decked out to the nines they show him washing the feet of the homeless people they show him in the prison they show him praying for the little deformed babies you want to talk about the world getting shocked by believing this man is a Superman it's all preparing the way friends for the Beast the false prophet is going to become the bee when he gets kicked you know he doesn't leave heaven or wherever he is he doesn't leave that place willingly he gets booted out and when he gets booted out we get raptured in and when he comes down he needs a body that going to and he finds the body of the false prophet and he becomes the beast you know brother Branham said the Catholic Church is the highest form of spiritualism there is on the face of the earth I was there for nine years in Catholic school seven years as an altar boy people have no ideas of the depth and the wickedness and the deception of that devil and how he's got billions of people around the world thinking he's a holy man so now when he comes down to earth he is angry what he goes in the body of that false prophet becomes a beat he's angry why is he angry the bride is escaped she's gone but I'm gonna get I'm gonna get those foolish virgins and I'm gonna get those 144,000 now I'm gonna get mode I'm gonna get Elijah well you're talking about a you want to talk about a beast on a mission he is a beast on a mission and he fulfills his mission he gets all the foolish virgins he gets a hundred forty-four thousand he gets Moses and Elijah and the world finally somebody has brought some hope a glimmer of hope to bring things back to way they used to be some semblance of normalcy and that's when it's all over for him and we come back from that wedding supper and we come back and the thousand-year millennium reign friends all these signs that we're seeing you know we have tomorrow's headlines today when something happens we just look at it we see huh brother Branham said that here that's fulfillment of prophecy well and I'll tell you friend this movie is not only going to be a boost for the Catholic Church but the religious world as a whole people who are just you know lukewarm president you know you know what a Presbyterian or a Methodist or Lutheran is there's just Catholics that flunk Latin that's all they did they never got the Hail Mary they never got the rosary in the novenas and they never got the scapular they never got all the details and brother Browns are the only thing to figure out is communion and they'll figure that they're gonna figure it out and last year last year the year before Kenneth Copeland you know it's all over the Reformation is over we are now one friends we are the ones upon whom the ends of the earth have come to you know we have an awesome responsibility I heard many of the brothers talk about how blessed we are but Tom said it for how blessed we are but you know we also have a responsibility the definition of responsibility is response ability or having the ability to respond and the question is do we have God's response ability are we responding to the word that has been sent brother Branham says I wonder and anybody when he said it at smoke he said I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with what God has done amongst us in this day are we just coasting lukewarm just you know well you know friends this is not the time this is the midnight hour this is the homestretch for the bride of Jesus Christ if you are ever going to pray now is the time to pray if you're ever going to witness and hold the token over your family now is the time to hold it over your family I was listening last night I was listening about the watchman and God spoke to Ezekiel he said now Ezekiel he said if you go and you warn the people and they don't listen then their blood is not on you but if you don't go and you don't tell them if their bloods on you friends I know and then when I wake up in the morning one of the first thoughts I have as I go about my day and I'm so happy to be able to go about my day for a couple of years I was not able to go about my day for a couple of years I was afflicted with an illness that going from the bedroom to the bathroom it was a challenge in my church and the people that loved me and cared for me you want to talk about a gospel love I've never expected it was so humbling I never wanted to be one who needed and he helped people brought food people took me the doctors took me here took me their love took care of my car clean my house moved me when I had to move to another house friends when you're in need that's when you need to know that you've got a support team around you and the bride of Jesus Christ is the greatest support team and so now here we owe and I wake up in the morning and I say when I go out I have in my mind I probably believe will be to a lot of people I meet for the first time today I will probably be the only Son of God that they ever come in contact with in their entire life and the same for you you may be the only son or daughter of God that they ever come eyeball-to-eyeball with and if you hear God if you see if you just feel just a little quickening or there's are so many wonderful tracks out now you know the one brother Tim Pruitt's church is done on the the knowledge of the tree of good and evil I have passed that out like it's like they were candy I used to give candy to the kids you know and then the mother said we don't pay the dentist's bill brother Ernie and so now I just passed out tracts and you know I've only had two people ever give me that track back the other four four of them they got a revelation right away when they read the book several of them are still looking at it and only two said no this is not for me but the way that they lay it out they got a beautiful introduction and then they lay out the scriptures question question question question scripture scripture question a person I don't think me rude a person is either got to be stuck in stupid or deep and dumb to be able to read that tract and not be able to see that it that it was that what happened there you know the brother who witnessed to me he's a big old guy brother Arnie big old guy and when he first came to the message big ol Italian fella you know he would have been a good mafia hit man I mean he was great and I think you know him brother home or brother West knew him and but you know what he would go to witness the people he say now look he he did he didn't he couldn't take scripture in place he said you look right here see that Genesis 3 he said look he said you know that wasn't no Apple on that tree it was sex and you know it put on your big-boy pants you think you know something about God well naturally it wasn't the best way to witness the people it's an old saying that said people don't care how much you know until they know how much you care and it's not so much the matter you cover it's the manner in which you cover the matter that makes all the difference I'll give you illustrate if a man and the wife are sitting down having a romantic dinner and the husband says you know honey when I look at you when I look in your eyes it just seems like time stands still that would be nice right what if he said your face could stop a clock you said the same thing but you're going to get two very different reactions P and so we got to be sweet when we present this word this is sweet fresh manna that we're delivering to people and so now after this let's turn to 2 I don't even know who my glasses are that I drop them down there anywhere Sam well I found my watch now I got my glasses okay we're a good and in the second second Corinthians and we're going to start reading at chapter 9 no I'm sorry sorry chapter 11 and we're going to start reading with the first verse now by this time Saul he has been through some trials he's out there you know he's evangelizing he's pioneering churches and you know he did not have an easy go of it think of the people that Saul had to deal with first of all he had the Jews that were semi converted from Judaism and they're trying to see Messiah so that may be like their the the Messiah you know the Jesus for cry she's pews for Jesus kind of Greipel you know and they're halfway in but still holding to all their custom then you got the raw Hagar the pagan heathens they don't know anything about God and so they're all coming together in a house church and the Jews are who you mean I got a fellowship with these rats and and and and so so Paul had to deal with this he had to bring them together had to have that agape love then we look at at Galatian in Galatians or argue about who's got the better gifts who's more spiritual and then we look at Ephesians and and the church has kind of grown too mature the book of Ephesians it may be the most profound book in the entire Bible when it comes to a relationship between God and man but now Saul he's still he's still in early early trials and Saul now he says word to God you would bear with me a little in my folly now the message I'm only gonna be a little while but the message I want to drop today is a fool for Christ okay now Paul gives the first time he mentions it word to God you would bear with me a little in my folly on in my foolishness and indeed bear with me for I am jealous over you with godly jealousy and I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ I remember back in 88 I heard brother Bisco he say now unless the human language has lost every bit of meaning Eve was not chaste and she was not a virgin he said but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your mom should be should be corrupted from the simplicity that's in Christ for if he come preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another spirit which he had not received or another gospel which we have not accepted you might well bear with him but I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest of apostles and then he admits but though I am rude in speech you imagine what it must have been like for Saul the Pharisee to preach first Corinthians thirteen the love chapter one of the greatest books ever who were greatest chapters of any time ever and God had to speak that through saw what a transformation had to take place so he said for though I may be rude in speech yet not knowledge but we have been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things now we drop down to verse 13 and he's talking about the the people who come into the church he said for such a false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light therefore it is no great thing if his Satan's ministers are transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works now so he starts again he says now he said I say again let no man think me a fool if otherwise yet as a fool receive me that I may boast myself a little now listen to this Paul says that which I speak I speak it not after the Lord soul says the Lord didn't tell me to say this the Lord didn't tell me to do this but as it were foolishly in this confidence of boasting saul is saying i should not have to do this you should have received me you know my life you know my nature you know my character you know what I've been through I should not have to even tell you these things that which I speak I speak not after the Lord but as it were foolishly in this confidence of boasting seeing that many glory after the flesh I will glory also for you suffer fools gladly seeing yourselves are wise a little bit of sarcasm there you suffer fools but you guys are all smart you guys know it all you got the message all figured out not talking about you I'm something other people Paul was talking to for you suffer fools gladly seeing yourself a wise for if you suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour you if a man take of you if a man exalt himself if a man smite you on the face and again he goes back he said I speak as concerning reproach as though we had been weak howbeit were and so ever any is bold and in parentheses Paul says I speak foolishly I shouldn't be saying this I shouldn't be humbling myself I shouldn't have any you heard about the guy he prayed for 10 years Eyre was he wanted to be humble after ten years while he was praying he said Lord I think I've done it I think I'm humble and God said now you're guilty of pride so Paul is saying he's saying here for you suffer fools gladly if you suffer a man bring into bondage from and devours a man take of you if a man exalt themselves if a man smite you on the face I speak his concern a reproach as though we had been weak howbeit we're and so ever any is bold I speak foolishly I am bold also are they Hebrew I just hear Paul speed are they Hebrews so am i sometimes we read this we tell are they Hebrew so a mileage no no take some take take take and read try to imagine what Paul was saying while he was read are they Hebrew so a mine are they Israelites so am i are they the seed of Abraham so am I are they ministers of Christ again he says I speak as a fool but I know I shouldn't be doing this I don't want to do it I hate doing it but I got to do it I think ministers of Christ I speak as a fool I am more in Labour's more abundant in stripes above measure five times Paul got 39 lashes on his 195 lashes from these torturous monsters that took that Roman whip with the lictors the little lead balls at the end of it and they crack that whip and they pulled it back and those lead balls went right into the flesh rip the flesh Bruhl out everywhere xxx I don't believe a man today I don't care how strong he is or how in shape I don't believe a man could take a hundred and ninety-five lashes today like Saul did so he said five times received by forty stripes save one thrice I was beaten with rough that couldn't have been easy beaten with rods three times once was i stoned they had a rock party and they killed Saul and they left him under the rocks and they left and God raised up Saul he brushed himself off check this itinerary Marsh right on to the next city Saul a fool a fool for Christ a knight in a day I have been in the deep in journeyings often in perils of water and perils of robbers in perils by mine own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethren in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst Paul was a homeless man for most of his life after he got converted he didn't have the Rose the Rose peddled beds to go and laid he didn't have 5-star Hotel he didn't even have a motel 6 of goats that would have been like the Taj Mahal for him in watchings often in hunger Thor in fastings often in cold and nakedness those Roman jails they were designed for torture they were designed to make somebody as uncomfortable as possible besides those things that are without Nepal saying besides everything I'm going through in my flesh mentally and emotionally everything in the natural realm besides all that besides those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches here's a prophet a prophet messenger his ministry is to the Gentile church around the world and so he has to go through all that physical torture and at the same time he's worried about corinth worried about Galatia worried about it worried about all the false bread that all the wolves that are going in spreading false doctrine about Paul's message who is weak and I am NOT weak who was offended and I burn not if I must needs glory I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities when saw when they had that there's this garrison of a people looking to kill him Saul says the God and father of our Lord Jesus which is blessed for evermore Noah that I lie not in Damascus the governor under arethis the king kept the city with a garrison desirous to apprehend me and through a window in a blanket a basket I was let down by the wall and escaped his hands think of there was all points bulletin out for Saul they wanted to kill him that they they couldn't do it fast enough it couldn't be bad enough couldn't be bloody enough they wanted to rip this guy limb from limb if they had ever got a hold of him and now for for our last scripture if we can turn over to Philippians in chapter 3 verse 1 I'm just going to read quickly save time finally my brethren rejoice in the Lord to write the same things to you sorry finally my brother rejoicing the lord to write the same things to you to me indeed is not Grievous but for you it is safe beware of dogs beware of evil workers beware of the concision that means taking the message and splicing the message you know taking a little using the message for a smorgasbord pick out what you like and leave what you don't like beware beware of the concision for we which are of the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Jesus Christ and have no confidence in the flesh though I might have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinking that he whereof he might trust in the flesh I more and again soul he has to he has to boast a little bit circumcised the eighth day of the stock of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin an Hebrew of the Hebrews and touching the law a Pharisee considering zeal persecuting the church touching righteousness which is the law blameless think about how radical he was to keep the law every jot every tittle probably had those phylacteries those scriptures all around is his arms and his legs everywhere he went a check Isaiah said to see everywhere he went he was like a walking talking buck well you know what a believer you are a walking talking supernatural encyclopedia that's who you are and people who try to tell you this whole earth came about by the big bang I say you really believe that if you believe that the Big Bang cause every species and men to be created you would believe I could take a stick of dynamite and throw it into a print shop and I would come a dictionary their minds are gone the the world is insane spiral it's insanity on steroids our country is on the verge of a civil war not a racial civil war a political civil war and there are people who are designed to take our country down if only they could take one man down we know the man that's in the office is the man God put in that office just like the last man was enough he was designed to put to bring America to the state she was in but those things don't don't concern us friends we're concerned with another kingdom a never-ending Kingdom wherefore God as also highly exalted him and given him I'm sorry and be found in him not having this is verse 9 and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Jesus the righteousness which is of God by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection let's stand to our feet friends that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained either we're already perfect but I follow after it that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehend of Jesus Christ finally he says brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do and I trust that each one of us when we walk out this door we can take this scripture this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind you ought to forget them because God already forgot them why should we remember them if God can't remember them if we are like God's we can forget them we can forget our brothers Falls our brothers of mistakes we can forget all those things forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth under the things which are before I press forward to the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus the the phrase that I love Paul said I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ let's bow our heads father we thank you for how you have allowed us to see the first prophet messenger and all the things that our prophet messenger said about him the greatest missionary the world has ever known what a life what a zeal what a character Lord he had one thought one desire and that was heaven and to bring as many people as he could with him father and here you have come again and you have with your messenger in this day as he said even in one meeting one meeting that he held Jesus did more miracles in one meeting than is recorded in the entire Bible how not for the press is how numb how dull how desensitized the church has gotten over the years but not the Bride of Christ she's on fire she's blazing a trail of glory she's living she's going to be so much like Christ that people are going to be able to sense that atmosphere since that anointing when we walk into the room Father I pray I thank you for this meeting and for all that have gathered and many have come many many miles that have many miles to return I pray Lord that something was said that will refresh them on the way Lord I'm just so thankful to be a son of God I just wanna I just want to say brother Sam and his church have been so so good to me and brother JT and brother Tom and for
