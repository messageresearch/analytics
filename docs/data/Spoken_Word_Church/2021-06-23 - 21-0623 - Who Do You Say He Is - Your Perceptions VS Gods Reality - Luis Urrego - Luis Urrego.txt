that holy spirit is in you you know it's not it's not just you it's it's the holy spirit in you makes you holy amen so uh it's not the holy mountain is the god in the mountain because god is there amen so it's god in you and and you know when we look at each other and the way we treat one another amen it's the way we treat god exactly man it's the way we we look at god so what a important thing in this hour good to be in the house of the lord amen and um just appreciate each and every one of you and thank you brother dale for the opportunity to uh say something to to you all from the from the word um y'all remember us in your prayers uh this this week uh i'll be ministering on friday it'll be through a zoom but uh be ministering on friday to the believers in costa rica i've ministered to them before last october so i'll be ministering to them again um next uh next friday um brother royal soriano will be ministering to them as well and i'll be interpreting so so uh so we'll be uh we're looking forward to that because that's actually the first time that brother royal soriano me and brother royal we we've talked about him may taking him to central america and south america mexico or something like that uh from the from the philippines and uh and maybe this is his little ticket to get in too so but the brother didn't uh the brother eric chacon who's the pastor there in costa rica he he was the one who asked me he said brother luis can you be the bridge to connect me to brother soriano i know about him i just i'd love to meet him we got to talking last night i was on a zoom call with them for about an hour or so and uh and uh got to meet and really enjoyed one another and so uh we're looking forward to that and also remember us in your prayers this sunday we'll be ministering in beaufort south carolina there brother samuel not hit us so you just remember us in prayer as we travel amen amen that the lord are just blessed how many love the lord amen amen praise god i know you didn't come to hear me you come to hear something from god so let's just go straight to the word this this afternoon and let's turn to matthew 16. matthew 16. let's start at verse 13. and i want to talk this afternoon about who do you say that he is and i want you to make that that a personal question to you but as i guess as a little subtitle i guess let's talk about also your perceptions versus god's reality amen we're going to take a look at that perceptions versus reality because uh sometimes i think in our perceptions we make our perceptions our reality and in reality it isn't we think that they are but they're not especially if they're not based out uh from the word of god the word of god should be the reality over all realities because he is and he is the creator of all things and so he's he's our absolute brother branham said right so we should base everything upon the word of god amen that should be our final standard amen in a christian's life amen so let's let's just read this matthew chapter 16. starting at verse 13 it says when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do man say that i the son of man am right and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elias and others jeremiah's or one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon bar barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven amen and i say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against him and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus christ amen so let's just bow our heads this afternoon you pray for me and i just remember all the requests that we have amongst us and uh let's just go to the lord and pray our heavenly father we thank you lord for the opportunity to open back the pages of your word and father god we know lord jesus that without revelation lord jesus these would just be empty words in a in a page father but lord we ask that these these words would just pop lord to us and reveal them to us father god make us lord jesus uh draw closer to you lord god know in our position father god as sons and daughters of god here lord representing you lord in this wicked hour that we live in lord we thank you meet every need that's amongst us father for we certainly have many lord god that that are sick many they're having maybe even financial problems whatever the needs may be lord you know every situation and you knew it even before the foundation of the world and best of all lord you know how to take care of it lord god so we just committed all unto you and we just commit ourselves unto you father in jesus christ's name amen amen you may be seated this afternoon i'll do my best to not keep you all along this this evening um i just wanted to also mention i forgot to mention this uh uh this week that i've been talking to brother soriano and uh and he says greetings to each and every one of you all and just remember him in prayer amen um but uh just interesting how how you would think that you know in the last year um there's they're having they have not been able to have church services like like they should like like they were accustomed to have and just things you know and they're still i mean they're still pretty much heavily locked down just like our neighbors up north are right now um just like it's still 20 20. and and uh so but uh he told me he said that uh even though that they've had this pandemic and everything going on there's been five churches that have come out out of the pandemic amen five churches right uh just just out of uh of him um you know he's been ministering through zoom through the zoom calls and things like that and of course the the other assistant ministers helping out as well but out out of that i don't know how it happened we didn't get it he didn't get to tell me all the details but he said there's been about five churches come out of the man so it's interesting how god does that so you think you think you know the bible definitely does it says all things work together for good so you think something when something is for bad there's there's god doing something else on the behind the scenes and uh if there wasn't this pandemic there wasn't this lockdown to shut down over there maybe these people would not have been able to come out so these churches might not have been able to spring up so i just wanted to share that with you good to just kind of excite us a little bit amen like god's still working amen in the world he's definitely working out there in in in in that area that's right definitely if the brother could if the brothers in the back could just pull up the the first picture i want to start off with this i hope they were able to get the pictures um all right so we want to we want to just play a little game for just a moment now i want you all to see uh uh see what you see and just let you just you we all have seen these things and i want to see what what you see so how many sees uh a man playing a saxophone how many sees uh uh a woman's face okay does every everybody sees pretty much both things all right all right next all right here's another one right here um see if you can find the elephant's legs it's hard right because they're blending in with the back with the backdrop so it's really uh it's an optical illusion it's playing with your mind and the fact that i know it's playing with your mind is because some of you looked at it and started chuckling so go ahead next all right how many sees a young woman looking over do you see also the old the older lady i'll give y'all just a moment got it you got it all right it took me a while to see the older lady but i finally got to see it there there's there's the older leg the chin there's the nose mouth but then there's a profile of a side view of a woman young woman looking to the side but you have to look hard right you have to see things that wasn't exactly the way you thought it was at first right so there's a neck next how many sees a duck duck head how many sees a rabbit head yep you see both what stood out to me first was the duck but then then then i saw the rabbit next but the rat there's the rabbit ears and there's the the mouth next all right and who sees the vase and you see the two faces as well yeah all right you all are so smart praise the lord [Laughter] amen and i think there's one more one more i wanted to show y'all who are these are are those moving when you look at them are they moving sure yeah yeah but they're not moving it's just your mind is interpreting like this if they're moving but you know that they're not moving so this is what's called an optical illusion and uh we'll say we'll save the next let's see what's next brother i think that's it for now okay we'll just stop it there that is what you call an optical illusion and uh and so it it in reality it isn't what you think it is amen and so and so i wanted to just kind of show that to you to just um to just let you know hey your brain sometimes plays tricks on you and uh but god has given us those types of things amen to also be for survival purposes as well right in it on this earth especially you know we he's given us the five senses the sea taste hear smell uh feel um in order for us to contact this world amen amen um and and we need that to survive amen but at some point in our lives at some point in time amen we have to go beyond the five senses amen right we have to go beyond the five sentences a christian with the holy ghost amen in their life god dealing in their life god wants to train his children amen to look beyond just what you're seeing or just what you're hearing just what you're tasting or just what you're feeling amen because god is a god that needs to be believed by faith it needs to be taken by faith and that's the hard part for us as human beings because we don't see taste feel or smell him amen and you could yeah we know brother brother daley he has a testimony where he said he smelled god in the woods amen i believe that amen i believe that he can make himself uh uh in that way to us amen and he can show himself a man even uh in in the form of a light we see it uh and in the pillar of fire that was even photographed there as we showed the picture there just a moment ago but i wanted to make a comment there about that picture if the brothers could bring that up real quick in 19 i believe was 1953 when that was photographed or 52 52 somewhere there in the early 50s and and it's interesting how god allowed for that to be photographed a supernatural being who by the way all the illusions that i just showed you all the the people around the world who talk about supernatural this they talk about uh i saw a ghost here and this that or the other and they're all into aliens and all this kind of stuff but yet they've never heard of that picture we've never seen that picture nobody i've never heard anybody on tv or a documentary ever talking about that picture and to me to me it seems like it's just satan trying to hide it from the people because he knows it's real man he knows it's true and he won't give you a man the uh truth he won't really uh i mean when he does tell you a lie he does give you 99 truth amen but i just wonder why this isn't all out there the way we think it should be right amen but you see a a supernatural being was photographed amen and that's the pillar of fire uh over brother branham's head there and it's amazing and how god timed to for this photograph to be taken at this time when there was no photoshop or anything such right because nowadays if that picture would have been taken nowadays if the prophet was living nowadays people would he said oh that's photoshop that's that that was just added into it but he made sure that that was taken during the time when there was no photoshop there was no maybe there was some sort of editing of images but it wasn't as advanced as it is now right right and and and so uh that it could it could it could be very well said hey that is a and it was not only that but it was also verified by a government agent as well it was the only supernatural being ever to struck the struck the lands they man photographed in that way so that's why i wanted to show that so that for a believer is not an optical illusion amen that should be the truth that should that should be something that you shouldn't be ashamed of either amen yeah right praise god because that is part of what we believe amen amen and and you say oh they tell you oh well you're just worshipping a man you're but see you're looking at the wrong thing you're looking at the wrong thing we're concentrating on this up here amen we're not concentrating on the man and that's where satan tries to distort the thing amen the image amen the reality is is is is this amen amen that that that is just as much real as brother branham once all right amen but to be able to have the the the opportunity to have a picture made with god there you go thank god amen it was the only supernatural being and the world has no idea that it even exists amen but the believers should amen the believers should so amen praise god you can turn that off brothers so i wanted to to talk a little bit about our perception versus our reality and then just see where the lord leads amen so our perception does not necessarily mean that it's it's our reality amen the word perception means the way of regarding understanding or interpreting something or a mental impression that's what the word perception means it's the way you understand how something is right it's the way you for you think i i i i i i i in and if we're not careful that then could become our a reality if you don't have a balance to it you see then then then the then the word reality means this is the definition of the word reality means the world or the state of things as they actually exist right existence that is absolute self-sufficient or objective and not subject to human decisions or conventions in other words there's no dispute in it right it's there it is what it is amen that's reality right and when and and when you when they tell you you know uh when a few years ago when reality tv or reality tv shows came out those who who who watch tv when reality tv is coming out you don't even have to have a tv you just they got it on netflix they got it on all that now and uh but they made you think oh this is real tv and it was just as fake as any other fake show there is because and you look kind of look at some of the scenes they show and things like how in the world can they can they at the moment be able to to to to film that specific uh uh uh time or that specific event obviously something staged somewhere amen so so but perception i want you to listen to this perception occurs totally in the mind and can turn any belief into reality yeah right think about that anything that you perceive that it that that this microphone amen i may think it's something else but you you you might think it's something else but i say it's a microphone amen my perception of it amen or my perception or whatever it is in your mind amen can become a reality to you amen praise god and like i said earlier the perception needs to use your five senses in order to contact what it is amen to construct that reality for you so for example you might have touched something or you might have tasted something in the past and and now you know that whenever you smell that cologne nowadays it takes you back to something a reality that you experienced or something or or or a taste takes you back amen oh when you were a child back in such and such a place you see right amen it evokes emotions amen and so what what are those five senses we've just mentioned they will see taste hear smell and touch now now listen to this perception is not reality right all right people uh there's there's a thing out there that says that perception is reality but perception is not reality perception can become a person's reality because perception has a strong influence on how we look at reality so there is a difference see your perception of how you see someone that's that is your reality i may not see that person the way you see it right do you see what i'm trying to say now i'm trying to bring it to what what peter had what jesus had asked peter who do man say that i the son of man and exactly amen amen see sometimes amen you might think oh that person gets on my nerves but i have no problem with that person right because i have not had the experience maybe that you've had right but that doesn't make your perception of that person the reality or the proof of the standard right it doesn't that's right there is a reality and that's that person let's go talk to that person let's go see what that person is like then we'll we'll both know what the reality is like then you see right praise the lord amen and see perception but perception is really it acts as a lens through which we view reality see the way we perceive something it acts as the lens you know the way the way if i had a telescope with the lens you know it's it's this is the the what's making me see how brother wade is but if that perception if that lens is distorted in some way or another if it has gone through some sort of tragic experience and in your life and back or or something has happened that lens can be distorted and makes it makes it seem like that's the reality in reality it's not do you see what i'm saying so that's why saints as christians amen we have to be careful of how we judge one another of how we look one at one another or how we think of one another amen because let me tell you what satan is is is he's a master of of of changing the perceptions of people i mean that's what he does if he does it out there in the world then all you got to do is turn on cnn and i'd say don't turn it on turn on fox news turn on all these uh uh all these media outlets and you'll realize that they are masters at changing the way you think and they've done this amen for many years but we've seen it rampant amen especially in this last year right through social media through they can they can turn you off at any moment they want to if you're not going by their narrative that's right amen they're masters at changing perception amen praise god last year we were hearing about corrode and virus numbers around this time we don't hear about it anymore it's something different now so you're not even thinking about the numbers anymore you're not even looking at the chart anymore the chart where is that chart by the way no no but see in the philippines they still are right in the philippines they think right here in america we are going through all this asian hate that's going on in the media that people are beating up asians and stuff like that they think that that's going on around here in america yeah but we know that's not the reality right right but in the philippines they think oh my goodness you guys must i don't want to go to america right now and i i tell the brother brother there's nothing going on down here it's don't believe what the media tells you don't believe everything they tell you you and me no different right you and me know the reality amen you see amen praise god but saints that is why even though our lens amen our lens of perception might be distorted amen that's why god tells us amen to look at look through the lens of his holy spirit amen because looking through the lens of the word amen right brother the the word is never distorted the word is never incorrect the word is never crooked the word never has damage in it and you will always be able to look at something exactly the way it needs to be looked at amen amen and it is not your opinion it's not my opinion it's it's what god said and that's what matters do you want to help somebody even out there in the nominal world amen you want to help somebody don't give them your opinions your common ground that you have with them is the word amen right you will help somebody amen with the word but don't give them your opinions because they can't they can't receive that amen something will tell them hey that's your perception of things that's right but when you show it in the word there's no way to deny that it's in the word amen and if you believe that god said what he said in his word and that this is his word amen there's no way amen to say i can't believe that amen amen praise god so we need the lens of the holy spirit to help us look and judge things the right way now i said judge amen amen remember that jesus said judge not lest ye be judged that's right amen i'm going to repeat that again judge not lest ye be judged and and and in matthew chapter seven and just read here real quick and and i wanted to read this for the benefit of our young people as well amen through the um uh con it's the contemporary english version so it's just that you would understand a little bit much easier it says don't condemn others and god won't condemn you god will be as hard on you as you are on others he will treat you exactly as you treat them you can see the speck in your friend's eye but you don't notice the log in your own eye that's this is our just jesus own words how can you say my friend let me take the speck out of your eye when you don't even see the log that's in your own eye how can i help brother dale with something amen when i need help myself that's right man i'm not going to be able to see right to help him amen with whatever if i got something that's blocking my way you're nothing but show-offs that's what verse 5 says you're nothing but show-offs first take out the log take the log out of your own eye and then you can see how to take the speck out of your friend's eye amen jesus own words now you can go back and read it pretty much says the same thing um uh in the king james version amen and then first corinthians chapter four verse five says therefore judge nothing before the time right right amen until the lord come who both will bring the light to light the hidden things of darkness and we'll make manifest the councils of the hearts and then shall every man have praise of god amen so we have no business judging one another let god do the judging right amen we have we have no business you have your opinion that's fine that's perfectly fine but don't let it be the reality and don't let that be the reality amen to just share with others and say that that yeah that's how i see it this way and that's how no right amen let god be the judge of that because i believe that's the christian attitude right you agree with that praise the lord amen i mean i the reason why i was looking into this because this week i was i was listening there was a video that came online some of you all may have seen it it's by a a man he's it's a black man his name was is ty smith i believe is his last name and he was um talking to a group of parents at a at a school board meeting and he was telling them about how he totally disagreed with what what you might have heard in the media about critical race theory and it's a big thing that pretty much is is pushing your children to be racist that's pretty much what is what is doing in the name of not being racist right it hides behind this that's what blm and all these groups do they hide behind that we're not racist but yet but yet there's there's there's uh there's a communism behind it you know that that that's that's it's wrong it's evil and uh but anyways so ty smith and i thought my goodness that that what he had to say i thought that was that was that was good but he told he told a story of an experience that he had when he was a little kid in elementary school and he said when i was in elementary school i played with all my friends i had i had white friends i had hispanic friends i had i had black friends you know everybody was my friend kids don't think the way sometimes we think amen and i'm so thankful that they they don't my man they're they're innocent they're pure amen but this as we get older man we start thinking that we're better than somebody else and and that's when you need the holy ghost amen but he said until they started going to lunch now at the lunch because he couldn't afford they couldn't afford to to take lunch to school so uh there was the kids that could afford to take lunch to school um so they had their own sack lunches and their lunch box pretty lunch box and things like that and they got to go you know they lined them up first you know and then they said he said now i had a ticket you know to get free lunch at school and so he the teacher would say the teacher was just told to do these things it wasn't even her fault i was told to go to the back of the line and it wasn't just because of his skin color it was just if you had the ticket you know because you were getting school lunch right so anybody who had the ticket and he said that because of that he started looking at all his other friends that he would play on the playground with and he would have no problems with until lunch came around he'd start looking at him in the wrong way yeah so those kids didn't have no idea what was going on they were just obeying the the the teachers orders as well so the the kid those kids would be eating lunch and they would wave high at thai and and he'd look at him in the wrong way because he thinks that they're making fun of making fun of him yeah because they're over there like ah we got to go first and and you didn't get to go that was his perception of the the reason they were saying hello to him and so uh he was being mean to them uh because he thought that they were being mean to him but see they and so they now they had distorted perceptions and so now those those kids who got to go first in the lunch line they would go to the teacher and say uh teacher tai is being mean to me and so the teacher would go to the to tie and say well what now ty why why are you being mean to him and he could not explain what was going on he couldn't explain well i don't want to hang out with them anymore i don't want to be around them they'd be they'd go to to to recess and everything and there was just that tension nothing that he did nothing that those other kids did nothing not even the teacher it was just a whole situation that was put on them that changed the perception of everybody's perception right he later realized what it was of course you know he matured and he's a he's a preacher he's a minister now i thought that was an excellent example of how satan plays with one another in such ways that you're perceiving such a brother this way because he said this or you're perceiving such a sister that she said this or i heard that she thought this of you or this that or the other let me tell you what that is the point right there when you need to nip it in the butt amen nip it in the butt and just get rid of and satan get the behind me and stuf and that thing will just get get taken care of amen don't play around with it amen don't let satan amen get a full hold of that thing because let me tell you it'll run rampant all over the church amen and then you realize we'll be all looking at one another amen and wondering what's going on and we realize satan is just in our middle amen just tripping us all up amen the bible says amen we fight not flesh and blood but but but powers and principalities amen spirits amen they're in there we don't fight one another amen we fight satan amen amen when jesus told this uh peter he said when when peter was telling him no you're not going to the cross or he he rebuked peter amen he rebuked satan he said get thee behind me satan but it was it was because satan was using his brother amen was using peter amen it wasn't necessarily for peter amen he knew satan was behind that amen praise god so we got to realize amen what causes amen sometimes tensions amongst us it's not one another it's satan amen and satan and and saints it's too late of the hour saints amen too late in the hour amen for us to to be uh uh just playing around with these things amen and just letting satan just do whatever amen such and such i hear this this i heard this that and the other oh look what such and such person is doing on on instagram look at what such a person is doing on facebook look where they're going today amen hey man let's just let god handle it right and we'll look here in just a moment as something an example of of of a story here in perception amen praise god now uh so i thought that story was pretty interesting about ty smith now look what brother brown says here that um in regards to we've got to look at things through the lens of the word of god amen brother braham says here in the in in the message a guide in 1962 he says the god has understanding how to go and what to do amen god god has always sent a god to his people god has never failed amen he sends a guide but you've got to accept that guy see see you've got to believe it you've got to go the way he says if you get into a wilderness or in the woods and your god says we got to go this way and you and yet you think you go that way uh uh you you're going to come up lost in other words if you think that you there's another way to to make it you're going to come up lost then when god sends us a god to us we've got to follow that god no matter what we think what looks reasonable and what looks ridiculous we're not subjects to divide that the god is the only one amen amen so the god is the holy ghost amen the god is his word to us praise god and it doesn't matter what we think about it what our opinions are that's our perceptions what's the reality because the reality will always trump perceptions amen perceptions is is just your opinions it's not the reality amen praise god so and and and that just goes along with us moving by feelings amen it's so easy to just move by feelings especially our sisters amen it's just easy to move by feelings amen and then when a and we have to learn amen that we got to move amen according to the reality of the word of god amen praise the lord i'm reminded in the bible of the of the story of of of elisha with his servant amen how many remember that right when the syrian army the king was going to try to take over israel and there was a moment where uh the the there was horses everywhere from the syrians surrounding that specific area where elisha and and his servant were there and elisha's servant saw the reality of amen of all these horses and all these all these people all these this army getting ready to attack israel yeah but i like what what uh what what elisha says that we could just read just a few little verses from there and i want us to take something from there he says in second kings chapter 6 verse 15 through 17 you can go home and read the whole story yourself but he says and when the servant of the man of god was risen early and gone forth behold and host compassed the city both with horses and chariots and his servants said unto him alas my master how shall we do in other words what are we going to do and elisha and he answered fear not amen wasn't that the same words that jesus said fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them amen now let's just say if i was elijah's servant and you were right there and elisha was telling me like that and then you look over at her what are you talking about yeah yeah i mean i see all the syrian army around us and you're saying that there's more of us amen than there are of them what in the world right it looked foolish but see his servant was looking through it through the lens of his of his his own perception he saw that that's how things were therefore he thought that that's how they were amen so and in verse 17 it says and elisha prayed and said lord i pray thee open his eyes that he may see right now i i was thinking about us as parents amen when i was reading this because sometimes our children saints those who who have who have children right now that are growing up we can't make them see things on their own right we uh we can't we can't do the work for them right now amen it has to be god to do the work okay man and look elisha is like okay i can't make my servant see this he elisha couldn't do it as much as as much of god that he had in his life as much as the of the power of god that he had in his life yet he could not make his servant see to change his perception of what was going on amen it took prayer amen for him to do it and watch and he says and the lord opened the eyes of the young man amen it was the lord and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire right round the body elisha so you knew amen there was chariots there but they weren't chariots of fire these were chariots of fire after the lord opened his eyes amen he knew then that there was other beings there praise god so you see saints us as parents we could not change our children would they have to come and have their own experience with god the best thing that you and i can do amen is pray for them get down on your knees and pray for them saints and and and watch god amen do the work amen god is the one that can change hearts god is the one that can open the blinded eyes god is the one that can make people see things a different way amen sometimes we can't do it that's fine but we have a god that can make not make any mistake as brother branham said he said that our god amen our god has never failed no amen we cannot do it but he can praise god amen i want to look at another example the woman at the well amen praise god her reality was that she was a prostitute right she had five husbands and she the one that even the one that was she was living with at the moment was not even her husband that was her reality amen and her perception was is that there was no other way for me to live besides this way amen there was no way out of that type of life for her right that was her perception right i mean how sometimes we we think that this is how my life is i don't know if it'll ever change from this this is how i've grown up this is and that is just your perception right you have to realize especially uh us young people young people look at yourself in the in this way god put you here on earth to fulfill his purpose amen so you're not here just to occupy space you're here to fulfill something for him right now whether it whether it's going to be now or whether it's going to be in two years or whether it's going to be in 10 years god knows but you're not here just to be here amen you're here for a purpose amen and god knows exactly all we got to do is get into that lens amen let that lens look through the eyes through the eyes of the word amen in regards to your life and god will show you exactly what you need to do but when we're out doing other things and we're out just paying more attention doing other things more than what we do for god then don't expect for there to be any spiritual changes in your life if if all you're worried about is is something else in your life besides god don't expect for god to increase in your life you see god is going to actually decrease more in your life but when you give more time for god that means god is increasing in your life right and then you will see the results of that praise the lord amen i'm just trying to make it as simple as i can because i i'm a dummy and i have to be taught that way too amen make it simple for me amen praise god but that was the woman at the wells that was her perception amen right and her perception was changed amen when the reality of realities told her all things amen amen remember jesus she told uh jesus she says that when messiah cometh he'll tell us all these things and you know what jesus did that for her and and because jesus did that for her told her all the all these things she ran left her water pot assad and said come see a man who's told me all these things right my brother all things the bible says there that told me all things because see she told jesus that when messiah cometh he will tell us all things right she had that in her life as a foundation because she had heard the word amen do you see you see and i say this to everyone but but but but to our young people don't neglect any part of the word that you may understand in your life no matter how simple it is hold to that hold to that because you see so you see the woman at the well she held to that she she held to that fact that her mom or her dad or a brother or somebody told her hey when messiah comes he will tell us all things and when messiah did come and told her all things of her life that completely changed her man but it had to be the word first the word came forth first to her and she retained that she's no matter what happened in her life no matter how satan destroyed her life the way the way she got she held on to that word amen and that word amen changed her amen so her perception her perception of the way she saw herself do you think it stayed the same i believe it changed from then on amen because the reality of reality is amen kicked in and changed it all for her who's the reality of realities we know it was christ amen praise the lord jesus amen that's right so she had that as that foundation amen now i i want us to understand too that our perceptions of someone determines our relationships with them amen we talked about this just a little bit amen that the way we see somebody is the way we are going to receive them in our life or not or not amen and our perception uh of of of god determines how our relationship with him is as well you see if we you know maybe if i might ask brother dale what do you think of god you know well he might say he might give what he thinks of god you know what what god is to him right my ass zach what god is to you amen he will tell tell me i might ask lord jonas back there what god is to him now he's going to give me what god is to him in in his in his perception but you see there is a reality amen there is a reality of what god is amen right praise god and so whatever you think of what god is is how your relationship with god is going to be right right exactly if you think that if you think like a catholic for example i grew up as a catholic so i had the mentality that if that that god was just an angry god all the time and if i did wrong and if i didn't do the things that i was supposed to do that lightning bolt was just going through that ceiling at any moment and strike me upside the head and i was gonna just be walking around with a crispy head the rest of my day but you know you see that was my perception because of of a past experience of what i was taught of what i was told you see but we know that that's not what god is about right right because i don't see anyone here with crispy head amen god is not a god of of of he's not just a he's a god of judgment we know that he's also a god of love amen amen amen praise god so however you look at god right now is the way is how your your relationship is going to be with him amen so if you look at god as as for example an inviting one an inviting person hey come and i will give you rest right then what are you going to do you're going to come because you see him as an inviting one but if you see him as somebody you better straighten up before you come to me amen and that's how you're going to perceive god that's going to be your relationship with god praise god so and again the it's the same way with a person amen right you see a person a certain way then that's how you're gonna treat be around them that's right right man if i see zach a certain way amen if i look at him a certain way that's how i'm gonna treat him right you see i'm maybe more comfortable with him or not you see but if you perceive somebody a certain way you think oh my goodness they're going to snap at me at any moment you you you kind of back off a little bit you see your relationship is kind of because that's your perception of that person but it just behooves us saying say man to just get to know people get to know people and i tell that to our young people say you know get to know people because people in reality really want to get to know you you see right brother they really do it's not it's not that they they they're they're trying to be standoffish and better than you and stuff like that no right i i always told my girls i said you wanna you wanna have a friend be a friend amen i had to learn that in in in life amen especially as you grow older my mom tells me that when i was younger i was always in the neighbors houses uh and just talking to them and and i was just chitter chatter everywhere as i started getting older i started kind of getting away from that a little bit you see uh uh but then you have to you have to realize well you want to have friends you be friends amen you want to be friends praise god now let's read again matthew chapter 16 verse 13 through 20. and just take a few points from there when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom the man say that i the son of man am amen now you notice that jesus said i the son of man praise god because he was the son of man he always referred to himself as the son of man praise the lord and they said and they said the disciples said because jesus was asking the disciples and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elias and others jeremiahs are one of the prophets now you notice that what they were telling him that people thought of jesus was that jesus was a a was one of these dead men that had already dead and was resurrected and they didn't equivilate jesus with somebody a live living a a present day man that was born in their day what the disciples were telling jesus was that he was a resurrected person that came from the grave amen and he's walking amongst the people equivalating jesus with death think about that all right father amen and he said in jesus verse 15 he saith unto them but but now the people say that but now what do you say in other words what do you think of god he said he said unto them but whom say ye that i am right and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god amen and you see that was a revelation to peter amen praise god in verse 17 and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and nice and i say also unto thee thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it see so now peter had a revelation that this wasn't just a dead man walking amongst us amen this was jesus christ the son of god amen praise the lord and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom verse 19 and who whatsoever thou shalt abide on earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever thou shalt lose on earth shall be loosed in heaven in verse 20 says then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ amen in other words he was telling them not to tell not don't change people's perception of me let them think that that's fine you keep it you keep it to yourself saying eventually they would eventually tell peter will eventually tell people who he really was amen after he received the holy ghost but you see so the people had this perception of jesus but in reality what was jesus jesus wasn't interested really in what the people out there thought of him he really wanted to see what his disciples thought of him amen praise god and so that is that is what god wants us to know saints is what do you think of god amen i mean you some of you have been in this message for for years amen has your perception or has your reality of god has it changed from when it was when you first came in to what it is now right or is it the same thing has nothing changed in your life and just the the little time that that peter was with jesus his perception of jesus changed a lot and that was before the holy ghost at first heath probably peter probably thought that jesus was just a fisherman because that's how he met him because that's why that's what jesus told them hey let let go the net over here toss it to the other other side and he probably thought that hey man this is a master fisherman but then he realized that this is more than just a fisherman this is more than just a fisherman but he kept going amen he kept going amen and and then he realized my goodness this this man is not just a fisherman but he can actually take fish and make a lot more fish out of and not just a lot more fish but it's actually cooked fish and fed about 10 000 people so now peter's perception is growing and changing wow my goodness he's not just a fisherman but he's a creator as well and now his perception changed to a revelation that he is the christ the son of god amen but it took peter amen to continue walking with jesus in order for that to change don't just settle for just your one revelation continue in the gospel continue in the word continue in the reading continuing coming to church continue amen and you will realize that your perception or your revelation that's what we use the revelation of who he is will continue to grow in your life and you will perceive god differently amen you know uh the woman at the well i forgot to mention this she said i perceive that they are a prophet amen right i perceive because my foundation was told to me that hey when the prophet comes he'll tell us all these things share our perception was right it was a reality amen amen brother branham says here he says he said but who do you say it isn't what somebody else says it's what it's what we think it's what you say what's your opinion of it god asks that question to every man here tonight what's your opinion opinion of this thing that's going on is it with the word test it with the word amen peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god praise the lord jesus amen you got to move on with the word saints amen how much time we got let me just mention this real quick and then i'm going to show something else here a little quick little video so don't fall asleep on me yeah yeah we're going to show videos now all right don't fall asleep all right um let's turn to revelations chapter five real quick the brothers didn't get this but i i wanted to i want to show just look at something here real quick revelations chapter five let's just read from verse one through six now this here in revelations chapter five is john amen um looking at the right hand of the one of the of the book that was covered with with which what they were sealed amen and it says there in verse 1 and i saw in the right hand of him this is john now speaking and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals so it was a book that was that was totally sealed it was closed off amen with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof now imagine if you were john and when and when you're looking at this at this panoramic and you're looking at this scene unfolding before your eyes and and you hear this voice of this angel saying who is worthy to open uh the book and to loose the seals thereof because i'm sure that john wanted to know what was in that book my goodness i mean uh if if you ever watched an indiana jones movie and you saw uh what what what if they had a book that was closed with some seals that there was it was it was something that everybody was looking for you know and and and everybody was trying to find and it was like a it was something secret but yet you know needed to be found and we want to know what it was in that book right right well i'm sure john felt the exact same way amen and verse 3 it says and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and i'm sure john was really sad because look what what verse 4 says he says and i wept much in other words i cried a lot because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon amen so no man was worthy on earth in earth anywhere to to open this book to unloose those seals they could not even they could not even touch it not even look upon it the bible says amen they could not even look upon it and he and john got really sad now you put yourself in john's shoes you know would would you have god said i probably would have gotten sad i'm sad my what is it in this book that no man is able to to look upon and one of the elders verse 5 and one of the elders saith unto me now watch this is when see john's perception of things was a certain way see he looked and saw and perceived no man can open this book there's no way and don't satan sometimes does like that to us in our life there is no way that i'm coming out of this no way that i can have victory over this this thing's already sealed in my life and i i grew up this way and this is a curse on my life and and and you know what the seals this book was sealed and yet we know that it was opened later on so god can open up anything in your life amen he can break anything in your life no matter how tight it is how clo how how how hard do you think it might be uh to to get away from right god is more than able amen to open anything amen those seals of your life amen that's right brother praise god and and it says here and one of the elders saith unto me watch weep not don't cry john behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof now john is looking at john is weeping and he's got his perception is that nobody can open the book all of a sudden he hears and one of the elders tells him hey someone the lion of the tribe of judah the lion of the tribe of judah can open the book oh wow so there is building a hope in him right there's a hope building in him now and he knows okay there's a lion now so he's looking for the lion because he heard that there was going to be a lion right right his perception was a lion because that's what he was told but look what verse 6 says and i be held and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb the elder said it was a lion but when he looked when john looked it was a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and watch what this lamb did and he says and what and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book when this lamb took the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vowels full of odors which are the prayers of saints you know what saints that's that lamb and the one that was sitting on the throne was the same person amen it was the same god yes the whole time but see john's perception totally changed from thinking nobody could open the book to okay the lion can open the book but really it's a lamb a lamb you know that's the reality of it saints we this lamb that that john saw was bloody was slain was was was was was jesus didn't look good on the cross it's the most pitiful scene you've ever seen you'll never see a scene that's pitiful as that and yet we've never looked at i mean mel gibson didn't even touch it when he made the passion of the christ i mean just barely scratched the surface but that's what john saw and yet that is what god used to redeem amen to bring forth redemption and open back the seals for us amen so it wasn't it it's not it john could have seen it and stayed crying the whole time and no i won't i won't believe what you're saying elder i won't believe it this is how it is amen but god wants to show you a different reality that's not the way you think it is and it doesn't have to stay that way that's right amen there is forgiveness amen there is a feeling amen there is a salvation for you there is hope when you think there is no hope amen amen god has god has it all taken care of amen and it changed everything for john amen it changed everything for john and it can change everything for you oh yeah amen but just pay just just make sure that you hold this reality right before you instead of just your own perceptions amen amen praise god now if the brothers can just show that little video real quick now i'm just going to give you a little warning you just forget the video isn't bad it just makes a point it has no sound i took the sound from it so you know might show women in pajamas and stuff but it makes a point and and i hope that that that young people take a look at this because i want you to understand that the reality of what you might see on instagram or on facebook and all these things that's not reality an image is not a reality a picture that you see on on the internet is not a reality the reality is the actual person when you're with that person that's the reality a picture can be manipulated in any way especially nowadays so just just roll the the video uh brother why do you want to turn that off so here's this girl she gets up in the morning she's brushing her teeth putting fixing herself up takes a picture smiling very nice she's pretty and she says down at the bottom sophie good morning and uh she woke up like this hashtag woke up like this you know she didn't wake up like that so he gets it he gets that picture so he goes he takes a picture of himself and he says 30 kilometer bike ride done i didn't see a bike anywhere but that's what he made this girl think so it it makes her want to start fixing her desk all pretty but look at that corner right there and look where she writes she says becky getting organized hashtag creative something and so he looks at it so of course he takes a picture of his breakfast but he's like what in the world but i just buy throws it in the trash but then he says super healthy breakfast new me so he gets it he sees it and so now he's looking at himself in the mirror it's what satan does so now he's going through his wardrobe of clothes just changing look multiple pictures taken and and and now in his instagram he finally picks the right one it says uh yes styling effortly like he didn't take him no effort to get to that point so now here's a group supposed to be eating together and and chatting with each other and hashtag good times laughs quality time with these guys i love spending quality time with her but they're back on their phones so she wants to take a picture with her boyfriend he doesn't want to spend any time right now he's watching tv he's busy and he's like okay i don't wanna i don't i'm just trying to watch tv i'm trying to watch reality tv yeah and and so she goes and posted on facebook and or on instagram says hashtag relationship goals hashtag bay my man so she's upset she's sad right but then she starts getting those likes those loves and that's what makes her smile that's the label when in reality it wasn't that way her her boyfriend was like like go do something else i'm busy but it made her smile that she was getting those likes or those loves and stuff like that saints and that's not our reality a reality is not likes and our reality is not is not so don't don't don't be influenced by what you see online that's right that's not that's not real oh i saw it on the internet yeah that doesn't make it real oh i saw it on cnn that doesn't make it real oh i saw it on fox news as conservative as they might be it doesn't make it real they still get paid by pharmaceuticals and stuff like that and they got to push those things it doesn't make it real you have to think for yourself amen right you have to look at your life and base it on the reality of the word and if it doesn't match up with the reality of the word then don't take it don't accept it because all it is is you chasing something that you'll never be able to obtain amen and that's what satan wants you to do amen chase rabbits and chase things in your life that you will never be able to obtain amen when you have all the reality there is in the word of god amen amen how many love the word amen praise god so who do you say that he is amen only you can determine that as you walk closer with god they're not exactly right only you can determine that brother man praise god let's enter our feet musicians come praise god your perceptions versus god's reality i want god's reality amen man lord take away these perceptions that uh in my life they're there amen if they're not based on the word amen i don't want anything to do with them amen praise the lord praise god victory amen victory in jesus name [Music] the whole story how a savior came [Music] like me i heard [Music] my savior forever he saw me amen that's a reality saints that he died for you he spilled his blood he shed his blood just for you done something that no man would ever have be able to do for you he did that for you amen what can you do for him all he wants you to do is believe his word take him at his word trust what he said about you that's the reality and that can change [Music] amen to see [Music] the victory oh victory jesus if anybody has any need a prayer we'll be more than glad to pray for you he saw me with his redeeming blood he loved me and all my love let's just sing that chorus once again brother wade you want to come oh victory in jesus my savior forever [Music] he plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing cloth hey man let's give our brother a good hand [Applause] that's why man you can't believe nothing you see er here that comes from anywhere else but the word of god glory and the ministers

amen and we don't want to be we've never been a doomsday church right we want to we want you to live your life to the fullest in the glory of the lord and plan your instruments and we sure are proud of all the all the youth that we already have amen amen we are so proud of them and watching them the greatest thing that brother dale's always said the greatest gift you could ever give him is to act out there basically the same as you act in here when you go somewhere they said oh you're from spoken word church you you love to play your instruments so you some people go to florida and didn't even know they were going to play just having to take their instruments with them and they got to play a solo and then they got to play in the service and had a real good time they played for four hours straight four and a half hours straight they had a prayer line they had service after basically service after service and these two young ladies played for four and a half hours continually playing for the glory of the lord and man four and a half hours other people are doing other things but you know what god will honor that man he'll never it'll never return void what you do if you do it for the lord you got to do it for him first though and i believe these sisters did it for the lord first so i mean for four and a half hours man you get in a you get an anointing though and it really doesn't matter oh yeah all right you weren't sorry i mean your hands weren't sore tired don't look at me like that your hands weren't tired you had to quit but they did well so you know we thank the lord and that's a testament of what happens in the in the church here is that when our youth go to another place they act right because listen folks june and i were counselors for eight years in alabama we saw the best and the worst hey man june had to chase women and chase the little girls around with um lipstick writing lipstick all over the wall and trying to put on clothes it wasn't worth anything remember on the ceiling yeah exactly so we've seen it all so if you'll go for the glory of the lord though he'll do something for you if you go just to play then you ain't going to get nothing right amen that's the same way with church service so if you stand to your feet just remember that now monday morning at nine o'clock have somebody standing at the computer or sitting at a computer getting you registered for this the church is going to pay for it be nothing out of your pocket we're going to try to get some chaperones to go and if we have to all pile in several cars then i'd like to go a service or two maybe but uh but i'd like for the uh for it to be a good contingency of the of our church to go so uh and we thank brother dale again for always being mindful of the youth and being able to forward the money so it wouldn't cost anything out of your pocket listen folks i've seen a lot of people when we were in alabama there's a lot of people and a lot of churches that the kids would have to work overtime or pick up cans or do some kind of side job just to get i think it was 89 dollars when the gym and 80 80 something dollars at the end that was in the early 2000s just to get to you to be able to come to youth camp they had to afford get their own money they had to get their own food they had to get their own way there and they had to work to be able to get off just for that 80 bucks to get to that camp but you know what god honored that i believe those are the ones that when they went to the altar they got something amen i guess it would be good to say that that that 189 covers their sleeping that's everything three meals a day three meals a day for four days yeah so i think that's a pretty good deal yeah it's a good deal probably get there thursday and then friday saturday and then sunday morning service so yeah it's a good day a real good deal and especially that the word of god is gonna go they're gonna listen to the word of god every day yeah and be able to fellowship with other believers and uh and all that so god bless you beloved would love the lord now this coming sunday brother bob's gonna be in blue ridge brother luis is gonna be in jacksonville i'm sorry beaufort south carolina thank you you're okay keep me straight like our mama so we want to pray for them and that they'll be safe but what we're going to do is we're going to have a meeting listen sunday is the last sunday we get to meet before we have our actual meeting on saturday and sunday july 3rd and 4th so what i'll do is after i finish the service cut the service short a little bit we're all going to stay up here and we're all going to discuss what we're going to do we've already got meal we've already got the basics of what we're going to do but but we need to know where we need people to put put out our own tables or our own chairs or bring this or bring that all these instruments have got to go place opens at two o'clock we need to have a contingency of people there at two o'clock so if you work on i have to work that saturday because that girl's already asked off for that um holiday weekend so but i'll be done by two o'clock but we need to have a contingency of people there and say listen if you ain't got a job say what can i do right all right hey man so we need everybody there girls boys young people okay yeah you've known it for three or four months take off yeah take off that saturday watching some of our people that travel tonight yeah so we need to post that we need to post that if anybody that travels a long way needs a place to spend the night i know we sister barbara and and sister regina stayed with us when the ladies went on their on their excursions so if you got an extra bedroom so it won't hinder anybody that can people that can stay close you sure free to uh to request a place to place to uh to stay we can all go and stay with tony and esther they got plenty room so we'll just all go over there and let them have i guess not so so we got plenty of room though if anybody needs a place you don't have to travel i know it's going to be listen it's going to be late night but we're going to get something out of this service i've already been praying you should be praying every day praying that god will be magnified in these services it's not just going to be our billboard of 50th anniversary jubilee let it be our jubilee year individually if it doesn't happen individually it's not gonna happen in that building because the building is gonna be used for everything else in the world kind of like brother branham he would go into a place and have to see demons hanging all over the walls you know because of what happened before those things are real folks you have to pray those things out of there and that's what we're going to do when we get there is pray that the lord but we can pray before that right we can send the angel of the lord and let him clean that place up before we get there amen so let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us thank you for the word that we've heard now i pray pray that we hold it in our heart and lord i pray that you would give each one in this building that mashes that registration button on monday morning that you'll give us a place lord for our children and our young adults to go to this camp and that they'll enjoy their self lord and you'll get all the praise and honor and glory for it because there's nothing else left in this world as brother louise said everything's fake fictitious not real but you're real there's one god and you're real and as the song goes you're reeling our heart and that's what we need to keep you lord and let that reality show forth the world may think we're crazy but that's okay they're living in a non-real condition but we're living in the reality of a living god thank you lord for the things you've given us today lord now i pray that you'll be with us on the highways bless us lord until we come back together sunday and we'll worship you in spirit and truth we'll be praying lord all of us for the meetings in july the third and fourth that you'll lord truly give us an individual jubilee that will listen to that trumpet sound and we can go free and never have to go back into bondage again father give us this day our daily bread lord and thank you for all things in jesus name we pray amen you're dismissed god bless you
