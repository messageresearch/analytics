[3:40] brothers and sisters will like Precious
[3:42] faith we pray Lord that that we can say
[3:45] something that'll that'll help you we
[3:49] got to I I do realize that it's not just
[3:53] coming to church
[3:54] we are the church we bring the church
[3:57] with us we bring God with us so we need
[4:00] to brother Brown said made a statement
[4:02] I've never forgotten and and I've I've
[4:05] looked for it and uh I've seen it ever
[4:08] since he baptized me with the Holy
[4:10] Spirit
[4:10] he said if you read the Bible
[4:13] and don't see Christ in every verse he
[4:16] said reads again you miss something so
[4:18] I'm gonna I'm gonna see if I can by the
[4:22] grace of God that maybe I don't know how
[4:24] this is going to work out I've never I'm
[4:26] not used to this I'm used to just kind
[4:28] of like kind of like brother 40 you know
[4:30] just kind of hits a starter and go but
[4:34] I'd like to read this and I'd like to
[4:36] start putting my life in putting your
[4:39] life in in putting the son of man's life
[4:42] into the scriptures and bringing it out
[4:44] because somewhere
[4:46] there's a people on the face of this
[4:48] Earth that's predestinated for ordained
[4:52] to fulfill this position and we can only
[4:56] do it by seeing what the word is and who
[5:00] he is what he's done and what he's doing
[5:02] now and what he'll always do there is
[5:05] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today or
[5:07] forever I was saying about brother uh
[5:09] Sam when he uh he took that scripture uh
[5:13] Hebrews 13 5 and 7 or 5-9 and and I was
[5:17] seeing now I don't I don't know how
[5:19] other people I can only speak for myself
[5:21] but I was seeing when he was reading
[5:23] that I was seeing it through
[5:25] spiritualizing God God blessed me then
[5:29] can I put that in this scripture
[5:32] will it will he come to this scripture
[5:34] now let's just read this and let's just
[5:36] pray about his moment before we get
[5:38] started here father in the precious name
[5:40] of Jesus Christ again we say Lord
[5:43] God just be with us and help us Lord God
[5:45] let your servant just step aside father
[5:47] God did we can we can say seals we can
[5:51] say Thunders we can say trumpets we can
[5:53] say but at all is Jesus Christ God just
[5:57] help us father to bring you on the scene
[6:00] Lord God and let the people see in their
[6:03] own life who you are and what you've
[6:05] done for him father and what you're
[6:07] going to do in the name of Jesus Christ
[6:10] we committed to that into thy holy hands
[6:12] amen
[6:13] Let's uh read this and we'll get started
[6:17] here maybe
[6:19] if I
[6:21] I don't think I'm going to be too long
[6:23] but you know how that goes
[6:25] the Lord is my shepherd now I'm gonna
[6:27] just I'm going to read this I'm gonna
[6:29] let you set it on that because I got
[6:30] quite a few scriptures I want to read
[6:32] but and then I want to comment on this
[6:35] right here and I want to try to to bring
[6:37] you to a reality to you
[6:40] now he said with the Lord is my shepherd
[6:42] the first thing we think about is David
[6:44] David but see I believe it was somebody
[6:47] in David was saying this I believe that
[6:50] God had a man to say this and pin this
[6:53] and it put it in the description that
[6:55] one day in 19 or 2000 so there would be
[6:59] somebody that would pick us up and see
[7:01] that this was them right
[7:03] that I don't mean just just that he's my
[7:06] shepherd see he is my shepherd He is my
[7:09] Lord he is my God he is this he is
[7:12] Hebrew 13 8. listen down now we're going
[7:15] we're going to go to this in the next
[7:16] scripture we're going to see if this
[7:18] here fits now the Lord is my shepherd I
[7:21] shall not want now if you've got the new
[7:24] birth now you have been Justified and
[7:27] Sanctified and you have the new birth
[7:30] there Comes A Time in your life that you
[7:33] don't want the world in the ways of the
[7:35] world you want God in God alone now
[7:38] let's just walk it down a little bit he
[7:40] makes me to lie down in Green Pastures
[7:43] he leads me beside the Still Waters the
[7:47] pastors the word that this quietness and
[7:50] the and the the Stillness of the
[7:53] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[7:55] you when you're in turmoil all manner of
[7:59] things is going on that he is holding
[8:02] you and you're seeing it in this
[8:03] scripture because when you see this
[8:05] scripture fulfilled here you're seeing
[8:08] Daniel 9 24 made manifest which is a son
[8:11] of man because he's the only one that
[8:14] that can bring this to into operation or
[8:17] to into completeness now uh I'm I'm just
[8:22] I'm going to try to speak about my
[8:24] experience I I noticed that that Brother
[8:27] Sam every time brother Wade in the
[8:30] ministry but about brother Aaron and I
[8:32] and I watch him and I watch it coming
[8:34] down it's just like when Brother Sam was
[8:37] it was bringing this Sunday I I watched
[8:40] it it's a spiritual part of it fit right
[8:43] in the description that God had given me
[8:45] now I hope and pray with all my heart
[8:49] that God will show you these things it
[8:52] will bring it to you because there's
[8:54] things that we are preordained
[8:56] predestinated to fulfilled
[8:59] and nobody has ever did this before as a
[9:02] church what we have got to do
[9:06] and it's going to take the complete
[9:08] revelation of the son of man almighty
[9:11] God to bring us into operation or to
[9:14] completeness now it's I mean he made me
[9:17] to lie down in Green Pastures
[9:20] he brings me he brings me he I can see
[9:23] him in my in my life I said I was going
[9:26] to read and let y'all go and that's what
[9:28] I'm gonna do
[9:29] excuse me I mean this he's making me to
[9:31] lie down in green passion he leads me
[9:33] beside the Still Waters he restoreth my
[9:36] soul he leadeth me in the path of
[9:39] righteousness for his namesake this is
[9:42] my shepherd and your Shepherd Lord
[9:44] that's doing this yeah though I walk
[9:47] through the valley of the shatter of
[9:48] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[9:51] with me thy rod in thy staff that
[9:53] covered me thou prepares a table before
[9:57] me in the presence of mine enemies thou
[9:59] anointed my head with oil my cup runneth
[10:02] over surely goodness and mercy shall
[10:05] follow me all the days of my life and I
[10:07] will dwell in the house of the Lord
[10:09] forever you can be seated
[10:12] and then let's just back up here just in
[10:14] just a moment before before we move on

[10:23] Ghost and he showed you how he give you
[10:25] the baptism holy ghost He restored your
[10:28] soul he brought you back from the pits
[10:31] of hell where that we all deserved this
[10:34] but by God's grace and mercy he looked
[10:37] down from Glory by by and seen his
[10:40] attributes down here and seen what they
[10:43] would do and what they were and he said
[10:45] that made his mind up of course we know
[10:48] it was always made up but he so he said
[10:50] I'm going to bring him in and I'm going
[10:53] I'm by this what I see here I have
[10:55] elected him and I'm going to bring him
[10:57] to the place that he's gonna I'm gonna
[11:00] bring him back and show him where I put
[11:02] his name on my blind book of life before
[11:05] the foundation of the world you and I

[11:09] body in the rapture we gonna see that
[11:12] and if we don't see that we better get

[11:27] talking about the Thunders
[11:29] and you know what they do
[11:31] and that's what I'm doing

[11:37] God always reveals himself
[11:39] and he restoreth my soul he leadeth me
[11:42] in the past of righteousness for his
[11:44] name's sake
[11:46] yea though I walk through the valley of
[11:48] the shadow of death now from the moment
[11:51] that you was conceived in your mother's
[11:53] womb
[11:54] the shadow of death started on you and I
[11:57] God by his mercy and Grace gave you an
[12:01] angel right there
[12:02] if you don't believe it what about John
[12:04] the Baptist right
[12:06] he knew that if there what Satan was
[12:09] going to do to you and by that he put
[12:12] your name on the last book of life
[12:14] before the foundation word that you
[12:15] couldn't be lost

[15:46] let's hit the field let's just go ahead
[15:47] let your conversation be without
[15:49] Covetous and be content with such things
[15:52] as you have for he has said I will never
[15:55] leave thee nor forsake do you remember
[15:57] the scripture I just read here he said
[15:59] he would never leave you and he'd never
[16:01] forsake you you must see Church you must
[16:04] see that you've got a job to do and he's
[16:07] promised you that he would be with you
[16:09] and he would do this job he would
[16:12] absolutely make you what he wants you to
[16:15] be what he saw you before there was a
[16:17] foundation in the world he saw you as
[16:19] what you are
[16:22] exactly
[16:23] remember them which have to rule over
[16:26] you see he said I said in the church
[16:28] Apostles prophets evangelists passes and
[16:31] teachers for the Perfection of the
[16:33] Saints till we all come to the Statue of
[16:35] the perfect man the units of the faith
[16:41] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[16:44] and forever now he says here by this
[16:48] here happening be not carried about
[16:50] we're divers and strange doctrines
[16:53] and I might say this
[16:56] there's and and I I hesitate and uh to
[17:01] to but we spend more time
[17:05] in the world than we do with Jesus
[17:08] Christ
[17:10] I said we
[17:12] now
[17:18] but you know I carried about with divers
[17:20] are strange let's let me say this
[17:22] where do we have more faith in
[17:25] in doctors
[17:28] in medicines or God
[17:33] think about it just think about it Susan
[17:37] see
[17:38] praise God
[17:40] see we we have to come to the position
[17:43] brother blatter me one time when he was
[17:46] shot up and he was he was drinking he
[17:48] had been shot and was taking all that
[17:49] medicine and and and just drinking milk
[17:52] and bread and or whatever he was he
[17:55] decided one time he said the word of God
[17:57] says he's the same yesterday today and
[17:59] forever and we the stripes I'm Healed
[18:03] and he walked off of there eating and
[18:07] spitting up between his face his fingers
[18:10] now I've tried that before
[18:13] it didn't work for me
[18:16] but now I wonder if I had stayed with it
[18:18] I'd like to die I quit taking this and I
[18:21] quit taking everything I told Brother
[18:22] somebody he didn't tell me not to do it
[18:25] he told me just know what I was doing
[18:27] I like to die now I couldn't have died
[18:31] I'm standing here
[18:35] so I didn't I didn't persevere I know I
[18:38] but I did tell the Lord something I said
[18:40] Lord if I ever do that again you'll tell
[18:43] me but maybe he was telling me and I
[18:45] just didn't know that
[18:47] but anyway Jesus Christ the same
[18:49] yesterday and fair be cared not about
[18:51] with divers and strange doctors for is a
[18:53] good thing that the heart be established
[18:55] with Grace not with me which have not
[18:58] profited them that have been occupied
[19:00] therein
[19:02] okay let me hear let me read this one
[19:05] right here now and then let me just go
[19:08] here I still I'm just trying to get
[19:10] myself together let your conversation be
[19:13] without coveters and be content with
[19:15] such things as you have or you have I I
[19:17] would never leave enough for safety the
[19:20] Lord is my helper I will now fear what
[19:22] man shall do to me remember them which
[19:24] have the rule over you have spoken unto
[19:26] you the word of God whose Faith father
[19:28] considered the end of their conversation
[19:31] the manner of Life Jesus Christ the same
[19:33] yesterday and today and forever be not
[19:37] carried about with divers and strange
[19:38] doctors for is a good thing that the
[19:40] heart be established with Grace not with
[19:42] Meats which have not profited them that
[19:45] have been occupied therein now I want to
[19:48] go to he uh Isaiah 43 1. I want to just
[19:51] kind of pick up the Pacey if I can
[19:56] now if you can't see Jesus Christ in
[20:00] every verse right you miss something
[20:02] read it again
[20:04] now I I I preach more out of the Old
[20:09] Testament than really I believe that I
[20:11] have in the new uh because Paul uh he he
[20:16] went into Arabia and studied for three
[20:18] and a half years or so and come out and
[20:20] preach 14 I mean 14 uh uh books in the
[20:24] New Testament where'd he get them at he
[20:26] get them right here brother I just read
[20:28] what bro Brown said he said he said and
[20:30] I thought this one time well Pig and I
[20:33] had went to bed one night when we lived
[20:35] in Duluth and uh I was laying there
[20:37] because she always went to sleep for me
[20:39] and I just laying there thinking talking
[20:40] to the Lord about it about about his
[20:43] word and I looked up and I Saw an Eagle
[20:47] coming let me just tell you what
[20:49] happened an ego coming and it and it
[20:52] come and when it got about where this
[20:54] clock is right there he just turned into
[20:56] this black Bible right here
[20:59] and was like this right here
[21:01] and come right into my bosom
[21:03] now I appreciate God for those little
[21:05] things uh uh if you want to call them
[21:07] little things but uh God is being
[21:10] blessed he has really blessed me he is
[21:12] he is he's given me uh his word and I
[21:16] can see it into in the Old Testament as
[21:19] well as the New Testament but let's just
[21:21] read that start read here the first
[21:22] verse first third chapter of Isaiah
[21:26] but now thus saith the Lord that created
[21:29] thee o Jacob that's me you that formed
[21:33] thee Oh is wrong that's you and me fear
[21:35] not for I have redeemed thee
[21:38] I have called thee by thy name Thou Art
[21:41] mine
[21:43] amen now has he done this
[21:45] when I pass this through the waters the
[21:48] peoples the world when I passed when
[21:51] thou passes through the waters I will be
[21:54] with thee and through the rivers floods
[21:59] things seems to be just running over you
[22:01] I mean pushing you down I mean all
[22:03] manner of evil is is coming against you
[22:06] and the people
[22:08] I will be with thee and through the
[22:11] rivers they shall not overflow thee see
[22:13] he promised you I'll never be I'll never
[22:15] leave you I'll never forsake you see
[22:18] when thou walkest through the fire
[22:21] thy shall not be burned
[22:24] neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee
[22:28] to really to damage you now that don't
[22:31] mean it won't get hot
[22:33] and it it might leave some scars but it
[22:36] ain't going to take you away from here
[22:39] for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One
[22:41] of Israel
[22:42] thy savior
[22:44] I gave Egypt for thou Ransom Egypt's
[22:48] world
[22:49] Ethiopian and seeba for these world
[22:51] since that was precious in my sight thy
[22:55] has been honorable and I have lived thee
[22:58] therefore will I give men for thee and
[23:01] people for thou life now I'm seeing I'm
[23:03] seeing the bride here
[23:05] I'm not talking about
[23:07] thousands of years ago which did that
[23:10] happen right
[23:12] right for I am with thee
[23:15] I will bring thy seed from the East and
[23:18] gather thee from the west and the first
[23:20] thing people they see Israel they see
[23:22] but see we come from the East and the
[23:25] West
[23:26] I will say to the north to give up and
[23:30] give to the South and to the South keep
[23:32] not back bring my sons from afar and my
[23:35] daughters from the ends of the Earth
[23:37] either everyone that is called by my
[23:40] name amen
[23:42] I have created him for my glory
[23:45] I have formed him yea I have made him
[23:48] now we can go back into predestination
[23:51] we can go back into what uh uh uh
[23:54] Hebrews 13 5-9 right there and put it
[23:57] right in the Book of Psalms right there
[23:59] and go and and just it's just bring it
[24:01] down to that
[24:02] but but let me continue bring forth the
[24:06] blind people now let's see if it fits
[24:08] our day
[24:09] bring forth the blind people that have
[24:11] eyes
[24:12] and the death that have ears
[24:15] religious people right people that says
[24:18] they're in this message
[24:19] following this message
[24:22] let not all the nations be gathered
[24:24] together
[24:27] let all the nations be gathered together
[24:29] and let the people be assembled who
[24:31] among them can declare this and show us
[24:35] former things
[24:38] let them bring forth their Witnesses
[24:43] that they may be justified or let them
[24:46] hear and say it is truth
[24:50] ye are my Witnesses
[24:53] saith the Lord now I'm saying a witness
[24:57] not just uh uh even like with brother
[25:00] Paul Peter John but we're a witness of a
[25:04] part of redemption that them brothers
[25:07] didn't know
[25:10] we come to a position in a place through
[25:14] experience that when he says here ye are
[25:18] my Witnesses saith the Lord and my
[25:21] servant whom I have chosen
[25:24] predestination
[25:26] by election
[25:28] God's looked down and seen where he was
[25:30] at and were brought us so election looks
[25:32] to foreknowledge
[25:34] foreknowledge is in my soul called a
[25:36] baptism of Holy Ghost
[25:39] for now these looks to predestination
[25:42] predestination looks to Destiny we this
[25:45] is revealed to us church this is made
[25:48] known to us somebody here on the face of
[25:51] this Earth this day this time
[25:55] it's been made no
[25:58] man that ye may know and believe me and
[26:01] understand that I am he before me there
[26:04] was no God formed neither shall there be
[26:06] I to me brother and when he preached
[26:07] Christ the Mr gar revealed he said he
[26:10] had a plan and a purpose that he was
[26:11] going to achieve
[26:13] and he was going to do it and they're
[26:15] sitting here
[26:18] he said it if you if you fail to see it
[26:21] here he said come back to this message
[26:23] which was a threefold mystery of the
[26:26] Bride of Jesus Christ
[26:28] say well that was great okay
[26:32] before me there was no God formed
[26:35] neither shall there be after me
[26:37] I even I am the Lord and beside me there
[26:40] is no Savior and I'll fix and say a
[26:42] moment ago when he when he said that he
[26:44] turned and turned he went to Colossians
[26:46] 1.
[26:47] the whole message brother Jesus Christ
[26:50] the same yesterday today and forever
[26:54] I even I I even I am the Lord and
[26:57] besides me there is no savior
[27:00] I have declared and have saved and have
[27:02] shown there was no strange God among you
[27:05] therefore ye are my Witnesses saith the
[27:08] Lord that I am God
[27:11] I hope it's getting over
[27:14] I mean I got I've I've agonized
[27:17] with this
[27:19] yet before yay before the day was I am
[27:23] I am he and there is none that can
[27:25] deliver out of my hand I will work and
[27:28] who shall let it thus saith the Lord
[27:30] your Redeemer the Holy One of Israel for
[27:32] your sake I have sent to Babylon and
[27:35] brought down all their nobles in the
[27:37] Chaldeans whose cries in their ships
[27:40] this is the World Church everything
[27:42] every obstacle that has come against you
[27:45] he has promised you that he would take
[27:47] care of it and put it down and he's
[27:49] right here in the scripture telling you
[27:51] he'll do it all you got to do is just
[27:53] come in and get into this word
[27:56] and he'll show you
[27:59] right I am the Lord the Holy One the
[28:01] creator of Israel your king thus saith
[28:04] the Lord which maketh the way in the sea
[28:06] and a path in the mighty Waters he's
[28:08] telling you how great he is and all that
[28:11] he can do it can do and has done and
[28:14] will do
[28:15] which bringeth forth to Chariot and
[28:17] horse and Army and the power that shall
[28:19] lie down together they shall not rise
[28:21] they are extinct they are quenched as
[28:23] two
[28:25] amen I was thinking here
[28:29] uh I was reading here where brother
[28:31] Brandon says in the countdown page 19
[28:33] paragraph 96 he said and any man that
[28:37] ever lives for God will have to go
[28:39] beyond these five senses right
[28:44] and we keep looking that we're going
[28:46] Beyond these five senses but I'm saying
[28:48] that's what when you take God's word
[28:52] and you say with his straps I'm Healed
[28:54] you just went beyond your senses
[29:01] a lot of people appreciate this but
[29:03] maybe we will he says once you I was
[29:07] talking to Peggy about it today he said
[29:09] once you come to the front to the altar
[29:12] to be prayed for for a certain thing he
[29:14] said don't you come back for that
[29:15] tomorrow
[29:17] he said don't he said don't never come
[29:18] back now if it's a back I mean it's
[29:20] using if it's a back problem
[29:22] well when God heals you from that back
[29:25] you don't come back until he's
[29:27] manifested
[29:29] but if you get another back ache you
[29:31] come back again
[29:34] do you understand
[29:36] but he I mean he plainly said that
[29:39] so okay where am I at
[29:50] okay I wanna I wanna in case if we don't
[29:53] believe that we can do this and I'm
[29:55] stuttering around here a little bit
[29:56] tonight I I just I apologize for that I
[29:59] just uh I've had a couple of days it's
[30:01] been really been kind of hard
[30:04] not being able to sleep and that I'm not
[30:07] trying to justify myself I'm just saying
[30:09] it sometimes Satan knows you what you're
[30:11] trying to bring and he'll wear you out
[30:14] and uh but uh I just got through reading
[30:17] about it reading about the Holy One of
[30:19] Israel and the the the one that said
[30:22] that the Lord is my shepherd I shall not
[30:24] want you see I mean I I just got through
[30:27] reading about the one that is my
[30:29] shepherd that is my savior that is my
[30:32] redeemer that is my all in all he is
[30:35] Hebrew 13 8.
[30:39] uh I I just uh I mentioned this last
[30:42] time I was up here and I I really feel
[30:45] like that people might not think that
[30:50] they can do or say I I was thinking
[30:51] there in a country code in Dr book 145
[30:54] there he said give me a church full of
[30:56] Holy Spirit Holy Ghost I got to do in a
[30:59] year what theologians failed to do in
[31:01] 2000 years he said when the last Gentile
[31:03] is is a is brought in
[31:06] God he said God he said God anointed
[31:08] church then
[31:09] but but this is the thing that I want to
[31:12] tell you I believe that a church before
[31:16] that happens I believe that God is going
[31:19] to so anoint so brain a body a church a
[31:23] group of people that's predestinated to
[31:27] this position that they going to stop
[31:30] the effects of Satan on you see when
[31:33] when the last Gentile comes in you know
[31:36] that it's over it's over see but
[31:39] something has to bring us to the place
[31:41] where the last Gentile is in
[31:46] is going to stop his effects on us he
[31:50] will bang us he will come against us
[31:52] right after the change but he is not
[31:54] going to have any effects on us
[31:57] do you believe that
[32:00] well why don't we start doing it why
[32:02] don't we start acting like it I mean all
[32:04] of us
[32:08] uh
[32:09] I'm gonna go to uh I really I think I'll
[32:12] read more than uh than just a 18th
[32:15] chapter of Genesis I mean I'm going to
[32:16] read the 18th chapter but I want to
[32:19] uh
[32:20] read just a little just a little bit of
[32:25] because he said in here he told Abraham
[32:28] three times that him and savior we're
[32:30] going to have a child let's have a son
[32:32] yeah
[32:33] and he walked for 25 years so listen he
[32:36] walked for 25 years it was a journey
[32:38] that he took just like you and I are
[32:40] taking a journey there's things just
[32:42] shedding off of us every day every day
[32:44] they say God is taking everything and
[32:46] adding yourself that's what this statue
[32:48] of perfect man is he's taken 11 the
[32:51] unleavened bread out of you and put his
[32:53] own lavender inside you where you won't
[32:55] take nobody else's word I don't care
[32:58] what devil is coming against you you
[33:00] will not take what he says you say with
[33:03] your stripes Lord Jesus I'm Healed
[33:11] okay
[33:15] now I'm going to start right here and
[33:17] the Lord appeared unto him in the plains
[33:19] of memory and he said in the tent doors
[33:21] of first verses 18 chapter the heat of
[33:23] the day now this has been spoke of
[33:25] spoken of many many many times by many
[33:29] many people but it has to become real to
[33:32] you
[33:32] God himself in human flesh appeared unto
[33:36] Abraham
[33:38] now God in human flesh can appear again
[33:42] right here in this Pulpit right in front
[33:45] of you and I
[33:47] he said when Jesus come here the word of
[33:50] he was the word of God in flesh and then
[33:53] when he comes inside of you he becomes
[33:55] the word in your flesh
[33:57] your flesh not just your soul but see
[34:01] that's what he that's what listen in the
[34:03] mind the Mind people don't think much of
[34:05] the mind but without the mind the body
[34:07] don't work
[34:09] but faith comes by hearing how many
[34:11] times have we heard faith comes by
[34:13] hearing and that by the word when you
[34:16] hear the word it comes to your mind you
[34:18] either reject it or receive it right
[34:20] there
[34:21] and if you receive it it comes down
[34:23] through those memory reason affection
[34:25] and so forth imagination and comes
[34:27] inside your soul God turns right around
[34:30] there right he gives you a revelation
[34:32] and brings it right back up through them
[34:34] same senses stamps your brain this is
[34:37] the truth what I just read to you and it
[34:39] brings it through your see tasteful
[34:41] smelling here
[34:43] he does that
[34:48] I like to lost my glasses again
[34:54] amen I'll tell you it's it's a it's a
[34:58] simple thing it's just like a uh uh well
[35:01] it's simple when it's revealed
[35:04] right and it's not simple until it's
[35:06] revealed there's people and listen how
[35:09] how blessed we are
[35:11] there's people that don't see nothing
[35:14] what you see
[35:17] right listen the two Cadillacs just
[35:19] think about this the two Cadillacs
[35:22] people sees them to Cadillacs and rising
[35:25] of the sun they can't see them sitting
[35:27] there they ain't sitting there
[35:29] they're moving they're moving through
[35:30] this building right now
[35:32] God got his his Holy Spirit In His
[35:35] Cadillac in the baptismal Holy Ghost
[35:37] since you are
[35:38] he's moving he's not just sitting there
[35:41] and Satan ain't either
[35:45] okay he's rolling This World In His
[35:47] Cadillac
[35:48] that's so close that it would deceive
[35:50] the elected
[35:51] so we've got these things that we've got
[35:54] to know and what to look for
[35:57] to be able to withstand it
[36:00] do you want it to surprise you
[36:06] I tell you that to me that's a great
[36:08] thing to know right
[36:11] right because he said that God's given
[36:13] time now that Cadillac is going up and
[36:16] the other one's going down
[36:18] but they look just alike
[36:28] okay
[36:30] and he lifted up his eyes and looked in
[36:32] low three minutes stood by him and when
[36:34] he saw them he ran to meet them from the
[36:36] tent door and bowed himself toward the
[36:38] ground I want you to listen closely and
[36:41] said my Lord my Lord
[36:44] he recognized him
[36:47] my Lord if if now I have found favor in
[36:50] thy side past not away I pray thee from
[36:52] thy servant this was the Old Testament
[36:57] they didn't have the baptism of the Holy
[36:59] Ghost like we have today and he brought
[37:02] God on the scene
[37:03] and it listen your life can bring God on
[37:07] the scene to you and he can bring his
[37:09] brother he can bring him on the scene to
[37:11] you then talk to you face to face lift
[37:14] the ear God can do it and he does it
[37:17] I've seen him do it
[37:19] I've seen him raise the dead more than
[37:22] once I've seen I've seen God all manner
[37:26] of healings I've had that well I won't
[37:29] some you know brother said a dream
[37:31] interpreted as a vision
[37:33] you know if you'll go to Daniel 9 24
[37:36] well I was talking about a while ago and
[37:38] the Lord is my shepherd there in Psalms
[37:40] 23 1-6
[37:42] and when you see him right there you see
[37:45] you see Daniel 9 24.
[37:47] can you see that can you see the son of
[37:50] man in that right there the shepherd
[37:52] they're able one Shepherd
[37:55] and when this here is manifested and he
[37:58] says you are my witnesses that this is
[38:00] so and this is me and the and I've done
[38:03] it I've done it
[38:07] so he said we ain't got faith for divine
[38:10] needle let alone Rapture in faith he
[38:12] said that something will have to come
[38:13] they'll they'll give us such factions
[38:16] and sweep us up out in Earth and it's
[38:18] here to do that it's not something that
[38:21] I'm looking to come right
[38:24] I'm not
[38:25] I've told my wife I told I tell him I
[38:28] said Lord I'm gonna walk with you if I
[38:31] have to walk by myself
[38:33] I don't believe you I'm gonna have to
[38:34] walk by myself but if I have to walk by
[38:36] myself I'm going to walk with you as
[38:37] long as you show me Lord It's You
[38:43] right now I want you to look look at it
[38:46] how many times have we said here in this
[38:49] congregation and listened to the life of
[38:52] Abraham brought on the scene
[38:56] do you realize I've got it in my notes
[38:58] Here
[38:59] he's talking about
[39:01] Mary had a virgin womb
[39:04] natural
[39:06] and spiritual
[39:07] had a virgin womb virgin and he says and
[39:11] so will we
[39:13] will be a virgin he and he said that in
[39:16] churches book
[39:17] he's either true seed
[39:20] God who presented Christ with a word of
[39:22] brow virgin right
[39:24] with that spot or would I wrinkle right
[39:27] he said she'd have the saith the Lord
[39:29] and nothing
[39:30] she didn't know what she'd have God's
[39:32] word and know what God wanted done with
[39:34] it and do it right
[39:43] and he lifted up his eyes and looked and
[39:46] little three men stood by him and when
[39:48] he saw them he ran to meet them from the
[39:50] 10 door and bowed himself toward it and
[39:51] says my Lord now if I have found favor
[39:53] and that's how I passed out of the way I
[39:55] pray thee from thy servant let a little
[39:57] water I pray you you record where Paul
[40:00] got that
[40:02] record where Paul got that
[40:06] he saw another little man do that one
[40:08] time in the upper room
[40:13] a little water I pray you be fished and
[40:16] wash your feet and rest yourselves under
[40:17] the tree and I will fish you more so
[40:20] bread and comfort you your hearts after
[40:22] that ye have passed on after that you
[40:24] shall pass on for therefore or you come
[40:26] to your service and they said so so do
[40:28] as thou has said
[40:31] can we can you see it can we can you see
[40:35] it in the scriptures can you see the
[40:38] Lord sitting there
[40:40] in the upper room
[40:42] with his disciples
[40:45] doing the same thing he's the same
[40:48] yesterday today and forever
[40:53] and Abraham hastened it to the tent to
[40:56] Sarah and said make ready quickly three
[40:58] measures of fine meal need it and make
[41:01] cakes upon the Earth just for cases
[41:03] sanctification baptism Holy Ghost
[41:05] produces the word of God in you that
[41:09] brings you to fruitation
[41:11] brings you to where you can trust God
[41:14] and you believe God regardless of what
[41:17] is going on if he is if he take if you
[41:20] have to leave this Earth You Can't Lose
[41:25] and I believe this is the time then and
[41:28] I pray and will the people you know he
[41:30] said he did say in every congregation
[41:32] they Believers make believe it's an
[41:34] unbelievers it always would be
[41:36] does that not make you desperate it
[41:39] makes me desperate Matthew 24 24 and I a
[41:42] couple of scripture scriptures up there
[41:44] he says that the Lord they'll say he's
[41:46] in the desert he's in the secret
[41:48] Chambers but don't you go there she
[41:51] signified to me that somebody's going to
[41:53] know not to travel that uh River Jordan
[41:56] still all they call them false doctors
[41:59] that God gave us Grace to set here we
[42:02] got to weak and hear a brother bring it
[42:04] down
[42:06] see God right listen God deal with me on
[42:10] something oh somebody in his church
[42:13] I don't even call his name because I
[42:15] mean you all probably Gonna Know It
[42:16] Anyway
[42:17] but you tell with me it's about
[42:19] something he placed him
[42:21] see see you need to be yes you got to be
[42:26] but say surely if I see a brother doing
[42:30] what God said he would be doing he's
[42:33] placing him
[42:36] sure
[42:39] God
[42:41] we need to see these things
[42:45] and Abraham ran into the herd and
[42:47] fishing cave tender and good and gave it
[42:51] and to the young man and he hastened to
[42:53] dress it and he took butter and milk in
[42:55] the cave which he had dressed and it
[42:57] types to me that we go eat and drink
[42:59] again listen they ate and it just out
[43:03] and it didn't have to use the bathroom
[43:07] so it tells me one day
[43:10] that I'm going to be in a place
[43:13] that if I eat something that I really
[43:15] gotta like
[43:16] it's going to be consumed
[43:18] there ain't gonna be no strain into it
[43:23] right and Abraham ran up to the herd
[43:24] fish and he took butter and milk and
[43:26] said it before him and he stood by them
[43:29] under the chin and they did eat and they
[43:30] said unto him were and listen how he
[43:33] said that and they said
[43:36] unto him horror
[43:40] is savior thy wife
[43:43] say you don't you don't listen to those
[43:46] little words
[43:47] when he said and he said behold in the
[43:50] tent and he said I will certainly return
[43:52] here listen and he said God said
[43:55] almighty God said the same one that said
[43:59] that he is your Shepherd
[44:02] you don't need to want nothing but him
[44:05] and he supplies every need that you have
[44:10] all right he'll Lead You by The Still
[44:12] Waters and Green Pastures and though you
[44:15] walk through the Shadows of the Valley
[44:16] of Death
[44:19] it will harm you how can it harm you you
[44:23] know the best he could do with the worst
[44:25] he could do it put you in the glory of
[44:27] God and think about that when this is
[44:30] finished
[44:31] in you and I when we have a complete
[44:34] revelation of Jesus Christ God almighty
[44:39] Colossians 1.
[44:42] Genesis 1 26 27 had waited been on so
[44:46] long
[44:47] that's who you're looking at because
[44:49] you've got to weed out these other gods
[44:53] I don't mean just in this Bible I'm
[44:55] talking about in your life
[44:59] yeah
[45:01] exactly right
[45:02] well if it's if it's if it's right it's
[45:05] right for me
[45:09] and he said I will certainly return unto
[45:11] thee
[45:13] according to the time of life hello
[45:15] Sarah thou why shall have a son now he
[45:19] couldn't kill Sara he couldn't kill her
[45:22] because he'd give it he just got through
[45:23] saying that she was going to have a son
[45:26] now he told you that if you would all if
[45:30] what you would do if you would repent
[45:32] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[45:34] Christ for admission your sins you shall
[45:36] receive the gift of the Holy Spirit
[45:39] and in the gift of the Holy Spirit you
[45:42] have you received the king Peter thinks
[45:44] that the Kings is water baptism is part
[45:46] of it but the keys is Jesus Christ amen
[45:49] amen there is what opens the door to the
[45:52] Keys open the door too
[45:56] but it don't stop there right
[45:58] he gives us but a Bobby gives us a
[46:01] complete revelation of Almighty
[46:04] all my actor where he put your name on
[46:06] his land book of life before the
[46:08] foundation of the world you see that you
[46:10] were his attribute that could nothing be
[46:13] added to or nothing took away how God
[46:16] could absolutely make a group of people
[46:19] here and a group of people here knowing
[46:21] everything they would do and he would
[46:23] not make you receive him he would not
[46:26] make either one of you do one thing but
[46:28] God you did it of your own free more
[46:30] agency your own choice and someday you
[46:34] go see that
[46:35] if you're going to change the Bible
[46:37] without dying
[46:40] you're going to see it you made the
[46:42] choice
[46:43] nobody made the choice you made the
[46:45] choice God presented a choice
[46:48] he presented it we're living our
[46:50] predestination
[46:55] okay
[46:58] now I didn't bring no watch
[47:01] but I don't think I'm gonna be here long
[47:03] anyway and Abraham and savior were old
[47:06] and well-stricken in age and if it cease
[47:10] to be with Sarah after the manner of
[47:13] women
[47:14] therefore Sarah life in herself within
[47:17] our sea of sin after I am wax oh I have
[47:21] pleasure my Lord also being old being
[47:24] old also and the Lord said unto Hebron
[47:27] this is everything that I'm saying I'm
[47:29] putting on this right here well there's
[47:31] one scripture
[47:32] and the Lord said
[47:35] they said okay where am I
[47:37] after and say her life with her and see
[47:39] if I'm a waxhold and the Lord said unto
[47:42] Abraham wherefore did Sarah life saying
[47:45] shall I of a surety bear a child which
[47:47] am old
[47:49] she doubted God she I mean she looked
[47:52] right there she I mean she was right
[47:54] there she hurt she seemed to wounded
[47:56] Abraham's see now I'm not down I'm not a
[48:00] bad math and Savor I'm saying that we
[48:02] aren't very careful we'll fall in the
[48:06] same category that Sarah did
[48:09] and if we doubt God or one eye holder we
[48:12] going by the ground the best we're going
[48:15] by the ground and we don't believe that
[48:17] God can bring us to a position
[48:19] like I was talking about a while ago
[48:21] give me a church full of the Holy Ghost
[48:24] see we had a church full of the Holy
[48:25] Ghost once it's 120 in upper room right
[48:31] he said give me one and he gives us time
[48:33] he give us type 30 no brother was
[48:35] talking about life in Ephesians
[48:38] I mean Israel always Through the Bible
[48:40] we go walk all the way through the Bible
[48:42] and God's showing us these things and
[48:45] God will bring us together he because he
[48:47] has foreigned us as with one another
[48:51] we're the the church that Jesus Christ
[48:53] is coming for is one with him and each
[48:57] other in him we're supposed to be coming
[49:00] together not magnetized apart or knocked
[49:04] apart by like turtle electricity
[49:08] there's a five-fold mission in this
[49:10] world and each one of them has got their
[49:13] part to Ministry
[49:15] and if if I listen if we reject
[49:19] either one of them in their message it
[49:22] could be speaking of our predestination
[49:26] you ever thought about that
[49:34] and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore
[49:37] disarray life saying shall I have a
[49:39] surety Bear Child which him old is
[49:42] anything too hard for the Lord
[49:44] now this is this is my scripture right
[49:46] here is anything
[49:48] too hard for the Lord
[49:52] right and listen I said is anything too
[49:54] hard for the Lord at the time appointed
[49:57] I will return unto the unto thee
[50:00] according to the time of life and Sarah
[50:03] shall have a son right then and he
[50:07] almost said he said then Sarah denied
[50:09] saying I laugh not but she for she was
[50:12] afraid and he said me but I did a Slave
[50:17] she thought lightly she just didn't
[50:20] believe it and then is this church I'm
[50:24] talking about the two Cadillacs again
[50:27] do do we just hope that we're of this
[50:30] Cadillac is on the right
[50:32] is that is that what we have is this a
[50:35] hope now if it's the hope of Hebrews 11
[50:40] faith is a substance of things hoped for
[50:43] the evidence of Things Not Seen
[50:47] if we got the faith we it must have the
[50:51] substance which is God and then if we
[50:53] got the substance of God in the faith of
[50:55] God we can count on him for anything
[50:59] but when you ask God for something you
[51:02] have to stand there on it until he comes
[51:04] to it because he's the only manifester
[51:07] of the word
[51:08] and I'm going to tell you something else
[51:10] old age ain't got nothing to do with the
[51:13] rapture
[51:15] yes sir I mean listen I know that I
[51:18] ain't 20 years old no more
[51:20] but I know God is eternal
[51:24] the one that's inside of me and you
[51:25] brought Sam is eternal
[51:28] that's the interstate 126.
[51:31] and he's began to separate himself in
[51:33] Genesis 2 7 right
[51:36] multiply himself
[51:40] and he still multiply as far as I know
[51:42] but you know I'm going to test him as it
[51:44] was in the days of Noah so sad to being
[51:46] a covenant son of man
[51:48] and how many of us can can also say that
[51:52] we don't say it's a Sodom and condition
[51:54] in the world today
[51:59] he said he said except the Lord
[52:01] shortened the days no flesh wouldn't be
[52:04] saved can we see that
[52:11] okay
[52:13] okay this is this is something bro Sam
[52:16] just mentioned here the other day and I
[52:19] I preach on it for quite some time
[52:22] it's a in the season out there with a
[52:24] shook
[52:25] now do and I'm gonna ask you do you
[52:28] understand what they are now I've got in
[52:30] trouble asking people Christians I've
[52:33] got that trouble well they're they'll
[52:35] say something to me and I said well what
[52:37] do you think about so-and-so
[52:39] they shed it up I just clamp and never
[52:41] say another word to me never
[52:43] I've had them for years go years not
[52:46] saying nothing it just shut me off and
[52:48] what if I was telling the truth
[52:51] okay
[52:54] this is a seed not here with the shook
[52:57] there's there's the secret of the
[53:00] message now this is paragraph 152 or or
[53:02] it says 105.2 I don't know which one it
[53:05] is uh just exactly the father's business
[53:08] now there is a secret of the message now
[53:10] just exactly the father's business what
[53:13] is a father's business could you think
[53:16] of what the father's business was to him
[53:18] to fulfill what Isaiah said
[53:21] now think think on Hezekiah
[53:25] Hezekiah and I I mentioned this on
[53:28] several I didn't really get down on it
[53:30] like I really wanted to but he he was he
[53:33] pleased God
[53:35] I mean he done the things of God had
[53:37] parents of God he he'd done all the
[53:39] things he done with God and then when it
[53:41] comes to time for him to die God because
[53:43] God knows all things he sent Isaiah
[53:46] there and he turned he turned his face
[53:48] to the wall and began to pray
[53:50] and say God you you know that I've done
[53:53] this I've done this and he didn't say he
[53:55] didn't do it right
[53:56] but see God Knows Best
[53:58] so when we pray we all say not my will
[54:01] Lord thine will be done because I
[54:03] wouldn't if I'd been I as a kind I
[54:06] wouldn't want to stay here and done the
[54:07] things that he done right
[54:10] right would you now listen when the
[54:12] wisest mens in the world besides Jesus
[54:14] Christ was a Solomon
[54:17] would you wanted to do would you really
[54:19] wanted his job
[54:22] think about it I mean just think about
[54:24] it look what Solomon did in the latter
[54:26] part of his life
[54:29] we don't want to wind up this way that's
[54:31] why I'm preaching like I'm preaching and
[54:33] that's why these brothers is doing the
[54:34] same thing I like with brother Bob I see
[54:36] him brother Bob up here that pouring his
[54:38] heart out he's he's an emotional brother
[54:40] and and
[54:42] yeah you wouldn't believe I am would you
[54:45] but I am I really am but I'll tell you
[54:48] what I mean I I love to see a person I
[54:53] I've seen in every one of you Brothers I
[54:55] mean and I've seen it and me and Danny
[54:57] was talking here the other day and God
[54:59] what a blessed God I mean that he even
[55:02] brought him into my life and and I could
[55:05] say each one of you what what a what a
[55:08] what mercy and Grace God has given me
[55:15] is his precious bark I mean you I I
[55:18] can't tell you how much I love and how
[55:20] much I pray for you
[55:22] you're in the constantly before my face
[55:29] now there's a secret of the message now
[55:31] he fixing to bring the secret of the
[55:33] message if you'll go to the 13th chapter
[55:35] of Matthew and read schofield's notes
[55:37] you'll see the the Mysteries there that
[55:40] brother Branham took them and wrote them
[55:41] down and put them in surgeons it's the
[55:43] time but he preached on them
[55:45] by Revelation Schofield put him down and
[55:48] had a great understanding of it
[55:51] but we have been blessed
[55:53] to have a prophet of God the prophet of
[55:56] God for our day see so that there's
[55:59] there's more is given more as he
[56:01] expected
[56:03] there's a there's a cigarette of the
[56:05] mission and just as actually father's
[56:06] business what is the Father's
[56:08] could you think of what the father's
[56:09] business was to him a virgin shall
[56:11] conceive fulfill what Isaiah said the
[56:13] lame shall leap like a heart and I'll
[56:16] and and look at these things and uh
[56:20] just let me stay with you and all these
[56:22] things that take place like Moses said
[56:24] the Lord your God shall raise up a
[56:26] prophet among you like unto me
[56:28] even the father's business to fulfill
[56:30] that word for his day
[56:32] so we gotta we got a word to fulfill for
[56:34] our day
[56:36] God to believe God over what Sarah did
[56:41] right and again I say I'm not down in
[56:44] Sarah say that's what Sarah saw why and
[56:46] I said the last time I was speaking I
[56:48] said you know she only live what was 37
[56:51] years after the change
[56:54] she was well old enough young enough to
[56:57] have all them children Abraham had with
[56:59] another woman now I don't know that
[57:02] but but I certainly think about it so
[57:05] there's things that we can we can do
[57:10] we must stand correction according to
[57:12] Hebrews 12. for every son that comes to
[57:15] God must be chasten to God tested tide
[57:18] and proven corrected
[57:20] and if we don't do that it's proven Who
[57:23] We Are
[57:29] if that comes down through them stalks
[57:31] of them Natural Women what about these
[57:33] stalks are these Spiritual Church women
[57:36] Church means women women means churches
[57:38] rather is that right then what is it now
[57:40] we must be about the father's business
[57:42] if we would cry back the grain yes sir
[57:44] what what must it do
[57:47] vindicate Malachi 4 do we as each
[57:52] individual sit here do we know what the
[57:54] message of Malachi 4 is do we know I'm
[57:57] asking you now you ain't going to say a
[57:59] word
[58:01] but if you don't
[58:03] you better get busy because this is a
[58:06] requirement
[58:07] we're to Vindicated Malachi 4.
[58:10] now you go uh three what 336
[58:14] he says that this is this is this is I
[58:17] got it in my notes here he said it's
[58:19] actually a a a a special class of people
[58:23] that's uh that how do you say that uh
[58:28] special designation of himself the
[58:31] church you know he makes a church a
[58:32] president a present destination if he
[58:36] said if I got the words right but it's
[58:38] him he absolutely comes on the scene
[58:42] because we fulfill the son of man
[58:44] Ministry in Luke 17 30 tells us here it
[58:48] says Luke 17 30. vindicate Hebrews 13 8.
[58:53] see if you if you'll get it all together
[58:55] you're right there in Hebrews 13 8.
[59:00] if you'll get it all together you'll be
[59:02] able to go over here all the way to
[59:04] where he'd be scared to come to sin down
[59:06] and see who he is and what he is and how
[59:09] he is and what are you doing and how
[59:10] he's doing it and why you've done it for
[59:13] right and don't say
[59:15] I can't see that
[59:17] don't do that
[59:19] don't do that
[59:21] you can see it now now like Brazil said
[59:23] he says we're not on the same level but
[59:25] I'll tell you what when the headship
[59:27] comes
[59:29] there's a headship just uh uh just
[59:31] anoint uh the uh the ministry
[59:34] all right in the upper room there they
[59:37] were 120 and a lot of them was women
[59:39] do you believe that they was all in the
[59:41] faith of the fathers
[59:45] they was
[59:48] and but they had their special jobs all
[59:51] of them didn't preach but all of them
[59:53] lived
[59:55] there are the Christ the son of the
[59:56] Living God
[1:00:00] John 14 12.
[1:00:02] then vindicate all of his words
[1:00:05] Hebrew vindicate Hebrews Revelation to
[1:00:08] 10th chapter now now there's a mighty
[1:00:12] angel
[1:00:13] that comes down descends in a cloud
[1:00:15] we've seen that
[1:00:17] I was alive anyway I didn't see it but I
[1:00:20] know it happened because if God gave me
[1:00:22] a revelation
[1:00:24] February 28 1963 he descended like he
[1:00:28] ascended up right now
[1:00:31] my brother was a prophet of God was told
[1:00:34] to go back to Jeffersonville right he
[1:00:36] preached him seals he did
[1:00:39] so that's how long he's been Church he's
[1:00:41] given us plenty of time he says now if
[1:00:44] he's here I'll be leaving you for good
[1:00:46] right two of us can't be here at the
[1:00:48] same time
[1:00:50] before you see
[1:00:54] so uh
[1:00:56] where are we say it
[1:00:57] what do we know what we don't know now
[1:01:00] if we don't know we ought to be
[1:01:01] desperate I'll tell you one thing I've
[1:01:03] had this brother right here preach a
[1:01:04] many a Time
[1:01:05] and I said I challenge her whoa
[1:01:08] I mean I'm telling you truth and God was
[1:01:10] blessing me God I'm going to tell you
[1:01:11] what God turned with me one time I will
[1:01:13] say this part
[1:01:15] me and my wife was it was
[1:01:18] had gone to bed
[1:01:19] and and obviously I always sometimes I
[1:01:22] stay a week two hour two three whatever
[1:01:25] it was talking to God and he showed me
[1:01:27] he said I'm going to send you
[1:01:29] under set you under a Ministry
[1:01:32] that's going to bring you out of Egypt
[1:01:37] now as far as I go with it
[1:01:40] but see only God
[1:01:43] he said I'm gonna send you and I'm gonna
[1:01:46] go with you and I'm gonna make sure that
[1:01:49] you're there and I'm gonna make sure
[1:01:50] that he preaches it
[1:01:54] it happened right
[1:01:56] does anybody ever speak to you that way
[1:01:58] do you do you tonight right here in this
[1:02:01] congregation has God spoke to you and
[1:02:03] told you he's bringing you all I've read
[1:02:05] scriptures I've been reading it all over
[1:02:10] amen you know you're just coming to
[1:02:12] church right it ain't just preaching the
[1:02:14] same old thing
[1:02:16] because a lot of times we think so but
[1:02:18] it takes a lot of doing right right to
[1:02:21] get it done
[1:02:24] Revelation 10th chapter the opening the
[1:02:27] Seven Seals and all and all the
[1:02:28] Mysteries even the serpent seed and all
[1:02:31] would be manifested
[1:02:33] marriage and divorce
[1:02:35] you know I've got wrote all over my
[1:02:38] books all up through the years I said
[1:02:40] the true revelation of marriage divorce
[1:02:42] to take you into rapture
[1:02:47] the absolute truth of Revelation I mean
[1:02:51] uh Romans 7
[1:02:53] and the message Imagine The Voice
[1:02:57] invisible Union it'll bring you right on
[1:03:00] out to the other end amen
[1:03:02] amen see but if you ain't no desperation
[1:03:05] you ain't gonna get to because real
[1:03:06] Brown said no desperation
[1:03:09] you perish without desperation you
[1:03:11] perish
[1:03:13] and and if we get to thought that we
[1:03:16] can't do it
[1:03:18] we made a serious seriously we're
[1:03:20] telling God he can't do something
[1:03:26] okay let me just go here marriage and
[1:03:29] divorce and all these other Mysteries
[1:03:31] that's been hid under the pillars from
[1:03:33] all these years from the theologians and
[1:03:36] so forth but it's now the hour that's
[1:03:39] the father's business
[1:03:40] I think they would receive it
[1:03:45] they want to be dignified say our
[1:03:47] denomination don't teach us that or let
[1:03:50] me say this way let me say it put it
[1:03:52] this way we'll say well big boy speak
[1:03:55] for yourself
[1:04:00] and what if that big boy was speaking
[1:04:02] for God right
[1:04:04] right and I believe he was
[1:04:06] but the Bible does that's right God
[1:04:09] vindicates it to be the true and he did
[1:04:12] that amen amen you're the way he did
[1:04:14] that I was sitting there I was standing
[1:04:17] there I was there
[1:04:19] and and when once somebody gets off the
[1:04:21] word if they will not straighten up
[1:04:24] according to Hebrews 12 they gonna get
[1:04:26] further and further and further and
[1:04:29] further until they don't even look like
[1:04:30] the same person
[1:04:35] thank you
[1:04:36] fulfill this age when the Seven Seals
[1:04:39] are just proven the denominations has
[1:04:40] just been carriers how many times has my
[1:04:43] brother brought down that's another one
[1:04:45] of the father's businesses
[1:04:48] the father's business now is to show you
[1:04:50] them denomination is not his
[1:04:53] Glory now I just gotta I just got
[1:04:55] through Reading Isaiah 43 and we can go
[1:04:59] on and go chapter on chapter on chapter
[1:05:02] on chapter on chapter right over to the
[1:05:04] says if you add anything to this word
[1:05:06] this book or takes anything away the
[1:05:10] plagues of this book will be added to
[1:05:11] you your name be took out the book of
[1:05:13] life we can do that
[1:05:15] and somebody somebody gonna stand here
[1:05:18] more elegant with me
[1:05:22] amen and they're going to lay this down
[1:05:24] there and we're going to come back
[1:05:26] because I've never heard my pastor say
[1:05:29] one time in all the many many many many
[1:05:32] years that I've been here that he
[1:05:34] couldn't learn something new from God
[1:05:39] and and unfortunately
[1:05:41] a lot of us think we we got it
[1:05:48] their man-made systems that deny the
[1:05:51] words now we can be as man-made as any
[1:05:54] denomination across the street or up to
[1:05:57] a country or wherever we have got to
[1:06:00] come to the fullness of the revelation
[1:06:02] of Jesus Christ this here Plus
[1:06:06] those Thunders
[1:06:08] because if the first Thunder under the
[1:06:11] first seal a lamb stood there with a
[1:06:14] book in his hand and said there goes a
[1:06:16] white horse rider see there it's another
[1:06:18] person right
[1:06:30] well
[1:06:33] let me finish this part here up
[1:06:35] I'm almost I I I I won't even
[1:06:42] a virgin shall conceive
[1:06:44] she conceived that was a father's
[1:06:47] business
[1:06:59] now this is sardisian church age uh page
[1:07:03] 265.
[1:07:05] you know we are living in the end time
[1:07:07] it is in this age that the churches are
[1:07:09] going to come together
[1:07:10] and as they are now I've saved all this
[1:07:12] for last that's why I was stumbling so
[1:07:14] much I wanted to get to this but but I I
[1:07:17] had I tried my best to lay that to lay
[1:07:20] something down because you've got to see
[1:07:22] that you can do it you got to see that
[1:07:25] you're part of him you got to see that
[1:07:28] he put your name on the lounge Book of
[1:07:30] Life if you don't see it How You Gonna
[1:07:32] Know It
[1:07:35] God wants somebody that he can
[1:07:37] Fellowship like he did with Abraham he
[1:07:40] wanted to favor a fellowship with Sarah
[1:07:42] but Sarah had left she didn't laugh but
[1:07:46] she doubted
[1:07:48] if we ain't careful we'll do the same
[1:07:50] thing
[1:07:52] okay let me see
[1:07:54] now you know where I live at the end
[1:07:56] time is this age the churches are going
[1:07:58] to come together and as they are even
[1:08:00] now control the world politics they will
[1:08:02] soon control the finances of the world
[1:08:05] what's going on
[1:08:06] are we blind that we can't see
[1:08:11] if you don't belong to the world
[1:08:13] organization of churches you won't be
[1:08:15] able to buy or sale
[1:08:18] he says bride here twice
[1:08:21] you will lose all those who stay true to
[1:08:25] God and keep their garments clean from
[1:08:26] the defilement of this world system
[1:08:28] churches Church order will be physically
[1:08:31] bereth
[1:08:33] now how are you going to know
[1:08:36] if you don't know him right
[1:08:41] right there will be a presented to them
[1:08:43] a great temptation to give in
[1:08:45] preaching will give in with the excuse
[1:08:47] that they will serve God within the
[1:08:49] framework of the Antichrist Beast system
[1:08:51] listen this ain't going to be it's like
[1:08:53] in Deuteronomy 13 there or or First
[1:08:57] Kings 13. see Deuteronomy said if a if a
[1:09:01] preacher if a dreamer or a prophet tells
[1:09:04] you something that's going to come to
[1:09:05] True come to pass and it comes to pass
[1:09:08] and takes you to another God now listen
[1:09:10] this ain't taking you to Buddhism
[1:09:13] we're over here in Asia we're living now
[1:09:16] see us in that River Jordan ain't taking
[1:09:18] me nowhere
[1:09:20] he said it's going to get much closer
[1:09:22] than that brother dick
[1:09:24] I mean you can absolutely organize your
[1:09:28] own own person right
[1:09:33] right and the best you can hope for
[1:09:35] right is go by the ground and I don't
[1:09:37] believe I believe every one of us and I
[1:09:39] with all my heart I pray this little
[1:09:43] group
[1:09:44] and I know Brother Sam and waiting and
[1:09:46] Bob and Eric it feels the same way
[1:09:49] they will give in to flatterers and
[1:09:51] banishments of the hierarchy that people
[1:09:53] will follow these false Shepherds right
[1:09:55] into the slaughter whoa a shepherd
[1:09:58] false Shepherd it ain't like Balaam his
[1:10:02] own his son went so far past Balaam and
[1:10:05] Jezebel he's so close to able to see the
[1:10:08] elected and he was so close that if he
[1:10:10] don't shorten the days ain't no flesh
[1:10:12] gonna be saved right now what else what
[1:10:15] kind of people ought that to make us
[1:10:16] brother
[1:10:19] what should that do to us
[1:10:23] should he bring
[1:10:25] Godly sincere desperation
[1:10:30] should it should we begin to
[1:10:34] spend more time with God
[1:10:37] instead of ever think in the world
[1:10:41] this I know people has to work
[1:10:43] but I listened
[1:10:45] Sam knows it's true I was out there with
[1:10:48] him I was all over him

[1:13:32] wisdom that you get
[1:13:35] there ain't no big eyes in little use
[1:13:45] 172. notice the harmony of the father
[1:13:48] and the son
[1:13:50] see this is this is what I'm saying uh
[1:13:53] in Psalms 23.
[1:13:55] this is where I started from
[1:13:57] I brought it back to Daniel 9 24. see we
[1:14:01] I believe with all my heart that we
[1:14:03] finished the book
[1:14:05] we finished the book here he was here's
[1:14:07] Daniel 9 24. that's the I could only be
[1:14:09] Jesus Christ the son of man he come into
[1:14:12] this world he did his job and he he did
[1:14:14] everything that he was supposed to do
[1:14:16] knowing at all was going to happen and
[1:14:18] he would have he left something for us
[1:14:19] to do we come through the ages he said
[1:14:22] he we talked about uh uh trumpet with
[1:14:25] Sam
[1:14:27] he said
[1:14:28] a sword open
[1:14:29] a message would come forth a mystery he
[1:14:33] said he did it be a group of people that
[1:14:35] would receive it and be sealed away
[1:14:37] there'd be a group of people that
[1:14:39] rejected in their silhouette and a
[1:14:41] plague would fall on them it's still
[1:14:44] going on Church
[1:14:45] he said a gospel Trump the Lord himself
[1:14:48] she had a sin with a child divorce all
[1:14:49] gain that Trump of God God a gospel
[1:14:52] trumpet well had he descended to you and
[1:14:54] me and he justified us he Sanctified us
[1:14:56] he filled us with his spirit
[1:14:58] he's led us brother and besides it still
[1:15:01] waters oh God he listen nothing can harm
[1:15:06] us
[1:15:07] right if this body goes down
[1:15:09] right back up
[1:15:14] for sale he get his name fear and we
[1:15:17] have to stop fearing him
[1:15:20] faith is not made perfect and fear
[1:15:22] sister Gail
[1:15:24] it's not we have to quit fearing him
[1:15:26] brother Bradley he said boo you know he
[1:15:29] kind of he's a boo back he got boo-boo
[1:15:32] and he just got his what nothing all
[1:15:33] right
[1:15:34] so well that was brother Brown well in
[1:15:37] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:15:38] angel when he began to sound all the
[1:15:41] Mysteries that had been told by the
[1:15:44] prophets that would be revealed and we
[1:15:46] received the sounding of the voice and
[1:15:49] the revelation of the mistress
[1:15:52] that's what we do that's what we're
[1:15:54] called to Sister yeah
[1:15:55] bro tomorrow we're called to we're
[1:15:57] called and if God promised it and he
[1:15:59] called us to it this is the age of the
[1:16:01] time for it we can do it
[1:16:06] but we'll leave here and a lot of time
[1:16:09] and and we go out wondering
[1:16:13] what did that brother mean
[1:16:15] listen
[1:16:17] let me finish this up
[1:16:19] I think they will receive it they don't
[1:16:22] want to be deep they don't want it
[1:16:23] they're too dignified
[1:16:25] fulfilling this age when the seven
[1:16:27] centers are just proving the
[1:16:28] denominations had just been carriers
[1:16:32] let me see where I'm at now
[1:16:41] I know I'd have lost everything over
[1:16:43] there
[1:16:44] uh
[1:16:55] okay
[1:16:57] he says he didn't win this message and
[1:16:59] uh and I was thinking about the
[1:17:01] countdown he says you can have the Holy
[1:17:03] Spirit every hour you live die and miss
[1:17:05] it and go to hell try that one on Church
[1:17:09] right now he said that's what he told
[1:17:10] that's what he he preached to the people
[1:17:13] he said you can have the Holy Ghost
[1:17:16] every hour that you live the Holy Spirit
[1:17:20] he even said her he said now being born
[1:17:22] again and the new birth is different
[1:17:24] explaining that one to him but by the
[1:17:26] grace of God he's got it in his place he
[1:17:28] explained it
[1:17:30] but we don't read
[1:17:33] we don't listen that's why I still like
[1:17:35] to read Because I make notes I can't
[1:17:37] hardly make notes off a computer for me
[1:17:39] you know
[1:17:41] because let people a lot smaller than I
[1:17:43] am
[1:17:50] I said uh uh paragraph 189 I got 102. I
[1:17:53] don't know what type two words are what
[1:17:55] is it you've got to get with the word to
[1:17:57] get yourself killed out I'm persuaded
[1:18:00] that many of his friends have received
[1:18:01] the Holy Ghost but we just receive
[1:18:03] enough holy ghost in us to make us to a
[1:18:04] place where we want to lie we don't want
[1:18:07] to lie we don't want to steal we don't
[1:18:09] want to do anything but God wants to
[1:18:11] feel every fiber of his church now this
[1:18:15] if it's anything I could say to you this
[1:18:17] is what I say I said everything I've
[1:18:20] said that God wants to feel every fiber
[1:18:23] this is the this is the plan this is
[1:18:26] what he was going to achieve that he had
[1:18:29] in his mind before there was ever World
[1:18:31] barrier brother he said in Christ the
[1:18:33] minister God filled a bride we are we're
[1:18:36] part of the mystery and must be revealed
[1:18:41] thank you Lord
[1:18:44] but we just received it just enough to
[1:18:47] get a sort of place we don't want to lie
[1:18:48] we don't want to steal we don't want but
[1:18:49] God wants to fill every fiber of his
[1:18:51] church he wants to feel your thinking
[1:18:55] let's see now he said feel
[1:18:57] f i l l feel
[1:19:00] he wants to be in control of your
[1:19:03] thinking
[1:19:05] he wants to fill your mind what did I
[1:19:08] say while ago I said faith comes by here
[1:19:10] and you hear the word by anointed person
[1:19:14] of anointing minister of God and it
[1:19:17] could be the one sitting next to you
[1:19:18] that gives you something that he's heard
[1:19:20] him say it that God will revealed it to
[1:19:23] you because it travels through the body
[1:19:25] the word travels through the body
[1:19:28] he wants to fill every bit of you just
[1:19:31] make you completely totally dead to
[1:19:33] yourself out to your thinking just so
[1:19:36] Serenity in God till his word just
[1:19:38] living right through you you don't know
[1:19:40] nothing else but God's word
[1:19:43] just stay right with his word it is life
[1:19:46] my words are alive said Jesus he's
[1:19:49] placed them teachers believe in the
[1:19:51] Bible prophecy say the truth that say
[1:19:53] this show the same prophecy that they
[1:19:55] always did down through the age what's
[1:19:57] he done he's showing himself
[1:20:00] alive among them confirming his word his
[1:20:03] word the kingdom of God and God's word
[1:20:06] made Power Hebrew 13 8. he's the same
[1:20:10] yesterday today and forever
[1:20:13] listen we're all falling apart
[1:20:17] uh this is the number two book uh
[1:20:23] 11 27. it's almost it may be almost past
[1:20:28] fitting time now this this uh
[1:20:33] could it be
[1:20:34] there was a time
[1:20:38] that God told Noah you preached long
[1:20:41] enough now
[1:20:43] You Preach You Preach for 120 years
[1:20:45] you're my faithful servant
[1:20:47] Rodeo for his faithful servant
[1:20:50] all of you
[1:20:53] he said now I want you to go into art
[1:20:56] I'm going to close the door
[1:20:59] it was seven days nothing happened
[1:21:02] that was showing on our side
[1:21:06] and then North Third pool began to speak
[1:21:09] that he is he says you'd either do this
[1:21:12] or God's going to open up the skies
[1:21:15] you're gonna die
[1:21:17] and I'm saying right here now in this
[1:21:19] little group of people surely I mean in
[1:21:23] my heart surely Lord there's nobody here
[1:21:25] that don't love you
[1:21:29] surely there's nobody here that don't
[1:21:31] want more of a more of a relationship
[1:21:34] with you Lord
[1:21:35] that you that wants such a relationship
[1:21:38] with you that God that you could they
[1:21:41] could be sitting there and it's sitting
[1:21:43] there and they're reaching catch you by
[1:21:45] the hand
[1:21:46] he said
[1:21:47] I do it many many times
[1:21:50] that that angel of God is encountered
[1:21:52] about those who fear and love the Lord
[1:21:54] then I can touch him
[1:21:57] I can believe him
[1:21:59] I I don't I don't want to believe me
[1:22:02] I believe me too much and it's cost me
[1:22:05] too much trouble I want to believe God
[1:22:10] I got to watch by laying these glasses
[1:22:12] down
[1:22:15] okay
[1:22:19] okay let me finish this it may be almost
[1:22:21] past feeling time see because there will
[1:22:23] come a time like that when the spirit of
[1:22:25] God will will be with taken from the
[1:22:27] Earth
[1:22:28] there will be no more now listen close
[1:22:30] church the church will remain a while
[1:22:34] that's right preaching because it has to
[1:22:37] preach to the eternally lost that's
[1:22:39] going on now he now listen to he says
[1:22:42] just as every Ministry did coming down
[1:22:45] through the age the last part of every
[1:22:48] Ministry preached to the Eternal loss
[1:22:50] and they will be a minister now they
[1:22:52] will preached to the Eternal loss after
[1:22:54] they have refused to receive it
[1:23:03] I'm finishing up Church
[1:23:06] I want you to I want to I want to say
[1:23:08] this to you
[1:23:09] when uh Moses went over
[1:23:13] uh when when Israel got
[1:23:16] desperate enough
[1:23:18] they're in in Egypt
[1:23:20] and they must have really got desperate
[1:23:24] because God come down to Moses you know
[1:23:27] in the burning bush
[1:23:29] he said I've heard the Cry of my people
[1:23:32] that's right that's right I'm going to
[1:23:35] deliver Moses
[1:23:36] and I'm going to send you now
[1:23:39] now that God has done the same thing in
[1:23:43] Ephesians 4.
[1:23:45] he said I've heard the Cry of my people
[1:23:48] now I've sent my prophet
[1:23:51] I've seen him
[1:23:53] now from here I'm going to sit in the
[1:23:55] church Apostles prophets of his passion
[1:23:58] and teachers
[1:24:01] because I want him prepared
[1:24:04] and this is the only way they can be
[1:24:06] prepared
[1:24:09] are you we Witnesses of this right
[1:24:15] now where they was coming out you know
[1:24:17] all that they've done they they they
[1:24:19] they
[1:24:20] Aaron made the the uh the golden calf
[1:24:24] and he he he
[1:24:26] told if you know the scriptures I'm
[1:24:29] telling you the truth boy you he says he
[1:24:31] just jumped out to fire I mean it's
[1:24:34] amazing I mean this was somebody that
[1:24:36] God said you be you be the prophet and
[1:24:39] God Moses be God to you you know so but
[1:24:43] you you know all these things that
[1:24:45] happen but what he done he is he told
[1:24:48] Moses he says I'm sending you you go get
[1:24:51] my people and bring them to this
[1:24:52] mountain right
[1:24:54] now this I'm official with this
[1:24:57] you you bring them to dismountable
[1:25:00] now by the time they got to that
[1:25:02] mountain do you know the condition they
[1:25:04] was in
[1:25:06] yeah and the fear that they had of God
[1:25:11] listen if they had a walk before God
[1:25:14] like God wanted him to walk before him
[1:25:16] they wouldn't have had that fear they
[1:25:18] would have had the love of God and when
[1:25:20] when they the the mountain was was was
[1:25:24] thundered and quaking I mean that can
[1:25:27] you imagine a person that's lost
[1:25:30] she's looking I said don't let God speak
[1:25:34] we'll die unless we die let Moses speak
[1:25:37] there was a lick of Fire
[1:25:40] if they had to come correctly there was
[1:25:42] a lick of fire for every one of them
[1:25:43] right there
[1:25:45] fear would have been goals it's the
[1:25:47] truth
[1:25:48] they wouldn't have no fear except
[1:25:50] displeasing God now I'm saying here here
[1:25:54] we are
[1:25:55] 120 that all that was there was filled
[1:25:59] with the holy spirit with that liquor
[1:26:00] fire
[1:26:01] he's come down to us now to fulfill this
[1:26:04] thing
[1:26:05] to make manifests the word of God
[1:26:12] are we up for the task
[1:26:18] he said and all the people saw the
[1:26:19] thunderings
[1:26:21] enlightenments and the noise of the
[1:26:23] trumpet and the mountain smoking and
[1:26:25] when the people saw it they removed and
[1:26:27] stood a far off
[1:26:29] and they said unto Moses speak thou for
[1:26:32] with us and we will hear but let not God
[1:26:34] speak with us lest we die
[1:26:39] and Moses said unto the people fear not
[1:26:41] see he he was there he was I mean God
[1:26:44] had him standing there fear enough for
[1:26:46] God has come to prove you and and that
[1:26:50] his fear may be before your faces that
[1:26:52] ye sin not and the people stood afar off
[1:26:55] and Moses Drew near to the thick
[1:26:57] Darkness where God was and the Lord said
[1:26:59] unto Moses now because God accepted I
[1:27:02] mean accepted Moses and the Lord said
[1:27:04] unto Moses thus thy shall say unto the
[1:27:07] children of Israel ye have seen that I
[1:27:09] have talked with you from Heaven you
[1:27:11] shall not make with me gods of silver
[1:27:13] neither shall you make unto you gods of
[1:27:16] gold
[1:27:18] and of course he goes on and on and on I
[1:27:21] mean it's it's just so much uh that but
[1:27:24] uh that brother uh Joseph did you uh did
[1:27:28] you happen to get these these two uh
[1:27:31] tongues and interpretations
[1:27:33] uh that I had on the Blasphemous names
[1:27:36] and uh uh the way back
[1:27:40] if he didn't I'm gonna read him are they
[1:27:41] up there okay that's it I want you to
[1:27:43] listen there's a story here about this
[1:27:47] many years ago Pig and I would listen to
[1:27:50] uh I just about wore out last famous
[1:27:53] names I did statute perfect man and at
[1:27:56] the back of it at the back of the
[1:27:58] message it had a a a a person speaking
[1:28:02] with tongues and a person interpreted
[1:28:06] now I've got it here so I took it off I
[1:28:09] told Peggy I said Peggy let's let's get

[1:29:00] you if you add unto this book or you
[1:29:02] take away what he's here's what happened
[1:29:03] and I say about the prophet's message if
[1:29:06] God used somebody through the gift to
[1:29:10] bring to tugs and interpretation and
[1:29:13] somebody was so brave that they could
[1:29:16] take it off that God come to on the
[1:29:18] scene and and Vindicated what had been
[1:29:21] preached by this

[1:29:53] now of course we can't have the in
[1:29:56] tongues but we do have the
[1:29:58] interpretation and I know it's true
[1:30:01] because I heard it

[1:30:31] those that will not come under my
[1:30:33] jurisdiction I cannot stand those that
[1:30:35] will not be obedient to my calling I
[1:30:38] cannot stand the ones that have not
[1:30:40] believed in my word I cannot stand
[1:30:42] though that will not accept the

[1:35:19] left to us to enter into his wrist as
[1:35:21] you should seem to come short of it
[1:35:25] For unto us was the Gospel priest as
[1:35:27] well as unto them but the word priest
[1:35:30] did not profit them not being mixed with
[1:35:32] knowledge
[1:35:33] wisdom faith in them faith in them

[1:36:10] God hearing on tape too do you know
[1:36:13] where you stand
[1:36:15] do you know that you are called of God
[1:36:17] that the Holy Ghost Reigns in your heart
[1:36:19] and every word of God is real to you
[1:36:23] oh brother how's Satan going to stand
[1:36:26] against that how is he going to stop
[1:36:28] that from growing how is he going to
[1:36:30] keep them signs from father
[1:36:32] and he goes on down here and talk about
[1:36:34] who he's called he's Justified and so
