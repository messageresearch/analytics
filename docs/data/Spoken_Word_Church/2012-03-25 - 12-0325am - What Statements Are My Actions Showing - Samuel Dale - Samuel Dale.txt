[Applause] [Music] desire their heart to see you good to see you but in it how's the Lord you like turning your scriptures turn to acts 13 and remember the weight and you'll be traveling back from brother imagem I didn't remember the announcements that terraces might about this the eating Demming and the associate down into chicken house there Lulla deal food while we're having our Easter time together and remember that the Bible study will be that afternoon you know while we're having the time together so just keep these these things in your mind men x13 trying to make sure I get all the announcements father we thank you for your loving your grace we thank you for this day and we thank you for the time that you've given us thank you for the opportunity to be able to gather together this morning to be able to speak about you and your Lord to let you direct each thought in mind as we would Lord desire to hear from you speak to our hearts this morning because that's our desire more than anything in the world that we may Lord see you living among us forgive our sins mess your little right around the world and that's not hard to do because you promised you would that we depend upon that promise just have your way now and keep us lead us and I'll understanding as we read you your word you give us your understanding of that word we commit it to you now let's wait there tonight as you'll be ministering the Lord just bless and guide each one and he puts all in Jesus name Amen thanks 13 the anodd scripture be an on-message this one may yes so take a vacation and then from ministering for a while and then come back and then we can get started back in the Lord yo so we're going to acts 13 verse 14 and when they departed from burger and they came to any hot impress idea we see Abraham pronouncing went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat down and I after the reading of the law of the prophets the rulers of the single synagogue sealing to them saying you men and brethren if you have any word of exhortation for the people say own then Paul stood up and beckoning with his hands men of Israel you that fear God give audience you may be seated the more that is messing to the reading of the word they said it did make the announcement that the brother over live in Afghanistan that they they killed him is that way to say it well according to brother Richard Wilson he called him and you know we don't know which ones water what but that was a believer in the message that was over there so that's what we we've the last part that we found he said to take holding that from from Jeff that net was a believer dark so just Aaron said remember the family and just prayed the Lord would bless you know you know you know yes we're we don't live in those kind of countries we live in a freedom country and we better be sure it's our freedom to be able to speak our mind and our thoughts and all and until this time at least you know she'll just just pray for the family they meant now I said it would be a very odd message this morning because I want you to pay close attention and I want everybody here to not only those that are on the internet of a family today listening that are not able to come but I want to make sure that everybody hears this message today because it'll be a message from my hardest little back I guess two or three months that I've been thinking on this though they came to me you know that's just a thought so I want to express it to you you know Paul here in the scripture that says that you know they came to this place and they they did and it says Paul beckoning with his hands in other words he gave a sign he gave a sign out to the people you know I want to speak many are he may be his sign was to hold your peace while I speak or whatever it was but it said that he was beckoning hand and you know then he began to sleep and de Klerk his message under the people well now this is the statement that I want to make to you today because it's an art statement called a float and talk about statement Oh what statements I'm asking a question what statements are my actions chewy right what statements then we live in a day in a time when you know the kids going down the streets they have the pants fall down they you know right they're walking along with long higher our girls with short higher they got purple higher they got blue higher they got green higher they've got all kind of doings and wearing all kinds of clothes and if you say something to them about it what do they say they say I'm making a statement all right and I you know I went to Webster to see what it is um you know like a statement is soccer will you get you get a statement you know you get the things like that it's something stated it's a detailed or explicit communication it's the act or manner of stating something so to say the kids are saying this is my statement well right now let's don't go off on them I never have you know that we had our laptop haircuts we had our duck tails we had our long higher was in some forms but you know beginning to come down and and and we were making our statements with a bell bottom pants in the thing we were doing that in the kids today basically as they're saying I'm rebelling against society right that's a statement then your world is making you know you go to to any country that you go to and you'll see that their their manner of clothes their doings or actions is making a statement about you know what they're wanting to say right in the in a statement people can communicate see with sign language in other words raise hands what does it mean Universal sign of surrender see so you're making a statement and you're saying this is what I'm trying to say the way you walk the way you act the way you do is make you a statement that's worth it you know what you say somebody's done to hire one way and then you see them change to another way you know well most of the time they're making a statement all right I used to kind of push my backhand and everything until it got to get them sitting in front like that how much stand enough to push back and and I looked at it one day and then I thought this is me so I'm just honest I'm saying cause we all do it now so you know that's a Pentecostal look cause you never see a televangelist or any of these guys with a common haircut right it's it's a swept back as long you don't do it you know what I decided what I'm going to say then cut off I'm going to change my statement it's not that I don't want to be associated with anybody it's just I look back in my old days and I thought you know the haircut I wore when I was a kid was a good statement it was the only thing we've gonna forward right so I'm started saying well I'm going to cut off my took my heart back to make it like it is now and I'm going back to a country boy you know just a statement because now you think about it everything we do our manner of life are doing is making mistakes you were certain close you sisters you wear long dresses what do you make of a statement right you're saying I believe in being not modern any but it says modest a pearl see and so your statement is that you don't cut your heart then you're making a statement oh man you mean you don't go around with a long higher you know and all of the stuff like that one because we're making a statement to people that we are not like that we are different we're ourselves they were making the same everything you do is make a mistake who you follow me now all right so then in what we're doing what is our statements today declare statements are or can be verbal or they can be just you know as I said making a statement about clothes you buy the things you do but what kind of statements are we making all right now the prophet of God said go ahead and pull it number one with Brooke Anderson look like the prophet of God see no statements or actions or doings everybody follow me every man under there that had it and something different the world knew it every woman had it had something different the world knew it the world can see it your actions prove what you are you can say you got it but your actions speak so loud that they can't hear your voice your life speaks what you are all right now so then sisters if you're wearing your long dresses and you're making a statement with it that's wonderful but what kind of a statement would you be making if you put on the skimpy dresser you know done a little bit different when you go out now that was what I got into trouble here while back trying to explain about women you know I always do I'll get into trouble with this today but I'll get it off my heart to think we make a statement what kind of a statement are you making when you come to church looking decent but then you're ashamed to run into the pastor or somebody when you're out shopping now what kind of a statement anybody what do you say what's the point what are you saying let's see then we wonder why our children don't want the message when they can read our statements a whole lot better than we think you know what kind of statement is being made the brothers we you know we're Church we we talk good we are good and we do but then out on the world out there and people whether they're you know where we work around what kind of statement is our life a minute would it be a statement worthy of the gospel would it be you know something to win people to the message or would it be that they can look at our actions and they can't hear a testimony who hit with number two then their testimonies are killed by her actions what about it I'm just asking the question because it's time to give a nod and settle down and answer a lot of questions and to find that where we stand and what's going on - look what your prophets they we're are known by the life that we live it's been said you're alive sleep so loud I can't hear you testimony so therefore deliver a sermon with much better than to preach one the life you may have shows what character you are because your life always builds your character jesus said no one see my the fruits use your roving don't no matter what we would say or how much we would testify different lies doesn't coincide coincide with that testimony we are doing the kingdom of God an indefinite by giving that testimony because people know what we are so you say today brother you'll say today and I'm sure it's already hit some of your minds you say brother Dale is going to pick on me today you're exactly right okay okay brother dick brother mark brothers here let me nightmare my back through our local congregation I'm gonna pick on you today this is my day for coming back off a vacation the longest I ever went without preaching services since I've been preaching right so you know but now this our lives are so grateful people can't hear a testimony what is the testimony of your neighbor had none you see we're only deal with oh they think we're crazy bunch of nuts we believe a profit we did but what do they see you know they see us more than we think and you know they're looking a whole lot more than they're looking to find something to have an excuse for not accepting what you're saying right so they're watching what we do no no I can profit sit there then our lives is what bills are Ted per character he did say our testimony you know of our two means and all he said our lives that we live builds our character to a position so what does he language talk about you well I'll give it what they think well okay you're the one I'm talking about that's got to be the devil about God talking so that's who I'm talking about all right because the Prophet said we'd do in Determan you know we damage our testimonies about the kingdom the Lord saved me will say oh oh that's so wonderful I just see they make so wonderful in my heart and the neighbor sees you sisters with it just a little bit of makeup you know just a little doing this and a little doing that you cease your actions and reactions around people No seize the clothes you were the shoes you were you know what statement are we making we feel awful in the kids we go off on all of that you know and we see somebody or a group of people you know there's a group damage around Commerce there that are basically black people I don't know call the number after probably like Muslim I'm not certain I don't know it's nothing to me but you see them with their hiring or doings or caps on their long gowns and things like that well you know I wonder are we that we Americans we want to free these countries and you know yourself that the way I talk about it is we wanted to go to Afghanistan or somewhere and free those women well did we free them they would have had like Americans you know marrying wear long dresses even veiled over their face that I wouldn't say you had to wear that but what's the opposite side of it yeah because I've always been this way even if the women did Bank your face you have a veil over nobody could see done right but I've always been one thing I'm just honest now truthfully trying to me if I've ever going to want to dress rather won't dress right in church and do right at Churchill right well if your sisters if you can't if you've got to do this or you got to do that you got to punch your face a little you got to do these things at least you can do it while you're out in the world let them see you're just lost if I always tell the people around here don't go to some of these meetings and things and tell them where you go to church at cause I said you know this brother they don't let that go on can he see that those women make your face and and cut their hair a little bit it's tradition to this no no no no we just got the daddy and we just well what about it what kind of a statement are we trying to make what's our lives stating to the world that we believe oh yes we're quick to say we believe the Prophet if you heard the problem what what is the thing that you going here and there and things that see if it used to be another daddy but it is now the first thing you do you just type in and you type in we can Brandon well what do you get I mean do you get that so many people who are raising the dead you can get it that deep healing campaign that went to the world and so many millions were healed in' in an Africa alone that there was like 30,000 coins Hertz and one service or something like that is that what you get what do you get you get all the bad puns right why because they're making a statement right the people who put that on there are making a statement no this is like that gods general it's the first one that we were able to get a hold of it even mention run around without of that whole book that was dark of all of the great you know evangelists and and all like that run around was the only one that they attacked about his dogs they get the book read legal and let you have it he was the only one see George Soros get out in order to if I was reading the book you know what I'd say then one thing to read what this guy said is because everybody's against you but that's not the way people do right what kind of statement are they making I'll kind of a statement are we making what are our last display maybe that's the reason our children some of them don't want to mess it maybe that's the reason they don't believe it well because they don't see you they see you and I but they see us in the faith because they see us that a time that maybe you know we get upset we get this we get that when I said one that's no different nobody else see what is our statement you believe that around his property my brother just not too long ago back he made a statement one time and he said that's no different any other Church Willie's holy prophets makes it then that's just another denomination right you know liking words I'm sure but all right but you see one day I had an opportunity to just express my this message look this this message was not an argument the fuss and rocking up complaining and clothes wearing and miss that nilly but it was a revelation of Jesus Christ simply to show us Christ then to see Christ Minnie and the people we you know that one the person who did the macy's a lot more than the arguments I couldn't put forward the quoting of the scriptures Oh wonderful but what are people watching how do we leave them how do we that's gonna be blood people have athletes that pray for me pray for my family you'll come to church we pray they come to church and what happens to the people that was praying come on they start leasing I like it a little your NY life see we'll cover that too maybe this afternoon baptism but you know that what we confess and what is going to be the Bible doesn't say Q to confess your sin it says to confess you're here with metaphor say but we're not supposed to confess receipt you want to say confess it's not wrong to say I don't feel good I'm sick that's right because we are human being but when we just lay on that and build on that and every time we don't feel good but I wonder if you were called men women whatever who do you say one thing you see everybody knows things you're talking about the isn't undone I'm just know about all of us so forget it but sisters are you know brothers if you were called on this evening to direct the services I said direct that way you would be preaching and you got violently sick before you came what would you do then you'd get better without service money could you call it your duty or what if somebody invited you to come to a special event would you ever be sick enough to not go ahead of them or would you go when you see if a ballgame is you want to see your favorite team is anything getting your way to keep you from going now you'll pack the fields in and you'll get everything in the world on you see what kind of actions never they don't like me yes okay come too much you that's all that would you say I try not to talk about one person I try to talk from the pulpit they were one of us what are we doing what are we displayed to the world words our actions and reactions do look at the necklace number three remember at 149 flashing red lights the sound of his tongue do you know one of them about it you know what they say and so what you to say no oh Bob what is gonna stand in my way I'm having some fun now no Obama was gonna tell me I can't trim a little bit in my heart the word just a little bit might good will come a statement we might not never said that you could see on you punch you punch that's what you're saying come on wake up right what a man no Obama don't stand in my way of having some fun no wonder one that our kids sometimes act like us right is it true you know they they dress our waist if I needs a lot done these are called wear dresses their buddies to try to win them come on sister you ain't foolin nobody brothers waiting fooling nobody forget they know buddy snowball now all of our good beautiful actions we talk about they're watching our reactions behind us and we claim to believe everything about things not just exactly you tell them it's written in the Bible though they might not say those words but that's what they express did you ever hear you don't say an action speaks louder than words well then does it actions speak louder than words no matter what you're saying you your life speaks aloud till they can't hear your testimony as I said this morning just jump as high as you live yeah your action speaks louder than your words and you just might as well come out and say it because their own words speed you your words no matter what it is your actions speak what's your honor yes if you speak anything different from what you really are what is he saying it becomes hypocrisy Jesus said you never Chris how do you say good things when out of the heart speak and out of the heart speak with the mouth see they were saying something they didn't mean and women so it is to say oh my have my own fun what about it bro they'll have you to understand I live the Bible to the letter well let's get off the letter give the love in their hearts leading it to the letter is one thing those Pharisees live it to the letter right but what did Jesus call Democratic never natively he could look down into him because nobody else to call them hypocrites right let me come up there nobody else in walk up call Mill Creek that's lie to me when Jesus said to that you mean you know that time when the woman was there before but said he didn't without sin cast the first stone see he brought out into the inside of them into the open the little things they had secretly hidden run in one bottle when they walked away you were not fooling nobody with our sight no alright see our children are watching every move we might and what have they seen luenell get you drunk no they'll tell on me right you just tell one of them kids you don't like what brother Dale said and they'll come around say you know I don't know why I'm with my mom or my dad you said didn't mind what you say remember the see Byron and 42 children they wouldn't say go up will ball head ain't even know anything about this kid ain't know anything about going up for anything they were hearing mom and daddy sitting around the table that little feller sitting on the floor you better be careful he's coming up the road the other day and we kept trying to figure out what how long it's been you remember the last Christmas program we had was that Ben it wasn't this year that would be year before so it had to be on back right happy shaking her head she knows I'm on top of my her she couldn't have been over two years old right she would have been from the Christmas up to that maybe two and a half you know what she said did you remember when white had that fighting on you know that got over his face and and had that gal home and he was doing that in that play with me and put on its a jerk and said remember how I was dressed up like a horse and said no I hope I get said JK was dressed up like a cow and Zoey was dressed up like a pig he said what are you getting that but two-and-a-half-year-old describe it what happened how can you remember what that's fine but you wish you remember that if she described in detail the looks and the things it was taking money do you think they're not watching you think they're not seeing the actions look the next paragraph 51 a prisoner of 63 still in play as I just expressed if your life will prove and once if your life will prove your life will prove exactly what size your own I don't care what size you say your own what you do every day prove what you are you've heard the old saying your life is so loud I can't hear you testimony see your accent it's the lab I've always believed in shouting and jumping but I always say don't jump little higher than you live because of the world is going to watch that the you must just jump as high as you Liam no because everybody is watching you everybody's watching their watch interactions or reactions are doing we say we love God we love these word but why is the people of this makes you get all upset when somebody can quote brother branham's messy is it that they don't read it study the microphone brother the other day I said you know big ones call me than anybody unless is my lord after studying this maxi's over 40 years we already know a little bit about what I'm gonna run say yeah right I mean if that's how you study then you studied everybody else that's theories but if you studied the message then what is it just remember we're not fooling somebody we get up here we play which saying we worship with challeng for a little bit no but we and what you were looking at you know that I've had a visiting preacher ask me what's wrong with some of you now do you like place they never ate in the center looking like this sad or mad how would you like to answer this thing maybe order do you like it don't do two brothers went down there they don't film in the COFA little brother away from here to get him offered totally go to motel a couple of brothers got home till they said why don't why didn't you take him on a week and snow it'd be quite a manly man left I said that man had just been in the brothers house that seemed over here to get rid of him for over 30 days the next time you pull one of them deals in front of me with somebody up I'll send them home with you we don't want that no problem but you see our actions reacting how'd you like to talk to preachers let's say and they said you wanted six and once it when it sleeps woman what do we display I'm actually having to say don't they believe must be in preach I said I don't know because their actions and reactions never tell me whether they are actions react something you never give an IV in no matter what what's your act you know to sit there stone-faced and there amen you're saving something wrong what the preachers say now you tell me how I'm going tell you yes that I'm Toki here if you come my office on tape same thing I don't know what some of you believe because I can't determine by your facial expression and your actions and react you're making a statement you dress a certain way you walk a certain way you act a certain way you make a mistake no brothers come in the breach you ain't mean you accept a minute I never even need to hurt somebody gave me an arrow okay because you didn't listen to all of the been saying what about what our actions displayed what is it that we're trying to get the people to see you realize you're actually saying this is what I believe Jesus would do my say I had these notes and pains a long time so not like a proverb that I don't do it like it I wake on this type of missions until it becomes a burden on me as an actually delivers can I admit about the time that I deliver strongly Hummer I admit it'll be like other preachers it just bring in certain things at certain things you know the new messages I just never had been built in web sorry but then I get a message that bears on me then I deliver it then I have to live with what I deliver whatever action children you know that it would be a shame and a disgrace for them to ask me to run for president in the United States what have you made me in that statement but what would have happened if you have asked see folks I get letters from a lot of places denominational place Gainesville area everything they have I get a notice you know I'm talking about religious events let's enter into gatherings of the Brethren to do in the dead I don't never go there well you want to go try to have them if you that far gone that's problem every time that Kingdom takes most of you know what it is when the biggest suppliers in the country of religious material etcetera you know that they call me all the time and in fact me to come the meetings that they're having in the state of Georgia but you know I'd be hypocrite no cousin wouldn't now more Dumbledore go come on you see I don't want to be a hypocrite and go shut down and make fun of them and a lot of them I wouldn't do it for nothing in the world but what would you do I'm invited to go anywhere just almost in the world overseas especially to preach in this message but you see I realize and know that that's not gonna work but I'm not made that way brother said to me just the other day he said you don't go very many places and preach to the announcer to preach at your church as much as your and appreciating work which meant one time jeno I make a statement I make a statement of a Harvard Stern strict belief in the prophets mission and believing it must be revealed to us not just talked about but must be lived and they don't like it they want to know what your input is than the words you ask somebody what is their input isn't a lot of times it means that you you don't know where you're at don't ask me what the input isn't actually what the prophet sav the maximum wants my idea of what the Prophet said asked me what he said it's weren't given trouble see I would say well this is what he saved I was in a meeting one time with some ministers trying to explain something and I even read we're running around said this is thus saith the Lord you know in just a few minutes there was Isis notes each other trying to contradict what I say I didn't say the profits in sign statements what do we do what does it study with me you by looking everybody looking what does this mean I mean I teach them to you I might know you set up statements where are our statements displayed everything we do is making a statement the people around them they have a beginner another than guilt from everyday and my brothers to exert I go out and watch someone get us some biscuits analyzing their after every day talk about politics at night I told you what they ask me other days did you vote for Obama - ain't voted since Kennedy they just all like mine voted for President Alexis's Kennedy that was my

and we've got to come here together and sit together than in other places don't stay home if God is in your heart you can hardly wait for the door to open that younger beginning here associate with you brothers if you don't know feel that way then I tell you it's time you're not afraid but how many of you they get the heart what do you say when you come one service and don't come another you're telling the congregation you don't need one since we have arrived now you tell me I'm in my office so then tell me on the liar I'll tell you right up front I'm not you see your pastor don't do like all these others no doubt and expectations a new hobby thing we go to church when we don't honey the only time I've missed this year is the one in Alabama and we didn't have another way of getting wins tonight and if we could have done it and had to leave on Tuesday we have to use not services till Wednesday when we do that we to him talk about the Lord don't tell me my statement is if you don't have to listen but you didn't read what the Prophet said he said if God is in your heart come in my statement is I'm questioning whether God's in your heart or not okay we fall back to that with number other day let's see don't use that as a crutch please don't you get in trouble with God you know that what I've always said you say I'm not going kind of sick because it's time for the service to start here you'll get better but you know to than what I've said is right the devil will come down and laugh at you and say see you're better now you went to church he's been all right he ain't gonna let up because if he don't let up I'll hit you I like the statement see we proved our actions and reaction what we are hello back to what I said well ago but if you were calling to sleep this afternoon would you let any sickness get in your way what if you sisters were called to go visit Obama at the White House well we won't go that far to go they stated you are the president of your company did you work for see we like to say Amen when we talk about her and dress and clothes and money but what about our attendance at church 20 years ago some of you would miss church from that men world because you talk to where it was coming and now what's your state I crossed over to close a good number six look what he did it mrs. adoption 1960 when the Prophet said neither were the church is thinner today on that walk you know that your own behavior cannot pin somebody you know I hope getting healed your misbehavior won't confess sins of your with you believers and cause this church to bitterly flannel but never know that I can't have though I like what brother Gerald useless preaching you say Maggie hallow sins of unbelief I'm a Christian I like the way brother you've run it out on Saturday night Christians do have problems remember Christians you know morning that stands boomer old remember those things do you misbehavior run to have send a new believers you say somebody come in here and disrupt the services some unbeliever well then I wanted light unbelievers is not what he told them you talk about believers because they start to barely fail we will say that but then we really believe the next statement and that the day of judgment you'll be responsible for every bit of it no you say now wait a minute brother branham well that's the truth think of it now here's what we think we think even if I have done something and I do cross a problem I've asked God to forgive me you wouldn't God you sit in the hands if you hinder anybody in this congregation from being healed this congregation is who you've got to talk to not God come on you won't run around you won't say the rest of the day you know it woman Glavine commits adultery who does she have to go to god no she goes to her husband first then she can go to God because it does are no good to go to God come on my actions and reactions yeah and like I said while ago people around you or looking they know who ain't Manson then know who don't and I know why you're a man and why you don't I Amen what I believe come on sisters brother I ain't never said he'd like Rome sister Johnny asked me that years ago what about women saying Amen I said we have very few that does but I'm very wasn't saying my body what about our actions and reactions any kind of special event think we have around here some of you won't come you're making the statement I like to wait there I said it about the election so what I've noticed there's a lot of you miss when the elections for pastor come we don't have to have an election for passenger according to the Prophet according to the state of Georgia and the rules we regulate under we must smoke some of you've never voted in the president whether or not I'm to be your fasting that come will not like my carrots is the no vote our not voting is a no vote and you get that right not voting is a no vote so no no no well tariffs is the only one when I stood up here and was going what was we going through that time we were talking about building on out here and doing it over that way and fixing it he's the only one who got the building that said I don't agree with you he let it be known he didn't agree with me I never had no problem you know what we didn't do that we wouldn't count him another thing happened with lease he stated his statement he made each day but I don't agree with with my meeting over to hit every day on the foofy about it you don't notice me sometimes folks I'll spend right here on two or three different occasions and made this statement let's see if you'll remember it I'd be right in the middle of the sermon that stop and say I forgive you what do you think I'm talking about I'm forgiving you because of your studying that you're right we have a lot of advance money will come one brother one time said like this don't make me no more spiritual cover don't go no we don't make you no more spiritual coffee if you want but does it make you more spiritual or not don't need you go somewheres out come on does that make you more spiritual cross she went somewhere else because he didn't down know what up some of you have made it plain that you did not agree with those ship meetings that we have teens and participating I've never said a word about that anything wrong we the only major state there's a pastor of this church we agree with fellowship but a lot of you tonight above if you didn't agree with it you might have to help you might have done them in here but they're the only thing question I ask you this is making more stir for if you don't come to throw at me where you go out to some worthy event what we're having stir we're having to focus me come on the day big line the Prophet said you'll cause the church to bitterly fight [Music] we're feel strong with a real strong about tonight coming up here to be prayed for we don't want the kids running around man reactions and actions back in the back and do it on brain go to the hindrance but what about the starfish attitudes most of the time what is that's much kinder this year now as I get to that while ago I hope you caught it if you do wrong you gotta come to the church and that's the church forgive you can't go to God and ask him to forgive you so then the prophets right now why would he make that statement he's at Ana the day of judgment you have to give an account I thought we believe we're going into rapture there's nothing to get slammed born in a rapture does that change what he said what about it though they've been ridiculing a lot by the way he does things in this church and I don't have to answer you don't have to I'm a fan I'll have to give an account for those signs but when I try it's not making a statement today let's don't talk about the rapture here we get where we can live so you can all make intersection of American Fisher's so what's our confession our confession to their statements I come here every Sunday in priests and I felt like a statement to you about what I believe the Bible is means and I give you the reason I make those statements because this woman just got to do with that on the doctrines reason I don't believe them be ready to give an answer the reason I hope realizing it you ready to give a statement that's when we don't have a lot of trouble with people coming in here bringing in those they already know our statements but now you're gonna hold on to this one doctrine is not going to put us in the rapture hold your wording revealed word will put us in the rapture not a doctrine a doctrine is not a revealed word revealed word is a live Christ that will put us in the rapture when I first thing I asked the last have we handed our by our actions and reactions have we hindered someone else we Bend a lot of fellowship meetings and pains one time I mean but somebody said he'll never work well the next statement they made was outlandishly wrong you know see I didn't know this put them together I was a Amen in the statement prior you know in other words we'd say like you know I believe in one crude living God and I'd say Amen but it's really God in three persons now I didn't even agree with that name I agreed with the statement you know some of the people asked me coming home at night I said well you ain't me and what that brother say well you know what I found out then you ever go to church and the preachers are preaching the pastor said my word that's why I get over here you know we're best men dude hi but you notice people the preachers preaching uncle Amy my cousin the checking it out with the pastor the if he's a man is a minute I sure hope you don't get that away but I believe you do because you're looking around a lot of times wondering what brother so much older sister so and so you're having to say about what's going on say let's we make the actions we do prove the profits in what we are prove our testimonies we can talk all we want to the people know people know but we are he's going to Israel tonight Lucas in a place and done a whole lot of interrogate before they'd let us on the plane this was before 9/11 I had them been told I probably went with on the college money but he said Sam don't cut out with him customs really know now that you care we got there in the life of sin you're done first turn wrench you he's reading you knew you've read her more to read me so I said matter you should make other became you know I don't a man I said I don't either that's what I'm talking I said physically search me do anything you want to my legs ask me any question you want ask everyone if what see it now walk into a lot of places in it I didn't went one place one company the brother and I have been to this place and then our seven day had a wonderful time preaching the grounder place brother stepped up behind innovation where you've answered have been when he opens seven days to go over that away I like no I guess they can always that nut for something you know really get by but they just let's see what we are then one thing you'll never accuse this man of being as a hypocrite if I can have a piece of theater you may differ with me right my wife differs from a lot of playing to what I do in the natural so you don't say anything about what a brief but something the natural she'll be for women like everything don't think sitting there already I could tell you how much money we got in the bank if we're gonna Brown get tomato I know the real speed play ain't that big a dummy would you see people think they taking food the area sister Barbara hopes you don't mind me sayin cutter told her one day you talk about the Islamic women in a way they behave has to give women you're like any other woman I said there cannot be deceiving and they'll do anything to work with me what you want she's not a lifetime you know one bleep rookie y'all ain't gonna be our goody-goody fine just puts us in ranch but we're not going with a lot of ragtag everything okay statements what statement are you late I tell you you must don't brag about what let's go to the doctor doctor said go we take the MS we do what a doctor's name I never told nobody not to do anything like less if we leave in here we come here we're worshipping we have a good time don't like the Lord being a healer laughs I'm done well in technocracy that's a statement our lives is a display don't we try to be nice knowing we've had women come in here and hope and pray we didn't get up with a wrong distinct beat them two dead run out the door after you know after a while now you would get the message we have to give but what if the neighbor over that time I think all that's a bunch of holding this people over and then they see somebody like that they see some of your sisters walking around with high heels you'll see your short dresses and anything they don't know and they're saying brother Dale that's that goodbye no wonder they say we're not different anybody and I agree with them except for one time we've got to desire to hear God's work have been based upon faith cometh by hearing and believe in the Word of God never claimed to be holy and righteous the claim to be the Bride of Christ my brother usually don't matter what it's a to be wouldn't either one they said to people in the back of the leisure bra around see the women without Staheli that's the bride I mean just women folks that with all of us men and all have set up and I don't believe in meeting on this one I just once all of you there's a reckoning taken and we're gonna have to give an account for everything that we can't get under the blood year they con these things what kind of a statement he made what are we saying to the world what are we declaring to our families you know I'm so glad God let this go because back in the old days when we first started in the message there was a lot of people that were legalistic and screaming and hollering about things and you know after maybe 30 40 years they started doing those fun well if it was wrong being wrong now what statement we make one anyone anybody [Music] [Music] I represent save in any state with these money you want forgiveness actions and reacts father you hurt our brother Jesus Christ accessories [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] turn to the head [Music] that's just more sensation of the church publicity I support what brother Dale has preached and I believe it and if I've been a hindrance to anyone here I asked the church to forgive me and because I don't want to click Church it's serious time and like brother Branham was saying you you either for God or if you're not you're good be against the amendment let's go run know your game go I want to make my Santeria that untrue for what God says and I want to be a living example of what you say Miriam's never need [Music] well I was going to testimony they want to give them time to heal tonight before I just defined like apologize to the church if is anything that I have done I know love times I haven't set the right example when I came to testify this morning Friday was the day I have salt God for 32 years asked you know that I knew that I knew that I had only comes Friday took care of it and then get this way they already tried to shake you already proved it it ain't how many you might be trying for volatile what some of you've been doing but dr. everything is this man here anybody else is back here across this pulpit I said Lord is it me and that thing of hindering somebody else it's always booked got to turn that pride I don't know man it's just a blessing that Ohio looks pretty good if you have her you're still a little something there that you don't quite sure you might take a while you love people preach salvation is just one thing that's not I preached we believe that you go through justifications things facing baptism holyoke right are now over I believe but I believe it's a very rare occasion that that happened it takes over long period of time so don't stop seeking God and then when you do get to the place that you realize that God has answered you you surely will never stop seeking its presence just look always do that father we thank you for your grace and understanding we pray that you just bless us now is we go out a natural way to either naturally or just less they provided me with us just have your way your ordinance your life might shine in each one of our parts in life remember wages these ministering better than I for brother Spencer and just
