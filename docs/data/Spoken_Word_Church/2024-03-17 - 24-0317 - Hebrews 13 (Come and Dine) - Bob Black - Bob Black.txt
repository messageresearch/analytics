TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God bless you Saints it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word this morning Lord we just ask Lord that you'll bless the service today Lord help our hearts Lord Jesus Lord that we'll be open to receive what you have in store for us be with us today Lord as we study these things out Grant it now Lord we ask in your name so we uh we're making our way through Hebrews 13 and we're on Hebrews 13:9 uh we got a little bit past this last Sunday but I'm just going to backtrack just just briefly and just to meditate on some of these verses where Paul is saying be not carried about with diverse and strange doctrines for it is good it is a good thing that the heart be established with Grace now now think about what he's saying here the heart the heart be established with Grace not with Meats now see he's comparing the inside and the outside here not with Meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein and then you know with we we kind of looked at last time the uh last week how that and the the Hebrew rituals of the Old Testaments were to make sure that to compare the different kind of meats that you don't eat something that was offer offered to an idol don't eat this and uh separate the uh clean and the unclean food and all all that kind of thing they have got all their rituals for the meat the meats that you would eat but he's saying what what's going to help the inside what's going to help the your heart and you know you you think as you study these things out that there's there's meat for the soul and there's meat for the Flesh and you can be so concerned about the meat for the Flesh and and uh that you're trying to clean up the outside clean up uh take care of the outside thing that you're not concerned about what what's going to benefit the inside I was thinking about in John John was it John chapter 4 where Jesus was talking to the woman at the well and after he got done talking to her his disciples came up and they said Master we got some food for you master eat they had gone to get some food and he said I've got food that you don't know I've got meat that you don't know anything about and so so there we can see and of course if you go on St that out the meat the meat that he was talking about was to do the will of the father and of course his will is found in his word so you've got meat that can that can benefit your soul that can clean up your soul change your soul and meet things on the the external I think that kind of goes along with exactly what brother Andrew was preaching yesterday that there's a there's a fire of God and that can clean up the inside let's worry about the inside there's a lot of things you you get so concerned with the things on the outside that like like last time we were illustrating with Cain bringing his fruits first you bring try to try to try to satisfy God's word and so forth with the fruits with the works first and that's just not the right pattern but if you do like Abel and and try to get the soul right get the inside right then the outside will naturally take take care of itself get get the inside right and those are the things that Jesus was talking about when he preached to the Pharisees where these are things we're all familiar with what you scribes and Pharisees that you like why did supples the outside's taken care of but on the inside it's it's like a real pretty Garden all the outside's pretty there's the the grave is painted but on the inside it's full of dead men's bones and all un cleanness or like a a a cup or a platter that on the outside it's nice and clean but on the inside it's like who would want to drink out of that that's nasty full of ravness and wickedness so so again what Paul's talking about is there's meat for the inside and there's meat for the outside don't be so concerned about the outside get the inside taken care of clean the inside in Matthew chapter 15 Jesus said but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart it's the heart is the problem and they defile the man for out of the heart proceede evil thoughts murderers adulteries fornications thefts false witness blasphemies see if you try to tackle that from the outside well I'm going to not I'm I'm not going to tell a lie today I'm not going to uh do anything wrong I'm going to try to keep myself but your inside is still cankered and is still messed up then eventually eventually it's going to work itself out these are the things which defile a man Jesus said but to eat with unwashed hands defileth not a man in other words he's saying don't Focus so much on the external it's not eating something with unclean hands that will defile you but what will defile you is that rotten cankered inside that can only be fed by the meat of the word of God now that's what Paul's point is there's meat for the inside and meat for the outside L's be concerned with the meat for the inside and that's why we're all gathered here this morning as we want some meat we want some good old gospel food that'll feed our soul and change our soul in Romans Chapter 2 he said for he is not a Jew Paul's laying this out he's not a Jew which is one outwardly the outward is not the thing that makes you a good Christian or Jew or whatever neither is that circumcision which is outward In the Flesh that was the Old Testament way trying to satisfy things by The Works of the law trying to do do and keep all the Commandments but he is a Jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of God Amen now in Hebrews 13:10 Paul says this this this verse is a little bit hard to kind of wrap our minds around but let's meditate on this we've got an altar we've got an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the Tabernacle That Old Testament Tabernacle I got a picture here of they they bring their sacrifice and they lay their sacrifice up on that Altar and now the priest had the right if it was a peace offering a different kind of rule peace if it was a PE peace offering the breast is mine and the right thigh is mine and he could take that grab the hook and grab some of that food off and and that was his to eat and you could eat off of that sacrifice that was brought to the altar now so Paul's saying we've got an altar now they don't have any right to eat of this altar that we're talking about now in the Old Testament they could e eat off that Old Testament altar but now we've got a new testament altar now I I just want to change gears for a second and point out that brother brandham would always use this scripture whenever he preached his life story so let's read the scripture that he would read before he preached his life story we've got an altar where of they have no right to eat which serve the Tabernacle for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp think about why brother Brandon would use this scripture as he preached his life story that his whole message was to feed us to give us something that that we could eat of that they didn't have access to if they were looking at from a legalistic standpoint but we've got some real Eagle food that they don't have a right to eat we've got something that we we're we're going beyond the camp of man's ideas and the camp of our own ideas the denominational system we're going outside of the outside of the camp to get this food see he said for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come now I think that that's the theme of of pretty much what brother Ram's whole Ministry was about to take us beyond the camp to get some food that you couldn't eat if you're looking at it from a a legalistic step trying to satisfy the works but this food is for our soul to change our soul to build up our faith we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the Tabernacle and there's the the priest bringing us bringing the uh doing the the rights were the the sacrifice is being brought and he's got a right to take some of that some of the animal for his food to eat of the sacrifice eating is partaking and we'll just we'll just labor this just for a moment in Revelation Chapter 2 it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that I overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life amen and Proverbs chapter 9 says come eat of my bread and drink of the wine which I have mingled and Isaiah 55 says oh everyone that thirsteth Come Ye to the waters and he that ha no money Come Ye and buy and eat Y come buy M wine and milk without honey and without price so we've got an altar where of they have no right to eat what serve the Tabernacle what's the altar the altar is where the sacrifice is made and where the sacrif where our sacrifice is made is on the cross so what this means is if you continue to adhere to your that legalistic way of thinking or trying to satisfy the outside man by serving the Tabernacle you don't have access to the spiritual benefits you don't have a right to eat of this New Covenant and you can probably see where I'm going with my lesson we're eating we're eating the body word of the Flesh of the son of man we're that's the altar that we're eating at that's and when you eat from that then you've got access to these benefits you got access to these these new testament benefits that they had no access to in the Old Testament that the New Testament gives you access to these B what what kind of benefits you've got now You' got a guide to the truth You' got a comforter you've got the Holy Ghost as your teacher you got power to overcome and live a holy life you got you got when you need to go in prayer you got a helper like in Romans chapter 8 it says likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself make us intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered he he'll uh we've got somebody that'll help bear our burdens we've got a seal that seals Us in and keep seals the Holy Ghost in seals God in our soul and seals the devil out and it will produce fruit in our life and those are the benefits that come from eating off of this new testament Al altar the eating the body word of the sacrifice that died for us that they can't eat from if you're looking still looking for an Old Testament Viewpoint or a Viewpoint of Works will say it like that right so what we're really getting at is in John 6: 53 this this this this uh little sermon that Jesus gave to the ones that were still with him that so many people have pondered at and even today in the a lot of denominational viewpoints like Roman Catholicism they don't they're they're looking at this totally in a carnal way and unable to understand what Jesus was saying here but when he said verily verily I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat and deed and my blood is drinking deed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father has sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me I was thinking this morning that you know after Zach got got was received a new birth and he had that he had that dream one night where he was he was sitting in front of that buffet table and it was like you know he was being told you can just eat and eat and eat and that's what we're doing when we when you open up your Bible when you come to church you're just you you've got you've got access to this altar where you can eat of this you can eat of all these spiritual promises because we're eating of the body word of the son of man and we're eating and eating and it's changing us as you eat it changes your nature it changes the way you think it changes everything about you so that you don't even look at the world the same way again you don't look at the problem you eat from The Book of Job and you won't look at the problems in your life the same way anymore because you realize that God's in control and God's over everything and and it changes things that's what the word is it's actually it's actually changing the way that we look at things now look at Hebrews 13:1 for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp now here he's he's kind of putting a story in our mind if you want this word you got to go beyond your own think you got to go outside the camp of your ideas and outside the camp of your thinking outside the camp of maybe what the norm is of religion and and all the denominational ideas you got to step outside of that camp to go get this food for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach oh isn't it worth it's worth all the approach all the mocking to go with him to follow that sacrifice outside the camp cuz that's where he was he he died was outside of the city Gates and and and we've got this this scripture in Leviticus that that kind of talks about how the the sacrifice was the bullet for the sin offering it was it was they took it and they took it outside of the camp to burn it to burn the fire the skins and the Flesh and so forth just like how Jesus was taken outside of the city Gates you can see the map there of the city of Jerusalem it's really hard to see there but there in the upper left is where gol gotha was so they took him um down the streets and mocking him and making fun of him all through the City till they got outside of the gate and that's where they put him up on the on the cross and laughed at him and mocked him and that's the same way with your ex your Christian experience you got to go outside of the camp and brother Ram said in going beyond the camp he said let us go beyond the camp now let us go beyond our own thinking Amen Let Us Go by the thinking of God yes and the Bible said this let the mind that was in Christ be in you so let us think his thoughts not our own thinking because most of the time we're wrong so to be sure let his mind rest in us and his mind was to do the father's will and the father's will is his promised word I just got a couple of circles here that shows the nor the big the big camp but to go outside of that camp where the sacrifice is typified by this little cross there and you're going outside of that outside of the the the way that that you think and everybody else thinks outside of that and going beyond the camp brother R said I know there is some reason that people are not getting through to Christ if they would they wouldn't act like that so what he's saying is that if we get the inside Changed by going being willing to go outside of the camp and get that spiritual food off that altar that we've got access to that will change us and sanctify us and clean us up he said Jesus suffered without the gates that he might sanctify his people with his own blood sanctification comes from a Greek word compound which means clean and set aside for service and when God cleans his people with the blood of Jesus he cleans them from the filth of the world and sets them aside for service aren't you glad for a promise like that this morning that God can clean you up and make you live a real Christian Life scour you up with a baptism of Fire by the Holy Ghost and clean you up so you can live a holy life and that's what that's what going outside the gates does to follow Christ and going out beyond the camp he said let us go beyond the camp tonight Lord and find you I've got a picture here just of like a man leaving a denominational Church like uh you know he he brother R will explain that Exodus is going out leaving going out and then going into But first you got to you got to go beyond the camp you got to leave you got to leave those old ideas and so forth amen and you know if you really think what happened when that in that Exodus when the when the children of Israel left first they escaped the Tyrant of pharaoh and all of his oppression but then they come then they come to the to the uh to the Mount sini where Moses went up to bring the tables of stone down to deliver them from themselves if we go from go beyond the camp from of all that denominational system and the way that people think but if we then keep going beyond the camp to be delivered from your own will and from your own ideas and that's what this message does it changes Chang is everything we'll never find him by joining the church we'll never find him by shaking hands with some minister or signing some Creed or something that we promise all of those things are external to go to Sunday school so many days out of the year and so forth we'll only find him in the word because he is the word sir and as we see this day promised that he would be outside the camp put out again now let us go beyond the camp ready to bear his reproach hated of this world but loved of the one who has invited us to the camp there's another quote where brother R said if there be those here who doesn't know him and has never went beyond the camp of some church affiliation yet you profess to be a Christian but when you say these things I believe as for another day that shows it cannot be the Holy Spirit how can a man that's filled with the holy ghost ever be baptized using the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost when Paul the great Apostle said if an angel comes from Heaven you might have done it one time not knowing any different those people did it not knowing different in Acts 19 but said an angel preaches anything different Let It Be A cursed how can you accept some Creed or some ISM some something another when the Bible said the promise is unto you the same thing the real baptism of the Holy Spirit how can the holy spirit that wrote the word be in you denying the word how can it deny when the very Holy Spirit itself said if any person shall add one word to this or or take anything from it I'll take his part out of The Book of Life how can the Holy Spirit then take anything from the word or add anything to the word we got to go beyond the camp to find Jesus to get to that word that will change our heart amen it seems today brother I'm said to be a day of when people are going beyond the camp and everything they're going Beyond you know I was told some time ago that they had a jet plane now that can makes them noises we hear around here that shakes the windows it's when the plane has got so fast that it crosses its own sound called sound barrier and when it goes beyond its own sound barrier it's almost unlimited to what it'll do now see what he's he's kind of getting our our mind framed up if we go beyond the way that we think and the way all the world religious system we start breaking into breaking past that unbelief barrier breaking into a world where a ring where anything is possible anything is possible breaking past breaking and what what oh he said I think in there that we get a lesson when we go beyond our own sound barrier into the word of God then it's unlimited what God can do with a man that's ready to go beyond the camp the camp of man that it is and I you can see what what kind of what I'm illustrating here as you we're we're going past all all of these things that that we're going going into a realm that will change our bodies change the molecular structure of our bodies change the way that we think you you know brother BR when and I'm going to close on this when the message persevering he talked about that those angels that that appeared and and and uh just before the seals were revealed and that the one of them that he said the one on the right had its wings turned back and if you really look at as an aircraft approaches the speed of sound it sweeping the wings back actually helps to lay the formation of shock wave so that it can break past that sound bar barrier and that he's tying that with going beyond the camp and brother R said him going beyond the camp he said so notice he rebuked them and they put him out of their Camp Jesus suffered without the camp they put him out of the camp outside Way Beyond their camp we find out that the Bible said in this last day under this lotsy and age they would do the same thing they would be put out of the camp and there You' got the picture of the son of man the word that we have that we're eating of the body word outside of the door knocking on the door cuz he's been put out of the church behold I stand at the door and knocked If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sub with him and he with with me and there's that analogy again of eating if you'll just open up the door of your heart he'll come in and you can eat with the word eat with Christ and we'll just stop there God bless you Saints
