prayers for us over the past weekend uh we we really had a good time and uh I didn't I didn't uh Minister down there but I was there in helping interpret um for the brother that uh Lord willing will have this Sunday Lord willing brother Dell uh brother Fabian um Palma now uh just real quick brother faan he is considered if you all know the La Fontaine family who's written many songs in the message that we still sing and we sing from here from the pulpit um he is considered like the La Fontaine the equivalent of the La Fontaine for Central and South America and Spain many Spanish speaking he uh he goes to he's also an evangelist and he goes to the church where brother ner is from if you remember brother ner and his family that came here a few months ago uh that's the church where they're at so brother ner has some things that he left behind before they left and they've been sitting in my basement for all these months so they had they were planning on a trip to go to London because brother Fabian was going to minister there in London England back in March or April of this year but when all this pandemic hit and everything all that was cancelled so the airlines told them that they could use those those flight those tickets for a later flight so then they decided to come this way and uh they started there in Jacksonville and brother ner followed along with him so hopefully he might be taking some of those things back with him this on this trip he can't take it all he said I'll just take what I can and the rest of it just give it to Goodwill but it'll be good to he was there this past week so it was really good to see him and he'll be here with us on Sunday Lord willing so you remember uh those uh those the meeting and uh remember those Brothers in prayer praise the Lord Jesus you love the Lord tonight amen amen amen so let's just go to the word this this evening uh we want to turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 15 1 Corinthians chapter 15 starting at verse 50 I'm just going to read it from from here I didn't have it 1 Corinthians 15: 50 I want to just do a little maybe like a little Sunday school lesson we haven't had Sunday School in a while so maybe we'll just do like a little Sunday school lesson and uh it's just something that I've been thinking about lately and I think that every Christian in this hour I think if they really have Christ in their heart this is something that should be motivating them at this very moment uh the the change of our bodies and the resurrection that we are looking forward to to seeing uh I I don't I don't I don't have any hopes for anything else in this hour but that you know the world fails you the the the politics fail you I mean this world is corrupt this country is is definitely corrupt and and uh and you can you can only and I believe God is allowing that so that we can start depending more on this word and start and start and start seeing that we can't depend on the on on the politics of this world we can't depend on any man we can't depend on any any movement any party we can only depend on God because God's the only one that cannot fail his word never failed they will never fail and so uh so we're just looking at this here and I want to talk about death where is thy sting grave where is thy Victory so we read in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 Paul says in verse 50 let me turn there myself he says now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither does corruption inherit incorruption behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed what a promise in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump in other words at the last trumpet for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed you see how Paul in each one of these verses he is saying it will be it shall be it's all positive it's there's no doubt about it for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that it is written death is swallowed up in Victory oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory and that's where I got the title for this little message The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord amen let's just bow our heads our gracious Lord Jesus we thank you Father God as we open back the pages of your word this very moment Lord we would ask you father God that you would just reveal this portion to our hearts Lord many times we've probably read many times through over these same verses throughout our years of Christianity but never stopped and pay attention and maybe delved a little deep in these scriptures and so Lord help us father God as we Endeavor to do that at this moment and we pray that you would just Reveal Your word unto us Lord make it so real to us father God that it was just drown out everything else around us father God and all and just only Look to You Lord God grant it father God we pray that you'd heal every sick one amongst us father meet every need Lord that's in our midst father God for we're certainly needy people but you are the one father God that can supply all of our needs according to your riches and Glory we love you we commit ourselves into your hands bless those that are traveling brother Wade if he's out right now traveling keep him safe father God and bless him and we just Commit This Time into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you Saints you may be seated thank thank brother Dell for giving us the opportunity to uh letting us borrow the pulpit again amen appreciate appreciate the Lord amen so death where is thy sting grave where is thy Victory amen what two questions that Paul asks here and uh uh and it's it's um it's a Sur I mean it's not that he knew he knew where where where those things were at I mean he knew the answer for them uh because he had experienced it himself in his life amen and you know we live in a culture nowadays where is it's it's full of death you know it's death all around us and it seems like everybody is is just it's in love with the culture of death uh you see it in the way they live and the way they talk and the way they dress and the way they they they they carry themselves it's a culture of death all around us amen and it's and remember that death has to be on the scene uh in order for the light to shine for the light to be able to uh it's it's it's a thing of of U uh if there's no Darkness there can't the light can't can't shine amen so we live in that type of uh situation in this hour and the thing is getting darker and darker and dark darker by the minute Saints um but the bride amen is getting brighter and brighter and brighter and it should she should be she should be getting brighter it should be getting lighter and lighter by the hour amen because every day that goes forth amen we should be letting go of all the weights and the sins that do so easily beset us as the word says amen you shouldn't be piling on more sin on your life and think that you're going to get the glory and think that you're going in a Rapture think that you're going to get a body change it doesn't work that way you need to be getting lighter and lighter and lighter as the days go by especially as we see that the days that that that that that are on us you know reading in Matthew 24 do you realize that within the past month or two a lot of things that Matthew 24 says have come to pass right I'm just in the past month or two we've had earthquakes we've had we've had wars and rumors of wars oh yeah right now China is on a verge of having a war with Taiwan going in there and invading it uh and there's Wars taking place in uh uh near Syria and and and and and conflicts and uh uh you have um I see there's Wars rumors of wars there's a pestilences of course we see the pestilence amongst us uh uh you know and so you know what what is left amen what is left for us to to to to to to experience I mean we see Matthew 24 just taking place now we've seen it throughout the years we've seen it throughout throughout the ages but I mean this is definitely it's like it's like it's gone on the increase amen it's like it's like the volume amen or the knob has been turned Amen to to a higher level you see and it's getting hotter and harder and hotter amen but the but you and I Saints amen we see these things and they should be signs to us amen for us to get in the place where we need to be Amen to look at the sign and see okay that's not not to just see the signs and be so involved and so in love with the signs but be in love with what the sign is pointing to amen which is Christ amen the and his coming praise God Amen so in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 here in the verse verse and we'll just kind of take it down verse by verse verse but Paul says here in the first in verse 50 now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God Amen neither does corruption inherit incorruption now we know that Paul says in in 1 Corinthians chapter 2:14 that the natural man cannot even understand the things of God you when you were born in this world you had no desire to serve God you don't need even understand about God that's how each and every one of us was right that's that is that is that is what we we didn't we we again we always say this and it's the truth we were never looking for God but God was always looking for us amen it's not that he didn't know where we were he knew where we were cuz he knew where Adam was when even though he was saying Adam Where Art Thou but he we know that he wanted Adam to know where in in what spot where he he was in at the moment but Paul says in 1 Corinthians chap 2:14 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him that's why when you talk to someone about God and or or or for the first time they think it's strange they think it's it's it's it's weird they think what why do I need to get born again what does that have to do with me I've never stolen I've never killed anybody I've never cheated I've never done this that or the other but they don't understand that they've come with a nature you can be as good as you as you but you come with a sinful nature that you are prone to any one of those things since God is not in in your soul amen and that is what Paul is talking about here that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God Amen and the blood is the life of the of this animal flesh that we have amen that we walk in that we we we live by the by the by flowing blood that we have in US amen but the bride of Christ the the Christian lives by the holy spirit in their soul amen God's holy spirit in their soul that's how the soul lives amen so the the spirit of God is is the life of the Soul amen that's that's in us and and that is why Jesus said in in in John 3:6 that that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Amen in other words when you when you're not a Christian you're not a Christian exactly amen when you're but when you're a Christian you should be a real Christian amen there's no in between that which is of the flesh is of the flesh that is what of the spirit is of the spirit amen God doesn't accept anything in between and there's no inet you're either hot or you're either cold amen but you can't be in between you can't be one foot in church and one foot out in the world you've got to be in on on fire for God or you've just got to be out in the world period amen serving the world serving this world order doing the things of the world Amen praise God Amen so that's what Jesus told us amen so Paul there is telling us amen that flesh and blood cannot just automatically transition into into a change right without there being a change first in your soul right you see what I'm saying let me say that again you your body body cannot transition into a body change without first there being a change inside of you in other words a touch of the Eternal within you that's right Amen in other words the kingdom of God must be in you first Glory before you can possess this Kingdom amen this Earth You see it's got to be in you first so that that's what Paul's saying there in in verse 50 neither do corruption inherit incorruption you can't say you got you're going to go to heaven in your in your natural way in your natural man and you know we all know these things but the world is so fooled in this hour that they think that if they just go to church that that's all they need oh yeah that if they just shook the pastor's hand or if they did something you know some good work and they give uh uh to Goodwill every single week or something like that that that that that'll just get them right on right in and it and it doesn't it has to be an experience with Christ it has to be something amen that is real to you amen that you know that you've been born again praise God verse 51 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed amen praise God now in um in the previous verse there Paul was talking for himself because he says now this I say but but now here is a here's a mystery introduced amen and uh you know when when we were just now talking about Matthew 24 Jesus talking to his disciples about the things that was come coming to pass we know that those had dual meanings there were some things that were going to take place in in Israel and they happened in ad70 but then you bring them down to this hour as well and to this our day but when Jesus was telling them these things they had no idea what Jesus was talking about there was a mystery to them it was a mystery to them and and it was a a mysterious thing to the disciples but now Paul here is in this case he's introducing to us another layer of these Mysteries amen praise God because he says behold I show you a mystery now if it was a mystery amen it had to been revealed to him somewhere or another praise God because he was looking forward to it he he he believed it so much and he he he wrote about it and believed it so much he thought it would happen in his day amen but we know that that's for us amen we know that we're the ones to carry out this and you should be happy and and and glad in this hour that God has had has so much confidence in you to put you in this in this generation in this in this day that we're living in Amen in order to fulfill this scripture can you imagine that in order for you to fulfill the scripture God couldn't have put the confidence on anybody else right God placed confidence in you and I who you and I with the Holy Spirit and we're the the recipients and the possible ones to to to uh to fulfill this word in this hour what a great thing Amen to think about Sir that we we I mean I don't think this thing can go on any further I mean much longer much longer I mean so why are we Dilly dallying around and playing games why are we not why are we uh holding off you know uh talking to that brother or that sister that you know you need to ask forgiveness for for something that happened several years ago and it's still bothering you you know you need to make that right so go ahead and make it right why are you why are you just you know delaying that's you playing games and that's you not taking the word seriously oh I'm coming down home now a little bit but do you realize that these are the things that that the the world events that are taking place the signs that are taking place are making us look at ourselves in our lives and seeing wait a second this is really an individual walk between me and Christ right I'm not going on mom on mom on what Mom believes or on what my dad believes or on what brother Dale believes I'm going on with what I what God has showed me amen and is it revealed to me and then I'm going to act upon it amen this thing's about over Saints praise God right amen so here Paul is introducing to us a mystery that can only come out of the mystery and who is the mystery amen what is Christ is Christ The Mystery of God revealed in US amen praise God Colossians 1:27 says to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glor GL it's something that the world has no idea that's happening right now in this hour everybody's so fixated on what's going on that they don't realize that God has a people Amen in this hour that are going to be translated and and that and that have God themselves in their souls amen sir God right now standing on this earth and the people don't realize it in this hour that's right in you and I in this hour praise God amen amen God would make known what is the riches of Glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory amen now in order for you for you to be able to come to this you have to have Christ in you the hope of glory amen it because Paul continue saying we shall not all sleep in other words we shall not all physically die amen that's kind of it's a strange thing because we're so used to seeing somebody born and then live living and then dying somebody born living and dying it's it's a it's a routine that we have seen throughout all of our lives but there will come a point in time where somebody's going to stop death at its tracks amen somebody's gonna brother Bram said that it's going to start crawling up on you and then you're just going to shr it up because you're so you're so you're so concentrated on the word on what he said and on that life amen that death won't even have anything on you amen praise God hallelujah and we need to start practicing it amen I'm not worrying about what's going on right now out here amen not worrying about what the news says not worrying about what the media says not worrying about what this person says or that person says or what believe the sign says or this that or the other amen when you look at the word and the word only amen it'll bring you to a point where you're going to be able to say death I'm not even paying attention to you you're so concentrated on God you're so concentrated on the word amen and that word amen is so in you that it's going to cause you Amen to step into that body change Amen to step into the next phase that we're that that that that is upon us which is a resurrection and Paul talks about it here amen and then the next part of that verse he says but we shall all be changed in other words we all will come to this body change right what a promise amen amen I mean that makes me that makes me feel I mean everything else just Fades away amen everything else the music of the world the the video games of the world the the sports of the world everything just Fades away amen when when we think about amen that there's there's a hope amen outside of this outside of this current world uh Cosmos that we're living in amen righten Christ never failed you I like something that was said this this this weekend about and about the from the brother that that this Lord willing be going to speak for us this Sunday but he said you know did Christ keep you yesterday yes is Christ keeping you now amen so that means Christ will keep you tomorrow right amen praise God and that that's that's a hope because you know Saints sometimes we we we we take a look at the things of these of this life and we feed off the the the the media of the world and the news of the world and it really start bubbling up fear in you without you even wanting it it's a tactic of the devil devil and he uses the media to do so amen and and and and you're not really sinning it's not like you're watching an rated movie or some some bad movie or something that you're not you're just watching the news right you're just looking at the news you're looking at the numbers of covid you know just going up and your eyes are getting bigger and bigger and your mouth is getting wider and wider and you know what H what's happening you're stepping away from the word of God yeah because now instead of you looking to Christ amen the author and finisher of our faith you're looking at covid numbers and that seems to be more real to you than the word of God and what happens is you're going to start acting upon it you're going to start living your life in fear knowing leaving aside the word of God right isn't that what happens see Satan Sly he don't need to he don't need to bring in there for you to listen to some worldly music or some x-rated movie or anything like that just shows you the news right exactly right well I don't know how I got into that but praise God but it's the truth I know because it's happened to me it's happened to me verse 52 now Paul continues saying here in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trump it shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall all be changed amen now we see here that in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we will be changed amen that change takes place in a Flash or in a blink of an eye right can you imagine that that the Rapture amen that your body change that you are looking forward to so much espec if you're a Christian that's the only thing that you're really Desiring amen is a is a body change it it should be the the the hope and the and and the and the thing that you're looking for to especially you older ones it's something it's a promise that that that that the scripture says but it's something that's going to take place in a moment in a twinkling of an eye I want to see everybody blinking their eyes right now sister jul I just saw you blinking your ey it just it's it's something quick right something quick that's how quick that body change is going to be exactly and it's not just going to be a portion not not not just blinking your eye and and and only your your hands will be will be will be changed no your whole body will be changed amen your whole body I was looking at something here about 5G have you heard of 5G the 5G is coming on the scene now um and it's the next step is the next connection uh after what we have now is 4G and LTE on on on mobile care carriers uh uh cell phones and the next connection step or the next connection phase is 5G now let just listen to this how 5G is so significantly faster 5G delivers up to 20 gigabits per second amen per uh Peak data rates and 100 megabits per second average data rates now here's an example of what that means just how fast is 20 gigabits really it can be demonstrated by a simple example a user takes around 13 minutes to download the content of a DVD now you have a DVD we all probably have them at home and they can you can extract the contents of that DVD and it'll probably be about maybe five gigs five gigabytes worth of data from that DVD to put it online so if you wanted at this current moment if you wanted to download that those 5 gigabytes amen it would take you 13 minutes to download those five those 5 gigabytes if you had a uh a connection like a DSL connection with only with a bandwidth of only 50 megabits per second that's kind of you know it's kind of uh kind of average right now the connections right now at internet at home amen but now watch what a 5G enabled smartphone can do or a laptop it could download that same content of an entire DVD on Mobile 5G data link in just two seconds in the best case scenario I me from 13 minutes to two seconds that's that's pretty that's pretty good that's pretty fast you that you can download a whole movie let's just say benur or the Ten Commandments download it in about two seconds have it on your phone ready ready to watch that's pretty fast but do you realize that the body changes much faster your the body changes faster than two seconds right body changes faster than than than 5G body changes faster than anything else that man will ever come out with if we're here longer amen it's going to happen much quicker than that amen this change that Paul is talking about is much faster than this 5G amen praise God much faster cuz two seconds it doesn't take you two seconds to Blink unless you have problems with your [Laughter] eyes you know I me we we blink I mean that's less probably some of less than a second you see and Paul says here in a moment in a twinkling of an eye at the last Trump amen amen now this Trump amen this trumpet amen uh let's look here 1 Thessalonians chap 4:1 16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God now brother Brandon made this clear in the message the Rapture of what these three things are right amen and and if the brothers could pull up this quote brother Bram says here it's a real short quote but he makes it very concise and I added some things parenthesis just to kind of show you uh what brother Brandon was talking about there the first thing comes forth is his message which is the shout amen calling the bride together the next thing is a resurrection of the sleeping bride that's the voice of the son of man amen amen that's the voice that Paul's talking about there in 1 Thessalonians 4:16 with a shout with the voice of the Archangel amen and do you realize that that voice is in you and I this house exactly amen The Voice of the son of man is in you tonight amen you and I are going to be part of calling of of of of of bringing those resurrected Saints amen not that we're going to be out there in the graves or calling them out or anything like that but there's going to be such a pull amen because we're so connected to the word and the word amen the son of man Ministry in us that called amen Lazarus from the grave that did all those things when the son of man uh was was here on Earth Jesus Christ amen and a Resurrection took place amen that same son of man is in Us in this hour praise God that same Jesus Christ amen that voice is in the Bride As I was as I was reading those quotes last time I was ministering here the voice now is in the bride glory amen exactly do you believe that I I believe that with all my heart Amen to you as a born again what Born Again believer amen that voice is in you and I in this hour and you're going to be part part of that magnetism amen that will bring amen this the the dead from from the from from the ground amen that Resurrection amen the voice of the son of man now then brother Brown continues saying here the ones died back in the other ages they're caught together and the trumpet the feast in the heavens in the sky that's the Rapture or the catching away of the Bride why that's the thing that takes place friends so that is the that is what the Trump of God is it's that calling away amen it's that Rapture amen praise God is that meeting in the air is that is that meeting in for for the marriage supper of the of of the lamb and the bride amen praise God the trumpet is very important amen praise God Amen so that is what Paul is bringing out there in this verse verse 52 and we go back to it in a moment in the twinkling of an ey at the last Trump amen at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised now watch what he says here and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible not that it they they might raise there's a possibility there's a there's a 50% chance that they might rais no the dead shall be raised shall I mean Paul was certain Paul was certain can you imagine that and how much more certain we would be in this hour when we have the complete open word in this we should be even more certain about that and more preoccupied in it than we should be about covid numbers and stuff like that amen that we shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall all be changed right amen that makes me happy amen I don't know about you man that that that just does something to me you know it it just it it uh it just Fades everything else out right it makes me want to go home and see what else can I get rid of Amen that I need to get rid of Amen it makes me want to go look through my phone list and see who else I need to call to make things right with someone or or do something you see and it should do the same thing for you praise God verse 53 says for this corruptible must Paul's speaking here again must put on incorruption right and this Mortal must put on immortality amen and and it would seem like this verse right here uh contradicts the first verse that Paul was speaking or the ver verse 50 because in that verse 50 Paul was saying that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither do corruption inherit incorruption but Paul's here in verse 53 he's saying this corruptible must put on incorruption right and this Mortal must put on immortality amen but see you have to realize that in in verse 50 Paul was speaking about the natural man the unregenerated man the unconverted man cannot inherit right the kingdom of God Amen you see the the natural man in this earth cannot step into a body change that body change only belongs to the bride of Christ right because she's got God in her soul you see but what Paul is talking about here in verse 53 he's speaking of the Bride amen who already has the the Holy Ghost in their soul in other words the new birth praise God so it we must come to that point amen and we are coming to that point I believe amen I believe Saints we are coming to that point amen praise God so the there there's there's no way to to to stop this from coming amen when you've when you've got Christ in your heart and you're and you're growing on a daily basis you're growing in that stature amen you're growing in you're growing in that life amen you're coming to that head amen there's no way for you to to to not come to that to that body change right amen you've got to come every because that you're part of his body right you're part of his life amen and you've got to come to this 2 Corinthians 5:4 tells us for we who are in this tent in other words in this body in this tent we groan being burdened not because we want to be unclothed but further clothed that mortality may be swallowed up by life amen I like the way the New Living Translation says it and we I believe I put it here the brothers can put it on there it says while we live in these Earthly bodies we Gran and sigh but it's not that we want to die and get rid of these bodies that clothe us rather we want to put on our new bodies so that these dying bodies will be swallowed up by life amen right now we know it's not a new body your body the one that you currently have amen if you're here for that change amen that's what's going to be transformed it's not that God has another body there for you waiting no it's this body made new praise God Amen because this is what you know this is what God gave you this is your possession amen and this is what God is wanting to restore amen because because this was in his mind amen this is what he gave he gave you was part of him as well amen you have a connection to this Earth with this body another body somewhere else or anything like that has no connection to this earth and we you and I are to live in this earth amen throughout all eternity right Earth Heaven and Earth will kiss together right and this is going to be our home Glory praise God but it ain't going to be in the condition that we see it right now Saints there's not going to be any devil there's not going to be any demons there's not going to be any movements there's not going to be any of that such things no virus no anything like that amen there's nothing going to be the but the Bride In Christ amen and his original creation and whatever else God wants to give us right cuz I don't think that we're going to stop learning from God when we get there right he he's an eternal God and there is no ending to what we're going to be able to man he's just a circle he's a circle and we just continue learning there's no there's no there a circle has no end you see that's why I like that song will The Circle Be Unbroken amen there's no Circle that's why it's represented eternal life is represented as a circle or as a number eight there's no ending to it amen praise God verse 54 I'm going I'm going to I'm going to make sure that you guys leave early tonight so I kept you a while last time so I don't want to keep you tonight too long verse 54 says so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory oh my and and Paul again he positive about these changes taking place right he is not negative about it he knows that it's going to be praise God again how much more should we should we be positive and know that these things are going to be do you know that this this phrase death is swallowed up in Victory is found in in Isaiah chapter 25 so Paul many things that Paul would say many phrases that he would say he really was saying or reiterating something that was already said in the old test and and we read it in Isaiah 25:6 now listen to this look what look what Look What the Lord through Isaiah is speaking is speaking here very interesting it says and in this mountain I like that amen CU we're coming to that we're coming to that Mountaintop amen shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things a feast of wines on the leaves of fat things full of marrow of of wines on the leaves well refined verse 7 and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people and the veil that is spread over all nations he will destroy in this mountain the face covering cast over all people amen praise God that's that covering that we have right now this this Mortal body that we have Upon Us amen God's going to get get rid of that amen all right God's it's already working in us and it's going to be it's going to be shred to pieces one day amen praise God and completely come out it's kind of like like I don't know if you've seen an animal shed its skin or you've seen the the the skin of a of a snake on the side they there's a struggle you know there's a struggle sometimes as they coming out and it's even kind of filming their eyes and things like that amen but eventually they come out right the the the thing is left there is that is that old skin amen praise God and they're walking around with a new with a new body amen with a new amen and so he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people and the veil that is spread over all nations now watch verse eight he says he will swallow up death in Victory exactly what Paul said there in verse 54 and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the Earth for the Lord hath spoken it glory amen and that and it shall be said in that day Lo This Is Our God we have waited for him and he will save us this is the Lord we have waited for him and he will be glad and rejoice in his salvation hallelujah amen but you see you should be saying that now you don't wait till we get there you say it now amen so has even more meaning when you're saying it then amen praise God oh we thank God for his salvation thank God for his word amen thank God for his transforming power in our lives amen without him we would be nothing right amen we without him we would be falling amen without him we'd be in a hospital or in a casket somewhere in this hour I know I would be if it wasn't for what he's done for us and his Mercy the mercy and the grace that he's that he's shed abroad our hearts amen praise God Amen and Pa Paul continues saying in that last part of the verse then shall be brought to pass saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory and in Hebrews chap 2:14 the Bible tells us amen for as much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood that's that's you and I right we're partakers of Flesh and Blood he also speaking of Jesus he also himself likewise took part of the same but why did he he do it the Bible says there that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil exactly right how it's so amazing how God thinks amen Satan always thinks that he has something over God right and God is always several steps ahead amen and that's the god that you and I serve in this hour amen it took a death to D destroy uh the power of death amen it took God dying it took it took Jesus Christ dying on the cross in order to destroy the one who had those keys of death Hell In The Grave amen praise God and that death is swallowed up in Victory as Paul's saying here death is swallowed up in Victory amen amen now verse 55 says oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory amen so since death has been swallowed up in in in in has been swallowed up then Paul comes here and asks where is thy sting where oh grave where is thy victory in other words what you have no you have no uh uh um you have no more influence upon upon upon the believer right there's no more influence there Satan thinks he has influence on the believer amen and if you he will have influence if you allow him right he has influence right amen but as but as the thing is that Satan when he when he's uh he met his challenge there on the cross he was that he was that bee brother Brown talks about it that bee that that that was flying buzzing around and saying I'm going to get you I'm going to get you isn't that isn't that what Satan sometimes comes around talking to us say I'm going to get you you're feeling this oh you hurt right here oh it could be a clogged artery oh oh yeah yeah and you're trying you're calling you're seeing who who you're looking on Google what is this pain what is this what is this symptom what is and and you know the more you're sitting there looking through Google and reading WebMD and all that when you could just be going to the word of God Amen and reading the promises of God and saying his stripes I am healed amen he died for my for my healing amen right praise God and we have more faith in Google and Facebook and and and these these things than we do the word of God WebMD has more more influence in our lives than the word right in the message well you know it's the truth I've been there done that I have the t-shirt and the mouse pad to go on with it to go with it listen I'm with you I I you know I I just turned 40 and every now and then now I'm feeling little aches or some little things that just come and and I and I know if I'm feeling them now the more I live probably it's going to get worse just things just random things just [Laughter] come you Brothers I know you Brothers can say this it's probably worse I know but just little things [Laughter] but you know what I know that it's because this body's dying right this body is not Eternal there's an eternal one inside of theide of it that is wanting to come out and express itself completely in this flesh as well in this Flesh and Blood amen but when that time comes amen you won't be worrying about your little pains and AES anymore know those things amen WebMD what is that Google ah oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory so Satan he had met his challenge there when he stung Jesus At The Cross now now brother Wade was here he'd probably he'd probably be be able to confirm but you know how brother Wade he works with honeybees and a honeybee from my understanding is the only be that if it stings for example a human being or something a mammal uh when they try to when they try to get away it rips their whole the stinger out out of them and completely deuts them from the in I mean their intestines come out and and uh uh and and they die they end up dying now a wasp or or a Hornet or some of those you know those other types of bees they can sting you and they can continually they can they can take it out and and go on and sting another day but a honeybee can't do that amen now a honeybee think about this Saints a honeybee is probably one of the least bees that we are we are scared of when there's a wasp flying around or when there's a hornet flying around or or or or something like that we you know we start waving you know we get scared you know but a honey bee you know when it's flying around you know and and it's uh you some some of us some of us are just scared of any be but but when it's we they're more tolerable they're actually a little bit more cuter you see I know that sting is not cute and they're fuzzy but think about the Saints brother Brandon said that Satan was like that bee flying around Jesus amen and he wasn't a hornet he wasn't a wasp he wasn't as powerful as a as one of those wasps and hornets he was just a honeybee with a stinger that when it got into Jesus Christ amen Jesus Christ there on the cross he thinking that he had power over him over Jesus stung Jesus amen with the power of death and that completely de de gted uh Satan completely amen all his Machinery all of the keys everything was stripped from him and now what Satan is is just a dead honeybee flopping around all around you buzzing around with no Stinger completely and he sounds like he like he's like like like he's something dangerous in reality he's not he's actually in a worse condition now than he was before he got a hold of Jesus right exactly he's just a dead bee flopping around amen he sounds like he's dangerous he looks like he's dangerous but he's not dangerous amen so when he comes around saying you're about to die you got a clogged artery you you're you're about to you got some problem with your back or something on that line amen you can just say Satan you're just flopping around you're just flopping around you've been de gutted do you remember when Jesus died and he W and when he when he died and went went in the grave when they B married him amen he went to hell and the Bible and brother brand says that he went in there and took the keys and stripped them off Satan he said give me those keys those keys belong to me and Satan has no keys he brother R said he has the KE does not even have the keys to his own house right he's powerless especially powerless before you and I who have the Holy Ghost in our in our soul that's right amen he's just a sound a sound and and a tinkling symbol just making noise amen now one of the peculiar things about bees about honey bees and about bees in general is that when they sting you and they're going to die apparently they release these pheromones that that if they're nearby if they're near the the the the nest uh these alert pheromones that that alert other bees to come for you know to come in and and and and for help you see and uh and that's exactly what Satan has done the Bible says that he's called the Bible says that 200 thousands and thousands of the demons have been released in this hour exactly amen cuz Satan can't do it all he needs his demons he needs his minions to come in and we've seen it in this hour Saints demons upon demon do you think do you think what's currently going on in this country amen it's not been demons being released that's right right amen that's affecting the the I mean it's it's supposed to tr affect us amen how much more is it going to affect the world that has that doesn't even have God that doesn't even have a hope Amen in in in in nothing but what this what this world order can give them right W 200,000 thousands demons have been released praise God and so that's what Satan Satan needs is is he demon because he knows he has no power over you and I right he knows that his time is limited he knows that his time is is uh is uh he's got a limit to his time here so he's doing everything he can to get you if you more if he can get you to disbelieve that word amen go in there and on them websites and and look at what well this here look what the bridge and the cloud and all these things you know Satan's on the rampant on the Rampage doing that and he's got his minions working behind the scenes amen but we're powerful people in this hour Glory praise God verse 56 says the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law amen now I want us to look at something here because death could not work without sin being in the picture see sin and death they work together amen the more you sin the more you engage in sin the more spiritual dying you're you're you're you're doing you see and sometimes eventually that might lead to physical death you take for example the innocent young man that raised probably went to school went to college but one day got a hold of of of of marijuana went to a party one day got a hold of marijuana started smoking marijuana and oh I can handle this this is fine I know I was raised in a Christian home but this is okay then the marijuana doesn't do anything for him anymore so he goes on he he he goes on the next step a little bit of crack cocaine that eventually phases out now he goes to the next thing heroin or or you know whatever the harder drug the harder drug it is and and the more sin that he's engaging in he's dying spiritually and eventually That Dying spiritually that sin will eventually lead him to a physical death that's right you see so the the Bible was not incorrect when it said in in for example in James if you read with me and the brothers can pull it up James chapter 1:14 says but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed right you see when that when that when that guy came around you and said hey let's go out to this party this Friday night you know well you you know exactly what's going to go on there but because you want to fit in you just go ahead and do it and so when he has drawn away of his own lust and enticed verse 15 says then when lust in other words I've been thinking about it should I should I not yo man this man this might make make me fit in a little bit better with the guys I've been wanting to to you know to get around them you know oh and so that lust starts working you see that's the lust part when lust hath conceived right it bringeth forth sin right all right and then sin when it is finished it bringeth forth death right right now you could take that spiritual death and it could lead to physical death too see but but Saints being spiritual dead amen it's probably worse CU you especially you living in iniquity and you know that you're you're you're living in sin and you know that you need to get right and you're still not doing what you're supposed to do amen that's a terrible way to live I remember when I was out in the world when I was young and and uh I had not known the message I had not come to the message yet but I was still a Baptist but my mom and dad had taught me better had raised me better you know and the Baptist in the Baptist ways and the Baptist Doctrine and the Baptist life and I got away from that I got away from that to go party to go drink to go these things and all all this stuff but the whole time my whole life I could not really fit in with the people oh yeah it was like I'm sitting there having fun but at the same time I'm not it is a terrible feeling I know some of you probably know what I'm talking about it's a it's a it's a terrible feeling you can't and you see that there rejoicing and having fun and and and and it doesn't bother them to do this that or the other but I couldn't fully get into what they were doing yeah because why the word of God had already been had been planted in my life right amen I hope you don't come to that place young man young young girl young amen serve God that you have the opportunity to do so now cuz then later on you may not have that opportunity amen serve him now while you can take advantage now of church take advantage now of the things that your parents are trying to do for you to help you to live a more uh vibrant life in Christ amen don't say it don't see it as oh I'm so bored I can't wait till this service gets out I want to go home and play Playstation what is that going to do for your soul right what is sports going to do for your soul it can't take you to Glory yeah you're not going to you're not going to heaven with a basketball in your hand that's not Eternal amen it's okay you if you play basketball it's okay if you play some video games or whatever but don't put that before God you put that before God then that's your God PlayStation and Xbox is your god and your word is not your God right amen and maybe you'll understand when you get if you get older you might think that crank up there that all he talks about is me getting right amen but you realize when you get older and you've and you've passed through something in your life on the verge of dying I've been on that on that verge of almost dying drowning in an ocean just a few years ago and if it wasn't for the grace of God I don't know I I'd be dead tonight so so the more that we engage in sin Saints is the more you are dying spiritually amen and what fueled sin was having to abide by the law amen now Paul says here and the strength of the sin is the law amen and and what fueled that more is the fact is knowing that you could not even keep the law right you see right what a what a what a what a thing to to know God has given us this law you know and for the for the Saints in the old test I mean for the for the for the Israelites but they couldn't fulfill the law and God knew that they could not do it but that's the reason why Jesus Christ came and fulfilled that law for us amen he came and did it for us amen so that's the reason why he could take everything upon Him amen and all we have to do is take his sacrifice everything that he's done amen applied in our lives amen and we're good to go believe on his word believe on what he's done for you amen and it's what Paul says here but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory right through our Lord Jesus Christ in other words giveth amen it's a continual giving amen which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ Jesus Christ fulfilling the law amen right it it robbed it of its condemning power Upon Us amen him fulfilling that law robbed it his death and his resurrection is a pledge of our Resurrection amen Because He Lives I Can Face Tomorrow amen Because He Lives amen I can move on because he lives even if I die I know that I'll be raised again because he lives amen I know that this body change no matter if I'm 90 years old no matter how old I am this body will receive a change Amen to that image that God saw me before the the foundation of the world amen amen which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ amen so our future is certain we have a certain future Saints amen I don't know about what's going to happen tomorrow amen I don't know what's going to happen in two in two months I don't know what's going to happen in two years amen but I know what's going to happen amen according to what the word tells us right if I look at the word then I know what's GNA happen if I look at the media I don't know what's GNA happen that's uncertain this is certain amen I'll Bank my soul on this any day amen praise God our future is certain and our Victory is one which God gives now through Jesus Christ now amen now we are sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now we're sitting in those places John 16:33 tells us these things I have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace in the word world you shall have tribulation Jesus said see he didn't say that you're not going to have tribulation he said that you are in the world you are going to have tribulation you are going to wake up with body aches in your in your in your body you are going to wake up with somebody past away you are going to wake up with bad news and you are going to wake up with bad things that happen in your life and your car broke down or whatever amen but cheer cheer he says but be of good cheer I have overcome the world amen amen that's put a stamp of of of approval on that seal on on that amen but be of good cheer I have overcome the world Amen and if this mystery who Christ in you Christ in you that mystery amen Jesus Christ in you the hope of glory is in you then the overcoming power is in you tonight that same overcoming power no matter what has happened amen you're just an overcome of the world because he's already overcome but be of good cheer I have overcome the world Romans 8:37 tell us nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us right it says there that we're not just conquerors we're more than conquerors exctly oh my more than conquerors amen you like it when you get a little bonus amen or a little extra something added to your meal there the drive-thru right I me when they give you those an extra extra order of fries and you didn't ask for any yeah oh that's good and you say I didn't I didn't I didn't order these fries you know because you want to make sure you're not stealing you know or whatever you want to make sure they oh that's all right we wanted we wanted to do that for you oh makes you want to go there the next day and order more that we are more than conquerors amen God's given us more amen that's that little extra benefit amen of not just being conquerors but more than conquerors amen praise God more that's going to lead us to a body change those are the bonuses of being these conquerors or having the Conqueror in US amen a body changed amen our bodies changed from Mortal to Immortal right what a bonus praise God in verse 58 and I'll end with this last verse Paul says there therefore my beloved Brethren this is this is Paul's admonishment to us my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord ah I don't see where Xbox fits in there or uh being caught caught up in anything else outside of Christ you know always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord anything that you do for Christ will not go unnoticed by Christ amen so if you come to if you come to church amen for the benefit of your soul and for supporting the the the the the the the the ministry and and and for and for the help of the ministry amen here in the body amen amen you're do God sees that that right God sees your intentions and that's not going to go unnoticed amen any little prayer that you might give for the body or for somebody who is going through a hard time nobody might have noticed it but God noticed it right amen God notices and he and he has it in mind amen if you did it with a hopeful int with the right intention with the right attitude amen God notices it right anything that you would do amen God notices so be steadfast un removable don't let just any old thing come through and Shake you in this hour Satan again he has his minions amen he has his his his people and but you got to remember Satan's just just shaking around just buzzing around and he has no power right that probably looks weird me doing that but that's what Satan looks like he's just a bluff Saints right need a bluff amen God bless you amen for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord amen Saints we are looking forward to some great things in this hour right somebody's got to fulfill this scripture that's right amen yes sir do you do you realize that this scripture has not been fulfilled right in first Thessalonians I think it chapter 4 there it hasn't been fulfilled that's right somebody some's got to do it Glory I think it's some of these young people that are still with us am man somebody's going to fulfill this this the scripture I believe it's going to be us in this hour amen cuz I just can't see this thing amen going another it's just hard for me to see it go

world do me with the Rapture on my mind oh lately all I've God is leing on my mind seems that's all I'm thinking about oh it seems that's all I'm thinking about most of the time how that soon and very soon I'll leave these trou far behind oh lately i' got [Music] Le leaving on my mind let's sing that second verse again again so I guess so I guess I should be looking for a better place to live but I can't seem to get excited but I can't seem to get excited about this world and what it all can give I couldn't care less I couldn't care less if I could buy it all with a solitary D for what good for what good would this world do me with leaving on my mind oh lately all I've got is leaving on my mind oh it seems that's all I'm thinking about most of the time how that soon and very soon I'll leave

bride's desire in this hour amen hope that's your desire amen those Saints are waiting for us amen they're just right here in another dimension and just pushing us amen keep faithful on to the word amen because it's worth it All Saints glory amen just keep on keep oh you're waking up and you're not sure if you should go to church this morning or not but those Saints are pulling for you to go to church amen amen those Saints are pulling for you to read that word amen no matter how tired you are pray amen no matter how tired you are amen continue doing those things that will help you move on to meeting them amen sooner sooner amen praise God God bless you Saints amen uh yes sister go ahead I heard about it maybe maybe a week ago and um I was I was on my YouTube page um and stuff but anyway this this channel came up and um the speaker from Israel was saying how they have actually started preaching about Jesus Christ there and they've been doing it for five years now and how they're so excited for this New Hope and everything and that they're spreading the gospel and everything to me I didn't even know that I didn't know that was already going on and that's an eye opener because I know brother BR mentioned something about watch Israel if you want to know what time it is right right I also know about um how Jesus was saying he's going to turn from the Gentiles and go to the Jews I don't I probably don't have it all you know and I I probably got to listen to the message get it all clear but I didn't know it was even that close to where they actually already believing in Jesus Christ amen he was saying um how they had um it's Israel population is about 9 million but it's been 27 million Jews already just on their website learning about all this and they're saying how excited they are and how they got this new hope now and um they're just excited about this yeah and they they didn't know about it and they I mean I was I was shocked to hear about it I don't know if anybody else heard about it praise the Lord yeah thank you for sharing that sister yes that there's Jews in the in the world and even throughout the world who who who are they they they know Jesus Christ and they they believe in Jesus Christ maybe th that group might be an influence to what's coming later with the two witnesses I'm not sure but but I believe things are transitioning amen the holy spirit is leaving amen is is brother Bram said that the holy spirit is is is leaving this this Gentile this Gentile and moving back to Israel is going to deal with the with the with the Israel but those two witnesses have to be on the scene right amen because the thing is those two witnesses would come with the spirit of Elijah and the spirit of of of Moses uh and uh they're they're not going to listen to anybody but their own prophets right so that that's got to be influential so that's very very good that that's and that could be a transitioning thing that might be happening so Saints you know it's seeing these things happen together and and the views that because people are interested in that I mean even the nominal world they're interested in what happens in Israel oh yeah so it's probably why those those those those videos have so many views um because people are have their eyes there on what happens in Israel so they're they're God's time piece they're God's time clock amen you want to know what God's doing you look at what's happening in Israel look what God's doing in Israel amen amen anybody else have a comment or Brother D every all M brother okay his name is brother Fabian brother Fabian Palma and uh so he'll be here with us so uh the He he'll sing he'll sing some songs we'll make sure that that is songs that you can sing along
