TRANSCRIPT
========================================
where they standing outside baster that's all pray before we start I only father we think it's let's get together today in your name and pray bless services today here and let's brother way better your mobile call bow and pray that you will bless all the little bride around the world Lord just really to work to us give us understanding of you and thank you for this day Lord did she raise two thousand years ago we rolled about in the first things thank you for all the blessings you've given us most of all for your Holy Spirit thank you for revelation on your word and again this beautiful for the way it says for doing all those and Alabama and given the tribe immerses back I pray in Jesus name do you have your own bottles turn to Luke 24 I'm a little old-fashioned old-fashioned and have this listen if you don't have it I'm just I'm sorry Luke Luke 24:1 now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre and they entered and is found not the body of the Lord Jesus and it came to pass that were much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments and as they were afraid they bowed down their faces to the earth and they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead he is not here but just risen remember how he spake them to you when he was yet in Galilee this is Luke 24 seven saying the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again and they remembered his words and returned from the sepulchre and told all these things and eleven and do all the rest it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women that were with them which told these things unto the Apostles and their words seemed to them as hotels and they believed them not then arose Peter and ran unto the sepulchre and stooping down he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and departed wandering and himself at that which was coming to pass verse 13 and behold two of them went the same day to a village called mass which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs and they talked together all these things which had happened and it came to pass while they came together and reason Jesus himself drew near and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him and they said up to seven them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk in are sad and the one of them whose name was Cleopas sensory and said unto Him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and has not known the things which are coming to pass here these days and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified Him but which Russell did that have been him than he which should have redeemed Israel and aside all this today is the third day since these things were done yea and certain women also of her company made us Sistani which were early at the sepulchre and when they found not his body that came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the sucker and found that even so swimmer said about him they saw none then he said unto them o fools are slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken all not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory the beginning of Moses and all the prophets he expounded them in the Scriptures the things concerning himself okay we'll stop there make sure I'm staying in there okay today I'm going to go the objective right up front the objective today is to see that a daily choice to seek God is not optional but critical for special spiritual growth and I wanted to say to enjoy brother way to sermon this past Sunday because when he asked her to teach Sunday School Sunday morning last week I prayed and said or what would you have been teaching by the end of the service it was very clear to me what a negative teach on is very heavy on my heart this week and brother Wei preached a little bit in the second service about his new birth his journey very clear the journey of justification sanctification death the Holy Ghost and I've been dwelling on my experience throughout this week and I may or may not tie some of that into this lesson but the point is I think we need to think a lot about that and consider that but he taught him beautifully with that sixth seal sermon so the tile today is choosing Christ okay and this lesson I know automatically by the title of it a lot of you might think well that's for babe's Ryan's going to talk teach a lesson too young ones just coming in or something but this is really for everybody at every stage of your spiritual growth whether you're in the headstone or whether you just started a finger journey this goes for this applies to everybody it's not just for new Christmas choose you this day whom you will serve as for me and my house we will serve the Lord and the reason is so heavy on my heart is I've seen this for a long time but more here lately I've seen that people are seem to be thinking about Christianity about the new birth or whatever you want to call it as like a one-time thing like it's a an event that transpired rather than a process I think of it as a process there was a time of my life especially as a Baptist when I thought it was more like an event I got saved past tense it's done it's over now I'm going on to other things and that was kind of my mentality I think that's a lot of people's mentality about the reverse now in the message well I got the run again and now here I'm waiting on everybody else you know and that shouldn't their attitude so what what I'm talking about in this lesson is choosing Christ over and over again as a daily journey at the start of your day all throughout the day all the different ways that you seek God where you when you get up in the morning you first thing you do hit the floor and pray for a little while and that's choosing Christ and then maybe go read your Bible for a few minutes and that's choosing Christ and then why you only way to work you meditate on these things that things have been preached to things you read that's choosing Christ and the network you think on about well today maybe you pray without ceasing you have a profile a tooth that's choosen Christ on through your whole day all up to you go to bed at night you think about the Lord you pray read meditate your studies think on these things sing songs of worship and praise when I Drive at night I kind of have my own little church service I listen to sermons until I get sleepy I'll start getting slave doctrine on gospel music and have and sort of invite the Holy Spirit in to my truck as a way of praise and worship because he inhabits the praises of his people so that's no way of saying Lord now come in the couch and reveal yourself to me and then I'll starting the meditation and start thinking on these things you think that put me to sleep but that actually writes me a lot our adversary greatly desires to stop us from seeking God Satan realizes that Christians gain great strength from daily prayer Bible reading meditation fellowship and assembling with other believers and all the other aspects of the Christian life is powerless against the revealed Word of God therefore he tries to hinder us from receiving revelation tactics of the enemy so I've been thinking about a guy I work with is Hispanic he's a Catholic and he said he made a comment to me in one time he said when you die you're going to heaven or hell I said heaven he still are you sure I got a thing about it later on and he believes in purgatory because he's a Catholic I don't understand fully but I think what they believe it's basically that no matter how you live you die go to hell for a time to pay for your sins is that best thing just of it okay so I don't know but that's - damned purgatory if I was taught that and I believe that I live a pretty sloppy life I wouldn't care about sanctification I'm worried about reading the Bible or going to church cuz I gotta go to hell anyway when I die so what does it matter what kind of life you live and it kind of just I think that's what they did if it's not that I'm totally wrong forget us it but I think that's my understanding perfect is that they they go there for a while pay for their sins and they and then I got but anyway if that's what he believed it's no wonder why he lives just like all the other sinners that I work with that aren't even Christians he cusses like crazy and tells nasty jokes and all that kind of thing no concern about a Christian life or anything then but yet there are some Catholics who are really sincere buried the bobbum do go to masses and all those things so I'm not everybody it's just a dentist tactic he's trying to stop people from seeing God and the Baptist I wasn't directly taught once saved always saved but it was kind of a generally understood concept when you get saved no matter what you do the rest of your life you're going to go to heaven and so I've seen many people in the Baptist we're almost there that would get saved and then go out there but the devil never come to church never eat the Bible never pray and somehow magically they're going to just go to heaven when they got and I don't understand that but that's what the devil teaches people just stop him from seeking God okay so why seek God if I prayed the prayer of salvation I'm saved no matter what I do and then but yeah as a Baptist I did reading pray I remember I want to pray but I didn't I didn't think it was a necessity I did it more like because I just want know more about God so there are some people are sincere about his church but there are a lot of them that because of that concept they don't seek God all right number three seed doctrine this is one of many in the message that we've heard of and it's very common it's very common more often I think more places believe that than not but why seek God if I came with a seat and this is the doctrine I'm talking about that you can receive in you of eternal life by you're not lay there dormant and then with a work contract path that just came to life and that's it you're done you're all set devil says you're okay sit down or don't even come to church at all doesn't matter you're okay well I seek God if I came with a seat in it I'm either pre dispatcher eternal life or I'm not pertinent to eternal life what does it matter about what I do whether I seek God or not that's the concept tactics love to them these and many other false doctrines are used by saying to try to stop us from seeking God Satan knows that God promises to reward those that seek Him he rewards them with revelation which Satan is powerless against okay a lot of people the message is seems like to them the new birth is like when they got born again also there in the headstone and there's no growth process you can talked about or even thought of and it's just like youth you are yeah I got born again I'm okay I'm in the headstone I'm ready for the rapture all right it doesn't work like that [Music] Matthew 16 and I say also under thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it hey that's the scripture I'm referring to unless like the gates of Hell cannot prevail against the revealed Word of God that's what we want he does not want us to have it and he is fervently trying to keep us from coming to that in any way I'm just showing you some of his tactics but he's trying to stop us from finding that Hebrews 11:6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that comes to God must believe that he is that he is a reward of damned ability to seek Him and I'll read the scripture in another slide because it's coming up again revelation 3 behold I stand at the door knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him in here with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down my father in his promise and matthew SE mark 13 and ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that shall endure to the end the same shall be saved i think that's the one brother wait folks a lot but there's an enduring and there's an overcoming and not just a sitting and waiting on something to happen that's not what we're seeing the picture so it must overcome Laodicea we have to overcome what I call busyness not a business establishment busyness as in we're also busy that's one day after a common I don't say put down things and don't do anything just put God first give them the tithe of your time right off the top start of the day we're as quick as you can in your day the first opportunity read the Bible and pray and do that every day and then go your flowerbeds or your you know work or whatever whatever that's you have to do because we all have things to do so this overcoming false doctrine overcoming our own ideas against the word and our own ideas that we're okay that we don't need a sitcom those are things get it show endure to the end shall be saved and about the overcoming john 5:39 search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and there they which testify of me now I put this little note Jesus speaking to the Jews a group of people very studied in the work so say he's talking these people who are who have studied a lot I'm talking about studying a lot but you know see God for revelation they had a lot of the understanding of the letter okay but but not the revelation with it and a lot of man's ideas and theology mixed in with it we must not only study the letter word but carefully prayerfully let it be mixed with faith living God and trusting him to quicken it to us okay so our part studying pray let's make herself available his part is to reveal it okay we can't prevent it to ourselves we're not saying that but we have to get into the word Hebrews for one let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them that was the Jews if you go back in the previous chapter you storm out the Jews huh I put that in there and somehow it got left out anyway them the Jews but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith and then they heard it I'm gonna pause for just a second let me see if I can fix this what happened I never got the internet to connect so I'm having to go on one of these that I recently there's like my backup version and never could get the internet to connect so there was a few things left out of here so that's all right we'll do our best okay modern myths make clear about prophecy it's got to be the unleavened bread of God the Word of God the unadulterated Word of God which man shall live by every word receives out of mouth of God okay now here in this church we've heard that I go for the word for many years an adult read it means not mixed with false doctrine and man's ideas and brother Dale was always fought against the false doctrines all of our ministers preaching against the boss doctrines and brandish straight line the truth so we have an opportunity a great opportunity to see the truth and to take a body change in the rapture and see the resurrection all those things but and we don't have an excuse okay but that's what it takes is the unadulterated Word of God but we still have to study and commit to to read listening to the things one thing man gave you like to do is go back and download those the quotes the sermon notes that all ministers use with their sermon those are up on the Internet y'all can download those and go back and read those notes between services after each service go back and read those notes and helps you stay more in tune with what's being preached [Music] see seventh week of town and I think if Daniel reading the prophets before him and had this kind of an understanding that he was near the end and sought God to find out how close the end was and I think we're justified by saying that were at the end of the road now put on non sackcloth and ashes but throw off the things of the world in our cares of this life and seek God to find out what day of the year we are in because we're see we're at the end and so that the church will fast and pray and be ready okay and steps birth man this is the thing that I'm interested in the kingdom of God whether I maintain my home whether I maintain my family Worth or maintain whatever it is let me maintain Christ our hope of glory well okay I might eventually have to just get on the internet because okay yeah because it's not that way and y'all let me pause for a minute thank amongst ourselves pretty sure something is gonna be it's not gonna be left out every month that's that's a good idea it says connected but it's just showing it's really weak so pretty sure I'm going to miss something but I'll put that on hotspot that's it how many that's very often so now Thanks so quiet say I left out my house I don't know what else was missing some part about that now I don't remember read this one yet but my moderates still read that one young memory okay okay I read that yeah exactly and I read seven weeks of Daniel fast and pray every read that read this let's pick up there Hebrews 3 4 we are micro takers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast in this again while this said today if you hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation you said will run around I have a part in my heart I believe and I'm thinking if you don't go on and pray and studying seek out that could be a final part in your heart because if you have a hard heart God can't deal with you if you've cut off all these channels then how can you come in see you must infiltrate into your being in some way and I like to open up all the ways I possibly can my lord my lord I pray Lord study and I'm seeking new and coming to church reading the Bible and listening sermons and all these different ways trying to leave as many channels open for God to come into as possible I'm not doing this to make fun of anybody okay I don't know who that guy is just found a picture on the Internet yeah you I'm yeah it just saves me yeah all right I'm trying to paint a picture in y'all's mind of what's happening here or what I believe is happening this is kind of overemphasized for effect okay something anybody here doing this I'm just saying dear Lord I'm just desperate for more of you I want you to take control to my life as I surrender everything to you well if you're if this is how you are and this is how you just kind of relax and the leg back and Laodicean and and stand up on all the modern events and and everything in your news and social media or whatever whatever your thing is that's distracting you I have my things that distract me and you know just everybody has some little things that kind of get in their way shun those things I'm not saying don't do them I'm just saying put Christ first choose Christ first and but if you approach God like that I'm pretty sure he won't hear what you're saying because he's not convinced you know if you're not really convinced you won't be concerned if he's not convinced that you're convinced if you're laid back like that and saying you know nowhere does he never fast you never studied you never pray van gogh's would be like are you sure you're really desperate here yeah and pictures are worth a thousand words the pictures speak for themselves okay [Applause] so I'm making yourself available to I want to make that point it's not it doesn't mean to just say Lord Here I am making yourself available it's more like a lot of times actions more than words you know you just make yourself available by studying and seeking God now here's another example I don't have to really go and read that y'all know the essence here this is a Pharisee in the public and Jesus talked about them in Luke 18 verse 9 basically the first thing the publican went to the temple to pray the Pharisee said Lord I fast several so many times in the week and I give tithes of all that I possessed and he said I'm not like this publican you know and the publican wouldn't even hold wouldn't lift up his head but he held his head down smote upon his breast and said it will be merciful to me a sinner so what to them too went down to their house justified and Jesus said that obviously the publican well that should be our attitude this is not the way we approach God with Lord I'm in the message I've been here so many years I've read all these tapes and I've listened I read all the books and listen to all the tapes and snabel should be like him the humble approach if brother Dale says to read across the mystery and you've read it 80 times read it 81 you know what I mean because now there's something coming forth that there's light coming forth that maybe it was darkness to you before but if you're going do like he says and read that for the 80th or 81st time you might get something you didn't get the last time you will actually I believe you without a doubt because the word of god is eternal it just keeps unfolding and you can read the same one sermon a hundred times and get something new every time john 15 if you abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you his word can only abide in you after it's been quickly otherwise it can just be a good thought your mind and you can be talked out of it psalm 119:11 thy word have i hid in my heart my heart that i might not sin against thee i this is good versus perfect what I'm talking about is the words good addresses perfect faith the words good the first is perfect then when God starts something it is pure nothing wrong with it but it still requires growth or maturity for example babies start life with all they need they just need growth seeds finding the earth have all they need then just need growth new believers come to God for salvation likewise they need prose x19 he said unto them have ye received the Holy Ghost since she believes so there's a believing there's a start there's a justification or salvation and we'll call it then there's also a sanctification go on keep going and then there's a sanctification of cleansing instead of stop the source then there's a feeling of the Holy Ghost but there's no way there's a refilling and there's a continual unfolding of more of God from revelation to Revelation never stop never stop never stop seeking God so believing is the start not the end of our journey James one for every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of lights with whom is no variableness there is no variableness neither shadow of turning this is the strong some courts good means upright or agreeable so doesn't mean perfect or complete you're not in the headstone when you start at the beginning their journey it's a good gift it's from God okay but you're not complete yet but you're agreeable which means you're going to continue saying amen to the word you're going to continue moving on every time God moves you're Conner you say Amen Lord and you keep on moving up a little bit higher it moves you only into st. vacation you say Amen you keep on going you're still agreeing you're not stopping with justification and you're not stopping there sanctification you're gonna keep going and then every perfect gift strong says finished complete or full grown that's also from God and one doesn't do what the other they're both from God the beginning at the end of your journey is all for God but he's gonna keep moving you forward as long as you'll allow him to Hebrews 12 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sandwich dust so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the strong says originator like a starter and then finisher of our faith and finisher means Perfector so he originates it and then we finish it a complete set who for the joy set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God the interval for the bench set and that's what the Christian does when you're planning at Christ Jesus everything that you have need of and Earth's tourney is in you when you're seeing the Holy Spirit one thing I have to do is drink drink and push out push out just drink - you can't drink no more if you have need of divine healing go to God's Word and transform it until you push out if you need more of God just keep drinking pushing out and price an inexhaustible fountain of life and if you're finding in him the only thing out to do is drink of its goodness push it up we're gonna need open this restaurant it's all drinking the rest in peace it's not you struggle and strive and pull that you defeat the very curse of God we you representing when you do that so I'm not saying try to figure out I'm not sure maybe brother Brennan when he said you can study too much he might have been meaning like trying to figure things out because that would be studying too much I don't think as far as reading the Bible every day and listen to message every day I don't think that's staying too much and that to me is drinking drinking of the fountain I don't talk about human behavior humans are creatures of habit we form good and bad habits throughout our lives the bad habits come easy but how do we form good habits reading the Bible and the message is an example of a good habit but naturally was struggled to do this on a regular basis romans 7 19 for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do okay that's Paul saying you know in other words I want to do good but I do it wrong I want to read the message the Bible gonna do it but evil which I would not that I do Matthew 26 watch and pray that you enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak a little bit about the human will so still under the topic of human behavior but human whale is strong God gave us free choice which is a powerful thing and that we could use to serve Him or not we can choose to read his work or not we can choose to override our flesh the carnal will as well and the old saying goes where there's a will there's a way so what things can motivate us to stop our bad habits and form good habits these are just two ideas I mean we know about revelation but this is just one of my desk I don't know I'm just doing it in there just saying naturally speaking not even even talking about the Bible for a moment I'm just talking about natural things of life sometimes a behavior change can be the result of new information or a major event and life that a person experiences for example I was an idiot with handling money when Gabe and I got married I was going deep into debt and trying to dig a deeper hole my sister told me and my mom told me about Dave Ramsey new information I changed my course I quit going into and the way I was going just like everybody else going deeper into debt and I started doing making better choices it was a habit change because of new information okay when I was 15 and that was church when I was 14 I started wanting to read the Bible just because I wanna know more about God and just because I thought I mean a hypocrite because I don't know what the Bible says and I'm claiming to be a Christian I didn't think it was necessary but I thought I should do it maybe so I started reading the Bible I couldn't never get it done I would read maybe twice a week I found out about times 15 that it takes a resolve a determination if you read it every day you have to come to a resolve and just something kind of clicked with me I said if I don't make time for God I'll never find time for God but it's just kind of a click I wouldn't call it necessarily Revelation it's just more like a information or realization a realization that it wouldn't happen if you don't make it happen ok so those are examples of what I came to as just a just an on the natural side of things then a revelation when a child of God receives a revelation of the word often the result is a change in behavior and usually the more the word is revealed to a person the more he or she increases in fergus II the desire to see God more okay the prophet Elijah skip on down then we wonder sometimes well wonder why I can't have no more blessings you don't want you let down your prayer life you said well I'm a Christian well that's the more sign you should pray more than ever read the Bible every day pray every day don't make any decisions too harshly or too quickly without first considering talking about it being born again now this is from our pastor from back in September 19th last year being born again and whether the kindness was the subtitle so in the spiritual children you've got to eat the Word of God study the Word of God you know pray and seek God and ask him to reveal these things to you instead of just saying oh I believe that let it be a part of you and if you have the new birth you will desire right is that what we read you'll desire the sincere milk of the word that we may grow thereby because see that will be a part of your life why wouldn't you want to grow in Christ why would that not be your desire to want to know about God and this is brother Bob a couple months before that my steer this is July 4th last year you know that's such a strange thing for many people to grab ahold of that the opening of the word is going to take us out of here I was telling somebody about that recently they begin to say well do you mean to tell me that sounds almost like you're saying that they're saying that it's a knowledge that you're just accumulating knowledge no but what it is see God this kind of knowledge can't come just from studying like you're in a school setting or whatever but this kind of knowledge is when that book drops I'm sorry that block drops into the slot this is a bulb phrase I don't understand exactly but he's saying the rep of the word you know it's quick and becomes revelation right drops to your heart all right block drops into the slide and it begins to change your life and so that's what the experience that I'm talking about how can even approach to explain something like that unless you've lived it unless you've done unless you've gone through it it seems fantastical that's the billy-bob word it seems fantastical to imagining that the believing that living God's Word will produce him inside of you inside of your that's to allow him to a tabernacle himself inside your members that he would use your hand and use your feet and that you could yield yourself but just accumulated yourself the word by studying it and reading it and that would allow God the tabernacle himself inside of you but yet it's true I believe it and time Redemption we're almost out of time so we're going to talk about redeeming time Ephesians 5 wherefore he said awake the sleekest and arise from the dead across forgive thee like see that you walk circumspectly not as fool's but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is or what the Word of God is it's time to understand this the revelations here and is all available to us it's just time for us to get into it and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns I like that because that's the word but also hearing spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart the Lord giving thanks always for all things into God the Father and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ being your social that's another in the fear of God and this is just a few verses later husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church gave himself for it they might sanctify and cleanse with the washing of water 5 work and how can you be washed by the water the word unless you're staying in it time Redeemer this is the definition of a time Redeemer one who redeems time we are living in a very fast-paced age where we can so busy that there is no time for anything therefore we must make time for God with a not simplifying time for him time Redemption this is still the same topic but vanity gave us instructions to Daniel how can we spend waste less time gambling swimming hole on Sundays no time for the Lord okay so basically I know what I'm going to pull holes and swimming holes and gambling here but other things that let it get in our way bitter on before to an on button if from dance spell shall seek the Lord thy God and I shall find it if that city was all heart with all that soul closings 1 and unit were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now have to reconcile and the body was flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and our improvable in the side if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which he had heard which was preached and every creature lives under heaven we're about Paul administer wherefore we ought to give the more earnest heed of things where furless anytime should let them slip and basically dispense recommends how to risk a peewit neglect so great salvation no infirmities and then of Philippians one must give them the end that he would have begun a good work will perform it unto the day of Jesus Christ you have any questions thank you okay [Music]
