[0:14] give
[0:28] i would like to read in romans 6 before
[0:30] we have the fab fifteen curry
[0:34] to me this is a great great opportunity
[0:37] to get to
[0:39] come and have a baptist service
[0:42] before we like
[0:46] romans 6 says it like this what shall we
[0:49] say then
[0:51] shall we continue in sin that grace may
[0:54] abound
[0:54] god forbid how shall we that are dead to
[0:56] sin live any longer they're in
[0:58] know you not that so many of us as were
[1:00] baptized into
[1:02] jesus christ were baptized into his
[1:04] death therefore we are buried with him
[1:06] by baptism in the dead
[1:08] that like as christ was raised up from
[1:10] the dead by the glory of the father
[1:12] even so we also should walk in newness
[1:15] of life for if we have been planted
[1:17] together in the likeness of his death
[1:19] that's what your baptism is it's like
[1:21] a death to you and a coming forth to
[1:24] walk in christ right
[1:26] for we've been planted together in the
[1:27] likeness of his death we shall also
[1:29] we shall be also in the likeness of his
[1:31] resurrection
[1:33] knowing this that our old man is
[1:35] crucified with him
[1:36] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[1:38] that henceforth we should not
[1:40] serve sin for he that is dead is free
[1:42] from sin
[1:44] now if we if we be dead with christ we
[1:47] believe that we shall also live
[1:49] with him knowing that christ being
[1:51] raised from the dead dies no more death
[1:54] have no more dominion over him for in
[1:56] that he died he died under sin
[1:57] once but in that he liveth he liveth
[2:00] unto god
[2:01] likewise reckon you offer yourselves to
[2:03] be dead indeed
[2:04] unto sin but alive unto god through
[2:08] jesus christ
[2:09] our lord
[2:14] look at the baptism we see that's what
[2:16] we've read we go down into the water
[2:20] in an example just like him death burial
[2:23] and resurrection to walk in units of
[2:25] life
[2:26] so if anybody else now wants to be
[2:27] baptized we don't have no shortage of
[2:29] water
[2:30] in time come on brother
[2:34] if he will somebody lead us in
[2:38] your lord
[3:02] amen
[3:04] fulfilled the great commission that our
[3:06] lord and savior said to baptize all you
[3:08] converts
[3:09] in the name of the father and of the son
[3:12] of the holy and the holy ghost
[3:13] i baptize thee my brother michael in the
[3:16] name of the lord
[3:18] jesus christ amen
[3:41] thank you lord
[3:58] i
[4:12] yes
[4:26] where
[4:37] and
