[23:05] in
[23:07] [Music]
[23:13] amen you come to see the lord today
[23:16] turn your eyes upon jesus
[23:19] you know i was thinking
[23:22] back when
[23:23] there was nothing but a holy of holies
[23:27] that the people would
[23:28] send that priest in and
[23:31] when that
[23:32] um
[23:34] curtain would shut
[23:37] he couldn't see nothing couldn't hear
[23:39] nothing
[23:40] and all of a sudden the light comes on
[23:43] the shekinah glory would meet him in
[23:46] that room
[23:47] he couldn't hear all the hustle and
[23:48] bustle two million people
[23:51] working doing their job the animals
[23:54] blading and all that going on cars going
[23:56] by trains going by
[23:58] let's bring it to the 2022.
[24:02] he didn't hear any of that today i
[24:04] believe you i know you're the i know
[24:06] you're that temple
[24:08] but you come into a place that we ought
[24:09] to
[24:10] just shut the world out
[24:13] um as we were brother joe and i were
[24:15] talking last night
[24:17] for those of you that came to the prayer
[24:18] service thank you very much but it's
[24:20] just the time that you know number one
[24:22] and we'll talk about this afternoon and
[24:23] listen i know some of you scatter out of
[24:25] here for second service but i'd like for
[24:28] you to come back to second service if
[24:29] you can
[24:30] because we're going to talk on a measure
[24:32] of faith
[24:33] and i believe it'll help everybody
[24:35] for a measure of faith not just we we've
[24:38] got to have faith for the time brother
[24:39] dale preached it years and years ago
[24:41] that the woman at the well had faith for
[24:43] the time
[24:44] but the prayer service number one we
[24:46] made an effort to get here
[24:49] you say well i can pray at home and
[24:50] that's okay sister regina and sister
[24:52] kathy that's okay if y'all want to get
[24:54] take that seven to
[24:55] eight time and you don't have to come up
[24:57] here
[24:58] but you know what this is a sanctuary
[25:01] what does a sanctuary mean it's a place
[25:02] of safety
[25:04] when you have an animal sanctuary you
[25:05] put the animals in it and nobody gets to
[25:07] hunt them it's a sanctuary well that's
[25:09] what we do when we come here this is a
[25:11] sanctuary of god
[25:13] and i'll read this quote to you because
[25:14] brother brown said look in law in grace
[25:16] 1954 he said how we ought to come to
[25:18] church with the greatest of reverence
[25:21] how we ought to enter the church like
[25:23] real saints of god rocco walk over take
[25:25] your position i didn't say take your
[25:27] seat
[25:30] take your position
[25:34] and keep your mind on christ we ought to
[25:36] forsake everything of the world like
[25:38] that and if you're really born again
[25:40] this may cut just a little bit
[25:43] but you know this is the house of
[25:44] correction and reading them from the
[25:46] prophet if you're really born of the
[25:47] spirit of god that's where your heart
[25:49] lays anyway
[25:51] your thoughts is anchored yonder jesus
[25:54] said he that hears my words and
[25:55] believeth on him that sent me has
[25:56] everlasting life he that heareth my
[25:59] words
[26:00] and believeth
[26:02] we believe that
[26:03] as we were talking about last night
[26:04] brother joe and i that you come into
[26:06] this place
[26:07] and your cell phones are off
[26:10] kids are not screaming
[26:13] um
[26:14] you're in a sanctuary
[26:16] and god met us last night
[26:19] in this sanctuary because it was quiet
[26:22] it was a quiet place and we just had
[26:24] some soft music playing
[26:26] and if you want to enter in at home
[26:28] that's fine that is absolutely okay
[26:31] if you can't get here
[26:33] but this church was dedicated and set
[26:35] aside a long time ago for the service of
[26:37] god
[26:38] not for the service of the devil
[26:40] all right
[26:41] that's why we try our best i know he
[26:43] gets here before we do
[26:45] but we try our best to make him so
[26:47] uncomfortable that he leaves amen but
[26:50] thank you for coming to the prayer
[26:51] service we'll have another one in the
[26:52] middle of july before we go to
[26:55] um
[26:56] ohio we will have another prayer service
[26:59] here at the church on saturday sometime
[27:01] i'll announce it later
[27:03] all right remember wednesday night i'll
[27:05] be speaking wednesday night so be in
[27:07] prayer for that um brother tom ernest

[35:24] more that i can understand it
[35:28] all right we gotta hide all that they

[35:30] going to auto hide ribbon it ain't
[35:33] working
[35:42] whatever huh
[35:49] button on the bottom
[35:53] there you go ta-da you may be seated now
[36:00] man i'll tell you brother anderson is
[36:01] definitely not leaving again you
[36:03] watching them buddy you're no
[36:06] nope
[36:07] no those listen there's a lot to do back
[36:10] there
[36:10] and i really appreciate those guys
[36:15] because as i'm talk as i'm telling you
[36:16] as i told you before
[36:18] there's a lot of things they do back
[36:20] there and they really don't i love it
[36:21] when they can come out and sit in the
[36:22] atmosphere of the service because
[36:24] there's a lot of things they do back
[36:25] there that they miss a lot but you know
[36:26] what god will will give them grace
[36:30] amen just like i always think about
[36:32] sisters that have children
[36:34] uh you know you have to go in and out
[36:36] and you know talking to a sister not too
[36:38] long ago she said well my kids you know
[36:40] my kids go in and out and i can't hardly
[36:42] listen to everything god will make a
[36:43] provision if you want him to do that if
[36:45] you want him to give you more he'll give
[36:47] you more he'll help you to understand
[36:49] but you know what you're doing also what
[36:50] the bible says you're bearing children
[36:53] and you'll be saved in childbearing not
[36:55] because you had the kid but because you
[36:56] want to be in church with them because
[36:57] you want to take them to the house of
[36:59] god
[37:00] and you want the word of god to be what
[37:01] prevalent and a part of their life
[37:03] all right so let's just for just a
[37:05] minute we'll go through this and then
[37:07] we're going to get on faith because
[37:08] faith is the bottom of the pyramid and
[37:10] it's really wise so we're going to try
[37:11] to cover some things
[37:12] about faith
[37:14] that maybe you've not thought of before
[37:16] and trying to make it more simple
[37:18] because remember childlike faith is what
[37:20] we must have even to be born again even
[37:23] to be healed even to come to church you
[37:25] had to have childlike faith even to get
[37:27] in your car and crank the thing up
[37:28] that's faith all right
[37:30] but there's a measure of faith and they
[37:32] want to speak on that this afternoon a
[37:34] measure of faith all right but everybody
[37:36] look
[37:37] we as christians
[37:39] we as the bride of jesus christ we are
[37:41] predestinated to something we're
[37:43] predestinated to adoption
[37:45] all right and we've got we've got to
[37:47] come to that so we've got to have faith
[37:49] for that time luther didn't have to have
[37:52] faith for an adoption
[37:54] wesley didn't have to have faith for an
[37:56] adoption but you and i are going to have
[37:57] to have faith for an adoption i was
[38:00] watching uh this morning a brother
[38:02] online a message preacher just seeing
[38:05] what people are preaching on and
[38:07] you know he said well you know he said
[38:08] if the rapture takes place next sunday
[38:10] and i'm not here don't worry about it
[38:13] but listen we gotta quit doing that
[38:16] because you get the people to believe
[38:18] that if you don't show up that the
[38:20] raptures took place
[38:22] we got to have a resurrection first
[38:25] there's got to be a resurrection before
[38:27] you can even talk about a rapture
[38:30] there's got to be a resurrection and
[38:32] only bride will know about the
[38:33] resurrection then according to the
[38:35] prophet of god we'll be around 30-40
[38:37] days before the resurrection happens so
[38:40] let's get a resurrection here first
[38:42] let's start with each one of us having a
[38:44] resurrection in our heart that's what
[38:46] we've been trying to show you through
[38:48] justification and sanctification you
[38:50] ought to be able to walk this through
[38:51] your natural life
[38:54] and if you're not you're lost
[38:57] and it's okay to be lost
[39:00] it's okay
[39:01] but if you stay that way bob's been
[39:03] preaching on iniquity that's iniquity
[39:05] you sit in this church
[39:06] and you do things you're not supposed to
[39:08] do
[39:09] that's iniquity that's a hideous sin you
[39:11] know what you'll answer to god for it
[39:14] but remember your adoption's not your
[39:16] birth so we kind of ratcheted back a
[39:17] little bit and starting to talk about
[39:18] our birth
[39:21] because there's three stages as the baby
[39:23] comes there's three stages water blood
[39:25] and life there's three stages of
[39:27] adoption the first stage is the birth
[39:28] you've got to get the baby here
[39:30] that's what we were talking about last
[39:32] time we were preaching you got to get
[39:33] the baby here
[39:34] it doesn't matter it can be in the oven
[39:36] for nine months and that's not you know
[39:37] i i appreciate the
[39:40] uh roe versus wade i i we've always
[39:42] believed that
[39:44] hey man that that that you know life is
[39:46] life
[39:47] but we also know that brother brown told
[39:49] us that that baby was not a human being
[39:50] inside the womb
[39:52] he's not a human being or she until that
[39:54] baby is born smack and the spirit soul
[39:58] enters the baby all right
[40:00] so everybody with me on that all right
[40:02] so we're not political we're not worried
[40:03] about roe versus wade we know how to do
[40:05] it but you know what the people out in
[40:06] the world they are so they want to
[40:08] protest on this and they want to protest
[40:10] on that
[40:12] we just protest against the devil
[40:15] all right we're going to protest against
[40:16] the devil i want to make sure he knows i
[40:18] don't like him
[40:22] i don't like the things he makes me do
[40:25] because i help him
[40:27] hello
[40:29] we help him
[40:32] all the time
[40:33] but god's good all the time too
[40:36] let's read romans 8 says for as many are
[40:38] led by the spirit of god they are the
[40:39] sons of god so we're when we talk about
[40:41] this afternoon we talk about faith
[40:43] you're going to have you have to have
[40:45] you have to have a connection when you
[40:46] have faith
[40:48] you can't have faith in something you
[40:49] don't know even a little bit about
[40:52] you got to know a little bit of
[40:53] something to base all that on that's why
[40:55] the basis the base what is the base it's
[40:57] the foundation
[40:59] the base is
[41:00] faith the base is
[41:02] get born again start living a good
[41:05] christian life everybody wants to just
[41:06] jump up on top of the pyramid and sit
[41:08] down up there
[41:11] ain't it happening
[41:13] you didn't become an adult you started
[41:15] as a baby
[41:17] that all right
[41:18] for as many of those are led by the
[41:20] spirit of god
[41:22] they are the sons of god what do we have
[41:24] faith in the word of god
[41:27] that it will do what it said
[41:29] for you have not received the spirit of
[41:31] bondage again to fear listen if you're
[41:33] bound today just say god here's the
[41:36] confession
[41:38] i need you god to get me over this
[41:40] whatever put your you know put it inside
[41:42] your whatever your little box is
[41:44] i need to get over this
[41:46] all right i've not received the spirit
[41:49] of bondage against fear but you have
[41:50] received the spirit of adoption which
[41:52] puts you in the family of god
[41:54] by the new birth by being born again
[41:58] you're put into the family of god but
[42:00] you've not come to the adoption like it
[42:02] talks about in the bible
[42:04] the adoption in the bible is it's the
[42:06] son is born in the family
[42:09] and then he comes to a place and when he
[42:11] comes to a position when he has his
[42:13] schooling his schoolmaster his training
[42:16] his teaching then he comes to a place
[42:18] where the father says oh i can depend on
[42:20] him some now
[42:22] all right i can depend on him some now
[42:26] because remember full adoption is when
[42:28] our bodies changed
[42:29] everybody with me on that full adoption
[42:31] is when our bodies changed
[42:33] you can fully say we have been adopted
[42:35] we have made it
[42:36] we have been born again not being born
[42:39] again right
[42:42] because listen when we get to glory
[42:46] you're not going to need faith
[42:49] faith has given us here
[42:52] it's a substance of things hope for the
[42:54] evidence of things not seen
[42:56] but when we get to there we're going to
[42:58] see everything
[42:59] we're going to see every promise took
[43:01] care of you're going to see everything
[43:03] you lost took care of you're going to
[43:05] see all that restored back so what do
[43:07] you need faith for you needed faith to
[43:09] come to church but you don't have to
[43:10] need faith right now that you in church
[43:13] i'm talking about faith for the time
[43:16] because you're going to have to have
[43:17] faith that god's going to answer your
[43:19] prayer today so see there's another
[43:21] faith
[43:22] that you got to deal with and that's
[43:23] what we'll talk about this afternoon i
[43:24] keep wanting to go to it now but we'll
[43:26] we'll hold off we need to stay on them
[43:28] we need to get us to that place
[43:30] because see i read you a quote and if i
[43:31] don't read this quote again this morning
[43:33] then you'll be confused brother brown
[43:34] says faith alone won't do it
[43:39] but everything is based on faith
[43:42] well what's he saying there's a measure
[43:44] of faith you've got to come to
[43:46] right here then there's a measure of
[43:48] faith going to take you to virtue
[43:51] measure of faith knowledge and all these
[43:52] different things so we'll get to it in
[43:54] just a second but you have to receive
[43:56] the spirit of adoption whereby you cry
[43:58] and you know which father to cry to
[44:01] there was a father one time in the bible
[44:03] there was a man stood up and said you
[44:04] are of your father the
[44:06] devil amen
[44:09] but i know who my father is do you know
[44:12] who your father is we just come from
[44:13] father's day
[44:15] but we are the children of god or we are
[44:16] the progeny of god we are what god
[44:19] wanted to begin with all right and we're
[44:22] connected to god by dna spiritual dna
[44:25] not natural dna there's hardly anybody
[44:27] in this room that's that's that's tied
[44:29] together by natural dna unless it's your
[44:31] natural family but a lot of families
[44:33] sitting in here today all right but by
[44:35] the dna of god you and i everyone came
[44:37] from the same place
[44:40] amen
[44:41] by the new birth
[44:43] that we are the children of god
[44:46] and if children then heirs heirs of god
[44:48] and joint heirs with christ
[44:50] thank god we get what he got
[44:52] thank god we're going to be in a city
[44:55] that you made by your desire
[44:58] but god made it
[45:00] you know what
[45:01] you know how special that city is
[45:04] that future home
[45:07] that city that we're going to live in
[45:10] satan has never
[45:12] and will never
[45:14] enter the gates
[45:16] now in the millennium he's still alive
[45:19] in the millennium he raises back up
[45:20] comes back onto the earth he's in the
[45:23] earth now
[45:24] he's in you now in your spirit realm
[45:27] even if you're born again amen
[45:30] but they're in that future home oh when
[45:32] john saw that thing come down
[45:34] that's why the whole world's
[45:36] everybody's going he said it's finished
[45:38] it's over
[45:40] it's done
[45:41] satan will not ever be able to enter
[45:43] into those gates he'll never be able to
[45:45] trouble us
[45:46] but we listen but we got to get what
[45:49] we've got to get a piece of it right now
[45:51] you and i you are your piece of that
[45:54] future home
[45:55] god has preserved you in your soul today
[45:58] by the new birth without it you're lost
[46:02] but let's get born again let's realize
[46:05] that we're lost
[46:07] let's realize that if we don't put faith
[46:08] in god's word then we're we're
[46:10] unbelievers
[46:13] that we may be glorified together we
[46:15] must suffer with him suffer with him to
[46:17] reign is that what the scripture says we
[46:19] must suffer to reign with him
[46:22] because see faith and suffering goes
[46:24] together here we go again i'll get to it
[46:25] this afternoon justification
[46:29] well you need faith if you don't have
[46:30] any problems
[46:33] think about it that's why it's so
[46:35] glorious in that future home and even us
[46:36] with a glorified body we got to worry
[46:39] about one thing
[46:41] nothing
[46:44] we can't fathom it but by faith we
[46:46] believe it's already happening by faith
[46:49] we believe that
[46:51] so we go to justification listen
[46:53] justification is i have not read this
[46:56] before but brother brown said it is an
[46:57] act of the holy ghost
[46:59] because there's only one person that can
[47:01] justify you and that's jesus christ
[47:03] amen so it's an act of the holy ghost
[47:05] because we know jesus christ is the holy
[47:07] ghost too amen
[47:09] so being justified freely by his grace
[47:12] not yours
[47:14] through the redemption that is in christ
[47:16] jesus
[47:17] not yourself
[47:19] whom god has sent forth to be a
[47:21] perpetuation what through faith in his
[47:24] blood
[47:26] we'll talk about that this afternoon
[47:27] through faith
[47:28] to declare what your righteousness nada
[47:32] his righteousness but if i get myself in
[47:35] him i can declare his righteousness and
[47:38] that makes me righteous i'm just telling
[47:40] you what the bible says
[47:41] for the remissions of sins that are past
[47:44] we know that that's why that we don't
[47:46] like i said before we we don't pray and
[47:48] i'm sorry but it's a
[47:50] i heard it the other day on
[47:52] another sermon that uh brother was
[47:54] praying for sins in the future
[47:58] ain't happening
[47:59] can't happen
[48:01] you can't pray for sins in the future
[48:04] you've got to pray for sins that have
[48:05] passed
[48:06] amen
[48:07] listen in god he knows what you're going
[48:09] to do and yes he knows he's going to
[48:11] forgive you or not forgive you because
[48:13] he's already seen it but you and i don't
[48:16] you and i have to make a choice you and
[48:18] i have to make a decision
[48:21] so just let's just pray last night i
[48:24] didn't pray for my sins today
[48:26] i prayed for my sins i did before
[48:29] and got forgiveness because he said i'll
[48:31] forgive you if you'll ask
[48:35] but i promise you one thing
[48:38] if you ask frivolously or you ask just
[48:40] because you want something god knows
[48:42] that too
[48:44] god knows your heart
[48:46] that's the problem
[48:48] we can hide but you can't hide from god
[48:51] all right let's sanctification matthew
[48:53] 12 verse 43 says my unclean spirit has
[48:55] gone out of a man walks through dry
[48:57] places seek rest and findeth none then
[48:59] he said i will return him to my house
[49:01] from whence i came out and when he has
[49:03] come he finally said empty swept and
[49:05] garnished in other words the old thing
[49:06] you used to do you don't do them anymore
[49:08] i told y'all before i used to curse you
[49:10] you didn't smoke much but a drank
[49:13] just telling you my story
[49:16] and before i was even born again
[49:20] that was taken away
[49:23] the things i used to do
[49:25] i do them no more right
[49:28] but i was in sanctification because i
[49:30] had been taught by a wonderful pastor
[49:32] that be careful that's a good place to
[49:34] be god had to take those things away
[49:36] from me but if you don't get it filled
[49:37] with something satan's going to come
[49:38] back and fill it up with him
[49:41] he's going to what he's going to take
[49:43] back his house
[49:46] and you're going to be worse
[49:48] because you're going to think you got
[49:49] something you don't
[49:50] but you know what you will and i all of
[49:53] us
[49:54] will manifest who we are
[49:57] this is manifest in time you know what
[49:59] it's manifesting time for god and it's
[50:00] manifesting time for the devil all right
[50:02] then go ahead and take it with him seven
[50:04] other spirits more wicked than himself
[50:07] and they enter in and dwell there in the
[50:09] last state of that man is worse than the
[50:11] first
[50:12] the bible says if you can't stand
[50:13] correction you're what bible we were
[50:15] quoting this morning
[50:17] your bastard child if you can't take
[50:19] care of your family you're an infidel
[50:21] the bible says
[50:24] i'm just reading you the bible
[50:26] you all want to be church you don't want
[50:28] to be message believers but you don't
[50:29] want to read that part of the bible
[50:34] worse than an infidel
[50:38] if you can't take care of your house
[50:41] hmm
[50:42] i'm just telling you what bible as like
[50:44] brother dale said don't get mad at me
[50:46] read it in your bible
[50:49] oh we want to read about the seals and
[50:50] the plagues and the vials well you bury
[50:52] your born again first you'll never
[50:54] understand it's just words
[50:57] you know what paul said one time he said
[50:58] you can know all mystery
[51:02] all
[51:04] paul said you know all mysteries
[51:06] and not have charity or perfect love or
[51:09] the new birth you're a sounding brass
[51:12] and a tinkling symbol
[51:14] amen
[51:16] so now look the prophet of god tells us
[51:18] talks about we've been talking about
[51:19] this for months
[51:20] please i i know it's helping some
[51:25] but i know others are just and then
[51:26] you're not going to have it
[51:28] it's just not i i wish it was 100 but
[51:30] you know what
[51:32] it's not going to be that way
[51:34] but you know what we deal with it
[51:37] you deal with it
[51:38] he said he'd give you a new spirit now
[51:40] that spirit isn't god's spirit
[51:43] that's your spirit
[51:45] now listen he's not going to give you
[51:47] the same spirit you had before if you're
[51:49] really in sanctification he's going to
[51:50] give you a new spirit
[51:52] that's attached to your spirit that what
[51:55] is going to start shedding off this junk
[51:57] shedding off this stuff that you used to
[52:00] do
[52:01] sanctification this is not the new birth
[52:04] this is sanctification
[52:06] now that spirit isn't god's spirit
[52:08] that's your spirit god gives you a new
[52:10] spirit then he says i'll put my spirit
[52:12] in him oh that's a little bit different
[52:15] but the thing god has to do is give you
[52:17] a new spirit make your nature
[52:19] a little more gentle and settle down
[52:24] or he couldn't even live with you
[52:27] i want god to be comfortable living with
[52:28] me
[52:29] because i want him to live in me hey man
[52:33] so he has to get you fixed up first
[52:37] i like that has to get you fixed up
[52:39] first
[52:41] he gets you fixed up but you gotta allow
[52:43] him to fix you up
[52:46] then you take him anywhere
[52:48] you go all kinds of places get you fixed
[52:50] up so you can entertain him right how do
[52:52] you entertain god
[52:53] all he wants is your faith all he wants
[52:55] is the word is you to do what the word
[52:57] said
[52:58] amen
[52:59] we got to have an absolute we'll talk
[53:01] about it this afternoon you've got to
[53:02] have faith in the word of god nothing
[53:04] else
[53:05] faith's final resting place the prophet
[53:07] said is in the word of god
[53:09] all right so you take it all back to the
[53:11] word of god
[53:12] that's why that i'm gonna say it again
[53:15] if you don't if church is not a part of
[53:17] your life you're not born again
[53:21] i'm gonna read it tonight i got uh this
[53:23] afternoon brother brown talks about
[53:26] faith
[53:27] meet god on his ground he said oh i can
[53:30] meet him out
[53:31] he established one scripture that you
[53:34] can't get away from
[53:35] for satan not the assembling of himself
[53:37] together
[53:38] and brother brown said if you're born
[53:39] again you can't wait for the doors to
[53:40] open up all right
[53:44] but you know why it's not because to
[53:46] make you do something
[53:49] come on
[53:51] it's not to make you do something
[53:54] i love june she don't have to make me
[53:55] love her
[53:57] but if you fall in love with jesus
[53:58] christ you'll want to be here because
[53:59] you know what where two or three are
[54:01] gathered in his name he said that's
[54:02] where he'd be in the myth and he wants
[54:04] to sing worship songs and he wants to
[54:07] have the communion and he wants to have
[54:09] the foot washing and he wants to have
[54:10] the baptism and he wants to have us to
[54:12] worship together let the worshiper arise
[54:15] in other words bring that worship to him
[54:17] he he's worthy of that worship
[54:20] nothing else is worthy of worship except
[54:22] god amen nothing else
[54:25] the world is worshiping everything else
[54:27] you watch them they're so crazy every
[54:30] little something goes on that people
[54:31] rush to it
[54:32] this is the thing
[54:35] this is the thing
[54:36] and then when that don't stay long
[54:38] enough this is the thing
[54:43] you know
[54:44] our attention spans got smaller and
[54:46] smaller
[54:49] remember that article somebody read a
[54:50] long time ago that now that movie
[54:52] producers
[54:54] used to you had to have you would have
[54:55] an exciting scene every 15 minutes and
[54:57] it would hold your attention now you
[54:59] have to have an ex exciting scene every
[55:01] two minutes
[55:03] to keep you excited to keep your goat
[55:05] well guess what
[55:06] if you're not excited about god
[55:09] he's not going to give you 15 minutes
[55:14] amen
[55:15] we're made to worship
[55:18] so that's when you're on the first altar
[55:19] but when you hide away you get his
[55:21] spirit
[55:22] then the holy spirit none other than god
[55:24] himself
[55:26] comes and dwells in you
[55:28] and then there's something about you the
[55:29] neighbor loves you the people likes you
[55:32] let's look at the baptism of the holy
[55:33] ghost real quick
[55:35] peter says seeing you have purified look
[55:37] you have purified your soul
[55:41] so you do have something to do with it
[55:44] you can sit today and just close it all
[55:46] off and just die and go to hell
[55:48] or you can open up and say god i gotta
[55:50] issue i got a problem i got something i
[55:52] need to work on
[55:53] god help me do this seeing you have
[55:54] purified your souls and what obeying the
[55:57] truth yes
[55:59] obeying the truth through the spirit
[56:02] unto unfeigned love
[56:04] of the brethren
[56:06] an unfeigned love of the brethren
[56:07] doesn't mean what you think is not
[56:09] that's not
[56:10] filial love
[56:12] that's agape love
[56:16] see that you love one another with a
[56:18] pure heart fervently
[56:22] fervently
[56:24] why
[56:25] if you don't you won't get born again
[56:27] because that's paul b now peter says
[56:30] being born again not a corruptible seed
[56:32] you were born of that the first time
[56:35] but of incorruptible seed by the what by
[56:37] the word of god
[56:39] which liveth and abideth forever for all
[56:41] fleshes is grass and the glory of man's
[56:43] the flower of grass the grass withered
[56:45] and the flower therefore falls away but
[56:47] the word of god enjoy forever
[56:50] and this is the word which by the gospel
[56:52] is preached unto you
[56:54] for all the years
[56:56] this gospel has been preached
[56:58] it's going to come to a day of fruition
[57:00] it's going to come to a day that you're
[57:02] going to have to manifest exactly who
[57:04] you are
[57:05] you're going to know who you are
[57:09] and there'll be a time when they can't
[57:10] do nothing about it
[57:12] and you know what i want i want that
[57:14] time to to come where i'm so full of god
[57:17] i don't have nothing to do with it
[57:20] oh you were thought i was going to say
[57:21] the other way didn't you all thinking i
[57:23] was going to say yeah we're going to
[57:24] manifest yeah you are but i want to be
[57:26] so full of god
[57:29] so i can't get away from it
[57:31] so there's something happens all the
[57:32] time brother brown talks it he said it'd
[57:34] be like
[57:35] fireworks
[57:36] like popping popcorn pop pop pop pop
[57:39] it's what's gonna happen to the church i
[57:41] know we're sitting here sometimes you're
[57:43] like well this is they're not boring but
[57:45] you know this is just something we've
[57:46] been over and been through but everybody
[57:48] gets a piece of something
[57:51] all right
[57:52] the dispensation of the fullness of
[57:54] times which is right now he might gather
[57:56] together i think that's what he's doing
[57:57] he's gathering us together we used to
[57:59] sing a long time ago we are gathering
[58:01] together unto him amen he might gather
[58:04] together in one all things in christ
[58:07] both which are in heaven and which are
[58:08] on earth
[58:09] even in him and also we have obtained an
[58:12] inheritance being predestinated
[58:15] according to the purpose of him he
[58:16] worketh all things after the council of
[58:18] his will what is his will his will is
[58:19] his word
[58:20] all right we've come today to listen to
[58:22] the
[58:24] what
[58:25] reading of the will
[58:27] somebody died
[58:29] my daddy died
[58:33] and when my father died he left me
[58:34] something
[58:36] and i've come today to get what i
[58:39] see in the will
[58:41] that's why prophet god said his will is
[58:42] his word
[58:44] how do you want to know what god gives
[58:45] you read the bible
[58:47] healing faith all these different
[58:49] miracles and all the different just read
[58:50] it
[58:52] that we should be to the praise of his
[58:53] glory who first trusted in christ and
[58:55] him also you trusted look after you
[58:57] heard the word of truth listen you had
[58:59] like i said i'm gonna talk about this
[59:01] afternoon but you can't have faith in
[59:03] the word of god if you never read it
[59:06] if you never read it what are you gonna
[59:07] have faith in
[59:10] well i got faith faith for what
[59:13] faith that god will do what he said in
[59:15] his will
[59:16] everybody with me and him also you
[59:19] trusted look you didn't trust him before
[59:23] in whom you also trusted after
[59:26] that you heard the word of truth the
[59:28] gospel of your salvation and whom also
[59:31] what after that you believed
[59:33] there's your faith faith in believing
[59:36] after that you believed you were sealed
[59:38] with that holy spirit of promise
[59:40] the holy ghost the baptism of the holy
[59:41] ghost which is the what earnest of your
[59:43] inheritance until the redemption of the
[59:45] purchased possession in other words
[59:47] until everything is possessed listen
[59:50] the world is possessed
[59:53] with a devil
[59:55] but i won't be possessed with god
[59:58] that possess you know why it means that
[1:00:00] something comes in and resides there and
[1:00:02] you either like it or don't like it the
[1:00:04] world is possessed by the devil you and
[1:00:06] i should be possessed by god because we
[1:00:08] are what his possession
[1:00:10] purchased possession we are his purchase
[1:00:13] he purchased our sins at calvary went to
[1:00:16] hell to pay for my sins
[1:00:17] hung on a cross
[1:00:19] to pay for my sins
[1:00:21] but that's the earnest of our
[1:00:22] inheritance
[1:00:25] in other words it's a earnest of the key
[1:00:27] to that city
[1:00:30] but then once you open the door you got
[1:00:32] the full benefits of that city
[1:00:35] city built four square
[1:00:38] satan will never put his grubby feet in
[1:00:39] that thing
[1:00:41] oh that may ought to make you feel good
[1:00:44] there's one place satan will not be
[1:00:47] he will not be
[1:00:48] in that new city
[1:00:51] unto the praise of his glory john 14 25
[1:00:54] these things have i spoken unto you what
[1:00:55] being yet present with you but the
[1:00:56] comforter
[1:00:58] which is the holy ghost
[1:00:59] whom the father will send in my name he
[1:01:01] shall teach you all things
[1:01:03] and bring all things to your remembrance
[1:01:05] whatsoever i have said unto you remember
[1:01:08] we were talking about i believe it's in
[1:01:09] galatians where we're given school we're
[1:01:10] giving teachers
[1:01:12] schoolmasters to bring us to christ but
[1:01:14] after that it's not that we don't need
[1:01:16] those teaching anymore we need the real
[1:01:18] teachers which is good but you build
[1:01:21] your foundation listen your first grade
[1:01:23] teacher i remember ever i remember the
[1:01:25] first grade teacher
[1:01:27] that was kind of special because she was
[1:01:28] the one that you know you she took care
[1:01:30] of you and you were just a young kid and
[1:01:31] you didn't know what you were doing and
[1:01:33] where you were going and she kind of
[1:01:34] nurtured you around and and
[1:01:37] and helped you get started in school
[1:01:40] all right everybody with me on this
[1:01:41] that's the same way god is
[1:01:43] he sends the holy ghost to get you in
[1:01:45] the right building make sure you write
[1:01:46] you make sure you bring the right stuff
[1:01:49] right book make sure you're in the right
[1:01:51] place and that but now look that first
[1:01:54] grade teacher as much as you love her
[1:01:57] she's not going to the second grade with
[1:01:58] you
[1:02:01] you're getting a new teacher
[1:02:03] and that teacher teaches you through
[1:02:05] that grade
[1:02:06] but she doesn't follow you now look you
[1:02:08] know what follows you
[1:02:10] your mind what you thought of that first
[1:02:12] because see i remember my first grade
[1:02:14] teacher probably some of you do some of
[1:02:15] you probably a little bit older they
[1:02:16] can't remember that far back
[1:02:18] but that's okay you had one
[1:02:23] and everybody loves miss roberts where's
[1:02:25] hannah
[1:02:26] way in the back everybody and i got
[1:02:28] people now on my mail route that's well
[1:02:30] i'm gonna tell them how old they are
[1:02:31] because she taught them in school a
[1:02:33] bunch of years ago they're already
[1:02:34] adults
[1:02:35] with kids
[1:02:37] and they said oh we know miss robert she
[1:02:39] was our kindergarten teacher for my kid
[1:02:42] well see there there's an impression
[1:02:43] what they carried the impression with
[1:02:45] them but they didn't carry anna's anna
[1:02:47] wasn't set up in the 12th grade going
[1:02:49] all right come on now you go to that
[1:02:51] room right over there and you make sure
[1:02:54] go to the bathroom before you come into
[1:02:55] sanctuary
[1:02:57] i thought i'd put that one in there
[1:03:00] the teacher ought to teach you that
[1:03:03] we can sit for three hours and watch
[1:03:05] and watch going with the wind
[1:03:11] and never pee a drop
[1:03:14] not even think about it
[1:03:17] come on somebody
[1:03:19] we can sit watch a ball game football
[1:03:21] game you go to mess you're going to miss
[1:03:22] a play
[1:03:23] okay i'll just sit here
[1:03:27] but church
[1:03:29] you feel a little a little wiggled down
[1:03:31] there you know like your bladder is
[1:03:32] starting to fill up you go
[1:03:35] i know we have issues but you know what
[1:03:37] they make depends
[1:03:42] there is a way to not disturb the
[1:03:45] service
[1:03:48] some of y'all's kids got bladder about
[1:03:50] that size right there
[1:03:55] but you see them go play outside for two
[1:03:56] hours between services and they never go
[1:03:58] to the bathroom
[1:04:00] i just thought i'd throw at them in
[1:04:02] there
[1:04:04] but you know what god sees that he sees
[1:04:06] the effort you do make and the effort
[1:04:08] you don't make
[1:04:10] amen
[1:04:11] mama always made us she's i said mom i
[1:04:13] don't have to go to the bathroom go in
[1:04:14] and squeeze
[1:04:19] right mom go ahead go ahead you don't
[1:04:20] have to go in and squeeze
[1:04:24] you're not getting up when church starts
[1:04:26] you're not getting up during service we
[1:04:27] knew better than do that
[1:04:29] mom
[1:04:30] we
[1:04:31] she pinched these oh
[1:04:34] make more noise pensioners than it would
[1:04:35] anything else
[1:04:38] but you know what we learned a lesson
[1:04:41] go to the bathroom before we go
[1:04:43] in service
[1:04:45] well brother brown said what
[1:04:47] parental delinquency
[1:04:49] not kids
[1:04:52] i hear that i hear maybe i hear the kids
[1:04:54] say it man but i didn't hear many adults
[1:04:55] saying man on that
[1:04:59] let's continue on these things have i
[1:05:00] spoken unto you being yet present with
[1:05:02] you but the comforter which is the holy
[1:05:04] ghost see why he's going to be with you
[1:05:06] now see anna the teaching that anna had
[1:05:09] went with those people
[1:05:12] and they remember that but they didn't
[1:05:14] say i need to go back you can't go back
[1:05:17] in god
[1:05:19] you can't do that
[1:05:22] now listen if you backslide your back
[1:05:24] slid away from god now god's going to
[1:05:25] come get you if you're a child of his
[1:05:27] right
[1:05:28] but if you're not then he is not
[1:05:30] obligated to come back and get you
[1:05:32] amen he never went and got a child
[1:05:35] children of israel when they scattered
[1:05:37] he never he told him he said we're going
[1:05:39] in this direction you're going to the
[1:05:40] promised land all those went over here
[1:05:42] and married this one they went over
[1:05:43] married to moabites and went married
[1:05:44] this one that the other guy didn't go
[1:05:45] there and get them
[1:05:47] he gave him a choice he said you got to
[1:05:48] come back here all right that's the same
[1:05:50] way with us we've got to come back to
[1:05:52] the word of god
[1:05:54] whom the father will send in my name he
[1:05:56] shall teach you all things and bring all
[1:05:58] things to your remembrance what the
[1:06:00] first great teacher told you everybody
[1:06:02] with me on that
[1:06:03] or the second grader the third grade i
[1:06:05] had a wonderful math teacher that's why
[1:06:07] i love math doc sis he made it he wanted
[1:06:09] a doctor
[1:06:10] but his name's doc seth and now he
[1:06:12] taught most of us that went to banks
[1:06:14] county but he was a super good teacher
[1:06:16] because he taught
[1:06:18] oh he was tough
[1:06:20] i had another girl named flunkin duncan
[1:06:22] she was in my grade she was with me in
[1:06:24] school
[1:06:26] she was rough they called her flunk and
[1:06:28] duncan
[1:06:29] if you didn't make the grade there
[1:06:30] wasn't no gray area i wish she was a
[1:06:32] christian she'd be a good one
[1:06:34] maybe god will save her
[1:06:36] but she was so adamant about you
[1:06:38] studying so adamant about you getting
[1:06:40] what she said in school
[1:06:42] so she would flunk you and it didn't
[1:06:43] matter
[1:06:44] but you know what she couldn't
[1:06:46] listen she didn't flunk a person that
[1:06:48] made 80s
[1:06:50] she flunked the one that made 60s
[1:06:53] that didn't care they didn't want to do
[1:06:55] it
[1:06:56] she and god's going to do that too he's
[1:06:58] not going to flunk you because you're in
[1:06:59] the 60s
[1:07:01] he's going to flunk you because you know
[1:07:02] what to do and you don't do it
[1:07:05] are you doing something wrong that
[1:07:06] you're not supposed to do
[1:07:08] and god's going to punish us if we're
[1:07:10] children if not we're just bastard
[1:07:11] children just like i said before if god
[1:07:14] doesn't correct us
[1:07:16] we're gone
[1:07:18] thank god for correction
[1:07:21] thank god for the chicken house
[1:07:23] opportunities like terrance does about
[1:07:24] every two times a week
[1:07:28] when daddy said let's go to the chicken
[1:07:29] house we're in trouble and ain't gonna
[1:07:30] see the chickens i promise you that
[1:07:32] cause there ain't no chickens in that
[1:07:33] chicken house
[1:07:36] so anyway he knows what i'm talking
[1:07:38] about and i don't know a thing about
[1:07:39] what we're talking about but
[1:07:45] acts 1 verse 4
[1:07:46] and being assembled together with them
[1:07:48] but listen christianity can be molded
[1:07:50] with your life
[1:07:52] it is your life
[1:07:54] christianity or not being a christian
[1:07:56] it's molded in your life it's molded in
[1:07:59] your character and you can't get away
[1:08:00] from it that's why i love brother
[1:08:02] branham was a wonderful storyteller who
[1:08:05] was he telling most of his stories on
[1:08:07] his
[1:08:08] self good and bad
[1:08:11] amen he tell a story about about tying
[1:08:14] the string remember he had a temper oh
[1:08:16] prophet
[1:08:17] oh my god
[1:08:19] yeah he wasn't born again
[1:08:20] for those of you that don't believe that
[1:08:24] remember he said he'd tie that string he
[1:08:26] said the teacher
[1:08:28] told him to tie that string around and
[1:08:30] you know what is it tie ten knots or
[1:08:32] something or we used to say it was what
[1:08:34] count to sin
[1:08:35] brother brown i'm gonna go once leave
[1:08:36] her and he said i thought thing down and
[1:08:37] well when
[1:08:40] and your prophet would have been a
[1:08:41] murderer if it hadn't been for god
[1:08:44] your prophet would have been a suicide
[1:08:46] victim if it had not been for god
[1:08:52] because he told the story
[1:08:55] he didn't let his life be a secret he
[1:08:57] let his life be an open book i thank god
[1:08:59] brother claude brother claude said one
[1:09:01] time he said he said i'm glad you know
[1:09:03] brother brown said i can't keep in other
[1:09:05] words you can't keep a secret
[1:09:08] that's why he was built to give it to us
[1:09:10] he can't keep a secret from god the
[1:09:13] things he did keep secret he said it's
[1:09:15] for me and god
[1:09:17] but thank god he couldn't keep that
[1:09:18] secret that that he tried to shoot them
[1:09:20] kids
[1:09:22] with a 22 rifle and the bullets wouldn't
[1:09:23] go off
[1:09:24] now that he was up on a wire we think
[1:09:26] we're in trouble we think we got
[1:09:28] problems i'm going to preach a little
[1:09:29] bit
[1:09:31] here he is on a on a wire
[1:09:34] 16 feet up a pole
[1:09:36] 200 000 volts running across the top of
[1:09:38] him god had just listen god took his
[1:09:41] children
[1:09:42] his child because god told him he said
[1:09:44] this is happening because you didn't do
[1:09:46] what i told you to do
[1:09:48] am i all right
[1:09:50] so he lost his wife
[1:09:51] his baby died
[1:09:53] and he said god i'm done
[1:09:56] throw it off that glove and he said he
[1:09:58] reached to get the wire
[1:10:02] and he woke up down laying on the ground
[1:10:06] tried to commit suicide
[1:10:09] because his humanity had took over
[1:10:14] same way with the
[1:10:15] kids
[1:10:17] he was going to kill those kids
[1:10:19] and being a crack shot you know what
[1:10:21] he'd killed every one of them
[1:10:24] but god saved him
[1:10:26] god preserved him
[1:10:29] but he also didn't let him keep it
[1:10:30] secret
[1:10:31] he gave it so that he could tell me in
[1:10:33] you
[1:10:34] how that the saving grace of god
[1:10:36] as long as he
[1:10:38] is he see god knew i gotta what do you
[1:10:40] tell what you tell brother brown he said
[1:10:41] don't smoke drink curse and all this
[1:10:43] stuff cause i have a work for you later
[1:10:47] because remember at twenty-something
[1:10:48] years old remember brother brown said
[1:10:50] i'd be washing my car on sunday just so
[1:10:52] i didn't go to church i'd watch them
[1:10:53] church folks go to church oh the prophet
[1:10:56] of god
[1:10:57] that was already seeing vision saw his
[1:10:59] first vision at six years old
[1:11:01] absolutely knew there was something in
[1:11:03] his life that was following him
[1:11:05] absolutely i believe had a gift then but
[1:11:07] you know what didn't know how to use it
[1:11:11] so god didn't give him the keys
[1:11:13] same way with this adoption god's not
[1:11:14] gonna give you the keys if you're a baby
[1:11:17] but when brother brown grew up got the
[1:11:19] new birth oh that's hard for people to
[1:11:21] believe
[1:11:22] got the new birth he went through
[1:11:23] justifications how can he preach on it
[1:11:26] if he didn't go through it
[1:11:28] he couldn't preach it this is not some
[1:11:30] mystical thing that brother brown said
[1:11:32] i'll just get it from god and i ain't
[1:11:34] gonna have to worry about living it oh
[1:11:40] same way with us
[1:11:44] we had a prophet that number one he was
[1:11:46] a human
[1:11:47] he was a human being
[1:11:50] he had issues
[1:11:53] but you know what
[1:11:55] you don't hear him after he was born
[1:11:56] again
[1:11:57] you don't hear him having those same
[1:11:58] issues he didn't want to kill himself in
[1:12:00] the 50s and the 60s
[1:12:02] it was when he'd done something wrong
[1:12:04] amen
[1:12:06] so let's keep that in mind when we do
[1:12:07] something wrong we're going to get
[1:12:08] whipped
[1:12:09] we're going to get spanked
[1:12:11] but thank god for the spanking because
[1:12:12] you know what only my dad is going to
[1:12:13] spank me or my schoolmaster
[1:12:16] all right
[1:12:18] now
[1:12:18] sorry but when we grew up
[1:12:21] my daddy mama told the neighbor if we
[1:12:22] did something wrong with him
[1:12:25] try that today
[1:12:28] y'all be calling me going can you get me
[1:12:30] out of forsyth county jail
[1:12:34] man but one of y'all living for south
[1:12:36] county
[1:12:38] bob
[1:12:40] i listen for south county just came to
[1:12:42] my mind okay could have said hall county
[1:12:44] and it would have covered a lot more of
[1:12:45] you but since the forsyth county it
[1:12:47] covered bob and his face is red and
[1:12:51] and that gray is shining more than it is
[1:12:53] when that bottle hits all that his
[1:12:54] daughter made him
[1:12:56] inside joke and being assembled together
[1:12:58] with them commanded them that they
[1:12:59] should not depart from jerusalem he's
[1:13:01] telling them what to do
[1:13:03] where to go to get this what's coming
[1:13:07] everybody with me
[1:13:09] this is acts
[1:13:10] the holy ghost is getting ready to fall
[1:13:13] being sent assembled together command to
[1:13:14] them that they should not depart from
[1:13:16] jerusalem but wait for the promise of
[1:13:17] the father wait
[1:13:20] go to jerusalem
[1:13:22] and wait until you're endued with power
[1:13:24] from on high you know what out of 500
[1:13:27] people only 120 did it
[1:13:31] because he was seen at 500 brethren
[1:13:34] right
[1:13:35] 380 of them did not go what he did not
[1:13:39] do everything he told them to do
[1:13:41] these 120 dead they said all right let's
[1:13:44] go for john truly baptized with water
[1:13:47] but you shall be baptized with the holy
[1:13:49] ghost not many days hence
[1:13:51] when they therefore come together they
[1:13:53] ask of him saying lord without see
[1:13:56] then have the new birth
[1:13:58] they think he's going to restore destroy
[1:13:59] the kingdom on the earth
[1:14:01] without the new birth we ask the same
[1:14:03] questions don't be silly we ask silly
[1:14:04] questions when we're not born again
[1:14:06] and he said unto them it is not for you
[1:14:08] to know
[1:14:09] the times of the seasons which the
[1:14:11] father have put in his own power but you
[1:14:13] shall receive power
[1:14:15] or dunamis
[1:14:17] after the after
[1:14:21] that's why brother brown says that the
[1:14:23] church the church nominal it's cold
[1:14:27] formal and powerless
[1:14:30] without the holy ghost you're powerless
[1:14:32] you say we've got signs and wonders
[1:14:34] we've got this
[1:14:35] that's gifts of god
[1:14:37] you can have gifts of god without having
[1:14:38] the new birth
[1:14:41] hmm
[1:14:42] amen
[1:14:44] but look
[1:14:45] here's what's going to seal the deal and
[1:14:47] ye shall be witnesses
[1:14:50] unto me
[1:14:53] to
[1:14:54] god
[1:14:56] both in jerusalem and all judea and
[1:14:58] samaria and look we are sitting today
[1:15:00] lula georgia is in the uttermost part of
[1:15:02] the earth
[1:15:04] all right so that dunamis means power
[1:15:06] mighty work strength miracles virtue
[1:15:09] strength power and ability inherent
[1:15:11] power did we just not say that you
[1:15:13] receive an inheritance yes
[1:15:16] your inheritance is power
[1:15:19] power over these things that listen like
[1:15:21] i said before your bills are not going
[1:15:23] to quit coming your car's not going to
[1:15:26] act up sister rebecca
[1:15:28] it's going to happen it's just things of
[1:15:30] life
[1:15:32] but you'll know how to handle them
[1:15:35] that's what we'll talk about this
[1:15:36] afternoon faith will teach you how to
[1:15:38] handle things if you'll just look at
[1:15:41] faith
[1:15:42] not the circumstances
[1:15:46] brother branham said this
[1:15:47] i'll read it this afternoon well no i'm
[1:15:49] going to save it he said he said if you
[1:15:52] say i'm a christian in a service
[1:15:55] he said but when you go home you say i'm
[1:15:57] not a christian he said you lose
[1:16:00] that
[1:16:01] confession you had
[1:16:05] i'll read it
[1:16:06] we believe brother brown was a prophet
[1:16:09] because he can only go by your
[1:16:10] confession
[1:16:14] inherent power
[1:16:16] power residing
[1:16:18] not on a thing anything
[1:16:21] in a thing you are the thing
[1:16:24] because the holy ghost is not in that
[1:16:26] drums
[1:16:28] someone with the holy ghost plays the
[1:16:30] drums
[1:16:33] but that's just drums
[1:16:36] like brother brown said he said it's not
[1:16:38] the
[1:16:39] mountain was holy
[1:16:41] he said it was a god on the mountain
[1:16:42] that was holy
[1:16:43] it's not that you and i are holy it's
[1:16:45] the god inside of us that makes us holy
[1:16:48] inherent power power residing in a thing
[1:16:49] by virtue what of its nature
[1:16:51] now there's a power natural power we'll
[1:16:53] talk about this afternoon there's a
[1:16:54] natural faith
[1:16:57] and we'll use some examples
[1:16:58] there's people that have faith out in
[1:17:00] the world that are just total
[1:17:04] whatever you want to call them
[1:17:05] lost
[1:17:07] all right
[1:17:08] people have
[1:17:09] faith
[1:17:10] carl wallenda
[1:17:12] everybody knows who that is
[1:17:14] well the younger people don't well
[1:17:16] freedom you know okay
[1:17:17] he was a high wire
[1:17:20] trapeze artist
[1:17:21] and he went across buildings you know
[1:17:23] hundreds of feet across buildings he
[1:17:25] actually come up here in toccoa and did
[1:17:27] it i mean
[1:17:28] high wire okay high wire he actually did
[1:17:30] it up here at the little gorge he walked
[1:17:32] across the gorge back in the 70s or
[1:17:34] something
[1:17:35] he walked on a one-inch wire
[1:17:39] at hundreds of feet high
[1:17:42] that takes faith
[1:17:45] i'm thinking about it ain't getting
[1:17:47] dizzy
[1:17:49] but he just went like
[1:17:52] took a chair with him and set the chair
[1:17:54] on that thing and sat down in the chair
[1:17:58] that takes faith but you know what his
[1:18:00] faith ended one day
[1:18:02] your faith won't
[1:18:04] but his faith ended one day because he
[1:18:06] had faith he said oh i'm not going to
[1:18:08] worry about this 10 mile an hour wind
[1:18:09] well you know what it come a 20 mile an
[1:18:11] hour wind and knocked him off and he
[1:18:13] fell to his death at about 150 feet
[1:18:16] but he had faith to do what he was doing
[1:18:18] that's just natural faith
[1:18:20] but the faith in god will never let you
[1:18:22] do that if you have faith that you're
[1:18:24] gonna make it you'll make it
[1:18:26] if you don't you won't
[1:18:30] power for performing miracles
[1:18:33] moral power and excellence of soul
[1:18:36] you know what carl juan linda they say
[1:18:38] he practiced every day
[1:18:40] he was 74 when he died
[1:18:44] when he fell off that building somewhere
[1:18:45] in las vegas or somewhere he should have
[1:18:46] been in las vegas
[1:18:50] sister rachel said amen
[1:18:54] you know what he done
[1:18:57] he took he he got out there and he got
[1:18:59] into circumstances they said the wire
[1:19:00] started doing this and he couldn't
[1:19:01] control it
[1:19:03] and he fell to his death
[1:19:04] but at 74 years old they said he
[1:19:06] practiced all the time
[1:19:08] i mean he was walking on something he
[1:19:09] was walking on something about that size
[1:19:13] it's hard for us to get up and walk on
[1:19:14] the floor
[1:19:17] but you know what he had faith something
[1:19:18] to he overcame a human ability that me
[1:19:21] you and me i mean i can get 20 30 feet
[1:19:23] in air deer hunting but uh not no 300
[1:19:26] feet or 200 feet no
[1:19:28] i don't have that kind of faith
[1:19:30] listen i'm not required the bible says
[1:19:32] lord i'll be with you always
[1:19:35] you'll get that in a minute
[1:19:37] knowing brethren beloved aaron said yeah
[1:19:40] knowing brethren beloved your election
[1:19:42] of god
[1:19:44] for our gospel came not unto you in word
[1:19:46] only look not in word only
[1:19:49] it's not going to be listen we've got
[1:19:51] the mechanics
[1:19:55] we need the dynamics
[1:19:58] listen the world has got mechanics
[1:20:02] the world has mechanics
[1:20:06] what is mechanics
[1:20:07] what's in a book
[1:20:13] see their dynamics is going to be of
[1:20:14] satan
[1:20:16] our dynamics is going to be of god
[1:20:18] for our gospel came not unto you in word
[1:20:20] only but also in power
[1:20:22] and in the holy ghost
[1:20:24] and look and in much assurance
[1:20:29] much assurance not a little bit of
[1:20:31] assurance
[1:20:32] when i told you about the 19 he always
[1:20:34] got baptized please
[1:20:36] please don't quit
[1:20:38] you can't quit
[1:20:40] you got to keep going
[1:20:42] look you got to have faith
[1:20:47] for our gospel came not only the word
[1:20:49] only but also in power and in the holy
[1:20:51] ghost and what any much assurance
[1:20:53] as you know
[1:20:55] what manner of men we were among you for
[1:20:58] your sake and you became followers of us
[1:21:02] they didn't become followers of peter
[1:21:03] and paul a different one they were
[1:21:05] followers of the holy ghost that was
[1:21:06] inside of them
[1:21:09] listen there's an anointing that goes
[1:21:11] with that power
[1:21:12] there's an anointing that goes that
[1:21:14] brother branham tells us i was talking
[1:21:15] about this to myself this morning
[1:21:17] yesterday morning
[1:21:18] y'all don't ever do that
[1:21:21] i have the most intelligent conversation
[1:21:22] between me myself and i
[1:21:24] all three of us that trinity
[1:21:33] but you know what
[1:21:35] there's a power
[1:21:38] that you can create an atmosphere
[1:21:40] and brother brown said money
[1:21:42] women in popularity a preacher better
[1:21:44] watch out for
[1:21:46] money
[1:21:49] women in popularity you know why
[1:21:51] i'm not going to scare y'all i'm going
[1:21:52] to look see if this thing's working
[1:21:55] i'm sweating too
[1:21:56] it's on 78 degrees
[1:21:58] you don't not be 78 here aaron
[1:22:02] so i'm going to override it you hear
[1:22:04] that what a blessed noise
[1:22:06] what a blessed noise
[1:22:08] we're going to hold it right there all
[1:22:10] right fix it when you get done there
[1:22:11] it's your job
[1:22:14] so money women in popularity but that
[1:22:17] goes with a minister because you know
[1:22:18] what a minister is doing
[1:22:20] he's not pulling for your money you
[1:22:22] understand what i'm saying but there's a
[1:22:24] poll there why do you think these
[1:22:27] i'm going to say it anyway people like
[1:22:28] jesse duplantis he tells his
[1:22:30] congregation i need 200 million for a
[1:22:32] new airplane so i can get to my
[1:22:33] believers faster
[1:22:36] and he got it
[1:22:39] because there was a power of a pull well
[1:22:42] if he's a man of god he needs this
[1:22:46] and women that's what i told you before
[1:22:49] ministers young ministers i've watched
[1:22:50] for brother dale you keep yourself away
[1:22:52] from a woman
[1:22:56] there's a pull
[1:22:57] because you know what you're doing now
[1:22:59] i'm going to say this plain you're
[1:23:00] spiritually making love to the bride of
[1:23:02] jesus christ through christ is through
[1:23:04] you preaching the gospel
[1:23:07] the seed is falling
[1:23:09] and your what your conception has been
[1:23:11] it's just like that so you have to be
[1:23:14] careful
[1:23:15] and popularity what's popularity
[1:23:18] me gotta listen to me
[1:23:21] god come to me to get this
[1:23:24] and you know what they do they flock by
[1:23:26] millions
[1:23:27] millions of followers
[1:23:28] i'm like me and bob were talking about
[1:23:30] the other day you look on these some of
[1:23:31] these places and you you see that
[1:23:33] immediately a preacher puts up a
[1:23:36] a
[1:23:36] a sermon and they get 4 000 views
[1:23:39] we hardly get four
[1:23:42] well maybe 40
[1:23:44] or 50.
[1:23:45] 100 if it's a good title
[1:23:51] and the longer the title well anyway
[1:23:54] but you see what they're doing
[1:23:58] it's a pull
[1:24:00] sheep needs a shepherd
[1:24:04] even though nominal christians even
[1:24:05] though they're not born in they need
[1:24:06] somebody to tell them what to do
[1:24:09] the world's not doing it politics is not
[1:24:11] doing it they need somebody so there's
[1:24:13] millions of views you know this preacher
[1:24:15] and i'm not talking about message breach
[1:24:16] i'm talking about you know oh well i
[1:24:17] like my beekeeper friend brother brother
[1:24:20] don cookie monster i guess i could call
[1:24:22] him brother
[1:24:24] he can walk out in his bee yard
[1:24:27] and say my bees are flying today he gets
[1:24:29] 45 000 views
[1:24:33] 20 second little snippet
[1:24:37] but the world is looking for information
[1:24:40] why are we not looking for information
[1:24:42] when there's only 100 and some views
[1:24:43] coming from this church
[1:24:46] for sermons
[1:24:47] there's almost that many people sitting
[1:24:49] here today
[1:24:51] just saying
[1:24:52] the world don't want everything they
[1:24:54] just want parts they just want to go so
[1:24:55] far
[1:24:57] and they don't want to go all the way
[1:24:58] you and i faith will take us all the way
[1:25:02] faith is a vehicle that's going to take
[1:25:04] us where we need to go
[1:25:05] all right
[1:25:07] but you've got to have a little bit of
[1:25:08] faith in yourself
[1:25:11] i know we put all of our faith in god
[1:25:12] but brother brian i'm going to read you
[1:25:14] a quote where brother brown says god
[1:25:15] will never save you if you don't let him
[1:25:18] he'll never heal you if you don't let
[1:25:19] him
[1:25:20] because he's already healed us everyone
[1:25:22] in calvary two thousand twenty two
[1:25:24] hundred years ago
[1:25:25] and what we're still dying
[1:25:29] now when god is silent we better be
[1:25:31] silent
[1:25:33] where he's spoken we'd better speak to
[1:25:35] and say what he already said
[1:25:38] he told he told us the evidence or what
[1:25:41] would happen after being baptized with
[1:25:43] the holy ghost that we would have the
[1:25:45] teacher come and teach us all truth but
[1:25:48] that teacher was an inside teacher
[1:25:51] not an outside teacher well brother way
[1:25:53] then we don't have to go to church we
[1:25:55] don't have to listen to a teacher that's
[1:25:56] not what he's saying
[1:25:58] he's saying you got to have that
[1:25:59] teaching
[1:26:00] and then it will agree with the and the
[1:26:02] inside teacher is going to say give me
[1:26:03] more
[1:26:05] give me more
[1:26:06] the inside teacher will tell you to go
[1:26:08] to church
[1:26:10] look he can't deny his word
[1:26:13] there's no way he can deny his word
[1:26:15] that's why we got to put faith final
[1:26:16] resting places in the word of god not
[1:26:18] how you feel
[1:26:22] he's not a high priest of your feelings
[1:26:27] he's a high priest of your confession
[1:26:30] and if the spirit wasn't inside you
[1:26:33] wouldn't hear the truth let me read that
[1:26:34] one more time if the spirit wasn't
[1:26:37] inside you wouldn't hear the truth and
[1:26:39] receive it by revelation
[1:26:42] if you heard it every moment of the day
[1:26:45] 1100 servants rounding around the world
[1:26:47] from 1965 until today it has not done
[1:26:51] away with one denomination
[1:26:54] it has not kept women of the world from
[1:26:56] cutting their hair wearing skirts not
[1:26:58] wearing pants
[1:27:00] only the elect
[1:27:03] it's who that was too
[1:27:05] and you have to decide whether you're
[1:27:07] that elect or not
[1:27:10] that was the sign of the indwelling
[1:27:11] spirit in the days of paul
[1:27:13] those who were filled with the holy
[1:27:15] ghost heard the word
[1:27:17] received it
[1:27:19] oh here's the tough one
[1:27:21] and live by it
[1:27:25] those who did not have the spirit heard
[1:27:27] it only as carnal men
[1:27:29] put a wrong interpretation on it and
[1:27:32] went into sin
[1:27:35] in every age and every age is the age of
[1:27:37] the holy ghost for the true believer i
[1:27:39] say in every age the evidence was the
[1:27:42] same
[1:27:43] those who had the spirit the teacher
[1:27:45] heard the word
[1:27:47] and that spirit in them
[1:27:49] took the word and taught it revealed it
[1:27:52] to them
[1:27:56] you're going to hear your part of the
[1:27:57] word today if you've got the holy ghost
[1:27:59] he's obligated to take that and spin it
[1:28:02] around not put a spin on it
[1:28:04] spin it around in your soul
[1:28:07] mix it with faith
[1:28:10] mix it with some faith
[1:28:11] and say that ain't nothing but the truth
[1:28:13] had it right
[1:28:14] change two boys lives that ain't nothing
[1:28:16] but the truth
[1:28:20] the little wash woman didn't have two
[1:28:21] nickels brother brown said to rub
[1:28:23] together
[1:28:26] and they were of the group that heard
[1:28:28] the message messenger looked and his
[1:28:30] message and took it and lived it
[1:28:33] wherefore land inside all malice all
[1:28:35] guile hypocrisies and envies all evil
[1:28:37] speaking as newborn babes we have to
[1:28:39] start there desiring the sincere milk of
[1:28:40] the word that you may grow thereby if so
[1:28:43] be that you have what if so be that
[1:28:45] you've tasted that the lord is gracious
[1:28:48] first corinthians 12 3 musicians get
[1:28:50] ready to come wherefore i give you to
[1:28:52] you give you to understand that no man
[1:28:55] speaking by the spirit of god
[1:28:57] calleth jesus a curse
[1:28:59] and that no man can say that jesus is
[1:29:01] the lord but by the holy ghost and we
[1:29:03] were talking about the potter so we'll
[1:29:05] get we'll skip through that now we know
[1:29:07] that simon peter serving the apostle of
[1:29:08] jesus christ of them that have obtained
[1:29:10] light precious faith all right like
[1:29:12] precious faith
[1:29:13] with us through the righteousness of god
[1:29:15] and our savior jesus christ grace and
[1:29:16] peace be multiplied unto you through the
[1:29:18] knowledge of god
[1:29:19] and jesus our lord according as his
[1:29:21] divine power that dunamis that holy
[1:29:24] ghost has given unto us all things that
[1:29:26] pertain into life and godliness put god
[1:29:30] first
[1:29:33] we don't do that
[1:29:34] i don't do that you know we don't do it
[1:29:36] enough do you ever just wake up in the
[1:29:39] morning and say god

[1:30:12] testament
[1:30:16] listen folks there's grace in that old
[1:30:18] testament we know there's a law but
[1:30:20] there's grace in the old testament folks
[1:30:23] i mean come on rahab
[1:30:25] ruth
[1:30:26] you know ruth was a mobile woman
[1:30:28] and do you know that according to the
[1:30:30] law
[1:30:31] she could not enter a congregation of
[1:30:33] the jews for four ten generations four
[1:30:36] years
[1:30:38] but she married the king
[1:30:41] she married boaz and boaz says whatever
[1:30:43] she is i'll take it
[1:30:45] gentile whatever you are i know you're a
[1:30:47] bunch of dogs but i'll take you
[1:30:52] you know what our boat said
[1:30:54] i know you passed
[1:30:56] i know you came from a
[1:30:58] bad situation i know you came from moab
[1:31:01] but now

[1:31:04] and i'm going to take you for a bribe
[1:31:08] and i'm even going to put the lineage of
[1:31:10] my son through that
[1:31:13] rahab

[1:31:18] ruth wasn't a virgin either
[1:31:21] whoa
[1:31:22] her husband was dead
[1:31:25] she wasn't very pure either she was a
[1:31:27] mobilist they should have kicked her
[1:31:28] back into her country
[1:31:30] but boaz said no
[1:31:32] i'll cover
[1:31:34] whatever she's done i'll cover it
[1:31:37] whatever you've done today i'll cover it
[1:31:40] i'll cover it because you're my bride
[1:31:43] make a step toward him and he'll make a
[1:31:45] step towards you

[1:31:51] that you've got i want it to cover me
[1:31:55] let's stand to our feet i wanted to
[1:31:56] cover me today
[1:32:00] besides just giving all diligence add to
[1:32:02] your faith
[1:32:03] now faith is the substance come on
[1:32:05] musicians
[1:32:06] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:32:08] for the evidence of things not seen
[1:32:11] and we'll keep reading you know what
[1:32:12] we'll start and read it later on but
[1:32:13] without faith look without faith is
[1:32:15] impossible to please god
[1:32:17] you can't please god without faith
[1:32:20] for he that cometh to god must believe
[1:32:21] that what he is what he is god amen
[1:32:24] and that he is a rewarder
[1:32:26] of them that come every once in a while
[1:32:31] that diligently
[1:32:32] seek him
[1:32:34] now you cannot be was saved without
[1:32:36] faith faith is something that you have
[1:32:38] to believe is there there's really
[1:32:40] nothing else will declare it
[1:32:42] but faith
[1:32:45] now i'm trying to bring faith to you so
[1:32:47] that you can be ready for a prayer line
[1:32:48] in the next few minutes
[1:32:50] look watch this we'll read this and then
[1:32:51] we'll stop it's impossible to please god
[1:32:53] without faith
[1:32:55] you cannot please him and if you say you
[1:32:57] believe god you've never seen him see so
[1:32:59] when you've got to believe it by faith
[1:33:02] and if you could see him it would be no
[1:33:04] more faith
[1:33:07] like coming to church
[1:33:09] i i i don't believe that that i'm going
[1:33:11] to meet louise in church today
[1:33:13] i'm looking at it
[1:33:15] but i had to have faith in the journey
[1:33:18] to get here
[1:33:19] you got to have faith in a journey to
[1:33:22] get you to a place
[1:33:24] you got to believe it by faith
[1:33:26] and if you could see him it'd be no more
[1:33:28] faith
[1:33:29] anything that the senses declare is no
[1:33:31] more faith it's a scientific fact
[1:33:34] so we must believe first believe this is
[1:33:36] god's word and you must come to god
[1:33:40] by the word
[1:33:42] you've got to come by the word of god
[1:33:44] we'll talk about it this afternoon god
[1:33:45] bless you let's sing a song just one
[1:33:47] just one verse it's almost 12 o'clock

[1:34:04] oh it's a love
[1:34:06] beyond
[1:34:08] all human
[1:34:10] understanding
[1:34:13] that's what faith is it's beyond
[1:34:15] everything that you're saying
