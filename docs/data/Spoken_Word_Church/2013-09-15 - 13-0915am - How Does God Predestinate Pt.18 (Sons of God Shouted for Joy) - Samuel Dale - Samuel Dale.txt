========================================
eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart open the eyes i am as we sing is amen holy holy amen amen and amen and we just look right into his word and we find him don't we because that's where he's sitting looking at us amen good to see everybody in the house of the lord we're glad to have all of you with him and have brother tim calhoun there with us today and for him to be here just say welcome i don't see any other we see sister murray back there glad to have her back with us and the lord take care of her remember down sister anna canard she was she came home yesterday she's still having a lot of problems and all you know but that'll the lord taken care of because he really got her out of the hospital quick and and everything's working real good so remember that remember uh sister brenda's sick remember her many others that are sick among us there's one thing after another one but we believe god is the healer and we thank god for that amen remember now the fellowship meeting will be this coming saturday in alabama we'll be leaving about 10 30. and just if you want to go along with us uh just come and be with us and we'll we'll ride

for brother harris today so remember him and brett the lord would bless and any other announcements i generally miss something okay so maybe we'll maybe we got them all uh just keep praying for brother richard wilts and i talked to him this morning because we talked peggy had talked to him earlier in the week therefore last week uh he passed one of those kidney stones so we thank god for that you know and he still has one bothering him so let's just believe for that one and just ask the lord to take care of it amen you like turn in your scriptures turn to romans eight in job 38 romans 8 and job 38 amen heavenly father we thank you for this day and the hour that we have and the time upon the earth to be able to just sit down for a little bit this morning and to listen to you as you express yourself unto us from your revealed word we love your word and we thank you for all things and we praise your great name we ask you now to just be with each one forgive our sins lead us lord be with those that are not here today and just bless each one remember the sick among us you promised it you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we we just rest in that have your way now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts and our lives in jesus name amen romans 8 28 for we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called him he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified and i love that part this is about 18 times we've read this scripture on the services so i love that don't you what shall we then say to these things all of this above what can we say if god be for us who can be against us amen let's go over to job and just read job because that's where i thought we'll be connecting to the day you have it up from the fourth verse but we'll start verse one then the lord answered job out of the whirlwind and said what is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge group now thou loins like a man now listen to it you know he tells him another time to stand up amen you know all right for i will demand of thee and the answer that i mean where was thou when i laid the foundation of the earth declare if thou hast understanding who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who has stretches the line upon it whereupon are the foundations there are facing or who laid the cornerstone thereof when the morning stars signed together and all the sons of god shouted for joy you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now we have been uh to some of you new ones that think about it jesus he reads the same scripture i have read the same scripture 100 times and preached 100 services off of it so i don't worry about 18 you know you can't wear out the word of god you can't uh there's no way to do it it's eternal so we'll maybe we'll get to the point one of these days and we'll see it we can look back and see how eternal it really is but what we've been talking about now we've been talking about how does god predestinate how does he predestinate all right we found that he predestinates before knowledge all right and we found a prophet as saying that predestination looks back to foreknowledge see then foreknowledge comes before predestination all right because see predestination is setting a destiny all right to set a destiny you must first have knowledge of what that would do in god see uh even we said a a project brother tim's working on a project there in florida they set a project to do so and so and so and so and so and so all right now they had a lot of foreknowledge before then because uh that was what gave them the idea or the thought or the doings to to do that but see in god now he foreknew all things as we've read here so then he could predestinate by his foreknowledge all right then that way uh even election the prophet said is set by foreknowledge yes so then if we get that correct in our mind we'll see foreknowledge is a very important thing we used to want to all lay everything on predestination and then you had the baptists of presbyterians you had the different churches that taught those doctrines coming down and we got hooked up on just a predetermining factor of a lot of things you know and as we did then we had to get away from that to begin to see the message of the hour of the bible it says those who he foreknew he did predestinate our for no see all right now so we know that the prophet says god doesn't predestinate by his desires because he desired that everybody be saved he predestinates by his foreknowledge all right and really it's because of your desire if you want to determine anything on predestination remember your destiny is set because of your desire what you desire is what god works on and if you desire to serve god he'll make a way amen but if you don't desire to do that then he doesn't have to worry about it because you're making your own choice see then he made us all free moral agents to be able to choose what we would do and free moral agency then is to do and you say yeah but god chose me yeah but just remember if you do not accept what he uh in his choosing you've got to accept it because if you don't accept it he won't override your free moral agency all right see then we must accept salvation amen to not to just say well i always was all right now we we went through the message and and the doings of the prophet to cover all of these things and and we'll we'll keep on going through until we we uh get on and what we want to do today is bring this message and then we're going to try to start going back in another direction uh because you know what i've been doing now for months is bringing up for knowledge then we got into the mind of god all right because i do not believe that there was any people back there with god because he wouldn't be self-existing all right now if if that part would be people there like are as the uh mormons believe that we were back there with him and some of the others believing in the soul part and trying to make pre-existence out of things well i believe in pre-existence of eternal life amen that's the only pre-existence i can believe in amen is eternal life and eternal life is god all right that's god's own life see i i noticed yesterday brother random asked the question he said are there two eternal lives he said no there's just one there's just one eternal life all right then that eternal life that we have i'm a firm believer then and always have taught it this way to believe it that you and i were not back there as people we were not back there in any form other than the form of the eternal amen all right so then if we are part of the eternal then the part of the eternal that we are was in god all right i agree with that so then i believe we must receive eternal life by the new birth all right then that means that i didn't come with it but i come with all of the uh things making ready for it because god knew that i want eternal life so he had to die to release that life there is no salvation the old testament saints they do not they didn't have eternal life because jesus christ the bible said hadn't died yet so when he died he released that life yes one of the old testament saints will never be the bride they'll be the old testament jehovah bride yeah the israels of god but they'll never be the bride because see that that's a specific designation all right then to receive eternal life that eternal life you receive always was eternal amen amen so i can say now within me i have eternal life by the new birth and that life always was eternal that's right okay we're right we're in the message see we can follow and not have any problems with it so then i i was going through there the last couple of services where brother man said and he gave the question if that's right if you've got eternal life that's 17 times i mean if you got it right there's a question and it was about eight times if we have or if you have all right there's a question to it if we have eternal life the eternal life we have always wasn't eternal and i like to illustrate it like that john says that his seed remain within us and we cannot sin now that doesn't mean we can't do wrong because we're human beings we're mortals we do wrong every day we make mistakes every day we got all kind of problems all right but that seed cannot sin you're not dealing about the person you're dealing about the seed so if i have eternal life then that eternal life that i have always was eternal and is a part of god and it's not a second person as a son of god as we call it in the terms of our word because you'd have eternal sonship amen you remember we gave it where the prophet said he believed in eternal godship but not eternal sonship a son can't be eternal he said well jesus was the son of god he was god made manifest in flesh called a son that's right he was god manifested called a son because there's no such thing as you know god the father god the son god the holy ghost that's not in the bible that's right because that would make the trinity run and it won't work because we believe in one true and living god all right so we spent so much time i'm hoping you're not losing that point that we back went back as brother brown said in christ the mystery god revealed that we can go back into the back part of god's mind and see that god had a plan and a purpose he had a motive in doing it to let himself be expressed all right and in doing that everything was foreknown of him no problem with that then by foreknowledge he knew jacob would desire the birthright but he knew esau would reject it so he could write it down and say jacob have i love he saw how i hate it before they were ever even born why because if it's for knowledge unknowing what they would do when they got here all right now but doing that part we go back there and see that there was nothing existing but god alone so if there's any part that we even talk about as to be eternal yes right it would mean that would have to be part of god the new birth eternal life you receive the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth that is god's own life imparted into you it's not a second person amen brother said jesus said god is not a first person second person he said he's the person person of eternal life what about that all right but what we're trying to do now we're going to get this message out of the way and then this afternoon we'll start condescending more downwardly coming back into life and time and predestination and for knowledge and dealing with it but i want to get this one out of the way because of where it is placed at and by looking at eternal life eternal life has no beginning and has no end all right so then if it is it would have to be part of god's own life and we had the questions and answers this past wednesday that even the foolish virgins will receive eternal life that's right at the white throne but that doesn't make them bright amen why because they had nothing to do with it here they didn't receive eternal life here so they must go to the white throne but that eternal life that he gives them will be eternal life amen right but it will not make them the bride of christ all right 144 000 receive eternal life here right yes but that will not make them the bride that's right a lot of difference in the bride and where we stand because the bride is not now i've hounded this and hounded this on to you hoping you would understand me not trying to make you believe it but telling you what i believe and i'm not trying to prove any doctrine wrong that's not my do it my point is to tell what truth is amen all right the prophet said we're not trying to set a doctrine he said we're trying to correct all right seeing our thoughts must be put into the right channel that's right and i've emphasized over and over that we say you know we the people who say well the new birth makes me a son of god all right that's wonderful but what do you mean are you a son of jesus that was the son of god so your grandchildren but if we have eternal life dwelling in us just as jesus was god made manifest you agree not a second person or a third he didn't send a son he came himself amen we're not oneness we're true oneness true understanding all right now then as jesus was god made manifest in flesh the fullness of the godhead could dwell in him but you and i it can't dwell in us why because we're a many member body but the fullness of the godhead can dwell into the body of christ that's right all right i believe in that all right that would make us god manifest that's right amen the children of god yes your children are part of you amen right amen and see then the children of god watch it till when we get over here about the morning starts saying together and the sons of god shall enjoy if we have time uh watch that relate together with god in his doings if we have time to get there so we'll try to hurry up but now i want you to start with me and think about it if we wasn't back there god dwelt alone then he had attributes his attributes was father son and holy ghost that's his three attributes all right so if we have anything or any connection we must be connected through those attributes all right he had attributes to being a savior a healer right all right that would mean somewhere they would be somebody that would be right sick there was no need of him having an attribute there would be somewhere that somebody would need saving there would be no need of him having an attribute but just remember he never gained attributes he displayed after this he always had his attributes and see he then dwelt alone as the prophet would say with his attributes amen he said well that put us back there well now what is an attribute all right see what is an attribute we'll get to that in a second just that brother random ask the question but see he dwelt alone and he dwelt alone with his thoughts yes right god dwelt along with his thoughts all right but see now his thoughts are being displayed who do who do you say this is uh 1964 1227 but said he'll never do that again god dwelt alone with his thoughts he'll never do that again right why because his thoughts are being made manifest he'll never dwell alone that's why when you come through the bible and you you pick up the words and the understanding it'll go from god in genesis 1 but it'll go to lord god in genesis 2 you know like that why because it's him displaying himself manifesting himself all right but he dwelt alone now if we were ever there if there's ever thoughts about eternal life as that we always was eternal then you're going to have to deal with that we were there only in his thoughts in his mind all right but now have you been listening see my kids cannot i didn't sit down and think well now me and me and piggy we're going to get married and we're going to have three kids and we're going to name one wade and one terrence and one anna no see that's our doings you know we get married and we may talk it about it you know maybe some of you talked when you were dating you know and how many kids do we want to have when we get married well you know you someone one two five or whatever you know and uh i'm just glad mom and daddy they must have done a lot of talking because i'm the 13th one so i'm glad they've done a lot of talking all right all right but now think about it see that's us us in our thoughts see my thoughts can't be eternal now if god reveals something to me it comes as a thought right amen see first he spoke to moses it was moses thought then moses went out and said flies fleas frogs see all right that's a good point but see our thoughts are human thoughts that's why the bible said his ways is not our ways his thoughts are not our it's so much high above until we're not even in the picture but now think about it i do believe earnestly that god in his thoughts are more real than we think the prophet in the church age book said his thoughts are eternal all right he cannot have another thought we can think one day and then think another way but god can't when he said he'd save the first person by the blood he has to save everybody by the blood he can't change i mean he can't have a new thought because if he could have a new thought he wouldn't be god that's right he would just be like you and i now he can bring forth a thought and keep adding to the thought or more clarification like in genesis he said i put image between thy seed and the seed of the woman the promise of christ all right then come on over later and say that would come through abraham and then say it would come through david and then say it would be jesus christ that's bringing the thought and continuing it on that is not having a new thought he didn't go so far and think oh got to do something so he changed around went the other way you know no you got to remember we're talking about god being the infinite one and how else could you explain infinite than to say and i hate gnats they bother me he said now trying to deer hunting the gnats is all over the place you just you might as well go home you know all right but what about knowing every nap that there would be in the world and how many times that nap would bat its eye and how much taller that nat would make now that's just a human terminologies to understand an infinite god yes don't think you're going to pull anything over on him all right he knew before the world where we'd be today and what we'd be doing and what we'd be thinking if he didn't he's not god all right now then god's thoughts are more real you know i'm trying to get a point and then we'll go on to the then the point i've been trying to get you to see that we're the children of god i've been emphasizing that we are his offspring as paul said and being his children means that we're a part of him right we're a part of him all right now being a part of him did he think about us i know i ask odd questions i like to do that but at least you'll go home and think did he set up er well i could just have some kids and i might have a few of this and a few of that and i'll have some big ones and little ones and and i'll make a world and i'll make mountains and valleys and hills and did he sit there and think then his thought wasn't eternal if we lay on the basis that he thought about us be careful how you bring that relation because if he thought about us then there's no way for us to be eternal come on but if we were a part of that thought that's why i've always emphasized to you 40 years i don't want to be just what god thought of in his mind because judas is carrick was in god's mind just as well as anybody else that's right all right i want to be a part of the thinker you know somebody may have to translate that in some foreign country so just remember what i'm saying i want to be part of god not just something of a that he created that's right if he created you you had a beginning come on but if we're a part of him then there is no beginning all right then that way his stalks see he's not able to shut what would it be his thoughts are his attributes all right father son and holy ghost his attributes his thoughts is his attributes now in that he he wanted to be a father son and holy ghost right that's the thoughts of god that's the attributes of god all right to be that then we have to be somewhere connected in there to have eternal life all right so now his attributes that's who we are look what he said on number three pull it up for certain preaching 1964 the token we are the attributes of his thoughts all right and that's god's loyalty then you have it then you have eternal life because he is the only eternal there he is and we are the attributes of his thoughts before there was even a foundation of the world or anything all of this is just his thinking listen to him and we're the display of his thoughts of what it was see then he didn't sit down and think about us we have to use those terminologies what else could you use how else could you explain it we're going back into his mind he his thoughts is just as eternal as he is all right what is an attribute look at it marriage and divorce 1965 talk to number four you know that god god is an object of worship and there wasn't nothing to worship him he lived alone and in him was attributes what is an attribute now in him was attributes to be a healer to be a savior to be a redeemer et cetera to be father son and holy ghost to make manifest that upon earth right because he would have to come and die for our sins to be the savior and to be beaten to be the healer so that would mean he would have to come into that as we call it sonship life existence upon earth all right then in doing that what are we what is an attribute a thought a thought it was in him to be fathers in him to be god it was in him to be son it was in him to be savior within him to be healer and all these things here are just displaying his attributes all right what is an attribute what are god's attributes his thoughts what are we his thoughts being displayed right all right then in dealing with that to be that part there would be only one way we could do that and you'll see that i firmly believe in it look at look at the next one all right let's see i don't think i give them to paragraph 29 you gotta roll it on that this is taken from why i'm against organized religion and when we are born again of the spirit of god we become eternal with god because we have part of his life which makes us sons and daughters of god then we have eternal life and the life that is in us now god will raise up the body et cetera all of the things will take place what is it we have part of his life as i say in a while ago then the reason you use the word part is because none of us can be the fullness so we would be apart all right jesus was the fullness all right being a part of his life all right look what he says on who is this melchizedek you were there in his attributes you don't remember it no because you're just a part of his life you are part of god when you become a son and daughter of god all right that's coming back down on this side coming down to when we will start talking about the new birth all right but an attribute an attribute is a part of god and as i said now the foolish virgin will one day receive eternal life right people at the white throne will receive eternal life correct filth sealed you will receive eternal life uh the different ones that will receive eternal life now you know for certainty they're not a part of god because they will have to receive it but once they receive it they will receive it as an impartation and that impartation will be the part of god which is life we'll get to adam maybe this afternoon or further down see adam had nothing to do with what he had god gave him blasphemous names eternal life breathed into his nostrils but everybody after adam and eve they didn't receive eternal life when it was born you'd have to admit some didn't so then you can go with that thought all right that they don't receive eternal life all right now if god dwelt alone and it was self-existing see i don't have any trouble with the eternal life that he has that i now have all right you understand me eternal life that he is that i now have amen that eternal life that we have by the new birth always was eternal i have no problem with that because that's beautiful if not you'd be a child of jesus and be a child of god that make your grandchild then it won't work so jesus had to be almighty god not a second person amen well i always thought he was the son of god no he was god manifested in the flesh called the son that was why that he was killed not for saying he was the son of god go back and read your bible matthew mark luke and john you'll find out he was killed for saying they said you're a man making yourself god they didn't say you're a man making yourself a son of god they said you're a man making yourself god and we don't believe that but yet their whole teaching was that he would eventually come and would be that because they were looking for the messiah they just didn't believe that was the messiah you know why because they thought they might get to be it themselves there's that ego we go back to why did them pharisees what right did the pharisees and the sadducees religious leaders how to reject jesus christ i want a sensible explanation that used to bother me in the baptist church when i was there i studied the word of god and i used to read i thought why in the world do they hate that man all he did was heal the and fed him right how about getting a meal any time you want it and how about when you're sick it just heals you if you die you just raise you up that's right where did they have any right to reject him because he didn't come the way they thought that's right all right what in the high priest i believe he's god because if he's the messiah that's who he's got to be no he wouldn't get up and do that you know why because he didn't come down and bow down and kiss kaffi's big toe that's right does that bring you down to the day done over in the catholic church you know all right not against them just telling you like it is but you see confidence had it figured out that one day there'd be a great blast come out of heaven and there'd be somebody and just roll a carpet right out and he'd end right at confidence's feet and he'd walk right up the confidence and say i'm here right you tell me any other reason for rejecting him he didn't come the way they thought he'd come yet the bible said he would come that way the bible said he'd be born a virgin yes the bible said it would be god manifested in flesh see the jews today are looking for a messiah and they believe a messiah will be god in human flesh that's right now there's about 49 different versions you'll go check it all out they had a god here in new york not too long ago 90 something years old they thought he was a messiah but he died it didn't fit too good but listen church i'm talking about god's children as to being part of god see that would be the children of god but not exist back there as people's identities of course i can show you where the prophet said that before the world he knew exactly your height your hair color your eye color everything about you yes amen if he didn't he ain't gone that's in smoke all right but yet now to come this away see we can pick up a lot of things but stand back there and just thinking by way of the prophet messenger because you and i can't go there i'd put that emphasis in there never service we don't go by our own doings this is not something brother dale thought of at least you gotta admit i'm reading what he said you might not like what he said but i mean you know i'm reading what he says all right now to do that then an attribute would be god's thoughts you say well then that would make us pre-existence brother dale i believe in pre-existence of eternal life i believe in pre-existence of god don't you i mean don't you believe in that at least pre-existence of god well then if i'm a part of god then i believe in a pre-existence but the only way to be a part of god is for me to receive the new birth we'll get to it when the morning starts saying together and see unto god shouted for joy of how it was back when the lambs were slain but that was only figuratively the lamb wasn't physically slain before the foundation of the world that's right come on we don't believe in pre-existence we believe in the truth of the gospel but believing it in the correct way now then let's try to get to the point i hope that'll bring you up to it so if god dwelt alone and we don't believe that we were with him like peoples you know but we're only with him or in him as attributes thoughts eternal now what did we get to it this afternoon when brother brown said god knew if he created me and you we would fall if he gave us a free morning agency he knew if we would have a free moral agency we'd fall well this ain't pulling nothing over on him and don't worry about it amen and to me what you talk about is saying was we back there if we're not following after him now then it's certain we wasn't back there because we're proving what we are now we are now displaying his attributes that's right that's right everybody wants to kick old thomas you know doubting thomas doubting thomas there's one thing about it when he got his hands in the nail prints he said i believe it the prophet said well sometimes we need just a little bit extra help to believe now but think about it when he dwelt alone we were part of being part of him the eternal life that we now have that we received when we got here by the new birth all right that eternal life was in god at the beginning amen and see then you know the only thing i asked the two soul people because you remember they had the two sold one come the devil one come from god and he had to be this it had to be that it dwelt on the seat a lot all right and i asked a simple question i i'm simple and i asked simple questions i said the new birth is it the birth of the word that we come into the world with that you say or is it the birth of the word we receive after we got here i said all i want to know never got an answer because if they said one i was standing on the other side i said i thought okay i'm not mean i'm just straight see which one was it what you were born with or what you which one is the birth because if you say it's the one you're born with then you don't need a preacher now you annihilated all of paul's writing that's true you see why they didn't want to answer they don't want to try to answer that because they knew what i'd say if it's a seed she was born with then you don't need a preacher right but if you got to have a preacher then there must be something about that seed we don't understand that we say we're born with all right so that's what we're trying to get to the point but i want to get this and then we'll start back downward into so let's go to go ahead with uh joel come excuse me job 38 brother just pull that up where we can read it because here's where we're going to go to job was asked a question where was you when this happened were you when that happened and you remember joe was a smart man he was the smartest in the world he was very intelligent very smart man and he kind of got a little bit uh if you'll go back and study prior to this and study what the prophet is saying about him he got just a little bit too high in his own thinking self-righteousness right and as he did see then god just took the plots right over and under him and said where was you i've done this i've done that i've done this i've done that i've done it can you tell me how that got done and old job he's sit down and he said but job i'm not going to leave you embarrassed i want to ask you a major question job where were you when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy job was finally given a great understanding yes one day god said stand up job i want to talk to you like a man he said i know my redeemer liveth he got his answer to the questions it would deal with a redeemer because if you stay where this is existence at you have no uh manifestation reality you have figuratively uh but nothing real in what you call tangibilities are points of talking about a redeemer we'll get to it in a minute where the prophet of god said the lamb slain before the foundation where he said that was figuratively in god's mind that was not a reality as far as god is concerned it was reality but it wasn't physical all right so job where were you when the morning started saying together and the sons of god shouted for joy now where were you joe he said you just hold on a little while and i'll speak to you and you'll see the redeemer coming and you'll understand why this was happening why those angels were singing and why they were doing him but what we're going to be dealing with for a little bit when did this take place that the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy when did this take place where did it take place and who is it speaking of all right now so let's go real fast in reading until we get down to a point then we'll slow down go to number five brother anderson this is taken from called witnesses 1953 405 paragraph 140. someone was talking the other day about that brother branham and ed or ask him said do you have a new kind of religion he said no sir i'm preaching to hope i'm preaching the oldest religion there ever was and the only one there is and got salvation in it all right now oldest religion you remember that was the part when they asked him some questions look he said it's older than the world now what does he say now where was you when i laid the foundation of the world when the morning started saying together and the sons of god shouted for joy millions of years before the foundation of the world when did this scene know the morning stars singing together son of god shouting for joy when did it take place millions of years go ahead to the next number six the ministry of christ 1953 607 paragraph 43 e43 talk about shouting something new well why it's the oldest religion in the world the shouting religion well thousands of years before the world was ever formed god asked job one day he said they didn't ask job before the world because you get his point all right god asked job one day said where was you when i laid the foundation of the world when the morning starts saying together and the sons of god shouted for joy talk about something new we just got a new case of the old kind of kind that's all certainly shouting for joy what a time all right going to the next this is taken christ of mr god revealed 63 728 to my opinion the first thing that he made was angels now remember that for a minute we're getting down here we've got to drop back from there downward all right but we'll get to that statement and when they worship him made him god and he started from there that was before see when the angels began to worship him that was before there was even a molecule in the earth there was nothing it was all darkness there was nothing no sun nor no moon no stars no nothing then he was god and he asked job where was you when i laid the foundation of the world see when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy see where were you see that was way back before the earth all right back before anything come into being whatsoever all right now remember then and we'll get to an answer to one question who were these morning stars and listen don't get me lost on it and run your computers real fast on your head i do know a little bit about the morning stars and the cherubims and the things and and i do know that you can bring it to the children of god of morning stars but i do know that's not what he's talking about here okay i just put that on our case people come and they say i don't have to listen to him he don't even understand well i just put it out the word now you ain't got nothing to argue with me about right so that was before there was even a molecule in the earth there was no sun it was nothing it was back before the foundation world who are these now we'll answer the question because he said the first thing that was made was angels now i'm going to catch you in just a second because we're going to go over and then fall backward okay so now listen real careful stay awake and do the point so he's saying these were angels let's see what he says go on down just make sure we answer it with the prophet why we are not a denomination 1958 927 and then before there was one speck of life on the earth our bodies was laying here before there's any speck of light on the earth i mean our bodies would let you where do you think our bodies come from let's come out of this earth okay come on before one drop of moisture ever come on the earth we were laying here when adam walked up and down in the garden i was laying here amen yes sir oh glory when the cherubims the morning stars sang together now he's telling you who these are of the morning stars their cherubims are angels all right now morning stars standing together and the sons of god shouted for joy i was laying here just waiting for the breath of life to come i was here he made me hear i had my body laying here you see how positive brother brown can talk and then when he says you always was eternal what's he talking about he can talk about your body laying in the earth whenever we're first created and that's true they didn't a little bitty drop of mars come flying down through the sky and drop down on earth and your body come from that that's right because you just remember mars venus and all of that at one time was one thing together and then it blasted out all right see but see just talk about your body that's laying here but that's not eternal right that's not eternal going to the next one number nine which is paragraph 283 that was to our paragraph 241 and one we're not a denomination the morning stars saying together the sons of god shouted for joy before there was a foundation in the world see before there was a foundation and then my angels and everything was happy shouting about it before there was a foundation of the world how is the ever devil going to keep you in the dust of the earth you just can't do it okay look on to the next one the first time angels this is taken from white had to be shepherds 1964 12 21. i give that because some people out there can't pick it up on the screen and some people are just listening so they don't get the first time angels ever sang at a celebration it was in heaven so now where is this event taking place we've answered that the cherubims as angels the morning stars sang together as angels all right now we're answering the question what it was in heaven all right and if you look in job 38 7 as i said as i see some of you taking notes when god first planned on making his first creation here joe was a great smart man he was kindred smart you know but what was he the first time i angels you run it on down to paragraph 94 and you'll see the first time angels that were saying celebration was in heaven now that answers the where it was at it's in heaven it answers who the morning stars are now let's answer the other one while we're on it look at number 11 the serpent seed paragraph 1 1958 928 where was you when i laid he asked job when i laid the foundation of the earth when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy who were those sons of god that were shouting for joy and he said who were they now he answers it jesus told them that now who'd he tell he told the disciples yes right jesus told them that i had joy with you before the foundation of the world we're not creatures of time we're creatures of eternity and no man can come to me except my father draws him all right listen so these sons of god shouting for joy is he told the disciples that he knew him i gave you a quote just the other day on that all right so we've answered the questions where did this take place in heaven when did it take place back in eternity who were the morning stars angels now who are the sons of god shouting for joy is you and i if it was disciples it means us right but us with eternal life yes all right so now the answers to all of the questions has come into being so we can talk about something else then we go a little further look at the next one spiritual amnesia 1964 411 paragraph 98. 89 excuse me notice he is in me and i in him notice then every christian that's a genuine christian christian was with him when the morning star sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy all christians was with him all right we were identified in the immortal realms with god 10 million years before the world was ever formed i was back there with him if i got eternal life i was there with him i was identified with him when the morning stars sang together the sons of god shouted for joy so number two so you can see where we're at all right i like to prove things as i go along then you don't have a right of argument were we were we spirits back then brother branham 1959 6 28 questions and answers target 169 were we spirits then no we were not even nothing then but in god's mind we were and he spoke it and it materialized okay and when he saw me he saw you before the foundation of the world we were only figurative in his mind right only figurative in his mind but get the foundation jesus was slain before how many knows that the bible teaches that jesus was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world well god spoke it and when he spoke it was good it's finished and when he saw me and he saw you before the foundation of the world we were only figurative figurative means what you were only figurative what does the word figurative mean it means a resemblance or a figure we were not back there in him as people amen right right we were not spirits no we was in his mind so now this place in heaven that we're talking about and this scene that we're talking about now we conclude one thing it was in his mind are you listening amen we've established it in heaven and way before the world now we're establishing one fact this was in his mind not reality far as god is concerned yes but it was in his mind before the world all right look at 13 a waters of separation 56 121 paragraph eleven now the separation christ was the lamb of god slain from the foundation of the world you believe that you believe christ was the lamb's flame that's revelation what 13 8 the lamb's flame before the foundation world was that real notice always he was the lamb slain figuratively what's he saying jesus christ never died physically before the world you and i were not physically for the world so get it out of your mind us back our shouting in some physical form this is still in his mind this was not a physical happening okay you need another one with it e16 the power of god preaching 56 10 06 in the evening no one could tell him anything about it but he by faith he's seen the son of god coming and offered a lamb and a figurative type all right seeing that jesus was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world god testified that's the truth god will always testify the truth but where was it was it in physical or what was it it was figurative means like a resemblance the word figurative means it's not real you know as far as we call real what we call realism tangibilities flesh blood you know what etc he was in his mind now let's prove that let's prove this scene that we're talking about the morning stars singing together sons of god shouting for joy now i'm going to say this and so you listen real careful this was before any angel was created but they can't sign you got to get angels first that's when we start downward this is in god's mind okay go ahead and let's read it uh go to number 14 which is the serpent seed all right and as we thought in the blessed word that we had fellowship with him for the foundational world when the morning started saying together the sons of god shouted for joy way back for the foundation of the world how do we know that that wasn't at the same time that the lamb was slain that when god in his great thinking seen us shouting and rejoicing in our salvation through jesus amen it's only in his thinking yes sons of god shout at morning stars singing son of god shout out yeah but it hasn't come into being yet that's right but you better hold some little points i hope i can do it you better hold on just a little bit from here on a couple of words so now when did this take place how do we know that wasn't the same time that the lamb was flying and when god in his great thinking seeing us shouting and rejoicing in our salvation through jesus it's in his mind right hang on just a minute now i've got a little bit more to go with this okay some unwritten pages come on okay most of you know when i say unwritten i don't like to write down something look what he says on adoption 1965 18 paragraph 151 he said being displayed in the prodigal son this is my son was lost and found he's dead and he's alive again bring forth a fatted calf know what no wonder when the morning stars signed together and the sons of god shouted for joy open your eyes and read that when they sing the plan of salvation evidently according to the prophet there was somewhere the bride of christ saw the plan of salvation okay god put your name on the book before the foundation of the world no wonder the morning starts saying again the son of god shouted for joy when they seen the plan of salvation look at the last one we'll be reading the rejected king 65 515 paragraph 57 just rolled it on down to the bottom he's talking about the oldest religion he was at the hospital you know and he was getting ready i think this is the one getting ready to go overseas and uh you know and he was there in the hospital and i always bring this now because it's comical to me you know i'm kind of relaxing you a second before i start talking uh how many of you would like uh uh gail how would you like it that brother dick would be laying up in the hospital you know you know and you come walking in you know there's nobody in the room but him is him and this nurse and she's a young girl cause right around said she was and she's up there massaging brother dick's back feels better right you answered cause you're old she said cause she'd want one of them to joyce what would you say some of you young ones what would you say get your hand off my husband right brother brandon was laying there letting this girl massage his back those old days that's before people got to thinking about all of the things you know and it'd become all the bad things you know right that's back in the old days but she was talking to him about religion which one was you know is that is that a new one he said no ma'am he talked about her religion said that only about 200 years ago that organization but this organization started when the morning stars sang together the sons of god shouted for joy when they seen the coming of a savior to redeem mankind okay what about that what do you think about it we prove that this scene is in heaven we've proved who they are the angels can prove to the sons of god it's the bride of jesus christ is taking place in heaven it was in god's thinking now what do you think about it i don't believe we were back there in any form other than being a part of god okay this is not a physical taking place it was only figurative in god's mind all right so it must have been god's thinking of what would be and not what it was right there would you agree yes it would have to be what he was thinking that would take place because now see we're going to drop back down and start this afternoon to that foreknowledge we're dropping right back into full knowledge so god in his great thinking could see us shouting for joy and see the angels that would finally be created and that you and i would finally come into being but he could see it in his mind but notice it says we read there that these sons of god would see the plan of salvation we're not lost yet right there's nothing lost yet but the prophet said the sons of god seen the plan of salvation all right he says they've seen the coming of a redeemer to bring forth the plan of redemption but they never experienced this back there are you going to put people back there when you start doing that and may i illustrate it paul one day he stood there and he says brother brown said it this way he said get it out of your mind that the lord is coming right now he said because there's got to be a falling away the man of sin has got to come paul could look all the way down and see our day and see when it would command the man of sin he could not only look that he could look by the spirit of god forward into the future from where he was two thousand years and he could say that the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voice over and archangel on the trump of god but to paul that wasn't real because he never experienced it he had to die and go by the grave he's waiting on you and i to catch this plan of salvation now even though on calvary he said it is finished and even though the holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost the complete plan of redemption was not made known back there if it was what are we doing the complete plan of salvation the saving of the soul sure the speaking of prophecy but it's changed in a moment a twinkling of an eye paul could speak of that about the future in the spirit but yet it was not in a reality all right now we maybe need to get into something that i've tried to explain i've spoke for quite a while about us being the children of god and being his offspring and being a part of him and being a part of his own life and by the new birth receiving that eternal life into our soul to make our soul eternal amen now god knew that when he created man he was going to fall we'll start there this afternoon he knew that he knew all he had to do was put him on free moral agency that was ease problem she had a choice she made the wrong choice adam just as bad because he made the choice to go with her so that's three more agency all right but to see a redeemer to come with the plan of salvation in the mind of god back there we saw the complete plan i'm talking about we the bride those with eternal life that eternal life in you was a part of god at that time and by being a part of god at that time then this is no mystery to us sure it had to be revealed to us but is it a mystery no it's no longer a mystery it's been revealed we understand the complete plan of redemption right body spirit world oh they didn't have that back there at calvary it was there he redeemed all but he couldn't make it manifest the jews was redeemed at calvary but not applied am i quoting the prophet it means a lot to be a part of god amen amen now remember the setting i've made everybody understand this scene was back before the world it was in heaven it was in god's thinking it was not a reality jesus christ never died in a reality back there he died in the figurative in other words one day he would have to die all right so then god could start this away to come be down and the first thing he would create was angels and they would worship him yes you go there he became god we go to genesis 1. we'll start there this afternoon but show me where he ever created his children you didn't listen while ago he was amen and then let's see if you amen the only way god can be a creation is in christ jesus that's quoting brother branham amen he's the beginning of the creation of god and the prophet of god said we are the continuation of that creation now how is he the beginning of the creation of god oh i know all of it goes down to a baby being born and coming up i agree but you're not listening to word when he started before the world and that beginning of the creation of god was that logos that went out of god in the beginning that stood there and said let there be if you and i have eternal life we was right there with him sister gail when he said let there be in him right there when he said let there be i didn't say with him because we hadn't come forth yet would you show me where he ever created his people his children are not created they're born the birth which means they're coming forth into we'll get down to where the prophetess god said you didn't become seed by the new birth he said well you're already seek that's why you could be born again because only in the seed can be born because in non-seed there's nothing to quicken come on we've got a long ways to go we got a big message do you understand yes so in the mind of god he knew he was going to create angels amen and he knew if they'd seen the plan of salvation coming forth they'd shout but he really knew that he was going to bring his children into being and when his children would come forth do you not shout in your own maybe not physically and running and screaming and hollering but what about the day you received jesus christ as your savior wouldn't that a shout in time according to the bible the angels in heaven rejoice over one sinner that comes to salvation amen so they shout that's right they sing yes but they can't sing the song of redemption because they're not redeemed if you and i you say well what are you talking about see if we the eternal life that we have you have to agree that irregardless what your doctrine is you would have to agree that we have eternal life by the new birth if you say we come in the world with eternal life you're still going to have to agree it's eternal life that's right i mean don't make no difference if you come in the world eternal son then you go ahead with it you just believe what you're going to believe but just remember one time that's what i'm saying i'm not trying to correct doctrine or preach i'm trying to give real truth to understand yes even if i believe i come into this world he's eternal as god is physically body spirit and soul i'd still want this one point in mind that when i was a part of god before the world ever begun when i was in his thinking i was a part of him and it's not jehovah witness jehovah witness said we were all up in heaven excuse me mormon we were all up in heaven and we decided to come to earth to be lost where father could come and save us no but the eternal life that i have in me today knew before this world where i would be this day the prophet said look how that little thing worked itself out that he had to breed this one to that one to this one to that one even to get your body here amen amen he said that's even natural is predestinated yes yes what are you trying to say i'm trying to say one thing when the morning stars staying together and the sons of god shouted for joy it was in god's mind before the world ever begun but it was in god's mind to know what would take place when we got here and that way i can shout about my salvation and i can shout about knowing now not just a part of a plan of redemption not having to worry like we did down to the times until this prophet came you know what i'm talking about we all worried about where was going to get us a new body or where he was going to get there so we're going to get that yes until the prophet come into view with the word shouting for joy you mean you can't shout now and you wouldn't in god's mind shouting then is that plain enough amen come on musician is that enough if we can't shout and rejoice now you know why those angels are singing when a bird when a when a person is a born again christian the bible says that they are angels that are ministers of salvation to come to you and i and the day you was born again you receive an angel amen that's your protective guardian angel to guide you into the truth as it was in the garden he had they had to drive them out of the garden because of the sin those angels champions drove them out but now he's driving us back to the tree of life the day you were born again your prophet of god said god gave you an angel that angel knows what his job is he's one thing to take care of you to keep you from getting killed because the devil wants to get you that's right the minute you become a born-again christian the devil turns everything he's got on you he wants to kill you yeah but you got an angel to make sure it don't work amen you got an angel to lead you to salvation in the odd we talk a lot about angels in the nod we believe in a seven church age messenger as an angel they come to bring us a message a message of redemption why can't we shout church why can't we sing and worship and believe him yes to see what he's done for you and i if you understand what i'm saying i'm gonna say it one more time just get on with it if you have eternal life then that life was in god when the what that where the morning stars he saw that angels would be singing but we knew the plan of salvation yes you said we we knew it back there the prophet says we don't remember right right it's not napoleon i feel like i was back there stupidity i'm talking about those who have received eternal life by the new birth are now the offspring of god the children of god make manifest on earth and why can't we shout amen and have a good time in our salvation yes see your hearing may i quote it and then i'll get to it later did the prophet say when you've done these things he said you heard from what you heard from your theophany that's what this male melchizedek but how about page 80 of the hebrew book the soul of adam and eve was their theophany got a big message yes that's why i believe it when you're born again your soul is your theophany this is preparing us to go to a place amen we already started our journey go ahead what do we got 380 380 inspired and i love this song don't you anybody have a need i wish i had a voice to holler and scream something happened and know that it's all gone because we believe him don't we father in the name of jesus christ we lay our hands upon our brother he said his left shoulder has been hurt and we just ask you father to take away the money we condemn it now in the name of jesus christ oh yes he touched me something happened or i was he touched me my soul is is he touched me oh yes he touched me there's something is you
