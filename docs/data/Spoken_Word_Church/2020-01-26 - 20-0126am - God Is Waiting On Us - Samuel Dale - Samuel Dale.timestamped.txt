[25:38] among us have you weigh Lord and that's
[25:40] your light shine in our hearts Lord just
[25:43] let the understanding that we have need
[25:47] of because we need that more than
[25:49] anything else we have the word
[25:52] we can read it things but we need it
[25:55] revealed to us and we asked you to just
[25:57] have your way Lord and open our eyes to
[25:59] it
[26:00] guide us in Jesus name we'll start
[26:07] reading on verse 32 but before you do
[26:10] that I'll just read this one verse 13
[26:13] now remember Hebrews 11 is the Old
[26:17] Testament Saints now you can enter
[26:20] relate to the last few verses and pick
[26:22] up God in this and that and bring in but
[26:25] that's fine that's that's no problem to
[26:26] bring in you know the New Testament part
[26:30] to it but mainly it's the Old Testament
[26:33] all right
[26:34] so then being in the Old Testament then
[26:37] we want to keep our thoughts into that
[26:40] line all right then
[26:42] it'll do so I'll read this one then
[26:45] we'll go into where we're going verse 11
[26:48] excuse me verse 13 of chapter 11 says
[26:51] these all died in faith now we reread
[26:54] this one I didn't know where they were
[26:56] going to get that okay not having
[27:00] received the promises now all of these
[27:04] Old Testament Saints died in faith not
[27:06] having received the promises okay but
[27:13] having seen them afar off and were
[27:15] persuaded of them and embraced them and
[27:18] confessed that they were strangers and
[27:20] pilgrims on the earth now we'll go to
[27:22] verse 32 and start our reading for today
[27:26] what shall I more say for the time would
[27:31] fail me to tell of gideon barak samson
[27:34] jephthah
[27:35] david also and samuel and the prophets
[27:38] who through faith subdued kingdoms
[27:40] wrought righteousness obtained promises
[27:43] stopped the mouths of lions quenched the
[27:46] violence of fire escaped the edge of the
[27:50] sword out of weakness were made strong
[27:52] waxed violent and fight turn to flight
[27:56] the armies of the aliens women received
[27:59] their dead raised up raised to life
[28:04] again
[28:05] were tortured not accepting deliverance
[28:08] that they might obtain a better
[28:10] resurrection and others at trial of
[28:14] cruel mockings and engorge NGA moreover
[28:17] of bonds and imprisonment they were
[28:20] stoned they were sawn asunder were
[28:22] tempted were slain with the sword they
[28:25] wandered about in sheepskins and
[28:26] goatskins being destitute afflicted
[28:29] tormented of whom the world was not
[28:31] worthy they wandered in deserts and in
[28:35] mountains and in dens in caves of the
[28:37] earth now here is almost a repeat of the
[28:40] one we read verse 13 now once and these
[28:44] all having obtained a good report
[28:46] through faith received not the promise
[28:53] okay
[28:54] remember verse 13 see they they didn't
[28:57] get to promise all right these all died
[29:00] in faith not having received the
[29:02] promises well now what are you talking
[29:04] about see now watch them God having
[29:07] provided some better thing for us that
[29:09] they without us should not be made
[29:11] perfect you may be seen in the Lord at
[29:13] his blessing to the reading of the word
[29:16] now what I want to do is because we
[29:21] preached on this not too long ago you
[29:23] know we're always doing that but I want
[29:25] you to lay into the thought of thinking
[29:28] about they without us cannot be made
[29:33] perfect so they're waiting on you and I
[29:37] all right now our thought for today is
[29:41] this God is waiting on you and I now see
[29:51] we're trying to pick it up to a higher
[29:54] order because we're gonna have to come
[29:56] through the Old Testament Saints and
[29:58] cover that right and come into that part
[30:01] and coming through the church ages and
[30:02] all to tie together all together but
[30:04] when we finish in the the ending of the
[30:07] message I'm saying that were that when
[30:09] you come to that you'll see what I'm
[30:11] talking about that God is waiting on us
[30:16] yeah but now now we're always waiting on
[30:19] him well
[30:20] well he might be waiting on us okay so
[30:27] let's take that thought in our mind but
[30:28] let's keep it together as understanding
[30:31] now that what we want to do remember as
[30:36] I said the Old Testament it says they
[30:41] could not be made perfect now we know
[30:44] that doesn't mean sinless perfection
[30:47] that is not what it's talking about
[30:50] it's talking about like Matthew 5:48 or
[30:54] B therefore perfect even as your father
[30:56] in heaven is perfect
[30:58] it means complete something is not
[31:03] complete alright we look back at those
[31:09] Old Testament Saints and we see that
[31:12] great things took place in great
[31:15] happenings and wonderful things and all
[31:17] like that and like I've always said we
[31:19] talked about we have the new birth and
[31:22] go look back at what they'd done without
[31:24] a new birth you know look at the things
[31:28] where they lived and what they'd done
[31:30] doing it by faith and then one of these
[31:34] days we will finally realize what and it
[31:36] says and the Prophet in fascitis so much
[31:39] that Abraham is the father of faith see
[31:46] then we'll see that there was something
[31:48] about it and I've always tried to
[31:50] express it this way Abraham was a man
[31:54] just like we are he was not no
[31:57] supernatural thing he didn't have the
[32:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost sure he could
[32:03] be anointed right that's fine and was
[32:07] and things happen and all I can't but
[32:09] yet still Abraham was just like a human
[32:12] being we know this thing didn't start
[32:15] was supernatural who who law faith are
[32:21] you following me this did not start that
[32:25] away because it had it started that away
[32:27] our women maybe was
[32:30] God started it that way but yet it fell
[32:32] away from his original plan but yet
[32:35] still his plan is coming forth and to be
[32:39] made manifested here and completed all
[32:42] right but my point of what I'm talking
[32:44] about see faith we look at faith and we
[32:46] try to figure out this and try to do
[32:48] that and all I can but just remember
[32:50] faith has to start by believing God just
[32:57] simply believing it doesn't start in a
[33:01] supernatural realm that's what I want
[33:04] you to get it comes into a supernatural
[33:06] room by the fact of starting in a
[33:09] natural realm and environment and time
[33:12] and people and things you know and
[33:15] looking back at them and saying look
[33:17] what they done without the baptism of
[33:21] the Holy Ghost well then you'll see why
[33:23] the Prophet would emphasize it like that
[33:25] he said if they could do that like that
[33:27] what about you and me with the baptism
[33:29] with the Holy Ghost
[33:30] all right but my point is one thing I've
[33:34] always emphasized this when I speak
[33:36] about Abraham Abraham was a man just
[33:40] like we are not a super-duper guy he
[33:45] just believed God God spoke to him one
[33:49] day said take your wife and he family
[33:51] get up and leave
[33:53] well there he was making a living
[33:57] probably was a real good living you know
[34:00] he was probably was doing great
[34:02] and he goes into his wife and he says
[34:03] honey packed a dud season wife said
[34:05] we're leaving there where we're going
[34:07] don't know well that would put her on
[34:12] the opposite side right because I see a
[34:15] tow I mean he'd have told her they were
[34:17] going down here going down here she
[34:19] might have had some ideas but she had no
[34:21] idea what he was talking about
[34:23] whatsoever and really in essence he
[34:26] didn't either because he's the one who
[34:29] said is he he left just believe in God
[34:33] get up and leave
[34:36] where would I go I'll tell you later
[34:39] that's the best answer that he could
[34:41] have got out of the whole thing right
[34:43] you get up and you start walking I'll
[34:45] let you know when you get to where
[34:48] you're supposed to be I'll tell you
[34:51] alright that's what we call faith that
[34:55] to me is what is faith see we look at
[34:57] faith is the substance of things hoped
[34:58] for the evidence of things not seen for
[35:00] five faith we've we want to put faith as
[35:02] some great thing and it is don't
[35:07] misunderstand
[35:08] but it starts in simply believing okay
[35:13] now if you don't get nothing out of the
[35:15] message today you get that that brother
[35:18] Dale believes in Abraham was not a
[35:21] born-again believer he didn't have a
[35:23] super-duper faith to start with his
[35:25] faith increased as he went on his
[35:29] journey and one day he even had so much
[35:34] faith in God till he took Isaac up and
[35:37] was gonna kill him I can't remember what
[35:40] he said in other words he plainly said
[35:42] said I got him from the dead and if I
[35:46] have to kill him
[35:47] I'll get him back he knew that see that
[35:50] was his faith all right see we we want
[35:54] to look for something big some
[35:57] outstanding miracle of style of form of
[36:01] what we call faith well that's all right
[36:05] I'm no problem is it I'm just saying
[36:07] that to me that's not the way it starts
[36:10] it starts by you simply believing and
[36:13] accepting what God says and walking
[36:17] forward all right and walk yourself into
[36:21] it or if the Prophet said confess
[36:22] yourself into it
[36:23] all right now those Old Testament Saints
[36:28] as I said look at him out of all the
[36:32] things I want to emphasize this part
[36:34] right here because it is an odd
[36:37] situation to say that for without us
[36:39] they could not be made perfect now we
[36:42] know there's I said the answer to that
[36:44] it is not sinless perfection it's not
[36:46] speaking of that he's talking about they
[36:49] were not complete there was something
[36:51] about those Old Testament Saints that
[36:53] was never brought into completion all
[36:56] right
[36:57] now first off they never received the
[36:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost so it was
[37:04] promised yeah
[37:06] this was promised that was promised but
[37:08] they never received it all right they
[37:13] were looking forward to it but never
[37:16] received that all right so they were not
[37:20] complete are you in it it's not saying
[37:27] that wasn't perfect see that's what we
[37:31] want to lay on to that point but no it's
[37:33] not complete they didn't finish the
[37:40] thing that it was set out for them to do
[37:42] so they were not complete all right now
[37:47] follow that point and get that emphases
[37:49] in mind but get it in mind this way this
[37:52] is what I want to drive it they get it
[37:55] into the point that they without us
[37:57] cannot be made complete but look back at
[38:02] what they done and what happened there
[38:10] right and you just keep reading Hebrews
[38:14] 11 how does this and that and this than
[38:16] that and no and then you know we've got
[38:19] over the r32 and he says now what could
[38:21] I say more of this one and that one and
[38:24] this one remember if they're waiting on
[38:29] you and I then we must have the goods to
[38:35] produce if we don't come forth with that
[38:39] then the Old Testament does not come
[38:44] forth I know you can go back and ice all
[38:48] right you you get into what you want to
[38:50] about this and out of the other oven you
[38:53] know just get in mind what I'm talking
[38:55] about if it's so marvelous of the things
[39:02] that they could do with simple faith
[39:05] what's the problem with us in the
[39:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[39:11] I'll just believe in God and just saying
[39:15] thank you and just walk right on my
[39:20] healing I get I get by confessing it and
[39:24] walk it into it the Lord has touched me
[39:27] and brought a lot of this out of the way
[39:28] of the congestion 'z and the things and
[39:31] all this at the other they wanted to
[39:32] whack here they want to cut tire they
[39:34] were the only we're still all just
[39:36] forget it but my point is one thing it's
[39:40] always been that way with me and I want
[39:44] you to do that
[39:45] confess your healing when you're totally
[39:51] sick when you're just into beyond all
[39:54] things of the mind or comprehension of
[39:57] thinking about being well see then we
[40:00] put that owner well now it would be
[40:02] faith now if I seen it work well now
[40:06] that's James and Paul arguing with each
[40:08] other
[40:09] right you understand what I mean James
[40:12] and Paul when one of them looks like
[40:14] it's this way and the other one looks
[40:15] like it's that way and the prophet of
[40:17] God said both of them said the same
[40:18] thing Paul saying it's by faith James
[40:25] said it's by works he didn't say it that
[40:28] way the works his faith expressed all
[40:33] right now are you following my point C
[40:36] then Paul could make a confession but
[40:41] his confession must be the same
[40:43] confession that James made it's just
[40:48] lack of understanding all right now so
[40:52] they both saying the same thing all
[40:54] right so now to say they without us
[40:56] cannot be made perfect now I'm gonna
[40:58] throw a cog in the wheel right here in a
[41:01] hurry now cause I'm gonna reverse it
[41:04] they without us could not be made
[41:06] perfect right us without them cannot be
[41:09] made perfect now maybe you'll get the
[41:12] meaning of the word complete okay come
[41:16] on we're gonna read in a little bit
[41:17] where the Prophet says the Old Testament
[41:20] spoke of the new the new spoke of the
[41:22] old alright
[41:24] now you're listening and falling with me
[41:26] on the thought the then they without us
[41:29] cannot be made perfect it will not come
[41:32] to a completion without us all right now
[41:39] us without them cannot attain unto the
[41:46] completion the Bible is speaking off so
[41:52] we've all emphasized and we keep their
[41:54] facade colors gray of putting the
[41:57] dependence of Israel in the Old
[41:59] Testament nothing like a as to be upon
[42:02] us in the new birth that we have and
[42:04] that's great
[42:06] but now maybe you ought to think a
[42:08] little bit about the point what that we
[42:15] can't be complete without them so it's
[42:21] not just something that we're looking at
[42:23] it in the wrong direction that's why I
[42:27] emphasize what I always do with book of
[42:29] Hebrews you can take the book of Hebrews
[42:32] the eleventh chapter you read it down
[42:34] and all of it at Old Testament to open
[42:36] them you can get the last few verses you
[42:38] can interrelate a little bit into the
[42:39] New Testament
[42:41] but just remember either way right
[42:47] because now remember they without us
[42:50] cannot be made perfect all right those
[42:54] down to the seven Church ages are in the
[42:59] grave waiting on you and I right so they
[43:07] without us cannot be made perfect or
[43:09] complete right see if they're waiting
[43:13] this is wealth so everything is
[43:15] dependent upon you and I too as brethren
[43:22] we'll read a minute to not fail god it's
[43:28] dependent upon you and I to come to a
[43:30] position of confessing and walking into
[43:32] it we know for a certainty what
[43:37] through the Old Testament they did not
[43:39] have the new birth so they did not have
[43:42] a glorified body so they didn't have
[43:45] those type of things back in that
[43:47] situation alright but they must come to
[43:51] a place some day they tell how to be
[43:53] raised it had to be brought forth but
[43:57] the New Testament Saints with the
[43:58] morning again experience they have the
[44:01] new BIR but what are they liking the
[44:03] same thing the Old Testament likes in
[44:05] the basis that the Old Testament needed
[44:08] a change of the body we need a change in
[44:11] the body right see that's the point that
[44:16] we need that's what those that are down
[44:18] Paul Peter James John anyone you know
[44:21] there in the grave waiting on you and I
[44:24] to bring them out of that grave and for
[44:29] them to be made complete because the New
[44:33] Testament is not complete until you come
[44:38] to a total glorified condition body
[44:41] spirit and soul then everything there
[44:44] there's nothing in completion it's
[44:47] waiting and that's the emphasis I wanted
[44:50] to put see to where that we don't get
[44:53] our minds build up
[44:54] oh it's waiting on us you know get some
[44:57] glorified point that we think about no
[45:01] because just remember we'll read these
[45:04] over and over when we're getting I know
[45:06] angle and get through today so I'm sorry
[45:08] I'll get it next week but just remember
[45:12] God's waiting on no no no God's not
[45:18] waiting on us now he can just do
[45:19] anything he wants to
[45:21] he can't go contrary to his word he
[45:24] can't change his mind so if he says he's
[45:29] waiting on us then he's waiting on us
[45:32] alright see that is putting more back
[45:36] into the right line of us instead of
[45:38] making it could be something oh boy look
[45:40] look how we are all that's waiting on us
[45:42] man
[45:43] man we're something now we just plain
[45:45] old starting off like we started with
[45:47] Abraham
[45:48] we just starting off by simple of faith
[45:52] simple point of faith to believe God
[45:58] faith just to believe God see then
[46:03] remember these as we go along will try
[46:05] to read it in background it to put it in
[46:07] but just remember my whole point
[46:12] God's waiting on you and I will quote it
[46:20] after a wild with the prophets you know
[46:22] we're God's waiting on you and I
[46:24] adoption time winning pouring its
[46:25] fullness and do this I come on we ain't
[46:27] lost off of them the message so don't
[46:30] get old you know shaky fide when I say
[46:32] something's a lot of times people don't
[46:34] understand it they get a little bit and
[46:36] you know you get to jitters so don't get
[46:39] to chitters I try to put the end of it
[46:41] on to start with so they won't get to
[46:43] jitters I'm not meaning what
[46:47] your mind is portraying in your thoughts
[46:50] that God is waiting on us well if he
[46:56] says yes why don't we believe why don't
[47:04] we take it to me then see now those Old
[47:07] Testament Saints look what they went
[47:10] through not even having the new birth
[47:19] then come on in to the new testament in
[47:23] looking at the new testament people and
[47:26] the things that have transpired in the
[47:28] new testament form by the warriors of
[47:31] faith in the new birth and see that
[47:35] still that new birth didn't make them
[47:41] totally complete so the Bible's right
[47:50] everybody's waiting on somebody right
[47:58] then after we settle the whole thing
[48:01] God's waiting on us now that that order
[48:06] make you think a little bit of trying to
[48:09] decide what we're here for
[48:15] worth of ones that the Bible said the
[48:18] end of all things has come upon us right
[48:24] right on down in Hebrews 12 or what it
[48:27] right through that we're getting about
[48:29] by such a great a cloud of witnesses
[48:35] those Old Testament Saints are waiting
[48:41] those New Testament Saints are waiting
[48:47] we're gathered about by so great a cloud
[48:50] of witnesses waiting on us no wonder the
[48:58] Bible says how long how long come on
[49:02] when are we gonna start realizing who we
[49:05] are what's taking place I've thoroughly
[49:09] enjoyed the last ministries of you know
[49:12] this come forth here too because they've
[49:15] all been into a basics of more back to
[49:18] the bride and getting to the bride to
[49:21] realize who she is and what we're here
[49:24] for and what's going on I've thoroughly
[49:27] enjoyed that because that thrills my
[49:29] soul I don't listen seed a lot of people
[49:32] listen and they missed the whole thing
[49:34] luckily he said so I wonder what he man
[49:36] he said cell phone what do you mean what
[49:38] do you mean oh I'm scared he might
[49:40] confuse me just sat down and listened
[49:47] and if he says something wrong said poop
[49:51] there goes the seat this makes her run
[49:54] run said be careful it is received
[49:57] but you understand what I mean I'm not
[50:01] worried about getting deceived I have
[50:06] never been worried about getting
[50:08] deceived
[50:11] I'm worried about being to see telling
[50:17] that's the difference in there so you
[50:20] can be deceived and be right in the
[50:22] middle of everything and walking in the
[50:24] light of the love of God but just
[50:26] missing it just enough the word that it
[50:29] can be a problem I have no fear about
[50:35] somebody coming in and getting in here
[50:38] and spreading some doctrine I don't fear
[50:46] that I fear what the problem is is what
[50:51] doctors we got that's why you ever
[50:57] notice I'll say it you know we're not
[50:59] this one and we're not Loula eyes you
[51:02] know so just be careful only my eyes
[51:05] they always got in trouble all right but
[51:08] listen we know for a certainty what
[51:15] we're looking for so I so make sure you
[51:18] follow the line and then we'll go
[51:19] through it we have the new birth
[51:24] you know the point again experience
[51:28] eternal life in your soul and your soul
[51:31] can never be lost can never be and it
[51:35] cannot be deceived it can be hindered
[51:38] hampered etc but cannot be deceived one
[51:43] because it's God living in you but yet
[51:47] still here today we're lacking lacking
[51:50] everything like in his life and lacking
[51:53] is I don't have it all right we're don't
[51:56] have it at the situation a lot of time
[51:59] right season what is it that we don't
[52:04] have but simple
[52:09] we don't have eternal life in these
[52:13] human vessels is that any problem if you
[52:17] think you have eternal life in your
[52:19] vessel now I ain't talking about
[52:20] born-again experience of the soul we
[52:23] explain that now I'm talking about your
[52:24] body if you think your body's already
[52:27] eternal and boy the devil don't bother
[52:30] me I've got he whooped you you already
[52:32] gone you ain't looking to be deceived
[52:35] you deceive to start with right now in
[52:42] doing that then those Old Testament
[52:46] people was looking for the new birth
[52:51] right because he didn't have it come on
[52:54] I'm dropping back pick up drop back pick
[52:56] up they didn't have the new birth so
[52:59] they were looking for the new birth the
[53:01] promise that is in Hebrews of the things
[53:05] that we said are that they fail to get
[53:07] that promise that promise was the new
[53:10] birth it was promised to Abraham to come
[53:16] forth and brat that would eventually
[53:20] come forth into reality right but they
[53:28] would come to a new birth because that
[53:31] was the very point of God coming to die
[53:33] to release his life to give up and to
[53:35] come into us all right see then they
[53:43] never received a new birth till they're
[53:47] waiting all right no seed not get over
[53:55] into the new testament we pick up the
[53:57] point is we're emphasizing a minute ago
[53:59] we now have the new birth in a soul but
[54:04] we're still not complete we're still not
[54:12] complete because we're not finished
[54:20] we need eternal life in this spirit room
[54:24] that we're in we need eternal I've in
[54:28] this natural human body room that we're
[54:30] in by the new birth we have eternal life
[54:34] in our soul and will not never be lost
[54:38] or anything but yet we're just not
[54:42] complete yet so now look at the Old
[54:47] Testament site children that were not
[54:48] complete look at you and I were standing
[54:52] here today not complete so we're still
[54:56] dependent upon something to take place
[55:00] right to take us to a glorified state in
[55:05] body and spirit to match our soul as to
[55:09] that point so we're waiting we're
[55:17] waiting we're in that position we're I
[55:19] don't know what would be called a hold
[55:20] position or what but you know we've
[55:25] tried to explain this for years about
[55:27] the dimensions and things and and you
[55:30] know you got your life lot in matter
[55:33] then you got your fourth dimension
[55:34] there's like TV and things like that
[55:35] fifth dimension is the center did and I
[55:38] never have understood that one because
[55:40] five is a good number
[55:42] you know these days I'm gonna ask a
[55:44] guard about that because that five
[55:47] number looks good but yet that's the
[55:51] center dated no is in the fifth
[55:55] dimension the sixth dimension according
[55:57] to the Prophet is the dimension - where
[56:01] you going beyond the curtain of time etc
[56:04] and he went beyond the curtain of time
[56:07] and saw peoples are in that dimension
[56:10] and in that dimension would cover all of
[56:13] those who would ever receive eternal
[56:15] life because they're put in a place of
[56:17] hold all right you realize that if you
[56:22] read revelations were in the five read
[56:26] revelations five some time with real
[56:28] clarity of your mind and thinking and
[56:30] think about the
[56:32] you'll see then that even though they
[56:35] are sitting there as the 24 elders
[56:38] gathered around the throne they're still
[56:41] not complete that's 12 apostles 12
[56:47] patriarchs that's the Old Testament
[56:49] that's the Nifty Testament that's all
[56:51] you want to do here and it's still not
[56:52] complete and what was it when brought
[56:56] around and went beyond the curtain of
[56:57] time he said must I go back there he
[57:02] didn't want to go that away right but
[57:07] those that had been there for a while
[57:08] we're longing to go back that's maybe
[57:13] hard we're thinking but is it true see
[57:16] brother Branham wanted to stay there he
[57:18] said do I have to go back he had reached
[57:21] a position that was really glorious to
[57:24] him but to those that was there they
[57:27] were saying how long how long in other
[57:31] words get something done and get us back
[57:32] over there we want to go back to our
[57:34] bodies so then just think of think with
[57:40] me about the point I'm trying to
[57:41] emphasize why would it be late relating
[57:44] always to say they without us brother
[57:50] dick always liked it this way he said
[57:52] Here I am today y'all perforates it but
[57:54] Here I am today really dick Addison he
[57:57] says well you know and I'm here they're
[58:00] waiting on us but if I die I'm waiting
[58:03] on them that's the point I see if I go
[58:06] on Python I'm waiting on you so get on
[58:10] with it that's the only thing that I've
[58:12] ever tried to say about anything that's
[58:14] all I've ever tried to preach always
[58:16] tried to preach one time hey let's get
[58:18] on with this thing let's don't fail is
[58:26] that what the prophets said about it he
[58:27] said God wanted this bride to realize
[58:31] that she wouldn't fall like Eve fell and
[58:35] that's something but I've got to point
[58:38] to you I hope we can get that back now
[58:41] later we'll do it next Sunday
[58:46] but for you to think about we can kind
[58:54] of comprehend the old testament waiting
[58:58] because they don't have the understand
[59:02] they're not a complete supposition new
[59:04] testament is not a complete position so
[59:08] there is a point their way but the
[59:11] hardest part is whatever reason I come
[59:13] to this point a few weeks ago and I
[59:15] wrote my notes and shut it down then I
[59:18] got to get to that because I've always
[59:21] emphasized and we've always said those
[59:24] things which you really think about how
[59:25] that God's waiting on you and I he's
[59:32] waiting on you and I then what's he
[59:36] waiting list to do some big supernatural
[59:42] thing some great big doing that's reason
[59:46] of enjoying these series waiters are
[59:48] doing about the revival because that's
[59:51] the way I've always believed it I've
[59:53] always believed that I've been in a
[59:55] revival ever since I come into this
[59:57] message no I've always been in a revival
[1:00:02] I've never had a position or a thought
[1:00:05] to worth it I was so down and out about
[1:00:07] the word now I have been down and out
[1:00:09] about you
[1:00:10] I've been down and out about me and all
[1:00:13] those things but I've never been down
[1:00:15] and out about the word never because as
[1:00:21] long as that word keeps on faith on
[1:00:24] unveiling I will never get tired of it
[1:00:31] right you talk about well I read this
[1:00:34] and I read that and one day I read it
[1:00:36] and it just jumped up off the page we'll
[1:00:38] see I believe the whole Bible is laying
[1:00:40] there like the haps you know I believe
[1:00:41] the whole message is laying there that
[1:00:43] away see I've never been down and out
[1:00:47] about the way things are going and in
[1:00:49] the world because now you know just be
[1:00:52] honest God always kept me and posted on
[1:00:54] to the future because you can argue what
[1:00:57] you want about it but he did because
[1:00:59] it's the I the first message I preached
[1:01:01] in this message was that the bride of
[1:01:04] Jesus Christ would be the son of man in
[1:01:08] the last days and that's what your
[1:01:09] prophet said so you can argue him now
[1:01:13] it's not a part of phrases and already
[1:01:16] it's directly the bride will be the son
[1:01:21] of man the Word made flesh so then what
[1:01:27] if I what what could I be down and out
[1:01:28] about anything the joy is to see
[1:01:32] somebody asked me one time said what how
[1:01:35] does it make you feel when you stood
[1:01:37] back there that was 1969 and you stood
[1:01:41] back there and said the bride would
[1:01:42] leave these on I said it doesn't build
[1:01:45] me up and great glorious hallelujahs and
[1:01:48] all this ever you know I've never
[1:01:50] reached that when we wrote a recommend
[1:01:52] spoken words original CDs in one of
[1:01:54] these quotes he said now I got a big
[1:01:56] hallelujah right there you know maybe
[1:01:59] I've never reached that point myself to
[1:02:00] get a great big hallelujah but at least
[1:02:02] I can get a few amens in my own self you
[1:02:05] know to believe in the word all right
[1:02:07] but listen Church to realize that God is
[1:02:14] depending upon us
[1:02:17] I don't worry about we got to know here
[1:02:22] we're brother Branham says he didn't
[1:02:24] complete what he came here for right he
[1:02:32] is left for the bride to complete it
[1:02:34] it's in the notes so keep the notes if
[1:02:37] you don't read them you have it
[1:02:39] but listen these they're depending now
[1:02:44] let's just drop back start over
[1:02:47] roof low and let's just see and we'll
[1:02:52] read what the prophet has to say to make
[1:02:54] sure this you you'll follow it so we'll
[1:02:56] have a number one brothers and we'll
[1:02:58] start this to pulling up some things and
[1:03:02] reading them this is taken from Elle
[1:03:06] Cheshire dick the great French sand King
[1:03:08] when we rallied our with Abraham no
[1:03:12] who's just on them when we rally there
[1:03:15] in other words we gather we rally we
[1:03:18] gather around you know with Abraham
[1:03:23] Isaac and Jacob those who were heirs of
[1:03:26] the promise right but now look looking
[1:03:34] forward to us not to fail for without us
[1:03:43] they cannot be made perfect just take
[1:03:47] that without analyzing without running
[1:03:49] your mind and trying to get all this
[1:03:51] figured out and gonna just take what
[1:03:53] I've just read and think about it
[1:03:55] just read it some were we're gonna rally
[1:04:00] together connect whatever you want to
[1:04:04] call the wordings are with Abraham Isaac
[1:04:07] and Jacob I think we already don't
[1:04:10] already had a good connection because of
[1:04:13] that we are the heirs of faith according
[1:04:14] to Abraham's faith I meant I brought
[1:04:17] that in while ago right and said looking
[1:04:20] forward they're looking forward to us
[1:04:24] not to fail well no okay for without us
[1:04:31] they cannot be made perfect and how
[1:04:35] they're depending on us this morning
[1:04:37] let's not fail keep your anchor in
[1:04:41] Christ
[1:04:42] now those Old Testament son
[1:04:47] they're waiting on you and I now don't
[1:04:55] flop your mind and get over drunk cause
[1:04:57] I've been through this
[1:04:58] and it's been priests and we've got it
[1:05:01] well I believe it's correct way and if
[1:05:04] you don't believe it that's all right
[1:05:05] see you say well some of the Old
[1:05:07] Testament Saints well I'll just put the
[1:05:10] Quietus to the whole thing you say the
[1:05:12] Old Testament Saints raised you be
[1:05:15] careful because he didn't always I'm in
[1:05:18] the Bible for you at because the Bible
[1:05:21] said all of them didn't rise right so
[1:05:27] I'm with the Bible so now where you at
[1:05:29] you say yeah but some of these raise
[1:05:31] here
[1:05:31] well I'd remind you of one thing
[1:05:37] you get over in the book of Acts I think
[1:05:40] it is and it's speaking there says in
[1:05:45] David's suppli Chur never how you
[1:05:48] pronounce to put told or ever you got a
[1:05:50] big words or grave grave right David's
[1:05:55] grave is with us till today now that's
[1:05:59] the book of Acts
[1:06:01] well surely I think David would been one
[1:06:03] of them that raised wouldn't you you
[1:06:08] know raised with the Lord Jesus
[1:06:10] but it says he's in the grave waiting on
[1:06:12] us let's see we don't read the Bible
[1:06:15] that away we want to read it as to what
[1:06:17] brother so-and-so said and that brother
[1:06:20] so-and-so go ahead and say what he wants
[1:06:22] to me I'm studying the Bible my parts
[1:06:27] just come out of that let's see that
[1:06:29] that's why people say well we want we
[1:06:31] want to get her let's get away from the
[1:06:33] quote in the profit let's get with a
[1:06:34] Bible come on
[1:06:35] I enjoy I enjoy the Bible and a big man
[1:06:43] standing up in front of a bunch of
[1:06:45] ministers one day and he said I can take
[1:06:48] the Bible and tire you to pieces
[1:06:50] I said well you said you wanted the
[1:06:55] Bible
[1:06:56] so come on I said we'll meet you
[1:07:01] anywhere you want to be met
[1:07:03] I wouldn't bragging trying to be nice I
[1:07:06] was just telling the truth it was on
[1:07:09] marriage and divorce and I said we're
[1:07:12] gonna take the Bible and see what it
[1:07:16] says well you know what we never made a
[1:07:19] meeting okay I'm not bragging just
[1:07:25] telling it truth and you throw it back
[1:07:27] in somebody's face and they say well
[1:07:29] give me this I won't the Bible so okay
[1:07:30] that's what I want now you got them at a
[1:07:34] disadvantage okay but now listen they're
[1:07:39] depending on us this morning let's not
[1:07:45] fail those Old Testament signs they're
[1:07:53] waiting on us let's don't fail that okay
[1:07:56] go ahead number two this is taken from
[1:07:59] glorified Jesus how that those Old
[1:08:03] Testament Saints are looking now without
[1:08:08] us they are not perfect so they're
[1:08:12] depending on us to believe God's Word
[1:08:23] now they're too
[1:08:25] us to believe God's Word now I'm gonna
[1:08:31] say it in the hard way but if it's true
[1:08:33] that a revival is a revival of the word
[1:08:37] and not the great signs and wonders and
[1:08:40] everybody's looked for a revival to be
[1:08:44] all right and I believe that's true
[1:08:47] okay well then wouldn't it be that the
[1:08:54] Bible would be the revelation of Jesus
[1:08:58] Christ
[1:09:01] given to us with the new birth to be
[1:09:09] able to connect to those Old Testament
[1:09:11] Saints and in some way have to do with
[1:09:17] their resurrection are you thinking
[1:09:25] those Old Testament signs
[1:09:27] they're not gonna raise without us oh
[1:09:29] Jesus done that no we'll get in the
[1:09:33] Bible is gonna say Jesus done when Jesus
[1:09:36] raised the Bible says many of them right
[1:09:37] but it didn't say all of them and
[1:09:43] brother Branham emphasizing in the way
[1:09:45] that he'll bring it out he'll bring
[1:09:47] Abraham and all of them as the Old
[1:09:49] Testament Saints we just got through
[1:09:51] reading that now follow it go ahead to
[1:09:59] the next one perfection which would be
[1:10:04] number three perfection wonderful
[1:10:10] shadows of the faith not talking about
[1:10:14] the Old Testament people the heroes hero
[1:10:17] he of faith how by faith they did such
[1:10:23] and such a thing and how without us they
[1:10:28] could not be made perfect because they
[1:10:31] are of the shadow of this to come
[1:10:39] there are the shadow shadow is not a
[1:10:44] reality the things they done in the Old
[1:10:49] Testament is covered in types and
[1:10:51] shadows
[1:10:52] speaking of us right so then what's it
[1:10:59] saying they could not be made complete
[1:11:04] because they were living in the shadow
[1:11:11] and that's why Paul said that they died
[1:11:16] in the faith for not receiving the
[1:11:21] promise they never got the promise of
[1:11:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in an Old
[1:11:28] Testament people I know see I I bring
[1:11:31] that out and I I realize that some to
[1:11:33] some people that's a new thought but you
[1:11:36] think about it Jesus Christ had not died
[1:11:39] back there and you can't how the death
[1:11:43] though you can't have the Testament
[1:11:44] without the death of the testator I'm
[1:11:46] quoting scripture so I'm not throwing
[1:11:50] off on those people and put them in the
[1:11:52] right position they're waiting on you
[1:11:56] and I because they are of the shadow the
[1:12:03] shadows not a reality okay go to number
[1:12:06] four make a new clock of Aaron I can
[1:12:12] even tell time then okay what was the
[1:12:18] Holy Ghost giving same holy spirit that
[1:12:22] saved the Lutheran's they sanctified the
[1:12:26] method Methodist that baptized the
[1:12:29] Pentecostal is now sitting in order to
[1:12:32] coming of the Lord Jesus when it'll be
[1:12:35] so powerful that body will come into
[1:12:38] this group of church that will draw the
[1:12:41] rest of them from the grave
[1:12:43] there'll be a resurrection that's what
[1:12:46] the Holy Ghost is far as resurrect
[1:12:50] now watch him what is the Holy Ghost
[1:12:54] Lucy you say well it's this a you're not
[1:12:57] listening to what he's saying he's
[1:12:58] putting his point back here that's what
[1:13:01] the Holy Ghost was far there will be a
[1:13:03] resurrection the his relation is back up
[1:13:06] here you're just relating what is the
[1:13:09] Holy Ghost without us without now may I
[1:13:18] see it what is the whole ego without
[1:13:20] someone with the Holy Ghost those prior
[1:13:25] who lived in another day and lived under
[1:13:28] that day they cannot come forth
[1:13:31] oh come on brother Dale God just go out
[1:13:37] into the grave said God was right no no
[1:13:40] he can't do that I'm sorry
[1:13:44] and the reason he can't do that is cause
[1:13:46] he said he wouldn't do it right I mean
[1:13:51] it's not that he can't because he can
[1:13:54] but he says it and then when he said
[1:13:57] that his word is binding him to the
[1:13:59] point that it has to come a certain way
[1:14:01] so what's it saying as I said to one
[1:14:05] there'll be a resurrection that's what
[1:14:07] the Holy Ghost is far the Holy Ghost is
[1:14:10] the resurrection it's the life of Jesus
[1:14:12] Christ is eternal life oh now watch him
[1:14:14] what is the Holy Ghost without us they
[1:14:20] could not be made perfect without the
[1:14:23] Holy Ghost that's in you there's the New
[1:14:28] Testament bride coming forth with the
[1:14:29] Holy Spirit dwelling within her without
[1:14:32] that Holy Spirit dwelling in that New
[1:14:33] Testament bride those Old Testament
[1:14:36] Saints can't come forward because they
[1:14:40] don't have the Holy Ghost to match it
[1:14:44] right
[1:14:47] said don't don't just emphasize a point
[1:14:49] to where you say well God can do what he
[1:14:51] wants to he can't break his word he
[1:14:59] can't change his mind about his word
[1:15:02] when he said it that's the way it's
[1:15:05] going to be when when that first get
[1:15:11] many years ago 40 years ago my brother
[1:15:14] ran him on the adoption Siri said the
[1:15:19] whole world was waiting on the
[1:15:23] manifestation of the sons and daughters
[1:15:25] of God I had a future to look forward to
[1:15:35] but you see I've never believed brother
[1:15:38] Branham was looking to the future
[1:15:40] like most thing he was looking to the
[1:15:44] present tense I've always appreciated a
[1:15:47] way and that's where I believe it a
[1:15:48] born-again believer is not looking to
[1:15:51] the future they're looking at present
[1:15:53] tense looking to the future is fine
[1:15:55] that's alright we'll get there one each
[1:15:56] day but see that's a Baptist one day
[1:15:59] when we get to heaven we go have eternal
[1:16:02] life you wouldn't in the Baptist Church
[1:16:04] so you wouldn't the you said well what
[1:16:09] didn't I I never did understand what
[1:16:10] they were talking about because I
[1:16:12] thought they were talking about did I
[1:16:13] get eternal life but see there's it
[1:16:17] always somewheres else out under by the
[1:16:19] way we wouldn't run around them come
[1:16:20] forth he never spoke of a past I'm sure
[1:16:29] he did because he told what happened he
[1:16:32] never spoke of a future sure he did
[1:16:34] because there is prophecies but brother
[1:16:36] Browns whole message is present tense
[1:16:41] maybe you never thought it in that room
[1:16:44] its present tense to him it was right
[1:16:49] dark I'm not saying he's coming
[1:16:58] I'm saying he's here is that a quote
[1:17:01] that what he said he said then we get
[1:17:07] into trouble looking at the pies we get
[1:17:11] into trouble looking at the future
[1:17:13] he said we fail to see what's taking
[1:17:16] place see that's what I'm hoping and
[1:17:19] praying because I've prayed for that
[1:17:22] ever since I've been in the message for
[1:17:24] people to get the revival that the
[1:17:26] revivals me could have always believed
[1:17:28] in a revival always have always believed
[1:17:30] I was in a revival do you say well I
[1:17:35] don't care it doesn't make nothing out
[1:17:38] of me I'm just saying what it is I've
[1:17:40] always looked it's something taking
[1:17:43] place and see that's why I couldn't get
[1:17:50] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost because
[1:17:51] I couldn't find it in the basis of it
[1:17:53] happening that one day brother Modi said
[1:17:57] stop what you're doing he said look to
[1:18:02] the promise that he said it and you
[1:18:03] believe it there it was that's all it
[1:18:11] took because he I found something
[1:18:14] positive there's no such thing as
[1:18:18] negative ISM in the gospel everything is
[1:18:23] positive oh we look back we look forward
[1:18:28] yes but what did the prophets say that
[1:18:30] that was our problem looking back or
[1:18:32] looking forward instead of looking at
[1:18:34] present tense
[1:18:35] now listen so what do you say they lived
[1:18:42] in one day okay excuse me where's that
[1:18:49] one number four we're still on it called
[1:18:52] I read part of it didn't you
[1:18:53] go back to number four yeah what is the
[1:18:57] Holy Ghost without us they cannot be
[1:18:59] made perfect they lived in one day under
[1:19:02] that we live in another day when the
[1:19:05] enemy comes in like a flood all the
[1:19:08] Spirit of God will raise up a standard
[1:19:09] again
[1:19:10] see they lived in another day as we keep
[1:19:15] looking back see then we're going to die
[1:19:22] and not achieve what God has purposed
[1:19:26] for us to do I don't mean to be
[1:19:32] sarcastic I don't mean to be hateful but
[1:19:33] I mean to tell the truth when God showed
[1:19:36] me that years ago and you know its own
[1:19:38] type for 40 years I've made this
[1:19:41] statement that God showed me that the
[1:19:44] biggest portion of people this message
[1:19:46] would die and go by the grave and I had
[1:19:50] no reference then none today of it being
[1:19:54] any problem against the fact except one
[1:19:56] thing they will not accept what the word
[1:19:59] says about him that's all I was
[1:20:02] referencing that's all God but he showed
[1:20:05] me said they won't be able to attain
[1:20:07] unto it bodily change you can argue what
[1:20:17] you want to you can say what he didn't
[1:20:18] tell you no problem I tell you I saw God
[1:20:24] not 11 years old you do what you want it
[1:20:27] ain't no argument i neva arguing nobody
[1:20:30] about it house there and see if we stay
[1:20:39] in another day then why can we expect
[1:20:44] God to move it at least move whatever
[1:20:48] we're doing move have some joy about it
[1:20:52] you know I mean if you think it's going
[1:20:55] to be this certain way have a joy about
[1:20:58] it being that way I am I'm happy about
[1:21:02] it going like it's going you know I've
[1:21:09] always been crazy too you know when they
[1:21:11] were saying well Hilary is gonna make it
[1:21:13] to profit I don't care if they put
[1:21:15] Hilary and another woman in there and he
[1:21:17] ain't got nothin to do with me
[1:21:23] but I'm happy about what God has
[1:21:26] revealed to me over the years that he's
[1:21:30] kept it to the basis that nobody hasn't
[1:21:33] been able to come in here and tear it
[1:21:35] down now if you show me in a sea well
[1:21:38] we've had a couple left though they
[1:21:40] didn't didn't like you we had one to
[1:21:42] leave to you still today got a letter
[1:21:45] ain't nothing against the doctors or
[1:21:47] nothing I'm just gonna find me a note
[1:21:48] pastor okay okay
[1:21:55] make your mind up and do what you want
[1:21:57] to do let's see we've tried to do one
[1:22:03] thing to stay with the word well let's
[1:22:09] see if I can get I still want to go so
[1:22:12] far okay let's get this and for certain
[1:22:15] number five the stature of a perfect man
[1:22:19] you get it these people who died in here
[1:22:22] now he's coming up to the New Testament
[1:22:24] okay it's reading I'm wanting to bring
[1:22:26] this up then we went through the Old
[1:22:28] Testament given the quote star of it how
[1:22:30] others laying in there and all if you
[1:22:32] want them but now we're gonna pick up to
[1:22:34] the New Testament form cuz listen to it
[1:22:37] you get it these people who died in here
[1:22:40] statue a perfect man or depending and
[1:22:43] waiting on us okay so this church has
[1:22:47] got to come to perfection completion
[1:22:51] finished in order to bring the
[1:22:53] resurrection and they're under sold
[1:22:56] under the altar waiting for this church
[1:22:58] to come to its perfection that when
[1:23:02] Christ does come go ahead
[1:23:06] how much the church now it's come up to
[1:23:10] a needle point until the church in the
[1:23:13] minority has got to get into a place
[1:23:16] until it's the same kind of a ministry
[1:23:18] that this left because when this
[1:23:21] headstone comes back it's got a little
[1:23:25] pocket life here where it's going to sit
[1:23:27] right in there on the regular fare meze
[1:23:30] on it's just isn't a count right on that
[1:23:34] sits across the top it's a little flat
[1:23:37] and it's got to sit on there and cause
[1:23:39] it sheds the water and when it comes
[1:23:41] this church has got to be honed all
[1:23:44] these rest the stones in the pyramid
[1:23:47] laying so perfectly until you can't run
[1:23:49] a razor blade up through here what
[1:23:51] appear mid-cap dusk when the pyramid cap
[1:23:53] does come the pyramid itself the body of
[1:23:57] Christ will have to be honed not only
[1:24:00] just some creed or doctrine or something
[1:24:02] other we come through it'll have to be
[1:24:05] so perfectly like Christ till when he
[1:24:08] comes he and that ministry will fit
[1:24:11] right smack together see then will come
[1:24:14] the rapture they're going home you say
[1:24:19] well what a brother Dale if you always
[1:24:21] look for that right there I've always
[1:24:25] looked for one thing for the people of
[1:24:29] this message to become alive in what
[1:24:33] they are hearing and what's transpiring
[1:24:36] and then it'll start a revival not
[1:24:39] moving not us going over here and
[1:24:41] running and doing I believe in that too
[1:24:43] that's good
[1:24:44] I love it but what is it a revival of
[1:24:48] the opening of God's Word
[1:24:54] do you see where I can stand and say
[1:24:57] 1969 when everybody else was saying this
[1:25:01] out of the other I said the brown of
[1:25:03] Jesus Christ according to the prophet
[1:25:05] will be the Son of Man the Son of Man is
[1:25:12] the Word made flesh not in one person
[1:25:17] its intent into our body me I don't mean
[1:25:23] this in disrespect I mean in truth
[1:25:25] so you say well we're waiting on that
[1:25:27] all right when we got to get that here
[1:25:29] then how do we do it
[1:25:33] I'm not sarcastic I'm telling it the
[1:25:37] best way I can tell it if you're saying
[1:25:39] there's got to be this or this person or
[1:25:41] that thing to happen then let's get on
[1:25:43] with getting that here well how you can
[1:25:48] do that pray and study your Bible is
[1:25:53] that the only way the Prophet said we
[1:25:54] can get anything quit looking at the
[1:26:00] Pais and don't look at the future would
[1:26:03] look at what's taking place well I don't
[1:26:07] see that there's for the part I don't
[1:26:09] see nothing if you're standing here in
[1:26:13] the book of Acts
[1:26:15] you wouldn't say you'd say that I don't
[1:26:18] see nothing because I've made a
[1:26:19] challenge to people it's kind of funny
[1:26:21] to think about take the book of Acts and
[1:26:24] write down how many miracles happen in
[1:26:27] the book of Acts and take this church
[1:26:33] over the 50 years of the book of Acts
[1:26:37] those are somewhere in our 40 something
[1:26:39] years right
[1:26:39] that you have to count calculate so far
[1:26:42] back here of say 30 years we'll just put
[1:26:44] 30 years and we can write off miracles
[1:26:50] that took place as many you understand
[1:26:57] now see it's not looking in the wrong
[1:26:59] read when brother Branham made that
[1:27:00] statement he says there's more miracles
[1:27:03] in one service than his written in the
[1:27:08] book of Acts or maybe he said in the
[1:27:12] Bible
[1:27:12] oh no you put that in number I think you
[1:27:14] spoke about some about his own ministry
[1:27:16] right one service more than in the book
[1:27:23] of Acts twenty thirty thousand
[1:27:32] outstanding miracles twenty thirty
[1:27:35] thousand conversions in one altar call
[1:27:40] the book of Acts don't even stand a
[1:27:43] chance I don't mean that wrong I mean it
[1:27:45] in the right side I was telling you to
[1:27:47] what you're looking at you read the book
[1:27:49] of Acts you read you hear the Prophet
[1:27:51] about these great things all right
[1:27:52] wonderful but just look around sometime
[1:28:00] just calculate I wish little brother
[1:28:02] Gary Atkins were still here because he
[1:28:04] would intended to do that one day he was
[1:28:06] intended to write down all of the
[1:28:08] outstanding things that had taken place
[1:28:10] and and we'd have them you know just a
[1:28:17] little church we've seen the dead raised
[1:28:18] to see he'll we've seen everything but
[1:28:20] blinded eyes open we've seen them to a
[1:28:22] point but we've seen everything that you
[1:28:26] could speak of in the book of Acts
[1:28:28] healings and signs and wonders right
[1:28:30] here in among us just a little group
[1:28:32] here do we believe that well you know
[1:28:35] I'm tickled to death when I get healed I
[1:28:37] don't know how you feel when I'm sick
[1:28:39] and things are going wrong and God comes
[1:28:42] on the scene I don't care I don't care
[1:28:44] who does the praying I just want
[1:28:47] somebody to contact God right we've got
[1:28:54] a woman a preacher down there work that
[1:28:56] you know I mean God here priors Rai
[1:28:59] didn't care to go tell her I say now
[1:29:01] we've got some problem in the church
[1:29:03] we've got a couple of people too sick
[1:29:04] would you pray for I didn't bother me
[1:29:06] you mean you'd go to a woman preacher
[1:29:08] and ask her to pray yes siree I'd go to
[1:29:13] the Pope of Rome and ask him to pray
[1:29:16] because I believe he could be anointed
[1:29:18] and touch God
[1:29:19] that's just how dumb I guess I am I
[1:29:22] believe that we're living in a day when
[1:29:24] the greatest of all things has ever
[1:29:26] taken place is here it's not coming is
[1:29:29] here I believe that we're a present
[1:29:31] tense in the greatest revival that has
[1:29:33] ever been the only said making make you
[1:29:36] mad at me I've been looking for this 40
[1:29:39] years praying about it for 40 years or
[1:29:41] more talking about a revival because
[1:29:45] I've always had that in my heart a
[1:29:47] revival of God's Word
[1:29:52] they don't revive you for God to to
[1:29:55] speak to you about his you you know and
[1:29:59] tell you something from the Bible yeah
[1:30:05] these little kids can tell you sometimes
[1:30:08] ask them sometimes
[1:30:11] some of them might be able to tell us
[1:30:13] some things about healing
[1:30:17] come on musician I'll pick it up next
[1:30:22] week we'll try to go on from there but
[1:30:24] just remember what we've covered now
[1:30:25] we've covered the Old Testament trying
[1:30:27] to bring that up and seeing it will back
[1:30:29] up review and then we'll go to the New
[1:30:31] Testament but then where I want to get
[1:30:33] to that point that God is waiting on you
[1:30:37] and I so that'll show you exactly where
[1:30:42] I've hated where I've been headed for 50
[1:30:44] years where I've been that pastor in a
[1:30:47] church here 40-something years and been
[1:30:49] looking for one thing not a world wide
[1:30:52] sweeping revival never looked for a
[1:30:56] world wide thought I could read your
[1:30:58] prophet said that's not what it is but a
[1:31:04] word revival a revival in our hearts
[1:31:09] about what God has revealed to us that
[1:31:15] don't get that don't make you feel good
[1:31:18] within to realize and know that God has
[1:31:20] placed within you and I the greatest
[1:31:23] opportunity because everything from your
[1:31:26] back is waiting on us and I'm gonna say
[1:31:30] at the best way that I can understand it
[1:31:31] and if God's waiting on us then he ain't
[1:31:34] back there I'm gonna say it right so
[1:31:38] you'll understand when I was referencing
[1:31:40] the God waiting on you and I he's not
[1:31:42] back under waiting on you and I he's out

[1:36:38] you're a liar cause you can't do it that
[1:36:42] away you're trying to prop up something
[1:36:47] Abraham don't fit nowhere and die
[1:36:50] abraham believed God and just walked out
[1:36:54] on what he said wouldn't it be something
[1:36:58] if you go home and walk in the house and
[1:37:02] tell you why I say pack the duds we're
[1:37:07] leaving
[1:37:09] where we're going I don't know who we're
[1:37:16] leaving and I wouldn't blame any of you
[1:37:21] sisters for saying hey at least you
[1:37:24] could find out the destination well we
[1:37:28] could pack clothes for it either winter
[1:37:30] or summer or whatever you know no just
[1:37:35] walk out and say thank you
[1:37:39] we'll see you it's hard to put your
[1:37:42] confidence in a something like that when
[1:37:44] you ask God about something asking
[1:37:47] believing believing in and they say
[1:37:53] thank you I thank you Lord for my
[1:38:00] healing
[1:38:02] thank you for my deliverance for this

[1:38:13] going on their trip when this job be
[1:38:16] going probably almost two months or

[1:38:28] for this day and the opportunity that
[1:38:30] we've had we pray the things that we've
[1:38:32] said it has been according to you if not

[1:38:41] you're right here now with us you're
[1:38:46] manifesting yourself among the little
[1:38:48] bride around the world
[1:38:49] and all we got to do is just believe it
[1:38:53] help us to be at least like Abraham that
[1:38:55] could take it against our hope and
[1:38:58] believe that it packs from hope into
[1:39:01] revelation and then we're all in a
[1:39:04] reality
[1:39:06] goddess nad will go either natural me or
