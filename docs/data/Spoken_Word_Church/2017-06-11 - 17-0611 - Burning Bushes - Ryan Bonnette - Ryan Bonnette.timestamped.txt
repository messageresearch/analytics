[0:00] ow
[0:05] okay everybody see my burning bush much
[0:18] the burning bush turn out like this
[0:24] okay so what I want to talk to you about
[0:26] is burning bush it's the importance of
[0:29] having a place that you make along with
[0:32] God and regular basis you all know how
[0:35] important that is so I'm just
[0:37] reiterating with Jordan oh thank you duo
[0:41] in a magnifying let me up come on tell
[0:45] you yeah
[0:46] go away it's tough but you can do it
[0:49] again I just got one word a few words
[0:52] just for illustration
[1:02] not that
[1:04] don't go through this enough
[1:08] they're going to hate that
[1:09] [Music]
[1:11] this is for pandemic this for pandemic I
[1:14] made up that poor ray or what happens
[1:18] typically to all of that I say what's
[1:21] going on is we tend to pitch for
[1:23] everything back to the last personal
[1:25] prayer ministers say that that you know
[1:27] you tend to pitch for folks maybe the
[1:30] good things but also when you hear bad
[1:32] things brought out the Bible's our
[1:34] nature we tend to say well that's
[1:35] somebody else that's not me all right
[1:37] pitchfork pandemic an epidemic
[1:40] [Applause]
[1:41] well pandemic is an epidemic over a wide
[1:45] area exist everywhere
[1:46] okay so nobody's really excluded
[1:49] epidemic is a widespread outbreak of
[1:52] infectious disease many people aren't
[1:55] saved at the same time we call extends
[1:58] you can call it whatever but the fact is
[2:00] it's an infection you can call it also
[2:02] like slumbering you know we're
[2:04] descriptions were experience lick
[2:06] sometimes and the Lord has congratulate
[2:08] waking us up you know bring us to the
[2:10] reality of seeing what's going on I know
[2:12] brother Darryl is preaching and while he
[2:14] preached and he said if two groups of
[2:16] people in our church okay and this is
[2:18] happening everywhere I think that there
[2:21] are some who are catching what's
[2:22] happening what's going on and where
[2:24] they're at and some people who are just
[2:26] totally asleep spiritually nothing wrong
[2:28] with that person mentally it's just the
[2:30] fact they have to open up yet
[2:31] spiritually to catch what's happening it
[2:34] has one of the real situation here with
[2:37] a lot of things that they were taking
[2:39] about a champion rapture that we will
[2:41] miss if we don't catch our name and see
[2:43] what's happening okay
[2:44] waking up spirit and way to do that and
[2:48] Bernie book a purple okay not only that
[2:53] but that's a big part of it
[2:57] so all in consideration in the Bible is
[3:00] basically two people right or too
[3:02] careful you have dollar and math all
[3:04] right and where the land part where the
[3:06] humans are so really we have to consider
[3:08] everything in the Bible that still
[3:10] retains up is that so it's risen to its
[3:12] relative and kind so don't teach forty
[3:15] back similar to go to man I go to
[3:17] somebody else because you're female
[3:19] being okay
[3:25] so we know what we're talking about and
[3:29] everybody that's really small and you'll
[3:32] see that migrated perforating the big
[3:35] smile it's not just looking at Pizza
[3:39] head
[3:40] we're creating a big mountain know ye
[3:42] not that the unrighteous shall not
[3:44] inherit the kingdom of God be not
[3:46] deceived neither fornicators nor
[3:47] idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate
[3:49] nor abusers of themselves with mankind
[3:51] nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards
[3:54] nor revilers nor extortioners shall
[3:56] inherit the kingdom of God we'll all
[3:58] serve this emphasizing such were some of
[4:00] you but you're lost which ye are
[4:02] sanctified as you're justified in the
[4:03] name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit
[4:06] of our God
[4:06] my question is can you be sure that
[4:09] those things don't still apply to you
[4:11] are you sure that you've been washed
[4:14] sanctified justified you may be Lord
[4:16] Jesus Christ okay because to me if you
[4:20] ever come to a position where you stop
[4:22] and you don't continue on with God
[4:24] you're backslidden or they'll always say
[4:26] not contain will for if you stop then
[4:29] you're not moving on God your back foot
[4:30] so better come to a state where you say
[4:32] I'll wait on that last thing to come and
[4:34] we are but if we're not ready when that
[4:36] last state comes in and through the code
[4:39] so the fact is you have to continue
[4:41] progressing don't ever stop okay that's
[4:45] what I tell all the tarps on never stop
[4:47] seeing gothis been my life theme for
[4:48] twenty years I gave a heart Florida 12
[4:50] years old and at 15 I set out on a
[4:53] journey three miles every day contained
[4:55] a sick dog for there wanted more of you
[4:57] destroy the church you know one more
[4:58] than just you know just a basic
[5:00] Christian life that normally don't say
[5:02] anymore
[5:03] and
[5:04] dangerous never stop
[5:13] same Corinthians 11:3 but I fear lest by
[5:15] any means as the serpent beguiled Eve
[5:17] through his subtlety so your minds
[5:21] should be corrupted from the simplicity
[5:23] that it been from I love that first for
[5:26] part of note in your simplicity one
[5:29] thousand example hides and subtlety
[5:32] crossbodies complicity in both cases you
[5:35] see that nothing spiritual is real
[5:37] obvious to the flesh there's no big
[5:39] spiritual billboard with flashing so you
[5:41] know this is daughter this is the devil
[5:43] it's all very almost undetectable to the
[5:47] flesh and the Bible doesn't refer to
[5:50] Christ that throw a settlement wise
[5:52] deception right so the vowel or for us
[5:55] to Satan when certain is so because he's
[5:58] a deceiver but he works in our members
[6:01] and solty also because he actually hide
[6:04] in that way and deception so much that
[6:07] we sometimes don't even detect we don't
[6:09] even know he's working and then Bryce -
[6:12] simplicity so much that you can't
[6:14] realize sometimes that he's working
[6:16] under lock and you'll overlook something
[6:17] that's great to have him here I just
[6:19] think that was just blinking really
[6:22] think about spiritual things and
[6:25] although I thought this just this way
[6:26] look God has supposedly often fail to
[6:28] detect the devil in this little device
[6:38] too often we get hung up or discouraged
[6:40] from studying the use excuses like these
[6:43] and I've done lobby okay sir all my
[6:45] students origin timing media because the
[6:48] past nature are not saying not
[6:50] condescending or anything would you say
[6:52] some people will say I'm too dumb to
[6:53] understand you know the seven seals the
[6:56] great big deep thing is a domestic some
[6:58] people I understand that's the white
[6:59] rock I have for reading homer and that's
[7:02] been one of my biggest thing hold on I
[7:04] can read a whole page is something not
[7:06] taking anymore about it when I'm done to
[7:08] my started so I have to go back and
[7:10] reread and reread and reread yeah
[7:12] sometimes I'll read the Bible chapter
[7:14] two my daily reason I'll just hope I'll
[7:16] realize halfway through and I didn't get
[7:18] anything so I buy your service now our
[7:21] duty is to read studying make ourselves
[7:23] available to him to ability and plugs to
[7:26] both of these things so your two dollars
[7:29] say you have full reading comprehension
[7:30] okay Bobby you just keep keep studying
[7:33] it takes too much time
[7:35] well it does take time you have to spend
[7:37] time o'clock okay we don't get instant
[7:39] gratification but we found said not to
[7:43] say too much I get confused as to why
[7:46] people get hung up on that because I
[7:48] can't find what he said not to say all
[7:50] right I don't know where brother bang
[7:51] said not to study and I literally been
[7:54] hit he said this is from question answer
[7:57] is 54 or 3:00 in the morning
[7:59] now I meant that people study too much
[8:01] and try to get too far ahead and try to
[8:03] think too hard and sometimes that mental
[8:05] breakdowns and thing on account of
[8:07] studying about the Lord he must quit
[8:10] that okay you don't have to do that the
[8:13] only thing you have to do is fall in
[8:14] love with him and just go right on
[8:16] loving and then it's not trying to push
[8:18] into something to make yourself
[8:20] something you're not just go ahead and
[8:21] let God use you and lay officer
[8:23] is yield yourself to mentor self and
[8:26] walk on happy singing endorsing that's
[8:27] the way and so he said must quit that
[8:32] quit what commentator things out time to
[8:34] reason about the work done just keep
[8:36] studying though I don't think he's gonna
[8:37] stop say frankly if there is such a
[8:39] thing that's reading too much I don't
[8:41] think we have to worry about their name
[8:45] jam with my school time
[8:46] I've done be lumber three months we just
[8:52] don't stop I do fall in love with you
[8:54] know brother Chris long you came
[8:55] creature from months ago Arlo the way he
[8:57] previously said about doing everything
[9:00] with you he said you don't have to but
[9:03] you'll want to you don't have to you
[9:05] know rebound praying dumb jerk but you
[9:08] want to and the Lord doesn't need us but
[9:10] he wants them his below there is a Pope
[9:13] from us we put a watch to fall in love
[9:15] with someone you must get to know that
[9:17] you must read the love letter okay
[9:19] suppose I were talking about missus you
[9:22] have any anymore just almost something
[9:25] after a lovely and time will tell so the
[9:30] objective and lesson today is to see the
[9:33] importance of having a proper place
[9:34] where you meet with God our regular
[9:36] basis have fellowship or commune with
[9:39] him
[9:43] so I think this is the picture by the
[9:45] band was referring to when he talked
[9:47] often about that artist painting where
[9:49] the the door handle is on the inside and
[9:52] they're like 3:20 says the holistic door
[9:55] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[9:57] the door I will come in to him and will
[10:00] sup with Nana me to paint so this is
[10:03] something that were promoting this is on
[10:06] your part prices they're ready to come
[10:08] into you in Suffolk you I will come in
[10:11] to him living in Wellington in you but
[10:15] your job is open the door
[10:17] I simply do that by bowring prayer from
[10:20] the church but some sermons always okay
[10:26] so there are 29 playing on other go
[10:29] folks a lot see secret things belong to
[10:32] the Lord our God but those things which
[10:34] are revealed belong to us to our
[10:36] children forever the way we might do all
[10:38] the words of this vault okay so there's
[10:41] a great fountain in illis fountain of
[10:45] wisdom and revelation understanding
[10:46] knowledge and it's super waiting for us
[10:48] to tap into it okay it's always there
[10:51] price is almost there tree of the
[10:53] knowledge of good and evil in the tree
[10:54] of life are always traveling available
[10:57] you just tap into it we don't have to
[11:01] deceive knowledge in English
[11:03] into the tree of life the regular basis
[11:07] Matthew 6:6 the Zhou wen now press enter
[11:11] into thy closet and when thou hast shut
[11:12] thy door pray to thy father which is in
[11:15] secret and thy father which seeth in
[11:17] secret shall reward thee openly Young
[11:27] Lions to lack and suffer hunger abated
[11:30] seek the Lord shall not want
[11:32] any good thing there's that say sign
[11:36] home or a fine car may that's cries what
[11:39] would be about any good thing what would
[11:41] that be to God eternal life right
[11:43] there's no good or say no better thing
[11:45] on the account no perspectives then the
[11:49] best thing to give you eternal life a
[11:51] more of a standing account is working so
[11:54] you're not walking look laughing good
[11:56] thing it'll be there he's always there
[11:58] ready you just tap into that and you'll
[12:02] not be you know like songs might rip it
[12:04] up shall not want
[12:06] write any good thing it will not put
[12:09] selfish things in that but that's not
[12:11] what not talking about Psalm 27 for one
[12:16] thing I have desired of the Lord that
[12:18] will I see after that I may dwell in the
[12:20] house little all the days of my life to
[12:23] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[12:24] enquire in his temple 1.78 when now said
[12:29] sneak be my faith my heart said to me
[12:31] like race or philosophy
[12:38] this is the multi reading of second
[12:41] chapter of Philippians if there be
[12:43] therefore any consolation in prices any
[12:46] Concord of laws or any fellowship of the
[12:48] spirit minimality mercies completely my
[12:51] joy that ye may be like honors having
[12:53] the same love being of one for of blame
[12:56] I'm you know what is that one line come
[12:59] from you know the main I chose this
[13:01] connection to the gospel ministry while
[13:03] we have your popular ministry we succumb
[13:05] to one - right
[13:07] let's not nothing be done through strife
[13:09] or vainglory but in lowliness of mind
[13:11] let each esteem other better than
[13:13] themselves but not every man on his own
[13:16] things but every man also on the things
[13:19] of others let this continue which left
[13:24] is act of the human will again this is
[13:27] your this is your part in what you do
[13:29] it's an active thing like the woman in a
[13:33] man when they're loving intimate to this
[13:35] children you know she has to be
[13:37] available she has to be willing to
[13:38] submit and surrender and so forth
[13:40] maintain the bride with pride
[13:43] the bridegroom we have to let be willing
[13:46] but we have to let part of our reward is
[13:50] a choice different attitudes isn't
[13:52] really your attitude towards the world
[13:54] my brother Cory was free fall back your
[13:56] attitude so important that if you take
[13:59] for God but it's mine being you but also
[14:01] listening prosecutors who may have for
[14:03] God but not Robert being worked on but
[14:06] made himself of no reputation that the
[14:09] by himself to form a circuit I was made
[14:11] of Alaska men and being found in fashion
[14:14] as a man he humbled himself in the
[14:17] penalty of conjugation
[14:18] death of the cross I told Gaby dozen
[14:21] years ago I said I use the phrase assume
[14:24] the position all right I don't mean that
[14:25] in the wrong way but like similar
[14:27] position you know pray in the humble
[14:30] position now on your knees every day
[14:32] prayer position
[14:33] green hair Bible all that every single
[14:35] day not into routine but just a book
[14:37] showing it showing off how sincere you
[14:39] are and whether you think you're getting
[14:41] now that or not the fact is you just
[14:43] keep going no matter what
[14:44] don't give you something it won't work
[14:46] if you see there a bit of that
[14:52] [Applause]
[14:56] okay this is mostly still way to take
[15:00] all the minor project entering into
[15:01] fellowship with him and on prayer
[15:03] coffees like our burning bush the school
[15:06] is all wrong ideas and thought to take
[15:08] on the money price okay so to speak we
[15:12] lose our mind spiritually speaking there
[15:14] because I think it was on my brain
[15:17] emphasis recruiting the Midland driving
[15:19] all those years five hours or something
[15:22] four hours every Sunday for twenty years
[15:25] or something pushes off your life if
[15:28] listen when he accepted the disease look
[15:30] at from a formal aspect in fact I
[15:32] thought she lost her mind
[15:33] well she found a much she found dry and
[15:35] i hanged out there to seek after what
[15:37] was precious to her she thanked him with
[15:39] such a high priority of her life that
[15:41] was served and over attitude for him for
[15:43] his cooking in a high priority
[15:45] she said what I've got to have and this
[15:46] is one fine piece and you know us when
[15:49] we def and I had heard on baby him on
[15:51] the hospital of death you know and our
[15:54] mind I really thought she was going to
[15:56] be dead when we left her and went to
[15:57] church here devala second in the next
[16:00] Sunday morning service I'll really
[16:02] touched me that we got that okay off
[16:04] today is lost trying but yet the fact is
[16:07] I lost my line so together we just total
[16:10] loss or mind we just want trying since
[16:11] all the money naturally lost your mind
[16:13] so retarders our mind spiritual take
[16:15] almond on Christ
[16:17] okay you
[16:20] three so how they things on the GAO
[16:24] content ditching all right
[16:27] but the letter killeth the spear given
[16:29] plot and in the presence of that burning
[16:31] bush you know more about dog problem
[16:33] mantises motive then he's been talking
[16:36] for years while whether it was an
[16:38] experience he just didn't have a letter
[16:41] to read or the law to read or the books
[16:44] to read he had an experience that dog
[16:46] still lived the God of Abraham what you
[16:48] just did
[16:49] locked in that day and that floor lamp
[16:52] as he was when he talks head man
[16:58] into one finitary why frosty 59 can
[17:03] afford even but one time in the presence
[17:05] of the anointing one time in the
[17:07] presence of the burning bush you know
[17:09] more about dogs than he learned in books
[17:12] in the eight years of his life dog
[17:14] trying to spend that a naught sent them
[17:16] is an experience takes them to the rigor
[17:19] training down through the sense of
[17:21] burning to punishment trying testing
[17:23] only 30 do that to his profit but it
[17:26] does it to its children
[17:27] every summer comes to God must be taking
[17:29] in driving it's advised were blind
[17:36] Bartimaeus is several 301 neither spoke
[17:38] saying go both Airy into a secret
[17:43] project and close the door and when you
[17:45] have did so right of your father who
[17:48] sees in secret and even safely reward
[17:50] the opening and when we're praying like
[17:52] that there seems to be something to the
[17:54] prayer that they call the hypocrisy out
[17:56] of it means like we get a better
[17:58] connection with God to get long up to my
[18:02] car this is mama bear claws I took my
[18:05] chicken truck I went down the road and
[18:09] just studying both wrote about hold his
[18:12] mouth out your little on drama or if you
[18:15] meditate if you think it on these thing
[18:17] but over there
[18:18] just studying after I knock to the
[18:22] highway where was prettier office some
[18:24] country roads allow it become so filled
[18:27] with His mercies and good until I've
[18:29] just stopped the car and helper will and
[18:31] wept like a little baby we've ever done
[18:32] that driving long distances you know the
[18:35] benefit of long drive and so I kept my
[18:37] driving job I've had three offers and
[18:40] the last two or three years to make a
[18:42] boss position well - were lost another
[18:45] anyway in all cases I would have a
[18:47] company car companies all pay cut less
[18:51] money they kind of anyway besides that I
[18:55] ordered it all this time there with God
[18:57] because there's my favorite thing that's
[18:59] the number one benefit of driving truck
[19:01] music still on gone nobody bother you
[19:03] out there myself walking out today and
[19:06] that's why it helps on top of that job
[19:08] for ten years that's what I did because
[19:11] there in the bank about the Lord it's a
[19:14] world level but they you all can find
[19:17] your own place
[19:18] you know why female driver 14 hour
[19:20] debate is still there it somewhere the
[19:23] believers position in crime 5501 on six
[19:26] to one
[19:27] we found some destruction come Dillon
[19:29] God revealed himself to him in the
[19:31] burning bush he found out then that the
[19:33] very thing that was then the burning
[19:35] bush was saying that he lacked and I
[19:37] think that whole of us today and many
[19:39] times we try to do the program ourselves
[19:41] and felt to get what was in the burning
[19:43] bush the direct revelation of the real
[19:46] and timeless God
[19:50] okay well the boss cream blush I'm
[19:52] talking about
[19:53] I thought about three men ferment then
[19:56] after she our godly men in our position
[19:58] I rank to name our heart with God and
[20:02] I'll count to discuss with you this idea
[20:04] of emulation so I think that's about
[20:07] where we'll talk about man so like we're
[20:10] in a free enterprise and discussing you
[20:12] not say free to start our own business
[20:14] you know so like somebody doesn't have
[20:17] the copyright or whatever the patent on
[20:20] the top the automobile thought until I
[20:23] started hopping to go build a car you
[20:24] know program free enterprise spiritually
[20:27] speaking on a free enterprise is for
[20:28] whosoever will offend another ball and
[20:31] found a way to grow closer to God and
[20:34] then put him in a position he's spent
[20:36] time and secret got a reward him openly
[20:38] because I can stand everything can talk
[20:40] to his revelation and perceived that
[20:42] he's got moved somewhere with God right

[27:01] it made your tulips are things are
[27:02] honest the truth is what probably
[27:04] realized you're a sinner personally
[27:06] right cause you'd be honest with
[27:09] yourself come to reality where you are

[28:00] virtue now you put a Pharma statutory
[28:03] purpose man and then if they're being
[28:05] afraid the heads no you know coming to
[28:08] process that hearing you become so one

[28:14] make or anything so when you're alone if
[28:17] you can't seem to get the wheels turning
[28:18] you can't seem to think about whether or
[28:21] what can i what can I do how can I start

[28:30] grandma when I was three or four years
[28:31] old was reading the Bible to the in
