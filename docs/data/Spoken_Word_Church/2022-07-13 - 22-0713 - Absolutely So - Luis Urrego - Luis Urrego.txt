opportunity to still hear the word of god amen we appreciate the lord and what he's doing how many thank god for what he's doing in sister freda's body amen he's still if she's watching us right now sister freda we still serve a healing god amen a god that heals no matter what the doctors say god has the final say so amen praise the lord jesus so we just thank god we're we're we're we're happy with her because she's happy we're joyful with her because she's joyful amen we cry with those that cry amen we mourn and with those that mourn and we're we're excited with those that are excited amen so we just thank god for that and we just want to give him the praise for it and uh so while you're standing this this evening we want to go ahead to the book of second peter chapter one ii peter chapter 1 and we're going to read here from verses 1 through 12 a very familiar scripture here in this in this in this church because we believe it amen we believe it second peter 1 verse 1 says simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness so i like that it says they're hath given unto us all things amen praise god it's all it's all in you amen we just got to let it out those virtues are holy ghost virtues they've been given to you you just got to let them out praise god as you live as you go through trials go through life that's when these virtues start being displayed through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye may be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge into knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind so it's important to have them right otherwise you're going to be blind spiritually and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give dylan this is what i want to concentrate on where for the rather brother and give diligence to make your calling an election sure sure amen when you are sure you're sure right when something is sure it's sure it's it's it's stable for if you do these things ye shall never fall because you're sure amen you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ and verse 12 says wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established or in other words be sure be established in the present truth praise the lord jesus amen so this morning this this evening we want to talk about i'm going to title it absolutely so and uh my wife may be smiling but absolutely so the importance of having an absolute in your life amen and i want to talk to all of us but i want our young people to listen as well amen reason why i say absolutely so is because you know in speaking that i remember brother marcus becker from germany whenever you talk to him and then you give him a a a a a a sentence or you or you make a statement to him and say brothers uh marcus such and such and such and then he'll go absolutely so [Laughter] absolutely so uh what's uh and then there's another one that he says i can't remember what it is but that always stuck to me so since we're supposed to have an absolute right it's got to be absolutely so amen praise god so hopefully you'll never forget this title absolutely so all right let's just go to the lord in prayer our heavenly father we thank you lord jesus once again for the opportunity to serve you lord to open back the pages of your word we ask father that you would just uh speak to our hearts lord god almighty you fill in the gaps lord jesus wherever father god we've studied we've done what we could lord god but you're the one that knows the needs of the people here father and you can fill in those gaps you can speak to the hearts directly father god to and to whatever that need may be lord jesus father i ask that you would just change us through your word father because without your word father we cannot be changed without your holy spirit we cannot change lord it takes your holy spirit father to change us and it's a change father that has to take place from the inside out i pray lord that you'd bless and continue to meet the needs amongst us father and lord you just have your will in your way tonight help me to get aside lord so that you speak lord and forgive us for all of our sins lord god and father just we just commit this rest of the service into your hands in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you saints praise the lord good to have brother micah here with us this afternoon and each and every one of you i trust that trust that everyone's doing well praise the lord absolutely so or exactly so that's the other one that he would say exactly so amen so i i'm i'm if you go back and you read brother branham where he preached an absolute i'm pretty much getting a lot of this from from that sermon but we'll just go and i want to talk to a couple of things that that brother branham didn't touch upon in that sermon but but uh i think it's very relevant to this day especially especially for our young people and uh but we we see here that that in in in living life uh saints you you can't live life without you standing on something you see you you've got to stand for something and you've got to you've got to you you've got to sometimes make a stand amen and when you say that you make a stand that means you're standing on that point and you're standing on that and nothing can move you from that praise god and and and you could take for for example uh brother brown made a statement where you could take for example a red light amen the red light when you're when you're driving down the road and and you see those red lights amen those are those are absolutes for for traffic amen when you see a red light that's in red amen there's not a human being there taking you know telling you to stop but that is that is an absolute for you to stop you must stop otherwise there'll be there'll be chaos and when it says green you go man because that is the absolute that is what we we abide by in order to get traffic flowing you see we have to have an absolute when we when we when we have traffic man when we're out driving in traffic amen and you can take you also look for example a a a a boat amen and and a boat has to have an anchor in order especially the big boats they have to have anchors in order for them to be able to stand still while while parked you see otherwise the winds will come or a storm will come through and then take that boat and then that boat starts drifting off into the sea and the owner is like where's my yacht and you got to have an anchor amen you got to have to have something that that that anchor has to stick on firm ground amen where that boat cannot move from there praise god and i'm so thankful lord that our lord jesus christ is our anchor in this hour amen because brother brown uh there's that song you know the anchor holds amen though the ship is battered the ankle the anchor holds amen your anchor won't hold but but amen but his anchor wills amen and he is the anchor and when you get a hold and and you put confidence in that amen you can leave your boat amen right there in confidence and say and say my boat's going to be okay amen my life is going to be okay because i put my confidence in that anchor amen and that anchor is the word of god amen my children are going to be okay because i place them in in that anchor amen and that anchor is the word of god amen my church family is going to be okay my body is going to be all right because i place my confidence in that anchor and i know that that that won't move anywhere amen that captain has he totally puts confidence in that anchor that when he lets it down right he'll come back the next day and his boat would be right there amen when you look at the scripture and when you put your faith in it right rightly then it'll be able to stand amen otherwise if it's just you reading and then you give your own opinion about it it they won't stand amen but just read it and take it like as it is and go with it amen it'll stand the word of god speaks for itself amen it takes god god said let there be light amen and that what was the manifestation of that light is that it appeared the confirmation of that word is that that light came to be amen the word manifests or confirms itself you don't have to push and and shove amen it manifests itself as long as you put faith in that word of god amen praise the lord jesus so bold anchor amen brother brandon would say like this he says that that is the way a man when he is born again of the holy spirit he's got a hold of something that's got an anchor out yonder and the storms doesn't shake him he knows he's all right he's anchored all right amen you know that nothing can shake you you know that the current present conditions won't shake you if you're standing on the anchor if you're holding on the word amen standing fast on that word praise god you could take also for example a couple that that's planning to get married and what's going to hold them the only thing that can hold them they better be getting married for love not because i i i want his money later on or her money later on or i want amen as a matter of fact you should actually join all those things together it's not your money anymore it's not his money anymore it's our money amen it's it's our it's everything is ours amen so so uh i better be careful with that but i believe that with all my heart i mean i've been married 16 16 years right 16 years sweetheart and you know what it works because that's that's how it's supposed to be amen two two people become one so it's not my bed it's our bed it's not my chair it's our chairs not my money it's our money amen but you should get married amen what anchors both of you is love amen the love that you have for her the love that you have for him amen that should be an absolute that that will help drive your marriage amen i love her and that's what drives me no matter what i got to give up i got to give up time to play my video games i can't do that anymore hey man video games went out the window even though i love them hey man i got to now spend some time with my wife i got i got to do husband things now hey man i can't i got to spend time with the children i got to do fatherly things now you see there's things that you must give up so that love is an anchor or it's an absolute that should drive us and help us amen in our in our in our in our marriage praise the lord amen we read in the bible where all where the different different ones had had to have an absolute amen you take a look for example that job amen job had to have an absolute when all of his family and all of his all of his children and and and and his house amen just everything went falling apart he had to have something to anchor him amen and and it's not promised to us that our life is going to be easy the way it is now amen things change things thing thing people change situations change you've got to have something amen to stand on in this hour and it can't be your opinions and it can't be dr so-and-so amen doctor this that or the other amen it's got to have the only thing that will stand amen is the word of god heaven and earth will pass away dr so and so will pass away amen but his word will never pass away amen so you've got to have an absolute in this hour amen job had to have an absolute amen when all of his family when people were coming to him and say hey listen your children are gone and your and and and your house and your donkeys and your cows and everything is gone amen and when his wife was telling him that he needed to give up and curse god and die his anchor amen his absolute needed to stay because even wife was telling him to curse god and die he had to have an absolute inside of him amen i'm not going to serve god just because mom's serving god i'm not going to serve god amen just because i see my dad's doing it or i see my children amen i got to serve god for myself because one day they may not serve him anymore one day brother wade maybe he might not serve god anymore i can't be looking at brother wade i've got to look at my my own experience with god we're believing that brother wood will always serve god amen amen but we we we we we can't we can't base our our or or live behind somebody's coattail amen you've got to have your own experience praise the lord jesus amen noah had to have an absolute amen one day he was he was he was living and and one day the lord told him he said i want you to go out here and build his boat he had to take god amen and he had to know that that was god telling him to build that boat took him many years to build it but it was that absolute amen that that faith that he had in what he was hearing amen that drove him to make the create to make that boat praise the lord jesus amen and everybody else was laughing at him everybody else was mocking him everybody else was telling him that he was crazy amen but he had to know where he was standing he had to know that he was sure beyond the shadow of doubt that he had heard from god amen do you know beyond the shadow of doubt amen when that when the when the when the uh uh the ones that laugh at you the the the the mockers the the people that that that that make fun of you amen when they come around or those that that try to challenge you amen where are you going to be standing amen praise god do you have that anchor inside of you young people do you have an anchor inside of you well i just go to church just because my parents go to church or i just hey man do you really know where you're standing because you're gonna need to you're going to need to later on in life you're going to need to mommy and daddy won't always be with you where are you going to be standing or is everything that they've taught you from when you were little is it just a waste of time one day you will have to meet amen and know where what is it that i truly believe amen what do i truly believe do i really have an absolute in my life do i really have an anchor in my life because the world won't give you anything like that the world gives you things that are wishy-washy one day one day where where they're believing this the next day they're believing or not something else amen you can see it in the news amen the news one day is this the next day is something else the next day is something else and what happened three days before nobody will remember anymore constant change constant change but god's word never changed ever since that it was spoken and written amen it never has changed and it's still changing lives it doesn't change but it changes lives hallelujah praise the lord what a wonderful thing and it's not just the physical words in that book amen it's the spirit that gives life amen when you take that personally to you and say that promise is mine it will come to pass amen i believe sister freda the past several weeks i i think she took god seriously hey man when do you have to have a situation like that to take god seriously i hope not i i don't want to and i want to take god seriously now amen but i believe she took god seriously and i believe god is you pl you do business with me i'll do business with you let's sit at the table and you you take god you take my word at heart and i'll i'll fulfill my word and we're seeing it come to pass praise the lord jesus and i believe we're going to see greater things amen praise the lord jesus abraham had to have an absolute amen praise the lord jesus he was living his life amen working living doing amen but one day god told him to go move to a strange land that he had never even heard of and he had to believe that that was god talking to him amen several years had passed god told him you're going to have a child and that child is going to be between it's going to be from your loins and sarah was the one who was going to bear that child and he had to believe that that was going to happen even though amen it seemed like it was an impossibility amen amen you know uh abraham's life all the different things even up to the point where god told them go sacrifice that child how many of us would be willing to do something like that but see abraham had to know that it was god or that absolute talking to him because if he was if he wasn't sure i don't know it could have been the devil talking to me so i'm not going to do it no he knew that it was god talking to him therefore he took action amen but he also had that promise in his heart amen that through the loins of this of this son of mine that i was going to have many many generations many children and many people great people would rise up out of so he knew that some way somehow isaac had to live he that it wasn't that wasn't his end amen and abraham had to have an absolute had to have an anchor that that was god speaking to him do you have an anchor that that is god speaking to you through his word praise the lord jesus when he sees when when you read something in the word and you and and and you're going through a certain need you're going through a certain trial you see it in the word amen why don't why not just believe it why not just take it to you personally like abraham did and say god i don't know how it's going to be done but you said it and i believe it that settles it for me let me just go ahead and take the wood and let me go ahead and just do what exactly what abraham did and abraham didn't even have the holy ghost you and i have the holy ghost in this hour praise god you can read about moses and about paul amen and the different ones shadrach meshach and abednego daniel had an absolute amen it doesn't matter what the world says the ma the world told him he couldn't go to church anymore he couldn't pray anymore amen he still opened those doors and he prayed three times a day and he didn't care if the king saw him either he didn't care if if if if who saw him amen he was he was worshiping his absolute his absolute wasn't was in the white house his absolute wasn't wasn't any anybody else a man it was it was god praise the lord jesus amen so we all got to have an absolute in this hour saints and and the reason why i felt so compelled to to to i've just been thinking about this i i really enjoyed the other the other day brother brother bob preaching on on on on that message he preached kind of sort of on these lines amen and and and we see amen nowadays how how how truth has been so skewed that there's there's no truth now amongst even amongst our christian young people they're almost as afraid to stand on something yeah it's almost and it's not their fault this is the culture around them that tells them that it's okay for you to have your truth and it's okay for me to have my truth and they were both right when the word of god totally says the opposite jesus christ didn't say you have your way your truth and your life and i have my way my truth in my life no he said i am the way the truth and the life and he didn't say i am a way a truth or a life he said i am the american the means the the only one the the only thing amen he is the only source of truth he is the only source of life he is the only source of all these things that we need i can't believe influencer so-and-so amen pewdiepie on youtube amen he's not the source of truth now for those who know who pewdiepie is yeah he's a youtube influencer with like millions of views and millions of subscribers in his channel he talks about gaming and stuff like that but he also gives his his own opinions amen or what's the other one's name i i have his name written here the people are are looking at him nowadays james charles how many heard of james charles [Laughter] well he's he's he's he's he's he's a he's a homosexual who who who who paints his face he's a he's a boy that since 12 years old he started painting his face just like a woman and and now he has like uh contracts with revlon and all those different companies i mean it was the first gay person homosexual contracted by these by these uh makeup companies to actually promote his his their their products and he's got millions of subscribers on youtube now is he your source of truth is that where you stand you know i i want i want i want us to take this cereal or or is or is uh uh lily singh is is she your source of of of truth let me know who lily's saying yes nobody's heard of lilly singh except for me okay she's another popular youtube she's a comedian but she's she's uh she's got millions of subscribers as well but we've made especially our young people we've made that whatever you see on media or whatever you see on youtube it must be the truth it's kind of the same thing as our older generations when they saw uh in the 1930s 40s and 50s if it was on tv it must be true same thing now well if it's a if it's a youtube influencer if it's if it's on the internet well it must be true google said it so yeah but you you got to research things out yourself amen just because somebody said something is true amen or showed you that something is true doesn't mean it's true praise the lord jesus you got to know things for yourself amen praise god so we got to make we got to have we got to make his word our absolute in this hour look what brother brown says here he says oh you might say i wish that all he required today i wish that that's how he required today he was speaking of job's requirement about uh you know offering burnt offerings to for him and his family but but look what brother brown says it's less than that he says he says just just faith in his word amen and you if you make his word your absolute you can any divine promise in the bible you could tie your soul to it any divine promise amen i can't i can't time my soul to to a tick-tock influencer no he he will fail amen i i can't tie my soul to to anybody else amen on on on in the media amen they will fail they change from one hour to the other amen but this word will never pass away this word has never failed amen and if we could raise everybody that has been blessed by this word the the billions of christians probably that have lived and anchored their souls to this word amen what would they tell you and me amen those that died in the coliseums back in the dark ages amen they had to have an anchor they had to have something that they were standing on in order to go and say i give my life for what for jesus christ are you willing to do that in this hour what what is so important to you that you're willing to die for right think about that we got to die for something we should we got to we we got to stand for something what are you willing to die for i want to die for the lord jesus christ if i have to amen but you see in serving him you actually do do that spiritually you have to die to yourself in order to live for him you see what i'm saying praise the lord jesus now so when god gives when god gives an absolute amen he always gives the vindication of that absolute amen all these people that had absolutes in their life amen moses david and all these amen god vindicated that absolute in their life some way or another amen moses was given a vindication of that absolute by that burning bush amen that vindicated to him that that is something that he could stand on because it was real he experienced it he knew he was there praise the lord jesus our problem is is that we haven't fully experienced a man had a full experience with god amen we know him intellectually we know him by the books we know him by the words we know him by the scriptures we've read and we've known him by maybe father or priest so and so or somebody telling us in the church that that's how god is amen but do you know him for yourself have you experienced his power have you experienced his healing have you experienced amen what he could do for you praise the lord jesus amen it's like a blueprint and and brother brother anderson if you could bring those pictures up how many know what a blueprint is oh my goodness praise the lord now if those who don't know what a blueprint this is more of a modern blueprint but this is a blueprint of a house right well blueprint is a plan right it's a plan that lets those that are going to build or the ones that want this house built what things are going to be so in this case the kitchen's going to be a certain certain uh place the living room's going to be a certain place the closet uh even if they go next next one there's blueprints where they tell you exactly where everything is this is a hand-drawn blueprint now to you and me that doesn't make any sense right now we know that the word of god is a blueprint it's the blueprint for you to be saved it's the blueprint it's the plan of god for you to receive the holy ghost it's the plan of god for you to receive your healing amen but many people look at that blueprint amen and it's just like looking at this blueprint i got no idea why because you're not the author of that blueprint if we went and asked the author of that blueprint sir what did you mean that 15 by 20 right here under the family room he'll tell you exactly what he meant praise god and and instead of you asking so and so or my friend so and so amen what does the word of god mean about this what what is your opinion about this amen why don't you just go and ask the author instead amen the author of the word will tell you what the word meant by that praise the lord jesus just like the author of the blueprint we'll tell you exactly what everything there is if you want to know but he's not going to tell you if you don't want to know because he might border your death but somebody that really wants to know that really wants to know about the word of god amen he'll tell you if you really want it praise the lord next and there's just some other ones right here more blueprints i got no idea what that is but the one that created it does i can't explain everything in the word but the one that wrote the word can amen and he's and he's revealed his word in this day amen praise god he sent us a prophet in this day amen and and we have clarification about that word in this hour next and here's what a there's a blueprint right here a true one so that's really what a blueprint looks like right there all right i think that's it so so you might you want to know how your how your spiritual house needs to be built look at the blueprint man what what if you told somebody if you made plans about having a house built and they came back and and you you gave them a blueprint and you coordinated everything in the in detail with them and then it took maybe three four five six months to build a house you come back and you look at and you're excited about that house my goodness i can't wait to see the house and then you look at it and that house is not anything according to the blueprint what would you tell them well that's your truth then that's true your truth and and my truth no you would tell them i'm sorry this is not what we agreed upon there's a standard we wrote it on the blueprint you confirmed that with me and now i see here i'm looking at the house that i'm so excited to see and i see that the windows there's no window here where there's supposed to be a window there's no the bathtub is not even there where it's supposed to be and all things are totally different from the blueprint you're gonna tell them tear that thing down and rebuild it amen that's the reason why there is no room for your own blueprint or your own truth there's only room for the truth amen and the truth is the blueprint amen praise the lord jesus the word of god amen amen no nobody nobody will say oh we'll just leave it like that then okay if you really want that house the way you want it amen you're going to do something about it you're going to stand on something you're going to stand to be uh to make sure that that's done properly and that's the reason why young people amen that our parents and ministers they stand on the word of god the way they do amen because it can't just be any way it's got to be exactly according to the blueprint or it's not any or anything or not it's got to go exactly by the blueprint and the blueprint said how do i get received the holy ghost amen you've got to repent then be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of those sins then you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost that is the blueprint of god and that will make sure that will make sure that your house will stand and they will look exactly the way the word of god says how many are following me praise the lord jesus you are being so good and paying attention praise the lord jesus all right and i want to deal with this for just a moment about your truth versus the truth amen because it's a phrase that i keep hearing a lot uh you hear it on social media a lot and on the internet you hear a lot of young people nowadays talking about well it's my truth and it's your truth but there's no such a thing let me i'll tell you the reason why because amen or you hear the phrase speak your truth amen and really these are phrases that we should actually refrain from using especially as christians amen because we don't have our own truth where amen we're and and what that leads us amen uh because i read something and it said that words build were worlds amen so whatever whatev whenever you hear this phrase and it's become and it's become more and more popular amen it starts making it it starts normalizing it for the people until they just say it and don't even think about it anymore how many how many words and phrases have we have we you know taken throughout the years and and we say them now and we we don't even think about it anymore they're just part of our vocabulary anymore we don't even go back and see where that stems from or where that's coming from amen but you have your truth and i have my own truth you you do you and i do me you do you what does that mean what is that supposed to mean for one it gives an a it gives actually an attitude of like i don't care about you whatever happens to you that's not my concern right now here's a few problems with that phrase my truth amen was what it what it it makes us think that we are our own source of truth when in reality we are not amen you didn't come to this world amen by yourself you didn't create yourself amen you have a creator therefore he is the source of truth praise the lord amen all your truth amen you give it up to him you give it up to this truth amen you have no truth for yourself so it makes us look like that that that you are your own source of of knowledge in reality that's make it raising yourself and making yourself it brings it leads to pride leads to pride it also gives false impressions that the truth is is rocky or fluid in other words that there is nothing absolute well that's your truth but i have my truth so where what is the truth then this you see what i'm trying to ask what is the truth then your truth and my truth okay but where is the truth amen in other words that truth can change that's what that phrase makes it sound like it gives the impression that truth is not consistent that's what that phrase gives that there is no consistency in truth but the truth is always consistent amen and it leaves people with nothing constant or reliable to stand on when i tell you well that's my truth and you have your truth i mean it doesn't leave it doesn't leave anything reliable to stand on i can't stand on your truth and you can't stand on my truth so therefore it's mediocre there's there it's just the middle ground and there's no truth and that's what the world is trying to portray to us in this hour there's nothing for you to stand on you have nothing to stand on that's what they want you to think and when you don't have anything to stand on amen that you easily fall for anything you fall for anything and everything they tell you when you don't have nothing to stand on but it's cloaked as my truth and your tooth and your truth in reality what it is is my opinion and your opinion that's what that is it's not your truth or it's not my truth amen your truth is just as good as mine so no one is wrong no one is wrong nobody gets offended because it's all about nobody gets offended anymore you know everybody that participates gets a prize you know it used to be when i was in school amen you only got a prize when you won there was first second and third place you got a prize if you worked hard and you won now everybody gets a prize everybody it's mediocracy let me tell you what mediocracy means it's a blend of mediocre and the greek is a which is the root word crossy meaning rule or government or governing body mediocre comes from the latin mediocrities meaning in a middle state in other words not here nor there yeah lukewarm that's exactly what it is lukewarm and what did what did jesus say in revelations that he would do with lukewarm people he would spit him right out of his mouth and so that is what society young people is trying to form your mind right now to become lukewarm and not stand on anything because when you don't stand on when you have nothing to stand on you fall for everything and you take everything and you receive everything because hey it's their truth and so i have to respect it sure yeah you respect people you respect people's opinion that's what that is your truth is your opinion my truth is my opinion but there is the truth right this is what what stands right praise the lord jesus how many are still with me amen all right so they used celebrities back in 2018 this phrase started being used speak your truth and you know who started using it first none other than oprah winfrey and you know that she is the uh the the the culmination of truth whatever she said a lot of people that's that's she's the gospel amen but she started using that and it's become something that uh you just believe whatever you want and it's and it's right i believe whatever i want and it's right but it's totally contrary to why jesus spoke in the bible amen so what this phrase what it does it if it feeds the idea that the world uh is waiting for your opinion speak your truth that the world wants to hear from you hence that's the reason why we get on social media and we air out all of our laundry on social media but when you confront a person head on face to face they won't tell you what they tell you on facebook or what they tell you on text message that's why it's so important amen that we don't totally rely on these on these devices for communication god created us to talk face to face that is leaving but that is not the original way the original way was talking face to face meeting face to face handling things face to face because you know what through text through facebook through these different avenues you write something and somebody else will take it differently than when you wrote it it's not reliable it's not reliable so sometimes it's best to just go to the brother go to the sister and say listen this such and such and such and such and you look him right in the face let's take care of this right now right nyla forgive me all right see i'm looking at her right now i'm seeing her reaction right she's smiling but what if i was telling her that in text message let's take care of this right now she would probably take it oh he's upset but i wasn't i was playing with her right because she laughed but in a text message she might take it a different way that's why it's so important amen that we don't forget amen it's important to talk to people some of us don't even want to talk to anybody amen service is over and we just rush right out amen that won't help you later on in life that won't help you later on in life that's going to be something that's going to hinder you later on in life some of us don't even know how to communicate with people so how do you learn how to communicate with people talk to people you want to be a better communicator you want to learn things from people talk to people ask them questions amen you want to learn how to lose weight talk to the one that's lost weight man you want to learn about changing the tire talk to the one that changes his attire and that works on cars you see what i'm saying you want to learn how to how to get to be a mayor talk to the mayor [Laughter] praise the lord but do you get my point amen praise the lord so social media has become a place to speak out you air out your laundry on there but then when you face them face to face they're cowards they won't say to you in in in your face what they say on tick tock or or facebook or or all these other media outlets they won't so don't depend on those things speak your truth your truth amen and so what what that's doing saints is fulfilling what jesus said that will happen in the last days that the love of many shall wax cold because why you do you and i do me and we just go our separate ways not caring what that brother what that person is going through or or or desiring to even know more about that person you do you i do me and that's fulfilling exactly what jesus said that the love of many in the last days shall wax cold in other words your love for people is going to get colder and colder and colder and that is not the spirit of god second timothy 3 1 tells us this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come how many how many can agree that we're here i mean food supply chains going uh gas prices uh ukraine and all this kind of stuff is amen all these things are happening now verse 2 says for man shall be lovers of their own selves you do you and i do me and these devices they don't help lovers of themselves that's why it's so surprising to me i just i want you to think about this think about this because 40 years ago it wasn't like this 30 years ago it wasn't like that you're writing people don't have anything to talk about anymore because why they say it all on on on on on facebook or on text messages and when they get together you still see them with their phone and they got their friends right next to each other and all of them are on their phone i thought you're supposed to be like talking and fellowshipping with one oh yeah we are as we're using our phones hey did you see this okay we're fellowshipping yeah we're talking but but 30 years ago 20 years ago it wasn't like that it was totally different and people that that taught people how to how to care more for each other to know more about each other see we think that we're connected to these social medias uh and all these different things and that we we just know everything about everybody but not everybody that's in your friend list is really your friend they're just acquaintances or or somebody that you might have met somewhere one day and then they they decided on facebook that that you know they they you know to friend you that doesn't mean they're your friend a friend or somebody that you know personally and that knows you personally amen i consider brother wade my friend because i know him personally consider brother boyd my friend i know him personally praise the lord those are not your friends on social media amen maybe you do you might have a few of them that hey man but do you really fellowship with people all right so it's become today in the same way so you remember we got to get back we got to have an absolute so let's we've established that your truth is not the absolute right my truth is not the absolute i can't stand on my truth you can't stand on your truth but i can stand we both can stand on this truth they're truth of the word of god we can always stand on that right remember you didn't come here to the bible says that you didn't create yourself you didn't come here by your own by your own desire amen he created you amen therefore you owe your life to him praise god amen judge today it's becoming like like it was in the days of the judges man judges 21 25 says in those days there was no king in israel every man did that which was right in his own eyes because there was no absolute there was no standard there was no king there was no lawgiver there was nobody that they could look to and say and say that is who we follow and so everybody did whatever they thought it was right whatever whatever came to their mind my truth and your truth and if i wanted to kill uh such and such a person go right ahead that's your truth and if such as such a person wanted to rape such and such a girl amen go right ahead that's your truth and there was no law almost kind of like becoming like like today lawless lawlessness if we're not careful this is exactly where this nation is going to bunch of communistic lawlessness lawlessness and and so it's so important for you to have a king amen in your life praise god the king of kings the lord of lords amen you want to know something about lying the bible tells you exactly what to talk about lying go to the book of proverbs go to the book of psalms it tells you it tells you plenty about lying amen go to the book of exodus it tells you about lying you want to know about fornication should should i have sexual relationships before i get married the bible tells you exactly where amen it tells you exactly what you need to do that is our king that is our absolute praise god amen but you know the believers of today amen they've taken their own absolute i feel like staying at home and listening to tapes and listening to uh streaming in and and where's that in the world well it's not in the word but it's right in my own eyes it's my truth and it's not based on the word of god everything that you that that you live by you've got to base it you have to have a foundation it's got to be in the message it's got to be in the in the word of god amen so your truth is groundless amen there's no ground for you to stand on with your truth amen your truth will fail but his truth will never fail praise the lord jesus i'm going to go a little quicker here brother brown tells us this and the message absolutely he says he says this i've just seen many religions very devout many times more sincere than the christian people of today profess all right brother branham he traveled all over the world when preaching the gospel when a mother can take her little fat black baby about that long and speaking about you know people in india and and it says here and throw it into the mouth of a crocodile for the love of her god i wonder how sincere christianity is when a man can afflict himself in such a way would put in a thousand hooks through his flesh like that hanging with balls of water you see in other words he he sticks hooks all over his and they're hanging with little weights with a ball of water so it's pulling on the skin all over his body sounds nasty doesn't it esther it looks it's done they do it in in in in hindu religions and things like that he says they put a thousand hooks through his flesh like that a thousand of them would put in a thou uh let's see like that hang him with balls of water holding him down like this and walk through a streak of fire from here to the end of that tabernacle back and forth and it white hot fanned like that for the sacrifice of his god an idol there with ruby eisen and so forth i wonder where christianity is so don't think sincerity sincerity is not it so he he's about to he's about to address sincerity sincerity is not his sincerity sincerity is all right if it's placed on the right thing right like a doctor giving medicine watch this example that he gives he he says he might give you arsenic sincerely arsenic is a poison he might give you arsenic sincerely and he might give you sulfuric acid sincerely you might have your prescription filled wrong and you might take it in sincere insincerity but that don't save your life see no sir you've got to know what you're doing or in other words you've got to know where you're standing and anything contrary to god's word i don't care what it is and how long it's been in existence it's still wrong amen i don't care if president so-and-so said i don't care what madam or queen such-and-such said amen if it's contrary to the word of god it's wrong even though they say it in sincerity there's many sincere people around the world but they can be sincerely wrong right it doesn't make them bad people but you can be very sincere and be very sincerely wrong amen so which one which one is more important to you is sincerity more important to you or is truth more important to you answer that question let me let me ask that again is sincerity is somebody being sincere to you sincere more important to you or is the truth or is truth that comes out of their mouth is that more important to you right amen i'd rather have truth amen because you can say something with a passion and really feel sincere about it but you're wrong because it's not based on truth right right so let's define sincerity real quick sincerity is the quality of being free from pretense deceit or hypocrisy and so now let's look at that truth truth is the property of being in accord with fact or reality yeah so sincerity is good i'm not saying it's bad it's really good we all got to be sincere but we all have to have our sincerity based on facts based on truth praise god so is it possible for someone to be sincere and still be untruthful yeah somebody come you you somebody comes to you and tells you well hey i heard such and such as or tells you this that or the other this oh really well where'd you hear that from well i heard it from such and such as oh so you continue digging for that truth amen where did they hear it from get to the bottom of the of it amen because it can be said with sincerity but it can be no truth behind it and then we've got to base everything we say we got to base everything we believe on truth praise the lord amen praise god so it's like it's like a thinking about this example it's like a little kid that gets in trouble how many that have had children and and they do something that they're not supposed to do and and and you catch them in the act and you say well that's it you know you're you know i'm gonna have to take your toys away or i'm gonna have to do something you you you start delivering the punishment and then that you can see them in their faces i promise i won't do it again i won't do it again they're sincere but you don't know if they're really mean it in their heart they're being sincere i mean i believe that they really don't want to do it again but do they really mean it in their heart because the next day you see him doing the same thing again you knew that that sincerity was not based upon fact or upon truth oh well do it again mommy i promise i won't do it again just just don't don't don't spank me i've done it i did it with my parents many times i still got it you know what i'm thankful thankful that i did like brother branham said it made me who i am today amen i'm thankful that that my mom and dad didn't cut corners with me or or or or just very loose with me amen it made me who i am today amen and those of you who who planned on having children later on in life amen amen don't think because society is changing that you have to change the way god said for you to raise children amen god said amen apply the rod when it needs to be applied that's what he said i didn't say that's truth that's fact that is what i will stand on but society says no you're damaging that child you're doing the the word of god is my absolute the word of god now there is a right way to do it don't do it out of anger you will damage that child yes for sure amen but if you talk to them and say listen do you know why you did this and then the other you give them the reason why you're applying the punishment and if and give them bible-based reasons because when you always give them the bible race reasons they'll they'll know as they're growing up amen it's got to be based on the word of god amen but if it's your opinion that you're giving them amen then that that won't stand praise the lord all right so the word true watch because there's very many true things but there is the truth amen the word true is an adjective and adjectives describe a person place or thing right that's what the word true because you could say for example uh uh i don't know that's the true that's a true uh i don't know that's a true thing on that car you know you're just describing something about that car right but the word truth is a noun amen and a noun is a per it's a person a place or a thing it's the person it's d place or it's d thing man so that's the difference between true and truth because sometimes people use it interchangeably but it really means two different things amen praise god so let's make sure we're standing on something saints let's make sure we're standing on tr and on truth and truth and who is the truth our lord jesus christ i know this may may sound like a broken record to to many of us but i want to tell you adults have patience because our young people they're fighting spirits that you didn't fight 10 15 20 years ago and so if somebody can say something about these things to kind of guide them amen be patient be patient oh he's not preaching daniel 70 weeks he's not preaching statue of a perfect man amen this all blends in this all has to do with it this all has to do with it and if we don't address it hey man who will the tick tock they're getting all their info from the tick tock influencer from the youtube influencer man it's time that somebody stand and man and give them something that will give them amen hope there is hope in christ young people there's no hope in the world there's no hope in in in in smoking there's no hope in vaping there's no hope in premarital sex not all that all that joy of all those things go away but you experience christ one time for real amen that will always stay that experience will never go away but you've got to have it for yourself for real not just one time but but but a reality and and the reality could be that you didn't jump or shout or scream you don't need to when that word has anchored down in your heart and everything that you do and everywhere you go that word never leaves you amen something has happened in your life and that it's changing you from the inside out that you're no longer the person that you are you no longer dress the way you used to dress you're no longer talking the way you used to talk amen it's changing you from the inside out then that means an anchor you you stand up you've stood you've got an absolute in your life amen it's like it's like peter peter now uh we'll we'll finish up with this peter amen when he walked out of that boat i mean the what the storms and the storm and the waves everything was gone was going crazy and they were on the boat they didn't have anything that they were that they were anchored on and all the disciples they were all scared they were they didn't know where to go it was dark the bible says that it was in the third i believe it was the third or sixth hour of the night it was darkness and in the middle of this darkness appears this ghost can you imagine that imagine it's thundering and lightning outside and then all of a sudden in your room you see this ghost but really it was actually the lord jesus christ and they see it from far off and they think it's a ghost amen brother branham says that the thing that could help them they got scared of amen and they started screaming and said oh it's a ghost and so they were they were paying more attention now to the to the ghost than they were to the storm they were very the bi i was looking into that and they were very superstitious people the jews the jews are so they take those things seriously but here comes jesus walking on the water doing something that they had never seen anybody else do before defying nature defying his own word his own creation he's over his own creation amen he's over amen you if you're you're if you're his creation and he's walking on the water and then peter gets this bright idea and says lord after jesus tells him do not be afraid it is i he makes sure that he he vindicates who he is i am that absolute don't be afraid it's i don't be afraid young people to stand on that word it's just the lord jesus christ do you love the lord jesus christ then don't be afraid to take him by his word it's just the lord and he wants the best for you and so peter says well lord if it's you bid me to go and lord jesus just tells him come doesn't explain the seven seals to them doesn't doesn't say something real deep and it doesn't it just doesn't come yeah it's like what brother wade's been saying amen don't worry about those things eventually you need to learn about those things because they're in the word but right now if you're trying to find christ amen find christ don't worry about the statue of perfect man those things you need amen but amen get to christ that's what peter needed to do amen get to christ and now he just he had the word come and and peter with that that was enough for him he gets off the boat amen and starts walking and starts walking and he had nothing to hold on to amen he himself defying nature remember peter didn't even have the holy ghost doing something just because he saw the lord jesus do it just because he saw his absolute do it he made jesus his absolute at that moment and nothing was going to stop him then you think his friends the other disciples where are you going peter man you crazy man what man what's and you're going to die out there no my absolute said so i'm going i'm going i don't care it takes a step of faith young people it takes a a faith it takes a step of faith for you to stand on that absolute and he kept going and he kept going until finally he got to his absolute i mean but sometimes when we get to our absolutely we might have an experience with god and we let the elements of the world the world again around us brother someone so offended me sister so-and-so offended me brother so-and-so from the pulpit said this that or the other i'm offended and we start sinking like peter lord why because you stopped looking at your absolute you looked at the offense and you looked at what sister so-and-so said to you instead of looking at the word of god amen amen amen it's the word of god that matters not what brother someone so said i pray for brother so-and-so go talk to brother so-and-so what did you mean brother about that what sister what did you mean by this amen but you you look at the word first remember what i was saying sunday amen we need to learn how to not react when something is said to us but think before we say amen because we could cause more damage than we could to good peter amen he had to grab onto he had to hold on to that absolute in order to walk on water just like just like jesus was but eventually amen there's the grace of god it doesn't matter you might you may have failed god it does and you may have disbelieved his word you may have backslid but there's the grace of god still right there the grace of jesus christ was right there peter and just picked them right back up and he said peter oh you have little faith pick them right up now i love this part because jesus didn't carry him back to the boat you notice the bible doesn't say that he didn't carry peter back to the boat no he walked with peter back to the boat again peters continued walking on the water he was able to get back up to continue walking on the water so jesus when he restores he restores fully and he restores you back to your to your original point wherever you left jesus that's where he'll put you back amen and him both of them walk back to the boat walk to the boat jesus didn't carry him back to the boat he walked with jesus back to the boat amen because he grabbed on to that absolute praise the lord stay with an absolute have an absolute young people amen stay on something that that that's something that's firm amen the man who found the pearl of great price the bible says that he that became his absolute matthew 13 44 says again the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field that which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he has and buys that field he buys that field because he found the the pearl of great price a treasure that was hit in that field he he sold everything in order to obtain that was his absolute he sold out to that absolute in verse 45 jesus says again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he fed found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it he forgot all the other pearls around him that he had he probably had thousands of them he got rid of them he sold him because he knew this one was worth the most amen that was his absolute and he stuck to he stuck to his guns so they say praise god and second thessalonians two ver one and two says now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not so soon shaken in mind amen in other words amen be have an absolute don't be shaken so easily yeah or be troubled in ephesians 4 14 we read this this past sunday that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro back and forth yeah and carried about with every wind of tick-tock videos you could put put right over anything there carry about whatever you see on youtube carry it about whatever facebook post you see well brother so-and-so posted such and say it must be true things that brother so-and-so posted when you go back and look at him and it's not true and then it might not be him it might it might not be his fault he just shares re-shares whatever he sees on his feet amen tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of man and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive so a lot of things that you see on online it's kind of like how many receiving text messages from people that you don't even know it's been happening more and more the last year so i just play with them you know they're going to bother me so i'm just going to bother them i'm going to have a good time with them so i started having i was having a full conversation with one the other day i know my limits i mean i mean i work with technology so i know what phishing is and and scams are and i don't click on links make sure you don't click on any links but i start playing with them and i start asking them questions and when you ask certain questions to them and things like that it's like they finally leave you alone and it's actually fun i was on the phone one time with this with this man from india and he was trying to offer me something or i can't remember some tech support or something and i was at my tech support job i know about tech support and so i just started playing with

like i mean i knew he was an indian man so i was telling him i like curry and i like i know nowadays that sounds racist but i knew who i was talking about so who i was talking to so anyways just to finish but how many believe it's important to have an abstinence young people don't fall for anything stand on something and let me let me suggest to you stand on the word amen you might think you might think oh my mom and dad is just they're just old fogies and they just they're always quoting the word and always hey that that same word is what made them stand to where they are now so it must be doing something good and if you put your trust and confidence in that that's the same word that will keep you 10 years from now 15 years from now 20 years from now when you get married amen when you have children amen that same absolute that you grabbed onto when you were 15 years old amen will be the same absolute that will keep you amen when you all the way until it's time for you to go praise the lord jesus how many love the lord amen let's stand to our feet so what is it that brother marcus says absolutely sir praise the lord it's another way to say amen so be it praise the lord
