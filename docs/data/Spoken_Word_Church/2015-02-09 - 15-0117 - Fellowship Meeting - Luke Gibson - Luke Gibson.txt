church there and incidentally want to greet you from the gospel assembly there at Jasper Georgia and uh all the saints that we have there that uh you know you look look back and see what did I accomplish last year and so let it be a challenge to me you know God's got us here for reason God's got us here for reason uh some of us have come through some hard knots to get here but God's had us here for a reason and I thought what what God's got me here for I don't know the full extent of it but I want to push on out and do more this year than they did last year praise God Amen and I thought well who knows amen where the next seed's at that Soul that's out there amen remember there's one more somewhere could be across the street Brother Sam it could be next door amen we never know where he's at praise God so we opened up the doors there the Lord led us we got a little assembly there in Jasper and uh the Lord led us in that direction and it's just kind of just shared a little quick testimony um when we first begin to look for a place there God kept putting this area on my heart and uh I went around and and talked to quite a few people at own buildings and I I got to thinking you know you can put a liquor store anywhere but don't tell them you won't put a church they just kind of look at you like you fell out of a tree and so I I quite a few people uh we went and talked to and uh just soon as you name you want but a a church there brother Sunny they just kind of like shut the door on you and U so we were coming by this little area where we're at now and uh my wife said uh why don't we stop and talk to these people here I don't know who these people is and I said okay so we pulled up in the driveway and I went in and introduced myself told him who I was and and uh told him that we uh were looking for a place that God had led us to that area amen and to start a work up uh the man that runs a business him and another person they're in Partners together there they said this is an answer to our prayers they said this is what we've been looking for is a group to come in and start a church by God's grace we've been there starting on a second year now I'm going tell you what it's different praise the Lord but I tell you what I've learned a lot Amen to God and I thank God I told Brother sunny I said you know God has been so good to us yeah amen I know a lot of people

amen if you don't have anything else to pray for remember gospel assembly there in the little Jasper area pach County amen that we'll reach we've had had quite a few people that have come by from uh uh different denominations and uh it's kind of funny in a way uh I've learned you know we're hungry for the word our main thing is I want to go get the word yes but not everybody that goes Church wants the word now I found that you know I told somebody I said if we didn't yeah I told brother brother coming over you I said you know it's kind of strange I said we we started out an organized religion didn't think nothing about it and we pulled away and then started walking in the light that God gave for our day and I said you don't realize I said but now you take if we had stayed in that system long and just come out and uh you know been out of church for a long time I said you know what I would want to go back to something like that but now now the bride ain't that way you can't give them a system cuz they don't want it they want the word hello we want the word of God why amen it tells us where we come from who we are and where we going with this thing over with praise the Lord

praise the Lord the Lord how many love Jesus amen I came here to worship Jesus I was thinking about um this scripture here in Matthew Matthew 24 I've been reading a lot of news these days and um is they have a different captions and this Matthew chapter 24 here I want to read this verse 6 and he said ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars say that ye be not troubled oh oh yeah for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet amen and so this the spirit of God just moved me and I see so many things taking place we all see it yeah amen the French world is divided into half two half all right they have the one group they call them the uh the French people they said you see Charlie everywhere you look at it and another group they call it yesu Muhammad and I was thinking about it I said Lord then what about us and I don't understand French a lot but the letter I know the spirit of God just uh put on my heart yes lius that means that I am the bride amen and so when the world is divided one side is for Charlie group yes that cause so many things and the Islam Muhammad group the killing Christians lot of churches are burned up and because the Lord has already spoken about these things that these things will take place first but the prophet of God said if you don't pray the game according to the rules you're going to lose that's right and we find that they they already disqualified because they are not playing the game according to the rules of these holy scriptures and so we are very thankful that the Lord send this message all right and we can give up we have to press our way because this message is vanic we know he's the truth and uh we belong to him and I just want to thank God for uh today the Lord making it possible for me to be here and yeah sister Joseph and would like to come and sing sister Vivian they were thinking of the song they'll sing I also have a song but I don't want to take time I was going to sing uh a declaration song but it's

you'll know remember it but years ago brother George Canada brother Mike Canada brother Ernest Mo and brother Robert Tatum they were on the way to Jeffersonville Indiana to to uh a service and they

these brothers had had put out years ago right you know brother Mike Canada just passed away in October so he was the last one of the bunch that's right so we are uh we're going to try to we're going

know we sure appreciate Brother Joseph amen happen helping us amen so much you know and you know and that's been good I mean he's helped us all the way through amen I tell you what all right brother Tom what can I say amen he tried to fool me a while ago he called me and you know and he's talking to me and he said uh about not being able to make it you know and I said oh my you know that's awful oh he was so happy cuz he got me and I said you're not going to come he said yeah I'm on my way and I thought and he got here him and brother Tony got here before I did and everybody out there was shouting can you say praise the Lord I'm honored to be here I love this message very much I love brother Homer I remember one time when my wife was sick that that man of God laid his hands on her and Devils started falling and stumbling over each other and all the saints gathering around throughout my serving God I'm just so honored you know we're called to a special walk in this day this is a walk that's not compared with any other in the days of Moses god anointed Moses to get people Faith to walk on land and they couldn't hardly do it but just Caleb and a few others then Along Comes Jesus he preached tried to get people to Faith to walk on water you know Peter did it a little bit a few others did it just a little bit but not so many and now in this day God's called us to walk on the air he truly has he's asked us to have faith to to catch a Rapture to meet the Lord Jesus in the air amen that's what this message is and there's a way to do it the Bible says that he'd give the five-fold ministry for the perfecting of the Saints until we all come into that unity and this is God's way it's God's way whether we like it or not and me I like it oh hold on a second yeah yeah yeah everything you do is being watched by the way world is watching amen I love this message it's giving us Faith to receive a Rapture there's never been another day like this I don't know if you realize that they are spending Millions to try to disprove the message the internet is filled with it now and yet the people walk in the days of Noah they tried and tried to disprove Noah and it looked like they were doing a good job and suddenly here comes the Lions and the wilderbeast walking together into the ark amen my they say we have nothing to go on in this message well nothing on this Earth you don't get the message from the earth you get the message from Heaven no they're right there is nothing on this Earth to prove the message it's all in Heavenly places this message will carry a people right out of this Earth You Know in the in the days of the Bible they had too big of an army and God was cutting the Army down always chopping it down to prove his greatness now to prove his greatness he's taken a very few people and anointing them with the Holy Ghost to preach to others to sing to others to mother or to father over them and now he has and wants a many membered bride oh yeah Amen in in order to be a Navy SEAL you have to to earn the qualifications through great physical and mental exertion in order to be part of the the the Bride of Jesus Christ you you are you are given that by the great exertion and and and wonderfulness of Jesus Christ but it's still self-will whether you will do it that's right amen and there is an entrance way you know in the days of David there was just I think 40 mighty men in the Bible counts them right out and there's a little there's a little list but in this day he's calling many many more to be mighty men and women we've never had an opportunity like this in the history of this Earth to be such such uh such statues and and such pillars of faith the prophet of God said you can be like a solar system in this age you can be just as consistent as the Moon is amen my what a wonderful thing and the entrance way to this Divine faith in this day is through the hearing of the word of God it is the doctrine of this last day message which was the anointing of the Lord Jesus that will prepare a people for a Rapture and The Holy Bible says that it will be the five-fold ministry the pastors the the teachers the evangelists the it the five-fold that will uh perfect the people is it them personally no it's the words they're saying amen my words are life Jesus said amen so I can't wait for the word there's a holy presence here today do you want your life to change just receive the word amen do you want to walk as the Immortals walked in the days of the Bible where we just can't talk enough about the widow woman we can't talk enough about you know David and his sling we can't talk enough about do you want to be one of them then walk with the word and what an opportunity amen amen you'll get out of a service what you expect we're exp in great things I drove all these Miles because I'm expecting great things amen I'm more more convinced of the truth of this message than ever before you know the prophet of God says unless controversy surrounds this message it's false come on and we're worried about a little bit of controversy when our lord Jesus had the same controversy when Moses had the same controversy When anybody who's ever done anything has great controversy following them what an honor it is I'm not just barely in the message I am the message no the the Revival hasn't died in the message because I'm still here all right amen I stand as a product of God's grace just love it can't wait to hear the word Can't Wait nothing can separate us from this nothing can separate you from the love of God in Christ Jesus and if you can recognize it the love of Christ Jesus is in this message don't kid yourself it's not in the denominations while we're learning to walk on air they're still trying to figure out how many gods there are I'm sorry God bless their hearts and I hope they come to further Revelations while we are learning to receive the engrafted word and to to produce Christ manifested because of that anointing they are trying to figure out if all of this Bible's inspired oh yeah well we know all the Bible's inspired and some even around the message are trying to figure out if the prophet's message was all Inspire on oh catch the vision the further they went with Noah the better off they were all right the further they went with Paul the better off they were further we go with this message the better off we are amen we'll get out of this service what whatever we put into it what if we all knew the end would be tomorrow morning we would pull so hard on brother Luke Gibson that he'd have gray hair like brother Homer by the time he was done What If today was the last day oh yeah I still remember this day a long time ago maybe 18 years ago when a Baptist man received the revelation of the correct baptism and he was baptized and he come to one message service and at the end he come up for prayer because he wasn't feeling real good I say brother did you believe everything you heard preach he says I I believed it all I says you received his name I received his name I says well praise the Lord then don't worry you're healed the next day he died you know what he was healed he received the word and I don't feel bad for him I don't feel bad for anybody and I don't feel sorry for you when you go through things you're going through we're supposed to go through things it identifies you you can't walk on the air unless you slug through the mud it's just a part of it it actually identifies you when people persecute you for what you believe it actually

so we want to just open our Bible if we could to the Book of Mark chapter 2 and I have a couple of people from our church here three of them came we almost brought a a a group of 50 on a big bus and I'm glad we didn't cuzz I don't think it' had nowhere to sit and I've been in that room back there with all the food and I just about got started myself on lunch and I said well I better I've got three folks with us My Flesh and Blood sisters here and then brother Keith and sister Alice and I really don't believe they're here to fellowship with y'all I believe they're here to witness a miracle and that Miracle is for me to preach 30 minutes and it's going to ruin my reputation but I'm going do it but it's going to ruin my reputation they're going to go back home tell them he can preach 30 minutes so amen but you pray for me I am I don't know how to say it but I'm fighting four kidney stones and I'm fighting it right now and I got a lot of blood coming out so you just pray for me the Lord help me amen Mark chapter 2 I want to begin with verse 13 and I want to read down to verse 20 mark 2:3 13 and he speaking of Jesus went forth again by the seaside and all the multitude resorted unto him and he taught them and as he passed by he saw Levi the son of alfus sitting at the receip of custom and said unto him follow me and he arose and followed him and it came to pass that as Jesus sat at meat in his house many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his dis deciples for there were many and they followed him and when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners they said unto his disciples how is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and Sinners and when Jesus heard it he saith unto him they that are whole have no need of a physician but they that are sick I came not to call the righteous but Sinners to repentance and The Disciples of of John and of the Pharisees used to fast and they come and said unto him why do the Disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast but thy disciples fast not and Jesus said unto them can the children of the Bride chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them then shall they fast in those days let's just bow our head for a moment of prayer and on my way here I got a call from uh home about a brother that elderly gentleman brother Homer knows him tomorrow they're talking about taking his foot off and they ask us as a church just to pray for him so let's just bow our heads father what a great privilege it is this afternoon Lord to be in your divine presence just feel such a wonderful atmosphere here and Lord as we bow our hearts now in your presence we just call upon you to go to our brother Lord in the hospital there father you see his need Lord in that foot oh God we believe this afternoon you're the same yesterday today and forever and we pray oh God that you touch our brother Lord may you bring a complete healing father to that gentleman Lord that he wouldn't have to lose that foot oh God that's it's not your will Lord your will is to heal the sick and The Afflicted we pray that you'd touch him now Lord we pray oh God that you just move in this service these next few moments May the Holy Spirit take the word of God now and open it to our hearts we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church says amen God bless you you may be seated I certainly appreciate the testimonies that we heard and I want to just take my stand with our brothers to say that I Believe by God's grace we have a perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication amen I I certainly do not listen to this message to find fault with it I listen to it because I believe it's almighty God that came down in this hour amen I do not believe that this message is the thoughts of William brandom expressed I believe it's the thoughts of almighty God expressed through William brandom amen so we certainly appreciate the Lord for that I always have a problem with a man that says brother bam was a prophet uh but then he went off the word I don't know how in the world what kind of prophet they have but a prophet is a Divine interpreter of the word of God so I certainly believe that amen so we sure appreciate the Lord and I've got a hurry brother Homer told me I got 30 minutes so I'm going to obey the pastor amen so in our text this afternoon we find that Jesus is in the center of controversy once again it's kind of amazing that Jesus seems to be consistently in controversy with a certain crowd in his day and Jesus's problem with the controversy was not with Sinners but it was always with the religious crowd specifically speaking this afternoon the scribes and the Pharisees because they were on one end of the spectrum and Jesus represented another end of the spectrum Jesus represented Grace Jesus represented truth Jesus represented Liberty the Pharisees represented law they represented Traditions they represented bondage so they were on two different ends of the spectrum it's amazing that the sinner is not what ever ever gave Jesus his problem it was always the religious crowd that gave Jesus his problem Jesus seemed at different times would be in the he would always have to stand in the middle of the of the religious crowd in the center brother bam said it was The Sinner that gave Jesus his reputation Jesus came into this world to be a savior so whenever he met a sinner he met someone that actually could make up his reputation we find in John chapter 8 for a minute that they brought a woman that had been caught in the act of adultery and there's no question to me that she was caught in that act that's probably the truth she was caught in that act but what's always strange to me is when those men brought that woman to Jesus my question has always been was where was the man where was the man and I've upten wondered if the man may have been one of the children what of their sons but Jesus stood there and the scripture says that he knelt down and he wrote something in the sand and whenever he wrote In The Sand the scripture said one by one from the eldest to the youngest they walked away and when Jesus lifted his head he said woman where is thy accusers she said I don't have any accusers he said neither do I condemn thee but go and sin no more Jesus didn't come to condemn The Sinner Jesus Come To Save The Sinner can you say Amen it wasn't the sinner that crucified Christ it was the religious crowd that crucified Christ it's the religious crowd that's always had the problem with the word they didn't have the problem with the tradition they had the problem with the word and Jesus was the word made flesh for that hour can you say Amen the very God think about about this the very God that the scribes and Pharisees claimed they believed in the very book that they read from that very God that they claim they believed in was standing in front of them in a human Veil and they failed to recognize who it was they claimed they believed the god the Bible but what they didn't realize was the god that they came to believe in became flesh and was dwelling right among them and they failed to recognize who he was it was always the religious crowd that Jesus had his problems with we find first of all in the text they had a problem with who Jesus was eating with said how is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and with Sinners that was their first problem is was who he was eating with so they confronted him concerning that but now the question arises that I want to present to you today is why Jesus was eating with this crowd the issue was not just who he was eating with but why he was eating with them Jesus ate with Sinners he ate with publicans and that was their first problem the second problem was why he ate with them and then they came to him always that religious I crowd seems to have and I'm not speaking anybody specifically here but that religious crowd always has that very arrogant Spirit to the word Jesus in my humble opinion was probably the most humblest man that ever lived he was God failed as a man one day they said to Jesus said John chapter 10 said thou being a man makest thyself God I got news for you Jesus was not a man making himself God he was God who made himself a man and the scripture said when he became a man he was found and fashion as a man he he became obedient under death even the death of the Cross Jesus came this Earth he didn't come as a know at all he come as a humble man but he was the word made flesh and dwelt among us but in our text I want to hurry with this Jesus is confronted with the Disciples of John the Baptist now you got to remember it was their man that introduced Christ so there was a group here that was caught between John's message and the coming Messiah there was a people that saw John as a prophet but couldn't see the prophecy fulfilled they saw the prophet that foran but they couldn't see the transition from the prophet to the prophecy now just hold on and watch this now it was not only the Disciples of John the Baptist but it was also the Pharisees and now the Pharisees were fair you see and they hung out with a crowd who was sad you see one crowd was self-righteous and they were very arrogant in that another crowd was very sad cuz they didn't believe in the supernatural angels of the resurrection and if I didn't believe in the Supernatural I'd be very sad today too if I didn't believe in the resurrection and I didn't believe in the Holy Ghost and I didn't believe the Pres of God was Among Us I'd be a very sad individual myself if I didn't believe that God still healed the sick God still cast out Devils God still gives people the Holy Ghost if I didn't believe that I'd be a very sad individual today but I'm so glad there's still a group of people on the face of the Earth that believes he's the same yesterday today and forever and believes what this Bible said it's still true today amen but they came to Jesus I'm sorry if I knocked that down I've had to pay for pre pull pits where I preached they had a problem with who Jesus hung out with well matter of fact they invited Jesus I've always thought it was strange how Jesus would pass through a place like Levi and speak to him rep Peter and speak to him and they drop their Nets and follow him man said at the receipt a custom he was a it was a I just say it he was a tax collector I've always wonder how in the world Tax Collectors get saved but Levi was a tax collector he drops what he's doing and he follows him you stud the scripture very closely the scripture said that Levi forsook all then rose up and followed Jesus I've always wondered how in the world did he he'd have to raise up first then forsake all but Levi turned loose of everything in his heart there was something about that call that voice maybe you can't explain it but you know that when God's voice spoke to you there's something in you brother listen there's not a man living today that can explain everything the Bible say explain everything the message said but there's something in our hearts that knows when we heard God's voice something in here was K to that voice brother when I heard these tapes the first time and 1988 and they played the serpent seed message to me I real didn't take me long to realize I was hearing more than a man it wasn't just William brandom it was God himself Val a man speaking to this age amen church so they came to Jes let me hurry they came to Jesus and said why is it now we know you eat with them why Jesus each with publicans and sinners but the question came up in verse 18 that the Disciples of John fast and the Pharisees fast and he said but thy disciples fast not now look brother if people are going to be critical they going to find if they listen if they can find something about Jesus to criticize they're certainly going to find something about this message if they can find something about our Lord who was God veiled in a man if they could criticize him certainly they would criticize Malachi 4 certainly they would criticize the children whose Hearts have been turned back to the faith of the apostolic fathers but Verse 18 says and The Disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast on let me let me get my thought in here quickly in the Greek language the ideal is this that they was observing a fast at that time and this is what is amazing very critical as long as they believe they're doing it and so they they were caring remember Jesus just come from Matthews where he feasted with the publicans and you know Levi which really is Matthew and here Jesus is there with the tax collector and the Publican he's sharing a meal with their his companions and his Cog Lees because Matthew was so convinced of who Jesus was he wanted others to hear This Man Called Jesus I don't know about you Brothers sister but when I heard this message I wanted everybody to believe this message matter of fact I believed that I was going to take this message to the Pentecostals and they would receive this message oh was I in a big for surprise but I thought I could you know why cuz brother B said when a man gets convinced about what he believes he gets concerned about other people our desire really is not to see anybody lost Jesus didn't want to see nobody lost the scripture said God didn't even desire to see anybody lost he desired that men would be saved Hallelujah we don't take pleasure in the fact that people go to hell matter of fact I don't even believe God sends people to hell I believe they send themselves to Hell by rejecting God's provided way do you believe that so the Pharisees here came to Jesus and wondered why are we fasting Disciples of John are fasting but you and your disciples are not fasting notice this but y'all's feasting this crowd now now fasting is very important we're going to see what it what what involves here because the only scriptural commandment by God that these Pharisees were really following was the practice of fasting once a year it was in the Old Testament called the day of atonement now remember their fasting under a type that's pointing to Future fulfillment and so they would fast once a year we call it Young compor when the Jews were uh commemorating the day when their sins were forgiven really they weren't they were covered but Faith they were looking for the day to come when the Forgiveness of sins would come now remember when they fasted under this uh day of atonement it was a day that their the scripture said it was the remembrance of sins every time they made an offering it would remind them of sin next year another sacrifice another remembrance of sins but if they could have only understood here stood a man that would wipe out the remembrance of sins where God would say thy sins and iniquities will I remember no more but let me just tell you this quickly it it is not really possible that a man or a woman said in this building could forget every sin they committed I can still tell you things I done but yet I believe that they're under the blood of Christ listen it ain't important what I remember and what I can forget it's important what he can remember and what he can forget and he said under the blood of Christ your sin your iniquity will I remember no more it's not about what I forget it's about what God forgets it got to the place that the Pharisees their fasting evolved to a place where they fasted twice a week once was Monday once was Thursday and they fasted from 6:00 a.m. to 6: p.m. and after 6:00 p.m. they could eat anything they wanted to eat now I come out of a Pentecostal church we fasted every week we fasted seven days 21 days 28 days 40 days I even shaved my head one time and won't ever do that again laid in a room in sackcloth and Ashes burnt newspaper rubbed it on my head fasting trying to find now look you just watch where this goes we're fasting for something asking God for something that was standing right in front of us fasting was mning feasting meant there's a celebration going on come on the problem between this crowd and the crowd that was following Jesus Is This Crowd couldn't identify what present tense word was being fulfilled they were still fasting for something oh God send it send it send it send it and it was already standing there you'll see this in just a minute you might as well move that thank you buddy Luke 18 Jesus talks about the fellow down the temple another guy over there's got his head down he's all humble and this Pharisees sing over his head up to the can you imagine can you can you realize a man people with such Pride yet they're so far from the word is not even funny so arrogant but missing the word of the hour stand right in front of them he's down the tell this is what he said told God I fast twice a week I give ties of all that I possess because it got to the place that they did Fast twice a week and he let's think about this he was telling God his credentials you think I want to come before almighty God and point to one credential I got brother I don't want to stand with him and point to anything I ever done I want to point to what Christ has did as a matter of fact you know that crowd and I don't know if you can accept this or not but that is granted eternal life and white Throne judgment when he says you did this this and this they didn't know they did it the only crowd Jesus reject was the ones that come up there and said we did this this and this and this all in thy name depart from me you work me I never knew you so you don't want to come in his presence telling him what you did I don't even come today telling God what I did I come telling God what he did this is what you did you died at Calvary you kept your word you sent Christ you sent a prophet and ain't what I did is what Christ has done the bride don't stand here in this end time pointing to her own Works she points to the finished work of Christ at Calvary where God took full responsibility for every man woman boy and girl can you say praise the Lord now let me just tell this on I got to hurry Jes Jesus was not anti- fasting no no more than he was anti- praying or anti-g giving what Jesus was against was why you do what you do Jesus was more or less concerned with a man's motive why he does what he does matter of fact in Matthew 6 when the King was teaching Kingdom principles and he be to to talk about fasting and praying he said first of all Matthew 61 take he that you do not your arms before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your father which is in heaven he comes down to verse six he said but thou when thou prayest enter in thy closet not like that fell in Luke 18 down in the temple with his head in the air telling God all he did and he want to be recognized but in your closet when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which see in things shall reward thee openly by the way that was one of the scriptures that the angel Lord C our Prophet when it come to third pool of his ministry verse 16 he drops down he said moreover when you fast not if you fast but when you fast not if you pray but when you pray Christians pray Christians fast but we don't pray and fast for the same reason these bunch of Hypocrites did he said now watch as the Hypocrites of sad countenance for they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto men to fast you've seen them what's wrong brother nothing why you looking that way oh I just just fasting that's over you might as well just go get you a big hamburger forget it buddy of M one time went up to West Virginia on a 40-day fast about the 21st day we made it after the 21st day I was ready knock his head off he said God show you anything I said yep hamburgers and french fries and mashed potatoes I said I'm ready to get out of here I said longer I'm out here I'm losing love of God I'm ready to beat your head in said we ain't in the will of God he said they appear under me the fast verily I say to you they have their reward now watch but thou in thy fastest anoint thy head was thy face in other words you're not looking for man's acknowledgement you don't care what a man patch on the back or not you're interested in what God thinks about it now keep watching you'll see how this unfolds then he said that thou appear not un men to fast but thy father which seeth in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly everybody say praise the Lord so Jesus listen this is beautiful is not objecting to fasting he's not objecting to giving he's not objecting to men praying he's objecting to the fact that their religious experience has took the joy the purpose of why you do what you do they there there are traditions mixed this thing completely up and that's why Jesus was against what they're doing now Watch What Happens the Pharisees fasted intentionally whiten their faces Jesus said they wanted to declare to others that they were mournful well you're going to see just in a minute that that's the evidence they missed their day in its message I'll read it right from the prophet here in just a second read religious individuals they were they wanted to show that they were morally religious and sober now listen to me Jesus had the ability to do like when they come in contact with Jesus it wasn't coming in contact with a typical individual that day because Jesus had the ability to look past this and he could stand there and say outwardly you look this way but inwardly you're full of dead men's bones they stand before man now that before they ever said the word he already knew what their thoughts was that's the scripture Jesus knew what they was thinking but they wern't standing just before anybody they were standing before the god of Heaven veiled in the form of a man they could not hide their thoughts finally the scripture says Jesus said they bind heavy burdens Grievous to be born and lay upon men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers look the truth is they couldn't do it and neither could anybody else the only thing they done was privately lived a hypocritical life publicly tried to act like they were so righteous I seen the same thing back in the Pentecostal church and I'm not condemning them I'm just simply telling the facts they tell you not to go to the doctor and the first time their kid got sick they go out of town and take their child to the doctor that's hypocrisy thank God for a message that reveals the truth of those things can you say Amen church so here we find the Pharisees were appalled that Jesus was feasting on a day that to them he should have been fasting they couldn't understand how Jesus and his disciples would be feasting eating down there with number one not only eating but look who you're eating with and here we are down here keeping a fast and there y'all are keeping a feast I want to just give a thought to you now to enforce the point hammered home Jesus gives three illustrations to answer their question but I'm only going to use one this this afternoon to contrast their I'm GNA say it dead legalistic mournful religious form and activity with the liberty and the joy of the grace that's found in Christ let me give them to you Jesus essentially was saying this life in me is meant to be a wedding not a funeral let me let me give you example now now I don't know about you but I believe matter of fact I I know you believe this I know brother the Homer does that the same Ministry that Jesus had has repeated again in our day he told us that Luke 17:30 the son of man be revealed again now I do not believe that William Brandon was the son of man I believe he was a son of man no problem with that cuz he's a Prophet but the only the son of man is our Lord Jesus Christ can you say Amen his ministry repeated again in our day now we come up through if I could say it up through the stock tassel shook the shuck protects the seed you ever notice what God did with brother brandham brother brandham started out as a Baptist Minister nothing against him my father started out as a Baptist matter of fact I find sometimes fundamentally the Baptist know more about the scriptures than the Pentecostals they they they they fundamentally know what the scripture says about a Believer more than the Pentecostals do brother bam actually brother bam compared them together like one knew what was in the bank but couldn't write the check the other could write the check but didn't know it was in the bank so people always ask me are you Baptist said no you pente said no I'm bapticostal I'm I'm both of them together did you know brother B was a Baptist now technically according to Nature God could not bring brother brandham as a Baptist into the seed pay attention to me a minute because the Baptist was back down here in the stalk and tassel remember when the poen dropped off from the great missionary age John Smith part of the Baptist Church that's where it was formed so it would be against nature to take that Prophet straight into the seed form so what does he have to do he has to force him into the Pentecostal age you say Force absolutely Force cuz when he went down there you remember brother bram's mother-in-law had a problem with brother bam going to the Pentecostal now let me just tell you this at that time the life was in the Shu that's where the life was was in the Shar and brother bab said all the life that's in the Shar has got to go in the seed so the seed has got to be in the shuck for the life to go into the seed it don't go into the stock it don't go this thing's growing up into full maturity now so he listens to his mother-in-law well y'all know the story you see how important it was to God that that Prophet go the Pentecostal he was willing to take his wife and his baby finally when sister brandom died butam called her back she said Bill I know where we made our mistake we should have never listened to Mama and said promise me now you know what brother bam did he went to the Pentecostal and listen to what brother bam says when he was down to that night and that little aged black gentleman with white ring hair around his head was preaching but B say he jumped up clicked his heels together said y'all ain't got enough room but B said these words whatever they had I needed brother there was a life that was in the Pentecostal church that had to go into the seed brother bam had to go among the Pentecostals that's where the life was and watch when he receives the life now the very shuck age has to protect that man's Ministry while it's in its infancy who received him the Pentecostals remember they said brother won't you go down here he said why don't y'all invite me it was the Pentecostals that was receiving brother Bon's Ministry especially under the first and second pool of his ministry especially the first pool now we know all the details of that how the Carl impersonators ra but let me tell you this it wasn't their it was not the Carl impersonator fault in this age that they impersonated brother bradam no no the angel of God rebuked brother bradam and said you caused it because he tried to explain the pools to him and he caused the Carl impersonators and then he got rebuked and said on this third one don't you tell to nobody and then the prophet said on this third pool there will be no impersonation this third pool is that right but now watch they protect his ministry young prophet stand there hold people's hands tell them to re e and by the way not one time ever missed it I come out Pentecostal Church where they hit and miss hit and miss hit and miss I've had them tell people you got back trouble and they say no I don't have no back trouble bless God you're going to have back trouble that's a devil that ain't anointing of the Holy Spirit that's a Dev that's right now I won't call the names of the people that I was associated with but I can just tell you this there was a genuine anointing just like brother bam taught us in knowing the end time that was a genuine anointing those people i' never seen people pray and fast more than anybody matter of fact we didn't go a week without doing it we fasted every week and look think about that the very thing that my Pentecostal Brethren were fasting praying for it was it was already sent and they missed it you say brother Luke is that possible that's what the prophet of God says you'll see it in just a minute when they should have been over here feasting they were still fasting when they should have been over here in the present tense word let me say it like this United with Christ in an invisible Union under a marriage that were over there FAS and looking for something that God already did so finally they protected under the second pull the very very shook that protected William Brandon's Ministry in its empathy he be to have to prophesy against the very shook that protected him cuz he seen where they were going toward organization and he begins to prophesy against and brother bam says this under the Sixth trumpet the Pentecostal rejected the Bible and he said under the second pool he prophesied against their organizations then the shuck begin to pull away so the seed could get into the pr look they didn't reject Christ under the Third pull to open the word that wasn't for them that was for us they rejected Christ's ministry under the second pool of his ministry they turned down Christ did they stop fasting absolutely not that they stop praying absolutely not they call individual fast they call corporate fast but here was Jesus's whole problem he says life now that the word standing here now what yall have looked for for 4,000 years since the fall of Adam here he is while you should be feasting y'all still fasting for something that's that's already here while you should be at a wedding you're at a funeral see watch this because watch some of the crowd this is amazing to me but some of the crowd that was there that day was called the Disciples of John well if they don't understood do you know what John was called John was called the friend to the the bridegroom the bridegroom was standing there there was a feast going on look you call this a fellowship meeting so guess what we're here to Fellowship that's like people going down to the ball game and then sitting there like they can't stand being there I was like man if you're that religious go home somebody hits a good ball and they like clap for my good you're at a ball game you got to get in the spirit of the thing I'm sorry but I tell us all over the world John's Daddy back there when I first come to South Carolina he was the song leader and I I got him beside one day I said look brother we we can't keep doing this I said what you mean can't keep doing this I said can't keep doing this I said you're a black man acting like a white man I can't stand it I said you hung around these white people so long they stole your soul from you I said black people don't sing out their nose they sing from their soul Something's Got a chance well he said well I'm I'm just not an emotional fell I said okay I I'll buy that one I didn't believe it so one day he invites me down to watch Clemson University which I don't go across street watch them but I went my wife and I said we're going to go we got our orange and purple on we we I mean we just matched Right Down the Line you couldn't tell you would have thought we was a Clinton we was a bunch of Hypocrites we like none of them and I sat there and it was a basketball game brother Rudy sat here Valentino whatever you want to call him know who you're talking to if you're talking to his mama he's Valentino do not call him Rudy his wife said here GW my wife said here and I said here Clipson was losing boy got the ball dribbled down in the court slammed and went ahead by one point Rudy this non-emotional guy comes up about that high off the ground W I just kind of lean my head over I said you are in trouble Sunday no you're emotional but it's if you love if you're in love with what you're doing then you get emotional over it and this what I got to say if you come to church and tell me you ain't got emotional maybe you don't really like why you're here this ain't a funeral service this is church this is a resurrected Christ and brother bam says we ought to be the most happiest people there is on the face of the Earth if anybody's got a right to worship God we got a right to worship God let me hurry with this watch watch this just for a second it was it was the fact that a wedding was going on a feast was going on there was Fellowship there was Joy supposed to be taking place and then here was people over here they didn't know why he was eating with them people didn't know why that they're not fasting and got their sad face like everybody else and and I'm me the only difference was was one what let I if I could say this way one wasn't just everybody say you see the message look it ain't just we see the message we are the message Jesus what they're trying to just show a message he was the message lived out look brother I'm not in the message the message is in me and you know what I mean I don't mean that to be smart I'm just telling you it this ain't another organization every might joining a message church if you look if if there's something in this message that we could preach or say or the prophet would say that would run you out this message get out of here quit wasting our time your day will come you'll manifest what you are but if you're a real believer and this Holy Ghost has called you this message daring a devil in hell can talk you out of it somebody talks you in somebody talks you out of it but if the Holy Ghost by Sovereign Grace reveals it to you they the devil hell take it out of you Hallelujah brother my whole deal right now is this I do not understand everything brother bradam said but neither did the disciples but what was the difference between the disciples staying with Jesus and all the rest of them walking away it was not the disciples understood Eat My Flesh and drink my blood the difference was not understanding the difference wasn't knowing who said it that was the difference cuz if you know who said it then it don't matter what he says you believe what God says that was the difference between the disciples and the rest of them that walked away and here's my deal it's ain't William brandom revealed this is Jesus Christ revealed one of his forms with the prophet of God and today the bride of Christ is still a manifestation of the unveiling of God Amen not trying to believe the message either Believe it or you don't do you believe that listen what brother B said let me hurry brother H I'm trying I'm almost done but B says think about the message is quoting from recognizing your day in its message he said what time is it brother he's asking question what time is it brother what time is it Minister look there was just as many preachers that couldn't see this message it was ly and they studied the Bible every day I got tremendous I'm talking about men I love honestly today I still love them I'm not against those Brothers but and I think myself God how would you show an 18y old boy this me and you couldn't show a man that's been studing studying the Bible for 40 years but you can't say well brother Luke you fasted into this message you prayed no I didn't fast and prayed and nothing I got here cuz God before the foundation world for knew that I would see this message if we see this message the only difference Us and Them can't see it is The Sovereign Grace of God you ain't pointing to nothing else but God's grace but B said do you see the time of the day and the sign you're living under can you understand it do you see it he's asking that question then he said everywhere now there's no Revival now look brother bram's definition of VI Revival and the and the denominal definition of Revival is two different definitions to be truthful with you just to stir is not a Revival look we claim we had Revival every summer at the youth camps and you know what every year it was the same people getting saved over and over and over and over and over and over I got saved so many times in Pentecost baptized re baptized many time it wasn't funny it's just true really technically Revival is Sovereign God sends it he red destinat it he'll raise up a man set his anointing on and God would deal with that man they no man goes to heaven and gets a message God comes down from heaven with the m he gets a man Moses said don't say who send to Heaven who call across the sea bring back where he said no the words not thee in thy mouth and thy heart the word of faith which we preach Moses didn't go get the Commandments the Commandments come and got Moses Paul didn't go get the New Testament Revelation the Revelation come and got Paul amen and William didn't go get this message this message came and got William bradam and the same Pillar of Fire that wrote the Bible days of Moses and Paul has now been sent this day to interpret the Bible to us that's not men that's God himself picking his men and using his men it's Sovereign Grace brother B said listen I'm closing everywhere now there's no Revival everybody's complaining ministers are crying I was reading one of the outstanding papers that comes into the church a very fine paper brother sister more The Herald of his coming one of the finest paper in the field The Herald of his coming but they hardly will print anything unless it's fast pray fast pray watch you see it all the time fast pray sound the trumpet how many reads it you know you see it all the time fast pray fast pray how many you hear it fast pray fast pray we're going to have a great breaking of the day there's a great thing going to happen all of you pray pray pray pray we're not too late yet I heard that my whole life like another year 2015 here we get a slogan for it and that boy look they kept hanging the carrot front of you and just about soon as you think you got it it's gone next year next year next year you never do get it but B said now watch this what said why do they do that why do they do that they want a great awaken they're crying believing that there will be an Awakening they're good people why is that what if have they done they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride see by being a Christian they feel the pool of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done see here the thing is they're fasting for it and it's already there they're looking for it and it's already came look do you know most of the world today is still looking for the Lord himself to come down from heaven to shout they still sing about and he's already came down from heav with a shout a message has already why do you think you're here a message came down in this Ag and called you out of those denominations back to the word of God Amen they have not recognized it what's been done what's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen but they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you let me just tell you this weddings and funerals don't mix fasting and feasting don't mix now I'm gonna say this to you John the Revelator we call him the Revelator but John in the Book of Revelation chapter 5 Saul one sitting on a throne and in his book in his hand was a book closed John said I wept much y he was weeping because no man had claimed a book but then you remember the story out behind the throne here come a lamb Don one of the elders announced and by the way you know somebody said bro Luke all that emotion and all that Joy you talk about and all that clapping and singing y'all do and you know that's just a bunch of babies in the message really I said really kind of strange I said when the Revelation 5 was open the Bible said John saw the lamb coming take the book he screamed and hollered and the Bible don't say 4 and 20 babies it said 4 and 20 Elders what happened his mourning turned to Joy when the lamb came and took the book and broke the seals it went from mourning to rejoicing brother if there's anybody that's got a right to be rejoicing seeing the identified word understanding we're being united with Christ now in a marriage not over there the marriage is taking place here this group ought to be rejoicing over the things of God do you believe that say Amen so here it is in closing right here Jesus was different it wouldn't have mattered be honest with you it wouldn't have mattered if they're going to be critics they're going to be critics John came not eating and drinking and look what they said about him then Jesus came eating and drinking and and look what they said about him the critics are always going to criticize but the difference is is one saw the identified word and one did not see it one look doesn't mean that one wasn't a believer One was still looking for it and one done recognize that it was already there can you say praise the Lord let me let me close on this thought here I think my 30 minutes is up weddings was the most happiest time in the Jewish lady's life that's a little different ours we get married to be honest with you we don't want to Feast when I got married to my wife reception forget y'all I'm gone it was stupid to me I said why we got to go down there and eat with people I'm not wor eating their food I want to go with you forget that bunch of junk but a wedding in that time was when the man and woman got married they didn't run off they stayed around about a week seven days and they did nothing but feast and they and they loved it matter of fact it was such this is beautiful it was such a feast that the rabbis passed laws that the people were were they didn't have to keep the laws even when it came to fasting during that time if it was a waiting on on feast going on you you could lay aside your laws and just get all involved in the feast I don't how man can't see that brother sister this is a feast you said BR look what are you feasting on a seven full course meal brother B said for all seven seals have been opened this is the beautiful thing about this message you know we go out to eat all the time I do I go out to eat all the time and it's been showing lately so now I started exercising brother Dale was telling me about his daddy's a and I said does he does he exercise said no he he just works oh yeah that's that old nasty four-letter word them Old-Timers knew about that stuff these young fellas don't know a whole lot about that I wife and I were out to eat the other day and she's sitting across the table you look around the place and everybody's got a phone out so me and her were just sitting there she looking at the men I thought well might as well join the club I got my phone out and text her I said how you doing she got her phone out looked at him she looked across table I'm doing pretty good that's just about the way it is you go out the restaurant they lay a menu down and you you check the menu out and you pick and choose what you want when you come this message you don't do that God lays it all out there on the table and says now eat come Feast with the King cuz everything he put on this table is what you're going to need to change your body and you're going to eat your way to a body change this ain't a funeral this ain't a morning time this ain't a Mor this is church this is the presence of Christ This is a full seven course meal and I believe the bride of Christ amen can say Amen to every word of God hallelujah [Applause] there may be times that brother Homer come on and musicians whoever there may be times you have to put this message in and you might have to chew a little while it might take you a couple days to digest it but you keep feeding on it and it'll get down on here and it might be bitter but after a while it'll become sweet and it'll start living itself out through you amen this ain't a message that just gets up here this a meage gets in here and it becomes lived out becomes not just a message as as you pack but it becomes a living manifestation of God's word for this hour amen let's Stand Together father we thank you so much today Lord for our fellowship Lord just to think that this is just a
