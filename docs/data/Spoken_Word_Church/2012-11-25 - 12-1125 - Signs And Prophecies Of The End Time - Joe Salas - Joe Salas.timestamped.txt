[0:08] so they go all around the world they
[0:10] can't find anybody they ask me
[0:16] really doing a good job he's taking us
[0:18] last week he took us to the stars the
[0:20] galaxies and
[0:24] but uh today i'm going to bring it down
[0:27] down to earth a little bit
[0:31] i'm just uh
[0:33] speculating
[0:34] expect a sin on the beast compared to
[0:36] brother bob so
[0:39] uh i'm gonna try and talk about signs
[0:42] and prophecies of the end time
[0:45] so let's go to matthew 12 38 to 40.
[1:05] then serna describes and the first
[1:08] answer saying master we will see a sign
[1:10] from thee but he answered and said unto
[1:13] them an evil and adulterer generation
[1:16] seek that to sign
[1:18] and there's no sign be given to it but
[1:21] the sign of the prophet jonas
[1:23] for jonas was
[1:25] three days and three nights in that
[1:27] whale's belly so shall the son of man be
[1:29] three days and three nights in the heart
[1:32] of the earth
[1:33] the man i never shall rise in judgment
[1:36] with this generation and shall condemn
[1:38] it because
[1:39] they repented
[1:42] repented that preaching and join us and
[1:44] be hell
[1:45] and greater than jonas is here
[1:48] and brother and sister
[1:50] brother brother i said there was a sign
[1:52] of the resurrection
[1:54] okay let's go to matthew
[1:58] 24 3.
[2:08] 243
[2:09] and as he said upon the man all of this
[2:11] disciples came onto him probably saying
[2:14] tell us when shall these things be and
[2:17] what shall be the sign
[2:18] of the coming and of the end of the
[2:20] world
[2:21] and at the bottom of schofield bible
[2:23] scofield kind of explains it he said
[2:26] when shall these things be
[2:29] said the destruction of that temple and
[2:31] the city that's one
[2:33] and
[2:35] the second and third is a two-fold he
[2:37] said
[2:38] and what shall be the sign of the coming
[2:40] and at the end of the age
[2:43] it has a double interpretation
[2:44] interpretation it says the
[2:47] the character of the age verses
[2:49] international conflicts famous
[2:52] pestilence and persecutions
[2:54] and the false prophet
[3:09] in the maze in the message the voice of
[3:11] the sign programmer said uh
[3:14] says now we find out that god gave most
[3:16] of the signs to improve
[3:19] claims and callings and every true sign
[3:21] every true sign that's sent from god as
[3:23] the voice behind it
[3:25] says no don't fail this is my last
[3:27] lesson on this every true sign now we
[3:30] have signs that that's not from god
[3:33] satan can almost impersonate anything
[3:36] there is but a true sign sent from god
[3:39] has the voice of god behind
[3:41] god said to moses if you won't believe
[3:44] the voice of the first sign then do this
[3:46] other sign before them
[3:48] and they they don't hear that just take
[3:50] water and pour it upon the ground
[3:53] hear this and that was a sign that they
[3:56] was
[3:57] that they would be drenched in their own
[3:59] blood
[4:05] so
[4:05] god gives signs to attract
[4:07] the attention of his people
[4:09] signs to attract the attention of god's
[4:11] people
[4:12] and watched the voice that followed sign
[4:14] was a scriptural voice
[4:16] he said i have heard the cries of my
[4:18] people and their drawings because of the
[4:20] taskmasters
[4:22] and remain and i remember my promise
[4:24] that settles it
[4:26] i remember the promise that was a
[4:28] scriptural sign and i'm sending you down
[4:30] there
[4:31] they come down to deliver them and i'm
[4:34] sending you
[4:36] see but god is trying to attract the
[4:38] prophet now and he gives him a sign and
[4:40] a voice that followed the sign was a
[4:42] scriptural voice
[4:44] he said i have seen that people have
[4:46] heard or they're crying i remember my
[4:48] promise
[4:49] now god
[4:51] is going to speak by his promised word
[4:53] he must send his prophet for the word
[4:56] comes to the prophet the bible
[4:58] said god said himself that he does not
[5:00] nothing until he reveals it unto his
[5:04] servants and prophet
[5:06] see and then the sign is given and the
[5:08] scripture
[5:09] is
[5:10] identified that's the voice of the sign
[5:16] he said again the comment of a prophet
[5:17] is assigned did you know that the
[5:19] commander of the prophet to the age is a
[5:21] sign
[5:22] i said i don't mean a doctor a divinity
[5:24] i don't mean a loyal pastor some good
[5:27] person
[5:28] that is fine
[5:29] name is god's servant
[5:31] but a prophet is a sign the bible says
[5:34] and what's the sign of it
[5:36] it's a sign that his word is fixing to
[5:38] fulfill be fulfilled by the voice of the
[5:40] prophet's sign
[5:43] notice the comment of a prophet that
[5:45] warning sign
[5:47] of judgment at hand
[5:48] did you know that judgment judgment is
[5:51] ready to strike
[5:52] if there's a prophet in the land
[5:54] remember he is certainly
[5:56] first cut to be vindicated
[5:59] by god and
[6:01] the word for that day and that he does
[6:03] the sign and that watch that sign
[6:06] what it predicts he said it comes to
[6:08] pass and hear him
[6:10] and if it doesn't come to pass forget it
[6:12] it's got to be a scriptural sign that he
[6:14] gives
[6:16] he said noah was a prophet on the land
[6:20] in the land of a sign of coming judgment
[6:23] moses was a prophet in the land the sign
[6:26] of the coming judgment
[6:27] elijah the prophet in the land of common
[6:30] judgment john
[6:32] a prophet in the land of sign
[6:35] coming judgment to israel they were
[6:37] already cut off
[6:39] another sign what what are the signs the
[6:42] sign is to attract attention
[6:45] and get the elected ready
[6:47] and out of the way before the judgment
[6:49] strikes
[6:50] that's what we want to do get ready for
[6:52] the judgment strikes
[6:54] that's what noah did he got directed
[6:57] ready the rest of them and what does he
[6:59] do the sign and the boys of the sign
[7:02] condemns the unbeliever and gets him
[7:04] ready for judgment
[7:06] gets the elected ready for the escape
[7:09] that's what the sign is that's what the
[7:11] signs are given for for the coming
[7:13] judgment
[7:14] to elect them i see it
[7:17] in the very judgment they say moses
[7:18] condemned the world
[7:20] he's preaching it gets the electorate
[7:22] what is elected ready for
[7:25] when they see a god sign
[7:27] send sign they look back in the
[7:29] scripture and see that
[7:31] they're supposed to be there yeah here
[7:33] it is what is it pending judgment
[7:36] then the elected listens to the voice
[7:39] but the unelected ignores and said
[7:42] nonsense
[7:43] go on we'll take the same old school
[7:46] see that's the way they did in that they
[7:48] used to look through that
[7:49] that's the way they did in the days of
[7:50] wesley that's the way they do now
[7:53] the way they always go
[8:08] and the message that true sign that's
[8:10] overlooked said
[8:12] man has sought for signs all the way
[8:14] from pharaoh until today and jesus
[8:17] and jesus told us
[8:18] a time there will be secrets of signs
[8:22] and said that a wickedness and
[8:23] adulterous generation would seek after
[8:25] sign but
[8:26] yet they would receive a sign
[8:29] and that generation was to receive a
[8:31] sign of the restoration which would be a
[8:33] week
[8:35] and a week and a weekend adulterer
[8:37] generation will be given a sign of the
[8:39] resurrection
[8:41] he said even the pharisees that the day
[8:43] that jesus showed us
[8:45] he said they said show us a sign from
[8:46] heaven
[8:48] but jesus referred to them that they
[8:49] would get a sign you already got a sign
[8:52] said you can discern the skies you can
[8:54] look at the sign
[8:55] you say if it's red and lauren tomorrow
[8:57] will be fall weather
[8:59] if they would look at the sign they have
[9:02] looked at him and knew that he was god's
[9:04] sign to them
[9:05] because their prophecies concerning him
[9:08] was being fulfilled before their eyes
[9:10] but they still
[9:12] look for sign
[9:28] this day the scriptures fulfilled he
[9:30] says
[9:33] no there's a great sign the jews are in
[9:36] their homeland they have their own
[9:38] nation money army
[9:41] jesus said learn a parable of fig tree
[9:46] in the mark of the beast he said if you
[9:48] want to see what day of the month it is
[9:50] look on the calendar
[9:51] if you want to see what day
[9:53] in the season it is at the coming of the
[9:55] lord
[9:56] watch where israel is saying that's
[9:59] because time peace there she is satan in
[10:02] her own land the oldest flag in the
[10:04] world
[10:05] that six point star of david the oldest
[10:07] flag in the world flies again for that
[10:10] first time for 2500 years yes sir
[10:17] gabriel's instruction to daniel i don't
[10:19] want to
[10:20] step on
[10:22] brother dale when i am out there
[10:24] john daniel this scripture
[10:27] the seven weeks it closes
[10:29] discloses until exactly from the time
[10:32] that daniel started there until the end
[10:35] of the consummation
[10:36] he says one of the greatest timepieces
[10:39] how many heard me say if you want to
[10:41] know what day of the week it is look at
[10:43] the counter
[10:44] if you want to know what
[10:46] time we're living in what's the jews
[10:48] that's right
[10:50] that's
[10:50] there's god's calendar taken from right
[10:53] here
[10:54] any theologian any bible scholar anyone
[10:56] will tell you that
[10:58] this is the timepiece the jews
[11:13] now we're in a better greatest battle we
[11:15] ever fought but just think of israel
[11:17] from the beginning there's always
[11:18] somebody trying to start a war room you
[11:20] know
[11:22] let's go to
[11:24] first games 20.
[11:26] first one
[11:55] to 14.
[12:01] and that hadn't the king of this
[12:03] syria gather all his souls together and
[12:05] there were 30 and two kings with him and
[12:08] horses and chariots
[12:10] and he went up and we
[12:12] see samaria and warned against it and he
[12:15] sent messengers to
[12:17] ahab which he was the king of israel
[12:19] then king of israel into the city and
[12:21] said unto him god said then hayden
[12:24] thy silver and that goal is mine my
[12:26] wives also and my children even
[12:29] godless are mine and the king of israel
[12:32] answered and said my lord o king
[12:35] according to the same i'm dying and all
[12:37] that i had i'll give you everything i
[12:39] get
[12:40] everything i got i'll give it to you
[12:44] and the messengers came again and said
[12:47] thus speaketh manhattan although i have
[12:49] said unto thee saying thou shalt deliver
[12:52] me thy silver and i go and my wives and
[12:54] our children
[12:55] yet
[12:57] will i send my servants unto thee
[12:59] tomorrow about this time and they
[13:01] shall search thy house and the houses
[13:04] of our servant and hiv that whatever is
[13:07] pleasant in their eyes they shall put it
[13:10] in their hand and take it away more they
[13:12] wanted more whatever they could find
[13:14] take it
[13:15] you know
[13:17] then the king of israel called all the
[13:19] elders of the man and said mark i pray
[13:21] you and see how this man's secret
[13:24] mischief for he has sent unto me for my
[13:27] wives and for my children for my silver
[13:29] and for my goal
[13:31] and i deny him not
[13:33] and all the elders and all the people
[13:35] said unto him
[13:36] heart cannot unto him nor consent
[13:39] wherefore he
[13:40] said unto the messengers abandoned tell
[13:43] my lord the king
[13:45] all that god you sent for the
[13:47] servant at first i would do
[13:50] but this thing i may not
[13:52] do and the messengers departed and
[13:54] brought him word again
[13:56] and they had ben hayden stand unto him
[13:59] and said
[14:00] the gods do still sow unto me and more
[14:03] also in the dust that samara
[14:05] satisfies for handfuls for all the
[14:08] people that follow me
[14:09] and the king of israel answered and said
[14:11] tell him let not him
[14:14] the gird on his harness boost both
[14:16] himself as he had
[14:19] that put it off and he came to pass when
[14:21] that man hadn't heard this matches
[14:23] message as he was drinking he and the
[14:26] kings and the pavilions that
[14:28] he said unto his servant set yourself in
[14:31] a ray and they said
[14:33] themselves and array against the city
[14:36] but god gives them the victory and
[14:38] behold there came a prophet unto ahab
[14:40] king of israel saying thou said the lord
[14:43] has
[14:44] not seen all this great multitude behold
[14:46] i will deliver unto thy
[14:49] dying hand this day and i shall know
[14:52] that i am the lord and i have said by
[14:54] whom and he said
[14:56] thus saith the lord even by the young
[14:58] man of the princes of the prophetesses
[15:01] that he
[15:02] said who shall order battle and he
[15:04] answer thou
[15:11] brother branham said uh well whatever
[15:13] israel uh
[15:15] so he has to read you know he's gonna
[15:17] hold him a convo but
[15:19] just like david he's still uh israel's
[15:22] still god's chosen people you know no
[15:23] matter what
[15:25] and uh
[15:27] like i said we're in a battle
[15:29] greatest battle i ever thought just
[15:31] think of them you know
[15:36] every little bitty country like right
[15:37] now they're trying to
[15:39] wipe the ezreal off the map
[15:41] i was reading on that on the on the
[15:43] right i was hurting at her in the radio
[15:44] where we were talking about it
[15:46] since they started this conflict 80 000
[15:49] missiles or bombs they've been dropping
[15:50] it israel
[15:52] that's twice as many as they did in
[15:53] world war ii
[15:55] but i think israel has that technology
[15:57] to kind of
[15:58] blow some up before they get there but
[16:00] still
[16:01] just thank you uh at your house you're
[16:03] waiting for
[16:05] any bombs come in and hit my backyard or
[16:07] hit my house or something you know so
[16:09] you know but
[16:11] god's going to take care of him
[16:22] okay
[16:24] let's go to daniel 12 4.
[16:52] um
[17:14] there
[17:18] daniel 12 4
[17:21] but thou or daniel shut up the words and
[17:23] seal the book even to the time of the
[17:25] end many
[17:27] shall run to and fro and knowledge shall
[17:30] increase
[17:34] you know me i always do the latest on
[17:35] what the laser technology so
[17:43] he said imagine a fire fighter that can
[17:45] fly a low level close air support
[17:47] missile
[17:49] mission delivering his weapons on target
[17:51] and then perform a full dog fight
[17:54] before returning to base
[17:56] imagine this level of combat flying with
[17:59] without a pilot in a cockpit a pilot
[18:03] pilotless f-16
[18:06] has become a reality but not for long
[18:10] the program was in with engineers at
[18:13] edwards at first base were well on their
[18:15] way to perfecting this pilot step 16
[18:18] when funding for the program was
[18:20] cancelled this was in the 90s so they
[18:23] probably already have it by now
[18:25] just think uh ryan has one of the little
[18:27] airplanes that he fights with remote
[18:29] control
[18:30] but these with a click of a mouse you
[18:32] can just
[18:34] send it with no no pilot in it and uh
[18:36] i don't know if they said uh
[18:39] when the future is coming they would
[18:40] have the airliners delta whatever no
[18:43] pilot on it
[18:44] but i don't think they would like that
[18:46] who's going to say it
[18:47] look i'm not bored israel and so-and-so
[18:50] we've been landing this for 20 minutes
[18:52] so how's that going to sound
[19:06] a lot of the technology they're already
[19:07] using it you know the enemy afghanistan
[19:11] they uh
[19:13] they dropped supplies and a helicopter
[19:15] we don't pilot on it so the technology
[19:17] is there they're using it on some but
[19:19] like i say i don't know that was in the
[19:20] 90s this uh thing right here
[19:36] y'all heard about the google car
[19:39] yeah
[19:41] uh
[19:42] the law was best it was okay and now
[19:44] let's see uh
[19:47] nevada i think was first
[19:49] and then
[19:50] california
[19:52] actually
[19:57] where's like three states it's okay for
[19:58] them to drive a
[20:00] car with no uh no driver
[20:03] like i said that technology helps but
[20:05] people that are blind by the way i was
[20:07] talking about this
[20:08] this guy that drove to taco bell in
[20:10] order and then they finally the people
[20:12] realized that he was blind
[20:15] and no you know
[20:18] blind
[20:20] and actually
[20:27] i think they only had like two accidents
[20:28] one time a driver was driving it and
[20:31] when the google car
[20:32] got an accident that that driver wasn't
[20:35] there it wasn't driving it was driving
[20:36] by itself
[20:37] the google car was stuck at a stop light
[20:39] and somebody came and hit him right
[20:41] behind
[20:42] so
[20:47] but the latest technology is uh
[20:53] vehicles that communicate with each
[20:55] other
[20:57] they uh
[20:59] they use like
[21:05] cell phone towers uh
[21:08] wire sensors in the road
[21:10] so the cars ahead of you or something
[21:12] he'll let you know there's a
[21:14] ice on the road or the accident or
[21:16] something
[21:17] you know so
[21:19] so i have all the airflow in case all
[21:21] you want to look at this
[21:23] but uh
[21:25] where are we at
[21:29] because brother branham had that vision
[21:30] of the choir yeah the families playing
[21:33] games
[21:34] that would be nice
[21:38] good thing
[21:51] yeah in the message the voice of the
[21:53] sign
[21:54] he said
[21:55] i said such progress will take place i
[21:58] said see
[21:59] ottoman automobiles looking like an a
[22:01] going down the street
[22:03] there's cars going on the highway with
[22:05] some kind of a control
[22:08] they don't have to guide it i seen an
[22:10] american family playing
[22:12] checkers in the back of the car they got
[22:14] the car right now
[22:16] it they just had if they just had the
[22:19] highways to put on it what was i talking
[22:20] about the sensors oh yeah
[22:24] so she brought brother brown knew about
[22:26] all this that was coming
[22:28] you see the little volkswagen is perfect
[22:30] it's perfect like an egg just accept it
[22:32] as it is
[22:34] all the other cars could you imagine in
[22:36] 1933 what the cars
[22:38] look like now
[22:42] but uh a lot of these uh technology is
[22:45] so expensive like the f-16 that that's
[22:48] why they've canceled that yeah that
[22:50] project is so expensive you know but i
[22:53] guess google's got a lot of money i
[22:54] don't know
[22:56] okay that's it thank you thank you
[23:01] you want money first
[23:08] i
