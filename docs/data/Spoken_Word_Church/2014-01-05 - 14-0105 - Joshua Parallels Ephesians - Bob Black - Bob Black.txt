========================================

oh last time i had to i had to close it out and restart it worked nice we'll just grab the audio off of this video all right good morning everyone i'm gonna read from luke chapter two and then we're gonna go look at ephesians i got a text message from brother they got three inches and it's climbing and they gotta drive through that they went up to colorado springs their grandma yeah because that was her son you know my grandmother got run over by a reindeer i'd have got out there yesterday no it's so grounding so um by the way he wanted to put in a prayer request i told brother terrance to pray so let's let's pray before we read our scriptures real quick lord we thank you god for this day lord another day to serve you another year that you brought us through lord we thank you god for opening your word to us lord jesus god granted i pray that as our brothers and sisters travel or that you'll just be with them and watch them on the road lord and let no harm come to them lord jesus let your angel of mercy just guide them safely safely and sound lord to their destination lord i pray god that you'll be with us this morning lord i open your word to our hearts lord jesus and help us lord just that this next year that we'll just grow in grace and knowledge even more lord that you'll just be with us and make yourself manifest and known to us lord we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen now um last time we were talking about how joshua and ephesians compare one to another because they're both talking about the the placing the placing of of christians how you come you you're filled with the holy ghost and joshua types of the believer that's crossed over the river jordan and they're led by the holy ghost and to be placed into their inheritance so i um you can kind of as you read the book of ephesians you can see in there that paul is talking about a journey of a believer that begins when you are filled with a holy ghost and a lot of people um when you talk to people they i i feel like a lot of people mis miss that when you get the baptism of the holy ghost when you're born again that there's more to come that you're growing and grace and knowledge you don't automatically have every you know you haven't already defeated all of the anakins all of the amalekites all the gergeshots all of the uh the the uh problems in the flesh that were tied right there in joshua so i wanted this morning to read in luke chapter 2 verse 52. just kind of start off and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man that's kind of a strange that's a maybe a hard thing to wrap our minds around that jesus increased increase in wisdom and stature now take it all the way back to when he was a little baby as a little baby he didn't he had no understanding his little baby of what he was sent for and maybe take it a year forward maybe he maybe still just a one-year-old year old little baby running around and in a diaper or whatever they did back there had no understanding as he as each year grew by went by you know then god will begin to speak to him and he'll begin to understand more and more about what his purpose was so even jesus uh the fullness of the godhead bodily that all of these scriptures wrapped up and bottled up like brother brown said bottled up into one man grew in grace and knowledge in wisdom and stature and that's what we're talking about we're growing into the stature into his stature the statue of a perfect man because the only perfect man is christ jesus we're growing up into the statue of a perfect man that where he can be made manifest in us and in favor with god a man and look what he was doing before right before the scripture was uh we read this scripture about what he was doing just before that was he was sitting in the temple and under solomon's porch probably or wherever and uh listening to the to the priests you know speak about the the word the scribes and the pharisees and the ones they were teaching and that's how we grow a lot of times we uh you know we hinder our growth because we don't we don't put enough time into the father's business like what jesus he said i must be about my father's business the father's business is to in our life i believe is to study and read and pray and dedicate our life and you know over in in uh ephesians paul talked about how we are now in heavenly places when those heavenly places are the sphere a higher sphere of lifting ourself up and by devoting our life to god by uh you know making time to pray and read and and study lifting ourselves up into a higher realm where god can fellowship with us and heavenly the heavenly place that paul talked about in ephesians the parallels the canaan land that joshua uh the which types the holy holy oath led the children of israel into that uh everything everywhere they looked they could it was their inheritance their possession and these heavenly places the things that are in these heavenly places uh god in this pace excuse me patience temperance knowledge and and not just in the statute of a perfect man but healing for our body and and uh the walk of a christian life uh mortifying the flesh as paul said all of these things are are in part of the heavenly place and um so last time we were talking about how um how what what god did on the cross with this the brass serpent remember we talked about how the fiery serpents came out and and that he uh fired serpents from biting people and moses typed in in the old testament that he lifted up that brass serpent which types what christ did on the cross by becoming judgment being judged for us so that we wouldn't have to face judgment for we wouldn't have to um he did what we could not do by taking on all of our sin every everything that had been held account put to our charge in the garden of eden and uh just the sand and and so forth and then we looked at how the story of arthur neal and axa which was uh you know josh will let the children of israel over into canaan's land and and he told every joshua types the holy ghost putting everyone into their inheritance and he told each one where their part of the inheritance was and he put caleb in in hebron and and then he caleb gay uh he told uh austin neal if you'll go take this city cage's safer courageous safer than uh the city of the book then you can have this wife and and that times christ going and taking dying for our sins and taking the book to win back a wife and you know brother brown talked about how um when he when when when christ died on the cross remember we're talking about joshua and ephesians typing the believer claiming their inheritance or that or because god gave it to you on the cross there it is and joshua they they crossed over the river door and there it was laid before them all their inheritance they just had to go to go claim it to go i believe it god has given it to me and that's what i believe we're doing as we journey of the statute for of a perfect man as uh i was talking to the stat about the statue of perfect man to somebody and they they said uh well it sounds like what you're saying is is that you're talking about works that you've got to you like pressures like try to do something all the way up the statue of perfect man but you know what in in canaan's land they weren't uh who fought the battle you know uh i was listening to brother brown talk about how when they when they uh began to fight their battles and and just you know the first when they can uh took the babylonian garment of gold he just a few it was just a handful of people that died but joshua fell on his face and and uh something's wrong because we're not fighting the battle god is fighting battle if anybody dies at all something's wrong because this you know we they were carrying the swords and they were running in into battle with their shields but it was god that was fighting the battle that was all down through the old testament to get in and uh you know all the different things that happened to the old testament warriors of faith like a samson that could kill a thousand philistines with an old uh soggy jawbone you know just that was half rotted that's that was a samson doing that that was a almighty god the power of god being manifest in his life that's not that we're we're fighting this battle to destroy the amalekites in our flesh but it's god doing work in us we have to allow him to do that by mortifying our flesh as paul said letting ourself laying our life down so that he can work out his uh his fulfill his word in us and um bill abraham talked about how this inheritance is when he died on the cross he didn't he didn't leave an inheritance it was always written in him before the foundation of the world not uh sometimes when we think about an inheritance that we think about earthly possessions that when somebody dies they're going to leave you stuff and but this maybe look at a little bit different when christ because in him was written all of these attributes all these qualities about himself that had to be made manifest and you know broadband talked about in genesis that there was all these attributes that he wanted to fellowship with and so out of him came a little part of himself designated so that he could fellowship with you know a part of him called a you know genesis 1 26 27 and he began to make himself manifest and and so that he could god and his family and all these attributes be being made manifest love joy peace long suffering temperance goodness meekness and all of these things that himself are our inheritance and if you can't make him manifest and now he's making them made manifest in us and we looked at in the that old testament story of arthur neal and axa how axa her name is the unveiling the unveiling of god and god is unveiling himself and his people today and so um brother graham also talked about it and we'll look in a second we'll kind of start going through ephesians let's see how some of these types play out in ephesians but your inheritance is israel graham said your inheritance is weighty in the city of jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high because your inheritance begins with the new birth and you know we were listening to the token this morning driving to church and and brother brown just kept he spent so much time talking about having the old testament they when they offered that old testament sacrifice there was that life there was an animal doesn't have a soul there's no there's no way for that life to come back on a believer and make them live the way that they should but now with that with this perfect sacrifice that brass serpent that was offered up for us that life can come back and live in the believer and that all wrapped up in that when he when he when that token comes and lives inside of you then wrapped up in there is the attributes that could be made manifest and you your inheritance that land of canaan that the believers were taking taking over by faith now remember uh uh they didn't get that inheritance just because god gave it to moses they didn't get any inheritance because god gave it to to uh joshua they got it because he had promised it to abraham how many hundreds of years before by faith by grace through faith and that's how we get the inheritance in him is by it's by faith by his grace to us by our believing it and they they believe that promise that had been promised to abraham and that's how they were able to take over now what if um uh oh what if uh you know that god had promised that promise to abraham and he and that promise had journeyed now that they they you know they all had that confession we serve the god of abraham isaac and jacob because that's the god that they knew had made these promises to them and they were they were in that nation of israel that served that that one true living god and they when they crossed over jordan they knew that that the god that promised to abraham that that this land was theirs was was able to fight their battles and so uh what if and when he told caleb to go take this hebron from the giants what if caleb said well i just can't do it you know you know that that story already played out when they got the cash barnette when uh most of the spies said well we can't do it but caleb he went over he'd already seen canaan and he said i i know they're disabled i know my god is able to to do it and you know look at this uh stature i'm kind of uh moving into tying into kind of brother wade's territory a little bit but the statue of a perfect man is is that that canaan's land that i know god is able to to deliver it and to fulfill it in my life to give it to me that even though there's giants then in in canaan there were seven different uh the gergis shines the malachites the all the different seven different foreign tribes and each one was far more powerful than any of them there was no way that they could take the land just by their buy their own uh you know their own carnal taking up the sword and swinging it and there's no way that we could take there's no way that in myself that i could be godly or patient or uh temperate but by the token by that new birth then it it he made it possible so um we got about 15 minutes let me uh let's turn over to ephesians and we'll just kind of i thought i'd have a little bit more time i got a little bit wordy i'm sorry ephesians i'm going to skip around a little bit so we'll start a hebrew ephesians 1 and just kind of go through the whole the whole book um maybe quickly um so look look who this this this book is being written to now the little church's emphasis was started by paul and apollos and and cool and priscilla and paul stayed there three months when he's when he started the church when he left and then the next year the beginning of the next year he came back and spent three years there i believe it's three years and so that this you know brother i'm talking about this was just a little group of people but they were strong they were fortified they they were like the children of israel that crossed the jordan river that had been come to a place where they knew the god that they served they had knowledge that he was the same yesterday today and forever and they knew that he was more than able to fight their battles and that's that's the kind of people that paul was writing this book to paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you in peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ and heavenly places now now that's what i'm talking about it paul says he uses the phrase heavenly or heavenly places five times in his book but he's because he's typing that he's drawing on that that canaan land experience that they have crossed over jordan into heavenly places and now they have set before with them all the the inheritance that god has laid out before them and all they have to do is like like that table that brother i'm talking about all the you know if you need healing just reach out and grab it and claim it and say lord i this is what you have promised and if there's any aikens in my life let me destroy them let me lay them down on the altar of your sacrifice and let and and you just take it out of my life so that all of your promises can be made manifest because he promised it if if he promised it and something is not being fulfilled and there's something wrong there's something wrong somewhere because he promised it now now that's how they looked at in the old testament and i believe that's how we've got to look at it too according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will predestinated us into the adoption because in in the old canaan land they were predestinated they were called out chosen people predestinated you remember last time we were talking about how the um the their mamas had prophesied as they gave she gave birth where they were gonna where they were gonna be placed in that land and uh hundreds of years later joshua by the spirit of the lord put them exactly according to that prophecy because it was predestinated god had put them had an ordinary place for them to to be placed and and that's how the believer is in christ god will and remember this book of ephesians places the church he talks about husbands and wives and how masters are supposed to treat servants and how of apostles and prophets and teachers and how everybody in the church is supposed to treat one another and your place and and he puts everybody the spirit of god is putting everybody in place just like in the old testament with joshua in whom we also have it let's see where am i going i'm going to skip around a second all right let's get down to verse 10. so that i i believe you can read in ephesians paul begins to talk about building a body building a church and he you know brother branham used any preacher statue of a perfect man he used scripture from ephesians because paul is talking about once you are born again then you begin to grow in grace and knowledge just like jesus growing grace because he's he's building something he's building a church down through seven church ages he was building a church and in your own personal life he's building you up in the stature of a perfect man of the image of christ and when that building is completed let me find that quote when the building is completed there it is statue of a perfect man paragraph 451 add to your faith virtue add your virtue knowledge to your knowledge temperance to your tempers patience to your patients godless to your godless brotherly love to your brother love the holy spirit and christ will come christ will come when the building is completed oh man there's so many that you know the coming of the lord is the revealing of his word he's uh well i'm gonna get off but um so let's so we were looking at uh verse 10 chapter one verse ten that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together and one all things in christ both which are in heaven heaven and which are on earth even in him and whom also we have obtained an inheritance we've obtained it in him by being part of him being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first first trusted in christ and whom he also trusted after that he heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom after that he believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promised which is the earnest of our inheritance now crossing the river is the earnest and i keep stressing that because i that that's a difficult thing to realize that there's more to come after you receive the holy ghost lay yourself down on the altar of god's sacrifice so that god can can give you your full inheritance and full redemption full inheritance is the body change and that's what we're working for full inheritance full redemption which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession under the praise of his glory ah let's go to ephesians chapter 2 verse 1. and you have to quicken who are dead and trespasses and sins i keep stressing this because he's talking to a people he's talking about a road and a journey and building and all these different things building up a body because and here he's talk the people that he's talking to are the ones that are quickened they have been quick and they've been filled the holy ghost now this is the scriptural proof to in the statute of perfect man how i've got a list of quotes i was going to read about how the the statue of a perfect man is a requirement is something that is part of god requires and it begins at the new birth the foundation and this is this is the scriptural proof for that you have to quicken who were dead in trespasses and sins and uh and and go down to verse six and have raised us up together and made us sit together there's heavenly places again in heavenly places you're in canaan's fair and happy land that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through christ jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith that's how they got canaan's land because abraham had promised it uh god had promised it to abraham and abraham believed it by faith that everywhere you defeat your feet walk this land is giving you everywhere you can see this is your this is your inheritance for by grace are ye saved through faith is that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not a works because they all they could do was put take up that jawbone of an ass or their spear or their their sword and and just trust the lord that he would put it where it was supposed to go not of works unless any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus and the good works which god has before ordained that we should walk in them let me see what else i had let's go to chapter 2 verse 20. now here he starts talking about the building let's start at 19. now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone and whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the lord in whom ye also are building see now there's there's the the whole church the whole building down through seven church ages is building a big building with every all the believers and then inside of that individually the believers are growing into a statue of a perfect man in whom we also are building together for inhabitation of god through the spirit the church and the individual for what purpose let's go down to verse chapter 3 verse 9. to make all men see what is the fellowship of this mystery now remember what the purpose of those believers going into canaan's land when they crossed over jordan river remember they were looking out across the uh from jericho and they were began to tremble that was rahab's testimony that everybody would tremble when they saw you the pillar of fire leaving you and you come across the water just parks and here you come so they were a testimony to make all men see was the fellowship of the mystery to make everyone to when they looked upon them and saw the power of living god and they manifested the people then they uh it it was a revelation to the nations that god was alive that he's still alive and well i think he's alive and his people and that's it's just beautiful how these two compare one one to another and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world have been hidden god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god now that believers are in heavenly places there's heavenly places again making known to the world by you know god revealing himself and in the of a perfect man to his people now let's let's compare uh that scripture to the to the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known compare that let's jump over to chapter 6 verse 12. for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual weakness in high places and i'm going to finish on that because i'm about to run out of time now now in the old now this this is just so beautiful he's talking about in the old testament they they fought their battles with us with a sword they picked up a sword and they cut down you know we talked about those three giants that you know typed that the the trinity and how caleb and often went through there and just slew slowed down because they were restoring into that land the belief in just one god and and so they wrestled with with giants so they could see uh big old huge guys but now we wrestle on our knees down on our knees but asking god to help us and and you know you when you begin to pray for somebody that's lost or you your kids or whatever then that's fighting something that's maybe even a greater fight than was fought in the old testament so now let's let's just read on down for we and remember we're talking about building and fighting and overcoming taking your inheritance in the old testament joshua they fought with the knife now look how we fight when we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having you will learn loans gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fire and darks of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto you with all perseverance and supplication for all saints now all these pieces of the armor of the full armor of god are you know girl about with truth you gotta study a little bit you gotta read take some time and read a little bit before you even know how have an inkling of what truth is shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace be ready to give an account for what you believe above all taking the shield of faith and all these things is not so that you can fight but so that he can fight for you and so you can believe and trust him so let's just stop
