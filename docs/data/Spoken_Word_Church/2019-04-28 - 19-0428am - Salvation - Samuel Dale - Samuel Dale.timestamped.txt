[14:32] everything to you in Jesus name Amen
[14:38] Ephesians 2 we'll begin reading about
[14:44] verse 5 through 9 even when we were dead
[14:50] in sins hath quickened now this is
[14:54] coming down from the children of
[14:56] disobedience and the children of
[14:58] obedience and all that even when we were
[15:00] dead in sins hath quickened us together
[15:03] with Christ by grace you're saved all
[15:08] right now by grace you are saved now
[15:14] watch him as he continues his thought
[15:17] and has raised us up together and made
[15:21] us sit together in heavenly places in
[15:24] Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he
[15:29] might show the exceeding riches of His
[15:31] grace in his kindness toward us through
[15:35] Christ Jesus for by grace are you saved
[15:40] through faith
[15:43] now he's added something to his thought
[15:46] right first he said you're saved by
[15:49] grace through faith I mean by grace then
[15:53] now he says through faith all right and
[15:55] that not of yourselves it is the gift of
[15:58] God not of works lest any man should
[16:00] boast
[16:01] you may be seated the Lord at his
[16:03] blessing to the reading of the word then
[16:07] we're gonna take a little call
[16:09] maybe deal with it for a few services I
[16:12] don't know exactly how many they can go
[16:14] ahead and title it just put the title to
[16:19] it I gave them my regular title but just
[16:22] put the title to it we'll just call it
[16:24] salvation we're gonna talk about
[16:26] salvation all right because that can
[16:29] cover a lot of good things and you know
[16:32] so we're gonna be dealing but what we're
[16:34] going to be talking about today is
[16:36] you're saved by grace through faith all
[16:41] right
[16:42] saved by grace through faith well I'm
[16:46] just saved by faith well that's good you
[16:49] know if your points right you got
[16:52] something but I like the way this Chris
[16:55] was like I said he he says there that
[16:57] you're you're you're saved by faith by
[17:01] grace you're saved all right
[17:05] then he says through faith now grace is
[17:11] the merit unmerited favor of God given
[17:14] to mankind so we know for sure t what
[17:18] it's speaking of okay see salvation
[17:21] grace you know it's on the basis of
[17:26] God's unmerited favor it's not something
[17:29] that you and I could in any way merit if
[17:34] it would it wouldn't be called grace all
[17:37] right so now you say well it's just it's
[17:41] you know you can get to your point of
[17:44] where your mind and you'll be dealing
[17:46] here so well it's just by faith but I
[17:50] like the way Paul declares in C it's my
[17:54] faith yes my revelation that's what
[17:57] we'll get to talk about okay but he says
[18:01] it's by grace are you saved through
[18:04] faith all right now salvation is of the
[18:10] Lord it's not your point my point our
[18:14] goodness or anything we can't do
[18:16] anything to merit salvation there's
[18:21] nothing we can do you go we'll we'll
[18:23] Road there I've been good all my life I
[18:25] have never done is there that's good
[18:27] that's commendable you make a good
[18:29] neighbor Alcoholics Anonymous would like
[18:32] to have you on their side but that's
[18:35] just about the best you can do out of it
[18:37] because you can't say well well I'm I'm
[18:40] saved because I didn't do this or I
[18:42] didn't do that
[18:44] now that would put it on some kind of
[18:46] works all right
[18:49] see that wouldn't be what it would be
[18:51] it's by grace are you saved through
[18:54] faith
[18:56] all right through is a journey in your
[18:59] faith that will bring that to us
[19:02] the a traveler journey because I've
[19:05] always told you I believe it we we talk
[19:08] about salvation but to me you know
[19:12] there's a lot to be done with salvation
[19:15] a lot to be said about it and I'm a firm
[19:19] believer in ever since I heard the
[19:22] prophets message and begin to understand
[19:25] a little bit of what he was talking
[19:26] about then I'm I'm a firm believer that
[19:30] we you know salvation is just not a fact
[19:36] you walking up shaking somebody's hand
[19:40] it's not just something you could do
[19:43] neither is it something you can qu could
[19:47] quote memorize or do anything like that
[19:50] right it's not on that basis it's a
[19:55] journey that you're taking alright we
[19:59] talked about see after we come into
[20:01] message begin to understand because
[20:03] we've come through bad dissin and I
[20:05] doubt if a lot of you Pentecostals even
[20:07] thought much about justification
[20:11] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[20:13] ghost until you heard of the prophet or
[20:15] heard him express it you were more or
[20:17] less in - I'm saved we've got tears we
[20:20] got that we're in the gift we got it I
[20:22] know I'm saved because I do this I don't
[20:24] do that it's always been based salvation
[20:28] is mankind bases that upon what you can
[20:34] do or don't do or because of something
[20:36] you didn't do or you did you the the
[20:40] thing has always been to her that is try
[20:42] to put something that we could how
[20:44] something to do with it all right but
[20:49] the Bible said it's a gift of God now if
[20:53] it's a gift then you don't merit you
[20:57] don't do anything to merit that gift if
[20:59] you do it's not a gift me I mean you
[21:03] come to my house and you you work for me
[21:05] and I give you I pay you that's paid
[21:08] because you work for it you've done
[21:10] something but for me just to walk up to
[21:13] you and say here I want to give you this
[21:15] mean now you're dealing with no things
[21:19] whatsoever and that's what I want to
[21:20] thought in our mind this morning to lay
[21:23] the foundation to where we can just keep
[21:26] thinking on these things that there's
[21:28] nothing we can do nothing whatsoever you
[21:34] said well there's only one thing you can
[21:36] do and that's belief the only thing you
[21:39] can do is accept Jesus Christ as your
[21:42] Savior all right
[21:44] but now the Prophet said like this what
[21:47] you accepted him but has he accepted you
[21:53] well you know we come to Baptists and we
[21:56] know when brother Branham was explaining
[21:58] that about you know the the Baptist man
[22:00] said to him said well all Abraham could
[22:02] do was believe you mean what else is
[22:07] there to it other than believing that's
[22:09] good but now what has God done Lee we'll
[22:14] get back to Abraham maybe in his doing
[22:17] Abraham went through it the journey of
[22:20] things that would type justification
[22:23] sanctification
[22:24] and the baptism of the holy ghost he
[22:28] went through that so he had a journey
[22:31] Christianity is a journey salvation
[22:34] faith new birth whatever you wanna call
[22:37] it it's a journey
[22:39] it's not something you just walk up and
[22:41] there it is you know no it's a journey
[22:46] that you take okay ever born-again
[22:50] believer has to take that same journey
[22:54] no no no no no I I didn't do like that
[22:58] nothing you didn't do
[22:59] leap now you're putting it on something
[23:01] you thinking about salvation is based
[23:06] purely upon the grace of God faith is
[23:11] the journey through that that he
[23:16] supplies or does but it's a journey
[23:18] that's why I said it you say by grace
[23:22] all right through faith your journey
[23:31] that you take has to do with your faith
[23:33] or revelation our are dealing in your
[23:36] life well remember first off no and keep
[23:40] it at that that you're saved by grace
[23:44] grace is total unmerited favor all right
[23:49] see I can stand up here and say well I
[23:52] didn't drink I didn't do this I didn't
[23:55] do that I'm just as much a sinner as
[23:58] anybody else
[23:59] and so well I didn't do this brother
[24:02] dealer I didn't do that don't have
[24:03] anything to do with it you just just
[24:06] lost as anybody else is lost yeah but I
[24:10] didn't go out and do like other people I
[24:12] wasn't mean
[24:13] you know the problems are you'll think
[24:18] that you didn't do or did do and that
[24:23] made you where God would save you okay
[24:27] we're just talking
[24:29] me you say well I don't know no I
[24:33] believe I'm saved because I didn't never
[24:35] drink
[24:37] III didn't do this I didn't do that well
[24:42] now you're putting it on something you
[24:43] done so it's not of God me if there's
[24:50] anything that you and I could do then
[24:53] God died in vain that's what your
[24:55] prophet said all right now see if he
[24:59] died in vain then don't worry about it
[25:02] we just leave it at that
[25:04] see and believe that he did do it you
[25:10] say yeah but I didn't drink I didn't
[25:12] smoke I didn't you I didn't wonderful
[25:17] does that mean yours already saved
[25:20] oh no we're getting up no we get into
[25:23] all kind of things with it I'm just
[25:25] talking simple language to where the
[25:28] children can understand where we can all
[25:31] understand salvation you don't want me
[25:36] to be good brother Dale no I want you to
[25:40] get born again I don't take care of that
[25:44] we're a part of being good or not being
[25:46] good now being good is commendable
[25:49] children you ought to be good you ought
[25:51] to honor your parents you ought to honor
[25:54] this everything you're to be all of that
[25:56] right wonderful we agree with all of
[25:58] that and you're expected to do that but
[26:04] that won't save you so you've got to
[26:08] have your own experience of salvation
[26:14] it's not what Mama and Daddy believes
[26:17] it's not what they've done or didn't do
[26:19] or whatever you got to have that
[26:22] experience yourself and see then if when
[26:30] you putting it on the basis of that
[26:32] you're dealing then with why that it
[26:34] says it you're saved by grace no we're
[26:37] gonna drive this hard so you listen to
[26:40] it you saved by grace you're not just
[26:42] saved by faith
[26:43] and when we read the Prophet said you're
[26:45] saved by faith
[26:46] don't misunderstand what I just said you
[26:50] said what I I've got this revelation of
[26:52] the message so that means I'm safe now
[26:55] you're trying to do it in some other
[26:56] reason you're trying to put something up
[27:00] there
[27:00] that you don't need Dyer approached it
[27:04] the way I'm talking about it because
[27:07] that's what I believe
[27:08] grace is unmerited favor all right now
[27:15] nothing I could do or didn't do none of
[27:20] that would bring it to the basis of
[27:22] saving me the biggest problem is now I'm
[27:27] just serious about this matter it's to
[27:31] those that didn't do or this out of the
[27:35] other and you have any thoughts
[27:37] whatsoever about that being any form of
[27:40] your salvation just remember that's
[27:43] what's getting in your way remember
[27:49] those that are sin the most are the most
[27:53] out to ask for salvation I'm not
[27:56] justifying sin I'm not saying you need
[27:59] to go out and live like the devil now
[28:01] don't worry about it you are okay it
[28:06] doesn't matter if you try to be as good
[28:08] as you can and never do nothing wrong
[28:09] arrest all you lot that's still trying
[28:12] to work for the devil that's trying to
[28:13] work out something but I've got a but
[28:17] but brother Dale see out it see and then
[28:20] you you you'll go one way or you go the
[28:23] other way you'll put it to the basis of
[28:26] trying to how something you done or
[28:28] didn't do all right then you put it over
[28:32] and something you're doing or believing
[28:34] or whatever and it won't work well I
[28:37] believe this message so I know I'm saved
[28:40] well then what did God have to do with
[28:51] are you following me
[28:54] see you're saved by grace unmerited
[28:59] favor totally nothing you can do to
[29:03] receive it other than accept it but you
[29:06] must accept it you've got to accept what
[29:11] Jesus Christ done for you and I all
[29:14] right now but a rental might run one
[29:18] quote in here where he said in these
[29:20] mortal bodies we live in you know in
[29:23] other words his emphasis was we're in
[29:26] these mortal bodies well don't worry
[29:28] about it we're all born in sin shapen in
[29:32] iniquity spouse my mother's wound and
[29:34] going forth the liar every one of us
[29:40] well I'll tell you what I don't believe
[29:43] like what he's saying within all right
[29:45] tell me how you believe it but get the
[29:50] point now that I'm trying to drive the
[29:52] thought in you're saved by faith through
[29:59] I mean by grace through faith nothing
[30:06] you can do whatsoever then you start a
[30:10] journey now brother Branham will explain
[30:17] that as long as you're believing God
[30:20] you're doing great
[30:22] that's right that's where your salvation
[30:26] will deal upon your confession but if
[30:29] you stop believing God what happens do
[30:34] you lose your salvation
[30:37] no you just lost the confession because
[30:41] you didn't have the salvation cuz if you
[30:43] had the salvation you contend no that's
[30:45] the point right by grace through faith
[30:50] okay the statue of perfect man you start
[30:58] a journey and you keep going up through
[31:00] we teach that and we believe that but
[31:03] just remember your journey doesn't stop
[31:06] just at faith on the basis of the statue
[31:11] of a perfect man we look at it worse
[31:14] than uber that faith we have a journey
[31:17] before we get to the new work that we
[31:19] have to go through well I just believe
[31:25] it I just accepted it well now if your
[31:32] prophet is correct they will get later
[31:36] on to these but the future home he said
[31:40] I talked to reprocesses from the
[31:43] beginning he said from a boy and he said
[31:47] they hadn't changed one time well I've
[31:51] got work that definitely did I only said
[31:53] yes over here which said now are you
[31:55] going to talk to him
[31:57] don't talk to me go talk to him
[32:01] well that's impossible that's what I'm
[32:03] telling you so your thoughts are
[32:06] displaying what we are that makes us
[32:08] unbelievers he said I talked to
[32:11] reprocess is what justification
[32:13] sanctification the baptism in the Holy
[32:16] Ghost all right now see do we still
[32:23] teach it that way or do we just teach it
[32:26] as a believe the message well believe
[32:30] what we believe the Prophet well may I
[32:35] quote Paul have you received the Holy
[32:42] Ghost since you believe is that Paul did
[32:48] Paul make a statement have you received
[32:51] the new birth have you received
[32:53] salvation since you believe no God
[32:56] everything when I bleed now that's bad
[33:00] this doctrine all right so that puts you
[33:05] right where the Baptist is that you got
[33:08] it all when you believed it well I don't
[33:14] agree with that I didn't agree with it
[33:16] when I was in the badness
[33:19] all right
[33:21] the I could read the scriptures like
[33:23] being born again and all of that back
[33:26] there
[33:26] and it was a lot that that we could read
[33:29] and think about but the point listen a
[33:34] journey you as a when you started a
[33:40] journey in life as a baby right and
[33:46] you've been in that journey ever since
[33:48] no matter if you're 10 20 50 100 or
[33:52] whatever you are you've been in a
[33:55] journey we'll see why can't we think
[33:58] about that as a Christian journey that
[34:01] we've been in a journey and if you will
[34:05] think about it you can remember a lot
[34:07] about how that God contacted you or led
[34:12] you when you never even thought about it
[34:14] that you were going through a journey
[34:17] and never had any thoughts of what it
[34:19] was the people of the message has long
[34:25] forgot the fact that there's three it
[34:28] takes the justification sanctification
[34:30] the baptism and logos to make the new
[34:32] birth
[34:33] we just believe you accept the message
[34:37] that's the evidence that's know the
[34:43] prophet said the evidence is where the
[34:45] spirit Inu agrees with the word you know
[34:49] there's a lot of people out there right
[34:51] now you're going internet and run it up
[34:53] there's a lot I've been preaching 4050
[34:55] years
[34:58] well they taught it right to start with
[35:00] but where are they now but get what I'm
[35:05] down by see everybody is saved by grace
[35:10] there is no special thing for different
[35:14] points or our view are well well brother
[35:17] Dale I had this seed in me
[35:18] where was it put when was it put
[35:26] right we just ended the series and the
[35:30] last thoughts that we were talking about
[35:32] of the future home was what that I don't
[35:36] want to predestinate myself totally out
[35:40] of existence because if God ever would
[35:44] go back to self existing then I would be
[35:47] out of existence did you listen to that
[35:51] yes but I I've predestinated before the
[35:55] world I agree your prophet he said
[35:58] that's where the seed was put that's
[36:01] what he said you need to quote he said
[36:04] when was that seed put there he said
[36:05] before the foundation of the world when
[36:09] you were in his mind well I come with a
[36:14] seed in me a seed is we're in the spring
[36:22] of planting time here this part of the
[36:25] country and you know you've got to have
[36:28] a seed to be able to put in the ground
[36:33] you got a plant to seed acceptable but
[36:37] just because you talk about having a
[36:39] seed oh but I am a seed I know we can
[36:44] quote the Prophet we can go with it I
[36:46] believe what he says about it all right
[36:49] but he said that seed was put in you
[36:51] before the foundation of the world now
[36:54] where was it put I've only asked this or
[37:00] the two sold people because that's word
[37:02] all of those things originated back
[37:04] there in the seventies last one simple
[37:07] question you say I had a seed in me put
[37:13] it in your body was it in your spirit
[37:16] was it in your soul and this brother he
[37:21] said I'm not gonna answer that
[37:26] well go to feeder answered one time you
[37:31] know me if he said body I said well then
[37:35] you gotta agree your body was before the
[37:36] world
[37:39] if you say spirit you gotta greet your
[37:41] spirit was before the world if it is you
[37:45] say so then you gotta agree your soul
[37:47] was before the world because the Prophet
[37:48] said it was put in there before the
[37:50] world ever begun let's see we've lost
[37:56] the point of salvation I think and go
[37:59] into the great understanding of what we
[38:01] call revelation and then we say we're
[38:04] saved by revelation brother deal you got
[38:06] it laying right there in front of you
[38:07] gonna read it to it amen that's what
[38:09] your prophet said but does that
[38:12] annihilate when you say you're saved by
[38:15] revelation does that change the fact
[38:17] that you're saved by grace through a
[38:21] revelation a journey have you forgotten
[38:25] your Christian journey do you remember
[38:30] when you started your Christian journey
[38:31] you remember when you repented of your
[38:33] sins and you asked God to forgive you
[38:36] and you remember then as you the word
[38:39] began to unfold that you could see that
[38:42] you stopped doing things that you used
[38:44] to do and getting cleaned up and set
[38:48] aside let's see that ain't to finish
[38:54] through the journey you still gotta have
[38:56] the new birth alright what is the new
[39:03] burns brother branham it's the
[39:04] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[39:06] you what is the revelation personally
[39:10] you i'm just trying my best to tell you
[39:13] what it is my revelation of my new birth
[39:17] is exactly what I just read that I'm
[39:20] saved
[39:22] what by grace through faith if my
[39:33] experience ever comes to an end I'll
[39:37] know it was not genuine right acceptable
[39:44] in it I mean if this is any way that
[39:47] ever comes to an end then you didn't
[39:49] have what you're talking about
[39:52] all right see then it's a journey that
[39:58] we take a baby as I said I'm gonna go
[40:03] when it's born it starts their journey
[40:06] but the journeys not over because the
[40:09] baby's born right
[40:13] I just starts the journey all right so
[40:21] then your salvation starts the minute
[40:25] you believe amen we believe that it
[40:29] starts but that's not the end of the
[40:34] journey that's the starting of the
[40:35] journey see then you say well brother
[40:44] till all our God is based on this
[40:46] message
[40:47] that's all right that's fine with me I
[40:49] have no problem
[40:51] I'm just asking you a simple question
[40:55] what has that done to you if you've been
[41:01] in a Christian journey all in your life
[41:03] are you just well I just accept it by
[41:05] faith I got it all then where does all
[41:09] that work out to be wrong just making a
[41:15] little simple point this morning a
[41:17] simplicity to think about the Bible says
[41:23] that you can't come to God until God
[41:27] calls you that's Scripture huh you can't
[41:34] come to God till God calls you I
[41:38] accepted him huh I accept him but has he
[41:40] accepted you well all I could do is
[41:45] accept that's right but has he accepted
[41:48] you
[41:48] now the ain't accepted using there's
[41:50] something wrong with your accepting it's
[41:52] not wrong with him right I've heard
[41:56] people say you know there's one thing
[41:58] about it and boy their quota to God
[42:01] knows
[42:03] that I accepted him as my savior and
[42:06] it's up to him to save me that's a good
[42:12] point
[42:15] but what if we're following that wrong
[42:18] we were discussing a little bit out to
[42:21] our last night I mean I Wednesday night
[42:22] about your water baptism all right see
[42:31] the scripture says for you to repent and
[42:34] be baptized of the name of Jesus Christ
[42:36] for the remission of sins
[42:39] now what remits your sins the baptism
[42:47] come on what remix your sins
[42:50] is it your baptism yet I just read who
[42:53] repent everyone and be baptized in the
[42:55] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[42:57] of sins there's a lot of people that
[43:05] were baptized incorrectly as far as
[43:10] terminologies and use of words when
[43:12] brother Branham came along
[43:22] little random never started the doctrine
[43:24] of water baptism in the name of the Lord
[43:27] Jesus Christ it was already being used
[43:32] and then the question is like I was
[43:35] asking the brothers a simple question if
[43:37] somebody come in this church and I had a
[43:39] couple it did and said brother Dale we
[43:44] were baptized in the name of Jesus
[43:46] Christ
[43:47] you know the Bible if you ever read it
[43:53] does the Bible say to be baptized in the
[43:56] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[44:00] there is no scripture that says to be
[44:03] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[44:06] Christ you can find it I'd love to have
[44:09] it this it's not there it's to be
[44:15] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but
[44:26] what's how close it is is water baptism
[44:30] essential under salvation according to
[44:35] that scripture it is if they never want
[44:40] to be baptized in the name of Jesus
[44:41] Christ and you shall receive the gift of
[44:44] the Holy Ghost the promise isn't you
[44:46] now listen there is no promise in the
[44:50] Bible of receiving the Holy Ghost
[44:53] because you were baptized Father Son and
[44:57] Holy Ghost I'd like to read that it's
[45:02] not there there are no promise under
[45:06] Father Son and Holy Ghost
[45:07] that's the Trinitarian doctrine that was
[45:09] a change of the word the promise is to
[45:12] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[45:17] Racines are not remitted through Father
[45:19] Son and Holy Ghost what are you saying
[45:23] that that that the baptism is a sense of
[45:26] baptism is essential if you know the
[45:28] truth go that's what your scripture says
[45:30] scripture said it's an answer of a good
[45:32] conscience
[45:34] right we run to water discipline to
[45:38] baptize and all the cities unto a good
[45:41] conscience you have attained a lot of
[45:45] people let's receive the new birth that
[45:48] never got baptized in the name of Jesus
[45:49] Christ I agree but once truth is
[45:55] presented come on
[46:01] once truth is presented and you don't
[46:03] follow truth what happens there's one
[46:07] thing for sure if you have the new birth
[46:12] but genuine born-again experience you
[46:15] will come to the knowledge of the truth
[46:17] and if you don't come to the knowledge
[46:20] of the truth
[46:21] you're answering of a good conscience is
[46:23] running in the face you're standing
[46:27] looking at that because the answer of a
[46:28] good conscience if you won't do what the
[46:33] word says that's what I'm talking about
[46:35] simple little point of salvation in a
[46:37] few things this morning if you won't do
[46:39] what the word says does God have to
[46:45] accept you what I accepted him but has
[46:52] he accepted you well I would rather I
[46:59] accepted him what else gonna do Abraham
[47:03] accept me oh that's right but God gave
[47:07] Abraham a sign of circumcision to show
[47:12] he'd accepted his faith right and beside
[47:16] that Abraham went to journey the journey
[47:18] of life to go through the topping of
[47:20] justification sanctification baptism of
[47:23] the Holy Ghost he went through the
[47:25] example of that I said an example of it
[47:28] now listen see God accepted Abraham's
[47:35] believing
[47:41] if we refuse to do what the word says
[47:46] God does not have to accept our
[47:49] believing or let me put it this way God
[47:52] will not accept our believing thing
[47:55] we're proving there something wrong with
[47:58] our journey remember we can holler grace
[48:03] grace grace that's right but what about
[48:06] the journey you saved by grace through
[48:11] faith brother Brendan says you're saved
[48:17] a nun listen I'm quoting this one
[48:19] he said you're saved as long as you're
[48:22] confessing you're saved
[48:24] remember that we said when you stop
[48:27] confessing well you mean you truly be a
[48:33] born-again Holy Ghost field person and
[48:38] then lieu salvation no you can't but if
[48:45] you're just confessing on - you're just
[48:51] confessing on to your salvation you can
[48:54] lose that at any time all you got to do
[48:56] is lose your confession put them saying
[49:01] you have a grace that's good but what
[49:06] about the journey you followed
[49:15] a lot of the people of the message
[49:18] you're turning away from it now what
[49:20] their journey has come to a position of
[49:23] work that it's required some action or
[49:26] reaction by them and they've turned away
[49:29] from the word right is that God's fault
[49:35] but you know he's so great until all
[49:37] those years that's what I think about
[49:39] God you know you could serve God for 50
[49:43] years and die and go to hell and you
[49:46] know for 50 years God will deal we
[49:48] trying to get you to straighten up he'll
[49:54] do it then you can lose it will you
[49:58] believe you you believe in salvation
[50:00] that you can how salvation lose it if
[50:05] you're listening to what I'm expressing
[50:07] I'm talking about salvation salvation
[50:14] has a lot to do with that there's a lot
[50:17] of people that confess salvation that
[50:20] never get born again well I thought
[50:26] salvation was all I needed that is if
[50:30] you know what salvation really is all
[50:35] you need is a new birth well what do i
[50:37] do then to get the new birth believe on
[50:40] the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
[50:41] saved that's all you're gonna do call
[50:44] this all you can do but now God will
[50:48] come on and honor that in your journey
[50:52] you'll find out somewhere that you want
[50:55] to strike somewhere in your journey
[51:01] that's what is through faith grace is
[51:08] wonderful that's great but what about
[51:12] the journey that follows the grace well
[51:16] it don't matter what I do cuz I bought
[51:18] born again you know I've had people tell
[51:20] me you can't tell me I've died when I
[51:23] accepted him that's wonderful
[51:29] as the journey changed I asked a
[51:37] brother-in-law of mine one time we were
[51:39] discussing water baptism and we were
[51:43] talking about was it essential I said
[51:45] well the truth is essential you know I
[51:51] mean that's one thing we've got to lay
[51:53] on the truth is essential what I done is
[51:57] I brought him out into a situation to
[52:01] were that he had to make a decision
[52:03] himself go what I asked him was I said
[52:06] how long have you been ministering and
[52:09] baptizing people he's at home that time
[52:12] was 10 15 years or whatever it was I
[52:15] said you you baptize all them new
[52:18] converts in the name of the Father the
[52:20] Son and the Holy Ghost right I said wool
[52:27] now let me ask you a simple question see
[52:31] what I was trying to do was prove to him
[52:33] what his confession was wrong or his
[52:36] there's something wrong with it
[52:37] I said what about from now and I said
[52:40] you've told me we're sitting here
[52:41] talking you told me it don't make no
[52:44] difference never heard that one it don't
[52:47] make no difference
[52:48] God knows who I'm praying to or being so
[52:52] if I'm baptized Father Son and Holy
[52:54] Ghost it don't make no difference you're
[52:57] just too technical I said okay simple
[53:00] question you baptized 10 years father
[53:04] son Holy Ghost I said how about for the
[53:06] next 10 years baptized name the Lord
[53:08] Jesus Christ
[53:09] if it don't make no difference he said I
[53:17] can't do that cuz he he knew I was there
[53:20] I come through that Baptist I knew he
[53:23] couldn't go along with it because the if
[53:25] you'd baptized any other way than that
[53:27] that Baptists hold to that baptism hard
[53:30] boy you can go from a Methodist to a
[53:33] Baptist your don't matter if you've been
[53:35] baptized as a Catholic and a Methodist
[53:38] and the Presbyterian ten or fifteen
[53:40] times you go to Baptist Church
[53:41] don't get baptized again though they
[53:43] hold that as your essential when I said
[53:48] all right now do you understand what I'm
[53:49] saying so for now you just turn around
[53:51] start back it don't make no difference
[53:54] the brother Tom five boys asked his
[53:59] former I believe is Methodist pastor
[54:02] Andy well you know it's okay whatever
[54:05] you do he said all right said you've
[54:06] been baptized sign thinking eyes he said
[54:08] from now on baptized the name of Lord
[54:10] Jesus cry I can't do that I've got to go
[54:13] along with tradition in other words I
[54:16] gotta stay with my church now you
[54:19] understand what I'm saying I'm not
[54:20] throwing off on my brother-in-law but I
[54:22] need none of what I'm talking about I'm
[54:24] just telling the truth
[54:25] see he proved that God had not accepted
[54:29] his faith now we're gonna get to that
[54:35] just lay it down a little bit and let
[54:37] you think about it it's true faith now
[54:43] right everybody following me you saved
[54:47] by grace all that's correct through
[54:52] faith all right so you started Christian
[54:57] journey when you were formed as a baby
[55:00] believing on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[55:02] all that you started then it goes on if
[55:07] truth is presented to you why would you
[55:10] not follow truth well I don't think it
[55:15] makes no difference okay we got no
[55:19] problem ain't go first an argue with you
[55:22] I'm just gonna be there to witness the
[55:25] next baptism cuz I know what you gonna
[55:30] do then i'ma say it does make a
[55:35] difference don't it of course could do
[55:38] like I did with a man at work I talked
[55:40] to this brother at work and you know he
[55:45] saw it now he said the Lord spoke to it
[55:47] I ain't arguing with him he said Lord
[55:50] spoke to him and told him to get
[55:52] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[55:54] Christ
[55:55] verbally spoke to it I'm not joking I'm
[55:58] telling this is God's honest truth about
[56:01] it Russell okay now what you gonna do
[56:05] about it so he come in one day so they
[56:08] got that took care of said he got
[56:09] baptized name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[56:11] I said well great he said I won't call
[56:16] his name but he called him it was a
[56:18] preacher friend of mine he said he
[56:21] baptized me Saturday I said great he
[56:24] said baptize me both ways nothing cuz I
[56:31] knew what he'd done you know I said what
[56:35] do you mean he said we baptize in the
[56:38] name of the Lord Jesus Christ baptized
[56:40] and Father Son Holy Ghost
[56:41] that's before you say anymore now you
[56:44] don't say no more to me I said I believe
[56:48] you got baptized both ways yeah I said
[56:53] now I'm gonna tell you how yours
[56:54] baptized I said that brother baptized to
[57:00] you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:04] then he baptized you and Father Son and
[57:08] the Holy Ghost is that correct
[57:11] he said yes I said you erased your
[57:13] baptism I said if they depend of the
[57:16] basis you didn't understand and he had
[57:19] told you and you got baptized Father Son
[57:22] and Holy Ghost then got baptized Lord
[57:24] Jesus Christ you understand if you went
[57:28] thattaway it would have proved you were
[57:30] sincere and didn't know the difference
[57:32] but knowing the difference you've got
[57:35] baptized Lord Jesus Christ and erased it
[57:38] with father son Holy Ghost and this is
[57:40] his word he said don't you speak to me
[57:42] any more about these things he proved
[57:51] the point in his journey God had done
[57:58] the part of the grace right
[58:02] he had supplied the grace it's applied
[58:07] salvation in that
[58:09] race it even provided him with an
[58:16] opportunity to hear this message and
[58:20] even spoke to him now he said in an
[58:24] audible voice and told him to get
[58:28] baptized name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:30] although that was his confession but
[58:34] then when he wouldn't do it you
[58:40] understand what I'm saying
[58:41] God didn't accept him he accepted God
[58:46] right he accepted God and everything
[58:50] that he could do but God didn't accept
[58:52] him I'm not saying he's lost that's
[58:55] between him and God now come on you know
[58:57] way from that you just get what we're
[58:59] talking about yeah see the truth is
[59:05] essential under salvation well I didn't
[59:10] hear it I didn't know it
[59:11] God wings attack but now he said he
[59:16] commands all men to repent once the
[59:21] truth is brought see then you can say
[59:24] I've accepted him I accepted him I'd oh
[59:28] I was dark brother Dale I was burdened I
[59:31] went out and I believe he was calling me
[59:34] you know and I accepted him as my savior
[59:37] and that's the way they'll tell you you
[59:40] can't tell me I didn't do it either well
[59:43] now why are you trying to grow up about
[59:44] it I mean what are you trying to who you
[59:46] trying to convince right but has God
[59:56] accepted your confession to see you Lynn
[1:00:00] somewhere in your journey you'll come to
[1:00:02] a halt
[1:00:02] if you ain't made the correct start
[1:00:05] right there's like I told you about the
[1:00:11] the cups of brothers here that had told
[1:00:14] me that they were baptized in the name
[1:00:15] of Jesus Christ and said because I was
[1:00:19] in a little series talking about and
[1:00:21] they said do you think we ought to be
[1:00:22] bad
[1:00:23] again I said let me ask you this
[1:00:25] question that's because I know the Bible
[1:00:27] the Bible doesn't say the Lord Jesus
[1:00:29] Christ it says Jesus Christ
[1:00:35] now listen put it together like the
[1:00:40] Prophet did and he took Paul that says
[1:00:43] Lord right Paul said to baptize name of
[1:00:49] the Lord
[1:00:51] Peter said Jesus Christ put it together
[1:00:54] you got Lord Jesus Christ your prophet
[1:00:57] had it correct but there were people
[1:00:59] baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:01:01] Christ for brother Branham ever started
[1:01:08] there was a lot of people baptized in
[1:01:10] the name of Jesus Christ what did
[1:01:15] somebody come in and ask you you think
[1:01:19] me being baptized the name of Jesus
[1:01:20] Christ is okay what are you gonna say
[1:01:23] well no I don't think well where's your
[1:01:25] scripture what are you gonna tell them
[1:01:28] what's your scripture scripture says
[1:01:31] Jesus Christ what reason are you gonna
[1:01:38] say you're not going to accept him do
[1:01:43] this what I've done with those two
[1:01:44] brothers I said let me ask you this
[1:01:47] question and we'll solve the whole
[1:01:49] problem I said is it not true that they
[1:01:53] baptized you under regeneration because
[1:01:59] you see that's what the people were
[1:02:00] doing back there they were baptized in
[1:02:02] the mode of baptism everybody move damn
[1:02:04] Old River those words are they had it
[1:02:07] correct they had it Jesus Christ but
[1:02:12] they were doing it under regeneration
[1:02:19] come on
[1:02:23] I said then according to that if I was
[1:02:26] you I'd get somebody to baptize me again
[1:02:31] if I was baptized under a point of
[1:02:34] regeneration or a church teaching
[1:02:37] regeneration why do you think Church
[1:02:42] listen why do you think that church
[1:02:46] world was so against brother Branham and
[1:02:49] his water baptism come on you don't
[1:02:56] never think why were they so much
[1:02:59] against him when there was a lot of
[1:03:03] people baptized Jesus Christ our Lord
[1:03:05] Jesus Christ come on go study a history
[1:03:12] get some of these older ones that was
[1:03:14] back there in the Pentecostal move there
[1:03:21] was a lot of churches teaching water
[1:03:23] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:25] Christ our Jesus Christ before brother
[1:03:32] Branham ever come on the scene
[1:03:37] no I don't think that's right well good
[1:03:39] going to his print find out they go
[1:03:43] steady it a little bit find out forget
[1:03:48] what I'm saying why were they so much
[1:03:52] against him if they baptize in the name
[1:03:55] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:56] our Jesus Christ well there's so much
[1:03:58] against him in his baptism remember the
[1:04:03] three hundred ministers who come
[1:04:06] together were basically Pentecostal the
[1:04:11] Baptists and Methodists didn't go right
[1:04:15] they were Pentecostal preachers 300 of
[1:04:19] them and he said you've challenged me on
[1:04:23] my baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:25] Christ come on you're hurt you don't
[1:04:32] need never think things over sensibly
[1:04:34] out of that
[1:04:36] Shirley was a bunch of said well hey
[1:04:38] wait a minute discuss baptizing say my
[1:04:40] car would I baptized in the name of
[1:04:41] Jesus Christ he's baptizing languages
[1:04:43] finally brother Branham words say
[1:04:45] brother brother of repeats you more of
[1:04:47] baptism in jesus christ then he will
[1:04:50] lord jesus challenge it find it out
[1:04:53] study the message and see if brother
[1:04:55] Branham doesn't mention it's so much
[1:04:57] over and over he said they wouldn't
[1:04:59] baptize in the name of Jesus Christ you
[1:05:06] know why I done when I come into the
[1:05:09] message I heard him talk so much about
[1:05:12] cuz see I happen to know a little bit
[1:05:14] about the scriptures at that time not
[1:05:16] much but I understood a little bit and I
[1:05:21] knew the scripture said Jesus Christ not
[1:05:23] Lord Jesus Christ well you know what I
[1:05:28] was interested in all over other Dale
[1:05:31] you know yeah I was interesting one
[1:05:33] thing I wanted to find out who baptized
[1:05:37] brother Branham and I wanted to find out
[1:05:40] how he was baptized do you know the
[1:05:47] story of it do you know the story of it
[1:05:53] dr. Davis fight mistaken run baptized
[1:05:56] him but he baptized in the name of the
[1:05:58] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:59] he didn't just baptize him in name of
[1:06:01] Jesus Christ come on it took me a long
[1:06:06] time called we did not know computers
[1:06:09] but I found one day when he said said a
[1:06:13] man that baptized me in the name of the
[1:06:16] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:20] are you listening through your journey
[1:06:27] in or just do for people right over here
[1:06:30] if they came over and said we want to
[1:06:32] get baptized but what we want to do will
[1:06:34] to baptize our scripturally so once
[1:06:36] you're baptized us in the name of Jesus
[1:06:38] Christ would you do it no I wouldn't do
[1:06:41] it cuz it's gotta be large crop or you
[1:06:44] got your scripture
[1:06:48] they got description you ate that's the
[1:06:50] truth of it that could be further up the
[1:06:53] journey of Christianity or salvation
[1:06:55] then what you an hour and yet we're
[1:06:59] condemning them well brother Dale I
[1:07:08] think the Bible says it is baptized
[1:07:10] named Lord Jesus I'll find it
[1:07:11] well Krays God I like what brother
[1:07:13] George Canada said this this man he said
[1:07:15] something to him with him the man said
[1:07:18] well the Bible says so his own brothers
[1:07:20] your tone says well don't you go find it
[1:07:22] well I liked at least what the man said
[1:07:24] cousin brother George said he asked him
[1:07:26] later said did you ever find that he
[1:07:28] said no but I found a lot of other good
[1:07:29] things well at least we could find some
[1:07:32] good things you know but kill him saying
[1:07:38] here's a prophet he didn't change the
[1:07:42] scriptures come on he did not change the
[1:07:48] scripture that said Jesus Christ to Lord
[1:07:51] Jesus Christ and wants you to rewrite
[1:07:52] the Bible he done what jesus said jesus
[1:08:01] said to baptize in the name of the
[1:08:03] Father and of the Son and of the Holy
[1:08:05] Ghost
[1:08:08] Paul said baptized in the name of the
[1:08:11] Lord come on Peter said baptized in the
[1:08:18] name of Jesus Christ
[1:08:20] Peter said baptized in the name of
[1:08:23] Father Son and the Holy Ghost and to do
[1:08:29] that you baptize in the name of the Lord
[1:08:31] Jesus Christ
[1:08:32] that's why when I baptized somebody
[1:08:35] that's what I say to fulfill the
[1:08:38] Commission that the Lord Jesus said to
[1:08:40] baptize Father Son and Holy Ghost i
[1:08:42] baptize you my brother says in the name
[1:08:45] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:48] see Paul had to write with the Lord
[1:08:50] Peter had to write with Jesus Christ
[1:08:52] them together you got Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:57] do you know you ain't got none argue
[1:08:59] about
[1:09:01] but why did they argue with brother
[1:09:03] Branham when a lot of them was baptizing
[1:09:05] that away
[1:09:07] they knew what he was talking about he
[1:09:13] was dealing with their water baptism
[1:09:14] under regeneration and they didn't lock
[1:09:17] that he taught strictly against that
[1:09:21] right
[1:09:24] he taught against baptism in the name of
[1:09:27] the Lord Jesus Christ as a regeneration
[1:09:29] of phone you don't do that that's not
[1:09:33] what the scripture is saying when he
[1:09:36] said baptize in the name of the Lord
[1:09:38] Jesus right it means exactly what it
[1:09:40] says Father Son and Holy Ghost Lord
[1:09:44] Jesus Christ see now you got your
[1:09:48] scripture correctly see I'm still in the
[1:09:51] journey I haven't left the journey I can
[1:09:55] follow their journey of Lord Jesus
[1:09:57] Christ all the way through the Bible I
[1:10:01] haven't lost the journey I haven't lost
[1:10:04] the revelation well I don't understand
[1:10:10] because you know I mean we went to
[1:10:13] church now we've done this one don't
[1:10:14] shut Caprice your hand said I accept
[1:10:15] Jesus Christ amen
[1:10:20] that's great but what about the rest of
[1:10:24] the journey you just started your
[1:10:29] journey you telling me I'm saved cold I
[1:10:35] don't do this don't do that I didn't
[1:10:41] save you and I can't unsaved you but I
[1:10:45] like the way brother al said and we're
[1:10:47] gonna let him testify mr. second I liked
[1:10:50] what he said why don't you go up there
[1:10:51] Lula and let brother Dale talk you out
[1:10:53] of what you think you know something to
[1:10:56] that effect
[1:11:03] you see I believe it but I don't just
[1:11:06] put it all on grace you make it disgrace
[1:11:10] I thought we believed that our works was
[1:11:16] a display of the inward work of Christ
[1:11:20] in our hearts and salvation is that
[1:11:23] right
[1:11:26] our works out will listen to display
[1:11:29] what's within us as your journey stopped
[1:11:45] well brother Dale you shouldn't bring
[1:11:47] out things like you do cause it causes
[1:11:49] people to have problems problems if the
[1:11:53] word causes us to have problems we sure
[1:11:55] do need a lot of problem what I'm always
[1:12:02] open officer I'll be in they're going to
[1:12:05] get through coming let's say I'm talk
[1:12:07] about it I'm trying to get you to think
[1:12:13] about your your salvation and to be able
[1:12:17] to put together in your form of
[1:12:20] salvation all the things brother branham
[1:12:23] covers he said surely you're saved as
[1:12:29] long as your confession is correct do
[1:12:38] you need these quote but just remember
[1:12:44] the one thing our confession is great
[1:12:48] but has God accepted our faith the bible
[1:12:54] says abraham believed God and it was
[1:12:59] imputed unto him for righteousness
[1:13:01] what was imputed cause you was a great
[1:13:04] guy had nothing to do with him he
[1:13:09] believed God and it was imputed unto him
[1:13:12] what for believing God
[1:13:18] he believed God and God accepted it
[1:13:22] believing
[1:13:23] now listen Church he's got a better hope
[1:13:27] than any of us has got if you're gonna
[1:13:28] lay on your works and your ideas and
[1:13:30] thought because he didn't put it on
[1:13:33] though that he knew who who he was and
[1:13:34] what was going on but God accepted
[1:13:41] Abraham's believing as he accepted our
[1:13:47] believer when he accepted that ground
[1:13:49] believing he gave him circumcision as a
[1:13:52] sign of his believing correct
[1:13:55] what is circumcision the type of the
[1:13:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:02] right am i right now circumcision is a
[1:14:06] type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:11] have you received Paul said the Holy
[1:14:16] Ghost since you believed come on you've
[1:14:21] heard brother run say in the Bible later
[1:14:23] letter said it means literally saying
[1:14:24] since you previously believed there's
[1:14:27] something happened to you have you had a
[1:14:30] journey are you still in your journey
[1:14:40] but we're still travelling in a journey
[1:14:43] because what Abraham started with was
[1:14:46] what Abraham he ended with right Cohn
[1:14:54] did brother branham exclaims Genesis 12
[1:14:57] as justification Genesis 16 in
[1:15:00] sanctification on Genesis 17 going into
[1:15:03] the ninth as the baptism of the Holy
[1:15:05] Ghost going on into what we talked about
[1:15:07] as being adoption a change of name and
[1:15:11] things that's what blood around explains
[1:15:15] it can we say we followed that journey
[1:15:20] or are we just making about what I
[1:15:23] accepted him I've done all I can do now
[1:15:26] let me quote one to you on that basis
[1:15:29] you remember a little fella by the name
[1:15:31] of Cain now here's where brother Brennan
[1:15:40] said Cain said one day he said I've done
[1:15:44] all I'm going to do I'm paraphrasing
[1:15:48] that's very close he said I've done all
[1:15:51] I'm going to do I'm not going to do
[1:15:54] anything else that's pretty close it's
[1:15:58] close enough do you know the point
[1:16:02] in other words Cain said I've offered my
[1:16:06] sacrifice you wanted me to offer a
[1:16:08] sacrifice I've offered my sacrifice I've
[1:16:10] done this I've done that and I ain't
[1:16:13] gonna do nothing else
[1:16:21] who was it done was it buddy Robinson
[1:16:24] enough I'm quoting wrong with me but who
[1:16:27] was the one that said he's out in the
[1:16:28] cornfield he said now listen Lord said
[1:16:30] I'm gonna be right here and I'm
[1:16:32] accepting you and said if you don't
[1:16:34] accept me or don't give me salvation
[1:16:35] I'll be right here you'll find a pile of
[1:16:38] bones well that wouldn't him demand in
[1:16:42] God to come to him he had it right well
[1:16:48] it looked like he was saying God you
[1:16:49] know I'm betting oh he had it right he
[1:16:52] was putting it every bit up on God
[1:16:55] meeting him right there if we put it all
[1:16:57] on God meeting us in the word we don't
[1:17:01] have to worry about it okay
[1:17:06] choice of water baptism is it essential
[1:17:10] wise father son Holy Ghost not correct
[1:17:14] when it says Lord Jesus Christ Father
[1:17:17] Son and Holy Ghost you see why that your
[1:17:24] prophet was attacked by them not because
[1:17:27] of the wording he was using of Jesus
[1:17:31] Christ our Lord Jesus Christ because he
[1:17:34] knew their background was under
[1:17:38] regeneration other words if you say it
[1:17:44] like this if you say well I'll tell you
[1:17:45] what brother Branham baptized me
[1:17:48] wonderful I wish I'd had that
[1:17:51] opportunity that don't save you we went
[1:17:56] to Israel I've been baptized father son
[1:17:58] Holy Ghost when back same River down
[1:18:01] below right blood got baptized name the
[1:18:03] Lord Jesus Christ huh
[1:18:05] went to Israel out of 26 of us there was
[1:18:10] four people got baptized that was my
[1:18:14] wife and I and brother Dean given his
[1:18:15] wife sister Peggy rest of us said well
[1:18:18] we've been baptized will be back I said
[1:18:19] I don't care if I come back a dozen
[1:18:21] times I still want to get it if I went
[1:18:23] today I'd go to the Jordan River try to
[1:18:24] get me a good message believer to
[1:18:28] baptize me if I couldn't I'd grab me a
[1:18:31] good old Baptist and say I'm sure gonna
[1:18:32] listen to you now you make sure you say
[1:18:34] it right
[1:18:37] you say hey you're crazy
[1:18:39] I'm serious he didn't know now my water
[1:18:43] baptism to give back that I loved it
[1:18:46] because it's speaking of what I am me
[1:18:51] and the water baptism is not under
[1:18:55] regeneration but it's a promise now
[1:19:01] that's what I was saying while ago and
[1:19:02] I'll end on this stop there's no promise
[1:19:04] and Father Son and Holy Ghost cause you
[1:19:07] ain't even in the Bible right
[1:19:10] they don't promise and father-son hold
[1:19:12] ago you're not in the Bible the promise
[1:19:15] is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:19] if we're not willing to follow what the
[1:19:22] word says is God obligated to make our
[1:19:27] salvation to be worth anything so you
[1:19:37] can say all you want to to me about I
[1:19:38] accepted him but I just say what the
[1:19:41] Prophet said has he accepted you well I
[1:19:44] don't know about that now cuz ain't none
[1:19:46] of my business that's up to him what
[1:19:47] he's gonna do but I accepted him and he
[1:19:50] can't deny you know how to deny though
[1:20:02] like I said Cain said Lord I've done all
[1:20:08] I'm going to do you take it or leave it
[1:20:13] you know what God left it he just left
[1:20:20] it well well Cain accepted God you ain't
[1:20:26] never heard brother branham talk about
[1:20:27] though son that if you're doing it on
[1:20:29] the basis of sincerity in the came with
[1:20:31] justice since there can't work this
[1:20:33] after death raising those beans and
[1:20:37] taters and corn and everything to bring
[1:20:39] all that up there enable lazy shiftless
[1:20:43] bum laid up over a hill over take
[1:20:45] Kirsten she I don't mean that wrong
[1:20:49] meaning truth it looks like Cain had the
[1:20:53] grater offering so much until the
[1:20:57] scripture said that you know how does it
[1:21:00] saying that a more excellent sacrifice
[1:21:02] we had a brother here one time explain
[1:21:04] it in great length how that Cain's
[1:21:06] offering was excellent I said then
[1:21:11] you're testifying that works is first
[1:21:13] and salvation is second I said that's
[1:21:16] why I'm not agreeing with you that's
[1:21:21] what I'm telling us I'm not agreeing Lee
[1:21:23] those Cain's offering proves what he was
[1:21:28] works as a form of salvation Abel proved
[1:21:34] it was by faith our grace and listen the
[1:21:40] Bible says and your prophet said then it
[1:21:43] was revealed unto Abel right well what
[1:21:49] do you think Cain said don't you think
[1:21:55] Cain walked up before God said now God
[1:21:58] is revealed to me works I'm working
[1:22:06] myself to death for you lord what is it
[1:22:08] better than what I'm doing
[1:22:09] look what I will do it he let up her on
[1:22:11] the hill and he murdered a calf I mean a
[1:22:17] lamb and I wouldn't do nothing like that
[1:22:21] I've lived a good life which one God
[1:22:28] accept you accepted one of the two now
[1:22:32] you take it what you want to come back
[1:22:35] to that point you say I've accepted God
[1:22:37] but has God accepted you you know he
[1:22:42] knows why we do everything come on
