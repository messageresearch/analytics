[3:52] mike i don't think they've had service

[3:57] so
[3:58] the people need they need comfort they
[4:00] need they need they need to see their
[4:02] shepherd back
[4:03] amen
[4:04] all right now let's remember a couple
[4:06] more things november the 6th bible study
[4:08] we got november coming up
[4:10] november the 10th brother marcus becker
[4:12] will be with us november the 14th will
[4:15] be our church dinner we'll only have one
[4:17] service
[4:18] and then you know that the next weekend
[4:20] will be
[4:21] our next week will be thanksgiving and
[4:23] we will not have service on that
[4:25] wednesday night we will have service
[4:27] on that tuesday night all right that's
[4:30] been something we've done for several
[4:31] years so just keep that in your heart
[4:34] and your mind so all mine's clear
[4:36] you ready to hear the word of god
[4:39] you know i was thinking yesterday
[4:42] when i read that quote i'm gonna read it
[4:43] again where brother brown says he's
[4:44] coming in a different way
[4:47] we're gonna talk about a different way
[4:49] but now remember when i made that quote
[4:52] last
[4:54] weekend it maybe seems to stumble you a
[4:57] little bit because you say well we got
[4:58] to learn all this new way no remember
[5:01] jesus came exactly
[5:05] the way the old testament said he was
[5:07] coming he didn't miss it by one
[5:09] scripture
[5:11] right so he came what was in the bible
[5:13] but he didn't come the way they wanted
[5:15] him to come
[5:17] so it's not some new seventh seal
[5:19] revelation we're going to get a new
[5:21] bible we're going to get a new quote
[5:22] we're going to get a new this no it's
[5:24] the same thing that we've read all along
[5:27] it's just going to there's going to be
[5:28] more reveal there's going to be more
[5:30] opened up there's going to be more
[5:32] light and listen there's going to be
[5:34] more power in the word of god
[5:36] as brother bob was preaching on the
[5:38] other night you know we got the
[5:39] mechanics we got all the books and tapes
[5:41] we we listen to them all the time we
[5:42] read them all the time we read the
[5:44] quotes the dynamics is makes that thing
[5:46] go though
[5:47] all right so we got the mechanics and i
[5:49] believe we're heading to the dynamics
[5:51] and i think we got to understand that
[5:53] it's not something that we got to go
[5:54] find it's something you already got
[5:56] inside of you you just got to let that
[5:57] thing out
[5:58] let that thing do what it's supposed to
[6:00] do like ryan said
[6:04] one two three
[6:06] every time
[6:08] god told the king to do so and so and so
[6:10] and so as long as they did it
[6:12] as long as israel did exactly what he
[6:14] said
[6:15] god was blessing them abundantly the
[6:18] first time
[6:20] they turned against him the first time
[6:23] i mean look he told solomon he said
[6:25] solomon as long as you walk in my ways
[6:28] you'll be the wisest man on earth and he
[6:31] was the wisest man on earth until what
[6:33] he let two women bring another god in
[6:36] hello somebody
[6:38] a strange doctrine he let he let two
[6:42] women in
[6:43] and you know what that was his downfall
[6:44] he died right after that so god will
[6:47] bless you as long as you stay in his
[6:48] blessings
[6:49] but you get outside of his blessings
[6:51] then he doesn't have to bless you see if
[6:53] you stay under his blessing he has to
[6:55] bless you but if you get out from under
[6:57] his blessings he don't have to bless you
[6:59] so let's go to john 1 1
[7:01] continue this series
[7:03] but just keep those things in the heart
[7:04] we're just trying to make everything
[7:06] good right we want to have be a good
[7:07] example
[7:08] to everybody
[7:10] don't think people's watch not watching
[7:12] you
[7:13] watching every move you make
[7:15] all of us
[7:17] so we're supposed to walk right you know
[7:19] what they watched jesus
[7:21] they watched every move you made they
[7:22] called him a wine bibber they called him
[7:24] a uh you know somebody that
[7:26] was hung around prostitutes and sinners
[7:28] and didn't wash his hand when he eat
[7:32] right
[7:33] why do you not watch your your disciples
[7:36] not wash your hands
[7:38] boy sister rachel your mother have a
[7:40] problem with that one
[7:41] sister race was always talking about men
[7:42] don't ever wash their hands
[7:45] the disciples didn't
[7:48] and they ate
[7:49] they lived and survived
[7:51] so john 1
[7:53] verse 1 let's pray before we get started
[7:55] let's remember
[7:57] i cannot remember his name but they call
[7:59] him tata
[8:00] and that means grandfather in romanian
[8:03] i'm i'm pretty sure but let's remember
[8:05] tata while we're praying amen to

[9:23] these blessings in jesus name amen
[9:26] who is this son of man john 1 1.
[9:30] in the beginning was the word and the
[9:31] word was with god the word was god
[9:34] the same was in the beginning with god
[9:35] all things were made by him and without
[9:37] him was not anything made that was made
[9:40] in him was life and the life was the
[9:42] light of men
[9:43] and the light shineth in darkness and
[9:44] the darkness
[9:48] comprehended it not there was a man sent
[9:50] from god whose name was john we know
[9:52] that was john the baptist same came for
[9:53] a witness to bear witness of the light
[9:55] that all men through him might believe
[9:57] he was not that light
[9:59] the prophet of god was not that light
[10:01] all the prophets were not that light
[10:03] there's only one light the light
[10:05] the one that said let there be light
[10:08] amen but now we're here to declare him
[10:10] and the prophets are here to declare him
[10:12] right
[10:13] he was not that light but it was sent to
[10:15] bear witness of that light
[10:16] that was the true light which lighteth
[10:18] every man
[10:20] that cometh into the world he was in the
[10:22] world the world was made by him and the
[10:23] world knew him not he came exactly the
[10:25] way the bible said
[10:27] but he came a different way
[10:30] that's what brother brown said son of
[10:31] man we'll read it and he said this is
[10:33] all going to come a different way
[10:35] why it's going to come not out of the
[10:36] normalcy
[10:38] of religion
[10:39] amen
[10:41] and we'll talk about a body that has
[10:42] prepared me this afternoon
[10:44] but we're going to indict this
[10:45] generation today first you got to do
[10:47] that he came unto his own and his own
[10:49] received him not but as many as received
[10:51] him to them gave he power to become the
[10:53] sons of god that's me in you even to
[10:55] them that believes on his name which
[10:56] were born not of blood nor the will of
[10:58] the flesh nor the will of man but of god
[11:01] and that word same word was made flesh
[11:03] and dwelt among us
[11:05] and we beheld his glory the glory of the
[11:07] only begotten of the father full of
[11:08] grace and truth you may be seated in the
[11:10] lord and his blessing to the reading of
[11:11] the word
[11:12] and we'll just kind of review over a
[11:14] little bit today
[11:17] genesis 3 15 says i'll put enmity
[11:19] between thee and the woman and between
[11:21] thy seed and her seed showing that there
[11:23] had to be a natural
[11:25] happening
[11:26] man died in flesh
[11:30] adam and eve
[11:32] they had a fleshly experience
[11:34] amen it didn't kill their soul
[11:37] their soul was eternal their soul was
[11:39] part of that genesis 1 26 ma'am amen
[11:42] all right part of that genesis 1 26 man
[11:45] that soul was eternal
[11:47] couldn't fall
[11:49] listen you can't have god fall
[11:51] god can't fall
[11:53] all right so when he put that inside of
[11:55] adam adam couldn't fall in his soul
[11:59] he could fall in his flesh and in his
[12:01] spirit realm
[12:02] that's where you fall
[12:04] you fall in your spirit realm like i
[12:06] said last sunday you know you look
[12:08] cross-eyed at them if you want to but
[12:10] you don't when you sin out here in the
[12:12] world or do something wrong or or or get
[12:15] condemned that's not in your soul your
[12:17] soul is what's condemning you
[12:20] and if your soul don't condemn you you
[12:22] don't have one in there that will
[12:23] condemn you
[12:26] that's what i'm telling you about this
[12:27] adoption that we're coming to if we
[12:29] don't become more and more aware
[12:34] of what we're doing than not doing then
[12:36] we're not going up that statue of
[12:37] perfect man
[12:38] and you might be just a regular good old
[12:40] christian and that's okay but that's not
[12:41] what our requirement is
[12:43] the requirement of the son of man is to
[12:45] take a body change and you won't take a
[12:47] body change
[12:49] acting like we do me everybody else
[12:51] because we haven't come to that position
[12:52] yet
[12:53] i will put enmity between then the woman
[12:55] and between thy seed and her seed and
[12:56] that shall bruise my head thou shalt
[12:58] bruise his heel showing
[13:00] that the act of redemption has to come
[13:02] if they died in flesh that there's gonna
[13:04] have to be somebody come and bring flesh
[13:07] back
[13:08] become flesh and bring the flesh back up
[13:11] now we know
[13:14] here's adam
[13:15] soul was eternal
[13:17] spirit was given to him by god
[13:20] remember reason consciousness affects
[13:22] the imagination hello
[13:24] all right and then he was given a body
[13:25] in genesis 2 7.
[13:27] and inside of him was a special
[13:30] was a special thing because
[13:32] god wasn't going to create another
[13:34] person
[13:36] he was going to take that person
[13:39] and divide him
[13:42] male and female created he them so
[13:44] there's that part over here he can't
[13:46] change that
[13:47] but when he brought he brought adam
[13:49] first
[13:51] eve was inside of him then eve was taken
[13:54] out of adam and then the spirit of the
[13:57] feminist part of eve was put into her
[14:00] and there she was flesh out of
[14:02] who out of adam out of his side flesh of
[14:04] his flesh bone of his bone all right
[14:07] so now
[14:09] that's the same way now remember when
[14:11] they got separated god knew
[14:14] they were going to fall
[14:16] i was reading this morning in adoption
[14:18] series brother brown started in
[14:19] ephesians talking about foreign
[14:21] knowledge
[14:22] he said that's the reason the lamb had
[14:24] to be slain before the foundation of the
[14:26] world before everything came he knew
[14:28] they were going to fall so he didn't
[14:30] give satan one second of an opportunity
[14:36] to destroy his plan
[14:39] so if we look at the plan of god it is
[14:41] already already set signed and delivered
[14:44] satan can't do anything about it
[14:47] he can play all he wants to but god's
[14:49] already
[14:50] if your name's on the lounge book of
[14:51] life you're already sitting in heavenly
[14:53] places amen and you can't be lost
[14:58] praise god
[15:01] so adam was already saved
[15:04] before he got here
[15:06] in the mind of god
[15:08] as brother bob was talking about
[15:11] in the mind of god you're saved when you
[15:14] were born of your flesh mom and daddy
[15:16] you weren't
[15:18] because the bible said not of the will
[15:20] of the flesh not of the will of the of
[15:22] this body that's here but of what but of
[15:24] god we're born from above
[15:26] and truly
[15:28] if jesus
[15:30] could live in human flesh and be the
[15:32] be the absolute headstone
[15:35] and now he lives inside of me and you
[15:36] that's the whole point of this whole
[15:38] thing and he now transferred all that
[15:40] inside of you
[15:41] now not all of it he was the fullness of
[15:43] the godhead bodily but you get your part
[15:45] right but see there by foreign knowledge
[15:47] god knew what part you wanted
[15:51] and there is your journey
[15:53] there's the foreknowledge of god
[15:56] setting your destiny by what he saw that
[15:58] you wanted and didn't want
[16:00] amen
[16:01] so listen yes obviously
[16:04] god is all-knowing
[16:05] and he's already got this thing set
[16:08] but it's only set by the life he saw you
[16:11] live
[16:12] so you have a lot to do with this
[16:14] amen
[16:18] why are y'all so quiet this morning
[16:23] okay
[16:24] if the ball game you wouldn't be
[16:27] deuteronomy 18 15 says the lord thy god
[16:29] shall raise up to the
[16:31] unto thee a prophet from the midst of
[16:33] thee of thy brethren like unto me unto
[16:35] him he shall hearken so now this is
[16:37] another promise because we're going to
[16:39] go back and we're going to see jesus
[16:41] we're going to walk him through the old
[16:42] testament
[16:43] this afternoon but this morning we're
[16:45] going to kind of
[16:47] go back and get a background listen
[16:49] because i want you to understand why we
[16:52] need the revelation of the son of man
[16:54] listen if you've been in this message
[16:56] any time in your life
[16:58] you've heard of the son of man
[17:01] you've heard son of man son of man son
[17:03] of man this is the son of man message
[17:04] brother bradham talks about the son of
[17:06] man this son of man that jesus called
[17:09] himself the son of man so there must be
[17:11] something about this son of man
[17:13] amen
[17:14] and there must be something about him
[17:16] that a lot of people don't understand
[17:19] i'm talking about 99.9 of the people in
[17:22] the world do not understand who the son
[17:24] of man is
[17:29] they make him a second person of the
[17:30] trinity
[17:34] they don't baptize in his name
[17:37] the very salvation that he came to give
[17:41] so the whole part that's why brother
[17:43] branham had to come and restore
[17:46] the son of god revelation first because
[17:48] it got lost
[17:49] but then the son of man revelation is
[17:51] like he said it's something different
[17:55] jesus was a different individual
[18:00] yet he was human
[18:01] yet he ate every day
[18:03] yet he walked the road rose of galilee
[18:06] yet he talked to the people he healed
[18:08] the sick he raised the dead
[18:11] he did everything that he said he was
[18:12] going to do and they killed him for it
[18:16] that's what they killed him for
[18:18] they killed him for saying he was god
[18:21] they didn't kill him for all the other
[18:22] things they didn't hate brother branham
[18:24] while he was while he was on his road
[18:26] around in different communities and
[18:27] healing the sick and raising their dead
[18:31] the pastors loved him
[18:33] he was just filling churches full there
[18:35] was no message church back then
[18:38] remember he said you get saved he said
[18:40] go to find you some full gospel church
[18:43] or he said you go back and tell your
[18:45] people in your church
[18:47] see he didn't he couldn't there's
[18:48] nowhere he could send them
[18:50] but see that was under the son of god
[18:51] revelation like we were talking about
[18:52] last sunday
[18:54] because the son of god revelation got
[18:56] them saved
[18:57] got them saved sanctified filled with
[18:59] the holy ghost all right made him live a
[19:01] better life
[19:03] and we'll read that right here in just a
[19:04] second
[19:05] but now matthew 16 the word don't need
[19:07] to read that because jesus you know what
[19:09] he's saying jesus said who do men say
[19:12] that i the son of man am and they told
[19:13] him who the son of god was he said i'll
[19:15] build my church on that and the gates of
[19:17] hell will not prevail against it
[19:19] all right but now listen
[19:21] if you ever wonder why jesus sat that
[19:23] why he didn't rebuke peter
[19:26] because he didn't answer the question
[19:30] why didn't he say peter
[19:32] that's not what i asked you
[19:36] he didn't
[19:37] he just continued on said okay i'll
[19:39] build my church on that revelation
[19:42] because see being almighty god
[19:44] he knew
[19:46] that they were going to crucify him
[19:48] he knew that they were going to he was
[19:50] going to come back on the day of
[19:51] pentecost as the holy ghost but he also
[19:53] knew being the word
[19:55] he knew that there had to be a group of
[19:57] people way down the line 2 000 years
[19:59] later
[20:00] that was going to get that revelation
[20:02] again and him come back again
[20:05] and get into your human flesh and change
[20:08] your body
[20:09] amen i believe i believe that's what he
[20:11] was if he if he didn't know it
[20:13] you know there's some things that jesus
[20:15] didn't know
[20:16] brother brown said he didn't know
[20:17] anything about it when he was coming or
[20:18] about his second coming
[20:20] so
[20:21] and he said only the father knows that
[20:24] there's some strange things but remember
[20:26] jesus was ever human
[20:28] but he was ever with god
[20:30] amen and we got to see that you say how
[20:32] can we listen we ought to be able to see
[20:35] it more than the whole world sees it
[20:37] we ought to be able to see that
[20:39] and understand how can be ever wit human
[20:42] and ever with god because
[20:45] apart from your birth
[20:47] you came just like jesus did
[20:49] apart from your sex birth
[20:51] you understand what i mean he grew up
[20:52] like a kid he learned by the things he
[20:54] suffered he grew in grace and knowledge
[20:57] he came to a river jordan and he was
[21:00] approved or accepted of of god the holy
[21:03] ghost came down on him on the river
[21:05] jordan and said this is my beloved son
[21:07] and whom i'm pleased to dwell brother
[21:08] brown said that's the same thing happens
[21:09] to the believer
[21:11] then he walked through his christian
[21:12] journey
[21:14] he walked through his christian journey
[21:15] doing what the father said now look the
[21:17] only the only difference in him and me
[21:19] and you
[21:21] is he said i only do that which the
[21:24] father shows me
[21:25] we have a problem with that
[21:28] you don't do everything
[21:30] you don't even do everything your
[21:31] natural father says much less your
[21:33] spiritual father
[21:35] that's what i told my kids they wanted
[21:36] to be famous i said you want to be on
[21:38] oprah winfrey i said i'll promise you
[21:39] one thing do everything your parents
[21:41] tell you to do and you'll be on oprah
[21:42] winfrey because ain't a kid that's ever
[21:45] born since adam and eve had the kids in
[21:47] the garden of eden that's ever done
[21:49] exactly what their parents said because
[21:51] we thought they were dumb as a rock till
[21:53] we were about 30.
[21:55] amen
[21:57] then they smartened up just i mean boom
[21:58] they just got smart
[22:02] no
[22:02] well jesus didn't have a problem with
[22:04] that he knew who his father was
[22:06] amen
[22:08] so that's but see that's what we're if
[22:09] we don't have the mind of christ and
[22:11] it's supposed to change us
[22:13] because you know what if my natural
[22:14] father was not a christian
[22:16] and he was an alcoholic or he cursed
[22:18] like a sailor i don't want to have i
[22:20] don't want to be like that
[22:22] i want to be like my heavenly father
[22:24] all right so that's we got to see that
[22:26] there's there's a difference in us and
[22:28] jesus because he did only what the
[22:30] father said because the father was holy
[22:32] so he only did holy things
[22:35] he did run some people out of a temple
[22:37] one time got a little angry at him hmm
[22:40] yeah and planted a rope
[22:45] he plotted his plan
[22:48] by platting his rope
[22:50] cause it took a little while i bet he
[22:51] didn't make one about that big no he
[22:54] probably made one about that big of
[22:56] leather and he's sitting there in the
[22:57] corner of that temple and he's going all
[22:59] right
[23:00] i'm gonna start with that one right
[23:01] there cause that one's gonna hit the
[23:03] door first
[23:04] i'm gonna start that one's last because
[23:06] he's the one that's been beating them
[23:07] animals and then he tied that knot and
[23:09] he took off well you know what
[23:12] it's okay don't let the sun go down in
[23:14] your wrath though
[23:16] but he's our example
[23:18] but what did but re the reason he did it
[23:20] why
[23:21] for correction
[23:23] he only did it because they were doing
[23:25] something wrong
[23:26] he didn't do it because he just wanted
[23:27] to and he didn't think they ought to be
[23:29] no it wasn't he didn't think they ought
[23:31] to be there the bible said he said you
[23:33] have made my house my father's house at
[23:36] dinner thief he was quoting scripture
[23:38] so he had to fulfill that skill they
[23:40] were fulfilling that scripture and he
[23:42] just helped him
[23:43] get out of the temple
[23:45] a little bit faster than maybe they
[23:46] should have
[23:47] but he said upon this rock i'll build my
[23:49] church and the gates of hell shall not
[23:50] prevail against it
[23:52] let's go ahead and read number two quote
[23:54] number two what visions are
[23:56] 1956.
[23:59] skip the first one from thirst because
[24:02] brother brown says faith is a divine
[24:03] revelation
[24:04] that's the same thing with all of us
[24:06] it's a divine revelation
[24:08] it's not just a revelation it's just an
[24:10] aha moment it's a divine revelation and
[24:12] like we were talking some of us were
[24:14] talking the other day if you get a true
[24:16] revelation it'll never leave you
[24:18] it will never leave you if you get a
[24:20] true revelation it will never leave you
[24:23] no one can talk you out of it doesn't
[24:24] matter how many preachers get in the
[24:26] pulpit doesn't matter how many naysayers
[24:28] come by if you get a revelation of who
[24:30] you are
[24:34] it's solid
[24:36] and nobody can shake you from that
[24:39] nobody you know like we've stood before
[24:42] people in the daniel 70 weeks and they
[24:44] poor people can't understand
[24:46] we're reading the bible
[24:48] you got to make the prophet's message
[24:51] compared to the bible
[24:54] and it does
[24:56] but not your thinking
[24:58] amen but you stand in the face of that
[25:01] like dad stood in the face of it since
[25:03] the early 70s you just stand there
[25:06] and you let god do what he needs to do
[25:08] don't worry about what they think
[25:10] because you know what
[25:14] nobody's ever proved it wrong
[25:16] oh they give their ideas
[25:18] but no they ain't going to prove it
[25:20] because it's bible
[25:22] right
[25:23] some people in just a few weeks ago had
[25:25] questions about said did i believe there
[25:27] were seven years of tribulation i never
[25:29] said that
[25:31] never have i said that
[25:33] but there is seven years left after the
[25:35] rapture
[25:36] according to the bible have y'all heard
[25:38] bible
[25:42] oh sorry
[25:43] bible
[25:46] it's the b-i-b-l-e
[25:48] read daniel 9. read the bible amen
[25:52] and he shall confirm the covenant with
[25:54] many for one week i didn't quote that
[25:56] right
[25:57] god did
[25:59] and who was that he that's the
[26:00] antichrist we won't be here what's one
[26:02] week seven years
[26:05] never have we said that there was a
[26:07] seven years of tribulation
[26:09] it's only three and a half years
[26:14] but there's seven years left to finish
[26:17] the 70 weeks of daniel
[26:19] according to the
[26:22] thank you
[26:23] y'all get it in a minute
[26:25] but not really and then people fight you
[26:27] over and they're fighting the bible
[26:31] they're fighting the bible
[26:32] and they won't come to church now
[26:34] because they're you quoting the bible
[26:38] how can a christian not come to church
[26:40] if you quote them the bible
[26:47] shows where people's at
[26:49] all
[26:50] listen we're all going to manifest who
[26:53] we are
[26:54] you can sit there with stone face all
[26:56] you want to you can stand there and
[26:58] smile all you want to you can do it but
[27:00] we are going to manifest who we are
[27:04] when this thing comes down to the very
[27:06] end
[27:07] you know what judas probably he was like
[27:10] this is great man praise the lord
[27:12] yeah
[27:14] then he then he did what he did just
[27:15] right before they crucified him just a
[27:18] few minutes a few hours before they
[27:21] crucified him
[27:23] oh you know what brother colleen i was
[27:24] going to tell you that scripture that
[27:26] you read psalms 116
[27:29] you know in tradition this is tradition
[27:30] in the tradition of the jews the bible
[27:33] tells us either in luke or john one of
[27:34] the
[27:35] no mark or luke it says they when they
[27:38] left the upper room they sang a hymn and
[27:41] then they went in the garden of
[27:42] gethsemane that's what they were saying
[27:45] they were singing psalms 116.
[27:47] if you'll read that psalm 116 you'll see
[27:49] exactly why they were singing that psalm
[27:51] 116 amen so that was good
[27:55] but i was reading up on that one down
[27:56] and it said that the tradition of the
[27:58] elders says that that's what they saying
[28:00] when they went out to the garden of
[28:01] gethsemane right before he died
[28:03] that next day so let's read what our
[28:04] visions
[28:09] you know i got happy this morning right
[28:11] last night this morning
[28:15] because of the christmas story
[28:18] what we call christmas story
[28:20] but the bible talks about god coming on
[28:22] earth in human flesh
[28:25] i got excited about it
[28:28] i ain't worried about what they think
[28:29] about it out there in the world i'm
[28:31] talking about what he's done for me and
[28:32] you
[28:33] that he had to come as a baby
[28:36] for me
[28:37] not for you for me
[28:39] he came as a baby for me not because it
[28:41] was december 25th which it was not
[28:44] december 25th he didn't come to the
[28:46] world so we could give christmas
[28:47] presents
[28:49] he came to the world to give us the
[28:51] greatest gift
[28:53] brother brown said god's wrapped gift
[28:55] what'd he wrap it in not a swaddling
[28:57] clothes you wrapped it in human flesh
[29:01] because he had to be human flesh so he
[29:03] could die
[29:04] so see the bible says that'll be this
[29:06] afternoon there'll be a day that will
[29:08] not be either light or dark but in the
[29:09] evening shall be light now when the holy
[29:12] spirit first fell on the church that was
[29:14] what now
[29:15] 120 in the upper room on the day of
[29:16] pentecost everybody with me
[29:19] don't fall asleep already
[29:21] bob they're falling asleep on me
[29:24] he's in mobile
[29:25] now when the holy spirit first fell on
[29:27] the church it was in the eastern people
[29:29] in jerusalem the 120 in the upper room
[29:31] that's over there right
[29:33] right
[29:34] where the holy ghost that's where the
[29:36] holy ghost fell and great signs and
[29:37] wonders was done by the church in the
[29:39] early pentecostal age of the early
[29:41] church
[29:42] then the next round of apostles then
[29:44] come in the catholic church which
[29:46] catholic is in rome moving a little
[29:48] further west
[29:49] all right
[29:50] then 1500 years
[29:52] luther wesley was in where um germany
[29:57] britain
[29:58] see how it's getting right there john
[30:00] wesley's right and even john wesley came
[30:02] to the united states he actually was in
[30:04] the in savannah for for a long time he
[30:06] came to savannah georgia to try to
[30:08] convert the indians
[30:10] how to church there in in savannah
[30:12] georgia and then he wasn't very
[30:14] successful because that's not where he
[30:16] was supposed to start preaching at there
[30:17] was one to come to preach in america
[30:20] he needed to go he needed to go back to
[30:21] england so god sent him back to england
[30:23] where he just tore the whole place up
[30:25] amen
[30:26] then the next round of apostles then
[30:28] came the catholic church then 1500 years
[30:30] then the lutherans and then from then on
[30:32] down it's been a day where the light
[30:33] went out it's been a daylight enough
[30:36] that you could see that jesus was the
[30:38] son of god what he said i'll build my
[30:40] church on that
[30:42] you should repent
[30:44] but the real bright light of the holy
[30:46] ghost has never shined through these
[30:48] ages
[30:51] certainly
[30:52] the bible said it would as the prophet
[30:54] said it would just as sure as he said
[30:57] they couldn't believe because isaiah
[30:59] said there wasn't been light because the
[31:01] prophet
[31:02] said but remember he promised light in
[31:05] the evening time
[31:06] all right there's been enough light to
[31:09] know that you ought to do right and
[31:10] wrong
[31:15] there's been enough light to know that
[31:16] you believed on the resurrection of the
[31:18] lord jesus we all have to believe on the
[31:20] resurrection we believe he resurrected
[31:22] or we couldn't get saved
[31:23] amen
[31:25] accept him as personal savior put your
[31:28] name on the church book and live the
[31:30] good life
[31:33] but as far as signs and wonders and
[31:35] direct rays of the sun shining it hasn't
[31:36] been since pentecost and i'll add a
[31:39] little bit to that sorry i'm going to
[31:40] add a little bit to that because he and
[31:42] now he's talking about where pentecost
[31:44] come then i say the word come
[31:47] brother brown brought the word of god
[31:49] pure and unadulterated to the people
[31:51] he tried to do what he could because
[31:53] we're going to read here in just a
[31:54] little while where he had to indict this
[31:56] whole generation and i mean we talk
[31:58] about you talking about talking about
[32:01] some uh
[32:02] denominations
[32:04] let me read you what he said i'll read
[32:06] it to you in just a little while
[32:08] and listen it's not the denomination
[32:10] remember it's the people it's not the
[32:11] people it's the denomination they're
[32:13] under all right
[32:14] because you and i if you're in under
[32:16] false if you're under false today you're
[32:18] in a denomination
[32:20] if you're under false pretense if you're
[32:22] if you have your own revelation your own
[32:23] idea of things you're on you're a
[32:25] denomination
[32:28] because what is a denomination it's a
[32:30] doctrinal difference that you can't
[32:32] agree with this one
[32:34] so you move over to this one
[32:36] and if you don't like this one there'll
[32:38] be another one over here that the devil
[32:39] will give you that you can go to that
[32:40] one
[32:41] all right but listen remember god built
[32:43] his church though on the good people
[32:46] that were in that church
[32:48] amen
[32:49] listen there's going to be thousands
[32:52] upon thousands the bible says can't
[32:55] number them
[32:57] that's going to come up in the
[32:58] resurrection through all these church
[33:00] ages that were born again
[33:03] believers
[33:05] bride yes got the same new birth you do
[33:10] but they didn't have all the fullness
[33:11] they didn't have all the light only a
[33:14] little bit of light shown on the world
[33:15] like i said last sunday up until
[33:17] luther's age nobody even had a bible
[33:20] even when they tried to do it the
[33:21] catholic church took it away from them
[33:23] said just believe what we tell you
[33:25] so they all they had to go on was that
[33:27] you know what if that's all they had to
[33:28] go on
[33:30] god couldn't condemn them for not having
[33:32] a bible
[33:36] i mean i thank god a prophet came one
[33:38] time and he said you know he said those
[33:39] heathens in africa that's never heard of
[33:41] the lord jesus he said they'll be judged
[33:43] by what by how they live in their tribal
[33:46] order
[33:49] how about that
[33:50] and you know what they'll be given
[33:51] eternal life if they live their tribal
[33:53] order same way with the indians over
[33:54] here the indians that we drove out they
[33:57] they the happy hunting ground the the
[33:59] the sun and the spirit and all that
[34:02] they were spiritual people you know what
[34:03] geronimo was a spiritual man brother
[34:05] brown said saw visions how do you know
[34:08] that
[34:10] there was no documentary back then
[34:12] to tell him that
[34:14] god told him that
[34:15] so he can make an example and show us
[34:18] that god is not
[34:21] god's looking for a what do you say an
[34:23] honest and a contrite heart
[34:26] but you got to do that honest and
[34:29] contrite heart
[34:30] you know a lot of people say god knows
[34:32] my heart well yeah probably no he does
[34:36] he knows the fullness of your heart
[34:38] so you can't just sit at home you know
[34:40] you know he knows your heart
[34:43] he knows your motive and your objective
[34:45] and listen brother brown said if your
[34:46] motive injective is right he said god
[34:48] come on scene
[34:50] so that's what i want i want i was
[34:51] praying last night i said god
[34:54] let's get our motive and objective right
[34:56] not just come to this church not just to
[34:58] have
[34:59] you know eat good dinner and have a good
[35:01] comfortable place to sit that'll make
[35:03] you all fall asleep because it's hot up
[35:05] here
[35:06] what's temperature
[35:08] is it 70.
[35:09] okay it's we're in that transition time
[35:11] where it's not
[35:12] hot enough outside to turn the air
[35:14] conditioner on so and i ain't moving and
[35:16] i'm still hiding
[35:19] but that's what god said he said look he
[35:21] said there's enough night light enough
[35:23] light to know that you ought to do right
[35:24] and wrong
[35:25] there's been enough light to know that
[35:26] you believed on the resurrection the
[35:28] preachers preached
[35:30] the preachers preached they preached
[35:32] their heart out
[35:34] accept him as personal savior put your
[35:35] name on the church book and live the
[35:37] good life but as far as signs and
[35:39] wonders and direct way of the sun
[35:40] shining it hasn't been since
[35:42] pentecost
[35:44] but now what happened there was a
[35:46] restoration back to true pentecost
[35:49] not 1906 i'm talking about 80 30
[35:51] pentecost where they baptized in the
[35:54] name of the lord jesus christ well they
[35:55] received the holy ghost they knew jesus
[35:57] wasn't a third person of the second
[35:59] person of the trinity and they knew they
[36:01] didn't receive the third person on the
[36:02] day of pentecost
[36:04] they received thee person
[36:06] peter said this is that
[36:08] that i'll pour out my spirit upon all
[36:09] flesh
[36:11] amen
[36:13] so now let's go
[36:15] let's skip some of this so we'll
[36:18] not be too long let's go on down if
[36:19] y'all don't mind
[36:20] let's go quote genesis 18 3 because
[36:23] remember
[36:24] god promised he would send the son of
[36:26] man back
[36:28] in the end time
[36:29] all right if he sent the son of man back
[36:31] just go to genesis 18 3 where abraham
[36:34] met melchizedek
[36:37] keep going right there and he said my
[36:39] lord we know what that is that that's
[36:41] that's adonai which means
[36:43] a man in fl god in flesh so he was
[36:46] meeting jehovah god god in human flesh
[36:49] so look at quote number four
[36:51] who is this melchizedek brother adam
[36:53] said god in this stage is this stage of
[36:55] his creation later formed in the flesh
[36:57] jesus we'll get to that this afternoon
[36:59] from the fir great beginning spirit then
[37:01] came down to be the word bringing itself
[37:03] out the word doesn't yet make itself it
[37:06] just spoke out in morphe later he
[37:08] becomes flesh jesus mortal to
[37:10] death for all us sinners so in a
[37:13] nutshell he's saying just as jehovah
[37:15] jehovah created everything and he
[37:17] carried those people down through the
[37:18] old testament
[37:19] he appeared as melchizedek he appeared
[37:22] as a as the uh captain of the host
[37:25] moses saw his backside but that wasn't
[37:27] jesus the flesh
[37:29] that wasn't the savior that's that's
[37:31] that's in isaiah said he'll give he'll
[37:33] give his soul a ransom
[37:36] but he gave his body as a sacrifice
[37:39] amen he had to be a lamb a lamb has to
[37:41] have flesh see in revelations 5 there's
[37:44] a lamb took the book
[37:47] now a lamb can't take a book
[37:51] a lamb has a hoof
[37:54] but in symbol john knew who that was
[37:57] that was the son of man
[37:59] standing there in human flesh god
[38:02] taking the book of redemption
[38:06] amen
[38:07] and brother ryan said and redeeming
[38:09] those that were in the book
[38:11] by him being in flesh
[38:15] so when abraham met him he was
[38:16] melchizedek he unfolds here what all the
[38:20] attributes will do in the final end and
[38:21] what are me and you with me and your
[38:23] attributes of god
[38:24] in the final end listen folks if this
[38:27] ain't the final end
[38:31] no this is the final end
[38:33] this thing can't go on too much longer
[38:35] there's things happening that we don't
[38:37] know about there's things happening that
[38:38] we do know about but i know one thing's
[38:40] for sure
[38:41] i know the one that knows the end
[38:46] he said he'd never leave us or forsake
[38:47] us he unfolds here what all the
[38:49] attributes will do in the final end
[38:51] every son of abraham
[38:53] every son of the faith will absolutely
[38:55] do the same thing what meet god in human
[38:57] flesh
[39:00] and have discernment and do what take a
[39:03] body change
[39:04] see the rite of redemption it keeps
[39:06] going we see it revealed here in ruth
[39:08] and boaz what were they they were flesh
[39:10] people
[39:11] amen so god had to come down in human
[39:13] flesh
[39:14] to save mankind we know that he could
[39:17] not redeem
[39:19] as being jehovah
[39:23] listen
[39:24] he could not redeem being jehovah
[39:28] jehovah
[39:30] was god above them
[39:32] and only were readed this afternoon only
[39:35] by the blood of bulls and goats
[39:37] with sin covered
[39:40] not done away with so when that covering
[39:43] was over he had to go back and make
[39:44] another sacrifice when that one year was
[39:47] over if that priest didn't give that
[39:49] take that blood and put it on the on the
[39:52] corners of the altar
[39:54] the whole of israel
[39:56] were killed because of their sins
[39:59] so every year there's a remembrance
[40:00] we'll read it there in hebrews every
[40:02] year there's a remembrance
[40:04] because jehovah god was up here the
[40:05] angry god the one that looked down
[40:07] through the look down through the smoke
[40:09] in the fire
[40:12] but to be a redeemer
[40:14] he had to come through that
[40:16] and that's why i was telling you about
[40:17] that when i was reading the christmas
[40:19] story
[40:20] it threw on my heart
[40:23] how many times have you read something
[40:24] then all of a sudden it just really
[40:25] thrills your heart
[40:27] i mean you even anything else it just
[40:29] thrills your heart even in the bible you
[40:31] read that and you say man
[40:33] that's what he really did for me
[40:35] he went through all that why didn't god
[40:38] just wipe him off to begin with and just
[40:40] start all over well that wasn't his plan
[40:43] because he had you in his mind
[40:46] and he had you in his mind
[40:48] here
[40:50] in this church age
[40:52] so you had to be here in this church age
[40:55] to fulfill the attribute that he saw
[40:57] before the foundation of the world
[40:59] that's true predestination by
[41:01] foreknowledge
[41:03] amen
[41:05] that's another thing see you
[41:06] you people
[41:08] i had a guy call me
[41:09] about a year ago and he said
[41:11] i'd come out to your church and
[41:13] and go to your church if
[41:15] if your views on predestination were
[41:17] different
[41:20] i don't think the game goes to church
[41:21] now but
[41:23] i said my views
[41:28] i said i read y'all in the bible where
[41:30] it said buy for
[41:32] knowledge those he foreknew
[41:36] bible
[41:38] those he foreknew he did predestinate
[41:41] because they believe it's just signed
[41:42] sealed delivered there's nothing you can
[41:44] do you know like god's going to pull you
[41:45] through a tube and you just you know
[41:47] you're just brain dead
[41:48] no i don't believe that
[41:50] i know y'all don't either but the bible
[41:52] says by foreknowledge that's what i told
[41:54] you that's what i told that brother
[41:57] i said brother i said i was quoting you
[41:59] bible
[42:02] he never said another word he just got
[42:04] off on hunting or something
[42:05] i knew he didn't he didn't understand
[42:07] what i was talking about to begin with
[42:09] but i'd come to church with you if you
[42:11] change your view i said i'd have to
[42:12] change the bible
[42:14] i'd have to literally change the whole
[42:16] bible
[42:17] brother brown said the whole part of
[42:18] predestination is built on foreign
[42:20] knowledge
[42:22] for knowledge first because it's for
[42:26] knowledge
[42:28] knowledge before
[42:30] before it even happens he foreknew those
[42:33] he did predestinate
[42:36] oh my goodness people
[42:38] you see though
[42:40] can i make this statement
[42:42] we've come a different way
[42:47] oh we've come a different way
[42:49] [Applause]
[42:51] because the preaching of the word in
[42:52] this church from starting with brother
[42:54] mode all the way through brother dale
[42:55] and all of us ministers we've come a
[42:57] different way
[42:58] i'm sorry
[43:02] i'm just i'm well you know what if
[43:04] that's not my testimony then i'm going
[43:06] to go somewhere else
[43:08] but why am i going to go into confusion
[43:11] where they can't even quote the bible
[43:15] i can't believe people don't read the
[43:16] bible well you know what they read
[43:18] quotes
[43:19] well folks brother branham had to be
[43:22] quoting the bible
[43:23] he was a bible prophet
[43:26] you're just not getting what he's
[43:27] talking about
[43:32] but listen that's that's under the son
[43:34] of god ministry you can be that you can
[43:36] be confused
[43:39] that doesn't mean those people are lost
[43:41] right pop that don't mean they're lost
[43:43] don't mean they're going to hell
[43:45] they just don't understand
[43:47] they live a good christian life they put
[43:49] their name on the book
[43:51] they know what to do right or wrong they
[43:53] don't cut the hair they don't you know
[43:54] they do all the do's and don'ts they
[43:56] pray to god they go to church they pay
[43:58] their time they do everything but they
[44:00] just can't go up to that next level
[44:03] they just can't go up to that next level
[44:06] listen the disciples couldn't go up to
[44:09] that next level because they didn't have
[44:11] the person inside of him
[44:14] but now that was back then
[44:16] that's where he built his church though
[44:17] on the holy ghost coming into those
[44:19] 120 in the upper room and then they
[44:21] dispersed out into the
[44:23] into the world i guess you might say but
[44:26] now remember see so satan gets a hold of
[44:28] it
[44:29] and for and for four more church ages up
[44:31] to columbia where the catholic church
[44:33] took over there was a lot of truth
[44:36] but there was a lot of error that was
[44:38] being poked in there
[44:40] that was not god
[44:44] listen
[44:45] jesus christ is the son of man
[44:48] he had no fault in him
[44:50] he had no false doctrine in him
[44:55] that's your son of man
[44:57] no false doctrine
[44:59] jesus didn't have to be corrected
[45:02] okay that's what we're gonna have to
[45:05] come to oh brother what did you say we'd
[45:06] never be corrected no they didn't god
[45:08] never took listen it don't matter you
[45:10] got the holy ghost you got the baptism
[45:12] holy ghost you're signed sealed and
[45:13] delivered but you know what
[45:16] god still put deacons
[45:18] and preachers
[45:20] in the body to keep you straight and me
[45:22] straight all right so but you know why
[45:24] because we're a dual person
[45:26] we got the holy ghost in our soul
[45:28] we got some of that old nature
[45:30] that we try to keep
[45:32] that needs to die because see that's not
[45:34] working on your soul
[45:35] that's working on your spirit realm
[45:38] that's not working on your soul your
[45:39] soul's already signed sealed delivered
[45:41] your soul is eternal
[45:43] it's working on your spirit realm
[45:44] because it's what contrary
[45:48] jesus never had a fight with himself
[45:51] i had one this morning with myself
[45:54] okay
[45:56] that you didn't
[45:58] huh
[45:59] yeah you did louise thank you bro god
[46:02] bless you
[46:03] for being honest
[46:05] and awake
[46:09] praise the lord it is still hot up here
[46:11] aaron
[46:12] i'm glad i'm not one of them andrew
[46:14] glover i'd be absolutely sweating like
[46:15] you wouldn't believe
[46:19] so what did god do
[46:21] god winked at their ignorance through
[46:23] the church ages
[46:25] he winked at their ignorance in the old
[46:27] testament
[46:28] because he knew
[46:30] these prophets
[46:32] were going to come on the scene these
[46:34] prophets isaiah jeremiah ezekiel daniel
[46:38] all these different ones in the old
[46:39] testament and they were going to
[46:40] prophesy that it was going to be
[46:42] dark during a certain time
[46:44] and then the evening time there was
[46:46] going to be light
[46:49] but see god didn't require a rapture in
[46:51] the first age he didn't require rapture
[46:53] in the second age third age fourth age
[46:55] fifth age
[46:57] sixth age
[46:58] but he required a rapture because
[47:00] there's no more church ages
[47:03] can't go any further there's no more
[47:05] church ages so god required a group of
[47:07] people to
[47:09] eat not even just come back to the faith
[47:11] of the fathers
[47:12] that's the son of god
[47:15] but to go back to that son of man that
[47:17] spoke to them before the son of god got
[47:20] here
[47:20] amen
[47:24] i hope you understand that that's how
[47:26] important this is because luke 17 verse
[47:28] 28 says even thus shall it be in the day
[47:30] when the son of man is revealed
[47:32] he's been hid folks
[47:34] he's been hid but he's to be
[47:36] revealed in the end time under a sodom
[47:40] condition lord of mercy are we not under
[47:42] one
[47:46] worse than sodom
[47:49] because it's not just two cities it's
[47:52] the whole world now
[47:54] even though shall it be in the day when
[47:55] the son of man is revealed revealed
[47:59] reveal means to be made known
[48:02] and when something is revealed it has to
[48:04] be made manifest
[48:06] amen
[48:08] i mean listen have you ever held a
[48:10] revelation inside of you
[48:12] i haven't
[48:14] when god tells me something i like to
[48:15] tell people about it
[48:17] amen
[48:18] when god saved your soul that was a
[48:20] revelation wasn't it
[48:22] and you wanted to tell everybody about i
[48:24] hope you did i hope you didn't want to
[48:25] hide
[48:28] i got i got i got saved
[48:33] i don't do that no more
[48:36] no i was proud when god saved my soul
[48:39] cause it was a work
[48:43] wasn't sweaty for him but it was for me
[48:45] amen
[48:47] oh so y'all all came in easy okay that's
[48:49] fine that's good well just beat on the
[48:51] preacher then
[48:55] but when the son of man is revealed
[49:00] then we know that god showed himself
[49:01] through moses
[49:03] joshua we're going to read that this
[49:05] afternoon so let's go to quote number
[49:07] five the unveiling of god
[49:10] because god
[49:12] had to send a prophet
[49:14] that was so close there you go
[49:16] that was so close to himself now listen
[49:18] to me
[49:19] so close to himself the same signs the
[49:22] same wonders
[49:23] the same everything jesus did but now
[49:25] listen this man was not jesus
[49:28] remember what's the requirement of being
[49:29] the son of man
[49:31] you got to be virgin born
[49:33] that knocks everybody out
[49:36] everybody amen
[49:38] so they even william branham but listen
[49:40] but god told us we could live close
[49:42] enough to him
[49:44] even by our natural birth but we deny
[49:46] our natural birth and take on the
[49:48] spiritual birth of the one that didn't
[49:50] need a birth
[49:51] amen
[49:55] that's why they couldn't tell the
[49:56] difference when brother branham would
[49:57] now listen what about a man that you
[49:59] stayed around with and you went hunting
[50:00] with and he said you said well brother
[50:02] brown you know you're just sitting there
[50:03] with you you haven't brushed your teeth
[50:05] in three or four days you hadn't took a
[50:06] bath in a week don't ever try that
[50:08] and um they're sitting around the
[50:10] campfire really i mean they're out
[50:11] hunting and and one of them's going well
[50:13] brother brown i think i'm going to go
[50:15] over here
[50:16] and hunt over here and he's like
[50:19] no he sees the vision
[50:20] he said no he said i think i'd go over
[50:22] here go up this trail go up two
[50:24] mountains move over to the left and
[50:26] you'll find some game right there well
[50:28] if you lived around that all your life
[50:29] and it came to pass every single time
[50:33] you'd think god was sitting there
[50:35] because who else would know that
[50:38] but it was him using and yielding
[50:40] himself so much to god
[50:43] that god could use him
[50:45] to do that
[50:46] same way with discernment and all these
[50:48] different things that he did telling the
[50:49] people what they were going to do and
[50:51] what they had done in the past and
[50:53] can't be anybody but god
[50:55] and that is the bible because brother
[50:57] brother brown said you know jesus was
[50:59] have visions he'd have that's why god
[51:00] would tell him he told him through
[51:02] visions he'd have a vision he said he
[51:04] had a vision he knew he's going to raise
[51:06] lazarus from the dead it took him four
[51:07] days to get there
[51:09] because he knew he's gonna raise you
[51:10] from the dead anyway
[51:11] but look first he came as a prophet now
[51:14] this is what the son of man the son of
[51:16] man is what the prophet
[51:20] the lord himself will raise up a prophet
[51:22] like and unto me said moses
[51:24] all right
[51:25] so the prophet the son of man is the
[51:27] prophet
[51:28] notice he came as a prophet they
[51:29] crucified him his own crucified him he
[51:32] came as the son of man
[51:34] then after the holy ghost came
[51:37] son of man was crucified he went to
[51:39] heaven in acts 1
[51:41] ascended up sent back on the day of
[51:43] pentecost the promise of the holy ghost
[51:47] then after the holy spirit came
[51:49] because remember that body that god had
[51:51] prepared jesus
[51:53] couldn't be on the earth
[51:56] while we're on the earth
[51:59] because he declared we're his body
[52:01] paul declared we're his body
[52:04] and members particularly he talks about
[52:06] written epistles known and read of all
[52:08] men and all these different things about
[52:10] us being his body
[52:12] so he couldn't have two bodies here at
[52:14] the same time so he had to take the
[52:16] original body up
[52:19] put it on the throne wherever you want
[52:21] to say i believe he's in the seventh
[52:22] dimension where brother brown couldn't
[52:24] go where brother bob couldn't see him
[52:25] because he's in the seventh dimension
[52:26] because he's reached immortality
[52:29] then after the holy spirit came he was
[52:31] then the son of god
[52:33] that's when he came back on the day of
[52:34] pentecost
[52:35] god inside of human beings he was the
[52:38] holy spirit son of god he lived through
[52:40] the church ages as son of god now in the
[52:43] millennium he'll be son of david sitting
[52:45] on the throne of his father david he is
[52:47] the son of god now and remember between
[52:50] the son of god see here's the promise
[52:52] that me and you have i want you to make
[52:54] sure this is a promise to me and you
[52:58] now remember brother brown said take god
[53:00] promises
[53:03] and do something with him because if he
[53:06] promised it somebody's got to be there
[53:07] to receive it
[53:09] between the son of god and the loudest
[53:11] sin church age
[53:13] they put him out behold i stand at the
[53:15] door and knock
[53:16] and in luke he said he would be revealed
[53:19] again
[53:20] as son of man i just read that to you
[53:21] luke 17 30 and all the different ones
[53:23] that we're
[53:24] familiar with
[53:26] as son of man the prophet now remember
[53:29] brother brown was not the prophet
[53:31] he was a prophet
[53:33] revealing the prophet
[53:37] because brother brown said the messenger
[53:39] of this age is what the lord jesus
[53:40] christ amen the prophet fulfilling the
[53:44] rest of it the scriptures tie perfectly
[53:46] together son of son of man son of god
[53:48] son of david
[53:50] but now remember god promised though
[53:53] that right in here
[53:55] he'd come back at the son of man that's
[53:56] what he's saying right here he's going
[53:58] to be right here because what is son of
[53:59] david son of david's after that last
[54:01] week that we're talking about of daniel
[54:03] 70 weeks when the millennium starts he
[54:06] will be the son of david
[54:08] but he's got to come back he's the son
[54:10] of god now he's got to come back as the
[54:11] revelation of the son of man then he's
[54:13] going to be revealed as the son of god
[54:15] to the jews
[54:19] amen
[54:20] then he's going to be the son of david
[54:22] promised that he would sit on the throne
[54:23] ruling the 12 tribes of israel where me
[54:26] and you are going to be there on a
[54:27] honeymoon
[54:28] amen
[54:30] i hope you all understood that and
[54:31] studied it that's that's something that
[54:33] shouldn't be a question in your mind you
[54:35] should know why the millennium is not to
[54:37] us
[54:39] we're eternal
[54:41] millennium is time brother brown says
[54:44] over and over he said it's it's to prove
[54:46] the sin curse is over your sin curse got
[54:48] over way before that
[54:51] if you become if you become the bride of
[54:53] jesus christ your sin curse is over with
[54:55] yes
[54:56] that's right
[54:58] you say oh no quit looking at this
[55:01] because it's going to be changed
[55:03] and this sin curse is going to be over
[55:07] it's a great drama
[55:08] he's acting it out
[55:12] you know why god's doing all this
[55:14] to prove the devil who he is
[55:17] and to prove that he can work through
[55:19] something that satan marred
[55:22] because satan marred every one of us
[55:24] what god's fault
[55:26] oh yeah we say it was our fault it was
[55:28] but it's satan in to us is what causes
[55:31] us to do the things we do
[55:32] okay
[55:35] now let's read number six the indictment
[55:39] you need to read this whole
[55:41] because basically he's telling them
[55:43] watch i'll just let him
[55:46] remember they were very religious people
[55:50] that did that
[55:51] are you talking about the crucifixion
[55:53] because they didn't crucify the son of
[55:55] god
[55:57] you can't crucify the son of god
[55:59] that's spirit god
[56:01] you crucify the son of man
[56:03] which is a human flesh person
[56:05] you got that not a different person but
[56:07] a human flesh same person in there
[56:10] and we'll get it at this afternoon or
[56:12] later on because when we get to the
[56:13] crucifixion we got to see that the body
[56:15] was tor the sp the soul was tore out of
[56:17] the body all right
[56:19] remember they were very lit but listen
[56:21] we got to get the body inside that flesh
[56:23] first i mean the soul inside that flesh
[56:25] first that's what we're talking about
[56:26] this afternoon
[56:27] that's the christmas story remember they
[56:31] were very religious people that did that
[56:33] they wasn't outsiders
[56:35] they were religious people of that day
[56:38] and that's what's doing it today
[56:41] is the religious people
[56:44] same crucifixion
[56:47] same thing
[56:48] today
[56:49] quickly
[56:51] there they crucified him
[56:54] remember how he explained all that they
[56:55] are the most religious people religious
[56:57] place in the world they the most
[56:59] religious people
[57:01] the most horrible death
[57:03] they crucified the son of man
[57:06] then then sure
[57:07] when they were rejecting god's word made
[57:10] manifest accepting their creeds instead
[57:14] of the word
[57:16] now he's talking about caiaphas but he's
[57:17] also talking about today
[57:20] right
[57:21] i'm just going to read you what the
[57:22] prophet said
[57:23] is that what they're doing today
[57:27] that's exactly doing the same today
[57:31] he was the word and they rejected the
[57:34] word
[57:36] that's one point i want you not to miss
[57:38] see i want you not to miss
[57:41] he was the word and when they rejected
[57:43] him they rejected the word
[57:46] and when they did reject him they
[57:48] finally crucified him
[57:50] and that's what they've done today
[57:56] crucified him kill the son of man again
[57:58] that's why the son of man had to come
[57:59] back in the end time
[58:01] and that's what they've done today
[58:03] reject the word of god and accepted
[58:06] their creeds
[58:07] and has crucified publicly
[58:10] before their congregation
[58:12] the workings of the holy ghost or the
[58:14] holy spirit
[58:16] and they're guilty and i indict them
[58:19] in the name of jesus christ
[58:22] there's your indictment
[58:25] he's not in die he's not indicting
[58:28] the drunks
[58:30] he's not indicting the whoremongers he's
[58:32] not indicting the prostitutes
[58:35] he's indicting those people sitting in
[58:37] that church at that moment plus
[58:38] everybody else that's got a
[58:40] denominational idea
[58:41] and they're guilty and i indict them in
[58:44] the name
[58:45] of jesus christ
[58:48] how strong is that we say oh that we
[58:49] don't need now they're they are good
[58:51] people
[58:52] but if they accept that religion and
[58:54] become blinded by it then they're part
[58:55] of that order
[58:57] and there's nothing you can do about it
[58:59] amen
[59:01] so now let's go to number seven proving
[59:02] his word
[59:05] then i want to read
[59:08] something to get us ready for this
[59:10] afternoon
[59:13] now after 1900 years
[59:15] with the church ages past and all the
[59:18] things that he prophesied of luther
[59:19] wesley we just went through and seen it
[59:21] drawn out and the moon come down and
[59:23] draw it out and the lord brought it on
[59:25] the board here for us and showed it
[59:27] come down himself and confirmed it to be
[59:29] right
[59:30] why can't these people see that and they
[59:32] think he's a false prophet and they
[59:34] think they just he conjured all these
[59:36] things up
[59:38] come on people agree they're they're
[59:40] blind there's no doubt
[59:44] he confirmed that this prophet was right
[59:46] listen he confirmed this prophet
[59:48] you know why he confirmed that you know
[59:50] how i know he confirmed him
[59:52] because he confirmed him to me
[59:54] he confirmed him to me
[59:56] that's how i know he's right that's how
[59:58] i know he's there's no faults in this
[1:00:00] message because he confirmed it to me i
[1:00:02] don't know about you you've got to
[1:00:03] decide for yourself but he confirmed it
[1:00:05] to me
[1:00:09] after 1900 years and we're at the end of
[1:00:11] the layout to see in church age he
[1:00:12] promised in luke 17 30 we read it that
[1:00:15] this same son of man he promised it
[1:00:18] would be revealed in the days like it
[1:00:19] was in sodom upon the earth
[1:00:22] did he do it does it have to come to
[1:00:24] pass it's impossible now he stops his
[1:00:26] thought i believe he was going to say
[1:00:27] it's impossible for it not to pass now
[1:00:29] remember he came in three names the son
[1:00:31] of man a prophet
[1:00:33] the son of god the spirit
[1:00:36] remember come back on the day of
[1:00:37] pentecost and live through the church
[1:00:39] ages then son of david for the
[1:00:41] millennium which has nothing to do with
[1:00:42] us
[1:00:43] but in between this conjunction now
[1:00:45] according to his own words
[1:00:47] in the day when the son of man shall be
[1:00:50] revealed luke 17 30 reveal himself as
[1:00:53] what
[1:00:54] not son of god now listen he revealed
[1:00:57] himself as the son of god through all
[1:00:58] the things i was telling you about
[1:00:59] believe on the name of the lord jesus
[1:01:00] christ baptize the name of the lord
[1:01:02] jesus christ receive the baptism of the
[1:01:04] holy ghost do right do good do what
[1:01:06] you're supposed to do live a good life
[1:01:08] you know what brother anne brown brother
[1:01:10] brown told him on the sixth seal
[1:01:12] he said go on as you are live a good
[1:01:14] simple life he said because it's gone
[1:01:16] from you you know what he was telling
[1:01:18] him he said son of man has not been
[1:01:19] revealed to you yet
[1:01:21] and he'd been revealing him the whole
[1:01:23] week
[1:01:25] see how simple that is he was set there
[1:01:27] the whole week and he said i was hoping
[1:01:28] y'all would get this
[1:01:31] preaching the greatest message he'd ever
[1:01:32] preached no one had ever preached that
[1:01:34] except jesus himself
[1:01:36] that's how great that message was for
[1:01:37] that week right and he was on the sixth
[1:01:40] seal
[1:01:41] and they didn't have a clue what he was
[1:01:43] talking about
[1:01:44] but he didn't call he didn't say y'all a
[1:01:46] bunch of bastards
[1:01:48] he didn't say y'all much an idiot
[1:01:50] he said no go on and live a good
[1:01:51] christian life
[1:01:54] they know what he said don't live a good
[1:01:56] christian life this is not for you this
[1:01:58] is for somebody else it's going to be
[1:02:00] revealed in other words in a different
[1:02:02] way
[1:02:06] in the day when the son of man shall be
[1:02:07] revealed reveal himself as what
[1:02:10] not son of god
[1:02:12] son of man will reveal himself in a
[1:02:15] different way now when when you say that
[1:02:18] everybody's like well it's got to be
[1:02:19] just something totally different no it
[1:02:21] doesn't
[1:02:22] the son of man came on this earth the
[1:02:25] very guy
[1:02:28] listen folks he was the absolute
[1:02:31] old testament walking on two feet
[1:02:33] absolutely
[1:02:35] not a second person
[1:02:37] and listen a jew don't believe in a
[1:02:38] second person they believe in one god
[1:02:41] they believe when god comes back as a
[1:02:43] messiah it's going to be god
[1:02:46] in human flesh and they missed him but
[1:02:49] he was literally the walking old
[1:02:51] testament but he came a different way
[1:02:53] than what they wanted him to come
[1:02:56] will reveal himself in a different way
[1:02:58] now what does that make malachi 4
[1:03:00] exactly right the son of man will reveal
[1:03:02] himself not in a whole big denomination
[1:03:04] and things as we've been through the
[1:03:05] ages but he would manifest himself as
[1:03:07] son of man again to make manifest
[1:03:10] malachi for and in that day i will send
[1:03:12] you elijah the prophet he shall turn the
[1:03:14] hearts of the children back to the faith
[1:03:16] of the apostolic fathers
[1:03:18] what do you have to do zerubbabel had to
[1:03:19] clean the foundation off
[1:03:21] and rebuild
[1:03:23] right
[1:03:24] he didn't make a new foundation
[1:03:27] swept that one off he didn't make a new
[1:03:28] foundation foundation was already there
[1:03:32] he just built up this statue of a
[1:03:34] perfect man so me and you
[1:03:36] could climb up there with him
[1:03:39] he said oh brother wait we can't get up
[1:03:40] there where brother brown was at i know
[1:03:42] we can't get exactly where he was at
[1:03:44] because i'm not a prophet
[1:03:48] but you know what
[1:03:52] i can get close
[1:03:54] because i'm telling you
[1:03:57] he's laying in the grave
[1:04:02] the headstone didn't come while he was
[1:04:03] alive
[1:04:04] not the fullness
[1:04:06] the fullness of the headstones in me and
[1:04:07] you
[1:04:09] we need to pull him out of the grave
[1:04:11] that doesn't belittle him and make us
[1:04:13] know better it puts a position that
[1:04:14] we've got to come to
[1:04:16] that we've got to see
[1:04:18] that that headstone
[1:04:20] is the bride of jesus christ
[1:04:23] nothing else but us
[1:04:25] but how'd he get here all right let's
[1:04:27] read now remember he was the whole of
[1:04:28] the old testament
[1:04:31] he fulfilled like what was it 400
[1:04:33] scriptures just right when he was
[1:04:35] crucified
[1:04:38] but i say he fulfilled every one of them
[1:04:41] the whole time he was alive
[1:04:43] from genesis 1
[1:04:45] all the way to malachi 4.
[1:04:50] but he came a different
[1:04:52] way he didn't come the normal way
[1:04:55] brother brother came a different way
[1:04:57] they loved him when he was
[1:04:59] healing the sick and raising the dead
[1:05:01] and praying for their people and sending
[1:05:03] them i mean he feel churches full
[1:05:06] they don't get the holy ghost he said
[1:05:08] y'all got the holy ghost he said go find
[1:05:09] you a good full gospel place to go to
[1:05:11] church he was filling their churches up
[1:05:14] but buddy about 1960 61 62 63 obviously
[1:05:18] and on further into his ministry huh
[1:05:22] no
[1:05:24] they hated him
[1:05:25] they won't have nothing to do with him
[1:05:27] no more if it wasn't for that what
[1:05:29] brother carl williams i think with the
[1:05:31] full gospel businessman he'd have never
[1:05:33] got in them anymore
[1:05:35] but thank god somebody kept the door
[1:05:37] open so he could come in and preach and
[1:05:39] we could have the tapes
[1:05:41] didn't matter about them sitting there
[1:05:42] i'm sorry for them people they're
[1:05:43] already gone on but i'm getting what he
[1:05:46] said
[1:05:47] hey man i'm getting the real reason he
[1:05:49] came amen he didn't come just to heal
[1:05:51] the sick raise the dead sure jesus
[1:05:53] didn't either
[1:05:55] he came to save your soul
[1:05:57] we'll read that this afternoon so let's

[1:07:37] in the millennium under their time
[1:07:40] but not for us and upon his kingdom upon
[1:07:43] the throne of david and upon his kingdom
[1:07:45] to order it and to establish it with
[1:07:48] judgment and justice from henceforth
[1:07:49] even forever the zeal of the lord of
[1:07:52] hosts will
[1:07:53] perform this
[1:07:56] this afternoon
[1:07:59] we're going to see that first scripture
[1:08:00] fulfilled because gabriel is going to go
[1:08:02] talk to that virgin
[1:08:04] this may be simple as it can be but i'm
[1:08:06] telling you i had a i had a good little
[1:08:08] i had a good little pentecostal revival
[1:08:10] last night just going through this again
[1:08:11] to know what god did for me
[1:08:14] to know what he did for me
[1:08:16] and how it all got started
[1:08:18] and that he's gracious let's stand to
[1:08:20] our feet he's gracious he knows what we
[1:08:22] need he knows how we need to get here
[1:08:26] he knew we were going to have to come
[1:08:28] born and sing shaping an iniquity
[1:08:29] especially my mother's room a liar
[1:08:31] doomed and on our way to hell lived uh
[1:08:35] brother claude says the hound dog life
[1:08:40] but you know what if you're born again
[1:08:41] today god never saw a bit of it
[1:08:44] he don't remember it
[1:08:46] it never happened
[1:08:49] we knew it did
[1:08:51] but he didn't
[1:08:54] that's why the son of man revelation is
[1:08:55] going to be a little bit different and
[1:08:57] we're going to talk about that because
[1:08:58] you know what he did he came different
[1:09:01] but he didn't come different from what
[1:09:02] the word said
[1:09:04] he came exactly the way the word said
[1:09:08] walked right up to caiaphas
[1:09:10] and said i am he
[1:09:12] and they crucified him for saying the
[1:09:15] truth
[1:09:17] that's why we're not so popular we tell
[1:09:19] the truth
[1:09:23] and when you tell the truth you're not
[1:09:24] popular oh that's okay
[1:09:26] let's sing a song god bless you
[1:09:29] oh there is
[1:09:33] [Music]
[1:09:38] shall come
[1:09:40] no more clowns

[1:09:44] and no more tears
[1:09:50] is
[1:09:54] [Music]
[1:10:07] that day is this
[1:10:09] [Music]
[1:10:12] day that will be
[1:10:14] [Music]

[1:11:07] god died in human flesh
[1:11:10] so that you and i could have eternal
[1:11:12] life
[1:11:14] will be
[1:11:16] with the one who died for me
[1:11:21] oh what a day
[1:11:24] a glorious day
[1:11:27] that will be singing to him
[1:11:30] oh

[1:11:33] days that will be
