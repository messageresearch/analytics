we see that we know this things that'll happen to Israel that's not pertaining to us but we should do get the spiritual part of it though and we see that God did have a time for Israel but the Gentile time is now and then it's going back to the time of Israel when we get out of here so they're waiting truely waiting on us to get out of the way so the thinking they can receive their message the whole world is groaning and waiting so am i cuz I can't find my temper give me a note and I don't know what it did with it I'll find it ha it's right where you laid it all right by way of

November the 18th and December the 16th remember those two days one service and we'll have our usual normal good time in the Lord so everybody okay let's turn to the Book of Revelations unless we're on part 11 of the I am the resurrection we want to kind of get to something today and then like I said it'll be a couple of Sundays before we get back so we let you chew on some chew on some things that Jesus told us they meant she want something Jesus told us amen let's bow our heads before we get started dear lord thank you so much for giving us a day to come out here Lord we are just human beings and we have a certain time of the year Lord that we have to make all these announcements and but Lord is for your people if your people Lord we're all still humans and we have human things to do Lord and I I think you told you disciples one day let's go take a little vacation so Lord you had a time that you went and rested up and did some things Lord that was that was fun with this disciples Lord and I pray that the things that we do at this church like what we did yesterday will be pleasing to you Lauren that we just enjoy ourself as humans and his families and bring our children in up in the admonition of the Lord that they may see that this is truly not some dull Christianity is not not a dull moment I don't think Lord I think it's I believe that it's it's an exciting time for us to be here it's an exciting time and exciting place to be father just pray that you'd forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we do make towards you Lord just cover them by the blood sanctifies for this journey Lord be with the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor probably give us this day our daily bread and Jesus name we pray amen and and before I forget it all the ones that that helped yesterday and it was that yesterday was probably the best we had had in a long time yeah you can go ahead and give yourself up I told them at the post office of the day I said if nobody pat you on the back all you got to do is extend that right arm raise it up like this and go that's stuff on the back but you did a real good job everything was great the singing afterwards those of you didn't stay man we had a service and then people got up and just sang and we had our little PA system and Richard played his bass and Aaron played the guitar and everybody sang we had a real good time so we missed the ones that weren't there we wish you could all come but that's okay I like being around people that are Christian you know you rub shoulders with all the other junk the rest of the time it's kind of nice to be you feel clean you know you feel cleaner than when you're around I mean you feel cleaner when you're around Christian people because you know there's there's some other spirit lords there they man disappeared the Lord's there so when he had opened the fourth seal now we're been on a for sale now for 11 times so we're kind of winding it down I want to get to something today maybe we can bring this to a close I heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and I looked and beheld behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him now they have names and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword with a hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth let's think let's do one more before we sit down John 11 Martha said unto Jesus Lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask him God God will give it to thee jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day she's putting it off jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe if doubt this you may be seated in the Lord as a blessing to the reading or believe us thou this now I was thinking as there's a sometimes when you're when you bring in something you have points and you think of a point and you go by it and you go over that point and I know most you ministers know what I'm talking about and then then you think man I've covered that point and then you go no it's a little something extra there's another thing that you want to bring out well you know what it's nice like Regina said this morning sister Regina we were talking about we've been in Romans 9 for a while and and we kind of got off of Romans 9 yesterday I mean last Sunday and she said well you're not reading this thing and I'm not you know we we start running the thing we put our own ideas in it but we let the Lord lead us in the way that we need to go sometimes even though you may think we go down a rabbit trail but that's okay it may be for somebody but not you the preacher may go down a rabbit trail for you one of these days and you'll enjoy that or somebody besides you may not enjoy it but you will so that's what we're trying to now I want you to see to that that we in all that we're looking at when we come to this fourth seal to me it's important because of bring up the remember part death has to be destroyed a restoration of all things take place a resurrection as the plate take place and a rapture takes place on this seal so the seal is like brother Dale said going I want you to understand well from last Sunday when we finished up last Sunday and we brought where brother Branham came at the end of the Pentecostal age I didn't make this point I want to make that point that that was the son of man ministry you can't have that the son of God works all the way even the Son of God mystery of the revelation of the Son of God comes all the way to now I was telling them this morning you have to be really you have to be able to do like the Bible says and separate the soul from the spirit and the body and bring these things in because if you don't you'll get confused amen so we come to a place to where Martin Luther received the Holy Ghost for his time in his hour amen and it was the true Holy Ghost but that true Holy Ghost never anointed that Trinitarian doctrine that he had couldn't can't but it winked at the ignorance of the man because of the tree that was eat down the word part that was eaten down then that wasn't March for Martin Luther to do only the just shall live by faith now I'm sure he preached everything else but God anointed that just shall live by faith God anointed in Martin of John Wesley's time sanctification live a holy life do the things right have a method of doing things then the Pentecostals come in in 1906 and it's very important to realize this in 1906 Azusa Street the Holy Ghost didn't fall on a group of Pentecostals and their doctrine of the Trinity are their doctrine of eternal hell it fell on a restoration of the gift because that's what was promised that was their box that God was working in there right with that say man that way we can understand how God works in this program that when we come to the end or the to that Laodicean Church age and we see that a messenger or that eighth not an eighth messenger but it is really an eighth the anointing of the eighth is that brother branham's message was restoring us by shaving off all this stuff that we were that we lost down through the ages and then we come to a time to where he brings his message now when he brings his message his message is truly eternal life now all the other messages were too but this is the eternal life for this guy for this guy that was to step up and that's what we're going to read you in just a little while we're brother Bram says it's a different anointing I'll read it to you that's why I'm in tally mentality has been done through the church ages live a good Christian life even brother Branham on the sixth seal he said go old as you are see they were still in that Pentecostal age hello go on as you are believe the same what was the same simple message what brother man had brought him to know eternal hell baptism in name Lord Jesus Christ one God revelation all the things that was lost in the church ages he had brought him to a position and he said okay you can't go any further than this because they were called any age that all right I'm just backing up a little bit on last week because they were called in that Pentecostal age the Pentecostal age doesn't take a body change but when brother Branham was standing AIDS has gone from you it's not for you and you're not going to get it well I wasn't there you weren't there some of you may have been there but we're here now we have moved in to the message of eternal life now they've had a message all down through the ages I think about this the other day they've had a message like I said Martin Luther how to mention wasteland a message but no one had a message that could bring that same man Jesus that same ministry back on the earth except the prophet william branham when he opens those seven seals because that was the whole bar that's why he stood at the door and knocked I will read it in a minute but I wanted you to see that when we put that chart up there you got it with you that last part when brother Branham comes at the end of the Pentecostal age he brings his message of the Son of Man I don't think I made that clear but that is the message that he brought because listen let's just be real just think for me a minute Jesus is standing somewhere in an eternal body glorified eternal body we know his spirit and soul was always eternal but you've got an eternal body amen but that eternal body in that form can't come back here until you and I get a body change just like his glorious body we read that scripture how many times you read that scripture will have a body like in his glorious body and we put it where somewhere in the heavenlies no folks will have it right here will either we won't we'll either have it here listen we're gonna have it anyway whether we all fell over dead today in our natural body you're gonna get a glorified body because those who he is justified he is all read I mean justified he's already what glorified I know I know tell your body that in the morning when you wake up I know but you got to believe that you got to believe that that's something you got to believe because we can't push it on to somebody else we got to believe it today that the son of man is not coming the son of man is here but the son of man couldn't do it just in one man named William Branham he wasn't the son of man he was revealing or what he was giving us the son of man amen I mean he's waiting on us with the message he brought but he had to be a mini membered body couldn't have been one man because if brother Brandon listen if he stood there as like I always said before when brother branham's said that denominational churches were nothing but lodges you look so maybes talk to people that they're just this all is is a large meet-and-greet you know drink coffee in the sanctuary and smoke a cigarette in the back you know and talk about what baseball football what happened today before now it's just become a social event but to you and I it has to become eternal life it has to become us building something they're not building nothing they're looked at well you know what they're waiting they're waiting on a kingdom to come and Jesus did say thy kingdom come but they missed the kingdom coming on the day of Pentecost because that's when the kingdom come established itself on the earth as the cornerstone but we're not looking at Cornerstone now we're looking at the thing that's going to cap it off and seal everything together so that we can get out of here so that God can literally change our body that's why I like that word in that second part of the quote to brother Brent that brother Dale always close literally turn us back literally is not something that you know you you're not looking for me to come I'm here I'm literally here I'm not a type I'm me same way with Jesus you say well the bride is the type of Christ be careful Eve was not a type of Adam she was Adam made manifest in another form called Eve so you and I have got to come to a place where Gina I'm off my notes what you say that for this morning we got to come to a place to where that's gotta happen you got to believe when he said I and my father are one you got to believe you say I my father one because when Jesus stood up one day we're going to read it when Jesus stood up Dan said you got to eat my flesh and you got to drink my blood or you'll have no part with me what have we come to sure they / took of the guy in all the ages they had their part but you and I have the full body seven-course meal the full body back in manifestation that all right so let's read here we'll get to something maybe reading them quote number one-third exodus we've read these before so but I like this one I'm gonna keep this one I made this petition on my refrigerator we put everything else on our refrigerator so that's the way it is again today God is calling his elected people and they are elected now now remember election is what God voted for you the devil voted against you you swing the vote two-to-one neither way we learned that this morning in Sunday school class so that's what election is election goes by foreknowledge they're all connected amen and now they are elected for what now you talk about us we're elected for a resurrection and what kind of sign is he showing them resurrection sign now when brother Branham would stand even when the Lord Jesus would stand and heal people all day long that was a resurrection sign brother Branham would come and and and have prayer lines for six or seven days straight back in his early ministry that was a resurrection sign but that wasn't the fullness that wasn't the fullness because I'll say a hundred percent of the people brother Branham prayed for has died I'd say close to 100 it's been a long time amen and I may they may be one percent left but they've all you understand what I mean though they've not come to a place to where that body can just continue to be eternal there was something dead changed they did listen when you have AG order and the Gorter disappears you had a body change when you had cancer all over your body and you were leaking fluid I never you know your eyes and nose of that girl was that brother man prayed for remember she was they brought her in in the sheet she had two blood old everything everywhere now when she got up and walked off that girl got a body change something changed there was atoms that changed something broke loose now our situation is is we glory in that but we stop we stop and go that was a good healing service that's gone the next day we had to have another great healing service the next day we had to have another great healing service why because we are going down in these bodies but now Jesus we come out of the grave with a glorified body hit the next day he didn't have to have his sounds regenerated no he was in the core of our body so that's what you and I but you didn't it early say well that's far fetched well how far you want to go how far fetched is it when you get a healing in your body you get a temporary resurrection and then your body is brought up to the place to where that thing's dying but in a moment of time your body is brought back and quickened into a resurrection temporary but now listen Jesus when he said I am the resurrection and the life he went on by the temporary resurrection now he did cause one to happen with Lazarus by temporary resurrection but Lazarus later on passed away now when we see this son of man standing on the earth today come on people when we see that today that's not praying getting better getting worse getting better getting worse we're going to come to a place to where something's going to sweep over us and it's going to what change us in a moment in the 2009 but we have to go through something before that happens we'll try to cover that a little bit today but you and I we are elected for a resurrection so that's our job that's our mandate is to take this thing to a resurrection a body change and a rapture that all right I'm gonna read you a quote in a minute what brother Bram said about a rapture my shotgun who is this son of man let's pull it out Nellis let's I told them we're gonna look at the characteristics I've been going back to reading Matthew Mark Luke and John again because if you want to know what the Son of Man look like act like and talk like read Matthew Mark Luke and John because remember when he come back on the day of Pentecost that was the son of God revelation that was the son of God in Peter the Son of God and Paul the Son of God and James and John and Peter and all them but if you want to know what the Son of Man said go to Matthew Mark Luke and John that's his characteristic that is the only time you're going to see Jesus Christ standing on earth not now then I'm talking about the man the person the one that came out of the womb not milk as a you say well what about this one none of those were your brother none of those even though that was God Almighty that walked in front of either of Abraham and Sarah that was not your Savior that flesh of that man call Melchizedek could not take stripes for you yet that was Almighty God standing there but that wasn't the son of man that was the son of God used in what elements of the earth in creating a body did his service and then stepped out of it and he was done captain of the hosts same way but when a man came like you and I come when we had we were born of a woman out of a woman he was born out of a womb he started as a baby he had dirty diapers he threw live he was a yeah he was a human that was the son of man that was the son of man so if let's look and see what the son of man did and it should answer our question all right he answered the senator them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man so listen letter we this man when he came on the earth there's nothing not have a wife to procreate with okay I was here 52 451 says who can declare this man's generation he was cut off from the land of the living why he was killed before he could have children literal children he had no progeny he had no generation change he had no he didn't further his he didn't have sons and daughters like we have sons and daughters a man but he had sons and daughters because he planted the seed in the earth he planted the seed where did it come from it came from his mouth if Adam and Eve would have stayed with instead of instead of protecting of what they per took of then we would have been fine we would have come spoken we're children because you know what that's what we're ending up as I spoken-word see children hey man so the good seed is the son of is the son of man the sower of the good seed so what when Jesus in Matthew Mark Luke and John every sermon that's ever been preached since the dawn of the day of Pentecost till today has been that three-and-a-half-year message of Jesus you said what about the Old Testament didn't the Old Testament speak in him the whole Old Testament spoke of Jesus Christ and then the whole prophets that that preached their sermon spoke of Jesus Christ so Jesus Christ that three-and-a-half-year sermon how many billions of sermons have come off of that man we call the son of man but you know what not over one percent of them understood who he was this day today is the only day we understand who he is the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom so what did he so he sold you and me he give us an opportunity to come the way we were supposed to come by spoken word that's why brother Dale keeps telling us the birth the new birth is the birth of the word it's the birth of the seed he that soweth the good seed remember the the parable the seed is the word he sowed the word if on your foot a minute the field is the world the good seat of the children the kingdom but the tares are the children looking one because remember Satan sow seed - he's sown seed in your brain right now now it's up to you whether to cultivate it or kick it out what are you doing with weeds pull it up we put we putting roundup on it now we don't pull them up no more we just put roundup well that's right liquid weed eater that's exactly right Susan loves that liquid weed even listen that's what we're using we're using a gospel to get rid of the weeds so we're giving it a pill when Jesus came to the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples whom do men say that I the Son of Man am and they said some say you're John the Baptist some say you're Elijah and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets he said are there but now what's your revelation I don't care what all these other people say what do you say in other words guys you live with me everyday you're with me the whole time what if I reveal to you about me that's what he's saying whom say ye that I am and the only thing Peter could say was because look there's never been a man born like Jesus Christ no one they never met anybody born like that and Simon Peter answered said thou art the Christ or the Anointed One the Son of the Living God now he did not answer the question we know that we've been through this for years Peter only and look jesus answered and said blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood didn't reveal that to you he spoke something he didn't really understand until the day of Pentecost and I say undelete that wasn't flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven because that's a revelation that Peter was going to open the doorway he wasn't going to open the door with the Son of Man revelation he was going to open the door remember Paul Peter I mean he's got the keys to the kingdom and I say unto thee thou art Peter and upon this rock a revelation I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it you know what that done that that loose that turned that key when Peter come under there Pentecost and said this is that this is that which was spoken by Joel he goes back to the Old Testament I'll give unto thee the keys of the kingdom whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven but he never told him the only time listen the only time that could be answered is now I was telling in Sunday school class right now we can answer that question who two men say i the son of man am you an hour to be able to tell him that because you know what when you tell him that that means he's present well if that don't excite you did Aaron what does that do when they don't you spoon fill out your bowl or whatever listen that don't stir your soul your spoon fill out your bowl so I guess some of you got too much bowl of chili yesterday and you gonna sleep some I I'd say German chocolate cake but Susan got one yesterday and that wouldn't keep me awake sorry anyway so let's go to the next one we laugh a little bit but this is serious because look watch what Jesus says jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up in the last days now somebody like to tell me Woody's dome out because he really has not given them a spiritual meaning here it is underlying but he's telling them because you say he keeps on for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed so in other words he's saying I know what you're thinking but my flesh is indeed what I'm saying my flesh is meat and my blood is drink he that is my flesh flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father has sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me now he didn't say live by the father he said live by him this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your father's did eat manna and our dead know we know what if you'll punch that in your computer that little word dead means eternally separated but he's talking about the people in the wilderness he that eateth of this bread shall live forever now look that word eat I looked up the word eat eat and eat if you see that word says eateth eateth scroll it back down again no right there dear that's not just one time brother BAM said we're feeding off the body word of the son of man right we're feeding now we're not we get one meal and that's it we're feeding off the body word of the son of man now that word eat means to consume or partake you know they eat an apple in the garden well they didn't eat an apple in the garden they per took of something right so you have to look at what that what Jesus is saying that when you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and a drink drink his blood if you don't do that you have no life in you now heal it now except you consume or partake listen you know what this did right here this drove people from him but that's the truth that's the truth but that grow people from him for a purpose because nobody ever heard that before let's keep going these things said he in the synagogue he said that in the church many therefore of his disciples when they heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them does this offend you because I'm sure in their humanity listen in their humanity they're going oh we got to eat this guy's flesh and we got to be a vampire you know and a drink is blood I mean Wow does this offend you what and if you shall see the Son of Man ascend up where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth now watch he just told them to eat his flesh and they would partake of him right it looks like he's contradicting himself the flesh prophet is nothing so he's telling him right there he's cutting them off he said I'm not talking about you eating my flesh because the flesh profiteth nothing it's the spirit that quickeneth the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who were to believe him not and who should betray him and he said therefore sit on to you that no man can come unto me except that were given unto him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back to walk went back and walked no more with him why they could not take that they had to be so intimate with that man that's what he wanted he wanted somebody to be intimate when when you partake uh something that makes you you're close you're intimate with it when Jesus was saying he says okay I'm gonna come and I'm going to give you the Holy Ghost but you're gonna have to enter in so much for my flesh my flesh is going to be your flesh my blood is going to be your blood and you're going to live off of it and that's what's going to sustain you the revelation of this word feeding we're feeding why can a whiny brother branham walk up in one day and said we're feeding on this body word of the son of man what we're feeding on this revelation that no one else has had they didn't even have it that's why many disciples were walking away now brother Brown said when the bride says I and my father are one and these other things this shucks will pull away why because they can't stand it they can't take that rich of a revelation hey man there's a lot of things I like to eat that's really rich you can't eat a lot of it to make you sick same way with this word of God they some people can't take it that's why you see them leaving that's why you see some of them just going off and you know say I can't take that cuz look and you know the old saying watch the old saying that's John 6 anybody told you that that's John 6 john 6:66 they walked away from 666 the number of man john 6:66 they walked no more with him why because they had a mark but that's just what people say so that's okay let's go to first Corinthians cuz I want you to see what now watch what are you done that was in John this is in Corinthians this has been revealed to Paul of the communion brother Dale we're going to do something about we're not going to be here the next Sunday for the communion either we're gonna be going so we'll have to do it in the middle of the month or what you whatever you decide but I just want to let you know we're not gonna be the two Sundays in a row or Ernie will be here and then the neck oh and next I knew we forgot forgot one we're going to the Duran's home that wasn't on my list of many things I had to say but next Sunday after the second service we need to get a GPS marker on their home and go have their house dedicated they're going to have shrimp pasta and rib eyes medium-rare baked potato so I'm just kidding just joking just kidding I just wanted to wake you out come over you're still asleep look Jesus so now watch what Jesus said now watch he comes and he has to look look at me a minute Matthew wrote down what he said by the Holy Ghost that wasn't just Matthew's writings that we read them in our John's I'm talking about John's writing that wasn't just John's writing John was in the upper room when this happened but he didn't have it he didn't have let me just play he didn't have the position to say what Paul did you know why because John heard Jesus say eat my flesh and drink my blood and I'm sure John had a little problem in his brain hey listen if a man you were following walks up and says you got to eat me and you got to drink my blood before you'll have any part women now you know your humanity would be like yeah but Paul didn't have a problem with it because Paul had already protect because watch and we had given thanks he brake it and said take eat now remember this is this is the Holy Ghost now running coming through Paul's filter coming through a prophet Paul a prophet Paul is now telling us and breaking it down of what to do take eat this is my body now what do you do he broke bread and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you that's doing remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had supped saying this cup which was wine is the New Testament that's why I'm still telling you all today or yesterday we're talking about Matthew Mark Luke and John is not - we've said it many times before it's not they're still in the Old Testament the true New Testament is when that testator died shed his blood that blood came back on the day of Pentecost cleanse those believers and made them a new testament because look the Bible even tells you there must be the death of a testator for there to be a New Testament so Matthew Mark Luke and John is not in the New Testament it's the Old Testament Jesus was born under the law I'm quoting scripture Jesus was born under the law and even when he would go and heal somebody of a certain disease he said go to the law Moses because remember in Moses time if you were a leper if you were cleanse you had to go show him and present a sacrifice Jesus didn't say well bless God you don't have to go and do the law no more I'm here no he said you're healed told my to Leopard he said go do the law of Moses in other words what presents yourself to the priest go they were still under the law his blood hadn't been shed the testator while he was alive there's no new testament its sole testament but this is the cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me so you say well brother then all we gotta do is take communion and we're fine no you got to take communion every day pull the piece of that I need it pull the pita not literally I'm talking about the word we got to eat this word when brother Branham when those seals open to that prophet that was the son of man not in brewing in Branham that was the message that hey the son of man is here the Son of Man has been trying to get in that door back in the church because they kicked him out there all right and like Bob said there were seven seals on that door cuz I'm telling you it's got this talk to y'all today Jesus broke the seals but remember I told you you and I showed them back up we seal it back that's what's happened down through the church ages that's why all that eatin went on when the tree cuz what we put we put we put the seal back on hey man we did but you know who really opens the seal Jesus Christ opens the seal but you know he doesn't open it to a tree or a bench or a car it's your revelation is what opens that seal your revelation is what opens that seal so that way I know the son of man's here if that revelation has been open then the son of man has to be here not out in the airwaves in you and me in the word that come forth I hope we see that this is the New Testament and we have a mandate in this New Testament that the son of man is back again he's alive in this church again proving his word 1964 this is the one I was going to tell you right here all right pull it back up now for 1,900 years with the church ages past and all the things that he profits out of Luthor Wesley we just went through and seen it draw it out and the moon came down moon came down and drawed it out and the Lord brought it out on the board here for us and showed it come down himself and confirmed it to be right after nineteen hundred years now what he's we're at the end of the Laodicean Church age now remember the Laodicean Church ages the shortest age there is little bitty short age compared to all the other ones he promised in Luke 17 xxx at this same son of man he promised it would be revealed in the days like it wasn't Sodom upon the earth did he do it does it have to come to pass it's impossible now remember he come in three names the son of man a prophet the son of God the spirit son of David for the Millennium but in between this conjunction now according to his own words in the days when the son of man shall be revealed revealed himself as what not son of God son of man will reveal his self in a different way now I'm telling you what he said a different way now not some of these strange doctrine but no it has to dovetail with the Word of God then alright it has to be the same he will reveal his now are you a recipient of that you have to answer that question because he worried who's gonna reveal herself to the trees the cars the no he's gonna reveal himself to somebody somebody's going to take it and say I believe that let's just sit under it and let's listen to it unless hear God speak to us in a way he never spoke to anybody else except when he was here his own self and they didn't believe who he was when he was here but you and I now have the Holy Ghost listen to me you and I have the Holy Ghost in our soul Peter James and John did not have the Holy Ghost in their soul before the day of Pentecost so they did not understand what he was talking about and they only stood understood parts of what he was talking about because when he left the headship went with him the headstone went with him that headstone revelation of the Son of Man went with come on he didn't come back on the day of Pentecost as the son of man he came back to Pentecost as the son of God the Son of Man revelation was left somewhere it was sealed up with seven seals that all rights a man or he can say owe me for those y'all there sleep you want to get you a rubber band or something and just keep doing this all right let's go to the next one see that's the point that's the pole part we're not getting we must realize this is now the honing time we're not shooting with a shotgun we've been shooting with a shotgun since the Apostles time Pentecost shot with a double-barrel shotgun whoever they hit the head no the honing time is what we're shooting at two to three at a hundred yards and we're hitting the bull's eye like this that's what I that's what we are because look the scatter was the shotgun pattern is list anywhere believe this believe that seven thunder versus all these different doctrines that's been in we got to hone it down to one point one thing the Son of Man meant message and ministry is here today somewhere you guys decide where it's at and you know what you may want to go somewhere where there's more emotion but if the words not being preached you can go to hell shouting and speaking in tongues but you can't go to hell with the Son of Man revelation in your heart you can't there's no way you can because God can't put herself back in Hell again he's already been in Hell one time God went to hell hey man you went with him so you ain't gotta go you don't been to hell you got a little more you don't have to go up one time now who is this who is the Son of Man in the beginning was the word the Word was with God in the word was gone and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and if all the teaching that we have in confirmation of the word of God by word of god by signs by wonders we see today that in the Book of Luke that we are just quoted now remember the signs and wonders and brother Bronze Age was what for what to catch the people's attention because we're fixing to get into the shout divorce and the arc and divorce of the Archangel and Trump of God all right well then that's what we're heading to because listen these street things has to happen before we see that come to pass all right so we'll go we'll read it we see today the Book of Luke here we just quoted of the Luke 1730 Malachi 4 in different scriptures were all acquainted with that that word again is waved over the people what word the word of the Son of Man was waved over the people that the Dead traditions of man is dead and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Ghost right among us and giving us life let's keep going now we'll go to Book of Revelations and who is now look let's go to the red part and then we'll skip through them we know that John looks John hears a voice and he turns to see a man he sees a man but this man has has become into a position that may be startled John a little bit because you heard a voice and turn around and look and saw one liking to the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle now I want y'all to realize you ever realized that through seven church ages it's been the bride feminist farm bride but they've never got that son of man revelation part what are you saying I'm telling you this message that we have a part of today is what's going to pull them under that son of man revelation and bring them out of the ground you said I can't do it no you're not gonna do it you're gonna let God do it but you know what you got to do you got to believe it you got to believe that that's your commission I'm telling you my Commission is a resurrection I have been elected to stand in this church age to bring a resurrection now whether you believe that or not I want somebody to believe it because if I fall down and have to go by the grave you somebody going to pick it up and get us out of the ground amen so this son of mass why I'm telling you this son of man Revelation is so important they never had a son of man revelation and back in in the seven church ages but we do and that's what's gonna bring them out that's what's gonna bring their bodies and change them right in front of us that all right number four seven Church ages this was in 1954 and in the midst of the seven golden counts today is one like the son of man what one like him who was this his bride one like him watch how it was clothed with a garment down to the foot the holiness of Jesus Christ covering her has washed us from our sins thank God with his own blood girded about the paps not a man a woman so this is all bride for me they're all right with that this is bride form John looks and he sees a man standing there Girt about the paps breasts in a feminist form but it's the son of man he said lock into the son of man and then you hear what did you said what liked him Oh Girt about the paps not a man a woman but remember their revelation was the son of God to the church ages believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be safe that's their Commission our Commission is to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved plus plus plus that plus the headstone coming back that's our Commission let's go to Revelation 3 now this is I'm not gonna read that go ahead and to the Angel the Church of the Laodiceans now these this is the age we're living in these things that say Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God there buddy understand that Jesus Christ was the way God wanted us created yourself created know that man created a car right we didn't create all the stuff that makes the car God created the stuff to make the car man just formed it put it together that's what this is it Jesus Christ was at the beginning as that beginning because we remember even brother Branham talks about this the faithful and true witness you think well Manny's false no that means it's got a true sound to it it's got a true you know this thing could be you can you can play a piano but it has a true sound to it when it's what when it's tuned it has a true sound to it that's not that he was false and now you become true no he's the witness he's the only one the beginning of the creation the God why he came the way we should have came I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot let's just keep going down to the bottom verse nineteen as me as I love and rebuke and chasten be zealous and repent we ended up with us a couple of Sundays ago behold I stand at the door knock see the man hear my voice the voice of whom not the voice of the Son of God the voice of the Son of Man because that man is standing at the door and he's knocking and you've got to open the door brother Branham gave us the seals 50 something years ago you've got to open them I don't think you believe that you think that just because brother Branham opened them they're open well why didn't we take a rapture when we took the body James White was have a resurrection why we still dying cuz the Son of man can't die not anymore if any man hear my voice in this last church a I will come into him and with what bring fellowship back that's our problem the seals remember I told you many many times the seals is not for the redemption of your soul there's many people going to be in heaven they never heard of seven seals and God birthed him into the body change their soul by the Son of God halation but you and i are not in that age your and I are in the age to where we want full fellowship God wants full fellowship back with us and then that's what the sales do the sales does the sales bring back to me full fellowship eat my flesh and drink my blood how intimate is that that's a pretty intimate amen now look at the Feast of the trumpets number five if you don't believe that's who that was I'll let the Prophet tell you now know there's still now this is on the Feast of Trumpets after the seals is broke know the solution of this ecclesiastical spirits now 20 years later after that war we see the loosening of the ecclesiastical spirit does everybody understand what he's talking about now the loosening of this ecclesiastical spirit 20 years later now when he talks about this he's talking about Eichmann and Hitler and the and the spirits being loosed under Eichmann and Hitler lest 1944-45 20 years later 1965 64 65 he's identified after that war we see the loosening of the ecclesiastical spirit what under the seventh seal the seventh trumpet to the Jew it was it was manifested in a man named Hitler and all them that took him kill physically killed people 20 years later what's he telling them he's telling them after the seals broke that your ecclesiastical system is what's killing you all right then look at the moon darkening out what under sea it thrown out the son of man being drove from the church that's why he's standing on the outside the only time you see him he's on the outside is in our age they put the son of man revelation out of the church and most people in the message is put the son of man revelation of the church hello I'm just telling you the truth what do you believe it or not your business now let's read this is where I want to get to right here mm-hmm let's see if we can put this together number first thessalonians what's it all familiar but this is what we've been working to know Jesus stood one day and said I am the resurrection and the life now you know what he didn't fill the gap in you and I got to fill this gap in but I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died now who died son of man died and who rose the son of man rose physically out of the grave Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord in other words this is exactly the way it's going to happen it comes by the word of the Lord for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain can we say we we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep in other words there's going to be some unbelief still here we which are alive and remain unto the coming of Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep because we're listen we're not going to resurrect them the words gonna resurrect them alright for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first alright the dead in Christ shall rise first give me about ten minutes and you can fall back to sleep again the Lord Himself now look the Lord Himself he's coming himself but the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God now listen folks put this on your refrigerator too because this is only talking to you there's no one in this world that that's talking to you I'm telling you that's what I'm saying when I started reading all this I'm like man this is so pinpoint and precise you can take that right there and you can put it right here and say that's talking to no one on the earth except me yeah thank you you got a real eye just talking to you and listen those that are going on not talking to them those that are in different denominations that's not to them this is to me and you that's why this son of man messages to me it's so clear that's it right there that's it for the Lord Himself showed you say he came under that Pentecost read it in the revelation of the Son of God not to revelation this on a man right this is the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first now listen here's my take on that if you're not dead in Christ now you're not going to rise first you can't be dead in Christ in the grave you got to die now so the ones that died in Christ here shall rise first that's the way I look at it there's nobody in the grave that's dead in Christ how can you put them two together but you can be here today and be dead in Christ those there had to be a death we haven't been through that there had to be a death under the third seal there had to be a death for you to get the new birth the old you had to die so we just go asleep we just sleep the people that are in the grave now they're just resting they're sleeping they're waiting and that's not so bad that's not a glisten no pain no agony no taxes coming up on April the 15th I mean really the things that we have to deal with God has put them away and said you don't have to deal with that anymore I've commissioned these people I've commissioned these people to get you out of the grave what do you think they're standing always ain't brother reaching in we're standing over on the side just going well today he's been alone no no no him and Gary Adkins and though we're gigs like this and Richards got his cuffs on and they're going man this is good Gary Atkins is like man I run it I run it couldn't run started come on people it's not as bad as we think it is and you know what they're done they're finished they're there all their way all they're waiting on is for me and you then we which are alive and remain because listen this is the great mystery that I have a problem with I still do I'm sorry I have a problem with we're gonna get them out of a grave they're gonna go glorified body and we're gonna have to wait around for a little while before we get our glorified body for we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together because the dead in Christ will rise first but you know that proves to me one thing it's not your body that's going to do it it's that spirit that dwells inside of you is going to do it but it's got to come from the voice of the Resurrection then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord but you know what we had a prophet come and fill in yeah cuz we're not going we're going to meet the Lord in the air alright let's take a little gap right here we got a marriage supper we got to come back into millennium we got to have a white throne judgment for the others not for us and then we walk into a future home when this comes up but we had a prophet to tell us what's inside of all that we had a prophet that's why I mean why do we worry why do we worry about things because we don't understand them right I am NOT an electrician I am not gonna walk over there and open that panel up and start fooling with stuff why I'm scared but you know what if you're in a master electrician that's no more to you than us you know putting a pencil in your pocket right why because you are trained you know what's going on you know what's happening you know what electricity they'll do to you you know what to wires not to put together which I wouldn't write that's what this is this is your training part to teach you how to handle not just your everyday life people people handle their everyday life since everyday life we're coming by handling the Word of God we're talking about handling the Son of man eating the flesh drinking the blood being intimate with the Son of Man wherefore comfort one another with these words that all right so now let's let them let brother branham explain this just for a few minutes in the rapture message now watch this people do they even when I go places to preach I tell them I said I am NOT looking for a rapture I am NOT raptures not even the Bible I'm not saying it's not going to happen what's what brother Brown said the word rapture in the Bible is not even used at all hmm we just put that word there hmm the Bible says caught up being caught up because what is rapture rapture is not look and don't get me wrong we say the rapture has been in process since the day of Pentecost and it has but the rapture is a one-time event one time we're going to be caught it we don't have four we don't have four or five raptures there's been raptures you and I to have one rapture one catching up so it's in the event it said what commit is you know what to me is it's the trophy at the end of the game you got to play the game you got to play it good and you got to win but when you win you get a trophy the trophy is God's gonna catch us out of this place amen let's read the brush listen the prophet so listen I'm not belittling the word rapture because brother Brown preached the rapture but he said the word raptures not even in the Bible listen the word rapture is ecstasy ar-ar-ar there's other words for it that I'm gonna mention but rapture is an ecstasy what is it it's it's what happens after something happens after something happens it's an ecstasy or a time that that's why I said we're gonna be boom we're gonna be caught up alright but I like to say we're gonna take a body change first well I mean we're gonna have a resurrection first we're gonna take a body change next and then we're gonna be caught up that's right that's what we're saying here we read here in 2nd Thessalonians 4 first Thessalonians this order of this great rapture that will take place in the last days listen to this here we're going to begin here with the 13th verse I wouldn't have you ignorant brethren concerning those which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others have no hope well we believe Christ died and rose again even so then which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for we saying to you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent that word prevent means hinder those that are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend now listen close the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the voice of Archangel the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first now I want you to notice a great thing taking place here don't miss it the word says here in 2nd Thessalonians he meant that there is three things from the 13th to the 6 theme verse there is three things that has to happen before the Lord himself appears quickly now so we can close same here the first thing happened I notice a shout a voice of trumpet let's read it again see it's right for the Lord Himself sixteenth first shall descend from heaven with a shout forced to the archangel and the trumpet of God three things happen a voice a shout the voice of trumpet how does that happen before Jesus appears now a shout Jesus does all three of them when he's he's descending the Lord for himself shall descend see that now here's the problem that the world has they're waiting on that to happen they're waiting on that to happen I a good friend of mine Baptists please come a little bit Pentecostal he said I'll be glad when I can see the cloud there I mean literally he's you can see it he's wanting the clouds to open and Jesus to walk down through the clouds till that's what he said you see the Son of man coming in the clouds of glory and I just told you my city before thinking I said if you see that you've missed rapture because that's not that's not a secret this thing we're talking about is a secret we're gonna be gone from here nobody hardly even know it alright you look at this message brother Branham brother Brian's message is available to the whole world and how many people listen to it one tenth of one tenth of one percent but it's available to the whole world but who's gonna listen a voice of shout Jesus appears now Jesus does all three of them when he's descending now what is a shout it's the message going forth the Living bread of life bringing forth the bride now what does a shout do hey yeah weights y'all thank you literally but what is a shell when somebody shouts you know if you see a great group of people and if one person shouts what do you do it gets your attention basically when they shout real out it gets your attention this message is what got our attention so that God could speak to us cuz listen the letter killeth you can read every quote you want to and it will kill you and send you down but if you ever hear the voice behind that now look now prophets no one to read don't you see this there is such a thing as gift of prophecy in the church but a prophet is predestinated and for Dane for the hour now watch him slide what he's doing is he's sliding his position right in and telling them where he's at and he's telling us yes sir now if a prophecy goes forth two or three has to set and judge whether it's right or not for the church can receive it but nobody set before a prophet in other words I'm telling you the brother Dale has always said if you can correct brother Branham then you have injected yourself between God and him so that makes you the Prophet because there's nobody stands between a prophet except God that's what he tells you right here but nobody set before a prophet in other words brother rom didn't have to prophesy we'll get into that later prophesy and two or three people had to judge what he's saying no he's a prophet what he says is the truth and it comes from God but nobody said before prophet goes he was absolutely the Word of God he was that word in his day you seen God reflects now God has promised to send us that again in the last days to bring the bride out of that ecclesiastical mess in the only way it can be done it'll never it'll never be done the church can't receive Christ we the Pentecostals you saw about that age we can't carry this message on in the condition that the church is in today in other words you know what brother Brown was doing he's telling them I am preaching to you what's going to change you but you're not listening you're shouting you're wanting the healings you're speaking in tongues you do you're not getting the message the first thing comes when he starts descending from heaven there's a shout what is it it's a message to get the people together what's it done look at us we're all we came from we didn't know each other most of us didn't know each other before we came into message wow this is bringing us together all right it's a message to get the people together a message come forth first now lamp trimming time rising trim your lamps what watch was that the seventh not the sixth read your Bible will be ten virgins all right now it's the first thing is the sounding and what's he telling us though he's telling us what age is coming in not the six to seven now it's the first thing is the sounding first thing is the trumpet neigh gets a little bit confused here but that's what he brings it back the first thing is the trumpet and or a voice a shout and then a voice and then a trumpet shout a messenger getting the people ready the second is the voice of the resurrection now you can say the message to get the people ready could be the years of preparation or you could say it's the fullness because the second is the voice of the resurrection listen the voice of the resurrection is when you open the door and let Christ then that's the Son of Man the Son of Man is the resurrection son the voice of the resurrection the same voice was 'watch the loud voice in Saint John 11:30 844 that called Lazarus from the grave getting the bride together then the resurrection of the Dead to be caught up with it now watch the three things take place the next is water trumpet of voice he he gets a little mixed up here be careful where they call this a shout the voice in the trumpet that okay everybody say shout voice trumpet shout boys trumpet that's the way it happens shout to get the people together the voice of the Resurrection what what did he sweat was the voice of the resurrection the first thing he said was I am the resurrection that's what you got to believe oh we believe Jesus was the resurrection really do you still dying if you believe he was resurrection he said believe without this you'll never die mellow getting the bride together and in the resurrection of the dead sea to be caught up with it now watch the three things take place the next with the trumpet avoid a shout out of the voice of trumpet now the third thing is the trumpet which always at the feast of the trumpet is calling the people to the feast and it'll be the bride's supper because remember watch the seventh trumpet - Israel is the same as the seventh seal - you know there buddy got that same am the kingdoms of our Lord has become the kings of live is Christ now that's over in their age if you're talking about the trumpets because we're not here when a trumpet sign but the seven seals got to open here that the kingdoms of what right here this kingdom - he's talking about now the third thing is a trumpet which always at the feast of the trumpet is calling the people to a feast that'll be the bride's supper the Lambs supper with the bride in the sky the first thing comes forth is his message calling the bride together the next thing is the resurrection of the sleeping bride the one's died back in the other ages they're caught together and the trumpet the feast of the heavens in the sky why that's the thing that takes place friends so the message does what get your attention something you never heard before get your attention then the voice of the resurrection has to come from that same shout can't be shout different than voice shout the voice and resurrects all the same thing it's got to be the same what our problem is is we haven't had it in continuity before now we have it in continuity where the shout the voice and hold that together right there okay then all right that trumpet we're hearing the trumpet because the trumpets what he just said it brings you together too but what's he bringing us together to to go to the marriage supper but it also brings Israel together to take them to earth they get them as alright with that so you and I have a commission first thessalonians i want you to say this with me you ready say it with me class 1st Thessalonians 4 13 through 18 it's talking to me and I am going to make it come to pass stand Evie now believe it because that's it the voice of the Resurrection has to come through I love human beings I want to tell you what the angel said one day everybody's coming into the everybody's coming into the tomb of Jesus and they find out he's gone what they do they start looking around right they start looking around and I love what that angel saying the angel says we leave them well they took my lord I took my lord they took my lord he said why seek ye the living among the dead that's my point to you why seek ye the living among that dead thing out under this dead thing right here amen why seek ye the living among the dead this is the live message let's sing a song brother jokes I'll get us a song when that for steel he's made alive to you we're gonna leave this place there's nothing can hold us here I'm headed home me and June saying that yesterday for the others y'all that weren't around it's there's nothing can hold me here I'm headed home heavenly gates are near it won't be long till I'll be walking on streets of gold singing around God's throne nothing can hold me here one of them 151 less say if you have a need most of everywhere whose hearts are all the point where the father fell at Pentecost explains they made them clean it is burning now in my heart all glory to his name I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them one of them you know they could say I would've them but you and I can say that one of them that's going to make that resurrection happen you and I are going to be recipients of this thing I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them though these people may not learn to be Narbo stop worldly fame they have all received their Pentecost baptized in Jesus name and are telling now before if powers yeah it's the same I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them I'm one of the one of them I'm one of them I'm one of them oh I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them oh they were gathered in the upper room all praying in history times with the whole let God II started but you and I are gonna be later strike understood everything but I knew that God had changed something in their life and that's what happened on the day of our pinnacle come out and walk into our body and Travis takes one of the I am one of them oh I'm so glad that I can say I've listened to this oh god my brother seek this blessing that will cleanse your heart from sins that will start the door bells ringing and will keep your soul aflame it is burning now within my height you like the organs [Music] and don't play myself there had to help it oh I'm one of the I can say I'm one of them say I'm one of these you know sometimes when you read the Bible and you read it three or four times and you think well that didn't say that the first time I read it that's God speaking to you he's illuminating a part of the scripture that you may have read 25 times or 30 times or 100 times but then now see it become time where you could take it you got to look at it that way you say the Lord why he can't listen he ain't gonna dump all this on us at one time we can't take it but if he it's like it's like the old saying about how do you cook a frog you don't throw him in the boiling water you put him in some warm water and let him sit back cross his legs but you keep turning the temperature up finally you got to cook frog he just don't know it well that's the same way with the devil he's a cooked frog he just don't know it yet and he's gonna try his best and that's his job and he's good at it so now you can say the devil of the Frog but he's not gonna prevent or hinder us getting our job done our job our mandate is to get those dead people out of the ground and the only reason that they come out of the ground is because death has been destroyed in somebody's life and you say well I hope it's me hope I hope it's me Jesus didn't walk up the ladders to say I may be the resurrection in life no I like those two words they're real short but they're very powerful I am before Abraham was I am Moses I am that I am I'm that one that's gonna carry you through they're all waiting on those folks sure we've had resurrections temporary ones but they're all going back again this one won't be man there'll be such a vacuum that'll pull them out listen it's gonna pull Paul out of the ground Peter James John all them will come out of the ground we're not just going with our group but I like what the scripture says those that are last will be first and those are the first to be last so you and I are gonna be the first ones we're going to see our group first I believe because the revelation is there and the revelation needs to be here that you and I are recipients of first Thessalonians that's the only group of people that's talking to it's talking to you it's talking to me so you know what it's not gonna make itself manifest then words has got to come off the paper and be alive in our life it's got to come off the paper because you know what people's read 1st Thessalonians since probably the 1500s when they put the Bible together we what you're alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent or hinder those were asleep but the trumpet of God so son nobody heard a shout nobody heard the voice you and I've heard a shout you and I've got the voice and the trumpet will sound in a group of people let's bow our heads their heavenly Father thank you for this day we prayed to what we said have been pleasing to You Father we pray Lord that we'll take these things and pondered them in our heart Lord and let them become part of us truly we are the chosen we are the elect the predestinated the foreknown of God to stand in this day in this place and Lord be a part of you father we pray that you'd be with us now as we go our separate ways be with us on the highways keep us all safe or there's many ones that are sick among us lord I pray that you as your word went forth today that it would just heal them Lord and give them truly a temporary resurrection because we do we do like the temporary resurrections not doing away with m'lord but we're we're working for the time that the dead Saints will come among us and that'll be a reality Lord knows we were thinking the other day about even going into the future home and things it just sometimes it's it seems like a story to us we've been told these stories for years but Lord those stories you've got to come to pass those stories have got to be not stories anymore they've got to be lived by a group of people and I believe that we are living the vision but that vision has become reality now and we're standing in human flesh just where you wanted us this is where you wanted it to be this is the time you wanted it to be this is the place you wanted it to be and lord I pray that we would step up to that hour as we say step up to the plate and do our job do the things we're supposed to do Lord forgive us of our many mistakes and and being dilatory and not praying is what like we should or studying like we should Lord just help us to do better and that will all come back together and you Lord on Wednesday night prayer and preaching Lord give him the words of eternal life for us Lord I believe their eternal life words I believe that they're taking us right into eternity father Lord would prejudice you just be with each one take care of us on the highways again Lord keep us safe until we come back together in you in Jesus name we pray amen you're dismissed you
