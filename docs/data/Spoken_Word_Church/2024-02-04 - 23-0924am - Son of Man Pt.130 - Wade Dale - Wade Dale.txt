over but his son's still Shining if you don't mind have a seat for a minute and I'll go over some of these announcements it may take a minute thank you all for your prayers for uh brother Dale and for um more importantly now for the Hal Thomas family and uh like brother Joe said I was kind of reminiscing some things and and uh he was um he was a man that could take a coat hanger and a pair of pliers and build the Empire State Building he could he we go fishing or hunting you know when I was in earlier life and U I'd have all this gear on and he's like you ain't going to need that you ain't going to need that you ain't going to need that here's a can of worms let's go fishing that's right you know so that's just the way it was so we're going to we're going to um celebrate his going home um do do you believe the Bible you believe the Bible amen amen now what does the bible tell us cry we be sad that's not what the Bible says the Bible says in Psalms 116 precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints precious we're supposed to cry when a baby's born and rejoice when someone passes but we humans have that totally backwards we love the little baby and we laugh well let's turn this thing around let's Rejoice wouldn't bring him back Janet wouldn't bring him back Debbie none of the family would bring him back no no no no you say well he's in a better place he's in the place he's supposed to be he's in the place that God saw him before the foundation of the world he didn't take him no sooner he finished his race and we sure appreciate the Lord for letting us know him in pretty much all my life amen and pretty much all the life of the of the brothers and sisters here he's been uh we started with them 1968 in Gainesville and we've known him ever since so we appreciate the family and and love them with love of the Lord Arrangements will be made later so we will let you know now uh for as far as food uh see sister Esther our sister Rachel uh the church is going to provide the the meat uh but uh you guys can provide all that other good cooking that you do to feed the family after the funeral so we uh we sure appreciate them taking the Reigns and saying we will do it so we you see them if you need anything uh they'll tell you what to bring all right so let me just give you a little update on Dad I know and I want you to understand something as even brother how Thomas's family we all love him we all want to be around him but a man old man taught me a long time ago wasn't even a believer he said son he said when you're a baby he said your world is real small people you it's just you and your family your family takes care of you your family feeds you your family changes your diaper your family protects you right all right good to have our brother back here with us today good to see you man God bless you I'll let Lis introduce you um in a minute but then he said as you get old as you get older said you you know you Branch out and you you have your own family and you have your own life he said but once you get older he said everything starts coming back together to where you don't travel as much you don't feel like traveling as much you feel like staying at home home is the best vacation you'll ever have when you get older all right so you Danny's over there shaking his head but you see everything's coming back together but what does it come down to it comes down to your family your family is your core and and we respect family decisions we don't make decisions for families except ours all right so that's the way we should be we should we should be that we respect the decisions of any family that has any um tragedy or anything that's going on on I I told him down at the funeral for the little child the other day Little Lily I said look I said tragedy does not destroy a Christian it defines them you think of that I didn't get that from a book I do that from exper knew it from experience it defines who you are you look in the Bible what would we know of job if he hadn't went through a tragedy Samson would have never killed 3,000 pH things if he had went through a tragedy so a tragedy should Define us and make us stronger and not make us weaker amen so as being Christians we take tragedy as something that we build on right and that we're building on that dayto day in our daily life and now we have a church family and we have families branching out but when it comes down to the time of going home the death of of or or sickness it just kind of works back down to just your family all right right and we sure appreciate our church family um and we appreciate the family that we've that we've grown to love and and know and we appreciate the prayers I was thinking this morning I thought you know anybody know what a haym maker is some of you do not know what a Haymaker is a haym maker is is somebody just comes up and just I don't want to say that other word but just yeah cold knocks you yeah well you know the devil thought he had he thought was you know going after a child of God and uh he got a Haymaker your prayers okay your prayers was a hay maker that the devil didn't see coming it's one of them punches he don't see coming listen I we need to give them back to him I don't want a haym maker from him I want to be able to him to receive one and knock him out and I was thinking this morning all the prayers you know we've always talked about a battle it is a battle it's even a spirit spiritual battle even when you're you're dealing with sickness there's a battle there Satan and his demons want to give more to you God is over here with his angels wanting to give you more faith more strength more stability so it's a battle and that battle is listen we're going to absolutely just flood the airwaves and we have with prayers for even for for brother how's family and also for Dad um uh one day this past week I'll just kind of give you a little update um cuz I I don't want to give if you give so much information if you don't give all the details everybody's got oh he's got a brain bleed he prob problem well let me explain just a few minutes what went on uh he come to a place he was he was unresponsive he wouldn't eat and he wouldn't talk and he couldn't get out of a chair by itself so um Terence and Mom and them were there there was a therapist there that was looking at him and she said you need to call call the U 911 and and let them check him out so when they checked him out they said you know assessing what they what they saw they said you need to take him to the emergency room all right so we took him to the emergency room he was very weak and um he stayed in there that place was packed I'm telling you this sickness is just the world is just sick they were treating people out in the ER well y'all know some of you are nursers they were treating people out in in the Y they wasn't even taking them back to the back and me and Terence and Anna sat outside boy there's some weird people out there too but we sat outside and I know there was a sign on us that said one lady asked y'all Christians we said yeah she said are y'all Christian witches she said you know there Chris good witches I don't know what Anna T said to her but she turned and went the other way so anywh who I didn't know there was Christian witches I first thing I'd heard first time I'd heard so uh she just needed some money to go to Buford that's kind of what she wanted so u p gave her some money and sent her on her way so but there I'm glad she went that way Buford can have her but anyway so there was we did there it was a CT scan done and a CT scan showed that there was not a brain bleed as it bleeding it had it had been knocked or something happened to it several weeks months they don't even know and what had happened was it had put a little bit of pressure on his brain but the actually and this is how great your body is the doctor told us the neurosurgeon finally that came in later on the neurosurgeon said uh your body is wonderful when your blood is wonderful when it stays in veins but when it comes outside the veins the body hates it it's full of iron and proteins and different things that the body does not like so and I could relate to it in the beekeeping world in the beekeeping world if there's something ever gets in that Hive they will actually encapsulate it in propolis and seal it off right to keep it pure well that's what the dad's brain had done it had made a membrane around that blood and encapsulated it and kind of just kept it there all right so in in that it sounded so bad it wasn't so bad that it was leaking and bleeding and all this stuff okay so just wanted to let you know that but it did make him weak and the different things the neurosurgeon said no surgery not going to do it we're going to move on to something else so um when when you when you give out something and and give pieces of information it sounds really bad and and it is it is tough on an older person an older person you know as well as I do it's harder for them to fight things but prayer is the great equalizer I mean it's the great equalizer all right you can say well let's over hereit well faith well that's well prayer all right so we're a believing bunch of people we believe as we keep going on that he'll get better so they had to put a feeding tube in his nose and that wasn't very good um he has swelling in his limp nose so we're going to see an oncologist later on maybe the Monday or so he's on medication the medication is working Anna was with him where's Anna Anna was with him last night and he was very responsive yeah she's asleep I'm sorry we've been kind of staying 24/7 so if I got a few bags and te's got a few bags if I fall asleep preaching we're good mom too she's she's been a little frazzled but she came in yesterday and became the Florence night Andale of of nurses and she popped O pop up and fed him she was shoving him full of of ice and and popsicles and and uh what was that other stuff pudding he's laying it on him so he was eating and he got stronger so um they're going to take him and maybe put him in a step down room for some of you nurses that here know what a step down room is it's just taking him out of the ICU but the ICU was so full the step down room was so full they're having to it's just like inventory they're having to wait till two leave and bring two in and two leave and two in he should have been out of the IU maybe before that but there was two other people that was ahead of him that was in there that needed to go so he's going to go to a step down room and then we will then we will assess and the the doctors will assess forward but he is talking he was talking last night with Anna he would say a few things when we were there but he did eat he had not eat for 2 or three days so it was extremely weak and uh but just keep praying for him that's what we're that's what we're up against and um we know that um we have your support in prayer uh some of you have come and I don't think you can't I mean it's just you can't have a bunch of people in the room but Geor and Danny came the other night we sure appreciate that but we appreciate your prayers more than anything all right so just continue to remember remember dad excuse me remember the family also remember the family of Susan faush you know Sister n passed away when was it Monday Sunday and um and we respect their wishes and and they won't be a service anything we just just love Susan with with love and um and we give them all of our support so whatever she needs and whatever the family need will be there for him so we sure do appreciate you and that's kind of the update on Dad they've done all kind of MRI they did echo cardiogram on his heart they've done um EEG and really there's they're moving to another step as far as the the um diagnosis so so we're going to uh just trust in the Lord we believe in doctors we believe in medicine amen amen and believe that will help him get stronger but your prayers are more like I said before it's a it's a tug of war in that hospital demons and good Angels yes they are there that's right they are our sisters know that that when you walk in that place you know you you you think man brother Dale's in bad shape and then you look over to this other person that's not going to make it right so so we thank God that we're in the position that we're in all things are done to make us better right aren't we supposed to be made stronger from all this right Christians remember tragedy does not destroy a Christian it defines who they are they made it through this because of what their faith amen so let's stand to our feet let me make a few more announcements and then we'll get started Lord bless you like I said before if you need anything um just call us and we'll try to send out updates on what's happened different things to u to keep keep you updated brother Aaron will be speaking for us Wednesday night um coming up my lord it's October uh October 1st we'll have we'll have a regular service brother um what was his name

that in mind that's October we'll be announcing a little bit more like I said before uh like brother Ryan was talking about you know reading the Bible and and and and praying this makes you pray amen God might give you a tragedy to see how much you'll pray so we're praying amen we're praying for the Thomas family and uh Debbie and and Janet and and sister Audrey also and the ones that are that are affected by this passing we just got to realize he's in a better place we may miss him is separation but he's better now than he ever has been a doctor on this side cannot touch what he is on that side amen there's not a drug there's only one drug and that's called the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost he just put him over into another dimension and he's going to leave him there waiting for us to get ready to get out of here so let's um let's bow our heads oh good to have our brother with us brother Louise I can't remember his name what's Fran Fran brother Fran good to have you with us man I knew you was from Brother Martin's church I just didn't remember your name so I can hardly remember mine sometime so um yes yeah the first Sunday yes we'll have I'm sorry we'll have communion the first Sunday that'll be the first yes so we'll have regular service communion and foot washing on that thank you so very much I appreciate that and y'all pray for us this may be silly but we got to make communion wine and dad always made it so pray that we know what we're doing okay yeah don't be laughing it ain't a laughing thing when you buy $300 worth of of U grapes and you're hoping that you going to get some wine out of it all right so dad's always made the wine him and Mom and it's been really good and it's been made by holy hands and we didn't have to go out and buy it praise God I've been to many many churches where they have to go out and buy it they just lay hands on it and it's got all kind of stuff in it but we're fortunate enough here that dad's always made a communion wine we've never had to bite and U and we ask a prayer that we put enough sugar and we put enough this and that and the other in it to get it to ferment so that we can have Comm and I'm not I'm trying I'm not being silly I don't want to waste 100 pounds of grapes all right I want to give us some um some good communion wine to last us to the coming of the Lord amen so just remember that in prayer dear heavenly father thank you for this day you've give us we truly are a blessed people we can stand today with many things going on tragedies and sickness and and different things sister Freda being in the hospital Lord we pray that you'd touch her now Lord take that away from her what's got her in and father I pray that you'd be with that and the different ones the Thomas family Lord just be with us now as we come in here now and sit down as the family of Spoken Word Church and we listen Lord to what you have given us to speak to the people father we pray that you'd be with each one forgive us of our sins bless this day and continue to be with us Lord be with the bride around the world father brother Joel forny Lord different ones that we we've thought about Lord is called and ask about Dad Lord we pray that you'd touch them too because they're going through trials also Father just bless this day in Jesus name amen man I talked to brother juel and he couldn't hardly talk he's just so weak so let's just remember brother juel too excuse me he's going through a through a battle of his own all right so let's go this is Son of Man part 130 you'll load her up we'll get started in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the only begotten of the father I will make that bigger sorry about that we appreciate our young in the back don't we amen we appreciate them sure do but we're going to zoom this young in right here how that all right we good all right that was the scripture I was reading in Psalms we we believe that precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints Amen in the beginning was the word word was with God and Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth John 3:3 says Jesus answered and said verily verily I say unto thee except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God there is no way you can understand the kingdom of God because it's always contrary to man like we're supposed to Rejoice they cry we cry they Rejoice so it's just totally we're just you know why we're Kingdom people but not this Kingdom this world is not my home I'm just passing through brother brother how Thomas just passed through but thank God he influenced a lot of lives before he passed on through and the Lord knew that and that's why he got him here around us I believe God sends people in our midst to tell us that he loves us and he loves us through a group of people that loves each other that has a church family that is stronger than a than a than a natural family Revelations 19:6 and you can be seated and I heard it as were the voice of a great multitude and the voice of many Waters and the voice of Mighty thunderings saying Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife we're getting to wife brother Brown called us bride but we're heading toward a wife cuz when he was calling them bride they were not mature they were just babbling Pentecostal baby that did not understand what was going on Amen but it was for a mature group for that group that wasn't there brother Brown said it's not for you all right well this is for us this is a mature wife June we've been married 40 something years here coming up in a few weeks we know each other more now than we ever have she's my wife she was my bride at one time now she's my wife but remember we have a life together so we got to do as brother Ryan said our life together with our lovers should be read his word read his love letter talk to him all right and to her was granted that she should be ar raay and fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and thank God for me and you the promise to us is is we won't get that white robe over there you're wearing it right now if you're born again all right so you don't have to worry about going changing clothes no those white robes she should be arrayed and find linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints you may be seated 1 Peter 1:22 we'll we'll get to um a little bit of I I still want to continue on being born again because being born again is something you this very important but we have to make sure that we know as as brother um uh we were talking um several well last week with brother Andrew Glover about um and and you know he gets around and he preaches to many places and and he was in agreeance with me that that growth in the message is not really preached a lot it's just believe the message have a good time you know let the preacher get loud and let him start running and you start running and you start shouting and he starts shouting I'm telling you I'm sorry that's just it's just Pentecostal babies I'm not saying they're not born again I'm just saying there's not the growth has to be preached from the pull pit you cannot get growth without eating and you got to eat the right kind of food all right and the right kind of food is a five-fold Ministry folded up five times and given out to me and you from a pull pet through the foolishness of preaching and teaching which we have and have been but we still got to grow more we still got our mandate is to continue to grow that little caterpillar he just eats and eats you know why cuz the caterpillar can't fly right we need Eagles that can fly he's an Earthbound creature but there's something inside of him there's something inside of him that wants to fly all right I'll actually say Amen if you don't want to and hallelujah thank you buddy seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth look seeing you have Pur we're going to talk about that today we're going to pull your body apart how yucky is that kids we're going to pull your body apart Body Spirit and soul we're going to see how this statue of perfect man affects us in our life as a Christian because if you're not a Christian you're not going up to statute of perfect man all right if you're not born again you're not going up to Statue of perfect man if you're not born again you are dead right amen but we want to die amen kind of a paradox we want to die Paul tells us in a few minutes we'll look at the word mortify mortify comes into the the word mortician are to be stiff and to be dead all right seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit under unfeigned love of the Brethren all right how does that Channel Through the Brethren through the brotherly kindness as we were talking about see that you love another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed or corruptible word but of Incorruptible that's what happened and we'll talk about this down through the church ages I want you to understand the importance of the full word being back here today I said today current today this day 2023 September 24th all right being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God that's doing what he said which liveth and abideth forever and that word being is begot again be born again now not to be now listen I want you to understand that's why I'm we're going to pull this thing apart once you're born again in your soul you don't have to be reborn you are a born again believer but why would Paul say being born again why would he say you got to keep growing you got to keep going all right to produce again listen you are a child of the King today if you're born again you're in the family of God sealed signed and ready to go if something were to happen but God doesn't want you to stay a baby God didn't stay a baby in Jesus Christ he came to full maturity so he wants you to do the same thing you know why we'll look at this afternoon we got to get to that adoption part to where not only do you get a checkbook you get a checkbook when you're born again with Jesus's name signed on it you just sign what you need and hand it brother rown says hand it to the bank of heaven and they'll fulfill it but there'll come a time this is the time when God will give you a blank check Hallelujah and you sign it for whatever you need if you speak to this mountain don't wait on Jesus to sign it you sign it that ought to excite you but he won't give you that empty check blank check if you knows you're going to write it for something else that's why maturity that's why you got to come to the maturity of the word of God that you'll know how to use it when you can when you get it you'll know how to use that check book we know we can't outright checks we can't bankrupt Heaven All right but you can write a check that may not be the what God wants you to write it to but by maturity we know exactly adoption is the mind of God being in you so much to where your mind just goes away and praise God that's what I want all right I've got too much of my thinking going on Amen I hope you do too I hope you stinking thinking is what we always said get rid of your stinking thinking brother Brown said you must be born again 1961 and no matter how much we think try to think we're right in saying a Creed or joining a church you're still what you were until you're actually born again all right of the spirit of God it doesn't change you what those Creeds your Creeds joining church or just coming to the message or just saying I believe brother Ron was a Prophet come on somebody I've read 12 books and 12 tapes I got stars and I can read and I can do let's get born again first get down to the basic get back into this cuz listen the message doesn't birth you this births you brother brandom doesn't birth you Jesus Christ births you all right that's why I believe too we need to get back to the Bible and get down to the basis to where God is the one that's in control but if you ever get born again I'll promise you in the name of the Lord Jesus you'll come to this message and you'll have an understanding like you never had before but you can until you're born again that's right all right so that's the most important thing if brother Brown said that 60 years ago it's still important that you get born again and know that you are know that God's done something in your life and your walking even though you may be in sanctification but God's done something in your life as brother Ryan said it's not just we we don't believe in Alcoholics Anonymous it's a good program for somebody to go through but you know what they tell you once an alcoholic what always an alcoholic uhuh you get born again that won't happen again everybody with me because why because whatever that is is you in in AA you're just suppressing it amen we don't want to suppress something we want it dead and when it's dead it will never bother you again amen your Creed joining church or changing your ideas are your good intentions although as good as it might seem it's still not right there's something got to happen the new birth is an experience something that takes place so it's not to you bring it's not that that brings the new birth now the different churches that say well you accept this or believe that but it isn't same way with the message Believers all you got to do is believe the message no the devil believes the message he was right there where brother R spoke it acts 1 ver8 say but you shall receive power after after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you after you get the new birth is when your power or that dunamus is going to take over and yeah you going to have problems yeah that that old thing is going to still try to come back but remember the reason I did it is because it was part of me as brother Ryan said the read the pornography the smoking the drink whatever I mean your laundry list may not be his or mine all right but you all had a problem and it was seated in your soul your soul it was a very part of you you didn't have a problem doing it before God took a hold of you but when God got a hold of you he just took that whole one out the Bible says you shall be Witnesses what would be a witness if you meet them in the liquor store every three or four times a week you'd be a witness all right right so let's look at this to make the importance of this age and I want you to remember in the back of your mind what brother Brown said he said every age Got a Blessing and every age got a curse right or or a salutation uh you're doing good but but remember the last age read Revelations 3:14 there is no good for that age only that we ought to know where to buy the isab and where we need to buy all these different things but you and I are in the worst age that ever was and God knew that that's why he put you here that's why he put you here but Revelations 3:14 tells us that we have come to a place that we get all this plus it took a prophet to stand one day and say hey every blessing the church got from all seven Church ages is in this age and all the cursings that was in the all all the Ages come here cuz we'll read it this afternoon I didn't interject today maybe just one scripture the Bible says that I that God hates the Deeds of the nicians then the next scripture says the doctrine of the nicians in other words you and I today we have a Doctrine when you first come to the message you probably didn't see water baptism you probably didn't see one God that's right now don't tell me you saw it all at once come on but as we kept what washing by the right water amen we come to a realization of these great Mysteries amen right but there's some that won't there something that'll pass through and never get it I'm sorry but you and I are given all also all the power of those ages remember lonox man an eagle we're in the eagle age but the prophet of God said you and I would have all four of those which is the Holy Ghost In the End Time amen cuz just to make it through the day you have to have that option labor get me through Lord listen if I'm preaching to people that don't need that then we need all go to house okay all right so we are we are we are the ones that need the lion we need the boldness amen we need the ox we need the labor I'm got to get up tomorrow's Monday it hits old people too it's us worse we try to recharge on Saturday and Sunday and sometimes we don't plug in fast enough do we right she said right but we're still though we have a life to live and we have to go the lion the ox the man with listen you need intelligence too you need God's intelligence God's knowledge to defeat the Devil that's the only thing that's going to defeat the defeat the Devil you're not listen get me right you're not going to say oh I'm just going to pray every minute of every day that's not going to defeat the Devil one word of authority one word of authority beats years of praying one word of authority that's why we have to come to Authority in this age cuz what happened in the other ages look in Revelation 6:4 these horse riders we'll get into that when we get in the seals which will be up there in the Capstone that's why it's so important but God give them a power they a have one and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him a permitted power brother Dell preached on this many many years ago Satan has a permitted power God permits him to do things God permitted him to jump on job but he just didn't know he just thought he was going to destroy job but he made job stronger it makes us stronger to go through difficulties it makes us stronger to go through trials like I said before tragedy does not destroy a Christian if you get destroyed by a tragedy go back and get Christ amen get born again it'll give you a whole new perspective on your life now remember Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church now come into church not more barrooms more prostitutes more heathens more this the church right Satan's not worried about the world today he's worried about this church he doesn't want this church to grow he does he wants his church to fail but if he can't make you fail he'll make you lukewarm formal God bless you brother and Powerless everybody still believe brother R was a prophet well that was a quote from him right there so take it all right revelation of Jesus Christ this is in the 1960 the books the church age book Jesus Christ is God now talking about Revelation the Jehovah of the Old Testament Jesus of the new no matter how how excuse me how hard you try you can't prove the three Gods now there was a lot of you come up that you swore by three Gods you swore by trinitarian Doctrine you swore by all these things right which what brother Brown said that come from the pits of hell because anything contrary to God is the devil anything there is no uh there is no third person Hallelujah there's no third person it's either God or the devil all right that's your two Powers God has all of it he gives Satan part of it to do what drive us as the prophet said drive us to our homeland as he drove turn loose on six million Jews for the devil to send them back to their Homeland so thank God for the trials make this trial of blessing it'll put you on your knees can you really say that or you going to go set in the closet and go oh why is this happening the me weakling weakling but it also takes a revelation by the Holy Spirit to make you understand that you know we can by repetition we can say God's one God's one God's one there's only one God well the devil knows that the Bible says and trembles because of it I mean he's literally in front of God right now accusing us but right now the devil is not going hey I need to talk to Jesus hey father can I he knows that guy's want right he knows there's never been but one God but what does he turn around and do and filter through his stinking thinking he filters it to the Earth and fills this whole earth with a father son Holy Ghost baptism fills this whole earth with a trinitarian Doctrine that's right all except for just a little group of people tell you how shrewd he is that's how shrewd he is he knows for a fact there's only one God but he feeds you a trinity you know why because it God permitted that power for him to what deceive and see if you would accept that deception or take the truth of God as brother Ryan says listen we're all free moral agents you will be until the day you perish or the day we take a body change you will and are a free moral agent now listen if you're born again today in your soul you're not can I get one amen amen thank you all right in your soul that's either God or the devil now God is not a compromiser God doesn't lose God doesn't ever have a moment that he goes I don't know if I want to do that or not you see what you get at the new birth you get the very soul of God a piece of him doesn't just come in and get bes you I thought he burnt that old you out and put him in and then he molds with your character come on somebody he molds with that character you've got they'll give you the ability to teach the ability to pray I I don't pray a lot I'm sorry my dad will even agree with you with that cuz he's not he's not a prayer Warrior we pray as we walk through life just walking through life looking we we're praying all the time you don't have to get behind something get in front of something and get on your knees it would be nice cuz you know what you get a tragedy that's when you do hit your knees when it affects you all right amen it takes a revelation to see that Jehova of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new Satan crept into the church and blinded the people to this truth how did he blind the people weak pull pets he got in the preachers amen he got in the preachers and that the preacher then delivered that false Doctrine to the people and they eat it that's why they conquered the nicians is Conquering the Ley niik is conquer where did they conquer it from pull pit where did all FAL Doctrine comes from pull pit Satan crept into the church and blinded the people to this truth and when they were blinded to it it wasn't long until the Church of Rome stopped baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you want to make a Baptist mad cuz they hate Catholics I mean they really do they think the mother they're this they're that I mean they're pretty thank God we got somebody that just you know that's not Wishy wasi like a Methodist drove by the other day and um uh there was a preacher there at one of the Methodist churches on my route and it's a it's a color Church am so Randy Jones had been the pastor forever how long I've been there you know his name's on the thing Randy Jones that means he's a man well the other day they voted to be whatever that was with the other Methodist people and and now that name's gone and sister Mercy somebody I can't remember when I saw that word I thought no they did not but they did they elected a woman preacher so anyway but if you want to make a Baptist matad tell him there say look that baptism that you got Tom fush did the same thing I'm glad Tom was so big that people didn't really hurt that man if he'd have been a little bitty guy he'd got wept but he was so big and strong he' say your baptism come from the same place from hell yeah he said your baptism came from that Catholic Church that you say you hate you want make a Baptist mad you tell them that just be ready to Bob and weave cuz it'll make them mad it will make them literally mad but it's the truth that's where it all came from and it's of the devil all right so brother R said look in Resurrection West Palm Beach see I don't want to blame you people it's the pull pits that's where it started no wonder that's the damnation of the country when Satan got in the pull pit is the truth all right failing to preach the unadulterated word of God and the word of God will produce exactly what it said it would do listen stop for a minute that's why we need a prophet that's why we had to have somebody to restore the word back but we explain it all way it's all way it's for some other day it's for some other person I can't live this no you can't God's got to live it through you in the Masterpiece 1964 the prophet of God said notice this masterpiece when Satan got a hold of it the deceiver broke through the walls marred the Masterpiece listen there wasn't a crisis meeting in heaven God knew this was going to happen because that's the way he did it how'd he do it I'll go more into detail of it how do you do it the Masterpiece was walled by the word of God right Adam and Eve he's talking about and the Masterpiece itself of the family was fortified by this word I was thinking the other day I'll U um address it to you a little bit now you think about you take brother how for example he's passed on all right he's lived his life passed on but you know that was the time that God was standing in eternity he said I'm going to have how Thomas he's going to come on this Earth he's going to be XYZ going to have kids he knows all that and I'm going to take you home on September the 23rd not not a not a surprise to to anybody but maybe us all right but he's standing there and it's just the way I think he's standing there in eternity but he steps over and he gets into time with and and he starts into time with Adam and Eve he's like man they're going to do it they're they're going to they're going to bring the ones I want and he knew they wasn't but he was gracious anyway when he put them in flesh he knew they would fall so they fa now God didn't say now how in the world am I going to get H Thomas here no he said don't worry whatever it was 1937 or whatever year he was born he put two and two together and got him here you will not interrupt the plan of God Satan did not interrupt the plan of God how Thomas was coming to the Earth because God thought of it and he knew when he brought him here he would want the Holy Ghost and God would give him the Holy Ghost and then he would get him and cross pass with a prophet some may hate that but I hope he cross your path one day I hope God crossed your path one day and then he sent you across the path of a prophet the message of the hour God's word the word of God restoring not the word of God made different man has made it different the prophet of God came to restore the word restore the altar restore worship just as Elijah did but he brought brother the how here and he said okay I got him here he's going to make a choice this is what he's going to do now I'm going to take him home cuz his Journey's over and I'm going to put him back in the condition I saw him in before the foundation of the world take that with you today and don't worry about death amen brother Brown said remember went cross the curtain of time he said don't bother me no more why in the world would that bother me now amen to not have to go back to that he was talking about his body laying on the deteriorating brother Hal had had had his body had been deteriorating as as all our bodies are because of the curse of sin on the body part but that Soul inside of him is is twirling in a million miles a second see that's the Paradox you look at an older person you see ones that are that are getting weaker and different things but inside of them is a Dynamo Mo inside of them is an eternal person encapsulate that's why sin I was thinking about this yesterday sin that's how horrible sin is it will continue to make your body old wore out weak but inside of you if you're born again today you're 18 years old man I I was watching a football game yesterday and a guy got hit he flipped up in the air landed on his back jumped up run back in the Huddle I thought number one I wouldn't be out there but if I was I'd still be laying there but that's the curse of sin we've come to a place but inside of you though brother rman said he said it's that soul that God's dealing with the soul of you that's why then we we don't worry about the we're all falling apart amen talk about the world falling apart talk about your body falling apart but we as Christians realize though that every time that hurt happens there's something inside of you that says we're going home amen let me out somebody ever say that y'all let it out oh oh okay this masterpiece was walled by the word in other words God's word and the Masterpiece itself of the family was fortified by this word what husband and wife to bring forth his children but the broken part that was broke off of the original went out beyond that wall he's talking about Eve and he gives Satan a chance to Mar it now as you know what I believe he's talking about serpent seed but the great sculptor when he seen the fall of his family the Masterpiece he wasn't willing just to leave it lay there in other words he wasn't going to just stay there and go well wowy wowy woo I had all these kids I was going to have brother how Thomas and all you brother and sister sitting here with a new birth I ain't got no way to get you out now no he had to be a savior amen he had attributes of Redeemer healer your father become the son and living you with the Holy Ghost couldn't do that in that Eternal condition but he's bringing it back oh it ought to make you happy we ought not be sad we ought not be sad for nothing he wasn't willing that it would perish he went back to work to build it up again that's same way with the church listen he had a bride in the first church age and he told him immediately he said you've left your first love I'm going to have to divorce you because you took up these deeds and doctrines of the nicians that's why I'll read just in few minutes brother rown said there's been Brides brides churches Brides everybody with me amen he wasn't willing it should perish lay there all the time he's God he will not be defeated he went to work he said I'll put enmity I can see God he's standing there you know he's talking to Adam and Eve right come on somebody he's standing there talking to Adam and Eve in the garden he's getting ready to run him out of the garden he said hey don't worry I'm bringing you back right and whatever you got I'm going to restore back cuz I'm going to do it I'm God I'm going to be human flesh I'm going to be your savior I'm not going to depend on Adam anymore you're going to depend on me amen I love that that was a great promise as brother R said as the skins flapped on their legs as they walked out of the garden he said don't worry I'm going to fix this thing he will not be defeated he went to work immediately and began to build again in his own image a man which was Jesus Christ now he's building what another image his body the bride but he doesn't want a bride he wants a wife that's right or he would have said the Bride made herself ready he didn't he said the wife all right look pergan Church age how can you tell the spirits apart just give them the word test if they don't speak that word they are of the evil one excuse me as the evil one deceived the first two Brides he will try to deceive the Bride of this last day by trying to get her to what hybridize herself through Creeds or just plainly turn from the word to any sign that suits her we see that now but God never placed signs ahead of the word signs follow the word as when Elijah told a woman to bake him a cake first according to the word of the Lord when she did as the word said the proper sign came that's what we're looking at we're we got to get the word first we got to get the word right first come to the word first and then watch the miracle the seed word is energized by the spirit today as as the brothers have been speaking that we've had come they all kind of been one mind one Accord we need to be happy about this place right we need to be happy about the place we're in if you're not happy about the place you're in you need to be born again are we really excited about coming to church really you better ask yourself that question can't get some of you done Cross Your Hand listen I'm telling you you can have all kind of you can be built different but don't tell me that the word of God God don't energize you and make you at least say Amen every once in a while you ain't Born Again amen well you get quiet so you CU some of you do that how can any messenger sent from God believe only part of the word that's why I'm telling you how can we only believe part of well we believe brother Brown was a prophet brother Dale was our great teacher he he he did good brother W is just trying to do the best he can um he's bringing in these brothers trying to help us out a little bit and uh brother Aaron he he's good brother Bob he's good brother Louise he's good we got some good oh Lord Jesus Oh Lord you not be that way that's right brother cuz I as brother Andrew and I were talking the other day if you take what other people preach in these other churches excuse me it ain't all the truth and some of us that go out say Amen but I believe we have the truth I don't believe we have a truth and I'm bragging on God I'm not bragging on one person if you start bragging on people and then the Lord is saying no I'm number one amen all right same way with brother BR you put so much on brother brandom that's why I believe God had to take him home if brother brand would have stayed we'd everyone been Jeffersonville would have been the only church in the world right that's right but he didn't have that he had Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists to preach this message preach it right you say oh brother we can't keep it straight you better get somewhere else you can keep it straight if you got the Holy Ghost why can't the Holy Ghost keep his own word straight sure he will why you need somebody in the pull pet with the Holy Ghost brother R said backside the devil de backside the devil you're right backside of the desilt experience kick the devil in the backside amen you got to be happy if you're not happy about what you're in man find something find something makes you happy I swear please find something that makes you happy this makes me happy amen How can any messenger sent from God believe only a part of the word and deny some of it the true prophet of God in this last day will proclaim the whole word denominations will hate him his words may be as harsh as John the Baptist who called him vipers and snakes you think we're harsh every once in a while but the predestinated will hear look and be ready for the Rapture Ready For The Rapture all right I'm glad you got that Revelation thank you God bless you huh oh thank you sister Christine bless your heart the Royal Seed of Abraham that's us that are born again with like Faith as Abraham will hold to the word listen 40 years 50 years 20 years 30 years hold on for they are predestinated together the first seal brother rown was talking about he's talking about the church and he bring he keeps saying church he says church not to Christ but the church keeps saying church but then he stops he stops and he goes uh uh uh uh oh that makes me tremble what you know what I believe he got a revelation God said don't call them church anymore he said you call them my bride amen oh my that just makes me tremble I I hope that the church truly understands it see what I mean you people I'm going to call you bride that you'll understand so he has separated now the church from the bright as I've said many many times when brother brandham stood We Believe brother Bram was a prophet right amen all right he stood one day and he said these denominational churches are lodges amen right go to one you'll see a lodge Elk's Lodge nothing against the El's Club don't come riding on your motorcycles up here okay nothing against them but it's not a church brother B tells us Christ of mystery after all this and we'll get into it a little bit more this afternoon excuse me then we stand justified in the presence of God now what I'm going to take you to here in just a second is is now we know that the first church was a very powerful Church the first church didn't have a denomination in it first church age vers 2 three 2 three is before nah there waser a there waser a Baptist and a Methodist and the Pentecostal now there was ideas in different doctrines running around but they had the power of God in the lion l i o n the lion part of the Holy Ghost which was bold Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have he didn't have to reach in his pocket such as I have give I unto you rise up and walk all that got eroded though down through time man started going well that was for the apostles brother Brown many many times he he he reiterates that he say y'all think it was for some other age y'all think it was will you tell me when the apostolic age ceased he said but I can tell you when it began on the day of Pentecost so thank God he sent us a prophet to steer Us in the right direction then we stand justified in the presence of God so all that to come to a full maturity you can't come to full maturity with part work word all right as great as Paul was as great as irus and Martin different ones as great as they are they couldn't come to full word because they had a little bit of doctrinal issues pieces okay loose ends as brother R would call them but watch what he tells us here he says but we stand justified in the presence of God as a drop of ink dropping into a tub full of bleach you'll never find the stain of the ink no more it went somewhere amen it was now it's not that was me it'll never come back again you can't reverse the process everybody with me you take ink you take you take um Clorox you drop ink in it there's no other time that that ink is going to come back together and be ink again gone that's way your sins are that's way my sins are your sins are if we believe that that bleach blood of Jesus Christ will do it for us and when man is truly redeemed now look that doesn't mean that they were halfway but when truly redeemed that predestinated seed that sees it and accepts it his sins are demolished gone separated dropped in the ink of the blood of Jesus Christ God will never remember it again God forgets it and he you stand as a son and daughter of God in the presence of God Amen and amen now we are the sons of God not we will be we are now we are redeemed we have Satan's answer amen God has Vindicated himself God proves himself to his promise in this day amen hallelujah the headship is here what he's declaring the son of man Ministry is there which is what it's declaring that now you can become a wife right amen he separated ated the bride part y'all excuse me he separated the bride part he's got a church that used to be his bride he had to divorce them put them away now he has a bride but he doesn't want that bride to just I won't not do it if June was here we'd we'd come back and stand right here right and for 44 years we stood right here I wouldn't be able to wear my clothes and she wouldn't be able to wear her wedding gown I promise you and she's listening now so she slapped the car or something I don't know what she's done but wouldn't that be awful though I mean that was my w that was my bride we got married and we stayed at the altar never had kids never had a house we just stayed right here think about that he didn't want that he wanted us to say I do walk out the door and start a life and grow into a brid Grom and a bride then grow into husband and wife amen see to me that's Satan's answer sure we had problems listen you can't take all your life and say I'm proud of all this sorry let you just put in a box somewhere life's life but we believe life's lessons remember tragedies are for a purpose makes us stronger we have Satan's answer God has Vindicated himself God proves himself to his promise in this day who is that me and you Hallelujah the headship is here amen Christ the Risen Lord is here the same power of his resurrection that he ever was manifesting himself there's the devil's answer you can sit and talk to him all you want to but if you don't produce it if your life don't speak louder than your words Satan's just going to go I'm with you when they're not amen so here's my quote never since Jesus Christ was on this Earth has Satan had such a formidable opponent and let me add this that doesn't look very formidable to the world Amen but he's hiding his power in his wife amen that's right God's not a betting man but he's put everything he's got on this bride amen all the power all the promises everything he's got is right here on me and you you may not look out like a formidable opponent but you are oh I get beat and I get so you know what that's what Jesus has been looking for amen when he was standing on the earth in John 17 he said Lord I pray that they may be one like me and you are one I've read you that a hundred times to me that's the bride's prayer because what he said he said Lord don't take them out of the world but protect them right amen all right don't take them out of the world we're going to live in the world you tomorrow call me at lunch tomorrow and say this is the best Monday I ever had in my life about a third of you might and that would be the ones that don't work on Monday but the rest of us that's going to have to work tomorrow yeah okay but he didn't promise to take us out of the world but he promised to help us handle it every adversity we're supposed to turn death into life we're supposed to turn death a trag Y into what a party Lord have mercy we parted in the world and we can't in party when we're born again you just got to learn how to party I don't like that well sorry it's like brother Jo fory said he said buddy he said now he said when I was growing up course now he was growing up in the 80s and he was carried a gun in places he shouldn't have carried a gun did a lot he's told his testimony but he said oh he said he said now they was always that that black and white you know always that you know I'm black and white you that separation he said but old brother he said let me and that white guy get drunk he said we slobber on each other we hanging on to each other we saying we love you we go together go somewhere together he said said you ever get drunk on the Holy Ghost he said you'll love your brother it doesn't matter what color it is if you can love him and party out there why can't we love him and party in here oh wait a [Applause] minute bust loose one of these days let me read this and then we'll close I Ain got to where I wanted to get to when you try to put the Holy Ghost it's rising of the sun 1965 when you try to P put the holy spirit in a denomination you're as much as you get a sputter you'll ruin your engine by getting it full of carbon but oh I'm so glad there's a 10,000 octane power the word of God and a holy ghost to light it up amen all right the word is dead laying right here it has no life at all that's got to come off inside of you then the Holy Ghost can have help help you look and say oh that's Meen and to resurrect the power of God into a man's life or a woman's life or into a church that shoved that Cadillac down the road Yonder under the dynamic dynamic power of the Holy Ghost now he's talking about I would say he's talking about the first church and all the different things the Dynamo but then all of a sudden what happened start sputtering bring some man's ideas in right that was the first sheath come up from all the prophets which is the Son of God the king of all prophets there's been churches churches Brides brides churches Brides brides but there's got to come one Hallelujah you can say me if you want to our brother did there has to come a real bride now not that the other ones were false they just had false ideas in them right all right there has to come a real bride there must come one that not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it makes that church live move in the power of his resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to give it a facelift or those of you that don't know what Simoniz job is that's wax there was a company called Simoniz it was called Simoniz wax right then there's no Dynamics in it no matter how much mechanics proves to be right there's got to be Dynamics to make it work Revelations 19:6 for heard as it were the voice of great multitude and the voice of many Waters the voice of Mighty thunderings you I was thinking the other day it doesn't just Thunder by itself it'll help you understand the Thunders if you'll understand what I'm fixing to tell you something had to happen to make it thunder amen there had to be some lightning before there's a thunder all right the Thunder is an afterthought of what's already happen remember you see the lightning then they always say count how many seconds and if you count th1 th2 and if it boom boom boom that means it was two miles away it struck two miles away cuz it took that much time for that sound to get to your ear we'll talk about that a little bit later on cuz we got to get into Thunders when we get up here in the cap voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready to her was granted that he she should be ar raid and find linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints let's read this real quick and then we'll close the comforter 1961 there'd be drugs in drugstore but there's got to be a doctor to diagnose the case if he didn't he might kill you right so therefore you've got to have a diagnosis of the case you just can't go and take a sinner and give him the Holy Ghost he's got to repent first he's got to be washed baptized the name of the Lord Jesus Christ his sins away he's got to be prepared for this great vitamin that's going to be given him now we have a sacred trust you know what that trust is we have an inheritance a Heritage that we inherit as believing children it's a sacred trust and that sacred trust and our sacred Heritage is the word of God what that's been given to us then he says the full word of God the word itself is the vitamin the word itself God's word that that's there musicians come on that's where reason I'm so dogmatic we had a preacher there was real dogmatic brother Dale was real dogmatic it was a word or nothing I would call it on standing on this word no matter what anything else says if it's not with a word I don't believe it see if you want to believe it that's all right but to me it takes the word cuz heaven and earth will pass away but my words shall never fail therefore it takes that word let me read this real quick and this is where we'll start this afternoon we haven't really touched the token much and and I want to I want to just interject something real quick let's stand our feet there was a Doctrine many years ago that that um there was no giving of the Holy Ghost because of this quote because brother R said the true token only comes in the end time all right so there was a doctrine that there was no Holy Ghost given it's called No Holy Ghost Doctrine Bob Lambert dad knew him brother Mike Canada knew him but he said you didn't get the Holy Ghost it was just an anointing you didn't get the Holy Ghost and it really fit with you know what their belief was of the Holy Spirit up here where brother B says you've come all this way you ain't got the Holy Ghost yet but listen folks the token is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it was given on the day of Pentecost how dumb was that for us to believe that it wasn't the Bible says if Pentecost the Holy Ghost fell on them you see what I mean man's ideas will supersede the word every time man's ideas will supersede the word every time but it will not conquer the word cuz there was a group of people that didn't believe that told the White Eagle to go back to wherever he was Ohio wherever was he called himself the White Eagle sorry he wasn't no White Eagle to me the Holy Ghost came on the day of Pentecost the trueu now what brother random is talking about what's he talking about the fullness the Holy Ghost can only work with what word you've got right right and if you still got a father son Holy Ghost baptism the Holy Ghost can never anoint that that's right he can't anoint he cannot anoint false doctrin he cannot he hates it we'll reading this afternoon he said I hate the Deeds of the nicians I hate the doctrine of the nickan yeah God hates he hates anything contrary to the word of God and we can display the token of the Holy Spirit shows that we have been accepted in Christ and that is our token that all we have need of is already purchased by him all right so there's your quote you get everything that's in your birth down here you get five toes on one you get five hands on one hand you get a two eyes you get a nose two right but can you drive a car you can't drive a car at 3 years old 5 years old some of you can't drive at 16 amen what you laughing about but you're still a human but you got to grow same way in God we got to grow how many times we that's the whole thing is growth it's growth in God shows that we have been accepted in Christ and that is our token that all we have need of is already purchased by him all right we are identified with our token the token must be ready the blood Covenant blood is not recognized without the token what was the token the blood that was applied to the lentil of the of the of the U door that the death angel would come and he'd see that blood and he'd go away he'd see that blood and he' go away but if he didn't see that blood guess what he went right under the door and took the first porn death in the camp without the token the word assures us of the promise the token is is the sign that the purchase has been made for us full obedience full obedience to the full word of God entitles us to what the token of the end time the body change the getting out of here the Rapture no other way is there that you could ever be entitled to the Token until you fully obey the word of God now what somebody has put into it added to it not what that somebody's put into it or added to it but what God said about it when he said you must be born again that don't mean jump up and down at the altar that don't mean walk back there and Shake somebody's hand with a pastor that don't mean all this foolishness that we've seen done it won't mean putting your name on a church book it means death to yourself first and life to the second being Hallelujah it means that the blood has been applied and you're identified by the life of Jesus Christ and if he be the vine we be the branches the life that's in the branch is also from the vine it'll bear the fruit when we go and pick those um grapes and all that different stuff it's going to come from a grape vine it will bear the fruit are you ready to bear fruit Hallelujah let's sing a song God bless you didn't get where I want to go but we'll get there this afternoon if you have a need oh heavenly father I appreciate you sing it to me I love you adore you I bow down before you heavenly father I appreciate sing it to the

got to let him live out from what's inside has he ever said I'm pleased to dwell that you know what you think of all the things that we have all the just think of everything in your life but when God said that day he said when he gave you the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said I am pleased and comfortable to dwell in that person in your soul but he wants you to continue to grow he wants you to be comfortable in your memory and your reasoning your conscience he wants you to be comfortable with the knowledge that you have and the temperance and the patience if you're not comfortable with it just
