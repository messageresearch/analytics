[37:53] brother the way for the invitation being
[37:55] here and uh the opportunity to uh to
[37:59] bring the word of God and um I express
[38:02] this not out of humility just simply
[38:04] because it it's a reality to me I'm
[38:06] nothing in myself and and I know that
[38:09] you will hear things that you've heard
[38:10] before and quite frankly I don't know of
[38:13] anything else to bring but what I've
[38:14] heard before but what we already know to
[38:17] be the truth and the Bible tells us that
[38:20] we are to be stirred up by way of
[38:22] remembrance to be stirred up because
[38:24] sometimes I know y'all cute folk are
[38:26] here every where I go there's cute folk
[38:28] that think they you
[38:30] know they're better than somebody else
[38:32] but I'll talk to you
[38:34] too but we get
[38:37] complacent Things become common to us oh
[38:40] I've heard that before you know and and
[38:42] I think about this many times we we will
[38:45] give the devil more opportunity to
[38:48] convince us of things he tell us one
[38:51] time one time and we'll go to the bank
[38:55] with it but we hear sermon after Ser
[38:57] message after message and it doesn't
[38:59] sink in what's what's wrong with that
[39:01] what's up with that we're just human
[39:04] we're on our way to Perfection we will
[39:06] get there one day right amen but I want
[39:09] to thank brother Wade for the
[39:10] opportunity to be here and just want to
[39:12] thank brother Andre and the and the
[39:14] Saints there and just love you all and
[39:16] known brother Andre for years and and uh

[39:39] to go anywhere you folk from Georgia
[39:41] where you
[39:42] going y'all are where you came to be so
[39:45] we'll just have a good time and you'll
[39:46] listen to this old guy talk a little bit
[39:48] just to get rid of my nerves and just
[39:49] set these things aside but but um but it
[39:53] it is it is a joy to to just know the
[39:55] Lord and and to just make friends along
[39:58] the way and when you find out that
[39:59] someone that you meet for the first time
[40:02] you find out that they're family and
[40:04] it's just that way because you know here
[40:06] we are and what's been designated as a
[40:09] youth service and so many times I think
[40:11] about a youth service and and and
[40:13] brother Wade I can't help but to to
[40:15] Really uh I guess position a youth
[40:18] service in in that this way that it's
[40:21] really a service preparing us for the
[40:23] Youth
[40:24] service so whoever the oldest person is
[40:27] in here tonight this service is for you
[40:30] because we are on our way to that place
[40:32] of Eternal youth amen so sis if you're

[42:07] congregation in the sides of the north I
[42:10] will Ascend above the heights of the
[42:12] clouds I will be like the most high God
[42:14] this is a little bold
[42:17] character verse 15 yet Thou shalt be
[42:20] brought down to Hell to the sides of the
[42:24] pit amen
[42:27] they that see thee shall narrowly look
[42:30] upon thee and consider thee saying you
[42:33] mean to tell me this is that one that
[42:36] caused me all that trouble you mean to
[42:38] tell me this is the one that I listen to
[42:41] more than I listen to God
[42:46] himself narrowly look upon thee and
[42:48] consider thee saying is this the man
[42:51] that made the Earth to tremble that did
[42:54] Shake
[42:55] kingdoms that made the world as a
[42:58] Wilderness and destroy the cities
[43:00] thereof that open not the house of his
[43:04] prisoners his objective is to trap you
[43:07] and keep you and not let you
[43:10] out being a prisoner in your mind alone
[43:13] in your room
[43:15] somewhere that is his objective is to
[43:18] keep you locked up and not let you
[43:21] out not open the house of his prisoners
[43:25] all the kings of the nation ations even
[43:28] all of them lie in glory every one of
[43:30] them in his own house let us pray
[43:33] Heavenly Father
[43:35] we thank you Lord for your word and as
[43:39] I've said Lord our
[43:41] identification who we are is in this
[43:44] word Lord I want to to learn everything
[43:48] that I can about who I
[43:50] am and I can do that by learning who you
[43:53] are because who you are is who I am
[43:57] lord it's not a tangle of syntax in that
[43:59] we say these things it's simply a
[44:03] reality and so many times we have to
[44:05] give expression to that reality in a way
[44:07] that may be a little curious to some
[44:09] around us and they may not quite
[44:12] understand it but Lord you you you you
[44:15] are pulsating your desire towards your
[44:19] people today tonight in this service and
[44:22] father no doubt there's some sitting
[44:23] here tonight listening to me that's come
[44:26] to this Place Lord they don't know you
[44:28] in a true and a genuine way we just pray
[44:32] tonight that you would just stir Hearts
[44:34] forgive us of our our Humanity oh God
[44:38] and help us to set ourselves aside help
[44:41] us to set this old flesh aside Lord that
[44:44] we can lay hold on to something of
[44:46] Eternal value because we know that this
[44:49] old world is about done as our sister
[44:52] was singing the the saints were singing
[44:54] that song Oh God to being reminded the
[44:57] the signs of the time they're
[44:59] everywhere they're all around us even
[45:03] even the carnal man even the worldly man
[45:05] even the worldly woman sees and feels
[45:07] that something is not right something's
[45:11] off but Lord the reality is something is
[45:14] about to come on and it's called a
[45:17] Rapture so Lord may we lay hold on to
[45:20] those things tonight oh God change us
[45:23] and help us as we walk through this word
[45:25] tonight oh God may it be an
[45:26] encouragement to the people may we be
[45:28] benefited by our gathering tonight and
[45:30] it's in the name of Jesus Christ we pray
[45:33] amen amen you may be
[45:42] seated but Isaiah gives us some insight
[45:46] into the intent and the purpose of the
[45:49] Devil
[45:51] Himself but a beautiful thing about this
[45:54] this this scripture
[45:57] my thought is that not only does he give
[46:01] us insight into uh the devil he allows
[46:04] us to see exactly what's going to happen
[46:06] to
[46:07] him and we are dealing with a defeated
[46:10] foe he's already it's already
[46:13] done everything that's going to happen
[46:15] has already been done we as mortal
[46:18] beings have to to um capture the essence
[46:21] of God I'll just say it this way we have
[46:24] to capture the essence of God for us as
[46:26] in
[46:28] individuals we we can't so much look at
[46:30] how Mama did it how how daddy does it or
[46:33] or we can't really look at how the
[46:35] pastor does it in the sense of their
[46:37] walk with the Lord we have to capture
[46:40] the inspiration of God what he's
[46:42] pulsating to us as an individual because
[46:45] see the thing is that preacher he may
[46:48] fall by the wayside Mama may say pack up
[46:51] and say I don't want to live this life
[46:53] anymore so you the individual it's
[46:56] important that we lay hold on to God but
[46:58] I as as I have just the the time tonight
[47:01] I just want to take a thought dethroning
[47:03] a
[47:05] king dethroning a king we all know what
[47:09] kings are and of course we live here in
[47:11] America we're Democratic Society we
[47:13] don't have the monarchy and all of that
[47:14] and and in in many places uh around the
[47:17] world the monarchy is really just a a
[47:19] figurehead it's it just a status thing
[47:21] there's no real power it's just
[47:23] something that's been in place for years
[47:25] and people will keep it around and don't
[47:27] we do that in our own lives well it's
[47:29] just comfortable that's what I've gotten
[47:31] used to and my daddy was or my my mama
[47:34] was and you know all of these things and
[47:36] that's what they did that's how they did
[47:38] it but dethroning
[47:41] King and I have to to to give a little
[47:44] bit of caveat here in that the Lord puts
[47:47] me in situations sometimes this little
[47:49] thought it's been rumbling around in my
[47:51] head but I I've never really until just
[47:53] yesterday even it just I was just
[47:55] praying about the service and I had a
[47:56] thought that I'd been working on
[47:58] studying and and the Lord just shifted
[47:59] my thought and and so if this seems
[48:01] jumbled it
[48:04] is but I believe it's what God wants us
[48:06] to hear tonight so I just want to do my
[48:08] best to submit to that inspiration and
[48:10] and and just be able to bring it because
[48:12] I I I I want you to know that that that
[48:15] the pulsation of who I am and what I do
[48:18] in Christ is is I use two scriptures
[48:21] that that give me uh energy and that
[48:24] being the the the woman at the well and
[48:28] the prodigal son because I believe
[48:31] firmly that there are people just as it
[48:34] was with the woman at the well as she
[48:36] did not realize who she really was but
[48:39] yet she was religious and here she was
[48:42] telling the prophet God him the God
[48:44] Jesus himself talking to this man
[48:47] telling him what the word says and hear
[48:49] the word he was the word so she was
[48:51] religious and she knew but she did not
[48:54] know who she was because there was no
[48:58] light to cross her path so a pulsation
[49:01] from within me or or a purpose with that
[49:03] that I try to fulfill is to be a little
[49:06] Illuminator wherever I go to shed light
[49:09] because somebody may not know who they
[49:10] are and the prodigal son is such that
[49:13] there are people that are are have had
[49:16] an experience with home I'll say it that
[49:19] way they've had an experience with home
[49:21] but they've they've they've had a desire
[49:23] to go out and sew their oats and do all
[49:26] these other things things because that's
[49:27] in all of
[49:29] us because we're we're Fallen creatures
[49:32] but yet there has to come a time for
[49:35] that prodigal to realize it's okay to
[49:38] come back home in fact Daddy has been
[49:41] watching and waiting for you to come
[49:43] back home so as I go and do what I do in
[49:47] Christ I'm looking for the
[49:50] prodigal and I'm searching for an
[49:53] opportunity to talk to a woman at the
[49:55] well
[49:58] and it may not look like you do it in
[50:00] fact with Jesus himself they wonder what
[50:02] in the world is he doing talking to this
[50:04] type of
[50:06] woman not just that he's talking to a
[50:08] woman he's talking to that type of woman
[50:11] because sometimes God will put I don't
[50:13] know why I'm saying all this sometimes
[50:14] God will put people in your path they
[50:16] may not look like you they may not smell
[50:18] like you would like them to smell they
[50:20] may act in a way that you may not be
[50:22] comfortable with but if we would submit
[50:25] ourself to love yes and reach out to
[50:28] these people because I'm wanting to get
[50:31] out of
[50:32] here we're not going anywhere till that
[50:35] last one is in and as a prophet talked
[50:38] about if if there's only one in
[50:40] Jeffersonville that's going it's going
[50:41] to be
[50:42] me he had that type of faith and that
[50:45] type of belief so I just borrowed that
[50:47] inspiration of of what he said there and
[50:49] and and I I look at it this way if that
[50:52] last seed is going to be found I'm going
[50:55] to find that last seed
[50:57] because I'm ready to get out of this
[50:59] this old pest
[51:01] house but dethroning a king to remove
[51:06] from the throne dethroning to remove
[51:09] from a prominent or powerful position to
[51:13] deprive of any High position or title to
[51:17] depose or to take away the power and
[51:21] authority of we're talking about
[51:23] dethroning a king we're talking about
[51:26] taking away the power and authority of a
[51:30] power or a source that has so captivated
[51:33] a
[51:34] life that they can't progress further
[51:37] they can't make any headways in in God
[51:40] they come to church after service after
[51:42] service and they hang around Church
[51:43] events but there's just something that
[51:45] won't allow them to move on in there's a
[51:48] king on the throne of their
[51:50] life I'm here tonight to let you know
[51:53] it's time to Dethrone that King
[51:57] Dethrone that King so what what what
[52:00] made a person how did kingship begin and
[52:05] there's so much we could get into and
[52:06] and I don't really have have a lot of
[52:08] time but but but how did kingship begin
[52:11] it it it was never in the the nature of
[52:14] God to to have one man to rule over
[52:17] another
[52:18] right man has done that so how did this
[52:22] kingship thing begin and and what made a
[52:25] person so important were so great that
[52:28] that that they positioned themselves
[52:29] above everyone else and it gave them an
[52:32] elevated
[52:34] position what started that where did
[52:37] that come from because all things had to
[52:39] have a beginning or a
[52:42] Genesis and and one as I was looking at
[52:45] some of this I I found this this little
[52:47] comical uh answer to that question how
[52:49] did kingship begin and this one guy says
[52:52] it this way if you own the farm you own
[52:54] the food which is something everyone
[52:56] needs to survive so that makes you
[52:59] King I'm the big man around here huh I
[53:04] know people like
[53:05] that I just want to take a little bit
[53:07] time let's listen to this this is just
[53:08] one person's uh uh uh uh explanation of
[53:13] of kingship and King Kingdom hood and
[53:16] how it came to be they said essentially
[53:18] just just give me just a moment here
[53:19] there are various models of schools of
[53:22] thought regarding the emergence of
[53:23] leadership class or or or kingship for
[53:26] instance in hydraulic civilizations
[53:29] meaning ones dependent on irrigated
[53:32] agriculture it is assumed that the
[53:35] leadership class were the people who
[53:37] planned the irrigation systems that were
[53:39] vital to everyone's
[53:40] survival as time went on and these
[53:43] cities prospers the leaders begin to
[53:46] assume listen to this the leaders began
[53:48] to assume mystical or mythical qualities
[53:52] which transformed them into priests and
[53:55] eventually God Kings of those
[54:00] societies it's because they had the
[54:02] ability to to keep the people
[54:05] alive you see it so many times in the
[54:09] church these men will build these little
[54:11] kingdoms up and they'll have the people
[54:12] rallying around them if you go away from
[54:17] church and do all of this God's going
[54:20] to where's the Holy
[54:24] Ghost where's the Holy Ghost
[54:27] not that this is why there is a
[54:29] prevalence of Thrones uh having mythical
[54:32] ancestry ancestry which seems to be the
[54:34] Common Thread among all these different
[54:36] civilization me models pharaohs for
[54:39] instance claim to trace their ancestry
[54:42] to Horus an actual God in the Egyptian
[54:45] Pantheon the Greeks have polus uh by
[54:49] which they identified and they insist on
[54:52] having mythological ancestors Athens
[54:55] being named after literal goddess too
[54:57] even modern Thrones tend to have this
[55:00] mythical origin with the Throne of
[55:02] England being mythically entwined with
[55:05] King
[55:06] Arthur so there's a mysticism there's
[55:09] something something strange and odd
[55:11] about this whole kingship and this
[55:13] rulership thing today of course we scoff
[55:15] at such claims but the fact is that
[55:17] kingly Thrones were often entwined with
[55:19] mythology to confer a sense of divine
[55:22] legitimacy to the monarchs so they
[55:25] themselves couldn't fully uh show their
[55:28] legitimacy so they had to tie some
[55:30] deification to it they had to make
[55:33] something uh mythical about it to get to
[55:36] capture the attention of the people and
[55:38] to keep them under their domain and
[55:40] rather Kings emerged from the fusion of
[55:42] leadership classes and a common
[55:44] mythology which effectively created a
[55:47] paradigm that the entire Society Society
[55:51] can agree on as their
[55:54] reality so in instead of finding their
[55:57] own reality they look to this King to be
[56:00] their reality the Pharaoh doesn't just
[56:02] leave because he plans all the
[56:04] infrastructure projects and has an army
[56:06] to kill any Rebels he's the leader
[56:09] listen to this he's the leader because
[56:11] people actually believe he is descended
[56:14] from the gods and to disobey him is to
[56:16] subvert the will of the
[56:19] gods they believe that he was
[56:23] God you tell me what's falling around
[56:25] this mess message thinking that William
[56:27] bradam was
[56:30] God it's
[56:32] mythology it's a kingdom that's not of
[56:37] God y'all just pack that and take it
[56:39] home with you I ain't going to dissect
[56:41] that one I'm just letting you know I
[56:42] don't believe in that
[56:44] nonsense and that's what it is nonsense
[56:48] so as I as I began looking at at this uh
[56:51] history of kingship again studying just
[56:54] traing through some some some things I
[56:57] found it fascinating how uh even for
[57:00] instance like with the Egyptians in
[57:02] particular when when their power
[57:05] structure would collapse time and time
[57:07] and time
[57:09] again there was something about this
[57:11] concept of kingship of divine kingship
[57:15] that was so strongly entwined and
[57:18] ingrained in their societal and cultural
[57:21] DNA so much so that even after it would
[57:25] topple and fall
[57:26] that generation after generation as time
[57:29] went on they would strive so
[57:32] intentionally to go back to that old
[57:35] order and eventually it would be
[57:39] reestablished and as we were looking in
[57:42] our opening
[57:43] scriptures we find out in verse Isaiah
[57:45] 14:13 says for thou has said in thine
[57:48] heart I will Ascend into heaven I will
[57:51] exalt my Throne so this whole idea and
[57:54] this whole construct of kingship is a
[57:57] demonic
[58:00] construct it comes from the pits of hell
[58:04] so any man that wants to take rulership
[58:06] in the sense of holding the people under
[58:08] his rule his
[58:10] domain he's under a demon
[58:15] Spirit as I said you take this and you
[58:18] packing and take it home with you do
[58:19] whatever you want to with it but if when
[58:21] you look at it for what it truly is
[58:23] people are functioning under a kingship
[58:26] that's that the intention is to take
[58:28] them and make them a prisoner and not
[58:31] allow them to get
[58:35] out it's a demonic
[58:37] construct Luke 10:18 says and he said
[58:40] unto them I beheld Satan as Lightning
[58:43] fallen from Heaven the disciples the 10
[58:45] disciples that come running back saying
[58:47] praise God we had a Victorious campaign
[58:49] we have all these Devils subject under
[58:51] us Jesus wait wait wait a minute wait a
[58:55] minute
[58:57] Your Glory should be in the fact that
[58:59] you are called that you are in that
[59:02] number that you are truly genuinely his
[59:05] not the fact that you got demons subject
[59:07] unto
[59:10] you from the very beginning it was
[59:14] Satan's ambition and desire to be like
[59:18] God in fact he wanted to be even more
[59:21] than
[59:23] God cuz what did he begin to say I I
[59:26] will I'll do this I'll do that this is
[59:29] what I will
[59:30] do and he was at one time the original
[59:34] Archangel of God think about it he once
[59:39] held the greatest position in heaven
[59:41] outside of
[59:42] God he was God's rightand man to
[59:45] Fellowship so if God was going to
[59:47] fellowship and and talk about some
[59:49] things who is he going to talk
[59:52] to so if he was that close to God then
[59:55] he knew C certain things that nobody
[59:57] else
[59:58] knew huh he was God's rightand man to
[1:00:02] Fellowship that's what the prophet says
[1:00:04] and verse 13 look at it it says that in
[1:00:08] his heart for thou H has said in thine
[1:00:11] heart he didn't even speak these things
[1:00:13] out it was something on the inside that
[1:00:15] he had a secret
[1:00:18] desire and no doubt some you sitting
[1:00:20] here looking at me now and you when I
[1:00:22] mention these kingdoms that are holding
[1:00:24] you captive this king that's holding you
[1:00:27] it's stying your growth you probably
[1:00:29] thought of whatever it was and you begin
[1:00:32] to to maybe your wife doesn't know maybe
[1:00:34] your your husband does maybe Mom and Dad
[1:00:36] don't know but there's something that's
[1:00:38] holding you back from fully coming into
[1:00:41] your position in Christ Church it's time
[1:00:43] to get out of
[1:00:45] here when that last one comes in when
[1:00:48] that last one is in maybe they've been
[1:00:51] sitting on a Pew for 10 20 40 50 years
[1:00:55] many times sometimes we think that that
[1:00:57] last one is somewhere across the sea we
[1:00:59] got to go across the sea no they could
[1:01:00] be your neighbor that's right next door
[1:01:02] to
[1:01:05] you
[1:01:07] dethroning King but in his heart so he
[1:01:12] got puffed up in his heart he was the
[1:01:15] one that wanted to worship he saw all
[1:01:18] this worship going to God he wanted the
[1:01:20] worship he wanted the recognition he
[1:01:22] wanted the power he wanted the authority
[1:01:26] amen it's a demonic construct somebody
[1:01:30] that's waned to be the top of everything
[1:01:32] it's a demon
[1:01:35] Spirit he simply did not have the
[1:01:38] character to match the Fulfillment of
[1:01:41] that
[1:01:42] ambition that's why it's important for
[1:01:44] us to stay in the calling and position
[1:01:46] wherever God is calling whatever he's
[1:01:48] calling us to do let's be that let's do
[1:01:50] that with all that's within
[1:01:53] us you know I can't be brother Andre I
[1:01:56] can't be brother
[1:01:57] Wade if I were brother Wade then you'd
[1:02:00] hear Brother Wade again you'd hear
[1:02:01] Brother Andre again I want to be who God
[1:02:03] has called me to
[1:02:05] be and as I so often have said one of
[1:02:08] the biggest diseases that that's running
[1:02:10] ramit within the church is called
[1:02:12] comparative itis we want to compare
[1:02:15] ourselves to somebody else who is it
[1:02:17] that you really want to be like
[1:02:22] anyway I hope you don't want to be like
[1:02:24] me
[1:02:25] I ain't got nothing for you but Jesus
[1:02:28] Christ that's the best thing that I can
[1:02:31] give to you that I can show so if you
[1:02:32] want to be me then stand up here and you
[1:02:35] Proclaim Jesus Christ you beat Jesus
[1:02:38] Christ so he simply did not have the
[1:02:41] character to match that ambition that's
[1:02:42] why Powers the prophet says apart from
[1:02:45] character is
[1:02:47] satanic power apart from character is
[1:02:50] satanic and we must remember that
[1:02:52] character is a
[1:02:54] victory a character is something that
[1:02:57] that that that that we time after time
[1:02:59] we get victory over it's not something
[1:03:03] that we have that we're just giving we
[1:03:04] have to work toward
[1:03:06] that 1959 questions and answers so
[1:03:09] listen to this so Lucifer is on Earth
[1:03:15] today we think you know he ain't going
[1:03:17] to bother me bless God I believe Malachi
[1:03:19] 4 praise the
[1:03:22] Lord what are you going to do with
[1:03:24] Malachi 4
[1:03:26] if that's how you feel that you've got
[1:03:28] Malachi 4 then why do you cow down every
[1:03:31] time the Devil comes your way and you
[1:03:33] won't do what God is leading and telling
[1:03:35] you to
[1:03:37] do bless God I've got Malachi 4 I'm the
[1:03:40] messenger of the hour well live it be
[1:03:47] it so he goes on to say so Lucifer is on
[1:03:50] us today trying watch what he's doing
[1:03:52] trying to work in the church to
[1:03:55] accomplish the same purpose that he
[1:03:57] started before the foundation of the
[1:04:00] world Lucifer was kicked out of
[1:04:04] heaven so if Lucifer was kicked out of
[1:04:07] heaven what ought we to be doing with
[1:04:10] Lucifer when he comes knock it on our
[1:04:13] door if he can't stay in heaven he can't
[1:04:16] stay in
[1:04:18] here if he can't have a home in heaven
[1:04:21] he cannot have a home in
[1:04:23] here he cannot have a home home in my
[1:04:26] life so what are you going to do with
[1:04:29] this King what are you going to do with
[1:04:31] this Kingdom that has established itself
[1:04:34] in your
[1:04:36] life it's time to Dethrone that
[1:04:39] King it's time to kick him out sir so
[1:04:44] somehow somehow he positioned himself
[1:04:48] between the angels and
[1:04:51] God how how did he get such a position
[1:04:55] how was he able to uh
[1:04:58] uh position himself in that
[1:05:02] place and the prophet says it this way
[1:05:05] and ascended himself above those
[1:05:08] stars and watch what he did and he
[1:05:11] preached to them and deceived 2/3 of
[1:05:15] them so he positioned himself between
[1:05:19] the angels that he got between the
[1:05:21] angels and God what did he do he began
[1:05:24] to elevate himself
[1:05:27] huh because after all the Angels knew
[1:05:29] hey this is God's buddy this is God's
[1:05:32] right hand man so what he's saying
[1:05:33] probably has some truth to
[1:05:36] it
[1:05:37] huh that's that's subtle church that's
[1:05:42] SLE pre Preachers will take a gift a
[1:05:44] genuine gift and twist the words that
[1:05:48] they say to influence the people in such
[1:05:50] a
[1:05:51] way that it's causing them to oh my
[1:05:54] goodness
[1:05:56] it's a demonic construct it's the Devil
[1:05:58] Himself standing in the bullpit many
[1:06:04] times and he preached to them and
[1:06:06] deceived 2/3 of them he took 2/3 of
[1:06:10] God's
[1:06:12] congregation now that's more than half
[1:06:14] is it
[1:06:17] not so what was wrong what what happened
[1:06:20] he had some
[1:06:22] influence and he was so effective
[1:06:26] and what he was
[1:06:28] doing he caused 2third of the angels to
[1:06:31] follow his Doctrine he did the same
[1:06:34] thing to
[1:06:36] Eve so what did he do he obstructed
[1:06:39] Eve's
[1:06:41] view he got between Eve and her
[1:06:45] word so he was he was obstructing what
[1:06:50] she was able to
[1:06:51] see which God had already told her
[1:06:54] you're to look at me
[1:06:56] you to keep your eyes on me that man I
[1:06:59] put in your life you to look at
[1:07:05] him obstructing the view of Eve and he
[1:07:09] saw what God was doing and said within
[1:07:11] his heart again I want
[1:07:17] that that's what I
[1:07:19] want I want a heaven that's what he was
[1:07:22] saying in his heart I want an Eden
[1:07:26] I want a wife I want an
[1:07:29] eve and he's got
[1:07:31] him but he ain't got
[1:07:35] me he ain't got
[1:07:38] you because even tonight you're learning
[1:07:41] and hearing about it's time for me to
[1:07:44] Dethrone that
[1:07:46] keing let it
[1:07:49] go I don't care what Daddy
[1:07:52] did I don't care what that brother did I
[1:07:54] don't care what that Uncle did
[1:07:56] amen those scars people are walking
[1:07:58] around traumatized with scars things
[1:08:01] that happen in their life and the devil
[1:08:03] will take them back time and time and
[1:08:05] time again he's wanting to imprison you
[1:08:08] in that
[1:08:11] condition letting you think well I can
[1:08:13] never get away from that don't care what
[1:08:16] you did you confess it cuz listen to
[1:08:19] this confess sin no longer belongs to
[1:08:23] you once you confess BL it it's not
[1:08:26] yours
[1:08:28] anymore and therefore when when when you
[1:08:30] go to bringing it up to God God
[1:08:32] says what's that you're saying I I don't
[1:08:35] understand what you're saying I don't
[1:08:37] even remember
[1:08:38] that so if he don't why should
[1:08:42] I God says what in the world are you
[1:08:44] talking
[1:08:46] about remember that confessed sin
[1:08:49] doesn't belong to you
[1:08:51] anymore but he was saying I want a
[1:08:53] heaven I want an Eden I want a wife I
[1:08:55] want want an eve why because he's
[1:08:57] wanting to establish dominance and
[1:09:00] position himself as
[1:09:03] king I can do it better than God can so
[1:09:07] what did he do he attacked the mind the
[1:09:10] intellect of Eve we're familiar with the
[1:09:12] message the greatest battle ever I'll
[1:09:14] read some quotes from that message here
[1:09:15] in a moment but he attacked the mind of
[1:09:18] Eve and that's where he attacks us the
[1:09:21] most is in our
[1:09:23] minds when we get alone and nobody's
[1:09:26] there he'll begin to to to to Buffet at
[1:09:28] those things so he brought some
[1:09:31] intellectual Enlightenment to
[1:09:34] Eve if he could get the mind he had
[1:09:37] Direct access to her
[1:09:41] heart listen to me young
[1:09:44] ladies some little young I know he's
[1:09:49] fine he smells good
[1:09:57] but if that little Shyer don't have the
[1:09:59] Holy
[1:10:02] Ghost you better leave him
[1:10:05] alone listen to me young men if she
[1:10:08] don't have the Holy Ghost you better
[1:10:10] leave her alone I don't care how long
[1:10:13] her hair is it's got those little curls
[1:10:15] at the end
[1:10:16] they all the boys are talking about it
[1:10:20] sir you know but if she don't have the
[1:10:22] Holy Ghost you better
[1:10:24] run the prophet talked about a wild
[1:10:26] stare old cow get a wild stare something
[1:10:30] wrong with that that something wrong
[1:10:31] with
[1:10:33] it you better run while I'm here while
[1:10:36] that's up I had that to happen years ago
[1:10:39] I was single y'all I single but I
[1:10:42] experienced that very thing and of
[1:10:45] course I was saved single and
[1:10:49] searching but I I was I I won't tell
[1:10:52] where I was or anything but I was at
[1:10:53] some meetings and and and and some of
[1:10:55] buddies that were with me they they were
[1:10:58] uh uh they they knew that you know this
[1:11:00] this sister they were say well you need
[1:11:01] to get get her number and all all this
[1:11:03] stuff you know how y'all know how it
[1:11:04] goes don't look at me like you know what
[1:11:06] I'm talking
[1:11:08] about so we were at a restaurant after
[1:11:11] the service and she uh had got up to go
[1:11:13] get something out of the car or
[1:11:14] something and and and they were perect
[1:11:17] time so I get up you know and go out and
[1:11:19] you know I think I'll just walk her out
[1:11:20] or whatever and and and but when we got
[1:11:22] to the doors to to leave there were two
[1:11:25] set it's like you walk out of the door
[1:11:26] then there's a little for you then the
[1:11:27] door out to the outside and and so you
[1:11:30] know being a gentleman listen guys being
[1:11:32] a gentleman that shivy still
[1:11:34] exists I open the door for her and and
[1:11:38] and and went through the forer and open
[1:11:39] the other door and she steps out and and
[1:11:41] as she goes out she turns back and we're
[1:11:43] just talking I don't remember what we
[1:11:44] were talking about but when she turned
[1:11:46] and looked at me I heard those words
[1:11:49] that wild
[1:11:54] St now you either believe the message or
[1:11:57] you don't you either follow the message
[1:11:59] or you don't even these little simple
[1:12:02] you get way off up there in the lofty
[1:12:04] all these great deep Mysteries but these
[1:12:07] little simple things will save you from
[1:12:09] a world and life of
[1:12:11] hell I did nothing more but excuse
[1:12:14] myself and I went back into the
[1:12:16] restaurant never talked to her again
[1:12:19] nice sis
[1:12:22] wonderful but Brothers you got to watch
[1:12:24] that sis
[1:12:25] she she does not have the Holy Ghost I
[1:12:27] cannot stress that
[1:12:29] enough they have to have
[1:12:33] it if he could get to the mind he had
[1:12:35] Direct access to her
[1:12:37] heart and if he has her heart she can
[1:12:40] easily be swayed by every wind or
[1:12:45] doctrine every little thing you know
[1:12:47] getting captivated by his words oh he's
[1:12:49] so cute and he smells so
[1:12:53] good and when when when when when a
[1:12:56] person is in that
[1:12:58] state when a person is is in a position
[1:13:01] to where they can so easily be sway by
[1:13:03] love of course it's always love always
[1:13:07] love then they will no longer put up a
[1:13:10] fight they'll no longer remember what
[1:13:12] Daddy had told them to do or not to do
[1:13:15] they'll no longer remember what mom had
[1:13:17] told them to do or not to do or let me
[1:13:19] bring it on up to the older folk they'll
[1:13:21] no longer do what the pastor had told
[1:13:23] them to do they'll no longer do what
[1:13:25] what the word has told them to
[1:13:27] do because theyve Fallen Captive to this
[1:13:30] scene they no longer put up a fight why
[1:13:33] because Eve was saved why why you know
[1:13:36] he'll take care of me he'll look after
[1:13:39] me she had confidence in that because he
[1:13:43] had gotten between her he had obstructed
[1:13:45] her
[1:13:46] view and he appealed to the
[1:13:51] intellect greatest B ever thought well
[1:13:53] that's the way it is friend Satan tries
[1:13:55] to be hypocritical about it he tries to
[1:13:58] show you something better an easier way
[1:14:01] a more sensible plan but there is no
[1:14:03] more sensible plan than that God laid
[1:14:06] down at the
[1:14:11] beginning his word hold that word get a
[1:14:15] grip on it let it get a grip on
[1:14:18] you so if you got a grip on it and it
[1:14:21] has a grip on you then you all are
[1:14:23] united
[1:14:25] and even when you get weak and you begin
[1:14:27] to slip he's got a grip on you that will
[1:14:29] not let
[1:14:31] go he will never let go of you stay
[1:14:35] there with it that's the that's the
[1:14:37] thing the battle rageed when Eve open up
[1:14:39] her mind to listen to her
[1:14:43] reasonings huh that's the flu it come in
[1:14:46] that's the channel that run down her
[1:14:48] reasoning she in her soul she reasoned
[1:14:51] her eyes with sight she saw the serpent
[1:14:56] see taste feel smell hear these are
[1:14:59] Avenues which we' have been given to
[1:15:01] contact this
[1:15:03] realm and the devil operates in this
[1:15:06] realm so anytime things are appealing to
[1:15:09] those senses you can probably guarantee
[1:15:12] it and go to the bank on it that it's
[1:15:14] the devil trying to influence you in
[1:15:15] some
[1:15:16] way her eyes was Psy she saw the serpent
[1:15:20] he was beautiful handsome far better
[1:15:22] than her own husband
[1:15:26] what he was the most subtle of all the
[1:15:29] beasts of the field and he was probably
[1:15:31] a fairer man than her
[1:15:36] husband huh he was he looked like a
[1:15:40] great masculine Beast standing there how
[1:15:42] great he was and he was trying to tell
[1:15:44] her what a great thing it was and the
[1:15:46] first thing she did she opened up her
[1:15:50] mind and what she did human reasonings
[1:15:54] caught it
[1:15:56] human reasonings caught it there is no
[1:15:58] reasoning in reasonings in God God says
[1:16:02] it that settles it that's it there's no
[1:16:04] there's no there's no reason there there
[1:16:07] there's there's no time or there's no uh
[1:16:09] uh uh opportunity that we should take to
[1:16:11] try to reason God's word am it simply is
[1:16:15] what it is and what does she say why
[1:16:19] wouldn't that be a
[1:16:23] thrill that's that's the thing he does
[1:16:25] to a woman today some woman with a
[1:16:27] lovely little husband finds some great
[1:16:29] big masculine man that'll try to opening
[1:16:31] up her reasons remember that Satan
[1:16:35] that's the devil or vice versa man to
[1:16:37] woman woman to man either way what does
[1:16:39] he do he works in the reasoning power
[1:16:42] that conscience where something begins
[1:16:44] to move through but God gives word the
[1:16:47] first
[1:16:48] place so if God gives the word the first
[1:16:51] place then that's what I want to give
[1:16:53] first place to is the word of God young
[1:16:55] people young men young women give God's
[1:16:58] word the first
[1:17:00] place give yourself the time and the
[1:17:03] space and the opportunity to grow and
[1:17:05] find out who you are in God before you
[1:17:08] try to attach and pull some little girl
[1:17:10] in your life you ain't got no job you
[1:17:12] won't take a
[1:17:14] bath you won't clean your
[1:17:20] room and then you expect some little
[1:17:22] girl to follow you in into matrimony
[1:17:26] uh-uh
[1:17:28] uh-uh I ain't got nothing to do with
[1:17:30] your business but you better hope I
[1:17:31] don't see something like that I'm going
[1:17:33] to call you out on
[1:17:36] it and then I'll take it up with your
[1:17:38] daddy and mama if they have a problem
[1:17:39] with me cuz this is the word of
[1:17:45] God it's what it is a man can't a man
[1:17:49] can't even come he can't sin Hallelujah
[1:17:52] here it is watch this he says this is
[1:17:54] coming threesh FR this is coming fresh a
[1:17:57] man cannot sin until first he cast aside
[1:18:00] God's
[1:18:03] word so there's something already built
[1:18:06] within the structure of of humans of of
[1:18:09] humanity that we cannot sin until we
[1:18:12] cast God's word aside so even though we
[1:18:15] don't confess the Lord even though we
[1:18:17] don't live a Christian mind that
[1:18:18] individual still has to cast God's word
[1:18:21] aside before they can
[1:18:23] sin he can't even sin that's disbelief
[1:18:26] until first he gets rid of the word of
[1:18:28] God the presence of God he cannot sin
[1:18:31] Eve could not sin until she laid aside
[1:18:33] God's word opening up her channel of
[1:18:35] reasons to her soul and begin to
[1:18:40] reason so that channel to the soul
[1:18:43] that's supposed to be the channel
[1:18:45] through which God contacts the
[1:18:48] individual that's God's Channel that's
[1:18:50] God's betting ground but what does human
[1:18:53] reasoning do it opens up that channel
[1:18:55] for the devil to come into the very soul
[1:18:58] of
[1:19:00] man she goes on to say reason to and
[1:19:02] begin to reason why certainly my
[1:19:04] husband's never told me these things but
[1:19:06] I believe that you he told me I
[1:19:08] shouldn't do this but you know you make
[1:19:10] it so
[1:19:13] real make it so real it's it's you're
[1:19:16] making it plain to me see there there
[1:19:19] was the first
[1:19:21] battle human reasonings
[1:19:25] these kingdoms it's time to Dethrone
[1:19:27] this
[1:19:29] King it's time to topple his throne it's
[1:19:32] time to take the rulership and
[1:19:34] jurisdiction that he has in your life
[1:19:36] dictating how you get up how you go down
[1:19:39] what you do it's time to Dethrone this
[1:19:45] King that was the first battle and
[1:19:48] through that battle has caused every
[1:19:50] other war and every other Bloodshed that
[1:19:52] ever come was caused right there at Eden
[1:19:55] she disbelieved God's
[1:19:57] [Music]
[1:19:58] word that first Eve did what she did but
[1:20:02] this second Eve she's been called to
[1:20:04] stand in the power of who she
[1:20:08] is through the message of her
[1:20:12] day the time that we're living first 2
[1:20:15] Corinthians 10:4 says for the weapons of
[1:20:17] our Warfare are not carnal they're not
[1:20:22] reasonings the weapons of our Warfare
[1:20:24] are are not carnal But Mighty through
[1:20:27] God to the pulling down of strongholds
[1:20:30] so they're Mighty they're made possible
[1:20:32] how through
[1:20:35] God not through what you con see not
[1:20:38] through what you can think of but the
[1:20:41] they're Mighty through God that's what
[1:20:42] that word mighty means is made possible
[1:20:44] through God to the pulling down to the
[1:20:47] destruction to the demolition of
[1:20:51] strongholds to the destruction to the
[1:20:53] demolition of the these Kingdoms in our
[1:20:56] lives that's preventing us from moving
[1:20:58] on with
[1:21:00] God dethroning a
[1:21:03] king casting down imaginations little
[1:21:07] Eve you got to cast down
[1:21:10] imaginations thank you Lord and every
[1:21:13] High thing that exalted itself above the
[1:21:15] knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:21:17] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[1:21:20] of
[1:21:21] Christ 10 and6 says and having in a
[1:21:24] Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience
[1:21:27] when your obedience is fulfilled in
[1:21:30] verse 5 that word imagination means a
[1:21:33] reckoning a
[1:21:35] computation a
[1:21:38] reasoning imaginations a reasoning such
[1:21:41] as is hostile to the Christian
[1:21:45] faith the reasonings that the devil
[1:21:48] brings are hostile to your walk in
[1:21:52] Christ right
[1:21:55] so we got to cast down all these
[1:21:58] things and having inner Readiness to
[1:22:01] Revenge all Disobedience that word
[1:22:03] Readiness means ready or
[1:22:06] prepared that word Revenge means to
[1:22:08] vindicate one's
[1:22:11] right I've got a right to live this life
[1:22:14] in Christ I've got a right to look the
[1:22:16] devil in the face and say no not today
[1:22:22] devil huh I don't I don't care where
[1:22:24] you've been I don't care what you've
[1:22:26] done I don't care I don't care what your
[1:22:28] life is I'm here to Proclaim to you
[1:22:30] there is a life better and greater than
[1:22:33] the one that you're living now because
[1:22:35] the one that you're living now the devil
[1:22:37] has you so bound and so
[1:22:40] trapped and even when you come to church
[1:22:42] you I better not raise my hand they know
[1:22:43] what I've done it doesn't matter what
[1:22:45] you've
[1:22:46] done what's important is what you will
[1:22:48] do and that's to surrender to that new
[1:22:51] king that he's knocking he's standing
[1:22:54] there and he's bidding he's wanting to
[1:22:56] get in he's wanting to take control of
[1:22:58] your
[1:23:01] lives that song many years ago Jesus
[1:23:04] Take the Wheel in fact I don't want to
[1:23:06] just take the wheel take my whole car
[1:23:08] take
[1:23:08] everything take it
[1:23:10] all because if I'm in the car and you
[1:23:13] got the wheel something may happen I may
[1:23:14] try to get the control of the wheel back
[1:23:16] again you just take the whole
[1:23:18] [Music]
[1:23:19] car so I guess that girl whoever she was
[1:23:22] she needs to write that song again Jesus
[1:23:25] car take the bus if if you got a bus if
[1:23:28] you got a RV worth of of living than
[1:23:31] Jesus Take It All take full
[1:23:37] control having in a Readiness to Revenge
[1:23:40] all Disobedience when your obedience
[1:23:43] when your obedience is fulfilled when
[1:23:46] your obedience is fulfilled when it
[1:23:48] becomes compliant and
[1:23:50] submission submitted and compliant to
[1:23:53] what brother yes when your obedience is
[1:23:56] fulfilled that obedience and compliance
[1:23:59] to
[1:24:00] Christ that obedience and and and
[1:24:03] compliance to the anointed
[1:24:05] one is that right because listen youve
[1:24:08] served the devil long enough you've done
[1:24:10] long enough what the devil's told you to
[1:24:12] do you've tried everything why don't you
[1:24:15] try
[1:24:16] Jesus I'm not talking about the Jesus
[1:24:18] that you're used to seeing and the Jesus
[1:24:20] that you've conceived in your mind and
[1:24:22] the Jesus that you that you that you so
[1:24:25] quantify when you come to church or when
[1:24:27] you see Christian people you say well I
[1:24:29] don't want to be that I'm not talking
[1:24:30] about that I'm talking about Christ the
[1:24:32] anointed
[1:24:34] word that's who you want to
[1:24:38] become so when that you you you
[1:24:41] submitted to Christ the word and you're
[1:24:43] submitted to his anointed purpose for
[1:24:45] your
[1:24:46] life not your neighbor's life that's
[1:24:50] fine let them do what they're doing what
[1:24:52] God has called them to do I'm talking
[1:24:53] about you submitting to what God wants
[1:24:55] you to
[1:24:57] do how about that his word and his
[1:25:01] people doing the very things he did when
[1:25:04] he was here on the
[1:25:06] earth so incidentally the the the the
[1:25:10] Life of Christ has not ceased to be in
[1:25:14] in in fruition upon the face of the
[1:25:17] Earth why because there are people that
[1:25:19] are submitted to that very same purpose
[1:25:21] and they're doing the same things that
[1:25:23] he diden
[1:25:25] you say me brother Joy yes you well you
[1:25:27] don't know what I did I don't care what
[1:25:29] you did I've already we've already gone
[1:25:30] through that it doesn't matter what you
[1:25:32] did because today tonight today is the
[1:25:35] day of salvation choose you this day
[1:25:38] whom you will
[1:25:40] serve now there's going to be somebody
[1:25:42] that's going to walk out these doors and
[1:25:44] they are going to continue to allow that
[1:25:46] King to be in their lives but I'm here
[1:25:49] to Proclaim to you today you will not be
[1:25:51] without a witness that you have the
[1:25:54] opportunity to know that there is
[1:25:56] another king there is another
[1:25:59] ruler there is another Power there is
[1:26:01] another Force that's greater than that
[1:26:04] which is controlling you now brothers
[1:26:06] and sisters submit to that word that
[1:26:08] anointed
[1:26:10] word serve that
[1:26:13] purpose you're
[1:26:16] miserable you're
[1:26:19] lonely even though you're surrounded by
[1:26:21] people you're lonely because you you
[1:26:24] you're not doing what God is calling you
[1:26:26] to do oh
[1:26:29] God dethroning a
[1:26:31] king his word and his people doing the
[1:26:34] very things that he did when he was here
[1:26:37] F the prophet says it this way f i f a i
[1:26:40] t h in the word of God faith in the word
[1:26:44] of God and that is an atomic
[1:26:48] bomb you want to annihilate hell drop an
[1:26:52] atomic bomb of faith in in the word of
[1:26:54] God into your situation into your
[1:27:00] circumstance still the same message
[1:27:02] greatest battle ever fought let's not
[1:27:03] use a 22
[1:27:07] rifle don't use a 22 a 22 is good for
[1:27:10] from squirrel picking at your
[1:27:15] neighbors no don't do that get the cops
[1:27:18] call on you let's not use a 22 rifle the
[1:27:23] prophet says let's get an atomic
[1:27:26] bomb so you tell me how do you go from a
[1:27:28] 22 to an atomic there's some other stuff
[1:27:31] in between the 22 in the atomic bomb
[1:27:33] that could be used but no we're talking
[1:27:35] about annihilating the Devil
[1:27:40] Himself let's get an atomic bomb he says
[1:27:43] let's do the job right how many wants to
[1:27:47] do the job right then drop that atomic
[1:27:50] bomb on the devil let let's get God's
[1:27:52] atomic bomb what is it brother
[1:27:54] f a i t h in his
[1:27:59] word not so much even what the preacher
[1:28:01] says but faith in the word of
[1:28:04] God because I or some other preachers we
[1:28:07] may say it wrong or not intentionally
[1:28:09] but we may say it wrong and it bring a
[1:28:12] little bit of question mark But if you
[1:28:13] get faith in this word that's the atomic
[1:28:16] bomb that we need to drop on the devil
[1:28:19] that's God's atomic bomb and it blows
[1:28:21] sickness and Devil's right and left
[1:28:25] so we look around our lives and we see
[1:28:27] pieces of the devil all around
[1:28:30] us pieces of who he wants
[1:28:33] was and it blows sickness in Devils left
[1:28:36] and right it annihilates them
[1:28:38] discriminates oh it's just destroys it
[1:28:41] disintegrates everything that's
[1:28:44] ungodly when that bomb of Faith drops in
[1:28:47] there with the word of God behind it it
[1:28:49] blows every devil every sickness every
[1:28:51] disease
[1:28:55] so we need to take this survey as we're
[1:28:56] up here flying around in the the heights
[1:28:59] of this the mysteries of this message of
[1:29:00] the hour here we are in our big plane
[1:29:03] and we see that devil in our life we see
[1:29:05] that devil in our home we see that devil
[1:29:07] in our in our minds all we got to do is
[1:29:09] as we're flying over we just press that
[1:29:10] button and drop that
[1:29:14] bomb there goes another
[1:29:19] devil drop an atomic bomb it
[1:29:22] disintegrates every
[1:29:25] everything all the scars all the wounds
[1:29:28] all the bad words all the things that
[1:29:30] we've done it a disintegrates all of it
[1:29:33] and God says what are you talking
[1:29:36] about I don't know what you're talking
[1:29:38] about because you confess that sin it no
[1:29:41] longer belongs to
[1:29:43] you so take it out of your
[1:29:47] vocabulary don't use that as an
[1:29:49] opportunity for people to feel sorry for
[1:29:52] you it's brother Je 20 says Wy Wy
[1:29:57] W it's time to set those situations
[1:30:01] aside we're about to take a Rapture
[1:30:04] Church we've got to stand up in our
[1:30:06] position as a song says stand in your
[1:30:09] position and watch the miraculous come
[1:30:12] into
[1:30:13] action because our God is
[1:30:17] tremendous he goes through the fire just
[1:30:20] to save a
[1:30:22] sinner amen dropping an atomic bomb the
[1:30:25] message of token full obedience to the
[1:30:28] whole word of God entitles you to the
[1:30:31] token and nothing
[1:30:34] else blessed is he that does all of his
[1:30:37] Commandments he might have a right to
[1:30:39] the Tree of Life Isaiah 59:16 says and
[1:30:42] he saw that there was no man and
[1:30:45] wondered that there was no
[1:30:47] intercessor therefore his arm brought
[1:30:49] salvation unto him and his righteousness
[1:30:52] it sustained him verse 174 he put on
[1:30:57] righteousness as a breastplate now we're
[1:30:59] talking about dethroning a king and he's
[1:31:01] not going to give up rulership of that
[1:31:03] land just say well you believe the
[1:31:05] message of the hour and well you quoted
[1:31:08] the mount 4 you quoted this scripture
[1:31:10] well here you go he going to give it up
[1:31:12] just like that so you better go in
[1:31:15] prepare to
[1:31:18] fight because he himself knows the power
[1:31:21] that lays within this world right he
[1:31:24] knows the the ability that this word has
[1:31:27] to transform and change a
[1:31:29] life he's not going to give up that
[1:31:32] territory just simply because you said
[1:31:35] just because you asked for he put on
[1:31:36] righteousness as a breastplate and en
[1:31:38] helmet of salvation upon his head and he
[1:31:40] put on the garments of Vengeance for
[1:31:42] clothing and was clad with Zeal as a
[1:31:45] cloak according to their deeds
[1:31:46] accordingly he will repay Fury to his
[1:31:49] adversaries recompense to his enemies to
[1:31:51] the islands he will repay recompense
[1:31:53] don't have time to get in all these but
[1:31:55] verse 1959 Isaiah but so shall they fear
[1:31:58] the name of the Lord from the West and
[1:31:59] his glory from the rising of the sun
[1:32:01] when the enemy shall come in like a
[1:32:04] flood and he's coming in like a flood in
[1:32:08] fact he's already been in your life like
[1:32:11] a
[1:32:12] flood but the word of God says when he
[1:32:15] comes in like a flood the spirit of God
[1:32:17] shall lift up a standard against him you
[1:32:21] are no match for the devil you have to
[1:32:23] have something greater than what you've
[1:32:25] been using to De on this keing I know
[1:32:29] you've tried time and time again you
[1:32:31] goone to Al you moved you cried you sned
[1:32:33] over the altar but today is the day that
[1:32:36] you can Dethrone that
[1:32:38] K you don't have to leave here Bound by
[1:32:41] that
[1:32:45] situation you say well I don't want to
[1:32:47] act like my wife I don't want to do what
[1:32:49] my husband does you don't have to do
[1:32:50] that God's not calling you to act like
[1:32:52] your wife God's not calling calling you
[1:32:54] to act like your your mama God's calling
[1:32:57] you to act like
[1:32:58] you we're not here to
[1:33:02] impersonate huh we're not here to
[1:33:04] compare ourselves with somebody
[1:33:06] else so simply it gets to the point that
[1:33:10] the individual becomes fed up sick of
[1:33:14] the conditions surrounding their
[1:33:16] existence simply get fed up with the the
[1:33:19] same old thing that these things
[1:33:21] governing your lives it's time to take
[1:33:26] action it's time to do something
[1:33:29] about young people if Mom and Daddy
[1:33:31] ain't acting right at home I say this a
[1:33:33] lot I'm going I'm going to to commission
[1:33:37] you to get down on your knees in in your
[1:33:40] quiet time and you go to praying you go
[1:33:43] to talking to the Lord to change the
[1:33:46] situation of your home if Daddy don't
[1:33:48] want to do it you do it if mama ain't
[1:33:50] about it you be the one that's about it
[1:33:56] my
[1:33:58] goodness that individual finally gets to
[1:34:01] the point they says no more will this
[1:34:04] Tyrant King rule over my
[1:34:07] life today's the day it's settled I'm
[1:34:10] dropping a bomb on that
[1:34:14] situation not just any bomb but an
[1:34:16] atomic bomb that annihilates
[1:34:20] everything no Trace Moses's Commission
[1:34:23] now friends it doesn't take excitement
[1:34:26] it takes true settled
[1:34:30] Faith now I believe in Emotion I'm an
[1:34:33] emotional person I believe in shouting
[1:34:35] speaking in tongues dancing all those
[1:34:37] things but it's not
[1:34:39] that huh because what happens if if like
[1:34:42] the the Pentecostal people believe that
[1:34:44] the initial evidence is speaking in
[1:34:45] tongue what happens if something happens
[1:34:48] to you have an accident and your tongue
[1:34:49] gets cut out there goes your Holy Ghost
[1:34:54] if you believe the evidence of having
[1:34:55] the Holy Ghost I shout not you should
[1:34:57] have saw me I was Dan what happens you
[1:34:59] get an accident and you lose the ability
[1:35:01] to use you use your legs there goes your
[1:35:04] Holy Ghost it's something greater than
[1:35:07] that God doesn't work under excitement
[1:35:10] watch this God doesn't work under
[1:35:12] excitement or Screaming or stomping or
[1:35:14] running you can't Stomp The Devil to
[1:35:17] make him go
[1:35:20] out you've got to know right where your
[1:35:23] understanding and Order him
[1:35:28] out this right here you
[1:35:31] speak devil you got to
[1:35:37] go order him out isn't that right the
[1:35:40] power of God see that's what it is
[1:35:43] baal's prophets cut themselves and they
[1:35:45] jumped upon the altars and they screamed
[1:35:47] oh baale oh B and Elijah said the god of
[1:35:50] Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be
[1:35:53] known this day that I'm your
[1:35:55] Ser he didn't scream he didn't shout he
[1:35:57] didn't jump he simply spoke the
[1:36:02] word he simply manifested through word
[1:36:06] the message of his
[1:36:09] day
[1:36:11] huh and Elijah said the Lord God of
[1:36:13] Abraham Isaac and of Israel let me know
[1:36:14] this day that I'm your servant and watch
[1:36:16] what happens and fire began to
[1:36:20] fall isn't that right it's the authority
[1:36:23] of knowing not guessing but
[1:36:27] knowing the lamb and the dove 1957 and
[1:36:30] now I'm sure that in this we have found
[1:36:32] lots of
[1:36:34] impersonations and and impersonation
[1:36:36] friend I a person that would impersonate
[1:36:38] something is the most miserable person
[1:36:40] that I would know
[1:36:45] of well maybe if I can just hold my
[1:36:47] hands just right you know maybe I can
[1:36:49] just do this when I go up to the Altar
[1:36:51] and I kneel down I'll do it this way
[1:36:53] that's
[1:36:54] impersonator and you're miserable at the
[1:36:57] altar
[1:36:59] miserable not repentant but
[1:37:05] miserable is it isn't it much better
[1:37:07] just to be yourself the prophet asking
[1:37:09] question as Congressman Upshaw used to
[1:37:12] say don't try to be nothing that you
[1:37:14] ain't well that's pretty good don't try
[1:37:16] to be nothing that you are not just be
[1:37:17] yourself and then if you want to be a
[1:37:20] Christian just ask Christ he will take
[1:37:22] your old neighbor nature out and put a
[1:37:25] new nature
[1:37:27] in then you don't have to impersonate
[1:37:30] anything so what is he doing he's taking
[1:37:32] that Old King and he's becoming the new
[1:37:35] king he's taking the old dominating
[1:37:38] Force out and giving you a new
[1:37:41] dominating
[1:37:43] force not impersonating in it's just
[1:37:45] your normal life that will living your
[1:37:49] normal life that you're living not your
[1:37:51] neighbor's normal life they have their
[1:37:53] life that's normal to them God wants you
[1:37:55] to live your normal life because
[1:37:57] ultimately Saints Satan was trying to
[1:38:01] impersonate
[1:38:02] God and what the prophet saying a person
[1:38:05] that impersonates is a miserable
[1:38:07] creature the devil think about it he was
[1:38:09] a miserable
[1:38:11] being because that's ultimately what he
[1:38:13] was wanting to do he was wanting to
[1:38:15] personate God and here we are here we
[1:38:17] are think about this here he was
[1:38:19] impersonating and he was wanting uh to
[1:38:22] to impersonate God he was wanting to
[1:38:24] become something that he he wasn't able
[1:38:26] to become and here we are in
[1:38:29] 2024 and we are becoming and are the
[1:38:33] very thing that the devil
[1:38:36] desired did you catch what I just
[1:38:39] said here the devil was in heaven
[1:38:42] Desiring something that he could not be
[1:38:45] and we are that very thing right here
[1:38:48] today that the Devil Himself was
[1:38:51] Desiring so why should I settle for
[1:38:54] something that he's telling me that I
[1:38:58] am when I have all of
[1:39:01] eternity to shine and glow and show
[1:39:04] forth that this is
[1:39:06] me I am Malachi
[1:39:10] for you get mad at me if you want to
[1:39:12] forget William brownon for a minute I am
[1:39:14] Malachi
[1:39:17] 4 no disrespect but in fact I'll say
[1:39:20] this a lot that in malach if you read it
[1:39:23] it says behold I send
[1:39:27] you so God identified me before he
[1:39:33] identified he got my he called my
[1:39:36] attention to let me know hey wake up
[1:39:38] Joel Brown I'm sending you
[1:39:42] something so God has enough confidence
[1:39:45] in you in me to get our
[1:39:49] attention so I'm wrapped up tangled up
[1:39:52] tied up in Malachi 4 why because I am
[1:39:56] Malachi 4 5 and
[1:40:00] 6 those carnal individuals are trying to
[1:40:03] deify the one that was sent they want to
[1:40:05] make him something that even he himself
[1:40:07] proclaimed time and time again that he
[1:40:09] was not even so much so that he said I'm
[1:40:12] I'm leaving the field I'm stopping
[1:40:14] preaching why because he carnal
[1:40:17] individuals trying to make him be
[1:40:18] something and say that he was something
[1:40:20] and they're still running around trying
[1:40:21] to do that same thing today
[1:40:28] so if Satan would have only
[1:40:31] waited he was having an identity
[1:40:35] crisis he was wanting to be something
[1:40:37] that he
[1:40:38] wasn't don't try to be somebody you're
[1:40:41] not sa be who God's called you to
[1:40:45] be again you say well I can't I can't do
[1:40:47] it like brother Andre I can't do it like
[1:40:49] this brother that sister whatever no God
[1:40:51] don't want you to do that God don't want
[1:40:52] you to have any type of Crisis God wants
[1:40:55] you to have that Shalom that rest that
[1:40:56] peace in
[1:40:57] him that you can steady and settle
[1:41:00] yourself as you walk in him but if Satan
[1:41:03] would have only waited think about it if
[1:41:05] he had just waited if he had just been
[1:41:07] who he was he would have the very same
[1:41:10] thing that I have
[1:41:11] now invisible Union of the Bride how did
[1:41:14] you come to do this you were deceived
[1:41:16] into it by your first marriage to your
[1:41:19] adulterous paren he it's no fault of
[1:41:21] your own by I'm about to close by your
[1:41:24] natural birth somebody say Amen I'm
[1:41:25] about to close by your natural birth you
[1:41:28] come after Eve who committed adultery
[1:41:30] that's the reason you was born an
[1:41:33] adulterous you were a sinner to begin
[1:41:37] with
[1:41:39] brother me
[1:41:42] yep show was show
[1:41:48] is you are centner to begin with your
[1:41:50] own
[1:41:52] nature was born through sex desire so
[1:41:56] you come under that nature I come under
[1:41:58] that nature so it's in our nature to say
[1:42:01] bad words it's in our nature to think
[1:42:03] bad thoughts it's in our nature to do
[1:42:05] conniving
[1:42:06] things but there comes a new nature
[1:42:08] there comes a new
[1:42:10] king to where that old Nature has to be
[1:42:13] done away with that that Old King has to
[1:42:19] die we have to make sure that he is
[1:42:21] there that first husband has has to
[1:42:24] die we talk about he has to be graveyard
[1:42:30] dead not dead just out of convenience I
[1:42:33] want to put him over here no he has to
[1:42:34] be dead life has cease have a ceremony
[1:42:37] for him and everything and if if you
[1:42:40] want to do that call me I'll come and
[1:42:42] preach the
[1:42:42] funeral I'll be glad to preach the
[1:42:45] devil's
[1:42:46] funeral if that's what it takes for you
[1:42:48] to have that service for you to identify
[1:42:51] that that that the old me is gone
[1:42:56] we'll bring some saints and we'll shout
[1:42:57] we'll sing we'll tear the house
[1:43:00] down praise God my sins are gone they're
[1:43:04] underneath the blood the cross of
[1:43:06] Calvary he paid it all what more can he
[1:43:10] do he's done everything there's nothing
[1:43:12] more that Christ can do it's simply up
[1:43:14] to us to
[1:43:17] believe to have faith in God's word
[1:43:20] that's right you was deceived into it
[1:43:23] yeah you you it ain't your fault you
[1:43:26] never did it listen brother listen sis
[1:43:28] you never did it because that little
[1:43:30] germ that was in you listen to the way
[1:43:33] he says this I love this that little
[1:43:35] germ that was in you was to be you
[1:43:38] before the foundation of the
[1:43:41] world it's just a little attribute
[1:43:44] that's trying to declare itself brother
[1:43:47] talked about the little boy he saw out
[1:43:48] the man uh the flying the Kite and the
[1:43:50] man comes by he looks up he don't even
[1:43:52] see a kite the kite so far up he can't
[1:43:55] even see it so he asked the little lad
[1:43:57] he says how do you know what's up there
[1:43:58] he says every now and again I feel a
[1:44:00] little tug I feel a little pull so every
[1:44:04] now and again there's something on the
[1:44:06] inside I feel a little tug I feel a
[1:44:08] little pull when I get down when I get
[1:44:10] low I feel a little something it's my
[1:44:13] theophany yes it's that's attributes of
[1:44:16] God trying to declare itself in my life
[1:44:20] so so so so don't hinder that little
[1:44:22] pull
[1:44:26] he's present he's real he's
[1:44:28] there James 1:2 blessed is the man that
[1:44:31] endureth
[1:44:33] Temptation for when he is shot he shall
[1:44:36] receive the Crown of Life which the Lord
[1:44:40] hath promised to them that love him so a
[1:44:43] king wears a
[1:44:45] crown huh he has a crown that he wears
[1:44:48] and he has it that that that signifies
[1:44:50] to those around him I am the king
[1:44:54] so the identification that your life has
[1:44:57] changed when you endure that Temptation
[1:45:00] when you tried the Bible's clear and it
[1:45:02] says you shall receive the Crown of Life
[1:45:06] which the Lord haveth promised to them
[1:45:08] that love him that word Crown simply
[1:45:10] means a crown a mark of royalty in
[1:45:13] general an exalted Mark the wreath or
[1:45:17] Garland which was given as a prize to
[1:45:20] Victors in public games
[1:45:28] You See Me Now you see the Saints now
[1:45:31] but one day they're going to take on a
[1:45:33] different
[1:45:35] Visage they're going to have that crown
[1:45:38] that Victor crown that wreath upon their
[1:45:40] head metaphorically the Eternal
[1:45:42] blessedness which will be given as a
[1:45:45] prize to the genuine Servants of God and
[1:45:48] Christ the crown the wreath which is the
[1:45:50] reward of the righteous
[1:45:55] send your feet
[1:45:58] amen dethroning a
[1:46:01] king it's time to let the old you
[1:46:05] go it's time to let the old things go
[1:46:08] you've heard this long enough you've
[1:46:10] heard it so many times but tonight is
[1:46:12] the

[1:46:19] serve you can't serve God and the devil
[1:46:23] you can't play around with the devil and
[1:46:25] say that you're married to Christ
[1:46:27] because you put God in an adulterous
[1:46:29] situation and God ain't about any of
[1:46:31] that so that old man has to die that old
[1:46:34] Nature has to die be completely gone
[1:46:39] obliterated so I want us tonight to
[1:46:42] begin to drop some atomic bombs in our
[1:46:44] lives that we can freely be who God has
[1:46:47] called us to be amen truly be who God

[2:02:25] you know I told somebody one time in
[2:02:27] brother Jo Jesus told us to love our
[2:02:30] enemies how many of y'all do
[2:02:34] that how many does that sir that's what
[2:02:37] I thought we better start doing we got
[2:02:39] one brother Jackie said he did well I do
[2:02:42] too Jesus said pray for those who
[2:02:45] despitefully use you despitefully use
[2:02:49] you not not not sit around at at
[2:02:51] Starbucks and no you shouldn't be in
[2:02:52] starbs anyway stop somewhere dunk your
[2:02:54] donuts and eat no people that hate your
[2:02:57] guts you're supposed to love them as
[2:02:59] much as you love somebody right well
[2:03:02] it's easy to love somebody loves you but
[2:03:05] we got to love each other put our arms
[2:03:07] around each other and say God bless you
[2:03:10] listen Joel Brown's not going to live
[2:03:12] over here on this street by himself in
[2:03:13] glory true right don't want to don't
[2:03:17] want to that's right me either all you
[2:03:20] know we like I said we got King right
[2:03:23] that's Jesus Christ and that's the man
[2:03:25] we follow the man Christ Jesus and
[2:03:27] through the message of the hour that's
[2:03:29] pointing us right to that person it's
[2:03:32] not pointing us to a man it's not
[2:03:33] pointing us to a a Doctrine it's not
[2:03:35] pointing us to you got to go like
[2:03:37] brother Joel said you got to go to
[2:03:38] church here no God will share his glory
[2:03:41] with no one you hear me God will never
[2:03:44] share his glory with anyone he is a
[2:03:46] jealous God but he wants us to love him
[2:03:48] and he's given us the opportunity to do
[2:03:50] it he's G us the greatest message on the
[2:03:52] face of the Earth there is no message
[2:03:54] there is no other message than this
[2:03:56] message and I'm like I'm like old
[2:03:59] brother Willie Ross used to come preach
[2:04:00] for us years ago was a little B kid you
[2:04:02] know you probably don't remember brother
[2:04:04] willly but he'd say I have sold my soul
[2:04:07] on Malachi
[2:04:09] 4 and I believe that's true yes and we
[2:04:13] become Malachi 4 by what by the word of
[2:04:16] God right by living the word of God
