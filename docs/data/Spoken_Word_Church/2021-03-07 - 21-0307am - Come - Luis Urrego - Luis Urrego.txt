man good to see each one of you and we just appreciate uh the lord and appreciate the opportunity that he gives us amen to say something to help his people amen amen we don't we don't come here you know at least that's not my purpose and to show off or anything like that i hope there's something that can be said that would help you to minister to your need god knows your needs i don't know your needs god does and he can minister directly exactly to that point amen so we just thank god for allowing us to be in the house of god continue to pray for my wife christine she's getting much better and she developed a urinary tract infection and then it because of her taking antibiotics for it it developed into a yeast infection and then all that so it you just just pray for her and uh but she's getting better from this from this uh covet and lord willing maybe next sunday should be here with us again so pray also for zoe as well um also uh um i also asked that you all pray for my my mom and my dad as well as they're battling with this covet as well my daddy's getting much better but my mom it's really been affecting her so uh you just remember her in prayer it they're they're not having problems breathing or anything like that but it's really affecting her in in the uh emotionally and mentally um she feels like she's not herself you know and it's very strange she's losing her she doesn't even want to eat doesn't want to uh her appetite's gone um just the thought of food and water makes her want to vomit so you just remember her in prayer you know and and and just reading some of the symptoms of this there's a lot of people that have had this where they they they vomit just thinking about food and water so uh but i know god can deliver her from that he's done that many times for her in different situations and i know this time it's no different it's just another devil just trying to rear his horns amen um and so we just appreciate the lord right before we go to read the word uh you just may be seated for just a moment i wanted to i wanted to show something real quick um if the brothers could bring the first picture up uh you know i ke i stay in touch with with the brothers uh in nicaragua and honduras i s uh i still stay and and try to be in touch with what's going on over there and um but i wanted to talk about real quick just bring up this this need uh of for a family now some of some of the uh you brothers uh have already um helped out with this need but um there's a family last year that they had a they had a one-year-old son and uh all throughout last year's as as bad as it was you know and they were having to they were battling with the health of their little boy the little boy pretty much came to a point where he got real sick i cannot remember the the what exactly what he had anyways back in november december the little the little baby died the lord decided to take them and so the family is a family it was a family of four now it's a family of three this is their this was their little house that they lived in in nicaragua and uh far cry for some some of our houses that we that we stay at and then sometimes we complain but but you see while they were going back and forth uh to the hospital um with the little baby um you know they they had people going into their house taking things from from their house taking uh pretty much tearing down the house i mean they would actually tear down the house and take it for materials and and things like that but they would come home and and of course you know that they would be at the hospital more often than they were than they were at the house so um they decided to just leave this place he he what he did the brother did is he just took off the roof because that was all that was pretty much left in the in the house and decided to take it elsewhere and his mom helped supply a piece of property so that they could build a new house on top because this place they decided to leave it since it was so dangerous it was a dangerous area for them to live i mean you got robbers just going in all the time through through the place so they never asked me for anything i just took it upon my heart i said brother uh how much would it cost to build you a little place he said well just a little kitchen and a little living room and just one one bedroom for for him and his two for them and him his one daughter uh it only cost them like 4 200 just about just to have them a little brand new place that they're going to build themselves and and they're going to and it's a safer area so if you want to if you want to skip to the next picture this is some i asked them to please take some pictures of how the structure ended up being and and things like that and and he did and next picture and next picture this is this is where they used to live next picture next and so i asked him to please send me exactly how how much everything would cost detailed and they did and so it come out in from converted to knit from nicaraguan money to us dollars it'd be like 4 200 next this is the family right here and that's brother um brother mario and his wife scarlett and i can't remember the little girl's name so i've worked sister scarlett uh with i've uh has a brother who who does mission work around the around the country and i've worked with him personally so uh they're very fine family very fun family and love the lord so you remember the family in prayer because haven't just lost their one-year-old baby and then not even have a home right now to live in is a terrible thing i'm pretty much homeless at the point right now and having to stay um at their parents home and at his parents home but they're a family and they should have their own home so next i think there's one or two more okay so that's it so uh i'm just bringing this need if you feel that you wanna help out i'm gonna send them some funds this coming week to them some of you have already helped out but if you want to put something extra to help them out and then we'll uh we'll get something to you i'll tell them to create a video or something for you saying thank you for the funds okay but just remember the family and if you can't give that's okay pray for the family pray because prayer availeth much thank you let's stand back to our feet and we're going to go to the word now let's turn to matthew 14. amen and we just want to talk this morning a little bit about faith amen i just felt like to go this route this morning and uh i believe satan is uh is on a rampage say man he's uh he's doing everything he can to hinder our faith and to wave make it waver and toss it to and fro and so we want to talk a little bit about that this morning but before we read the word let's just bow our hands our gracious lord jesus as we come before you father we pray lord that you would father god minister to us father in your in this special way lord you know heavenly father what each and every one of my brothers and sisters here have need of and we just ask you lord god that you come down on the scene lord jesus and minister directly to that need father god lord jesus i'm insufficient within myself lord but lord your everything to us father god and there's nothing lord that you cannot do lord so we pray that you would just come speak through your word lord god continue to be there with sister cleed of father god and continue to strengthen her mending her lord god and and and lord sister tootsie and all of the different ones lord god that they're sick father we just pray that you'd minister to them we thank you lord for strengthening brother kern thank you for healing him lord lord and we just appreciate heavenly father that even though through times of chaos times of crisis times lord where we lose our health father god you promised us healing through your word lord and lord jesus we just ask you now father that you would have your way here and be with the ones traveling right now lord protect them and lord bless brother wade lord as he's ministering father this morning you anoint him in a mighty way to say something that would help your people there in that area lord jesus granted lord we commit ourselves into your hands now in jesus christ's name amen amen amen let's read in in math in matthew chapter 14 verses uh verses 22. amen praise the lord amen when they had heard these words i'm sorry matthew chapter 14. i had it here and then i lost it all right and straightway jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is i be not afraid how many would just love to just have those words said directly to you amen praise god well he has he said him through his word amen and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee under water and he said come and when peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefore did his doubt doubt and when they were come into the ship the wind ceased then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him saying of a truth thou art the son of god amen praise god so that's where we want to leave it off you may be seated this morning the lord had a blessing to his word amen i just want to title this this morning want to call it come amen just simply just come praise god and and uh we've read this this scripture many many times amen and you find it in different in different uh parts of the scriptures you'll even find it in john in in in the book of john but in matthew is the only time that we see where it actually talks about peter walking on the water amen peter walking on the water and you might say oh my that that's that's impossible you know a lot of people nowadays they want to try to prove that the message is wrong and and try to prove that the bible is wrong amen but but you see there's things in the word amen that we've got to just take by faith the christian life is not just about prove to me proof to me and and proof but it's about faith because if god if god could just prove everything to us and just hand it to us on a silver platter then you wouldn't need to have exercise your faith there's no purpose for you to exercise your faith if god just hands everything to you but amen for the fact that he has us guessing sometimes he's asked us he has us wondering sometimes amen that's the rea that's the reason that he just wants to exercise your faith think about that amen we don't have to explain anything jesus didn't ask you can you explain it when he would talk to the people can can no he said do you believe it do you believe it and that's all we have to do in this hour amen is just believe it praise god you know faith is mentioned in the old testament only two times the word faith right amen but in the in the new testament it's mentioned 245 times and we know that even so this tells me that even in the old testament amen when the the the saints in the old testament the great things that they did that's talked about in hebrews chapter 11 and they and it was it was that was the faith that they had right nothing explained to them they just they the need was arose and they just acted upon it now here in the new testament man that we live in we talk about the faith our faith our faith amen lots about faith 240 times five times mentioned in the bible amen we must live by faith in this hour we must actually live by faith more than when we ever have lived by faith praise god our faith is very important praise the lord so i want to take a look at this at this uh this story here and just kind of work with it and see how the lord leads amen praise god and then and there in verse 22 it says and straightway jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes away this is this this happened right here just right after jesus had fed the the multitude about 5000 people actually and it was actually more because the 5000 was just only the man if you read in the scripture there was actually more it was more children there was women but they were not even counted it could have been 10 000 that he fed with just two loaves and five five or five fish or two fish and five loaves of bread from a little boy's lunch box he fed ten thousand amen how much more he can he not feed you and take care of you amen if he could take the lunch box amen brother branham said he only used what the little boy gave gave to him and that's what the same thing with us god can only use what you give to him i've often said if you give him your arm that's the only thing that he can use if that's all you give him but if you give him all of yourself then he can use all of you sometimes the thing is is that we're like peter we don't we get afraid we don't want to go we don't want to take the next step amen but god wants to use all of you and all we give him is a little finger in other words you're not giving him all the full potential that that's in you amen but but god god is challenging us in this hour amen praise god god is god has challenges in us and is in the hour that we're living is to just come amen praise god amen so we see that that that you know the days of the of the great revivals and all those things amen those things are they're not here with us they'd be wonderful i mean who loves to be in a nice uh tent meeting and and the sawdust trail and all all that that's that's wonderful that's nice amen but do you know what saints right now god is dealing with us as individuals amen he's always been dealing with us as individuals but now more often than ever right amen more more it's it's an individual walk between you and god yes brother dale can't help you amen he can't push you to do anything even the holy spirit can't push you to do anything it's an individual walk between you and god you decide if you want to serve god amen you decide if you want to come to church amen you decide if you want to read the word you decide if you want to pray amen it's between you and god god can't push you just like brother dale's been speaking about predestination amen god doesn't take us through through a tube and push us through a tube and we come out the other side just you know in glorified bodies amen that's not how it works there's a decision amen there's a there's a there's a choice that you must make in this hour amen whether i'm going to move on with god or not it's limited to what we as ministers can do amen what we can do is pray for you you got to do the rest that's right amen you've got to walk with god amen you've got to come amen before god amen you're the one who has to have that close relationship with god because it's between you and god you want to be like him amen come to him just come praise god amen so we see that those days they're not here with us anymore but he's still here amen god still god never died amen right god still the holy spirit is still working praise the lord aren't you thankful for that amen he's gathering his elect amen throughout from all the different countries amen praise god on this great ship of zion on the great ship of zion praise the lord and you better get on you better get on if you want to do if you if you want to get to the other side you better get on this great ship of zion don't think you're going to make it with your own ideas don't think you're going to make it with your own thoughts and your own oh well i'm going to do it this way no you've got to get on that great ship of zion and let that great ship of zion take you to its destination amen because the captain he's got a destination in mind you all you got to do is get in your ticket has been paid praise god you've got the holy ghost amen that's your ticket amen get on and let god do the rest hallelujah praise the lord jesus because saints he's called us to do the greater works in this hour amen he said greater works than these shall ye do for i go unto my father's what he told the disciples now we know that greater works he amen it's it's he he was speaking about the the quantity of works i mean the quality of works amen the quality and the and and the quantity amen but you see in this hour saints there's a people that's supposed to do the greater works in this hour there's a greater work that you and i must do in this hour praise god do you know that they're infer in first thessalonians i believe that where it says that we shall be caught in a moment and twinkling an eye that hasn't been fulfilled somebody's got to fulfill that is that a greater work or not because saints think about this jesus died yet he resurrected the prophet even passed away he's gone from us amen somebody's not gonna die somebody's destined to not see death in this hour somebody is destined to be standing alive amen and in the moment in the twinkling of an eye be changed be transformed that hasn't happened somebody has got to manifest that it might as well just be you and i right man i'm not saying just here in this church but i'm just saying the the church that's alive today amen praise god that's i think that's something great to look forward to amen and i believe not really to look forward to but actually taking place within us now amen it's taking place the rapture is taking place from the inside and it manifests on the outside it's not something that just takes place on the outside it's got to start inside first remember the kingdom of god has to start taking place inside first that change and then it manifests on the outside praise the lord jesus amen amen first corinthians 15 52 in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump amen just like that somebody's gonna fulfill that glory might as well just be you and me amen somebody's gonna fulfill that praise god amen you were not called here to be an intellectual that's right you were not called here amen to just just have head knowledge about the word amen you were called here to manifest the word and you were called here to be the word and live the word and manifest the word to a dying people praise god that's desiring amen to see the word alive to see the word amen in power praise god hallelujah amen verse 23 there it says and when he had sent the multitudes away jesus had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone amen in in john chapter six you can read another portion there of this of what happened there but in john chapter 6 15 he he went to to the mountain to pray alone because it says there that when jesus therefore perceived that they would that they would and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain him by himself alone amen he he knew they realized david this is the messiah this is this they were getting ready to make him a king amen but that's not what he wanted he didn't come here to establish earthly kingdoms amen there will be an earthly kingdom amen but he wanted to establish that kingdom first in the people's hearts in the people's soul amen and when that kingdom is in your soul first amen then you can rule appropriately praise god amen then maybe he went up to a mountain up there also to pray for his disciples because he knew amen what was getting ready to happen maybe he went amen to make himself a little prepared for what was getting ready to happen the event that they were getting ready to to to to face amen and that's the same thing with with with us saints amen god at this moment no matter what's taking place in your life amen he's up there amen interceding for you aren't you thankful that we have an intercessor in this hour praise god amen romans chapter 8 verse 34 he says who who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us amen praise the lord romans 8 26 light wise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered amen aren't you thankful that he's there amen make an intercession for you and me praise god amen i i i definitely need some intercession i don't know about you amen i make i make mistakes many times i fail him in many ways i get laxed i get lazy amen i'm thankful that he's there interceding for me praise god thank you lord and and i and if he if you if you yeah if you can't say the same thing amen then then and maybe you're i don't know but god amen sometimes we just get in these modes that that we just like just get on get get on the uh uh what is it the cruise control you know and we just get on cruise control and just whatever happens you know whatever happens but sometimes we have to shift amen shift those gears work at it a little bit amen hold that collection amen in order for us to move praise god i missed the days when i had my little my little honda civic that now you know my little five-speed honda civic it was fun too amen but i never fell asleep [Laughter] at least not while i was on the interstate while i was on the interstate you know driving on fifth gear amen that's when it would that's when the sleep would come in but god amen when you are actually doing something amen busy doing something not just anything but i'm just saying busy in service for him well praying what can i do here what can i do there come at the church amen it's an overcoming to even come to church in this hour to pick up the bible and read that's an overcoming praise god don't see it as a as a burden amen i teach my daughters let everything the bible says everything that you do do it as unto the lord even when i tell them to go clean their room don't do it for me do it for the lord amen don't tell your wife i love you do it for the lord because in you amen doing that for for your wife amen you're doing it for the lord and in her bringing in a man making her happy making her satisfied amen doing the things amen you're doing it for the lord it's going to cause a godly atmosphere to come into amen same thing with us the wives to the husband you know exactly what your husband likes but he didn't treat me right last night he fell asleep when i was talking to him on the bed and so i'm not going to say anything to him well you're the one that can change an atmosphere amen the atmosphere is heavy in the home why don't you guys call something to change that atmosphere amen same thing with us with you children amen parents might not be might not be in the right mental i mean they've been working all day and might be frustrated amen what can you do to change the atmosphere it doesn't have to be laid just on the parents every time what can you young people do to change the atmosphere amen praise god why am i getting into this amen praise the lord i think same time sayings that the gospel just just has to come down to our level so so we can understand sometimes amen because it's in these things and these daily things that we we fail him many times amen sure we know the word we know what the we know these things but then can you apply them can you do them at home can you serve your husband the way you should can you serve your wife the way you should do you really love your children and spend time with them amen these are the things that really matter praise god amen now verse 24 it says but the ship was now in the midst of the seat tossed with waves for the wind was contrary now the disciples they got onto the ship amen and jesus told them hey listen i'm going to meet you on the other side i'm going to meet you there so they should have just taken god to take them as word amen but all of a sudden here comes this wind here comes the storm coming to our lives amen and it's just like us saints here god's given us his commandment amen to be saved and serve god amen and to live for him and then we think everything is going to be all right we're going to get there just fine jesus said so in his word we won't have any problems whatsoever there won't be any issues at all and then all of a sudden the wind starts howling the rain starts pouring and we're stuck in the middle of the sea not knowing exactly where to go i can't see far off but it doesn't matter he said that i'll meet you on the other side just keep roaring just keep rowing amen i'll meet you on the other side praise god amen i mean don't we feel like that sometimes right when we feel like god amen that he's abandoned us and that he's not with us amen but he's he's there amen interceding for you amen right there he was jesus was right there interceding for his disciples maybe he was probably looking out he knew exactly where they were at just like he knows exactly where you are in your problem he knows exactly what you need he knows exactly but he knows that you need to go through that just to get you to the point where he needs you to go from point a to point b amen she needs to go through that to get to point b he needs to go through that in order to get to point b amen god knows all these things but we sometimes think amen that he doesn't but the bible says that he's interceding for us the bible says that he is the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities in other words he knows what you're going through he knows exactly he's been through it he's been he knows what it's like to be a human he knows what it's like to be a child he knows what it's like to be a young person amen he went through exactly what you're going through so don't think amen don't believe what satan says he i i don't know he does he's not mindful of what i'm going through he knows exactly what you're going through just have faith in his word have faith in his word that he said i'll meet you on the other side because he promised that he would yes amen hallelujah thank you amen you know sometimes things this ship that we're in amen that we're riding in it may get beaten and battered sometimes some of you all have gone through things amen that that i you know that are hard amen but saints amen let your anchor still hold yes amen you're still here you've made it god's brought you this far if he wanted you to go that certain point in your life that you went through something so hard if he wanted you to give up and let go right there and then you would have just done it then but yet you're still here you're still here walking amen you're still here amen desiring lord amen that means he's not through with you he's still trying to get you to point b praise god he's still trying to get you to the other side but sometimes we're the ones who are no lord i don't want to i know but he's trying to get to the other side and he needs to bring us through the sea sometimes through the tumultuous seed don't you think that god didn't know that the disciples were going to go through a storm of course he knew i believe so i believe he went up there praying for them he was praying for his for his children for his disciples exactly knowing what they were going to go through praise god amen as the song goes the anchor holds though the ship's been battered the anchor holds as though the cells are torn amen though this thing's amen it's going in been chaos amen god's still on the throne don't give up amen it's too it's too late in the game to throw in the towel amen to to to to get all all in a frenzy and not know what to do amen god knows what to do so let's trust his word amen he gave us exactly amen what he what his will for us in his word and all we got to do is just obey it's just amen just listen to his word amen glory now verse 25 it says and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them walking on the sea amen amen the storm this storm was hitting the disciples in the darkest time the day of the of the night the fourth watch in the bible amen is the darkest time in the night is the time between 3 a.m and 6 a.m those are the darkest times of the night brother branham said just right before the sun comes up it gets real dark right and the disciples were out there in the middle of the sea around three to six in the morning that's when this storm hit them amen and don't you say where we're living in that time right now saints we're living in the darkest time that ever has existed amen right now plus we're in a sea and this great ship of zion saints we don't know amen the the winds are howling the winds are blowing things are happening pandemic here the the you know government politics amen you can't put no trust in them anymore or anything you never could but i mean everything's just falling apart not going your way amen right but he's still mindful of what's going on he's still up there interceding i'm still watching i'm still look at them amen this wind's blowing this lord you be with them he's with you saints amen he's still mindful there can be five pandemics going on and yet he's still a man mindful of what's going on he's still mindful of what's happening in your life praise god amen as stormy as agitated and and tumultuous as the waves are amen jesus allowed it to get that way jesus allows things in your life to get that way amen god you know what god likes to do he likes for your troubles to get lengthened a little bit he likes for your troubles to to to to have a little bit of length to it because he knows exactly what he needs to get you to shift your mind amen to his way and to stop thinking of it your way amen praise god see in our minds he we think that he's late in our mind we think that when he shows up and finally gives the solution lord you're late you came late that's what martha or one of the two sisters told him when he came to resurrect lazarus lord if you had been here my brother wouldn't have died but if he would have been there amen it would have been it wouldn't have been a greater miracle amen that it was because god has a purpose for all things right amen see in your mind he's late but he's always on time amen the bible says i mean he's i think there's a song amen he's a non-time god yes he is he's never late he's not like like some of us amen i'm here i know i fell in that category but but when you're i like i like what brother dale says amen when you're when you're early amen when you get when you're there on time you're late praise god but god see him and he's he's always on time he's never rushed he's never he's never it's not like things taken by surprise amen he knows exactly what you need to get you to point b amen to get you to get to the other side praise god amen so you got to remember that jesus had already told him that he was going to meet them on the other side amen amen praise the lord and jesus he knew that they were going to get to the other side because you know he had to meet them there he hit that same faith amen that jesus had for them his disciples to get to the other side it's the same faith that he has for you and me that you're going to make it to the other side amen amen the bible says that he didn't start this work in you to just leave you alone afterwards he said the work that he's begun in you he will perform it to the day of the lord jesus christ in other words he'll take care of the rest just stay with his word amen praise god now verse 25 says and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them walking on the scene now we just read that amen and we find that uh jesus had them exactly where he wanted them to be amen in the darkest night time of the of the night it wasn't in the early days it wasn't in the early in the evening hours amen it was in the darkest time he had them exactly where he wanted them to be so that he could manifest himself and god has you exactly where he wants you to be saints god god knows amen why he allows things in your life praise the lord and it's not to harm you but to help you amen john 6 8 amen the bible says this i i never i didn't know this this verse existed but it says it says there that which alone talking about god it says which alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the sea amen see the disciples should have known that god can do that because they read it in the word that he can walk on the sea he created the sea so he can walk on it he could do he's the master of the sea amen praise god so as job says there and treadeth upon the waves of the sea but what happened was here look at verse 26 and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear brother said often the thing that could help you is what you're afraid of we're often so scared of the thing that can help you and yet that's the thing that can real that's the thing that can really help you amen we're afraid of that that can help us the disciples amen the jews at that time uh i was just reading a little bit they were especially the pharisees they were very superstitious and so they believed a lot in demons they believed a lot and all those things and they believed on they believed in one that would actually come and take the little children at night and and those i don't know what the name of the demon was but they had all these superstitions in their in their in their mind and so the disciples they grew up with these superstitions you see amen and plus they were sailors and so sailors you know they have their own superstition about things and stuff like that amen and here comes jesus walking to them in the water and they've stopped fearing the wind and the rain and more they they forgot about that because they thought a ghost was coming to him that's what the bible says they feared that a spirit was coming to them to do some harm to them not knowing that it was god's it was it was the holy spirit praise god because jesus is the spirit amen right god himself amen coming to them and they were afraid of that that could really help them during that time things i wonder if that's how we are here goes the word amen here comes something that that's taken amen the solution in your life and we're afraid of it because it doesn't meet our expectation it doesn't come the way we think it should come right amen we're afraid of it and that we can't get any results then amen you can only get results from the word if you believe the word amen the word amen is the solution but if you don't believe it you can't get results from it amen and believing it is to act upon it see your faith amen can't just be intellectual it has to take action it has to take action your faith has to take action in order for things to happen right right amen do think about the the impo even if you look crazy or if you look dumb amen still do it right because without it in in action faith in action it doesn't it doesn't it won't work amen then it just becomes just head knowledge amen we got too much of that we need action now amen too much about to many of us we know the word now it's time to take action glory amen take action on the word it's time to take action amen right how are we going to come into a body change amen taking action having faith in his word amen believing his word amen acting upon it amen when a little problem comes hits your life or something even big comes hits your life amen take action lord you are allowing this for me to get from point a to point b and if point b amen has a body change then lord let it be i'm coming to it amen i'm coming to it i don't care what what needs to happen sure it's hard sure stuff the losing of a loved one is hard somebody's sick in your family is tough uh children that are gone astray not even serving the lord amen that's hard amen but lord if this is what i've got to go through because remember when god is allowing things in our lives he's not just doing it for the person amen for that person amen he's also doing it for the people around you as well amen the influence is around you yeah right god god allows the situations for many different purposes right not just for you so don't think about it just for for you think about it lord what is it that you're trying to do the whole picture the whole picture amen praise god amen brother branham says this and the message be not afraid of his eyes he says but the very thing that could help them and the only thing that could help them they were afraid of it and today it's the same thing they're afraid to take a hold of the holy spirit they're afraid to believe god's message they're afraid to believe the holy spirit when they see it working among them they'll say now wait a minute i don't know whether it could be for me or not it's for whosoever will brother brown says healing's for everybody salvation is for whosoever will come anybody amen thanks what do we get out of worrying amen i was listening to brother branham coming up the road here to church and he said this he said if they told you tomorrow that you were getting ready to die amen if tomorrow if you knew tomorrow you were gonna die what would it benefit you to worry what would it benefit you to to uh get all uh you know in a frenzy what would it benefit you you say well you know what can faith do for me and brother branson says faith can take me out amen faith can give faith if if i was in a firing squad and they were gonna amen they were going to shoot me amen for a supposed crime that i did faith can deliver me faith can sign my pardon you do more with faith than you do with worry amen faith amen is the hope of things uh is faith faith is the thing is it is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen it's the it's the thing that you can see amen it's it's the substance a man that can help you amen uh uh when you're when you're walking in life amen it's the tangible thing it's it's just as real as is more real than your problem so why worry amen faith faith can deliver me worry can't so so why worry praise god faith can sign my pardon glory amen and you know we see people amen people today that they're leaving the word leaving this message they're afraid of it now they're afraid of it and now now the very word amen that can help them they're afraid of it the very word praise god verse 27 says but straightway jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is i be not afraid amen amen i like that word there straightway because that word means immediately amen jesus spoke to them in a familiar tone amen when they when he saw that they were scared and in a frenzy and and they thought it was a ghost amen he spoke to them in a familiar tone to let them know and let them know hey it is i it's not anybody else it's not something else it is i i've been walking with you all this time amen it's that same voice amen it's that same voice walking with you amen the same voice amen that spoke to you at the beginning praise god is the same voice that's speaking now praise the lord is this he's the same yesterday today and forever amen he never he never changes oh but i didn't feel him amen you don't have to feel him amen he gave us his word amen you don't have to feel anything nobody he said did you feel it no he asked did you believe it that's what he asked the people there in the bible did you feel something no i didn't feel anything well then then then to believe it amen and and peter answered him and said lord now watch this i want to get now to kind of the meat of the of the messes and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water so when peter heard that voice amen now remember the winds were still blowing the rain was still coming through it was still the darkest time of the night but when peter heard that voice it sparked the faith in him right there to say something as ridiculous as that it it it it's ridiculous why in the world i mean it has it makes no sense whatsoever but it sparks something in him and say lord if it be you bid me to come unto thee and you know what jesus told him he didn't argue with him he didn't say he didn't say peter you're not born again you don't have the holy ghost right you don't you don't you don't he didn't give him the greek or the hebrew or anything like that he said come see sometimes we want to give somebody amen we want to give them the greek we want to explain to them everything and you think that by explaining every single little detail amen point a b c d amen are you born again yet and you realize that that doesn't work amen just tell them come just you you want to do it if you really want to do it then just come amen sometimes us explaining too much and giving too much uh explanation about things might even harm more than than it helps amen sometimes our families amen aren't ready to receive certain things yet and all they need to hear is just come just come to church amen what did uh i believe it was andrew amen that told james or jesus said we've seen the messiah he said come see really you've seen him just come see come see for yourself amen and see what the good lord has given us amen but peter this sparked something in peter amen and he didn't care amen he didn't care what the others were saying amen he didn't care amen about about what the disciples were getting ready to say to him or what they were thinking amen he just said lord if it be you bid me to come and the disciples probably thought man what that's strange peter's asking such a thing amen that's weird but peter didn't care right he still he said lord you bid me to come amen remember peter was not even born again peter didn't even have the holy ghost during this time amen think about that saints you who say who have the holy ghost and get a man caught up in a frenzy amen by every single thing in your life amen there's no need for that that's right amen when all you have to do is just come have faith in his word amen have faith in his word amen now brother branham talks about that spur of a moment faith amen look what he says here amen because that's what peter had there at that moment brother brahm says i want to tell you something now work on that pulsation that spur of a moment like joshua did like mary magdalene all those just that moment when something is revealed to you grab it amen hold to it that spur of a moment praise god amen and so as as the word is going forth and and something reveals to you something reveals to you my child will be will be healed my son will come to the lord or whatever it is amen if that is revealed to you then satan can't take that away from you amen hold to that and take advantage of that right there and then amen because that will stay with you amen that will anchor you that will help anchor you and this is exactly what peter i believe what peter amen when he heard that familiar voice of jesus amen it caused a spur of the moment faith right there in him see a spur of the moment of faith and to say lord if it's you tell me to come right right bid me to come amen praise god hold on to whatever it is amen god was revealing to you amen don't let satan take it out and take it out of you and you see god amen man come on the scene amen because that's you believing his word that's you believing and taking hold right there anchoring yourself to that word amen and he said come that's what jesus told him he said come in verse 29 and when peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus now i want you to put yourself in peter's shoes amen here here is on the boat storm's still going man the storm's still going right now there and and and all everything's going around and and and he's told to come and so he just gets out and starts walking amen just takes god that just takes jesus at his word and starts walking walking on water and man he might be walking like a little baby you know but he's walking i want to see you try to walk on water right and people criticize peter amen because he sunk but he walked on water have you walked on water amen he started walking away maybe he was walking a little taking little baby steps maybe he even went a little backwards sometimes amen but he was walking on water amen but t bring that down to our level saying say amen don't criticize the brother who's walking amen just little bits here and there amen who's hanging on amen a little bit here and there or or if you're taking the strut maybe you're not taking the strides that you want to take amen just keep walking amen jesus told you to come just keep walking amen that's all you got to worry about amen worry about the end goal amen don't worry about your circumstances amen peter at that moment was not even concerned that it was the winds were howling and the disciples were criticizing him i mean look i can't believe that he's doing that he didn't care amen brother so and so said this about me sister so-and-so thinks that i'm this this that or the other i don't care i'm still walking to jesus amen jesus told me to come amen and i'm going amen because he said so amen and and that's what we got to do amen the word tells me to do such and such i'm going because the word tells me so yeah that's right i don't care what sister so-and-so says i don't care what brother so-and-so said it doesn't matter to me the word told me so amen the word says so and i'm going to obey the word and jesus is the word amen the word said so [Applause] praise god oh my if we we would just take that attitude today amen we would far advance in our walk amen sometimes our young people lay man they get they get fearful amen because of what such and such might say if i do this amen that or the other if i take this step in my life amen it doesn't matter amen zach has your life been improved or has it been worse since you started really serving the lord i would declare to say that it's been improved my life was never god never got worse when i decided to serve god i think it improved god amen is always improving our lives amen he's never depreciating our lives amen when you take that step of faith amen he never depreciates you he helps you for you to get advanced amen to advance he appreciates your life amen amen now jesus didn't tell him no no watch out peter hold on a second wait wait a second your faith you you have wavering faith no he just said come and he's telling you and i in this hour to come well no peter he didn't start explaining that you know this that or the other two and the amen he said come peter praise god amen god doesn't put limits on our christian walk he doesn't you and i are the ones who put those limits on our walk you and i as i said earlier you give him your arm that's all he'll use you give him everything he'll use that amen we're the ones who limit ourselves from receiving god's blessings praise god amen peter heard that word amen and it was sufficient enough for him to hear that voice the word said so i believe it that settles it i'm going amen see faith is simply taking the next step that's what faith is it's just taking the next step in your life it seems hard it seems difficult but just take it amen because it'll unleash the supernatural but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid now speaking about peter he when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me amen don't look at your problems in your life right amen just keep walking somebody criticized you just keep walking amen there's a pandemic going on outside just keep walking amen biden's doing such and such just keep walking amen cnn says such and such just keep walking fox news says such and such you just keep walking amen praise god just keep walking don't don't put your eye on the winds and on the storm and don't put your eye on the critics amen keep walking amen jesus said so you just keep walking come on remember he said come just go amen keep walking sometimes we fix our our pr our eyes on on the things of life so much amen and we forget where we came from we forget we lose our first love right man have you ever been that way that love and that zeal that you had for god when you first came to god and you and then you start thinking and looking at all these other things around you in life and i got a family now you know i got my children and i got to work and this and and then you forget amen how it was that first love to serve god you don't even spend time with him anymore the way you should right amen do that five minute quick prayer in the morning amen when you used to get up an hour early just just to pray not even to eat breakfast just to pray amen let's get back to the first love amen praise god and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand to see i like that that even though peter was sinking jesus didn't rebuke him he said you see you see i told you right no he just immediately picked him up he immediately picked him up he didn't he didn't he didn't start quoting him he didn't he didn't say you unbeliever you know he didn't say you you you you non-christian you you need the holy ghost that's the reason why you were sinking no he didn't tell him none of that he said oh ye of little faith you may be sit down right he said oh ye of little faith glory now i want you to understand this saints that god often times jesus would tell the the people that he would heal he would say it's by your faith that you've been healed it's by your faith that you received such and such it's not a super-duper faith that you need now i want you to pay attention to this and think about this you don't need a super-duper faith to grow in you in order to get what you need you only need to use what you have already use the faith that god has given you sure there's people with with a stronger faith amen maybe than you or or or or but see saints they can only act upon the faith that god's given them right or use what god has given you now and only with that amen it's not the quantity of the faith it's the quality of the faith the the the bible jesus talked about the the green of mustard if your faith can be be of the size of a grain of mustard seed you can move mountain really if you look at it it's not the actual size of the faith it's not because it's smaller because it's big it's the quality of that grain it's the quality of that seed amen and it's the quality amen of the holy ghost the same the portion the small portion of holy spirit that god has given you the down payment that he has given you is the same it has the same properties as as god's full amen see of eternal life the same little teaspoon of ocean water that you can get from the ocean it has the same properties that the whole ocean has so use it use that little bit of faith that you have because it's that's exactly what jesus told peter here amen oh ye of little faith not necessarily telling him you don't have such a great faith amen you didn't use you you forgot you stopped using what you already had peter didn't walk out he didn't he didn't read he didn't read a man a lot of a lot of stuff right before he walked out on the boat he just heard come and he just walked out right right he didn't get time have time to prepare he didn't have time to do that amen just amen sometimes you got to step out on faith on things you just got to and say lord i'm i'm doing this and then then let let the water just hold me up amen but i'm i'm going because your word said so right amen amen these saints god is not going to allow more in your life than than what you can handle he never has and he never will he's not going to put more in your life that you can hand you can't handle and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefore didest thou doubt in other words why did you doubt peter you were going such a good way you you you were believing my word amen and brother so and so said something to you and now you're just all shattered into pieces now amen this happened in your life and now you're just you're just broken you complete you can't you can't seem to move on amen amen why did you doubt you were believing my word when everything was going good why can't you believe my word now that's when we need to believe god's word when everything is going bad everything's not going our way that's when we need to believe god's word amen amen praise the lord and skip ahead and amen and when and when they were coming to the ship the wind ceased now i want to ask you a question saints when when jesus picked peter back up amen how do you think peter got back to the boat do you ever think about that it must have been that he walked back again to the boat because the bible doesn't say that jesus picked him up and carried him to the boat it must have been that when he picked him up he got him back on his feet again walking on the water amen sometimes we fall sometimes we fail sometimes we do things that we're not supposed to do brother branham said that we willfully sometimes do things wrong amen he still he knows your heart in that repentant heart of yours amen he picks you up amen and he's still walking amen but you're not by yourself amen peter wasn't by himself amen now that he's back up again walking amen jesus was holding his hand this time amen he wasn't walking by himself this time amen jesus was walking with peter back to the boat i believe that right amen i mean wouldn't you amen when something happens in your life and you went through it amen and god's uh delivered you god helped you through something amen don't you think that would cause faith in your life amen to grow even more than what you had it at the beginning of the trial amen i believe peter walked back to the boat with jesus amen praise the lord it doesn't matter what you've done saints amen right doesn't matter what's happened in your life god is a god of many chances god is a god of many many chances amen we limit god amen we limit god but god is a god of many chances praise the lord amen but it it was it was peter's uh his that spontaneous faith that he had amen that allowed him to walk on water amen that's the faith that we need amen that same faith that that we have in jesus amen and saint peter did this without the holy ghost how much can we do amen with the holy ghost in our lives amen peter walked on water without the holy ghost what can we do with the holy ghost amen and then when they got to the water when they got to the boat i'm almost done here but i got hot there for a moment when they got to the boat the bible says that they the the storm ceased amen when they got to the boat the wind stopped amen it's when you get to point b that everything will truly stop in your life amen but as far as as far as this world is concerned amen amen things amen you be a new beginning i mean there's no ending to god now god is god is eternal amen it's a circle that just keeps going around and around and around there's no ending to it amen praise god but when they got back to that boat that's when things ceased amen then they that were in the ship came and worshiped him saying of a truth thou art the son of god amen satan would want to really sift your life amen remember he in in luke chapter 22 uh verse 31 there it says and uh jesus speaking to peter he said and the lord said simon simon behold satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat that's how that's how satan is doing to some of us sometimes amen just sifting us as we just doing what he wants to do amen but but look what jesus says there he says but i have prayed for thee that that that thy faith failed not right amen he knew he knew that peter's faith amen was going to be challenged again in a greater way than than it was than walking on the water we think oh my peter walked on water that's awesome faith that's great faith no it was greater faith amen to stay with the word you see but peter peter or jesus prayed for him and you know what saints jesus prayed for us as well he prayed for us in john chapter 17. amen do you want to read his own words about what he said about you read john chapter 17. when whenever satan comes in and starts attacking your mind whenever satan comes in and start and starts working in your in your mind about this that or the other amen read john 17. read what he said about you read what read the faith amen that that he is speaking amen about us having amen even in the hour that we're living in praise god because he wants you to come to a point where you say it's not my will lord amen but it's dying amen jesus greatest trial amen was was dying to himself during the garden of gethsemane do you believe that that was the greatest trial that he ever had i mean it was probably worse than even than even dying on the cross to die to himself so that his word can work through his life so that he could fulfill his purpose that was the worst trial amen and i know that's hard it's tough for for us to to uh amen to give in to our to to the word amen and let the word do the work in our lives amen it's hard it's hard because we want to let the flesh take over amen but you've got to come to lord is not my will but thine will be done amen and you see that when you do that the bible says there that jesus was ministered to by angels angels came down and ministered to jesus amen even in that time because he sacrificed himself amen for the greater purpose to get to point b amen they believe the disciples got to to where they needed to get amen but they needed to go through that amen in order for it for i mean to learn something in their life to increase their faith same thing with each one of us saints we've got to go through things in life amen christian walk isn't easy christian walk is not a flowery bread of the bed of ease amen but it's a walk of promise it's a walk of it's a walk of of reward amen it's a god is never god doesn't promise things to be easy but god promises amen that we'll get to the to the end he told the disciples get to the get on the boat get to the i'll meet you there that was the promise they should have just believed it but don't let cnn don't let everything else say man fox news whatever amen they're both right the same thing they don't let nothing else amen to take take your eyes off of the word amen i don't care what biden's doing but let biden do whatever he wants to do kamala harris i don't care what such and such says about you got to wear two masks or that's fine you just concentrate on the word fauci said this i don't care you concentrate on the word amen such and such said this i don't care you stay with the word because the word told me to come amen you stay with the word the word will fight for you how many love the lord tonight amen amen let's stand to our feet i said tonight
