if you need it just don't use that one because i couldn't get it to work okay we'll get it worked on all right so that's psalms 8 genesis 1 revelations 1. okay any other announcements we need to make i don't okay heavenly father we thank you for your loving your grace father we thank you that you are god and you change not and as we read lord this morning the labbies had said about you you're sweet lord and we love you we love you very much father and we thank you for everything we ask you to just come among us now this afternoon and speak to our hearts and our lives we believe lord this is the day and the hour of the manifestation of your person of your being among us in the way that's to be in the end time and that's forward is father something let's look forward to because we spoke of it for all these years and we've tried to encourage people to believe it and to recognize who we are lord we love you and we thank you guide us now as we read your scripture you have your way with each and every one of us in jesus name amen in psalms 8 what is man that dark mindful of him and the son of man that thou visited him for thou has made him a little lower than the angels and has crowned him with glory and honor all right we know who that is the lord jesus christ is the son of man okay but then speaking of the bride becoming christ made manifest look how that ties together thou made us him to have dominion over the works of thy hands that has put all things under his feet we know that all sheep and oxen yea and the beasts of the field the fowl of the air fish of the sea and whatsoever passes through the paths of the sea they are in the control of the son of man okay genesis 1 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the file of the iron over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image and the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish which the word replenish there means to feel it doesn't mean that there was people back before then and something happened to them and then you got to replenish the original says to feel the hebrew word in our heart and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth okay revelations then we go to revelations one 12 and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candle sticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the pouch with a golden girdle before you're seated then let's read revelations 10 1 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was it where the sun and his feet were as pillars of fire brother branham says that the seventh angel is on earth at the time of this coming that's right all right so you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word you'll see in a moment when we get back to it what i'm talking about on the revelations 10. okay now we got over to the point this morning of covering the uh we're talking about we've been talking about the uh things showing who the bride is and what god thinks of her and how he declares her in the word you know for the time and as i tried to cover this morning see i believe then that there must be a word for ever age but there also must be a people there must be a prophet to bring that word to the people and that's why brother brown would call luther wesley and then he would say the great prophet sent there on azusa street and there would be a message each one of those angels would be declared as being a prophet and there would be a message and a people to live that message all right and i believe that's where we're at we're in the time of where the the life angels message has been declared we're not looking for another messenger to come to the gentile dispensation and then that way we know that the hour is at hand and surely we ought to be able to believe it by now after some 40 years 50 years after the prophet has said these things and we're we're really you know if it's not then i ask you and i the question what will happen what is it going to be is time just going to fade out and and we got to just just be gone we just all die my brother has that philosophy that the end of the world comes every day to a person who passes away you don't realize that's what you're thinking that it's just we're passing away the end of the world's coming we're just you know doing and uh he said sure the bible's written to where you can take it to where it would mean this or where it would mean that but said nobody knows that's what it means well we've had a prophet to tell us that's what it means all right so when he told us that's what it means then we can rejoice in thinking about what it means all right see then we got down we covered this morning or reviewed just coming back and quoting about the bride would be the fullness of the godhead bodily he'd be dwelling in his church here in the end time we gave these quotes of what paragraph 146 of christ of mr god revealed paragraph 159 of of uh i believe that's the same one and then we got down to the mighty god unveiled where the prophet was covering that god in in man now it was god in man now it's god in men the fullness of the godhead bodily in his entire church he gets over to god's only provided place of worship no leaven among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you lean not to your own understanding he covers that god isn't complete without you all right see then we got on down to kind of ending this morning of how that who is this son of man and we went through it's the rising of the sun paragraph 93 where it says in the beginning was the word right you know who is the son of man the word made flesh amen now analyze a point this is a little if you're talking about a son a son uh when it infers or shows that you mean there's a father all right and that means a son is an offspring or someone come forth from right now when you say son all right so then this one that we're talking about had to come down so that's the only way you could refer to him when jesus would talk about himself being the son of man he was an offspring not another person but to sign god made manifest in human flesh called the son all right signifying the body would have a beginning all right but the god within her is real and no such thing all right so then we read in the psalmist that what is man the dark mindful of him or the son of man you know see then it would mean that god would be living in flesh right son of offspring or something come forth man amen all right so then you would have to come down to a human uh element or thoughts to bring in the word man and i know it work uses the word man or or the word man can be used as mankind because that's that's just terminology in english and i'm poor on that but i do know that's what it means when the bible would say their in genesis let us make man it doesn't mean just all the men was made and women would make you know like that it means mankind right so then that would bring it down to showing us and that's why we read the scriptures as we did to show that in saying what jesus was almighty god made manifest in human flesh that's why he would be called a son not that he had a beginning as a as god he was god all the time but he had a beginning of earthly element time all right a creation all right and that he would be the son of man and remember we covered son of man a few weeks ago and brother branham what was it was it christ the mystery where he says it but anyhow he said that's the only way he could be father that's right was to be the son of man but then he's talking about a group of people that would be like him or be him may manifest in another form and that's all i'm talking about a bride and we are the bride of christ all right then the complete church together makes the fullness of the godhead body amen that shouldn't be any problem with our understanding all right see then it would come over into being made manifest remember we covered there's a word forever age but there's somebody to make that manifest right the prophet has to bring it someone to make it manifest all right the prophet has brought the message in the end but there's got to be somebody to make it manifest right right i mean that's going to be somewhere why can't we contend we're part of it all right i mean that's just simple language that's not a big thing uh you know if i was a baptist today i wouldn't be scared to say or sorry to say or afraid to say or ashamed to say that that i was a baptist what a problem would you i mean i'm a human i don't say i'm a monkey i mean act like one they look like one but i'm still a human being all right but do you understand the connection what i'm saying son of man would mean the word was going to be in flesh in a man upon the earth and that was jesus christ now you put that christ into the church and what have you got you got jesus christ made manifest so when you started your church ages right which is in the book of revelations so then what i've said all along should be dawning on you that the book of revelations is showing god made manifest but it's showing where he's at right amen when we leave here he goes with 144 000. he's being made manifest to them right that's right then why can't we believe who we are and it's not who we are it is who has made us what we are someone said we are his people the sheep of his pasture when are we going to start saying that that's right and it's like i said now raise your hand you believe you're born again i believe i'm born again he believed you you believe you're proud of living bride you're going to heaven the rapture i don't really know maybe you might say in a way well you're denying that you're never born again he's coming back on after the one that's inside of us this just rides alone that's why it's got to be changed right would you see what i'm saying i've heard people say i believe in that adoption but said that stature of pretty man's deep it's the same thing that's right amen but yet see we try to make it and really we show what we believe that's it amen that's right right like and i'm not asking you to do it like i said if i'd say raise your hand if you believe in everybody building on this shoot your hand i mean you shouldn't go i can't believe it no it ought to be an instantaneous right and you say are you going to be in the rapture that ought to be instantaneous and what that big word means all together is one thing in a hurry and we shouldn't have any stuttering about it that's right we should believe it then the prophet has recovered this morning it's a rise in the sun who is it son of man it goes right back to john 1. in the beginning was the word the only thing it comes down to verse 14 later on right and the word was made flesh why can't we believe we are the word made flesh right that's right amen yes sir i go to that flop across me well i just don't see it i'm sorry you know what you'd be in the days of the lord jesus you would be an unbeliever you know what you'd be in the days of paul an unbeliever you know what you've been in the days of luther an unbeliever you know what you are now an unbeliever but i'm not trying to make us something right i'm trying to declare what the prophet has already said we are giving us the scriptures it says we are right yes sir why can't we believe that that's that's all folks that's you know you may differ with me in every form of what you think but just remember i got one thing in mind is to get you and i to the place that we ain't worried about obama and we ain't worried about all these other things because it won't have nothing to do with us it ain't gonna put me in the rapture because this pope would die and get one out of the united states and ain't gonna put me in the rapture i thought that rapture and faith would lay in the message that's right i didn't know it late in natural events that can be questioned like i told you the other day wearing all that people talk talking about now the blood moon well brother random where it says the moon will turn to blood he said i can show you when that's already happened right now i can't show you where it's already happened because i don't know okay he said there were seven church ages in the old testament i can't show you where they're at because he didn't tell me now he told some marion and him shouting singing going down through there after they crossed into the promised land or some of that cats you know well that one that's those things we know all right but now watch he gets in to recover off of proving his word who is this son of man he said it is the word well that's all i'm concerned with is getting you and i to believe the word we're reading amen i mean suppose we take a little tour and we would all go to some foreign country anywhere you know and uh they got a sign over here that says all u.s citizens go this way but they got a sign over here it says shortcut go this way let's go this way no no no no you're going to know that something's wrong and where it says all u.s citizens you go that away why because you're not ashamed to be called an american citizen right well why not why be ashamed of being called the bride of christ the prophet i believe it see a book right where he says i'll call you bride why be ashamed of being the bride if not what are you that's right well i think i am a hope i am maybe a ham will only date or might be i am you know but see there must be someone to make manifest or alive the word of the age that's why the prophet said the bride is to vindicate malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelation 10 7 vindicate what is vindicate well dead raised it healed me he said anointed ones would do that it's somebody to believe it and just walk into it and let god just make it manifest right amen that's all church that i've ever tried to do is to believe that all right but we're talking about the son of man we spoke of that as that jesus christ was the son of man the son of god the son of david and brother said i am not the son of man he said i'm a son of man that jesus is the son of man the son of god the son of david all right now to make him any more than that we would be running into the wrong thing right that's right so we're only trying to believe who we are okay we got down and we started reading some things but before we do i want you to i want to remind you of this and i don't mind preaching more on it i i got past all that you know i just love the word but what about a prophet that could put the scriptures and things in this place right to tell us the things and now that he would go back to genesis 1 and show that that man in genesis 1 is not a physical man right that's right genesis 2 is the physical man genesis 1 is the spiritual man all right we're not talking about we are the physical lord jesus christ no no we are him made manifest which would mean he's in another form called a bride all right see then reading it that way didn't come into revelations 1 12 and 13. and where that we went through and we've been through it over and over john turns to see the voice the prophet said while we're not a denomination he sees bride then he covers that gird about to pounce with a golden girdle he says that's not masculine that's feminist then he covers that we are his shoulders we are the the government is upon his shoulder amen that's why he's girded about the pouch not around the waist waist with service you know servant all right and then we go over into and i'm just making our fights run through we go over into revelations two and three and and we study the church ages and what was for each age and how marvelous those things the prophet could lay that age right down with those ages that even with a little bit of understanding we have of of history that we could look back and see luther in his age and wesley and his age you know and follow it and then come out into chapter 3 there are about verse 14 and it comes out to be the beginning of the creation of god and brother brown said he's the beginning of the creation of god and he said we're the continuation of that creation not another creation god made manifest in human beings well i i can kind of see a little bit back there brother dale and you know kind of some of my ages but you talk about son of man over here i normally see it brother branham well i would remind you that in the book of revelations there's a chapter four that one man would go up that's right it would represent the entire bride right as a rapture amen amen it reminds you of those signs well see then you could see that we have our place in position yes that we are in the seventh church age no now brother that we're not in the age we're called out there never was a bride in that age show me any bride in an age the new birth calls you out of the age it don't matter what age you're in luther west you're calling out of the age into the kingdom of god amen we'll see the later seeing age is still here it's going on and we're going over and connect to the millennium you know your profit covers because there's not another gap age in there somewhere else every night all right but see then we can look at that and see how things would lay so close together and then the prophet would talk about this being revelation 1 12 and 13 being the son of man in bride form in bride form look at what he's been shown ass that's why it says one like unto the son of man and then he goes over to revelations 10. and we get over to revelations 10 there's an angel standing there with a rainbow over his head chapter 10 verse 1. we read chapter verse 7 or 4 but we don't hardly deal with verse 1. all right but he gets in the seal book in the breach between the church ages and the seals program 29 he's covering the thunders and things of it's the time for it and i saw another another mighty angel come down from heaven glow with a cloud and a rainbow upon his head brother says the seventh angel is on earth at the time of this coming run it in your computer sometime time of this coming and you'll see the quote i'll be glad to give it to you but he said if you notice that's christ because he in the old testament was called the angel of the covenant and he's directly coming to the jew jews now for the church is finished see all right and let's face it where the sun his feet is filler to fire if you remember that angel in revelations 1. he's talking about revelations 10 1 right right come on that's what's in revelations 10 1. one with a rainbow around his head he said you remember that angel in revelation one same thing angel is a messenger and he's a messenger to israel the church has been raptured so you now are fixing to be raptured he comes for his church program 44 of the breach it's a book of redemption from god all the mysteries at this time should be finished at the sounding of this messenger now here's the angel on earth and another mighty angel come down see this angel was an earthly angel are you reading it but here comes one down from heaven a rainbow covenant see only christ it could be just exactly like it was in revelations first chapter standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks so he makes revelations 1 and revelations 10 1 the same am i reading so then he goes on over to let's see souls that are in prison now go ahead with the next one i didn't know they was going to get up with me today with these i just kind of don't quote it in they'll get it in a second paragraph 156 sold in prison 1963 right is it 63 yeah 63 11 10 morning notice it was to be the seventh angel's message that was to reveal the seventh the seven seals revelations 10 7. now you'll find it see now watch it and he saw this angel come down put his foot on the land and on the sea that's revelations 10 1. that was christ yes had a rainbow over his head notice him you'll find him in revelations one again with the rainbow over his head look upon his jasper and sardis and so forth here he come put his hand one foot on land want to see it was christ right yes put in revelations 10 in revelations 1. together and he's showing the same christ amen all right see we want to go over to 10 4 10 7. especially 10-4 where we can what are the thunders brother brown says it's the voice of god when the seal broke right that's right i think that's 158 of the seal book i'm not certain i'll be glad to find it for you if you don't know where it's at but you see what i'm talking about yes we don't put all of those things together i wasn't the one that said that you'll find him in revelations 1. i wasn't the one that was reading before now it would be revelations one the same thing see we're looking and wanting to make it one thing when the very purpose of sending a prophet was to introduce the word amen to the bride amen is that true yes the very purpose yes was to bring the word that the bride could receive it and become the word amen that's why now you're going to differ with me but that's why when the prophet was here god didn't come down and end it all right there that's right you want these quotes right around and said he had a lot of work to do talking about jesus we said he left some for us to do all right when that work's done it'll be over with yeah but it'll be over when the bride realizes who she is now i'm gonna drop say this and drop back see then when she realized who she is she's gonna make him manifest but i want to say it this way we think it's got to be healings and signs and wonders and speaking it and saying thus saith the lord are doing this the anointing once can do every bit of that that's right yep that's right the prophet he says it's the word that's right amen that's right he said satan can impersonate every gift that's right right right but said he can't bring it word by word he can't do it so then which is the most important amen that's right the signs and the wonders that they can do or the word that we can receive and try to become and to try to become that you know just america got two fine boys sitting there have you wrote them kind of a book to live by you know i mean the day that's born you hand them the book you say this is what you're supposed to do boys no no no no no you just kind of try to instruct them in life right god don't beat us to death that's right about our beings the kids don't have to call me every day and say daddy i love you yeah we do a lot but they don't have to do that for me to realize they're my kids that's true all right you'll find out later on about the boys you know then when they start getting goody goody lovey-dovey there's something wrong you got something in mind you're fixing to get it or they're fixing to want it right you think god don't know about us come on okay let's get on with the message now because we got over here and i want to reread some of these and then go on and finish it all right so let's go to number seven on our quotes that's kind of where we ended up with and we will try to start from there because i want you to see what it's talking about all right doctor asked me the other day i had to go for checking up and he's he's still preaching yeah kind of croaking a little bit you know but i'm still doing it but listen to what he said we read this this morning but remember we'll just shortcut and try to get some of that so the other bit the coming of the son of man and it was in the days of a lot so will it be god living in human flesh moving among us okay we've seen that in brother branham thank god i mean we wasn't there to see it but some of you saw it all right well look god living in human flesh moving among us in the form of his church in the holy spirit performing the signs in his church number eight christ is the mystery of god revealed paragraph 4 57 and as it was in the days of noah so shall our lives and there's a lot when the modern billy graham and oral roberts we look at them we see them we recognize their day but we're going to recognize ours right one angel standing we've seen this you know the angel stayed back a messenger with abraham and he stood with his back and all the things he called him elohim showing who it was we've seen that god in him it will be manifested in his bride in the last days all right now going to number nine sirs we would see jesus 64. jesus was god in flesh and jesus and if jesus is in you tonight it's still god manifests himself in the last days the son of man revealing himself in his church making himself known son of man being revealed in the last days as it was in the days of sodom all right number 10 christ revealed christ is identified the same in all generations verb 209 there was elohim manifested in the flesh that had ate the flesh of a cave drinking the milk from the cow and eat bread why should we wonder about god in the lifestyle right jesus said notice as it days and the days when the son of man shall be revealed being revealed in the last days it'll be like it was in the days of sodom god manifested in his church when are we going to realize that the human beings revealing himself see in human flesh like he was then all right number 11 a trial 64. now jesus never said in the days when the son of god would be revealed he was revealed in the church ages son of god revealed in churches but the church put him out they put out god in the ages all right now they want him there to heal the sick save the souls right right but they don't want him as god over their lives so look when they put him out then he would be revealed as son of man when the son of man is being revealed god manifested amongst the human beings like it was then son of man prophetic why would you argue then when the prophet would say that even azusa street the prophet came into zeus austria he said another great prophet but brother so and so said raise your right hand everybody raise your right hand hey brother raise his left hand because he can get the message you know what how do you know that's your right hand you've been taught that's your right hand isn't it kind of funny that we're standing here today looking up and they're on the other side of the world looking up explain that we used to thank his kids the ones on the other side of the earth and slanted eyes because it's hanging upside down let's see we've been told but they was told he was listening to brother brown the other night how many times he told about george washington's day he had pneumonia i think it was you know what he done he pulled his toenails and bled him a pint of blood the worst thing they could have done how would you like to go back to that oh we don't believe that we've advanced above that well why can't we advance in the gospel exactly that's right look we've been through these and i put them back in or you with your notes would have them they don't have to pull these up but we've been through this they brought around them in patma's vision they can put them up here unless you read them if you want to page 49 of patmos vision turn to see the voice john does not say that he turned to see the one whose voice he heard but turn to see the voice well i like that turn to see the voice the voice and the person are the same are one and the same jesus is the word and he reads in the midst of the seven golden council like the son of man what is one life who was this his bride one like him no so if revelation 1 and revelation 10 is the same then you see in the bride in both places and remember the seventh angel is on earth at the time of this coming he said it's not a man said it's a woman heard about the past now he goes on down to why we're not a denomination he turned to see the one like unto the son of man slow standing close how was it it was a bride standing in the candlesticks drawn out how much greater could that be than what we would read let's go to 14 we'll start reading there restoration of the bride tree paragraph 496 and what's the evening light come out for what is even light for to restore you you get it congregation says amen any light is for the same purpose that the morning light was for to restore what was cut down by the dark ages too wrong god is going to restore by shining forth the evening light what restore the whole word of god again the full manifestation of christ in his church why can't we believe that everything he did just exactly the way he did it it would be again in the evening light see what i mean but it was but i don't see it put together around the world today and you'll find the ministry of jesus christ the sick being healed the dead being raised things are happening that's right but because you don't see it with your little obiti eyes come on what's it for to restore all right let's read fast all right remember what i'm talking about i'm talking about the son of man the word made flesh to be revealed in a bright form called his church right once now what he says it is here in the mighty god unveiled before us paragraph 147 and jesus said as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be at the coming son of man deity failed again in human flesh uh yeah that's brother branham all right i've solved the case i thought to speak about that brother branham is a part of the body of christ he was glad to be associated in that form yeah we want to put him up above the bride of christ now we'll read in a minute we read it the other day or this morning his purpose was to reveal the word right now watch what he says deity veiled again in human flesh remember he's talking about son of man remember jesus didn't say when the son of god is being revealed in luke 17 30 17th chapter i believe in about the 20th and the 21st verse which is 17 30. somewhere along there he said and when the son of man is being revealed the son of man back in in the church again back in the church again revealed in human beings not just one man human beings not son of god but the son of man again back in his church again in the last days we find that in the promises all right go ahead modern events made clear by prophecy program 168. remember i didn't want to get in the church is he the individual he couldn't get in the church and him locked out only then only organization of all of them is this church age that he was on the outside all right what's he getting at stumbling with his words what's he getting at church being outside put out refuse rejected because he was only manifested in temporarily in the other churches in the form of justification so forth but here in the age that he's coming now the full manifestation of the vindication of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever oh i admit we got a lot of impersonations we just examine it and see what it is watch now go to the next one this is taken from questions and answers 64 paragraph 91 read all up above coming down that's the question he's talking about the new verse so he said absolutely i just explained that this morning the same on the same thing you got to have all stages you're begotten of the spirit just like a baby's begotten into the wound of a mother but not born until they receive the holy ghost that's right you're born then you're not converted you're in the process of being converted until that time now do you get the background of what he's using he's explaining the new birth but how it transpires right right now watch that's the reason that all these great mysteries could not be given to luther could not be given to wesley could not be given to the age that has just passed by us the pentecostal age why it wasn't time they were only begotten now the person of christ himself these son of man you understand revealing himself in human flesh it could not have come till now is that blunt enough could not come until now look the next this is the message the harvest time 64. paragraph 354 no matter and in that day luke 17 20 i believe it is jesus said when the son of man is being revealed not man the son of man now are you falling back not man is your mind remember what we read of genesis 1 26 let us make man not man every man is not involved in this all mankind is not involved in this that we're talking about special designation of himself when the son of man is being revealed not man the son of man not an organization the son of man the word living itself again among the people see the word itself made flesh in you you are a reflection of this hour the message yes reflection of it in other words what's he saying somebody you're living it so you live again live the life that was in jesus christ you're in the presence of the son then to the what happens to it what happens to that church finally listen that shark pulls away from that wheat now are we back over to what son of man drive when it begins to be manifested what happened the life that was in the shock went on out in the wheat the light won't change the carriers change they denominate see the blades the tassel the shook but the wheat can't change it's got to be a ministry just exactly on the word like he was on the word and like the first church was on the word spirit-filled word fed not denomination say it not that got to be a ministry just exactly like it was go ahead this is number 19. this day this scripture is fulfilled paragraph 48 could not be could i could i not say this if i had just been on my toes see the brother prophesied when he said to me they did this day watch what he did right after the reading of that scripture in the days when the son of man not a man not a human being the son of man will reveal himself among his people again now if it's one man then you got him wrong here go ahead this day this promise of this hour that we're now living here is fulfilled before our very eyes go ahead one in a million 65 paragraph 10. and he is supposed to according to the scriptures return to us in this last days in this type of ministry that will be after the baptism of the holy spirit and speaking in tongues and divine healing and so forth these things the capping of the pentecostal message is what we're speaking of today all right not capping tongues about talking about a message this ministry of the christ himself impersonated among his people with the very same things he did when he was here on earth in his body the bride which is part of him doing the same things as husband and wife are king and queen just before the marriage ceremony okay go ahead we got only a couple more three or four more spiritual food and due season paragraph 163 1965. that's the thing right there that's the ones secrets they organized and see and was completely out of the will of god and that will be exposed in the last days and lead to people not to a creed or a denomination but back to the true word and the true word will come to a certain group of people and the son of man will reveal himself in the midst of them the same yesterday today and forever all right look the next one the only ones the end time prayer of 165. it's the grain of wheat itself the son of man will be made manifest the grain of wheat will come back to itself again the son of man in the last days now how long do we spend on the grain of wheat and how much all right there will come false impersonations of it in the last days that'll almost deceive the elected if possible look at their organizational shucks pulling away now okay go ahead modern events made clear by prophecy paragraph 2 33 jesus when he come he was to be a prophet that's right and today before jesus comes again the full manifestation of the person of jesus christ is to be manifested in flesh now do you believe that yes no i don't see you bible said i believe to see it didn't say i see to believe i believe to see open your eyes the full manifestation of the person of jesus christ is to be manifested in flesh think of it jesus said as it was in the days of sodom so she'll be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed what is revealed you know what is revealed unfolded made known the secret had been brought forth revealed in the day that the son of man will be revealed the world will be in a sodomite condition we've got it haven't we yeah and how many believes that it's in a sort of my condition and that's exactly right now look where it's sitting now going to the next one leadership 1965 program 142. now to refuse that person that's doing the calling christ no matter if you're pentecostal methodist lutheran whatever you are you got it this age nothing against them not at all but in this age now you've got to accept like they did in that age so each age accepted for their age right that's what was the trouble luther he accepted it and the people become it that's right all right now you've got to accept like they did in that age the person of christ which is the word now the last one so modern events made clear by prophecy paragraph 57 this book is a book of prophecy it's believers are commanded to honor it and to read it and believe it's author for every word that's written in there must come to pass everything that's been promised has to come to piss because it is jesus christ in each age the same yesterday it was jesus was in noah it was jesus christ and moses it was jesus christ and david it was jesus christ and joseph jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and it's jesus christ among his people today doing the things that he promised he would do in this age it's jesus christ but do you see it church the son of man is the bride made manifest the word for the age that we're living in this is not for everybody this is not for everybody now listen to my wording please it's not for everybody that claims to believe the message a lot of people read this message you turn on your radio and listen to some of these preachers and you can almost give the book they're reading out of it right you know all right they know about this message like i said this morning they pick on brother branham about dates and times and seasons but even they won't pick on the gift that was in his life they know they can't argue with that but listen church god has made himself known in each age and there's been a messenger for that age and a people to live that message and there's been a messenger in this age and the people to live the message not to just go to church and be good it's to go to church to learn to hear the truth and then some of you come to me and you'll say brother dale i've learned more here in a short time and i've learned that don't exalt me that makes me cry you know why because the places you come from and the opportunity to hear this message the way that i've taught it right but because of my stand to believe and lay on they can only attack quotes like a sister is telling me the other day that some people she talked to said brother dale believes in a seven year tribulation he never taught nothing that way i've taught what the prophet said that just seven years after the rapture they don't believe that organized religion taught seven years tribulation they think brother branham was teaching that because we saying seven years after the rapture but see he said there's no such thing he said it was three and a half years of jesus ministry back there and three and a half over here he said it's only three and a half years of tribulation that's over here and the bride don't go through the tribulation she goes in the rapture well why can't we believe that and say he's coming back after a bride a word-born bride well brother dale what do you mean word born people that are birthed by the word sisters ask me a question and i'm going to say it but she's asked me a question a good many times because of what she's doing he is taking the messages i preached in 1982 and topping them up and she's up to the fifth seal topping them up brother mark is paying for her to do that because he wanted it the way that i taught it all right and uh she's asked me some questions and sometimes they just put these and it's not because they don't understand what i say it it's because they don't understand what i said right so instead of trying to write it down and leave it alone dots you know i said that's okay just don't put all them snow in them skull bones and you know because it means a cuss word you know all right but she's mentioning it to me something i made years ago during that seal i said i believe that a man can have multiple wives and wait on the tape then said daddy watch it well she don't know how to write that down because she's afraid she writes it down the way i said it that everybody all thanking believing in all this he said why haven't you explained it to her if she's heard all them tapes and copied them off that's you here this day that's fine she already know what to talk i believe a man can have more than one wife not cut the tape off now and you got it you all messed up i believe a woman can have more than one husband only problem is he got to be dead right i mean if the husband's dead she can marry again if he dies she marry again he said well why didn't you explain that to her how are you going to explain anything man's wife dies and he marries again not american he's got more than one wife right come on so what's wrong with the statement i didn't say it was okay to have more than one y the only difference is i'll tell you what i believe i believe what the prophet says i believe a man can put in wife his wife for certain things and marry again well in god he may not have but one but in mankind he's got more than one right right multiple you don't have to put the x's in because you don't understand what i say but i know what the public will get now get that look he said it okay i stand behind what i say he said well why didn't you explain those things maybe it's not meant to be explained you know maybe some things are meant to believe and walk into them i mean come on i've been here with you all these years most a lot of you brother colley brother daugherty knew 1972 when they started 71 i guess the end of it and then you'd read the newspaper that samuel dale is caught with a woman in a motel it wasn't his wife you mean after all these years you're going to get on the telephone call everybody like that right here in the newspaper i know dog he's going to fall i just felt that i just had a feeling that one of these days he was gonna fall you know that's exactly what 98 of the people would do but why can't you be like sister gayle one time when they told her certain things about me and she said samuel dale don't believe that she put herself on the line that i didn't believe it i appreciate the brother he and i had difference in doctrine but he heard some brothers talking about me one day and he walked up and he said i'll tell you right real quick samuel dale don't believe that i said thank you brother he had that much confidence that i didn't believe that listen church this is not about a man about a point it's about a people a people who can believe who they are and now quote brother dick there if they come up with a doctrine and prove that brother brown has been married 10 times or something how many of you could say thank god i heard the word no matter if the man was wrong i heard about jesus something that all you lily white two shoes so when i get around to it then you know i don't believe he was married 10 times right because my basis is in the word all right but you see why can't we put everything and leave right around him in a human element it can make flips of the tongue and different things that people can use against him and we just go right on down the road then he brought me to jesus he brought me to a revelation of god that no man was ever able to bring me to i used to question him in the baptist church about god in his doings i told you before a man said you need to go to a pentecostal church because i was questioning about god you know and i believe that god was real why can't we be that now church but just accept what he says we are and believe it but you know there's other side of it that a lot of people are waiting for some word from him to let them know where they are well the message and the prophet has already told us who we are and what we're doing you know but yet why would we have to wait until the prophet would tell us what we are why can't we believe jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and thank god for the revealed word the church the first message i preached right here in this church in 1971 july 4th was going beyond man's camp that was the title of the message and i said then i said folks don't get upset at us because we're going home if you want to settle down and just cabbage down and sit down and wait that's fine but we're just wanting to move on with the lord amen why wouldn't we want that you know what i told you i went and preached for a man one time and i preached justification same case and baptism and holy ghost and he got upset at me and i said why he said you taught them just because the same thing imagine the holy ghost that you needed to seek god i said yes sir he said i had them built on the word and you got them to seek in god i said i apologize for preaching something in your church that you don't agree with but i'll never apologize for trying to get your church or anybody from seeking god i will not apologize for that because how can you be anything if you're not seeking god how can you get anything from god if you're not seeking him the bible says seek want to seek god how or while he shall be found or something to that degree no stand come on brother but i believe the bride of jesus christ will be the word made manifest and she will finish the things that was left and she will be that word made flesh and that word might flesh will be the son of man deity veiled in human flesh i don't make this nothing that makes a great god that we serve one who has tried to get us to see what else could you and i want to believe god's word we've got the messages and witness among us witnesses among us that seen the prophet in the preaching and seen the dead raised in the sick healed seen thus saith the lord and seen it made manifest witnesses still living i honor that i tell everybody i got people in my church that was dire when the prophet these things took place i'm glad of that see personal witness is it we can get them in the pulpit let them testify about what they saw god in human flesh manifesting himself through a man that would say thus saith the lord and god would honor it but yet he was pointing all that time to try to get the church to believe who they are the word made flesh the son of man what do we got brother 152 152. anybody has a name holy praise the lord praise the lord anybody have a name right feeding on the word today like to a man no i believe god true the man is going to speak to us yeah man god will use someone to and speak close but that's not deity i'll be right here is i'll be right here i'll be right here sitting in the word listening to him declare what he has made me what he's made me then no matter what goes i can't pay y'all right i can't fail but i'm dependent on him praise the lord do you believe it here's what he has done this thing ain't god good and then we'll go anybody have a need let's just sing in the movie that's what we are remember to pray for brother claude coming next weekend looking forward that's what we are today brother aaron and i were talking today and brother douglas had sent him a note something about walking with god i don't remember exactly when i kind of give him a phrase and send it back not exactly like this but you know and listen to what i'm saying it's hard for me to walk with the lord now you know i'm fixing to say something else right you're waiting i told him i said you tell brother douglas my problem is that god can't walk as slow as my pace that's why i have trouble walking with god he can't walk as slow as my pace is but i still love to walk with him you know what i found out years ago you know they got to saying in america i just want to keep up with the joneses i don't mean that round because that's what they use you know you know how to keep up with the joneses just stand still because they're going to come back right they're going to slide back down to where you are so just stand still and let them come back and you can walk with the joneses well i hope god will come by sometime slow enough to sit down and talk with me a little bit you love him father we thank you lord we pray that what we said has been worthy through this series about these things lord we pray that it stirred up the people's mind a little about you and what you're trying to do lord looking forward then to questions and answers comments and things from the people to see what they believe lord we believe your word there's none of us worthy to be anything but yet you have made us what we are you've given us your word to walk in and we thank you as we go on our way home we ask you to just be with everybody and take care of everybody give a safe journey knowing that as many miles will be covered this afternoon just going home many dangers and many things could happen to many people but yet you're always there just got each one of us we love you we thank you you truly are as abby said you're sweet to be what you are to reveal yourself to us unworthy as we are we get you to open the word unto us to allow us to see this end time blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness the prophet said it's a blessing just to hunger but you went on to save for they shall be filled we love you dismiss the people now on the way home lord forgive our sins guide us in jesus name you dismiss yeah that's
