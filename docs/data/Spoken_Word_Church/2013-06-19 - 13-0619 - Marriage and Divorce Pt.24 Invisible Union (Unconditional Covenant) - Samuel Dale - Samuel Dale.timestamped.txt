[4:07] romans
[4:09] 7
[4:11] no you're not breathing for i speak to
[4:13] them that know the law
[4:15] have the law had dominion over a man as
[4:17] long as he liveth
[4:19] for the woman which hath and husband is
[4:20] bound by the law to her husband
[4:23] so long as he liveth
[4:25] but if the husband be dead she is loose
[4:27] from the law of her husband now remember
[4:29] he's talking about law and grace
[4:31] illustrating it with marriage and
[4:33] divorce to bring it to an understanding
[4:36] to show and then showing where the bride
[4:38] of christ
[4:40] and where she stands
[4:42] so then if while her husband lives she'd
[4:44] be married to another man
[4:46] she shall be called an adulteress but if
[4:49] her husband be dead he is she is free
[4:51] from that law
[4:53] so that she is no adulteress though she
[4:55] be married to another man or for my
[4:58] brethren you also are become dead to the
[5:00] law
[5:00] by the body of christ that you should be
[5:02] married to another even to him who is
[5:05] raised from the dead
[5:06] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[5:08] god
[5:09] and when we were in the flesh the
[5:11] motions of sin which were by the law
[5:14] did work in our members to bring forth
[5:16] fruit unto death
[5:18] but now we are delivered from the law
[5:20] that being dead wherein we were held
[5:22] that we should serve in newness of
[5:24] spirit
[5:25] and not
[5:27] in the oldness
[5:28] of the letter let's go over now to
[5:32] this little scripture that we have here
[5:34] to tie together
[5:35] in our messages and what we've been
[5:37] doing
[5:39] so that would be first john two
[5:41] one and two
[5:43] my little children
[5:44] these things right on to you
[5:47] that you send not
[5:49] if a man is sin
[5:50] we have an advocate with the father
[5:53] jesus christ the righteous
[5:55] and he is the perpetuation
[5:57] for our sins
[5:59] and not for ours only but also for the
[6:02] sins
[6:02] of the world you may be seated the lord
[6:05] add his blessing to the reading
[6:08] of the word
[6:10] now
[6:13] i want to
[6:14] just try to
[6:16] get something to make sure you
[6:18] understand
[6:20] what i'm saying
[6:21] and then we'll continue on to the
[6:23] thought in
[6:24] to law and grace
[6:26] but
[6:29] i believe that we need an understanding
[6:31] by revelation
[6:33] and that's my thoughts
[6:35] you know
[6:36] we can read something and say we
[6:38] understand this
[6:39] we can say well i believe that
[6:42] i believe that a long time but has it
[6:44] really been revealed to us
[6:48] now that's the point
[6:50] has it really been revealed to us
[6:53] how that
[6:56] the new birth
[6:59] makes us a child of god
[7:04] is that really just dawned on us that's
[7:06] right
[7:08] making us a child of god
[7:11] now we've covered we've been through the
[7:12] scriptures and the things of the
[7:14] prophet's message and and trying to
[7:16] cover it how that we were born kin folks
[7:19] to the devil
[7:20] according to the book of ruth
[7:22] had one closer kin to us than
[7:25] than christ and those things had to be
[7:27] dealt with that were that
[7:29] god had to come himself
[7:31] to give his own life
[7:34] and to dwell in you and i
[7:36] right
[7:37] what a wonderful situation to give
[7:40] a people
[7:41] the new
[7:42] birth eternal life in your soul
[7:46] making that soul just as eternal
[7:49] and just as perfect
[7:51] as god is right
[7:53] now that's a wonderful situation that's
[7:56] that's worthy of all thoughts and ideas
[7:59] and praise and and glory and everything
[8:03] to be able to be thinking about it
[8:06] how that what god has done for you and i
[8:08] am
[8:10] you know
[8:11] in our new birth
[8:13] all right
[8:14] see then
[8:15] coming to see that it was grace
[8:19] that brought that to pisces
[8:23] we talk about abraham having an
[8:24] unconditional covenant
[8:27] you see grace was even back before
[8:29] abraham
[8:32] he said but now well no grace was before
[8:34] the foundation of the world
[8:36] because the bible doesn't say
[8:38] that he wrote the names in the book of
[8:41] life when abraham received the message
[8:43] of the unconditional covenant
[8:47] it was grace before anything ever came
[8:50] into being
[8:52] and that's what i've tried to get us to
[8:53] see
[8:54] on the
[8:56] the new birth and then on the marriage
[8:58] and divorce situation of life
[9:01] is to see that it takes grace
[9:05] and truly it's amazing grace
[9:08] grace grace as zechariah says
[9:11] you know
[9:12] to see that a people can be made totally
[9:15] free
[9:18] and then then comes into being the
[9:20] scripture see he that the son is set
[9:22] free
[9:24] is free indeed
[9:28] now but we know and realize that
[9:31] there's a journey of mankind upon the
[9:34] earth
[9:35] that
[9:36] we are the problem we're the trouble
[9:39] you know we caused to do it we failed
[9:44] but yet depending upon god to come down
[9:47] and by grace
[9:51] but it's see we we talk a lot about
[9:53] grace on the side of the
[9:56] armenian calvinism you know the
[9:58] different things
[10:00] but
[10:03] see grace
[10:06] is what god does for you and i yeah
[10:08] right
[10:10] everything we have or do
[10:13] is a product of grace
[10:16] your home you live in
[10:18] you car you drive your food you ate
[10:20] today
[10:22] and that food being not killing you
[10:26] is a product of grace
[10:30] right around said my whole makeup
[10:32] is grace
[10:35] all right
[10:36] but now remember
[10:38] the bible says
[10:40] not that we're just saved by grace
[10:45] but it says through faith
[10:50] it's not just a a product to just well
[10:53] it's for everybody
[10:55] you know
[10:57] it's not for everybody right
[11:00] because everybody won't receive it
[11:03] it's for everybody that will receive it
[11:08] and that way the thing for him can't say
[11:10] why did you make me this away
[11:15] because god never made us a sinner
[11:18] but by grace he came down and paid the
[11:20] price
[11:23] all right
[11:26] and he gave us
[11:29] an unconditional covenant
[11:32] amen
[11:36] well then
[11:37] see you would automatically say well
[11:38] then if it's unconditional
[11:42] oh
[11:45] i could never be lost no matter how much
[11:47] i do
[11:51] well see that's the point we need to get
[11:53] in our mind to get straight
[11:56] what does it mean to be saved by grace
[11:58] through faith
[12:03] faith is a revelation and through is a
[12:05] journey
[12:08] so then it's not just a lump sum product
[12:14] it's a journey through life
[12:18] and
[12:20] why would we then
[12:22] have any concept or thought of
[12:28] that we could merit anything
[12:34] now
[12:35] we pretty well handle that won't we
[12:41] but then there must be a truth to grace
[12:46] you know there must be a truth
[12:49] because truly we know that it can't be
[12:52] all of the things that are taught
[12:56] and it has to be a
[12:58] an understanding to you and i
[13:02] i'm worried about what anybody else sees
[13:04] and what they do that's up to them
[13:07] it's to you and i personally
[13:10] amen
[13:13] see then grace
[13:17] is
[13:18] unmerited
[13:20] we can use those words right
[13:25] but then what do we use onto those words
[13:31] well i'm saved
[13:33] and it doesn't matter what i do i could
[13:35] never be lost
[13:40] well see if we have that thought in our
[13:42] mind
[13:44] then there must be something wrong with
[13:46] our revelation
[13:53] i got to thank you a lot this week about
[13:57] abraham
[14:00] and i may not even follow my notes
[14:02] whatsoever
[14:05] but you say abraham said
[14:08] he had an unconditional covenant
[14:14] okay i'll go along with you if you
[14:17] understand what you're talking about
[14:23] he said well
[14:25] abraham didn't even repent
[14:29] to get that unconditional covenant
[14:33] you know
[14:36] but what are you calling repentance and
[14:38] what are you calling doing
[14:40] according to my bible it says it
[14:43] abraham believed god
[14:47] and then that believing was imputed unto
[14:50] him
[14:53] for righteousness
[14:56] abraham's justification
[15:00] came on the basis
[15:03] of the fact of what god knew
[15:06] abraham would do
[15:10] now you approach it any other way and
[15:12] how you're going to do it
[15:14] you're going to make a blanket for
[15:16] throwing it out it's just unconditional
[15:22] well then that way god can't condemn
[15:24] anybody to hell
[15:26] if it's like that
[15:28] but i wasn't thinking about abraham
[15:33] that's why i came up with that thought
[15:37] you don't find where abraham got down
[15:39] and repented
[15:44] but he made his sacrifice
[15:48] right
[15:50] and he believed god
[15:55] i'm just laying it down to where we
[15:57] don't have any
[15:58] you know anybody can't come along and
[16:00] say well you just don't know what you're
[16:01] talking about
[16:02] maybe i don't but
[16:04] i truly enjoy thinking
[16:07] the way i do
[16:09] that
[16:12] if it was imputed unto
[16:17] abraham
[16:21] according to the bible it was done
[16:22] because of his believing
[16:27] right
[16:30] he was making the atonement
[16:34] right he was already dealing with the
[16:37] atonement
[16:38] because the time you come to abraham
[16:40] look how long the world had already
[16:42] existed and how much mankind had been
[16:44] making the atonement
[16:50] sure that was even down before moses but
[16:52] yet still they were making the atonement
[16:59] why would you make an atonement
[17:02] if your thoughts were not
[17:04] upon
[17:06] repentance
[17:13] i'm just talking to us tonight okay
[17:21] see we can say well
[17:23] abraham didn't repent
[17:26] he didn't do anything to get it
[17:29] all right that's fine
[17:32] but he'd already been making the
[17:34] atonement
[17:36] he said yeah but he was a heather and
[17:37] you don't know about that no but you
[17:39] don't either so
[17:41] we x out each other
[17:45] mankind had already been making the
[17:47] atonement if you want to go with abraham
[17:51] but my point is
[17:53] when god spoke to abraham
[17:56] abram was his name at that time
[18:01] he believed god
[18:08] now see pro approaching it because
[18:10] that's where we're going to go if we
[18:12] just bypass a lot of this stuff and
[18:14] we'll get right into the scriptures
[18:18] you see there's been an argument of
[18:20] mankind over
[18:21] james saying that abraham was justified
[18:25] by works
[18:29] and then that paul was saying that he
[18:31] was justified by faith
[18:35] well now i've got a couple of quotes in
[18:36] here be glad to read when we get to them
[18:38] or give them to you later
[18:41] but brother brown said they were not
[18:43] contradictory to each other
[18:47] but yet we make it contradictory
[18:54] and see we're going to be one of the two
[18:59] we're going to follow it according to
[19:01] paul
[19:04] are we going to follow it according to
[19:06] james
[19:07] you know to
[19:09] prop up
[19:10] our thoughts
[19:12] to bring a point by our thoughts you
[19:14] know to express
[19:16] what we think to somebody else
[19:21] but when the prophet would say
[19:25] and they're in the same bible
[19:28] and we are supposed to believe the bible
[19:30] that it
[19:31] is not contradictory one to the other
[19:35] but it's the complete revelation of
[19:36] jesus christ
[19:40] then they must be saying
[19:43] the same thing
[19:48] they must be talking about it
[19:51] but yet speaking of it in
[19:53] not two different ways but
[19:56] of things that we look at
[19:59] all right we know the quotes we know the
[20:02] the message
[20:05] and we're quick to say that well
[20:09] paul was speaking of
[20:11] what god saw in abraham
[20:15] and that's true
[20:18] then we turn around and say that james
[20:20] was speaking
[20:22] of what man saw
[20:25] of abraham
[20:26] and it's true
[20:32] so now in that point or that thought
[20:38] why would a christian
[20:42] if we're going to take the one side of
[20:43] faith and the great things or or look at
[20:46] it like that it doesn't matter what i do
[20:49] it's all right i'm saved
[20:57] why would god save it
[21:01] abraham believed him and it was counted
[21:03] unto him for righteousness
[21:10] you know it's odd that as we'll read in
[21:12] a minute that
[21:13] paul in his writing says
[21:20] and concludes his thought the same as
[21:22] james
[21:27] that god counted at righteousness
[21:33] james in his writings
[21:35] says god counted at righteousness
[21:39] but yet seemingly james is talking about
[21:42] his works
[21:53] see then why would a christian
[21:59] why would we need an advocate
[22:09] if we're going to take the stand that it
[22:11] was an unconditional covenant
[22:17] and how that it's
[22:20] no matter what i do
[22:25] i'm saved anyway
[22:30] then
[22:32] what's the purpose of an
[22:34] atonement
[22:40] what's the purpose of an advocate
[22:47] what's the purpose of
[22:49] asking for forgiveness of sin
[22:56] you remember the sister used to be at
[22:57] church with us years ago
[22:59] and i pray that she'll be back before
[23:01] she passes on
[23:04] she said the way y'all preached about
[23:06] god
[23:09] she said then who do i repent too
[23:14] see she caught the thought of us talking
[23:16] about that the bride of christ is god
[23:18] made manifest in flesh
[23:21] but yet she'll know the fact that
[23:23] or didn't hear that we were talking
[23:25] about that we were not the god of glory
[23:28] that begun it all
[23:31] but we were his children we were his
[23:33] offspring
[23:36] can we do that
[23:39] talking about grace
[23:44] that's why i made the point
[23:48] of the new birth that were saved by
[23:50] grace through faith
[23:54] took the same examples
[23:58] of the new birth
[23:59] moved it over into our marital
[24:02] situations of life
[24:06] and showed how god
[24:08] could put those things in his sea
[24:11] of forgetfulness
[24:22] but do we just take it as a
[24:25] well
[24:26] grace
[24:29] what do we think about it
[24:33] see if we do not receive
[24:38] what god has given us
[24:43] then we can't be saved will you agree
[24:45] with that
[24:47] because god won't override your free
[24:49] moral agency
[24:50] but if it's just a blanket of grace
[24:54] unconditional
[25:00] why did he
[25:03] not choose the next door neighbor
[25:06] in the days of abraham that's right
[25:11] why did he not choose somebody else that
[25:13] was a good person down there because
[25:16] abraham come from idolatry
[25:19] or abram did
[25:26] his salvation then just a blanket
[25:28] bestowed out to the world
[25:33] or do we have to accept it right
[25:37] right
[25:39] all right then we found out that
[25:42] by way of the prophet's message
[25:45] that even though we accept him
[25:50] if he does not accept us
[25:54] we don't have the new birth
[25:58] right right
[26:02] all right then
[26:07] i want to ask you a simple question
[26:08] because this is the way i think
[26:14] when the prophet said a pardon is not a
[26:16] pardon
[26:17] unless received is a pardon
[26:20] and it means that we must accept it
[26:23] right
[26:24] all right to be saved to be born again
[26:27] we must accept it
[26:29] to have our marital situations
[26:31] eradicated and put in the sea of
[26:34] forgetfulness
[26:35] we must accept it
[26:41] then he can come back and accept us
[26:46] all right
[26:50] but if we think it's just it doesn't
[26:52] make no difference
[26:55] you know
[26:56] that's once saved always saved that's a
[26:59] good baptist doctrine
[27:05] but at least now
[27:07] they did admit you had to be saved
[27:14] they didn't throw grace out it's just
[27:15] the fact that
[27:17] it was for everybody
[27:19] is for only those that were saved
[27:25] but now if a pardon
[27:26] is not received
[27:29] it's not a
[27:32] pardon are we trying to make grace
[27:36] what kind of a pardon
[27:40] well it don't make no difference
[27:44] i believe brother
[27:46] on the lord jesus christ and he saved me
[27:50] and it now don't make no difference
[27:51] because i'm in an unconditional covenant
[27:58] well now
[28:00] what would have happened
[28:05] or what did happen
[28:10] to the man that you're dealing about a
[28:12] pardon is not a pardon
[28:14] unless received is one
[28:18] they had to make that ruling in the
[28:20] supreme court
[28:23] because
[28:25] the man refused
[28:28] the pardon right
[28:32] that's right
[28:36] he refused to pardon so thereby he was
[28:39] shot by the firing squad
[28:44] see it's not a pardon unless we receive
[28:46] it as one
[28:47] amen
[28:49] grace is not grace
[28:51] unless received
[28:55] no matter what it's for what situation
[28:58] we're talking about
[29:01] you see the way we make grace in our
[29:03] thoughts
[29:05] the man that was in jail sitting there
[29:07] and they offered him the pardon
[29:10] he says i'm saved
[29:14] here's the pardon
[29:17] right
[29:19] he had to pay for work right
[29:21] come on
[29:27] well i know we the man didn't do it
[29:29] because we know why he rejected he
[29:31] thought it was joking with him et cetera
[29:33] et cetera
[29:36] but according to our thoughts of grace
[29:40] the man could have sat there in jail and
[29:42] said
[29:43] i've got to pardon
[29:49] they can't kill me
[29:54] but they did
[29:57] why
[29:59] because he would not
[30:01] accept
[30:02] that pardon
[30:05] for
[30:06] himself
[30:08] and thereby couldn't have been applied
[30:10] unto him
[30:16] see we say it's not what i do or don't
[30:18] do
[30:21] i agree with you
[30:27] but it's whether or not i accept the
[30:28] pardon
[30:30] then
[30:32] because see i know i preach a little
[30:33] different most people
[30:34] do but i believe you're saved by grace
[30:37] through faith
[30:39] that not at work unless any man should
[30:41] boast i agree with that i believe that
[30:45] but i believe once you're born again
[30:50] that born-again experience is totally
[30:52] unconditional
[30:54] except for the point you must accept it
[30:58] and if we don't accept it correctly
[31:01] god doesn't have to accept us right
[31:04] so if i sit in jail
[31:08] as the illustration
[31:10] and i say
[31:13] i'm saved by grace
[31:16] you can't kill me
[31:21] you see
[31:22] then we prove that we don't accept the
[31:23] grace by walking out
[31:26] right
[31:28] because who in his right sense wouldn't
[31:29] get him walk out of jail if they told
[31:31] him he's going to kill him the next
[31:32] morning
[31:35] are you listening
[31:40] see we
[31:41] we want to make grace a
[31:45] the best way i know to say just like
[31:47] it's just a blanket well then nobody's
[31:49] going to hell then
[31:53] but we know that's not true
[32:00] that's why it says you're saved by grace
[32:03] through
[32:04] faith
[32:08] you're not just saying by grace
[32:11] he said grace save me brother amen
[32:16] but you've got to accept the pardon
[32:20] as for you
[32:27] see that way then we can take the
[32:28] scriptures
[32:31] the prophet's message
[32:34] and bring it together to make a
[32:36] beautiful picture
[32:43] that paul is explaining
[32:46] that you're saved by grace
[32:49] but remember it's true faith
[32:53] he's not explaining this to grace is a
[32:56] blanket for anybody just whatever you
[32:58] know
[33:01] he's explaining that you must receive
[33:03] that pardon
[33:07] and if that pardon was not received
[33:09] correctly
[33:11] then it's no good
[33:14] you see i accepted the lord jesus as my
[33:16] savior amen
[33:18] but has he accepted you
[33:23] well i've done all he told me to do well
[33:25] that's good
[33:26] you remember in the book of acts
[33:29] you see why i keep going back to that
[33:31] scripture there in the book of acts the
[33:32] man or the people that they couldn't get
[33:34] the holy ghost to come on
[33:36] they had done everything that was right
[33:38] they were repentant they were baptized
[33:41] and everything was correct
[33:44] but yet something was wrong
[33:52] you see then grace is
[33:55] he said but it's just unmerited favor
[33:58] you don't do anything to get it amen
[34:01] that's right
[34:03] but you must accept it
[34:07] you must believe it
[34:10] you must believe it's for you
[34:12] that's why i said on there when i was
[34:14] preaching about the grace of marriage
[34:15] and divorce
[34:16] if it's not accepted then
[34:18] there you're not free
[34:26] you realize in that then my expression
[34:28] was trying to show that even though your
[34:30] neighbors and everybody in the world
[34:32] knows what you've done yet god don't
[34:34] know what you're doing
[34:37] if you can really believe it
[34:42] but if you keep dilly dallying up and
[34:44] down and
[34:45] having problems
[34:47] of believing
[34:49] then who are you going to blame
[34:56] what are you getting at brother dale
[34:59] grace is not for everybody
[35:04] it's for only those who want it
[35:10] and evidently abraham done a whole lot
[35:12] more than we think
[35:15] because god counted it righteousness
[35:18] the way he believed it
[35:21] but around him used the word justified
[35:23] my and paul uses it about abraham
[35:27] i think james does too but i know for
[35:28] certain paul that said he was justified
[35:32] by faith
[35:40] see then we found justified to be what
[35:45] but the real you never did do it
[35:49] how about it's being so eradicated until
[35:52] you didn't do it
[35:57] brother dale if it's that free i just i
[35:59] just go live like i want to that proves
[36:01] you're not saved
[36:03] right
[36:05] that's not arguing the point of abraham
[36:09] and talking about paul
[36:11] doing that
[36:17] as it said we say well paul
[36:20] abraham didn't repent
[36:23] well
[36:25] maybe he didn't fall down on his knees
[36:26] and
[36:27] beg a lot of forgiveness but
[36:30] he believed god
[36:35] what is forgiveness
[36:39] well i asked the lord to forgive me he
[36:40] forgive me
[36:44] forgiveness is justification
[36:51] no matter what you do if you just ask
[36:53] god to forgive you and really mean it
[36:57] he'll forgive you of that whether ever
[36:58] saves you or not
[37:01] and you won't go to hell for that part
[37:05] why because you repented
[37:09] and god justified you
[37:15] because you wiped your slave clean
[37:18] wouldn't it see if it's forget unless it
[37:20] was totally gone
[37:22] huh
[37:28] but what about it
[37:33] you can't tell me i'm not saved
[37:36] nobody's not trying to tell you you're
[37:38] not saved
[37:40] why are you talking about it
[37:43] you must have been having trouble with
[37:44] it yourself or something because i'm
[37:46] surely not talking about it i'm not
[37:48] trying to do i'm trying to preach so all
[37:50] of us could find out what we are
[37:56] but if the man had to sit in jail
[38:00] and said they cannot and that's what
[38:03] he's doing right
[38:06] he said in there
[38:08] now he didn't say they can't come in
[38:09] here and kill me
[38:10] he just refused to take
[38:13] the pardon
[38:15] if you and i will not accept the pardon
[38:17] and grace of jesus christ there's
[38:19] nothing he can do for us
[38:24] why
[38:26] because it's left it's left into our
[38:28] hands
[38:33] see then sure jonah 2 9 salvation is of
[38:36] the lord
[38:38] we agree with that
[38:43] but after you're saved
[38:46] now what about it
[38:55] i thought we believed the scriptures
[39:00] that we're going to have to give an
[39:01] account
[39:02] of the things we've done
[39:05] but brother dale that's not christians
[39:08] well
[39:10] you go ahead and believe what you want
[39:11] to it's written about christians
[39:16] but brother dale i'll show you where i
[39:18] have no sin
[39:21] good
[39:23] but then what about the scriptures it
[39:25] tells you you're a sinner
[39:28] if you say you have not sinned what does
[39:30] it say about you done
[39:32] you just made god a lie
[39:37] but i thought it was unconditional
[39:41] i changed the title on it brothers back
[39:42] there because you can pull it off i told
[39:45] put on there do not do we sin but
[39:48] we'll just talk about an unconditional
[39:49] covenant brother joe and just write that
[39:51] on it
[39:52] because what does that mean to
[39:54] you an unconditional covenant
[40:02] well that just means there's no
[40:03] condition
[40:11] but you must accept it
[40:16] well you're putting it on condition
[40:18] and we'll see even those who taught
[40:22] like the baptists and things like that
[40:23] you know
[40:25] once saved always saved they did admit
[40:26] you had to be saved
[40:29] so if it's unconditional what you could
[40:31] be saved for
[40:33] are you with me
[40:36] if it's unconditional
[40:39] what do you need saving
[40:43] why do you need an advocate
[40:49] whereas john was saying if we sin talk
[40:52] about christians
[40:54] we have an advocate
[40:58] why do we need one for if it's all grace
[41:09] are you winning are you following me
[41:12] i'm just trying to talk to us simply
[41:14] about
[41:15] salvation and unconditional covenant and
[41:17] thoughts
[41:18] of mankind because you'll see later when
[41:20] we come back to the message
[41:22] of denominationalism you're going to see
[41:25] where all of these will start lining up
[41:29] and to see what we've been taught is
[41:31] what's killing us
[41:37] you come to the baptist you've been
[41:39] taught once safe to always say
[41:42] you come through the pentecostal you
[41:45] you believe you can be saved today and
[41:46] backslide and save today and backslide
[41:48] and speak in tongues and shouting
[41:51] what all what's the rest of them
[41:58] but just think about it
[42:05] what was abraha what was paul and james
[42:08] are doing
[42:10] how can they be reconciled
[42:14] we're only taking the words of a prophet
[42:18] unless the scriptures can come together
[42:20] to show us what was going on
[42:24] right
[42:25] and that's wonderful
[42:27] i'm glad to do that
[42:29] but i love for god to speak to me you
[42:31] know
[42:33] i mean speaking to brother branham was
[42:34] wonderful well he spoke to him to speak
[42:37] to me amen i believe that too
[42:41] but i believe god still speaks
[42:45] what about you
[42:50] then what about an unconditional
[42:56] covenant and we're going to read the
[42:58] scriptures in a minute and you just
[42:59] watch it come down
[43:04] but mainly to think about it that
[43:08] abraham believed
[43:11] abraham got up and went
[43:14] he surely must have been a believer when
[43:15] he took his own boy out to kill him
[43:18] amen
[43:20] he looked like a pretty good believer
[43:21] didn't he
[43:23] look like abraham had a lot of works
[43:25] that james could talk about doesn't it
[43:31] if they're not contrary or contradictory
[43:34] to each other
[43:36] they had to be saying the same thing
[43:40] right
[43:43] you know the reason i believe that that
[43:45] it's written like that
[43:48] i believe it's written
[43:50] to keep us lined up
[43:54] because if you're only reading paul
[43:57] without our understanding
[44:00] it looks like it doesn't make no
[44:01] difference what we do
[44:03] we're saved anyway
[44:06] oh once they always say we're on our way
[44:08] to heaven
[44:09] grace
[44:11] the prophet says we make it disgrace
[44:13] right
[44:16] and we're not talking about all the
[44:18] garbage of the world of
[44:19] denominationalisms and places of free
[44:21] loves and stuff like that that they can
[44:23] claim they're saved by grace that don't
[44:25] make no difference and you think people
[44:27] don't believe it that away
[44:32] you get out there and talk a little bit
[44:34] you'll find out
[44:38] they believe because they belong to that
[44:40] church and that doctrine that they're
[44:42] saved
[44:46] how much is that still left in you and
[44:48] me
[44:51] are we like the brother not throwing off
[44:53] on him he's dead and going on but we
[44:55] have pounded his arms and say instead of
[44:57] hearing those caves and fast
[45:00] and pray for days and days and weeks but
[45:04] he said they ain't an ounce of tradition
[45:05] in this old body
[45:08] but when they spoke to him about water
[45:10] baptism in the name of the lord jesus
[45:12] christ he denied it
[45:19] we're not talking about people going out
[45:21] and just living garbage cans and saying
[45:23] it's all right
[45:27] we're talking about people that
[45:29] are trying to do right
[45:35] well what about it
[45:40] so when paul
[45:43] was looking at abraham
[45:46] was he totally justifying him just by
[45:48] what he believed
[45:56] or was paul knowing that abraham's
[45:59] believing
[46:03] was a type
[46:06] of the born-again believer
[46:09] that believed
[46:14] then is it okay do you just believe
[46:15] anything
[46:20] see then when james comes along and says
[46:22] show me your faith without your words
[46:23] i'll show you my faith by my words
[46:26] was he believing in works
[46:30] your armenians
[46:32] take that side
[46:35] right
[46:36] your calvinists take the side of
[46:40] well it's just faith
[46:43] no matter what you do it's just faith
[46:46] and your armenians come along and say
[46:48] well now wait a minute
[46:49] there's got to be works
[46:55] well what about both of them having the
[46:56] truth
[46:59] but you got to bring them together in
[47:00] the middle of the road to have the truth
[47:05] what about that
[47:11] you see there's not a church in the
[47:13] world a prophet said it didn't start out
[47:15] right
[47:16] right
[47:18] that's the way he says
[47:21] they started out right
[47:24] what about you and i
[47:30] which one is it
[47:40] we realize that the kingdom of god is
[47:42] not what we eat or drink or wearing of a
[47:44] pearl
[47:45] quoting from the mark of the beast
[47:47] we realize that god we realize that
[47:52] god that we don't stop this and stop
[47:55] wearing this
[47:56] and this to make us different
[47:59] but when the spirit of christ comes in
[48:02] it does that itself
[48:06] it's not what we do
[48:10] but what he does
[48:14] now this is the man that's explaining
[48:20] that paul
[48:22] and james is saying the same thing
[48:26] look at the images of christ where he
[48:28] says
[48:32] we don't believe that packing an image
[48:35] makes you a christian
[48:41] but yet he had one in his car over the
[48:45] river mirror
[48:48] he had a cross right
[48:51] did he say that
[48:56] he said something goes wrong you just
[48:57] look at that cross
[49:02] but he says that don't make you a
[49:04] christian
[49:06] i believe that being an image of christ
[49:10] makes us a christian
[49:14] it's not what we do outwardly
[49:18] it's what happened inwardly
[49:20] that makes us what we are
[49:22] then therefore if he is our image
[49:25] and we are his likeness
[49:28] and members of his body
[49:30] we should be the image like him
[49:34] then our lives should reflect the image
[49:36] of christ
[49:38] not in our joining a church
[49:40] or in packing crucifix or emotions we
[49:44] should be in the living presence
[49:46] a living god that's reflecting
[49:48] throughout our life
[49:54] not what we do or don't do
[49:58] right
[50:05] it's whether or not we believe
[50:10] that he died for us
[50:18] you see believing that god came and
[50:19] lived is one thing
[50:24] believing that mom and dad is saved and
[50:25] all he does that's another thing
[50:28] but that's still part of it
[50:31] but that don't save you
[50:35] it's whether or not you can believe
[50:42] whether or not you can believe that god
[50:44] died in your place
[50:51] unconditional covenant
[50:54] and he made another covenant he talks
[50:56] about one with abraham that's on god's
[50:57] provided place of worship
[50:59] number six if you're gonna pull it up
[51:00] there
[51:01] but he made another covenant and that
[51:03] was with abraham
[51:05] the covenant was
[51:06] not on condition but was unconditionally
[51:10] god gave the covenant to abraham
[51:12] no strains tied to it at all
[51:16] unconditional
[51:17] not i will i've already done it
[51:21] that's the law that christians must live
[51:24] by
[51:26] it's not what we do
[51:29] not what we do ourselves
[51:32] but what he's done for us
[51:35] christ has already been sacrificed
[51:37] not he will he has been it's a finished
[51:40] product he lived died rose again
[51:43] ascended to heaven has come back in the
[51:44] form of the holy ghost
[51:47] and it's a finished work with god
[51:50] christ knowing no sin became my sin thou
[51:53] might stand in his place
[51:55] he took my place
[51:57] i was in him at calvary when he died
[52:00] you know i must die
[52:02] there
[52:03] i must die with him to live
[52:06] because the law of sin and death is in
[52:08] this body
[52:10] you have to die
[52:12] to be reconciled to him
[52:15] the law of sin and death
[52:17] is in this body
[52:24] but this body brother dale is no he's
[52:26] useless i mean that's where we can
[52:28] quickly
[52:30] see we're good quoters
[52:32] all right let me say it again
[52:34] we're good coders
[52:38] there's a difference in the coder and
[52:39] the quota and i can pull a quote up to
[52:41] show you that all right
[52:44] he said they didn't code it they quote
[52:46] they didn't quote it they coded it
[52:50] that's what the devil said to jesus and
[52:52] i'll give it to you
[52:55] well he quoted him no he coded the word
[52:58] a lot of difference in it too
[53:01] but you see
[53:06] do we believe we can just
[53:09] we don't have to worry about nothing
[53:10] we're saved
[53:15] do we believe that
[53:17] romans 14 and 10 says
[53:20] for it is written as i live saith the
[53:22] lord every knee shall bow to me and
[53:24] every tongue shall confess to god
[53:29] do we believe that
[53:33] 11th verse so then every one of us shall
[53:35] give an account of himself to god
[53:40] now we're under unconditional covenant
[53:41] what are we going to give an account for
[53:46] so you just annihilated that scripture
[53:49] by your thought
[53:56] you see that's what we've done that's
[53:57] what i want to get to an organized
[53:59] religion
[54:00] denominationalism
[54:05] brother random even said moses when he
[54:07] smoked that rock
[54:10] the second time he said he set up a
[54:11] denomination
[54:20] you see
[54:27] romans 8 and 13 for if we live after the
[54:29] flesh
[54:31] or if you live after the flesh you shall
[54:33] die
[54:34] but if ye through the spirit do mortify
[54:36] the deeds of the body you shall live
[54:40] right
[54:43] romans two and six
[54:45] it will render to every man according to
[54:47] his
[54:50] deeds romans 3 and 20
[54:54] therefore by the deeds of the law shall
[54:56] no flesh be justified
[54:58] in his sight for by the law is the
[55:01] knowledge of sin
[55:10] but now the righteousness of god this is
[55:12] what we like
[55:14] without the law it's manifested being
[55:16] witnessed by the law and the prophets
[55:18] amen agree with every bit of it
[55:22] but once even the righteousness of god
[55:24] which is by faith of jesus christ unto
[55:28] all and upon all them that believe for
[55:29] there is no difference
[55:31] for all have sinned and come short of
[55:33] the glory of the god
[55:37] being justified freely by his grace
[55:39] through the redemption that is in jesus
[55:41] christ
[55:45] whom god has set forth to be a
[55:47] perpetuation
[55:48] through faith in his blood
[55:51] to declare his righteousness for the
[55:52] remission of sins that are priced
[55:55] through the forbearance of god
[56:01] to declare i say at this time his
[56:03] righteousness
[56:06] that he might be just
[56:08] and the justifier of them which believe
[56:10] in jesus
[56:12] where is boasting then
[56:16] it is excluded
[56:19] by what law
[56:21] of works
[56:23] nay
[56:25] but by the law of faith
[56:28] therefore we conclude that a man is
[56:29] justified by faith
[56:32] without the deeds of the law
[56:36] that's paul right
[56:40] is he the god of the jews only or is it
[56:41] not the god of gentiles also yes of the
[56:43] gentiles also
[56:45] see it as one god which shall justify
[56:48] the
[56:49] circumcision by faith
[56:52] and uncircumcision through faith now i
[56:54] wonder why that would happen that way
[56:58] one of the jews get it
[57:00] that they're justified
[57:01] by faith but to us gentiles
[57:04] have to go through faith
[57:09] right
[57:10] now is god different to the jew and the
[57:12] gentile he just said no he wouldn't
[57:14] what's he saying
[57:15] he's saying that gentiles is the one
[57:17] that's going to mess it all up
[57:22] and done a good job down through seven
[57:23] church ages
[57:28] do we then make void the law through
[57:30] faith
[57:34] god forbid yea we establish the law
[57:44] what shall we say then that abraham our
[57:45] father as pertaining to the flesh hath
[57:48] found
[57:50] for if abraham were justified by works
[57:53] he hath were of the glory
[57:55] but not before god that's exactly right
[58:02] that's exactly right because that's what
[58:04] james is saying
[58:08] james is saying the same thing
[58:11] once
[58:13] for what saith the scripture abraham
[58:15] believed god and it was counted unto him
[58:19] for righteousness
[58:22] we look down through there and we think
[58:24] well paul is taking it one way therefore
[58:26] we've concluded a man is justified by
[58:28] faith without the deeds of the law amen
[58:35] see can you say amen really mean it
[58:41] that there's nothing we can do
[58:44] it's what he's done
[58:47] and even after being born again
[58:51] it's still not what we do
[58:54] it's what he's come inside to live
[58:56] amen can we believe it that way
[58:59] therefore we conclude that a man is
[59:01] justified by faith without the deeds of
[59:04] the law well it don't matter then what i
[59:06] do that's not what he said
[59:12] he goes on later and he said shall we
[59:15] sin that grace may about
[59:20] he said god forbid
[59:25] if i do that i make myself subject to
[59:27] that i become that part
[59:33] look what james says
[59:38] yeah amen they say
[59:40] thou has faith
[59:43] and i have works
[59:45] show me thy faith
[59:47] without thy works
[59:49] and i'll show thee my faith by my works
[59:53] can you say amen to that
[1:00:00] look on where he put in there in the
[1:00:02] middle of that
[1:00:03] i
[1:00:05] i
[1:00:05] you know
[1:00:07] i've never tried to make myself in a
[1:00:08] place with none of these fellers in the
[1:00:10] writing
[1:00:11] but it
[1:00:12] it really gets to you sometimes what
[1:00:13] goes in the middle every once in a while
[1:00:19] now i believe it's that there's one god
[1:00:24] that'll do us well
[1:00:26] the devils also believing trump
[1:00:29] and he goes back to his thought
[1:00:32] but you know that's his thought there
[1:00:36] i mean we say we believe we believe god
[1:00:40] so does the devil
[1:00:48] but we'll i know oh man
[1:00:51] that faith without works is dead
[1:00:58] was not abraham our father justified by
[1:01:01] works
[1:01:05] come on
[1:01:07] now if that's not contradictory to what
[1:01:09] i just read over here
[1:01:11] that paul said it was
[1:01:13] justified without the deeds of the law
[1:01:25] and here james says
[1:01:26] was not our father abraham justified by
[1:01:29] works
[1:01:31] when it offered isaac his son upon the
[1:01:33] altar
[1:01:35] seeth how faith wrought with his works
[1:01:40] now watch him
[1:01:42] faith
[1:01:43] came together
[1:01:49] and his works
[1:01:50] displayed
[1:01:53] the faith that he had
[1:01:56] is that what he's saying
[1:02:00] and by works was faith made
[1:02:02] complete
[1:02:04] perfect perfectly complete
[1:02:07] finished
[1:02:11] and the scripture was fulfilled
[1:02:16] now what was a paul said over here
[1:02:21] for what saith the scripture
[1:02:29] you remember a few weeks ago when i was
[1:02:30] trying to preach how did it
[1:02:33] it must be the same way all the way
[1:02:34] through the bible and everything must be
[1:02:36] the same or we're missing it
[1:02:39] so now paul
[1:02:43] you just said for what saith the
[1:02:45] scripture
[1:02:50] abraham believed god and it was counted
[1:02:52] unto him for righteousness
[1:02:56] james says and the scripture was full
[1:02:59] filled
[1:03:03] didn't we read over there what paul was
[1:03:05] saying that we
[1:03:07] we established
[1:03:09] these things
[1:03:12] we put it in effect and make it work
[1:03:14] so look at james
[1:03:18] and the scripture was fulfilled
[1:03:22] how
[1:03:25] because abraham
[1:03:27] went out and done what god said do
[1:03:32] right
[1:03:35] then everybody around him says
[1:03:38] well
[1:03:41] especially the three guys or two or
[1:03:42] three that went with him for a little
[1:03:43] piece you know
[1:03:44] they left him there
[1:03:48] and abraham comes back and
[1:03:52] he finally tells sarah what he went up
[1:03:54] there to do
[1:03:56] i don't believe he told her for them
[1:03:59] and he said i took isaac up there
[1:04:03] he said i was going to kill him
[1:04:05] because god told me to
[1:04:08] and god inspired me to
[1:04:10] here's isaac
[1:04:12] isaac said
[1:04:15] i was kind of worried for a little while
[1:04:17] yeah
[1:04:18] because he asked daddy about it said i
[1:04:21] said daddy
[1:04:23] said we got the wood
[1:04:25] we got the fire
[1:04:27] we got the knife
[1:04:30] but where's the sacrifice
[1:04:34] now
[1:04:37] oh zach back there he's
[1:04:39] dale yeah
[1:04:43] he's pretty good sizable little fella
[1:04:47] i kind of believe it'd be hard for me to
[1:04:48] get him up on the altar
[1:04:51] if he knew i was going to kill him
[1:04:54] now little zach black
[1:04:59] he's got a black belt in karate
[1:05:03] he may be little
[1:05:06] but i don't believe bob could get him on
[1:05:07] that altar
[1:05:09] right
[1:05:10] i'm just being honest right
[1:05:14] but you know about the time they got up
[1:05:16] there
[1:05:18] somewhere in that point
[1:05:20] isaac begin to think i guess
[1:05:26] he said
[1:05:28] i think i found out who they're going to
[1:05:29] be to sacrifice
[1:05:33] and he never fought his father
[1:05:36] he just laid down
[1:05:45] well we surely ought to talk about
[1:05:46] isaac's faith in it for a little while
[1:05:52] because isaac's faith was beginning to
[1:05:54] believe what was going to take place
[1:05:56] that was his revelation that was his
[1:05:58] faith paul was speaking of
[1:06:02] but he just laid down
[1:06:04] that's what james was talking about
[1:06:07] because faith without works is dead
[1:06:11] you tell me you're a christian i expect
[1:06:14] to see you act like one
[1:06:18] right
[1:06:21] but then the odd the way paul paul says
[1:06:24] it and then peter james
[1:06:26] and the scripture was fulfilled
[1:06:30] which saith that's what abraham was
[1:06:33] that's what paul was saying the
[1:06:34] scripture said it
[1:06:36] james said it was fulfilled
[1:06:39] so they were talking about the same
[1:06:41] thing
[1:06:42] and abraham believed god and it was
[1:06:44] imputed unto him for righteousness
[1:06:46] and look
[1:06:47] paul never said this about him
[1:06:52] james said after all the conclusion
[1:06:57] of seeing all the life of abraham
[1:07:00] and his calling
[1:07:03] and his unconditional covenant and his
[1:07:05] believing and serving god
[1:07:08] and doing what god told him to do
[1:07:13] he said my conclusion is
[1:07:16] he's a friend of god
[1:07:20] wouldn't it be nice if somebody said
[1:07:22] that about you and me
[1:07:28] that we're a friend of god
[1:07:32] james was putting that i believe on the
[1:07:34] fact that
[1:07:36] abraham believed
[1:07:38] but yet he done something about his
[1:07:40] believing
[1:07:42] what are you not going to do
[1:07:47] what is an unconditional covenant well
[1:07:49] it just don't make no difference
[1:07:52] well you're not even in the covenant
[1:07:56] because you got to take james and put it
[1:07:58] there to see
[1:08:02] i know i got into trouble during romans
[1:08:05] 8 1.
[1:08:08] and i used that word i'll have to think
[1:08:10] of it for
[1:08:12] interpolated
[1:08:14] i got into trouble a lot of ministers
[1:08:15] about using the word interpolated it's
[1:08:18] uh
[1:08:20] schofield uses it
[1:08:23] in romans 8 where it says there is
[1:08:24] therefore now no condemnation of them
[1:08:26] that are in christ jesus
[1:08:28] now if he just stop right there look
[1:08:30] what a situation he'd leave
[1:08:34] and show you that paul wasn't just all
[1:08:36] faith
[1:08:38] see
[1:08:40] he said there is therefore now no
[1:08:41] condemnation of them that are in christ
[1:08:43] jesus
[1:08:47] and he realized
[1:08:49] that he was leaving a loophole
[1:08:52] that mankind would use
[1:08:57] so it says to those that walk not after
[1:08:59] the flesh you know
[1:09:01] but after the spirit
[1:09:02] that's called interpolating
[1:09:06] giving your thought and then making sure
[1:09:08] that your thought
[1:09:09] is not misunderstood
[1:09:13] you illustrate it you explain it you
[1:09:16] you talk about it
[1:09:21] and you're putting your thought down
[1:09:22] into words
[1:09:26] right now
[1:09:28] paul looks at abraham
[1:09:31] as his faith
[1:09:34] james looks at him as his works
[1:09:39] and both of them's got to be saying the
[1:09:41] same thing
[1:09:44] no
[1:09:45] faith paul said without works is dead or
[1:09:48] jane wanted to
[1:09:53] we claim to be christians
[1:09:58] the world has a right to look at us and
[1:10:00] to see whether we are or not
[1:10:02] how we dress how we act how we do
[1:10:12] but yet
[1:10:15] it don't matter what i do or don't do
[1:10:18] i'm saved by faith
[1:10:21] no you're saved by grace
[1:10:24] through faith amen
[1:10:27] that's what james and paul was talking
[1:10:29] about
[1:10:34] he said what's your point okay
[1:10:37] it's like i said two or three times and
[1:10:39] i said it back a long time ago
[1:10:44] i believe a lot of people in this
[1:10:45] message will have to die and go by the
[1:10:47] grave
[1:10:50] i may be one of them
[1:10:53] no problem i'm not de-christianizing
[1:10:55] anybody never i have
[1:10:59] never thrown off on any of you
[1:11:01] with a marital situation whatsoever
[1:11:10] i believe a lot of people are going to
[1:11:11] go by the grave because they can't
[1:11:13] believe god
[1:11:16] they can't believe god has forgiven them
[1:11:21] oh yeah they can believe the forgiving
[1:11:23] part
[1:11:26] but they can't bring that part into
[1:11:28] justification
[1:11:31] i i believe i'm forgiven
[1:11:33] but i still have problems
[1:11:40] is that the way a lot of people do about
[1:11:41] the new birth
[1:11:42] well i believe i'm born again but i just
[1:11:44] don't know
[1:11:47] don't know where i'm gonna make it to
[1:11:48] heaven or not i hope i do
[1:11:51] and saying you're born again
[1:11:59] but you see church
[1:12:05] salvation is not based upon
[1:12:08] what you do or don't do
[1:12:15] it's based upon whether or not
[1:12:17] i can believe
[1:12:19] that god took my place
[1:12:24] now how many times have you ever heard
[1:12:26] me try to explain
[1:12:27] about a heather and with a totem pole
[1:12:33] that heather and believes that his
[1:12:34] imaginary god enters that totem pole
[1:12:40] and he's got somebody to explain to him
[1:12:42] about the heathen
[1:12:45] heather and idea you know good preachers
[1:12:50] but they believe
[1:12:52] that whatever that imaginary god speaks
[1:12:54] to them they go and do
[1:12:58] they'll feed their babies to an
[1:12:59] alligator or whatever you know
[1:13:05] why
[1:13:06] because they believe their god is
[1:13:07] telling them
[1:13:12] you know i thank god that brother random
[1:13:14] made this statement
[1:13:17] he said god may not out may not ask for
[1:13:20] you to offer your child
[1:13:23] as he spoke to abraham
[1:13:29] i'm glad of that aren't you
[1:13:33] but he may have other things to ask us
[1:13:39] he simply asked us to live
[1:13:43] before the world
[1:13:49] to let the world see jesus christ
[1:13:58] you know what we're doing is arguing
[1:13:59] over grace or faith or works or law
[1:14:10] fussing about it
[1:14:14] instead of believing it accepting it
[1:14:20] if you don't believe god will forgive
[1:14:22] your sin why do you pray
[1:14:25] come on
[1:14:26] what's the purpose of praying if you
[1:14:27] don't believe god's not going to hear
[1:14:28] you
[1:14:35] it's all based on whether or not we
[1:14:37] believe it in it
[1:14:41] now
[1:14:42] brother dale after all the conclusion of
[1:14:45] what you've brought tonight bringing it
[1:14:47] together what you've come down to
[1:14:49] seemingly
[1:14:51] bring is a
[1:14:53] conclusion of the matter
[1:15:01] you seem to believe that we've got to do
[1:15:03] something
[1:15:06] to be saved
[1:15:09] i do
[1:15:12] i believe we've got to accept it
[1:15:17] all right
[1:15:18] so i believe we got something to do
[1:15:20] we got to accept it
[1:15:23] that doesn't change where it's
[1:15:24] unconditional
[1:15:26] yeah but if it's unconditional
[1:15:29] then it don't matter whether i ask for
[1:15:31] it
[1:15:32] accept it or whatever he's going to give
[1:15:34] it to me
[1:15:35] now
[1:15:36] you show me i've been one hour and some
[1:15:39] one hour a little over
[1:15:42] showing you that james and paul
[1:15:44] is not contrary
[1:15:47] showing you
[1:15:50] that abraham
[1:15:53] believed god
[1:15:59] he had something to do in it because god
[1:16:01] knew he'd believe him
[1:16:04] did he give him an unconditional
[1:16:05] covenant
[1:16:06] just
[1:16:11] is he going to save every jew
[1:16:17] come
[1:16:18] on
[1:16:20] he told paul i told
[1:16:23] abram
[1:16:24] you and your seat after you
[1:16:30] is he going to save everybody no
[1:16:36] he's going to save those who believe
[1:16:41] that's simple
[1:16:43] well like i do believe
[1:16:46] that's all you can do
[1:16:51] but then god sees our believing
[1:16:55] and comes on the scene
[1:16:59] and accepts our believing
[1:17:02] there's your salvation amen
[1:17:08] you want to call that works i don't call
[1:17:10] it works i just call it being
[1:17:13] plain and just honest
[1:17:19] god starts dealing in your heart
[1:17:20] children
[1:17:22] you say lord
[1:17:26] help me
[1:17:30] help me
[1:17:33] speak to me
[1:17:36] i'm sorry
[1:17:38] because that's the first thing in the
[1:17:39] presence of god so you tell me abraham
[1:17:42] didn't repent
[1:17:50] i'm honest
[1:17:53] maybe not in the way we call lord
[1:17:55] forgive me god forget
[1:17:56] no
[1:18:00] but he certainly wanted to walk right
[1:18:01] from then on
[1:18:04] and he kept on making the sacrifice
[1:18:07] and you make a sacrifice
[1:18:10] because you realize there's something
[1:18:12] wrong
[1:18:14] right
[1:18:17] quick as the kids in the garden found
[1:18:18] out they were wrong what did they do you
[1:18:21] know when donald mccain and they will
[1:18:22] vote what to do they made it
[1:18:24] offering your offering means repentance
[1:18:29] you take the animal up i'm repenting
[1:18:31] lord
[1:18:32] pack the animal in my place
[1:18:36] i just got to thinking about that i
[1:18:38] thought people will say but abraham
[1:18:40] didn't repent
[1:18:44] he sure done a lot of things
[1:18:49] he done so much until james
[1:18:52] would speak
[1:18:55] of the works
[1:18:56] that he done
[1:19:00] and how did he prove what he was by what
[1:19:02] he done
[1:19:04] do you see what james is doing james is
[1:19:06] not contrary to paul
[1:19:09] you know if paul has been sitting there
[1:19:12] my cousin
[1:19:13] he's against me
[1:19:17] he knows what i've been told
[1:19:20] it was all faith
[1:19:22] he said he's he's speaking against me
[1:19:26] if paul has been sitting there listening
[1:19:27] to james he's been screaming holiday man
[1:19:31] right
[1:19:32] jane said listening to paul would have
[1:19:34] been screaming and hollering amen
[1:19:36] that's why i got two in here if you need
[1:19:38] them but brother runner said it was not
[1:19:40] contradictory
[1:19:43] he said they were both saying the same
[1:19:45] thing
[1:19:47] one was expressing what god was seeing
[1:19:51] the other one was expressing what
[1:19:53] mankind sees
[1:19:55] all right then
[1:19:58] if you put them both together
[1:20:01] you go out and talk about your faith
[1:20:06] your stumbling block
[1:20:09] to go out and live like the devil and
[1:20:10] talk about your faith
[1:20:12] that ain't nothing but a stumbling block
[1:20:14] of the devil i don't care how much faith
[1:20:16] you got i don't care how much great
[1:20:19] revelation you've got
[1:20:22] people are watching your life
[1:20:25] to see whether or not you believe what
[1:20:26] you're talking about
[1:20:32] see
[1:20:34] what is an unconditional covenant then
[1:20:36] brother dale
[1:20:38] almighty god
[1:20:41] came down
[1:20:42] and paid the price for me
[1:20:49] made it to work
[1:20:52] he could cleanse me out
[1:20:55] and come and live inside of me
[1:20:58] to make sure
[1:21:00] that the works would be of him
[1:21:03] that's right
[1:21:04] the works of mankind is worth nothing
[1:21:07] they're filthy rights the bible says
[1:21:10] when god comes down into you
[1:21:14] and then you just walk out through there
[1:21:16] just being what you are
[1:21:21] just be what you are wherever you're at
[1:21:26] sure we're all human
[1:21:27] we make mistakes we do wrong
[1:21:31] that's why we have to have an advocate
[1:21:36] right
[1:21:38] why do you need an advocate if you don't
[1:21:40] do wrong
[1:21:45] and then the bible said for the sins
[1:21:47] the prophet said to christian sins he
[1:21:49] said yes
[1:21:50] said brother brown are you saying he
[1:21:51] said every day
[1:21:56] but then he'll turn around and tell you
[1:21:58] over and over
[1:21:59] that a christian cannot sin
[1:22:08] but you know what he's exactly right
[1:22:13] a real true christian inwardly cannot
[1:22:15] sin
[1:22:16] but we can sin outwardly
[1:22:20] see that's why church i don't believe
[1:22:21] the new birth
[1:22:23] does away with our marital problems
[1:22:27] i've never believed that
[1:22:32] because you got trouble dealing with
[1:22:34] paul i mean with with luther and all of
[1:22:36] those you're going to have to totally
[1:22:38] drive them to hell
[1:22:45] because we have to admit we have done a
[1:22:46] lot wrong
[1:22:52] but if we can see
[1:22:55] that he
[1:22:57] paid the price
[1:23:01] then we can walk out free
[1:23:04] we can step outside the belt draw the
[1:23:07] bars of those jails
[1:23:09] and come out of there free
[1:23:13] and god says come my son
[1:23:20] i hope you understand
[1:23:22] i guess
[1:23:27] the devil fought me more today than any
[1:23:29] time
[1:23:31] because i just wanted to talk to you
[1:23:37] to make sure you and i understand
[1:23:42] we're saved by grace through faith
[1:23:46] and if we don't live that christian life
[1:23:51] from the inward man
[1:23:53] then we're nothing but a stumbling block
[1:23:57] in front of our neighbors and the people
[1:23:59] around us
[1:24:03] sure we're human sure we do wrong sure
[1:24:06] we
[1:24:08] have a little temperance because if you
[1:24:10] don't need no temperance i mean if you
[1:24:12] don't have a temper what do you need
[1:24:13] temperance in the statue of perfect land
[1:24:15] for
[1:24:17] and if you've got all knowledge why do
[1:24:19] you need knowledge
[1:24:25] you see
[1:24:30] the scriptures tells us where we stand
[1:24:34] he that the son is set free is free
[1:24:36] indeed but we got to believe that
[1:24:41] and say thank you lord that's mine
[1:24:44] come on brothers
[1:24:46] see that's mine
[1:24:49] james and paul is saying the same thing
[1:24:53] and what they're saying is what the
[1:24:54] whole entire bible is said
[1:25:00] we must accept jesus christ as our
[1:25:02] savior
[1:25:03] but then we want him to come in and live
[1:25:07] paul said it's not i that liveth but
[1:25:09] christ that liveth in me
[1:25:16] but i thought it was grace
[1:25:18] i thought it was an unconditional
[1:25:24] let me explain that just a second
[1:25:29] the prophet said
[1:25:31] when i get ready to go overseas
[1:25:35] you remember that
[1:25:39] he said
[1:25:40] i don't grab my wife so now you you
[1:25:43] you you run around with me while i'm
[1:25:44] gone you're divorced you know here
[1:25:47] she don't grab me and say you better not
[1:25:49] be fooling around
[1:25:53] he said we get down and pray
[1:25:56] and i commit them to the lord and they
[1:25:58] commit me to the lord
[1:26:00] and he said even though
[1:26:04] i believe
[1:26:06] that if i went out and done something
[1:26:07] wrong
[1:26:09] and came home
[1:26:11] and told my wife
[1:26:15] he said i believe she'd forgive me
[1:26:21] he said but how dare me to think about
[1:26:23] even that
[1:26:29] how could he even think about it
[1:26:33] her at home standing before the public
[1:26:35] and putting up all the things she had to
[1:26:37] do you know
[1:26:39] he said here i am he said i'm gone
[1:26:41] out preaching
[1:26:42] sometimes three or four months he'd be
[1:26:44] gone he said come in home next morning
[1:26:47] at five o'clock i got my hat and got in
[1:26:48] my hunting clothes and gone to the woods
[1:26:51] he said how many women to put up with
[1:26:53] that
[1:26:59] then how could we sin when we know
[1:27:03] see this is the way i think
[1:27:07] how could i go out and sin
[1:27:10] willfully doing it
[1:27:14] when i know
[1:27:15] that he's not going to send me to hell
[1:27:21] see that's not works that's not legalism
[1:27:25] that's a bond of love
[1:27:28] it's in my heart for my master
[1:27:34] then brother dale do you do wrong yes
[1:27:36] every day
[1:27:38] do you have to repent every night that's
[1:27:40] my last thing lord
[1:27:42] forgive my sins
[1:27:47] and sometimes you know you can't
[1:27:48] remember maybe what you've done but just
[1:27:50] remember when you ask god says sins
[1:27:53] he knows what them sins were
[1:28:05] see then what is it church
[1:28:09] it's amazing grace
[1:28:10] well we got ready 369
[1:28:15] let's stand
[1:28:19] the mighty god is jesus the prince of
[1:28:23] peace is
[1:28:24] the everlasting father
[1:28:33] you know him like that as a savior
[1:28:39] to live inside of you
[1:28:46] if not come and let's
[1:28:48] talk to him
[1:28:52] let's talk to him about it
[1:28:57] the mighty god is jesus
[1:29:03] see with a dog like that who wouldn't
[1:29:05] want to serve me
[1:29:12] they won't destroy us because we do
[1:29:14] wrong
[1:29:18] but we're just destroyed because we
[1:29:20] don't do anything about it
[1:29:29] all the little examples because i'm just
[1:29:31] thinking today just
[1:29:32] the lord
[1:29:39] don't let us get caught with these
[1:29:40] things
[1:29:46] come on to sing lord
