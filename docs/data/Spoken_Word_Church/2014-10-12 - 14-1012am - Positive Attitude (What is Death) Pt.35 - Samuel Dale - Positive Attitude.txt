15 and we'll try to continue our thought that we've been talking on of death being destroyed and the things and I pray that the Lord will bless each and every one of us uh many sicknesses Among Us so remember each one uh Danny says Joyce is sick this morning so remember her and just that the Lord would reach down and touch her because we know that that's the day and the hour and Satan is fighting on every hand but we're more than Overcomers through Jesus Christ all right remember now the Fall Festival coming up on the 25th and remember brother forny will be with us on the 26th Sunday they're preaching for us brother bras will be with us on Wednesday the 29th brother Ernie Villa NOA will be with us on November the 2nd and then brother William uh uh B leavon will be with us preaching the watch not service so we got those remember each one of those remember brother U uh Brother Richard Douglas he's been having a lot of trouble with that problem over what happened there and and all the sicknesses and so remember that and just pray that the Lord would would bring him on out of it cuz I know it leaves you weak and in a lot of troubles and things and all so remember each one of those amen uh First Corinthians all right Heavenly Father we thank you for the day the hour the grace the love the understanding that you've given us we thank you for you and we pray that you would just bless each one now remember the sick among us you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we thank you and we just ask you to help us and guide us now forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us in your love Lord that we may see you and Lord just teach us to wait because we know in Waiting that it brings us patience it brings us understanding of what the hour and the day that we're living just have your way now and guide each one in Jesus name amen 1 Corinthians 15 we'll start reading in verse 51 behold I I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep we shall but we shall all be chained in a moment in a twinkling of an eye the last trunk for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption now watch when this and this Mortal when this Mortal shall have put on immortality then at that time not before after whatever right there shall be brought to P the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giv us us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word amen now we have been talking about you know The Last Enemy that we see is to be destroyed is death right two babies oh okay a yeah oh yeah that is right hey we got a new visitor stand up and let us see the little visitor Sophia Rose Sophia Rose amen we're always glad to have our visitors with us you know even no matter how little they are they're still one of us and then they become a part of us all right amen just remember that uh remember Josiah you know he went out to I hope he's out there showing those brother how a elk hunt in Colorado so maybe we'll get a good report when he gets back amen but we've been talking about the life enemy to be destroyed is death now we tried to cover this last service on one thing for certainty the prophet says death is my victory amen now you never heard a man talk like that you know until the end time because he knew what it was but he said death can only pull me into the presence of God right well we shouldn't fear death amen because fear had torment see and that's the problem we get afraid and we do and and even scientifically speaking they'll tell you the doctors and the things will tell you that you know if you fear something then that will that will conquer you you're already conquered when you have that fear all right but see that Last Enemy to be destroyed is death all right then we know for a certainty that the Lord Jesus Christ conquered death hell the grave all things all right and then and when he did that he brought life and immortality to light through the gospel to word that we could understand all right but we know also that we're still dying so then there's something wrong somewhere right all right so the point is what by the new birth we are in the kingdom of God our soul is eternal all right it's already redeemed all right and we're page 45 or 49 if future WR waiting the the Redemption of the body all right now that was paid for at Calvary you remember we're not talking about something that's not done or a finished product we're talking about a finished product that's done but yet not totally been applied unto mankind I try to illustrate it always where you can think about it the salvation of Israel that will be on after we leave out of here the 100 144,000 but yet that salvation is already finished at Calvary but it wasn't applied all right now so then the body was redeemed Jesus Christ doesn't have to come back and die again the body is redeemed but it was not applied all right it's it's not been applied to mankind down through time of that L Redemption all right and you know I know for I know you think me wrong a lot of times to say things over and over but uh see you and I have got to come to a place that we can look death in the face and not let it be our conqueror let it be the point that if we die so what that's right that only takes me into the presence of the Lord is that what Paul was explaining you know he said for me now it's good for me to go on he said but for you it's needful that I stay here all right see then that you know we should get to the point you say but but we you know I'm I'm still afraid of dying well then there's something wrong with your spiritually speaking because you should not be allowing now and I try to make it plain and blunt we're not stupid idiots to walk out in front of a train and say I'm not afraid of dying no you stupid that's what you are that's as blunt as it can be all right that's tempting God it's not something happened that you're in a wreck or something just goes wrong and you get killed or you know that's not tempting God but when you're doing things like that see you're tempting him and and we're not supposed to do that that's right all right but see death is not to be it's not supposed to be um our uh what the things we're afraid of yeah we're human we're human beings we think of dying you know that even the Lord Jesus hanging or in the garden that the the thoughts of dying was prevalent in his mind and he prayed because he didn't understand it him being God in human flesh he prayed for it to be removed from him all right but yet still he turned around and looked back at it and said all right so be it all right well see then we shouldn't have that fear because that's what's got torment in it that was what I was trying to get across there Wednesday and trying to get it to the point that death can only take me into the presence of God all I I don't think any of us would like to live to be a couple of hundred years old if you do you sure are thinking kind of you know I it would be all right if we could uh remain uh healthy you know and keep the mind that's the one thing I want to keep all right but yet we know that won't happen so we don't want to live that long that's right you know we we we want to we want to do what we doing but my point has been what for 45 or 50 years that I've been trying to get this point across this end time people has a word to fulfill just as every other age had a word to fulfill all right then what is the word to be fulfilled in this age death to be destroyed am right you said said no Rapture Rapture is going away you see that's what we've got our mind on I I'll be glad one of days when we're raptured up well that's all right but remember there's got to be a change before Rapture all right and there's got to be a change in you and I amen see we're going to be changed as we read in a moment the twinkle of an eye when see then at that time it's brought to P death where your sting grave where your Victory you know because is still doing it it's still holding us it still has effect on you and I but it doesn't have any effect upon our soul that's one thing I want you to see you know it it doesn't have any effect upon the spiritual part of mankind right you know the New Birth has taken that away all right but yet it has the effect upon this part of us and that's the part of us that is to be has to come into Redemption all right now in that then we know the day and the hour that we're living and we know the word we must fulfill okay right or else we're going to go by the grave and somebody else is going to do it so why not us do it that's right why can't we believe that we are that part and to do it but now it's like I said you say well now brother D you've been preaching this all yeah because when I saw this message I saw that's what it is right this message is to destroy death all right but we got to find out what it is before it can be destroyed all right the great Apostle Paul would say this corruptible must put on incorruption all right now listen church this shouldn't be something hard to comprehend because you know we as coming out of organized religion and churches and things you know we believed that something was going to happen that we would be redeemed now we might have believed it in the form of of uh going to get a new one you know we might have had all of that involved but we still was thinking about it you know and still to the point of trying to talk about it and and you know you would hear people preach about and and believe that the soul was redeemed so this is not a something something that's a new doctrine it goes all the way back amen all right and see in that then we shouldn't be trying to I think what we're trying to do is we're trying to find a rabbit in a hat right or a bus pulling up or a some form to bring us to a change instead of just going day by day and walking right into it you know as we'll get to it tomorrow this afternoon through the revealed word right right right all right and see then you'll see why that I haven't been like the other most ministers are that just try to tantalize the people satisfy them keep them happy or beat them over the head to make them feel good you know preach CL hire dress clothes Etc you know and look back and see Sister Barbara I told her we're glad to have her back she's been gone for about nearly a month now so she we glad to have her back with us all right now but look what we're looking at after Paul is trying to explain something let's back up and just read the scriptures and just come right down through to a place to look at something that I want us to talk about I want us to talk talk about what is death I remember brother Mo years ago that was probably a 1960 uh I mean 6869 event he said if we don't find out what death is how are we going to know when it's destroyed right and I said amen so that's held on to me ever since then you know to think about but go ahead let's just read some scriptures thank God for the rain that we're getting it's y'all may not need it where you're at but we certainly do around Gillsville but let's read some scriptures and just follow the line and think about now this is what I want you to think about I want you to think about that they back there especially say Paul because of his his great you know prophetic abilities that he would see things and he would speak of it and as I've told you maybe sometimes he would speak of it and and you would think well he surely didn't see it really clear right there well I believe that cuz I believe that's the way God reveals things to you and I all right he'll open a door or a light comes on as we call it and you begin to see things but then after a while it that we find out that's just a background you know and that's why I've always tried to preach to you about former latter rain you realize you you you your former Reign is your teaching rign your latter rain is the quickening but you know as quick as that's quickening to you you know the next day that becomes former because it's just a background for whatever's coming next all right amen so now look at these look at what especially Paul would say and then think about what he is saying right all right so let's read it look all flesh is not the same flesh but there's one kind of Flesh of man another kind of Flesh of Beast and other fishes and other birds there are celestial bodies and there's bodies terrestrial but the glory of celestial is one and the glory of terrestrial is another you have you know you have theophanies you have literal bodies you have things you have um out in the world you have heavenly uh Celestial forms and natural forms and and all kind of things all right there's one glory of the sun another glory of the Moon and another glory of the stars for one different from another star in glory for one star different so also is the resurrection of the dead now why is he talking about moon stars um atmospheres uh flesh uh you know I mean we we all know that the animals are different right and and we know that if you just take the natural of it that there's heavenly bodies celestials and there's Earthly or terrestrial type of forms down here you know there's moons or Stars why would he tie that to and make his outstanding statement and so is the resurrection of the dead now he said it's sown in corruption is raised in incorruption all right that's sensible enough for us to understand what goes down is going to come back up that was one of the Mysteries that we needed because to us in organized religion we had it going down one thing and coming up another right so now it should be turning the light on as to see really what he's dealing with he's dealing with a great thing that in just a minute he'll say I speak to you of a mystery something that has not been made known and remember in the days when Paul was writing these things you had the Pharisees that believed in a Resurrection you had the Sadducees that didn't believe in the resurrection but did believe probably in a final day Resurrection because you know I mean basically all man believes in at least something happens all right but now think about what he's saying describing all of these things then he simply seems to drop to a great understanding so on so is the res resurrection of the dead right amen you know a lot of people back there probably uh talk to him about it but like I said there was the argument among this or among that and and by this time he already knew about you know Paul I mean Jesus saying I am the resurrection and the life he already knew about those things so he was not only speaking to Pharisees and Sadducees about their doctrinal issues he was speaking of things of the bride of Christ as we'd call her and by the time Paul comes along there was probably already doctrines in there because you remember who was it philetus and hus that was uh teaching that the resurrection had passed over in the book of Acts right and he had to deal with that so there was already a lot of things going on so he I guess one day he simply gets the idea and he says says wait a minute these Corinthians and that means correction you know he said they they need a lot of help so I better break this down so then he starts saying so is also the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption simple matters now what I want you to think about you know maybe sometimes I need to preach a little bit on that simple matters in the Bible there's a lot of things that are very simple but yet we make them so deep to me an amazement of brother brandham talking and they ask him uh what is it let's see what was that one U please explain the translation of the Bri you remember that and the questions and answered you know what he said it's just a change y he started talking about it as a simple matter it's just a change all right a great mystery just a change I believe it's going to be so simple until the major part of people is going to miss it because of the Simplicity that's what I believe amen CU it's just simple but look it's SE a natural body is raised as spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body all right so he's expressing about human you know the dead it goes down it comes back up whatever it is going down is whatever is coming back he's not explaining we're going to get a new one all right and look what then he goes to and so what is it written the first man Adam and you're talking about Resurrection do do you understand me he's talking about resurrection and he's done been through the moon the stars the the celestials and terrestrials and yeah right now he's talking about the resurrection and he said s and dishonor raised in honor you know shown in in and uh dishonor raised in you know shown in weakness raised in power so a natural body raised a spiritual body look what he drops back too so it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit now he's got to explain something how be it that was not first which is spiritual now he's not saying that Jesus Christ didn't come first he's talking about creation right right not first how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual Adam came first there was no need of the second Adam to come Jesus Christ unless the first Adam had fallen right all right and look the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the Lord From Heaven now think about what he's he's explaining Resurrection see we could stop right there and and just preach for a long time on that basis that the first man Adam fell and would require Resurrection all right but the second man Adam is the god of Heaven he just went through those things as an example for you and I the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the Lord From Heaven as is the Earthly such are they also that are Earthly and as is the Heavenly such are they also that are Heavenly and what and as we have borne the image of the Earthly we shall also bear the image of the Heavenly explaining Resurrection because without a resurrection you couldn't say corruptible but on incorruption if you think you're going to get you a new body see and don't think much about it there's a big portion of the people of this message still believe that after all the prophet has said about it all right amen a man quotes more than a brother random than I do and yet he believes we're going to get a new body and one of these days some way I tried to listen to it and he brought it around and he done it around this way and it went over that way and it turned back that way and finally after a while it got back together I I I just couldn't follow it it was too spiritual for me I was still too carnal I guess but now look explaining the resurrection yeah is that what he's explaining come on are you with me we're just taking scriptures I like to do this maybe I'll get back to this style one of these days I like to just take scriptures we do that on the on the uh Bible study I love to do that and just read scripture and just talk about it I like to read the scripture and just think about it i' like to just think now Paul you've gone through heavenlies you've gone through everything you've gone through animals you've gone through all of these beings to show us that there's a natural problem then you speak of a resurrection and then you tell us that it's sown and dishonor it's raised in Incorruptible y why Paul are you being so emphatic about it then he explains how that the resurrection can come because that first man Adam went down right amen all right it would do no good to raise him back up right right unless something takes place right so then it would require that the second Adam would come into being and that second Adam the first man would be Earthly but the second Adam would be Heavenly the god of Glory all right we can understand Earthly things but what about Heavenly things amen all right and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the Heavenly look where he's gone from you could go back into Abraham and talk about the stars and the and the things all to go with it but think once he gets that settled look what he says now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither does corruption inherit incorruption if you had to put that life part on there look where you would be facing it you don't you don't read that away read it without the last part I'll get to that in a second flesh and bl blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God we know that one day flesh and blood will set in the Kingdom amen right we know spiritually speaking by the new birth you're not talking about this outward man right and spiritually speaking it's not blood in the Kingdom right it's a new birth amen right to bring us into the Kingdom right all right but Naturally Speaking there will be a day there will be a day come the Flesh and Blood you say Flesh and Blood said wait a minute now I got you because of this well just remember Jesus mentioned flesh and Bone when he raised so don't go that there ain't no blood there i' done been through all of that I've done heard all of that and organized we thought we thought boy that's a great Revelation look at there the blood is gone away and Jesus said touch me cuz the spirit hath not flesh and Bone said see there his blood was done gone Bo that's a great Revelation now that was carnality of mine trying to take scriptures but look flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God all right so now here we are but I I thought we believe that we that this body is going to be redeemed right come on all right so then he says I'll show you a mystery we're going to be changed this kind this human element 16 elements is not going to be what we're talking about it's this body redeemed that we will live in we'll have a body like un to his own glorious body amen yes sir amen you see we think we got got it all figured out cuz look what he's saying he's saying flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom wait a minute we going to get a new body no he's just explained right come on he's just explained corruptible Incorruptible right the same thing going from corruption to incorruption amen all right this Mortal is going to put on immortality right so it's this body redeemed and once it's redeemed it can walk in the Kingdom CU there's not going to be any literal thing in the Kingdom it's going to be this body made Eternal are you with me you said that will still be no that won't be natural that will be a supernatural being right Jesus Christ when he raised was a supernatural being not a natural being right amen all right and we're going to have a body like under his own glor all right amen just thinking about the scriptures and how that we missed it you know you said well now brother there we we believe that we we don't believe in getting a new body we believe in getting this body you know made Eternal okay but see then once this body is resurrected now are we back to where the Paul was on his message when this body is that we die and go by the grave the body will be resurrected right amen well now if the body is resurrected see that's why I love what he says look at the next one 51 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed so when the dead is raised if he was raised back into a mortal body and stayed that it was hey what good would it be you know all of us are going to be changed right right all right now I've told you and I believe it I don't believe that the Dead's going to be raised in corrupted formed bodies I don't believe that now if you do that's all right you do what you want to I believe there resurrection and change will be together that's right I'm talking about those who've died and gone on there's no need bringing them up into uh corruptible because that wouldn't be right see Paul wouldn't be right that you know it goes down corruptible and comes up Incorruptible it's all right amen so now when the dead raise they will raise in a form that is not like death amen they're raised in the form of coming forth like he did amen when he said don't touch me and I'm not yet ascended there was something right in there but in just a little while they could touch him right amen all right but think about it flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom well we got a scripture yeah you got a scripture staring you in the face it's got to be made known right what if it's not did you see neither does corruption inherit incorruption then he makes a statement behold I show you a mystery right a mystery about the resurrection in the things he just described we're not going to get a new one right he just went through this one is going to go down come up Incorruptible right all right but even though it comes up Incorruptible are you following me the dead will rais Incorruptible but they'll have to be changed right you said well why is the purpose of the change well evidently we're going to be a supernatural people right we're not going to be dealing with natural things anymore right amen right a supernatural people like him right a body like unto his own glorious body that we can stand there in that day but you see what I'm talking about look where we'd be if he had have made the statement but we shall be changed all right now once he makes his statement I didn't mean to go this way I just brought the scriptures cuz I wanted to get over the notes but bear with me once he makes his statement that you be changed in a moment of M the mystery in a moment of twinkling of an eye now he describes how it's going to take place when it's going to take place what Etc all right and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed he just said in verse 51 that we'll all be changed right shall all be changed now he's double stating to make sure we don't miss it he's stating that we shall be changed all right CU we're not going to have to die right right amen we're going from corruptible to Incorruptible while we're standing here without a death burial Resurrection things right all right right now watch what he sums it up with and I love this for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality now do you realize what Paul has just done you see I know that everybody don't think the way I think and I'm glad of that but as I said I love to just sit down and look at those scriptures with all of the background of the prophet's message that will keep me straight in my line you know and I won't run off into something looking for a great mystery that nobody else ain't never seen I just look at the scripture Paul says behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed now watch in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the LI Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed now he drops back down come on read your scripture he drops back down from the great height that he just went because the height he just went is Rapture and everything right CU we're going to be changed now I tried to explain something one time and uh I thought people would understand it and you call interpolating maybe it means nothing to M of you but it means a lot to me a lot of things are interpolated or brought into clarification is a better way of saying it for us to have a better understanding now look at the height Paul has taken us to changed the next thing would be the Rapture right right are you with me come on the next thing for the change is the rapture right we all changed so everything be standing here and Paul looks at that and he says oh they're not going to understand that and look what he says for this corruptible must put on incorruption this Mortal must put on immortality now I'm going to say something in a minute that you're going to you know a lot of you going to go hey wi so go ahead so when this corruptible shall I put on incorruption when now he's already brought you to a change I don't know where the Brothers can do it back there or not but I'll get to it in a minute and this Mortal shall I put on immortality then shall be brought to Pisces saying it is written death is swallowed up in Victory y now you say well okay you realize if you took verse 52 bring it put 53 and 54 and 52 are you with me well what does that mean it don't mean nothing to you if you don't understand it but you see he just went to the change then he drop back to tell us how to come to a change hey they done it all right and brother's getting sharp look what you'd be reading behold I show you mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed so you just kind of hold that point for this corruptible must foot on incorrupt there Mor foot on so when this happens that there Mor foot on then shall be brought to P the saying death is swallowed up in Victory in a moment a twinkle of an eye at the life Trump where the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised in and we shall be changed but you see it had to be left the other way so flick it back where nobody won't think we're trying to change things to make it different it has to be left to where it's hidden from the eyes of the wise and prudent but reveal to them that are to receive it in the last days CU we know that this Mortal must put on immortality and we know this corruptible must put on incorruption we know the dead has to raise we know that we all and then we're changed then we go meet the Lord in the air all right see then you can say see when the dead stand here that are raised up when the Mortal puts on immortality the dead are raised brother said if we see him amen we know we're going so we know we're not looking for a resurrection in us because really that Resurrection has brought that to P in us we get to that this evening but we're standing here changed we're going to stand here on this Earth change sister Gil maybe it Split Second who worries the dead can be among us 30 40 days proving the resurrection has come all right I explained the best I could a moment ago that they're not going to raise in some kind of a body that's incorrupt you know corruptible they're going to raise Incorruptible right amen but there's something about that we need to change right amen CU Paul emphatically stated it twice there that we're going to all be changed all right when the dead appears among us we can look at that and say as Paul would say when this corruptible the Resurrection comes so shall have put on incorruption mhm right and this Mortal shall have put on immortality brought up not brought up in an old body come on then at that time shall be brought to P the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory amen if the dead don't raise is that further in the scripture and Paul said if the dead don't raise then where are we and who are we and look what trouble we're in amen right if the dead don't raise I thought we believe that this end time bride I thought we believe that shout voice of an archangel and the trumpet it goes into Thessalonians was to be in our day and that the bride would be the final voice to the final age amen and the voice of the Resurrection would be in the bride believe see that's the resurrection we need okay we don't have to stand here as a resurrection we don't die and jump right back up no but I'm going to make a statement now that I never made so okay when they raise and we see it we're going to be the closest youve ever come to Eternal position they could ever be ain't going to be no dying then you tell me when the dead raise you're going to keep on dying not in Bride form now forget it you can take this for what you want to the bride form there's not going to be any dying when the raise the Resurrection comes amen cuz that is the point to prove Paul says that death is swallowed up in Victory death where's you sting did he go on and say it grave where's you victory that's right would you understand what I'm saying yes you understand what I've been pointing at for 40 something years when that dead raises we going to be there still old yeah right CU remember 30 40 days it's not 30 40 days that we're changed and then we walk off you got to get that in a moment the twinkle of an eye they're raised they appear Among Us the prophet said when you see them said you know you're going yep amen cuz you go tell somebody else you know I go somebody goes and tell Mark said Mark I've seen the dead raise if he ain't born again he can't see it you see the importance of the new birth right amen if we don't have that then we're not going to see it no that's right it'll be another dimension and we can't follow it all right but the dead in Christ you rise be here for a period of time and that 340 days you going to say brother Dale yep we're going to still be getting up and we still going to be eating and we still going to be getting older that stopped you hard is it still going to be getting older but something's going to happen then and we'll be changed but that's after the resurrection see we're not changing in the dead race get in the right order the dead in Christ you rise first and we which are alive and remain are going to be changed and then caught up we talk about the Rapture why we're about the Rapture why not stay on the resurrection that's it cuz they got to be here before we can go any further so the importance is whether or not the bride can become the word that's right right he said but my problem is brother Dale I've got you our problem is the rest of the scripture all right pick it on back up there in Corinthians pull back up to Corinthians now watch so when this corruptible shall I put on incorruption and this Mortal shall I put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory have you ever read that in the Bible roll it up Brothers is the next quote one C which is Isaiah 2589 he will swallow up death in Victory now watch it get right here with us all right right here he will swallow up death in Victory and the Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces amen and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off the Earth for the Lord has spoken it and it shall be said in that day Lo This Is Our God we have waited for him and he will save us redeemed right this is the Lord we have waited for him we be glad and rejoice in his salvation amen right Paul said it's written death would be swallowed up in Victory Isaiah speaking of an end time bride a group of people they can say this is my God this is what we waited for right all right now so he says when death is destroyed you know and remember death is not destroyed until the Resurrection comes right amen right so now you're tying it to the flesh right Last Enemy to be destroyed is death the death to be destroyed is this flesh here but when they raise if you just went with us and some change look where you'd be you'd leave everything out so they come first that's right and when they raise 30 40 days right you remember what I said while ago that'd be the closest you ever got to Eternity y cuz you realize when you see them raised death is defeated only when the Resurrection comes only when that Resurrection ction comes into being would Death be destroyed come on it's not just you and I that no but you see we are the ones who has to bring forth the message so now let's get to that so what is death remember we're not talking about us dying we're talking about when the dead raises death where you sting grave where you Victory it's annihilated in the resurrection of the Bride of Jesus Christ let me put it this way it's proved that it's done it was done back there we know that we know what he done but he's going to apply it in the end time he's going to raise the dead amen now I could spend about three hours talking about the son of man because remember the reason he's called son of man he had the resurrection message right amen Lazarus was proof of it right the son of man hath power on Earth to raise the dead amen so then I thought we believed at least I do that in the end time the bride must be the son of man that's right amen the word made flesh that's right it's going to be her that will call the Dead from the grave I believe when she becomes what she's supposed to be Amen Let me put it a little deeper more when she really really realizes who she is that's it amen that's why everything's waiting on you and I amen yes sir absolutely amen all right so what is death brother brandom says that there's a great big dark hole that's out in front of all of us and said every man is walking into that hole and said it's called Death he said because death is taking us and no matter what we think it took him is taking Mankind through that dark hole of death right he said I want to be like a hero when it comes my time he said I want to say like Paul I know him in the power of his resurrection was that what Paul said a't that kind of an odd statement to be fitting where we're talking about a resurrection every one of us is headed to death what is death life perverted all right we're good at that one we're good on that one right but just remember Revelation go ahead let's read that one number seven brother I'm trying to cut some things out where we can get through and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name that set on him him was death and Hell Followed With Him said hell always followed death power is given over him the part would look at him in his name that set on him was death why would brother brandham State these things look number eight paragraph 117 of the fourth seal none of the other horses or no time that this rider ever rode they didn't have that man had no name there was no name down Through the Ages but now he is called death it's not mentioned see it's revealed now what he is is death going to number nine it's not mentioned in the other times of this writer but said it's mentioned that he's called death but under the Revelation see under the revelation of the line you have to follow get down to the next part it's not under the revelation of the line it's not under the revelation of the man not under the revelation of the ox not under the Revelation come on I'm reading First Age early age this wasn't revealed the next age was the age of the ox which is a Dark Age the middle age it wasn't revealed so as what it was nor the manlike Beast of wisdom representing the reformers Luther and Wesley and so forth it wasn't revealed but in the eagle age the last age the prophetic age when there is to rise prophetic utterance to whom the secrets always come that's right amen going down to the fifth seal number 10 and it says changing these three times and made a Pale Horse and then given a name called death death why would he state so much about it being the fourth the eagle the others didn't call him death now you know they knew what dying was right right you know Paul had spoke of the things that he said when why would it brother random talk about in his message that that eagle would know what death is you remember I've always told you we call death you know well so and so died we took them to the Undertaker and we go to see him and visit him oh he died that's not death because the soul of that individual can't die no matter if he's a sinner his soul doesn't die it goes to another Dimension another place and waits that's right we'll get to that this evening but what is death what killed Eve unbelief see brother brandom was the only one who really caught what death was that's why he'd say he'd say look death is my victory it just carries me into the presence of God I shouldn't fear it it's my helper you remember Wednesday I'm not he said his slave that's what we said Wednesday we read he said he's my slave you know that death can't touch you until God gets to with you it don't make no difference what you could be in the middle of where an atam bomb fell on top of your head and blowed the world apart it can't kill you until God gets true with you so why are you afraid of if he's true with you why you why don't you want to go on to be with him that's what Paul was saying oh no no none of us ain't the only reason I live is for you you my family where's the other it doesn't matter to me why because it was settled a long time ago right at least I know what death to the soul was we were all born in unbelief he that believeth not is condemned already he's dead already if you're not born again you're dead in sin and trespasses right but then see what is death unbelief unbelief that's right now there's two points to cover on that one the reason we have unbelief is because we have not a lot of times been made uh the truth has not been made known that's right all right right now God Winks at that right but one day he commands all to repent all right lack of understanding is still death right amen but yet there's an excuse there that we don't understand and that's where the biggest portion of people of this message are setting right that's why I said 40 years ago the biggest portion of people in message going to die go by the grave you've probably heard that 15 20 times if you've been around here 5 years so if I said it 5 years ago that'd still be well enough but I said it about 40 Sister Christine could probably give you the page number out of the seal book I KN is your name in it Christine okay boy I got that right but listen there's only one death what killed Eve brother around said unbelief now it first killed her spiritually right it first killed her spiritually she went into unbelief but then because of that unbelief she eventually died the first murder was because of unbelief and that was Cain and Abel the first death as we want to call it that way physical so what brother R said what killed Eve he said unbelief he said the life's plague to strike this lady o seean age would be spiritual death be glad to give you that quote spiritual death would strike the lady of see and age and you can pretty well see that amen it's not that we're going to say death being destroyed is to do away with unbelief I don't have no unbelief no more so I can't die now we just been through the whole message explaining that even after we get in this message and all the great things are made known to us until that dead raises right we're going to be dying right all right your Prophet had to die all right so it's not to say well boy bless God one of these days I don't have no unbelief I'm not going to die you're just bluffing it let them get a gun stick of your head you find out that wor Bluff or not that's right right sin is death and sin is unbelief right sin is unbelief lack of understanding is a sin but it's not a sin under death now listen lack of understanding other words we don't know we we haven't heard that's not the sin unto death the sin unto death is when truth is made known right when truth is made known and we face it then we've come to the possibility of death right right and we're going to get to it this afternoon that death in hell will even be cast into the Lake of Fire so you know death's going to be destroyed one day all right but you see unbelief is what's taking you and I down all right that's why I try to give you the quotes I try to help you as much as I can I try to keep preaching on something over and over to try to give you an opportunity to not face it as an unbeliever because I know and realize sometimes when I speak that a lot of people sitting in the congregation are listening are saying I don't believe that or let me put it in the word word I don't understand that that's too deep I mean we just went through the scriptures today reading the scripture but it's too deep this messenger was the one to tell us what death is is that deep you what you're saying is we didn't understand the thing that was killing us we called it denominations and we say but brother Dale don't throw off on them they are good people do not denominations are not good people people in denominations are good people denominations is death well that's all no it ain't all the same why the prophet said I'm not against you and your system you're doing but he said the system of organized religion is what I'm against why because he knew that it was death am maybe the seals had to open before he really seen what that was but he saw death as no man that's why the eagle tells us then what is death it's not dying going to the Undertaker uhuh that's my victory to get me out of here that's something to do away the old age and on my facings and doings and that's this thing to get me in the presence of God Brother D I didn't know we had to conquer death well now you do now you know that we going to have to conquer it now can I back up in the message just a second you was following me a while ago so let's see if you keep following when the dead raises when the dead is raised and appears Among Us I said you're the closest you'll ever be to Eternity without actually being there you kind of at least grinned about it whether you believed it or not I think most of you did all right so then for about 30 40 days somebody let me put it this way the dead is not going to raise until the Bride of Jesus Christ conquers death that's right the dead ain't going to raise until till the death is conquered here in the flesh that's why I said it like I did when the Resurrection comes there won't be no death after then to the Bride of Jesus Christ why because death will have already OT sting swallowed up you agreed with that a moment ago but can you agree that we are the ones that has to be that we have to know what death is for to be able to destroy it that's right and death is our unbelief doubting wondering if a dumb donkey tells you the truth you ought at least say Amen right amen that's right the truth is what you're talking about amen if I die and go to hell let it be said one thing for since I've been in this message and you know it the takes are there to prove it I have fought for one thing you and I have a message in this day of something that we've got to make manifest amen we have been delivered to message by the prophet that's right we have the holy spirit from God to reveal it am but it's up to you and I to take it amen and get away from our little unbelief or Petty ideas he said no I don't I don't well why did you think that hell was eternal where'd you get that at ain't in the Bible right but you know what a lot of people say the Bible says every tub was set on its own bottom mama told me that Grandpa told me that Uncle I know it's in there no ain't in there can't tell the difference in the season except the shedding of the trees but of the leaves that is a change in the season come on but we thought that was in the Bible better to put your seed in the belly of a than put it on the ground that ain't in the Bible but yet we swore by it there's the unbelief we'll pick up this afternoon and go a little further okay come ahead Brothers Let's stand what is death unbelief as long as there's unbelief there will be death but you know one day death it even itself will be destroyed it's not that we're sick because of unbelief we're sick because of the original unbelief in the garden it may be that God is using that to bring us into line right but I hope you take this message and think about it I wanted to go a little different way and had it wrote to go that way but that's all right I went the way of I believe it Paul was talking about a resurrection and he said when that Resurrection comes then is brought to P the saying death where you sting and Grave where is your Victory then he goes on down below there in what in the next verse or something we have all things through Jesus Christ you you and I our problem is see we know too much I didn't say revealed I said no too much I wish I had revealed what I know that's why I still have questions all right why because I don't know everything but I don't mind telling you what I do know amen I believe it what we got brother I love him amenah I love why he first and P just my what is death unbelief when you do away with unbelief you'll do away with death yes I first love me and just Sal but some of the brothers coming up Sister s and is facing some hard things and in on our body amen and they keep telling her this and telling her that but what we're want to do is just pray and believe yes amen right yes and just believe it amen any of the rest of you like to come just stand around and to just believe that God is going to take care of everything amen they can tell you all of the different things that wrong but yet we know who can take care of the whole thing amen so we're going to pray with her we're going to give her a prayer cloth and just tell her to take this with you and you just keep it all right and you remember it listen I know her

be Lord what a desire in our heart we love you father in Jesus name he our sister has something she wants to say I want to talk about the accident um two weeks to the day um I want you to hear the Lord up in it and I want your continued prayers the car was hit head on Kendrick and two other buddies were coming from the movies and they were trying to go get something to eat and the young female she's 24 years old her name is christe she hit them head on the impact was so hard that it drove them into the cement medium the driver Zach you've heard that name before that's his childhood buddy um he has a bum knee the passenger Tron he has a broken wrist Kendrick was in the back and he has a broken sternum chest wall contusion and we our backs hurt and our legs get broken what have you the chest wall Fusion you can't raise your arms it hurts every movement hurts pray that he doesn't get a cold this is cold and flu season but they transported him down to Grady and um we're there 12 hours and then one hand doesn't know what the other's doing the nurse wanted the um urine specimen and uh the doctor didn't know that but anyway I went out to check to see if he can get something to eat and they said oh yeah cuz we're getting ready to release him medical responds to pain only they don't respond to the fact that this was a head-on collision and that you need to check everything from head to toe so I told her I said you better check that urine specimen it looks suspect to me before you do that that urine specimen looked just like iced tea it was only then they had taken X-rays and they did blood work but it was only then that they did the CT scan which dis discovered the broken chest wall other than that they were getting ready to release him to go home the Lord all up in there um when I got to the scene of the accident the cop said ma'am calm down they all had their seat belts on and there was a Bible in the car praise God and that's that's Zach Zach um the driver tried to go over and get help the girl get out and the handle broke off in his hand and he heard his buddy over there hollering on the ground cuz Zach and Tron got out of the car and were able to walk around Kendrick didn't understand why he was screaming but he un buckled his seat Bel and he fell out of the car he was on the ground and Zach went over to him Bible under this arm hand on Kendrick and praying just the Lord all up in there um Kendrick had to stay for a couple of days at Grady just pray for us because Grady is number one in trauma and burn but God help us with Administration we have to go back down there to get Ruckers and ID who can go down there with a broken chest wall but anyway continue to pray for us it's a long road um there's no quick fix there's no medication for it except pain no brace no surgery and just to get up and out and down is just a hard thing the first morning I didn't I didn't realize he had to actually swing his legs up over his head to cause momentum to get out of the bed we have a bar now but just continue to remember us it's going to be a long road Kroger doesn't offer light work so that's what they're saying light work so he's going to be out of work for a while while that bone heals so just continue to remember make sure we make sure we we'll be much in prayer because that's what it takes right anybody else before we go Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this day and we thank you for the testimony our sisters given of how you took care of Kendrick there Lord because it could have been very easily there anything could have punctured his lungs or his heart or anything from that injury that would come there and we ask you to just bless him and take care of him Lord and to keep his old coals and things away from him and just make it all well we love you and we thank you we commit everything to you now and guide us in Jesus name amen your dismiss
