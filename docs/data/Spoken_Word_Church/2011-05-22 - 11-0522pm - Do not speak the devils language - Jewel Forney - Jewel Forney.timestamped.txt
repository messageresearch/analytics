[0:10] jesus said here i said to you they have
[0:12] out of word
[0:13] a man shall speak they shall give an
[0:16] account in the day of judgment right
[0:18] right
[0:19] now the prophet exodus and by the bible
[0:22] hey the bible says jesus say let your
[0:25] yes be yes
[0:27] and nobody knows
[0:29] some people got a yes and enough for
[0:31] everything
[0:32] some people know everything
[0:34] if you ask them a question they just
[0:36] knew it
[0:37] yeah it right or wrong but they got to
[0:39] know it
[0:41] how did it
[0:42] show it anyway
[0:55] that will become
[1:10] oh
[1:19] you know
[1:20] one thing you know joking about maybe
[1:22] something that's fiction a fiction joke
[1:25] but you know
[1:26] but to tell something that's true that
[1:28] happened you know and the things
[1:31] happening it's just funny in life
[1:34] you know worse you know i mean this
[1:35] thing happened for that funny life i
[1:37] tell the story of my own uh i don't want
[1:39] them i got the attitude i was looking in
[1:41] the mirror i weighed about 270 pounds
[1:44] and i was flexed
[1:47] there must have been a spirit talking to
[1:49] me
[1:50] because i saw myself like tony atlas
[1:56] and i was just standing in front of that
[1:57] mural
[1:59] and the devil was saying look at this
[2:02] you're a tony atlas
[2:07] and my wife walked in there and she says
[2:09] to me
[2:10] i hope you don't think you look good
[2:18] you know
[2:35] he said he's in anything
[2:38] not the joker would want to see god will
[2:41] make you give and account for every
[2:43] other word that you speak
[2:45] do not do that the bible says that you
[2:47] have to give an account for every other
[2:50] word so
[2:51] what what kind of people we ought to be
[2:53] people that frankly stern love and sweet
[2:57] kind
[2:58] never
[2:59] never a bunch of nurses
[3:01] always going along so we got to bring it
[3:04] to the point that lord i'm trying to get
[3:06] my mind in order i'm trying to keep
[3:09] myself here the best thing for me to
[3:11] know if i don't see it in the word let
[3:13] me leave it alone
[3:15] we don't want to get in to that but the
[3:18] question is
[3:19] just evening young people
[3:21] all people just saying the only thing
[3:23] that we got that we know is true
[3:25] is the holy spirit
[3:27] we can hear these outer words out of
[3:30] this come here uh jesus is coming on a
[3:32] uh this year and somebody tried to put a
[3:34] date on it somebody said he's out in the
[3:36] desert at least they don't even go out
[3:38] there and believe that he said that's
[3:40] out of work how did they say he's in the
[3:42] secret bride trent chamber he tell us
[3:44] not to even believe in things
[3:47] why because where he is he's not in the
[3:49] secret bride trainer he's not in the
[3:52] desert he's in you
[3:54] so we just need ask god to open the eyes
[3:57] of my heart
[3:58] and let me see jesus christ in me
[4:01] hey you know we need to see jesus christ
[4:04] i mean the only way i want to see jesus
[4:05] christ i got to find somebody with the
[4:08] baptism that holy ghost right i gotta
[4:10] find somebody that got the word on the
[4:12] inside
[4:27] we don't realize the significance of
[4:29] somebody you know sometimes we got
[4:31] somebody that we're against
[4:34] you know and then you know we don't
[4:36] realize what we say
[4:38] and we shouldn't we should if we got
[4:39] somebody with just we need to get on our
[4:41] needs and pray to god to take and give
[4:44] me creating me a clean heart so i can
[4:46] deal with it so we'll see that person
[4:48] that we're against and the first thing
[4:49] we shake his head what we say
[4:52] god bless you well you should not bless
[5:16] you know what he's gonna be blessed and
[5:18] you think oh why you ain't dealing with
[5:20] it because you keep blessing him how did
[5:28] because if you keep saying bless him
[5:30] he's going to keep on getting good of
[5:32] him
[5:34] out of your own mouth
[5:35] you need to curse or bless somebody
[5:37] right how did the old testament i said
[5:39] sometimes if you know we need we need to
[5:41] do this what are we doing now yeah we we
[5:43] we dedicate our children we dedicate
[5:45] them to the lord we say lord i want you
[5:47] to put a blessing on this child i look
[5:49] through life in here we try to dedicate
[5:51] them and put a blessing on them how do
[5:53] we try to dedicate their blessings our
[5:55] main word international word is god
[5:57] bless you
[5:59] and the people just keep getting blessed
[6:02] and then they just keep on getting
[6:03] blessed because why it's in your mouth
[6:13] something that you don't like you got to
[6:15] say lord give me the divine love that i
[6:18] can overcome this spirit you've got to
[6:20] speak it so your body can come to it
[6:22] right honey it don't just happen by
[6:25] accident a chance you've got to speak
[6:27] the word right
[6:30] we we got to come to that point you know
[6:32] how we get a bad service
[6:35] you know what korea had a bad service
[6:37] the mouth
[6:39] right
[6:40] and i'm so tired
[6:42] because i'm sitting back in the office
[6:44] i'm getting asleep so good
[7:01] what talking about here they speak their
[7:03] way out of it i don't feel like i just
[7:05] feel like tonight after they think the
[7:07] church is going to be so down speak that
[7:10] right
[7:11] speak that and you will create an
[7:12] atmosphere to pull the spirit of god
[7:15] down i have no idea you come back in
[7:17] here
[7:18] on a sunday evening have you done it
[7:20] real good and the only thing that
[7:21] everybody on their mind a big
[7:24] fluffy king-sized mattress
[7:54] but the point of it is the people cursed
[7:56] your own self right it ain't god putting
[7:58] it on you god has healed you but they
[8:00] just how you feeling i'm sick
[8:03] but thinking this sickness to say that
[8:05] you got to curse your own self
[8:08] because you've got power either out of
[8:10] your mouth to
[8:23] is that my power in your words and we
[8:26] all got to come through that
[8:28] and i got to go do that right lord
[8:31] let me get control of my tongue
[8:33] and the only thing that can control the
[8:35] tongue is the baptism of the holy ghost
[8:39] i preached a message years ago
[8:42] no nobody ever preaching him but the one
[8:44] thing i the message i picked years ago
[8:47] that what out what adam lost control of
[8:50] was the power of this
[8:52] term because adam was created to speak
[8:55] the word
[8:56] and adam lost control of the power of
[8:58] the speech
[9:00] right adam should have been able to
[9:01] speak and the devil should have left
[9:04] right right adam had power to get rid of
[9:07] the devil right now do you realize that
[9:09] you're right out of them had power to
[9:11] get rid of the devil adam i'm giving you
[9:13] dominion over the fishes i'm giving you
[9:15] dominion on the peace of the field i'm
[9:17] giving you the media adam the word of
[9:19] god is in your mouth
[9:27] he had to probably get rid of it
[9:29] i don't want you to exist anymore
[9:32] it wouldn't have been no such thing as a
[9:33] devil right he had the word to speak
[9:35] about existence exactly how god gave him
[9:38] that dominionship
[9:39] now god has given you the same
[9:41] diminishing he giving you power over the
[9:43] flesh over the devil and over the world
[9:46] now how you gonna overcome the world the
[9:48] same way that jesus did jesus had to
[9:50] speak the word get behind me say get the
[9:53] head it is written amen how did he had
[9:55] to speak the word i didn't in order for
[9:58] us to get rid of the word the world has
[10:00] bought enough we got to start speaking
[10:02] the word holly young people if you
[10:04] battle with rock and roll music you
[10:06] battle with lush you fighting with
[10:07] internet pornography or whatever it is
[10:09] only when you can help them come over
[10:11] come here you got to raise up and make
[10:13] them in your mind greatness in me the
[10:15] heathens in the world you've got to
[10:17] start telling your faith
[10:20] you want your body amen
[10:23] exactly i told you no
[10:26] i believe i told this the last time i
[10:27] was here
[10:28] but didn't i tell you
[10:30] i said when i was a when i was out here
[10:33] before i was saved one of my main things
[10:36] i was a football player fan
[10:38] i was a baseball fan
[10:40] you know i didn't do nothing never
[10:42] really interest me
[10:45] i was into boxing
[10:48] i love boxing
[10:50] it just wanted everybody at the end
[10:51] today oh
[10:52] i love boxing i mean i
[10:55] i just love boxing
[10:57] and uh and one of my greatest
[11:00] the most man i admired the most when i
[11:02] was in the world and i was into the
[11:04] boxing
[11:05] the man i
[11:07] gave the most respect for
[11:09] he was the coldest of the greatest
[11:13] all right anybody right old man
[11:15] muhammad ali
[11:17] and i said what made him the greatest
[11:19] it ain't because somebody told him he
[11:21] was great
[11:23] and then because somebody educated him
[11:25] he was great
[11:26] what made him great he declared himself
[11:29] right
[11:30] he told himself i am the greatest
[11:34] right
[11:36] that's all you have to do tell yourself
[11:38] you don't have to be defeated by
[11:40] circumstances all right
[11:55] everybody had their opinion about that
[11:58] everybody said what was he talking about
[12:00] what made him think he's the greatest he
[12:02] believed it right
[12:03] he believed that he was the greatest
[12:06] and because he believed it his body was
[12:09] a common subject to the confession
[12:13] now confession is something you don't
[12:14] change right so when muhammad ali got
[12:17] defeated
[12:19] he never accepted the defeat
[12:23] he never got down in the body and he
[12:25] never went back on his testimony
[12:28] he got up because he did not realize he
[12:31] was being beat
[12:34] he didn't realize that he was defeated
[12:36] right so when he got back up since he
[12:38] didn't realize anything he declared
[12:40] himself i'm still great right
[12:43] you said but man you just got beat but
[12:44] he didn't know it right
[12:46] how can you get beat by the devil when
[12:48] you don't know it right how the only
[12:50] reason you get beat you know you got
[12:52] beat and you get up and you can thank
[12:54] that the devil knocked you down honey
[12:55] have you ever done this to me i'm a
[12:57] muhammad ali
[12:58] he did not confess i've been beat
[13:02] he got up with the confession i'm the
[13:05] you greatest
[13:06] and he didn't even know what you know
[13:09] he didn't even have the message
[13:11] he believed in the different bible did
[13:13] you believe
[13:14] but he had faith in what he believed
[13:17] and he took his confession and he made
[13:19] his body come subject to that right
[13:22] and only not only did muhammad ali
[13:27] believe it that he was the greatest
[13:29] comer
[13:31] but muhammad ali would be fighting
[13:34] if you ever seen him been fighting
[13:36] she stand up in your mouth i'm glad i
[13:37] can beat you
[13:39] he always be leaning on a man like this
[13:42] and you think he's just leaning he's not
[13:44] resting he's telling this man in his ear
[13:47] i'm the greatest
[13:51] he'll leave it in i'm the greatest
[13:53] you've ever seen
[13:56] what is he doing he's not only telling
[13:58] himself he's great he's making his his
[14:01] opponent believe that he's a great guy
[14:04] he put his idea in his mind honey he's
[14:07] making his opponent testify that he's
[14:10] aggressive
[14:13] george foreman said when he fight
[14:14] muhammad ali
[14:17] george foreman says
[14:19] he would hit muhammad ali with
[14:20] everything he had
[14:22] he's i was giving muhammad ali my best
[14:25] and he says to enjoy it
[14:29] as you foreign
[14:34] oh honey he's not hard as you can hit
[14:37] george
[14:38] oh george are you hitting like a girl
[14:41] he hit and what he
[14:54] in the world you've got a right to
[14:56] confess
[15:04] he made his opponent
[15:06] confess that he was grace
[15:08] and i looked at it i look at hypocrisy
[15:11] at the end of the day they brought
[15:12] george foreman they broke ken norton
[15:14] they brought speech they brought home
[15:16] they brought all those former fighters
[15:18] that he didn't fight it and he sat down

[15:36] whole table he's hiding the greatest and
[15:38] they want
[16:06] i am the greatest
[16:08] greatest he is in me
[16:11] the heathens in the world
[16:14] would not
[16:15] he would not accept defeat
[16:17] on any grounds
[16:19] he did not decept defeat or any ground
[16:22] he would not even let his dream
[16:25] yeah he would not even let a dream
[16:26] defeated
[16:29] he told this young man he says
[16:32] you know how we all have dreams
[16:34] we all get big ideas
[16:36] muhammad ali one year
[16:39] he said if you ever have a dream
[16:42] and you go in your subconscious and you
[16:44] go to sleep
[16:46] and if you ever dream
[16:48] that you beat me and knock me out
