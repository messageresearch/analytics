chauffeuring him and and getting him around and and get him to church mainly get him here and get him back home so uh thank each and every one of you for doing that and god bless you for your effort we appreciate that also um you know sometimes when you i was on this started on this series so when i went to brother richard's sunday i said well i'll just kind of hit on it and just see you know how it goes because uh you don't hear a lot of preaching just on the son of man um now they'll hit it in sermons but just to go ahead and preach who he is well after the service was over i kind of put part one and part two together from last couple sundays ago and one brother said you know what he said i've been in the message forever how much longer he'd been and how long he'd been in the message and he said i never understood the dispensational change of the son of god son of man and who the son of man was back in the back in you know 2000 years ago and he said i really appreciate it so if i went for one person that's all we're looking for we're looking for the last one right we're looking for the last 12 we're looking for the last one all right or the last hundred we're looking for the last one and we want that last one to grow up in god we want somebody you know when somebody comes to you and said i never saw that now i see it well see that's a revelation and that'll stick with him forever that will actually help him put things together maybe that that he'd had a a a mystery about before because i thought all the mystery is supposed to be revealed in the in the end time and as we read here that we're going to read that the son of man is to be revealed not to just be not to just be here but to be revealed who he is what's he doing here and what's he he's taking us home so john 1 let's read before that let's bow our heads the heavenly father thank you for this morning that you give us lord that's truly a resurrection that we honor the resurrection of the empty tomb lord it may be over there in israel but lord you came out of that empty tomb and then you came into a heart of people and as brother bob was talking about that throne now is in our hearts it's not in a place sitting somewhere it's in our the throne room of our heart and lord today i pray that you will speak to us through that throne room lord not just be intellect or intelligence lord but let it be lord of revelation let it be the knowledge of god that takes over and gives us lord complete revelation of what's going on because we need it in this end time as brother bob was talking about the daniel 70 weeks putting all the pieces together lord because we're going to read a quote from your prophet this afternoon that's going to thrill the people lord and it's going to get us thinking lord a little bit different than we thought before father forgive us of our sins bless this day continue to bless our pastor and raise him up for your honor and glory lord it was good to see him in the pulpit last weekend lord we pray that you just bless him now and take care of each and every one of us in the furthermore service in jesus name amen john 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god all right the same was in the beginning with god how many people we got ran around here one all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from god whose name was john john the baptist the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light he was not that light he was sent to bear witness of the light amen doesn't that sound familiar in the end time there was another elijah prophet that came in the end time to introduce not be him not be the not be the the the son of man but be a son of man revealing the son of man that was the true light who go back to jesus the son of man which lightly lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not so listen if the world didn't know him then then when we go to the have the son of man revelation in the end time the world is not going to know who he is all right that's what we're looking at this whole series is taking the characteristics if we believe that the son of man is supposed to come back and be revealed in the end time we got to know what his characteristics is we got to know what he's going to act like when he gets here amen or we'll miss him because they they thought they knew what he looked like back then and what he was going to act like but he came exactly the way the scripture said but not according to their denomination and that's the same way in the end time and we'll read that quote a little bit later on maybe tonight or this afternoon he came into his own and his own received him not the world didn't know him he came to his own they didn't know him he was alone but look but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god that's me and you the baptism of the holy ghost amen even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man in other words not born between a man and a woman but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated in the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word we want to look again i'll read genesis 3 15 in a minute but look thing right there where's and the word was made flesh everybody got that now the son of man the son of man was the word made flesh he was word before he was flesh now the difference in me and you is being a son of man our sons and daughters of god we come different from that we came flesh fallen nature first and then the word found us or called our name and then we became the word made flesh when we received the new birth jesus christ didn't need a new birth he was the birth amen so he came with the word inside of him we did not we came lost contrary we were contrary to the word how in the world you going to say would come here with something if it were contrary to it amen we have representation you got to see that and the representation is in the word and the word is the seed the only seed that god has is the word he has no natural seed he doesn't need a natural seed he says let there be amen so now look we come to a time though and we'll look at it in just a second when we get into genesis 126 man but think about this i was speaking on this in in kentucky and it kind of the thought came to me as much as i read genesis 1 26 donny something came unfolded sunday because what there was adam you know eve was supposed to do exactly what mary did eve's commission was be it unto me according to thy word adam spoke it he produced it right so what happened in the second adam or or christ what happened here comes the angel and says the holy ghost is going to overshadow you and the holy ghost is a man we know that that's the man christ jesus him to god himself and what'd she say be unto me according to that word she had to say that and then it was placed in a womb and what did she do she produced the child and that's exactly brother brown said that eve was supposed to bring the body of jesus and that's what he was supposed to do just step into it and then we're all supposed to leave eternal then whatever whatever adam would speak eve would produce it and we'd be there that would be the sons and daughters of god right you say oh how's that going to be in the end time well listen brother brown said god's going to prove that this eve won't fall now who's the even this hour that's the bride of jesus christ and how did you come into the body you had a bride person life comes through the body someone had to talk to you a preacher had to preach to you and he had to preach the holy ghost to you and listen you might get born again if the preacher don't have the holy ghost but he really needs the holy ghost for you to get it because seed life comes through the body amen so that's where the seed the word comes from that's why many many many preachers if you you got to be careful brother brown said money women in popularity those are three things that will mess you up more than anything why because you are planting a seed into a woman the bride but it's spiritual if you keep it separate you're okay but if you live real close to that be careful many women in popularity that's what brother brown said the three things you need to watch out for because there's an anointing there listen eve had an anointing she was anointed to do a job she just took that anointing and listened to who listen to the beast or listen to satan before she listens to her husband is that what the prophet of god said she came out from behind adam amen and that's what happens to me and you we come out from behind adam and we get in big trouble amen stay with this second adam stay with this son of man because what was the first adam he was the son of god he wasn't the son of man listen if he would have been the son of man he could have saved eve he could have saved eve he would have been a savior if he would have been the one the word was made flesh if he would have been the son of man he could have saved eve but he wasn't he was the son of god he was created in genesis 1 26 man was put into the 2 7 man wasn't a savior though he could have complete control he wasn't a savior he wasn't a healer he had not did not have those attributes the only attribute he had was is to control the world okay but now see by the power of you and of you and me receiving the new birth see he didn't receive a new birth the first adam the second adam didn't receive a new birth he was the new birth but all the sons and daughters that born after that had to receive a new birth which gave us power as the son of man because genesis 8 i mean romans 8 says what we're heirs and joint heirs with jesus christ okay so this is where we're going to and i'll read you a quote this afternoon and i'll just kind of quote it but i'll read it and it's in there where brother branham says this son of man revelation will come in a different way the son of man revelation will come in a different way that's why you have to separate it that's why you have to keep it separate you sure it's the same person yes it's the same person but look the same person went into martin luther and he sat in a pub drank a beer and smoked a pipe and talked about god and got people born again under justification same holy ghost but me and you can't do that why god has moved on god has moved on to a higher revelation and we'll read that they got partial revelation in the church ages that's why this is important who is this son of man that's why jesus asked that question who do men say that i the son of man i am and they told him the revelation of the son of god so he said okay i'll build my church on that we'll talk about in a minute so let's go to genesis 3 15 because we know what happened remember the fall happened all right and it messed everything up it messed us up it didn't mess god up and messed us up it made it to where his attribute could be displayed he could be a savior he could be a healer he could be a redeemer and all these different things and then god after the fall says what i will put enmity i will not adam anymore i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed now that's natural seed because look natural seed had been planted everybody got that when he spoke this natural seed had come into into view eve was already right here pregnant with adam and the beast right so now i will put enmity between then the woman in between thy seed serpent seed and her seed natural seed because she's going to receive a natural seed she didn't she didn't receive the seeds she was supposed to receive when you come down here to mary she received the seeds you're supposed to receive without the instrumentality of a man it was the holy ghost amen that overshadowed her and in her will be jesus christ the son of man amen you're all right genesis 3 15 i will put enmity i'm in other words i'm going to do it there will be no more covenants you will i will or you don't you do i'm just going to do it abraham i'm going to save you abraham i'm going to put you in the land i will i will i will look in genesis about 14 15 16. i will i will and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel all right let's go now so that's genesis 3 15. that is something coming through a woman to flesh and god's going to use that that's a promise of the son of man a woman is going to receive a seed with no instrumentality of man she's going to say revelation be it unto me according to thy word or let's take an updated revelation brother branham that ain't nothing but the truth that's a little heady right same thing god came down and said okay whatever you want mary was told she's gonna have a child how can i have a child knowing no man but when the when the lord when the lord or when gabriel explained it to her she said okay be it unto me according to my word or gabriel that ain't nothing but the truth amen so we see that now in the end time and that's what you and i are going to have to work with we work in that same realm lord be it unto me according to that word lord let it be me i'll do it that ain't nothing but the truth preacher that ain't nothing but the truth try that sometimes but it comes to a woman but it but remember the word was made flesh the word was spoke back into in eternity right john 1 1 was not written 2 000 years ago it was all written for the foundation of the world so that word was made flesh through a woman because through a woman came to fall ma'am okay but not by sex by spoken word because the spoken word is the original seed all right deuteronomy 18 15 proving again that god's going to come in flesh all right god's going to come in flesh the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee now listen what is the son of man you say okay that's jesus in it no what does son of man mean prophet just remember son of man means prophet prophesy son of man we'll read it in ezekiel this afternoon ezekiel son of man prophesy tell israel why well that's that's kind of what jesus did didn't he he came down here and he prophesied he told us all the things that was going to happen and people people were going to kill him and then he was going to come back in three days and all these things and he was not a prophet he was the prophet moses was a prophet the lord jesus was the prophet so he was the son of man because he was born not of a man all right the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy brethren look like unto me so now what was moses moses was flesh moses was a flesh man a prophet so that's what he's prophesying that there's going to come one just like him a prophet that's capital p in the bible if you see the prophet there like unto me unto him you shall hearken so there's another flesh man so now we're going to jump several thousand years to matthew 16 verse 13 and that flesh man is standing on earth he's been on earth for about 30 odd years at this moment and jesus came into the coast accessory of philippines asked the disciples whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say they were john the baptist some elijah jeremiah or one of the prophets and he said unto them but whom do you say i am simon peter answered said thou art the christ the son of the living god the son of the living god not son of man and jesus answered and said unto him listen if they would have known who that man was they would have been there during the whole time remember they scattered the night of the crucifixion that over the day of the crucifixion they wanted nobody around him peter denied him three times they were scared to death to not even be to not even be associated with jesus they've been with him for three and a half years and all of a sudden they're like we don't know that guy we're gonna hide in the bushes and see what's going on jesus answered and said on him blessed are thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven so it's not a it's not a carnal revelation it's a spiritual revelation right that's why everybody says he built his church onto different things well brother brown said he built it on a spiritual revelation and we'll read that quote here in just a minute and i say unto thee thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church this revelation i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven so peter had a little power given to him because he was going to be the spokesman on the day of pentecost but let's read this quote from thirst 1965. to know him as life the person christ himself not comparing it's a revelation that god built his church upon all right and if we don't build upon that same church the bible says abel by faith and faith is a divine revelation it's not just an aha moment it's something that sticks with you something that's part of you and it'll still be a part of you listen you can't get a revelation and then lose it not a true one from god you can't get a true revelation from god and it become a part of you and it sparked something in your heart you know you might well you know what you might humanly forget about the revelation because you're human beings but you know what it's always there and if somebody says something it pops right back up amen i know it's happened to you it's happened to me but now if we get some thoughts in our mind and they don't ever come back that was your thought amen best that it don't come back best that you bury it in the sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered again i've had a few of them haven't you bro john yeah uh-huh some of them i don't want them no more i don't even want to write them down because i want to remember them no more the revelations i thought i had all of us all of y'all that went through the denominations and swore on this and swore on that and swore on father son holy ghost and swore on the baptism and swore on it yeah that wasn't your revelation not from god it wasn't and if we don't build upon that same church the bible said abel by faith and faith is a divine revelation see faith is a divine revelation look this whole thing is built upon the revelation then and unless this is revealed to you jesus said i thank thee father thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and revealed to the babe such as we'll learn now see now the whole thing look is built there you've got to know the person not an idea not something wrote down on a piece of paper but a divine revelation of the person now who is that person the son of man you got to know that jesus christ in flesh died for you and that he released that son of god and it came inside of you called the holy ghost everybody got that okay that's the way you got to see it it's like bob said this today if you don't go through justification saying catching baptism holy ghost i don't see how you can get the holy ghost i don't because it's required amen all right let's look at the next one what is the vision 1956. this was in spindale north carolina that's the paper brother joe joe green lives he was probably miss henry was probably brother henry green when his daddy was probably sitting in this meeting in 1956 i guarantee you was you see the bible said the prophet said there'll be a day that will not be neither light nor dark but in the evening it shall be light now i want you to watch this now remember this afternoon we're going to talk about a different way the son of man is going to be revealed in a different way all right listen now watch this though now when the holy spirit first fell on the church pentecost 2000 years ago upper room acts 2 38 it was in the eastern people in jerusalem that's where the holy ghost fell and great signs and wonders were done by the church in the early pentecostal age of the early church then the next round of apostles then come in the catholic church then 1500 years then the lutheran and then from then on down it's been a day now roll it on up a little bit please so everybody see and then from then and then from then on down it's been a day where the light went out and it's been a daylight enough that you could see that jesus was the son of god not son of man jesus was the son of god you should repent acts 2 38 repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ with your mission in remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost what is the holy ghost son of god all right you should repent but the real bright light of the holy ghost has never shined through these ages now see if you don't if you don't balance that right it'll be like the group that says well you nobody got had the holy ghost until the end time well that's not true that's not true they all had the same holy ghost it was promised in in paul's age all the way up to to now but they only got a portion of it almost went out he said but the real bright light of the holy ghost has never shined through these ages certainly the bible said it wouldn't why because these prophets says what in the evening time it shall be light gross darkness will be upon the earth and all these different prophecies in the old testament just don't ever do away with the old testament as the prophet said it wouldn't just as sure as he said they couldn't believe because isaiah said there hasn't been light because the prophet said there look scroll that all the way up let me let's read that look there's been enough light to know that you ought to do right and wrong that's the holy ghost that's your spiritual rudder amen there's been enough light to know that you believed on the resurrection of the lord jesus accept him as personal savior put your name on the church book and live the good life but as far as signs and wonders in the direct rays of the sun shining it hasn't been since pentecost in the revealing of who the son of man that's the son of god revelation right there when jesus stood and said peter this is what i'll build my church on and the gates of hell will not prevail against it that's what he built his church on believe on the resurrection believe the lord jesus came up enough life to know that you believed on the resurrection you ought to do right and wrong and all these other things up there that's the son of god revelation through the church ages got him in the body gave them a little bit of maybe some of these virtues but not a lot brother branham you remember in the um what was it in the dark ages he said for them just to say they were christians they got killed he said just enough of the holy ghost to get them in the body because what happened was a lot of the soldiers received the holy ghost too i believe when they saw them when they saw the believers walking into that lion's den and just praising god and worshipping the lord and those soldiers threw down well they might not have known nothing but they believed in what those people believed in believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved that is a revelation for god so loved the world that he sent his only begotten son that whosoever shall believe in him what shall not perish but have everlasting life there's your son of god revelation that's to there's enough light to know that you ought to do right and wrong i kind of like that that that kind of sets the stage but remember it's the same holy ghost it's just the difference of the word not the different word i was thinking uh brother samson sheddie sent me a message this morning they are just now translating the church age book in one of their languages in in india just now what we've had for 40 years or longer 50 years what we cherish and read and listen i've got about five copies of them i like my church age book they're just now getting them now whose fault is that i stepped back there and i said it's our fault it's our fault they didn't get those i mean translations have been forever and they're just now getting translation of of the church age book i just it's unbelievable but brother brown said he said you'll get we'll give an account if we don't get this message out to the people you and i will give an account because we didn't go get the message out to the community and instead of going across the world all right so there's been enough light so let's go to this question son of god is who put it up please because i asked them the same question like brother dale asked years and years ago it's when you say son of god i asked him in in kentucky i said when you say son of god who do you who you know you let you put that title out because jesus said who is this son of man uh who do you say are the son of man i am so he put the title out but he also there was many that said son of god you think well that was jesus no that wasn't jesus first the son of god was the creator the one that stood before the foundation of the world that went out of god as i was trying to you really you have to get a revelation to understand that how god can move himself over and still be this person here not do away with this one right here amen not do away with the almighty the the great one that covers all space time and eternity but listen as i was telling them in kentucky god didn't write the bible so he could explain to himself who he was he wrote the bible to explain himself to me and you and he had to write it so that somebody would catch it or he'd be an awful father he'd be an awful person to write something so mysterious that nobody can get it he had to write it to where it we could understand what it was so first was god jehovah and out of him let's just picture now a little drama i was i think i may have this quote again remember where brother brown said the first creation was god himself now boy you're talking about some furrows in the brain of those theologians they were probably going god created himself well i'm telling you that's what the prophet said the first creation was god himself what do you say we got to go back to creation listen a car has always been in this earth a computer these benches everything you see is minerals in this earth and was here at the flood car was here the whole time it just took the intelligence of a man to form or create put the pieces together that's what god's doing he's putting the pieces together because you know what go back and even go back in well go way back before the wheel go back in and say car and they go what like naaman chariots jocelyn in the streets he saw cars but he didn't know what to call him in other words he hadn't developed but there was a car in his in his uh mind he was seeing a vision of a car chariots jostling in the streets bumping into each other that's me and you going down the interstate right but he didn't know what to say or how to say it so listen it's kind of like me and you we don't know how to understand god how can you understand something that's eternal tell me how okay go back 10 billion b billion years you ain't even got started that's right right go 10 billion maybe million years that way you ain't now win so how are me and you and our finite we have a beginning and an end here on earth how are we going to understand this guy he's going to condescend or lower himself and bring you a revelation and then that's the first creation was god himself because i can't understand how a man can just be hanging out in the middle of in the middle of nothing that's what he was doing he was standing somewhere and he said let there be and boom i was thinking yesterday i was watching a video about trees they were like to amazon it's got oh billions of trees you don't know how many trees is in this world i'm talking about in the world god made every one of them god put the seed in the ground to make every one of them and he didn't bother him one bit he didn't have to get a calculator out so how you gonna understand that man you can't you can't understand how he was standing out in nothing a halo of light a little drama let's come let's see coming out of space where there's nothing let's make it a little white light like a mystic light now remember god never was a light he was a human or we would have been born a light all right i'm going to read genesis 1 26 we were born in the image of god made in his image okay so we were made in the image of a man but as i've always said if you and me would have been standing if we would have had moses as a buddy and we had the baptism of the holy ghost take me and and put me back in moses walking up through there and he's walking he's looking he sees a a bush that's burning and it's not being consumed and he hears a voice come out of the bush now see i'd know who it was you'd know who it was you know that was jesus christ standing in that in revelation moses revelation was god's up here god's a spirit great jehovah god i've heard him before maybe in his life but now i see him in this bush well see mine your revelation i believe i could see jesus standing there as a person because i've got the person inside of me well see that's the same way with god he's trying to reveal himself and look this is the only way he can reveal himself that you and me can understand it okay so let's see coming out of space where there's nothing make a little white light like a halo that was the logos that went out of god in the beginning that was the son of god the creator that came out of the bosom of the father that was what was in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and the beginning was god and then out of god came to logos a part of god that went out of god in other words god stepped over so that you can understand a little bit more right here then he stepped over a little bit more so you can understand him a little more right here he condescended down and all of a sudden for us to really be able to understand god he was born like me and you a baby i mean not not through sex you understand what i mean virgin born but still that baby had to come out a baby had to be born and that baby had to grow up that baby had to suffer he learned by the things he suffered all right and being made perfect he became the author of salvation all right so that part of god that went out of god now let's read genesis 1 26 so god said let us make man in our own image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and the fowl of the air and over every cattle and all the earth and every creeping thing that was upon the earth so god created man in his own image and the image god created in him male and female created him so he had a male and female he put him he put both in genesis 2 7 then he separated genesis 2 he separated genesis 1 26 over in another form called eve everybody with me when adam was first formed he was male and female eve was literally a part of adam and then what god took the rib he didn't have to take a rib but he took a rib he took a piece of adam and formed another body and then he separated that spirit that was both male and female and put this one brother brown said the feminist spirit went into eve and then he kept the masculine spirit that's why god said let us make man the image of god created to him male and female created he them so then he put them in flesh human flesh and he knew they were going to fall but he had to put him in human flesh he had to because he's a creator he did all that creating coming up pollywog frog cow horse monkey beast don't forget him god created him in creative evolution and then man amen they'll be okay with that that's what brother brown said he said we're just animal flesh now we can't procreate with the animal but we are animal flesh we're the flesh of animal all right we're just a higher form of an animal because we have a soul that's that genesis 1 26 man comes into adam and makes him a living soul all right so now let's fast forward through this genesis 3 15 that's when he talks about putting enmity we already read that genesis 3 22 he had to drive them out of the garden of eden he had to separate from them because he couldn't talk to him anymore the way they were the sinful condition they were in he couldn't talk to him anymore all right so he drove them out and he placed the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned everywhere but now look what is a sword a sword is the word he put a word there to keep him get back in it i don't think it would be you know no adam i got you nope you can't do that no it was a word he told him he said you can't get back in you can't get back in there you're done you're out you're out to keep the way of the tree of life because what's going to happen now brother brown said now that same sword or those same angels run you to the tree of life well what's running you to the tree of life an angel now the word the word's what's driving us back to our homeland the word is what's driving us to do the things that we do if you're christian amen and eve should have said like i said before being unto me according to thy word before that but it didn't happen she took the lie of the devil so now genesis 6 verse 5 i got to catch up here a little bit read some of this from last time saw the wickedness of man now this is before the flood it repented that he made them the lord said i'm going to destroy man that i've created from the face of the earth both male both man and beast and everything but remember noah found grace in the eyes of the lord amen he would destroy this earth if he didn't find grace in the earth today and call the bride of jesus christ because that's the only thing that's holding up this wrath amen is me and you okay so now let's go to luke 17 26 because it says as it was in the days of noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man now remember we were talking about that it says days of the son of man all right now watch they did eat drink married wives given in marriage until the day noah entered in the ark and then the flood came and destroyed them all all right now let's fast forward after the flood to genesis 18 1 and the lord appeared to who abraham the lord appeared to abraham in the plains of mamrie and he sat in the tent uh abraham this is abraham not abram he didn't meet him as abram but this is abraham and he lifted up his eyes and looked and three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bound himself to the ground and said my lord all right he had met this guy before so he knew who it was he said my lord and we know the meaning of that is adonai and which means of men or it's a spoken word spoken in place of yahweh in jewish display of reverence so he knew who he was brother brown said he knew that was elohim he knew that he and look he didn't even acknowledge the two that was beside him that's why i'm telling you there's going to be a separation time to where abraham focused on that one man the the son of man right he was focusing on him the other two we know that they went on to sodom but abraham never even acknowledged who they were because they were not to him they were to a different generation or they were to a different set of people and as they went to the world as billy graham and oral roberts and i know the bible says and brother branham says many times that they went down to blind the eyes of the sodomites or or blind the eyes of the world but listen there was people saved during that time because lot came out and his two daughters came out so they was people saved they didn't just go in there and blind them and smile and blind and they all went to hell no i believe under their ministry there was people that were saved they knew right from wrong they knew jesus christ died on the cross and he resurrected and came back into their heart son of god revelation amen because what stayed with abraham though the son of man stayed with abraham the two witnesses separated and took a message different from this message because this message was to save a group of people out of a city a sodom condition this one this one stayed for a body change this one stayed these two left there was no body change with these two it was destruction the whole world was destroyed or those two cities were destroyed and abraham stayed back or um melchizedek which would be you know jesus christ the theophany everybody got that he stayed back and he said abraham i'm going to visit you in a time of life i'm going to give you this you're going to have a child by sarah he told him everything he needed amen then i was listening the other day i don't it was one of the it was right after he preached marriage and divorce who is this melchizedek brother adam was standing and he had to divide the um he was preaching this way to the auditorium but he must have been standing in the middle of the basketball court with the the basketball goals on each end and they split it with a curtain and they split it where people would set all the way up here he said because there's audience on my left an audience to mariah well remember at the end of the service he turns his back and he said and in other words he's speaking he said and the lord told sarah the secrets of her heart in the tent behind her and he told the guy to stand up he said i can see a guy he said you stand up something about his daughter was sick well what he was doing he was showing the sign of the son of man he was showing us the same thing that you know that but see you got to keep it separate that wasn't jesus christ standing there william branham it was jesus christ using william branham using that trumpet to let us know because remember if the son of man's prophet prophetic then it's the word what's the old testament it's prophecy written in word but there's a revelation to that that we've got to catch amen so let's read genesis 18 verse 20 and the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous i will go down now and see whether they have done all together according to the cry of it now remember there's no record of him going down there he sends his two witnesses he sends his two minor prophets that's okay billy graham and oral roberts brother ram said and i will know and if not i will know and the men turned their faces from this and went toward sodom but look but abraham stood yet before the lord abraham was not going to let that man out of his sight he knew there was something coming from that man because that man had just told him that he's going to have a baby and he told what sarah said in the tent she giggled in her heart it's kind of strange that abraham got on the ground and laughed at god and god didn't do anything to him but sarah giggled in her heart and brother brown said god would have killed her if it hadn't been for abraham yeah and then then you take another prophet called abraham the same guy sent him down to wherever that was and the egyptian was going to marry her marry his wife and the holy ghost gives him a vision and says no you can't you don't need to do that he said and also by the way you need to go get abraham the one that lied to you that give that made this situation the way it is he give his life away you need to go call him to come pray for you that he'll restore the womb of the because they remember he closed all the wounds up they never had would never have a child after that kind of interesting how much he thought of abraham and that's kind of like me and you that's why the faith of abraham if we took abraham and took him from genesis 14 to genesis about 20 how he's the father of our faith sometimes you just don't know it he laughs at god gives his wife away he thinks he hears the right thing and takes hagar listens to his wife but you got to look at the revelation that he was strong in faith you know why because god said he was going to have it right here didn't matter about the journey he was looking at the promise he was looking right here got the birdie in the buddha i said i don't know how in the world i'm going to have that baby but this man said i was going to have it so that's it that settles it and then when he did like we did he kind of tries to jump in there and mess everything up all right so now let's go to genesis 19 and there came two angels to sodom and lots that in the gate we see what happened watch his revelation verse two says behold now my lords he sees both of them right he doesn't have a real revelation and we know what happened but now let's go to luke 17 verse 28 because likewise as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought the soul that planted the building just like noah but now remember in noah it says in the days of the son of man now watch what it says here but the same day that lot went out of sodom it ran fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed that's why brother brown goes to luke 17 28 to 30. he says that's the promise of the son of man being revealed and we'll get to that in just a minute with a quote that we got here and we'll read it real quick and then we'll be done so now moses comes on the scene and i'm going to read something this afternoon about moses and we'll we'll just save it for later and then remember what happened to joshua joshua 5 13. now what happens in joshua 5 13. i was thinking about the other day do you know that yeah going up to joshua that's good right there and it came to pass when joshua was by jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with a sword and drawn drawn in his hand he was a threat kids young adults god is not some 80 year old person 90 year old person sorry about y'all they're 80 or 90. sorry i'm not even going to look over that way god's not some 61 year old person either because he was so formidable that joshua pulled his sword he was so he was so in good shape he was so young he was a threat to joshua because joshua without a revelation at the moment went unto him and said are you for us are you against us and and god said nay no i i'm not no you don't understand you're fiction too but you don't understand at the moment nay but as captain of the host of the lord am i now come and joshua fell on his face of the earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my lord unto his servant the captain of the lord's host said unto joshua loose thy shoes from off thy feet i'll bet you well i don't say bad i'll guarantee you moses told joshua the story about the burning bush i'll promise you moses because remember he schooled joshua in all of his life trained him up to do everything right i'll i'll guarantee you he said when i was walking by that bush he said when god gave me this commission he told me to take my shoes off that i was standing on holy ground and when that happened right there joshua said my lord i he had he had two of and the captain of the lord's host senator joshua loose thy shoes from off thy feet for the place where on thou standest is holy and joshua did so i'll promise you joshua was a different man after he met that man he was a different guy but see that man was a formidable opponent he was not somebody that was like i've told you before when june was went to the baptist church and backslid a little bit and she uh got this little book that said experiencing god it looked like rip van winkle it was this old man wasn't jim this big picture of experiencing god and he has a staff in his hand and he's bent over like this he's looking at a beard down about right here long long gray hair remember in daniel 9 brother brown said he always wondered about that he said that's was not his hair when he talks about the white wig one he said that was a wig that he put on because the people in in um i think they still do it over in britain when they walk in that chamber they pull the it's a white wig he was a white wig one god's never had gray hair he's always been a young man amen why didn't mary think it was the gardener when he was standing in the garden he was he was the lord jesus changed back to a 20 year old man where have you took him but when she when he said mary she knew who he was amen so let's read this number four and number five and then we'll close while we'll get back to it this afternoon so now look the unveiling of god you ought to read that book notice now he came first as the prophet they crucified him his own crucified him he came as the son of man so the son of man is a prophet all right then after the holy spirit came he was then the son of god god is a spirit he was the holy spirit son of god he lived through the church ages as son of god in other words he was building his own body he took his body upon high standing on the right hand of the father stood there making intercession because that's what uh who was it stephen saw he saw jesus standing on the right hand of the father not standing on top of a right hand but in authority and power all right and after the holy ghost came he was then the son of god god is a spirit he was the holy spirit son of god he lived through the church age as the son of god like i said before just enough light to get them in the body of christ no seals no daniel 70 weeks no major doctrines paul didn't know a thing about a sale folks he died in 1856 and the seals didn't come out to ad-90 when john went over to patmos so he had already passed on but he spoke about him the whole time he just didn't know what to call them all right we know what to call them we can read the mystery of iniquity we can read those things and fit it in the seals because you know what god sent us a prophet now in the millennium he'll be son of david sitting upon the throne of his father david he is the son of david now he that's not now look he is the son of david comma he paused he said now to catch his next thought and remember between the son of god now see it was he always said son of man son of god son of david son of man son of god son of david everybody got that but remember between the son of god in the loudest in church age they put him out listen and excuse me in revelations 3 that's the son of man knocking trying to get back in that was a man standing there called jesus christ that's the son of man they had put that revelation out the door knock knock knock in the laodicean church age they put him out and in luke he said he would be revealed again as the son of man why did brother brown have to stand and he stood there in that coliseum and he said i indict this generation for the second crucifixion of the son of man in other words right god had to die in human flesh everybody understand that well they crucified him again and put him to an open shame that's why a prophet had to indict him that's why the son of man now has to be risen again from the dead dead denomination dead works all right look and he said he would be revealed again the son of man the prophet listen brother brown said the messenger of this whole church age was who the lord jesus christ amen christ came down in revelations 10. christ came down and sun's over on in wherever the mountain it was over there in arizona right brother brown didn't come christ came brother brown was already here brother brown said i was here when he was here i was just there when the picture was tough what a humble man knowing that though he was preaching that message of the son of man fulfilling the rest of it the scriptures tie perfectly together son of man son of god son of david what was it it's the same god all the time look just changing his form just like i said before in morphe you've changed his form to logos to word speech he comes down to where we can understand him he changed his form in morphe he just changed it's a great drama he is acting it out a great drama he's acting it out all right let's go to the next quote proving his word another good book you ought to read it too well i did bring it we'll talk about this a little bit this evening a little more in depth all right previous word after now after 1900 years with the church ages past where is he talking about us he's right here 2 000 years the church ages were 2 000 years ago a.d 30 to 2021 or somewhere around the time brother brown was talking here now watch all things that he prophesied of luther wesley we just went through and seen it drawn out and the moon came down and drawed it out and the lord drawed it on the board here for us and showed it now that's when he was preaching the church ages and come down himself and confirm confirmed it to be right after 1900 years and we're at the end of the loud to sin church age now when does the messenger come come on people the messenger comes at the end of the age not at the beginning he comes at the end of the age to bring his message all right he promised we're at the end of laodicean church age he promised in luke 17 30 that this same son of man he promised it would be revealed in the days like it was in sodom upon the earth did he do it does it have to come to pass it's impossible in other words it's impossible for it not to come to pass now remember he came in three names the son of man a prophet everybody got that all right stay with me just a minute y'all doing pretty good the son of god spirit that's the holy ghost everybody got that son of man was we saw him as hoffman painted him brother brown said that was close close as what he saw standing on earth in flesh that was the son of man and he prophesied he was a prophet and then when he left they killed him and he left he came back on the day of pentecost not with that same body again no no he was getting ready to build a body he was building a flesh body me and you amen so we're going to get to that that's going to be way over in this in the sermon where she is him amen she's not a part of she's not like him the devil is like him she is him we can't lose if we're him you cannot lose there's no way but our problem is we keep separating ourselves from him man has done it denomination well what happened on the mountain god said bring these people right here i'll talk to them the people come to the mountain they go nope don't want you to talk to us you got to talk through this man right here called moses and moses said i can't talk so god said don't worry you got a brother that can talk you tell him i'll tell you you tell him and him tell the people it's been that way ever since so it revealed in the last days does it have to come to pass now remember he come in three names the son of man a prophet the son of god the spirit so now he's working as the holy ghost his body is not on the earth we're his body can't have two bodies at the same time we're his body so we're here he's over in another dimension remember brother brown said i want to go see him he said you can't see he's in a higher dimension in other words he is now immortal these people you're seeing they're not immortal they got a body sitting back here on the earth jesus's body connected with him and he went and took it up in the seventh dimension that's where we're going to meet him at so now the son of david for the millennium but look but in between this conjunction roll it up so we all see it all the way on up now in between this conjunction so it's son of man son of god now we know son of david is to who the jews in the millennium he just said millennium for the millennium now is a millennium to me and you no it's not to the bride so what's he saying is he's saying that in between this conjunction now according to his own word and the day when the son of man shall be revealed now watch reveal himself as what not son of god will reveal himself in a different way god different no it's just more light it's just more revelation he will reveal himself though in a different way so listen that's why it's so important you stayed with the son of god revelation do you know we we make that quote i'll read the rest of this in a minute we make that or say the quote like on the on the questions and answers on the sales he said it's gone from you it's not for you right do you know what he was talking about he's telling them you're under the son of god revelation you're good christian people you love god you love the lord you le you know that jesus resurrected you know that he's in your heart listen brother brown could discern he knew that people had the holy ghost he knew who did and who didn't so he was saying go on as you are stay right there don't wind yourself away from it why because he knew they wasn't going to get to revelation in a different way because what is a revelation of the son of man the seals and he had just got preached to number six and they were asking about pantyhose should you wear pajamas at night he explained to father son holy ghost baptism for him for the hundred thousandth time preaching the greatest message they ever preached well see they were working under the son of god revelation they were working in that era that he said okay it's not for you it's coming in a different way and from 63 to 65 i believe that was the different way you and i got to catch that different way though to take a body change you can have the son of god and not take a body change but i don't believe you can have a full revelation of the son of man and miss the body change because he's the one that got changed he knows how to do it will reveal himself in a different way now what does that make malachi 4 exactly right see the son of man will reveal himself not in the whole big denomination of things that we've had through the ages but he would manifest himself as son of man again to make manifest malachi 4 and in that day i will send you elijah the prophet he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers away from all this denominationalism and come back to the original word again amen let me read this one real quick they don't have this one but watch this right here because listen there's always three classes of people that's what we'll be covering from now all the way through elijah in the meal offering 1960. we're living in the shadows of the end time there may not be a tomorrow night i don't know lord that's up to you it's a prayer he's praying but while it is yet possible that some could enter in tonight father i pray that you'll send the holy spirit you said as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man in the days of sodom they had three classes of the people the sinner the lukewarm church member and the elect that was who was there the center got destroyed right lot was the lukewarm church and the elect was abraham that's why brother brown said we have three classes of people in every congregation right believer mate believer and unbeliever right sodomites lodites and abraham called out of the world the sodomites received two ministers with a great message and abraham's group received a sign and the sign was a man with dust on his clothes who knew abraham being a stranger and knew his wife sarah what her name was and told abraham with his back turned to the tent where sarah was why did she laugh oh god may the church wake up and see as jesus said as it was the days of sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man that same god would appear now hold on a minute we're going to read something here it's going to shock you that same god would appear in flesh of his can church read that one more time oh god may the church wake up and see as jesus said as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man that same god would appear in the flesh of his church that's me and you and would show the same sign granted lord we ask in jesus name amen let's stand our feet musicians come he would appear in the flesh of his church and it was listen it's not a church it was his church amen but i like that quote there where he said he would reveal in a different way you brother wait are you saying i need another a different mindset yeah yeah you do i just read you what the quote said if he's going to reveal it to you in a different way then it's not the normal was jesus normal not to the people around him he wasn't normal now that doesn't make us crazy people not normal and we're not something different okay but jesus was considered a wine bibber a sinner the chiefest of sinners he hung around prostitutes and drunks all the time his disciples collectively except maybe matthew because he was a tax collector he had to know his numbers they couldn't got together and told you their abcs couldn't write their name right and that's what he used and we're looking for this and we're looking for this and we're looking for this he's in his church he's he's he's not coming back as the son of man he is here the son of man in his church but he's in his word first you gotta grab his word because that'll be in a different way and our thought process has got to be different move on up the statue of a perfect man move on up into the seals and the different things that were required listen it's a requirement i didn't make it god did but you know what to make a requirement brother brown said he had to make a way so who stops the way me and you we stopped the way to get there amen so let's open that thing up like i said first of the year whatever you got inside of you let it out if it's wrong but you need to let it out if it's god i'd like to see it amen i would i'd like to see it if it's god i want to see it if it's the devil i like to see it because we know when he gets out he's going to leave because we want him to be uncomfortable let's sing a song if you have a need oh yes oh yes i love this song [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] amen amen let him show it let him show it [Music] start acting like the child of a king [Music] can [Music] [Applause] no yes [Music] is [Music] praise [Music] amen if you're a child of the king you get what the king gets you get what the king gets i'm a child of the king he came and died the only the only king that i know that ever died to save the world but he could do it because he could come back inside of us not everybody else can do that just the lord jesus could do that but the son of man we're going to get into him a lot more because there's a lot of little intricacies that we need to talk about for the son of man in a different way now listen you're not going to hear it no different what brother they'll preach then so don't think we're getting something that we found a new book or a new tape or we've talked to this new preacher nope you're going to hear the same thing but you know what i'm praying that it'll be given in a light and a light that will help you and they'll give us revelation to get out of here because it will have to be revealed in a different way you think about brother brown from that 1963 to 1965 he preached to people in a trailer and had 30 people in the trailer and it was an old run down trailer somewhere out in arizona 30 people and he used to preach to 30 000. 30. and when he was coming back from from texas and he was going to jeffersonville he was going to preach on the trail the serpent and he said they'd they'd be more than that going to be leaving him so he would have literally stood alone by itself just like the lord jesus did and that's the same way with you and i money women in popularity i don't ever want to be popular i want to be well known but i don't ever want to be popular because popularity would go to your head hey man and the money and the way i'm money i'll never have them women i got one that's enough hey man hey man 42 years what are you laughing so much for esther sister bless your heart you didn't laugh that much and we had a good time yesterday at the yard sales and it was fun we appreciate all your sisters some of your sisters coming so thank you for that but uh god bless you love you with the love of the lord let's bow our heads the heavenly father we thank you lord for this day that you give us we appreciate lord the people that you give us to speak to they're the salt of the earth lord i pray they become saltier and that will draw people closer to you lord even by testimony and the worship and the different things that we do father i pray that you'll anoint us this day forward to a higher level that we'll know what we're talking about when we preach that we know what we're talking about when we sing we know what we talk about and who we're talking about when we worship you father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes lord being weak in the body lord we know that things get on each one of us and we pray that you would just continue to push those things out of the way lord that we can see you father the author and finisher of our faith father just be with each one that's sick that's not here in the building the ones on the internet lord couldn't make it we pray that you just bless them father just take care of each and every one of us until we come back lord this afternoon in service for you in jesus name we pray amen you're dismissed i'm a brand new man i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man
