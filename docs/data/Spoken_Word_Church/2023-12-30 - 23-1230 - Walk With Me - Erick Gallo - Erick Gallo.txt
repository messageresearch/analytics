they all send greetings to each one of you they knew that we were going to be here with you all tonight before we go to the word I wanted to give an invitation a formal invitation on behalf of myself as well as my church to brother Dale so that he could come and visit us and that he could come be with us maybe this coming [Laughter] year the doors will be open let's go to the scriptures tonight we're not going to take too much time but I want to go to the Book of Genesis chapter 5 verse 21 a scripture that's very well known to us Genesis 5:21 and if you have it say Amen the word of God says and Enoch lived 6 and5 years and beget Methuselah and Enoch walked with God and he begat Methuselah 300 years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were 36 and5 years and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him now in the Book of Joshua chapter 6 verse one 61 61 okay Joshua 61 now Jericho was straightly shut up because of of the children of Israel none went out and none came in and the Lord said unto Joshua see I have given into thine hand Jericho and the King thereof and the Mighty Man of Valor and ye shall Compass the city all ye man of war and go round about the city once thus shalt thou do six days and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams horns and the seventh day you shall Compass the city seven times and the priest shall blow with the trumpets [Music] and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with the Ram's Horn and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall Shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall Ascend up every man straight before him let our heads Lord Jesus you know the need of every heart here tonight you know what every person here father is going [Music] through and you also know what every person needs and so father we ask you tonight that you would just come down and take every request every petition and that you would would just bless those each one of those requests Lord we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen you may be seated for a moment and I trust that with that we be able to enjoy the word we want to we want to talk a little bit about our walk with God we were called for to walk with God we were called to walk in this way we were called to walk in a certain path and that path is the narrow way so when you hear the a narrow way that lets you know that it's not an easy path we know that it has not been easy to come to the place where we are at this moment and I'm not talking about just coming to church because coming to church it was easy because you have the heat on and and you have maybe heated seats or whatever but it's not the same thing coming to church the uh uh uh it's not the same thing coming to church then compared to coming to the word it's different you can come to church all every day and maybe we might forget that every time that we've come to church but we come to the word one time I don't think we forgotten that experience that we had when we came to the word I can't forget the time when I came to the word let me tell you I was born in this message I I was born in this faith when my when my when I was when my parents gave birth to me they they already knew the message but it's one thing to be in the message another thing is for the message to be inside of you and that's the difference in the time that we are living in we have people that come to the message but we need that that message get inside of them we have people that carry the message people that go to church and they carry the Bible and when we were traveling when we on in the car while ago and going through these [Music] cities I saw many churches around the the the the the [Applause] cities and I imagine that many people are going to go to church here in this New Year's time but it's not the same thing to carry the Bible but that the Bibles be inside of you we are in the correct way you don't have to be doubting that this is the right way there are people that are leaving this way remember the vision that brother brandham had those those women they were walking there on in that line but when that Vision was about to close there were some that were moving from side to side and they were getting out of step and let me tell you tonight it's not easy to stay in the way but there is only one way I've read about many men throughout the history very great philosophers great men but I only know one they had the sufficient Valor to say that I am the way the truth and the life and I'm very happy tonight to tell you that I serve The God Who said I am the way the truth and the life hallelujah hallelujah glory to God blessed be his name feel happy tonight that you are serving a living God you're not serving a God that doesn't move in Honduras we have a lot of paganism the people go and they and they they bow down to little statues last month in my city they had a little celebration and they have a a holy Patron and his name is San Diego and he can't move but the people ask of him Miracles and they and they take out their money and they give it to San Diego and they tell him they ask him San Diego please help me to get some work and San Diego please help me that that so that I can be healed but San Diego can't even move San Diego ever since I've known him since I was a little kid he's in this position the whole [Applause] time when San Diego gets dirty somebody has to wipe his face he can't even clean his own face but for you it's funny but those people have faith in San Diego you know why that's funny to you because you know that that's false and you know why that's funny to you because you know a God that does move because you know a God that can answer so for God to answer you need to speak to him in faith if you have faith tonight don't worry you you'll leave this place differently all you had to do is bring a bit of faith because the word of God is here the holy spirit is here when the Holy Spirit connects with faith and when that Faith takes us to the word the Bible say ask and it shall be given to you hallelujah hallelujah can you give him a clap of Praise hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah we serve a God that's alive Liv but you need to call him by faith hallelujah hallelujah you know faith is compared to one of our our our senses you know that we have five senses with one we can [Music] see I can see that my wife is back there and my faith tells me my sight tells me she's the most beautiful that's in here yeah amen [Laughter] [Applause] right someone said someone said no because that's not your [Laughter] wife glory to God but you see that's what our fa our our eyesight is declaring but there is another sense that declares taste none of you can tell me how this water tastes like only my taste buds are able to to to know you can't tell me how it smells like either I can tell brother Aaron that water smells like strawberries and I can tell him well I don't smell that or you can tell me I don't smell that but my my sense of smell declares that we have five senses church but let me tell you something these five senses can fail you amen sometimes you can see things that seem like they're right or they're true but they're not true you can smell something right and your sense of smell could fail you you could hear something and you can say tell me again because I heard it wrong that shows that your five senses but when God made his bride when God made his elective he gave a six sense to you and me you know when my when my when my eyes sight fails my six sense cannot fail because my sick sense can only rest in one place it can only rest in this word amen when I have that six sense placed on this it doesn't matter what comes to my ear the doctor May tell me I cannot get healed it doesn't matter to me I can see that maybe I'm not getting better but that doesn't matter either I can feel that in my body I'm not getting better but that doesn't matter either because we have a six sense and my has always points me back to what he's done for me Brethren the doctors can do their job but when they're done with what they know what to do then we have a better place to go to there is you don't have to get depressed there's been thousands of years that have gone by but the word continues to say by his stripes I've been healed amenu Hallelujah that's what faith does now you might tell me brother I I've gone to church and I haven't felt one thing the only thing I feel is sleepy I go to church because my parents parents take me to church I go to church because if not my dad will get upset but if it was up to me I would be at at the house watching Instagram or Facebook or Facebook or Twitter or Twitter to see which one is the mo you know the modern uh singer of the day to see what Netflix is showing right but my parents bring me here and I don't feel anything at church I don't blame anyone that feels that way no [Applause] no I believe that those people they say if I could just feel God just a little bit I would be different but let me tell you God is here today you might say that man's crazy the people in Honduras they're crazy is there any other Crazy Ones here there it's a it's a it's a crazy house here Welcome to the hous spoken word because we have crazy people here there in heaven there's a there's a bigger crazy house there and they're crazy like us they're they're there and they're waiting for us Paul said by the the craziness of preaching the foolishness and it was that's how it pleased him to save the world you know why you don't feel it because you haven't received it brother Brandon was a young man I'm not taking too much time I don't see you sleeping yet so we're still good the first time the the sign will be the first when the first one does that and you're going to I'm going to be thinking that what you want me to do is get down to stop are we okay all right brother Brandon was a young man and he preached in the uh in the Parks and he was a young man preaching in the [Music] parks there was an older gentleman that came to him [Applause] and he asked brother Bram he said uh you get you uh you need to prove to me about that God that you're preaching about prove to me that he's real if you prove to me that he's real then I'll believe the way you believe and brother Brandon being a young man he said to him I believe it because it's written in the word so the man told him he said that's not sufficient for me show it to me that he's real and brother Brandon felt like he was defeated he did not know how to respond to this man but the Bible says that if you stand for God God will stand for you and at that moment the Holy Spirit came down and he stood next to the prophet and when that the older gentleman decided to walk away and leave with Victory he felt like he had victory over brother brandom the Holy Spirit told him uh tell him to to St to stand still and the Holy Spirit spoke to through brother brandom through his prophet and I believe brother brandham he died but the Holy Spirit doesn't die amen God still has vessels and if God stood for his Prophet God will stand for his bride in this time amen and he told him he said tell him to to hold on brother random told him to stop he said I'm going to show him how to receive God and he had a little a little U like a little pin or something right here and brother brandham took it and he was a he was a a great a big man a strong man maybe he was dressed in red [Laughter] and he stood there brother Brandon we know he was a small man he took that little needle that there was there was on him that little pen and he told him he took that little the little needle from the pen and he started poking him and he asked him he said do you feel that and the man said of course of course I feel that said do you feel this of course I feel that and brother Brandon said I don't feel it do you feel it brother but I don't feel [Laughter] it let's let's let's keep going with the drama he said I don't feel it that do you feel it brother do you feel it brother do you feel it do you feel it sister do you feel it that man told him you Christians you you all are crazy how can you feel that because I'm the one who's who's being txed by that pen and brother Bram told him that's what I want to tell you if you want to feel it you have to receive it if you want if you want healing you have to receive it if you want to feel the Holy Spirit you have to receive the holy spirit because the world can say I don't feel it but I do feel it tonight I have felt it all throughout this year I feel that he's helped me yesterday I felt that he that that he's helped me today and if there's a tomorrow in the 2024 he will continue to help me because I know that he's the same yesterday today and forever glory to God hallelujah that's what faith does so we're on a [Applause] [Music] walk just as Joshua was in a walk they they were told to go and possess the the the land that land was a was a promise to them how many believe that nobody could stop that they get to that Land There was the one that was that was the the the Red Sea the red the Red Sea I I didn't hear what he had said so I heard something red [Laughter] and and I ask you tonight did the Red Sea stop them no no the the the there were bitter Waters did the bitter Waters stop them they were in the desert did the desert stop them why did none of those things stop them it was because they were predestined to get to that land they were elected to come to to get to that [Applause] land now I want to ask you tonight with faith in your heart do you believe that God chose you amen now let me tell you God doesn't make mistakes he right if God chose you God is not practicing on you or he's not learning he knows what he has done the pastor couldn't couldn't bring them I'm sorry the pastor couldn't bring you the a brother couldn't bring you in it had to be God drawing [Applause] you and don't forget that in your heart when when the Devil comes in and then throws those things in your mind you can say Satan I've been brought here by the Holy Spirit I've been elected by the Holy Spirit that's what makes the difference if man brought you here the man can take you out of the way but if God brought you in this way there is nothing or nothing nobody that can take you out of this way there is no trial that can take you out of this way there is no sickness that can take you out this way because God is not learning the prophet said God doesn't save you today to lose you tomorrow God didn't save you on the cross of calary to lose you here in 2023 if God saved you he did it today and he did it forever for eternity you're saved by grace you're not saved by the things you do you're saved for what he did for you on Calvary glory to God nothing could detain the the children of Israel nothing could stop them now they're a shadow of of us now we're in this way and you're in this way you can only Advance or only move backwards you can't stay still that's right brother amen this year that's leaving us is 2023 you're either ahead or what were or what you were in 2022 or you're just going backwards more and you can only do those two things you're either advance in in this walk or you're either going backwards and even in simple things like this service you shouldn't you're not going to leave here different I'm sorry you're not going to leave here the same you're either going to leave here better or you're going to leave worse it's your decision it's your choice amen what I want us to see before we finish that the same thing the same way that nothing stopped the children of Israel from getting to the promised land there is nothing that can stop you to come to your maximum promise we have promises Divine Healing is a promise of God forgiveness of sins is a promise for us the revelation of all the word it's a promise for us it's not for the denomination it's for all of us the book has been open the Mysteries have been revealed to bring us to the maximum promise that we have we have gifts that have been promised in the word and the gifts are fine speaking in tongues is good Divine Healing is good but the maximum promise has been given to his bride only to his bride has been promised to her that these bodies will be changed glory to God I've never heard nothing greater than that my body will be changed one of these days the wrinkles will go away the white hair will go away the back pain will be no more in a twinkling and open up an ey the dead in Christ shall rise first and those who remain we receive the most glorious thing of all the ages to receive him in the air you know what's the most glorious thing that there is a name that you have a name today and your name is Lord Jesus Christ that's the most glorious thing that exists and it's promised for you and me Jesus Christ reigning with his bride together amen where did we go earlier we went to the future but now we're we're we're walking presently I don't see that nothing's happening yeah come on Amen Joshua gather the people gather the priest [Music] they take they take the trumpets and start marching and they marched the first day and nothing happened they asked the people did you see that the walls did they shake when they when they blew the trumpet no we didn't hear anything we didn't see anything well let's do it the next day let's take the trumpet the next day something's going to happen on the second day and they prepared themselves and they took the trumpets and they dressed right they took the the Arc of the Covenant and they started to March and when it was noon they were sweating and the sun got strong and when they went to put up their horns did something happen today no nope did the wall Shake no no did something strange happen in in in the service nothing happened everything was the same what did you do all we did was walk glory to God that we're walking [Applause] so they on the third day they prepared the trumpets just the same and the same thing happened maybe someone said we're just wasting our time let's just take this Joshua out and and let's let's let's make a a weapons and let's push the walls of Jericho down maybe let's find ropes and let's let's climb up Jericho walls but God had told him not that you were going to walk up or climb up Jericho but you were going to walk through Jero the word of God has to fulfill be fulfilled and when the fifth day came the fifth uh uh uh priest got uh got ready and he started to uh to to prepare his horn and he started to blow his horn and the walk started again and the trumpet was sounding the just shall live by faith but nothing happened the sixth day came and the six Trumpeter he prepared his horn and the sound was even louder than the previous Trumpeter without holiness no one will see the lord and there inside of Jericho walls there was a lady there and she's hearing the sound of every trumpet and as the trumpet was sounding She Was preparing herself do you know who I'm talking about I'm talking about Rahab R have had a sign that was placed on her house R have had received a message and now the sound of the trumpet with the sound of the trumpet She Was preparing herself and let me tell you tonight the trumpet is sounding and we are walking in the right way glory to God [Applause] it seems like nothing is happening we go to church did something happen no nothing it's the same message brother Aon preached I slept a little bit nothing happened and we come back to church like as if nothing or we leave church like nothing but something is happening something is changing every day that H that that takes that goes by there's a someone's taking an extra step another step ahead as that as that that colored lady said I'm not what I'd like to be I'm not what I should be but one thing I know I'm not what I used to be what is that it's because we're walking on a [Applause] journey and when the sixth day came I love this because really the sound of the trumpet was not what made the wall fall come on brother the prophet said that when the people shouted remember the trumpet sounded but the people also shouted as well and I believe that the trumpet sounded the seventh Trumpeter sounded the trumpet but now we have taken the book so that it be John who prophesies again it's time for the people to shout but in the middle of the shouting of the people the prophet says that the shout of the King was in the middle of the campu Hallelujah and do you do you see what we believe do you see what we have received it's time that you take the message that you take the word and stand for what that word says because the Shad of the king is in the middle of the camp amen it's not just me and brother Luis preaching here but it's his voice speaking to you telling you to keep moving on do not give up it seems like nothing's happening the devil will tell you nothing's happening you're wasting your time you tell the devil on his face and you tell him I'm wasting I'm advancing he said it and he will it somebody can believe that give a give a clap praise to the Lord s to your feet amen heavenly father thank you tonight we thank you Lord that you've given us this time Lord we thank you for every believer Lord that we are able to know that we are able to understand why we were brought here and Lord we know in our hearts that is not a waste of time we have walked for many years and we could just say here eer the Lord has helped us and know that you will help us the rest of the way there can be sick ones amongst us but you would give us strength to believe you more daily Lord we ask this as we ask you Lord for this congregation for the body of ministers here Lord so that you help them and that you give them strength so

want to thank you all for the prayers that you made for my son there is a very precious testimony that I'd like to share with you all and if I have time to do it tomorrow I'd like for you all to

there belonged to Israel and they possess that land we have a promise that we've been predestinated to no one and nothing can will be able to stop us do you believe that God bless you all tonight amen

I'm talking about God amen amen amen everybody in the city died except for Rahab and her family right you know all those men that she had been with they were dead Jesus stood one day and had a prostitute standing in front of him and there was some accusers there right by the word he got rid of those accusers all of Jericho could have accused Rahab of being a prostitute but God stood one day
