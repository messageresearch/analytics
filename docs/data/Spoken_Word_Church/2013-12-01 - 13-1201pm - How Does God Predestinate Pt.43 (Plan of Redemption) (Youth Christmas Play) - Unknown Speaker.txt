TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hundred years before our lord jesus was born the prophet isaiah said therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold avoi a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel this was fulfilled through the faith of a message believer named mary when the angel gabriel was sent from god and said hail thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and behold thou shalt conceive in thy room and bring forth the son and shalt call his name jesus and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her and the word was made flesh among us full of grace and truth mary did you know that your would save our sons and daughters did you know that your baby boy has come to make you new never did you know that your baby boy did you know that your baby boy you kiss the face of god um again is is did you know that your baby boy is is open the i want to see pour out your power and

reading the announcement going down the steps as to uh what to bring and what to do for the uh thanksgiving and christmas together so we decided to have them both this time and just have it earlier or it would work out a little better you know in in our doing so just remember that all right any other announcements i've generally missed something you know ain't nothing else okay all right romans 8 and ephesians 1. heavenly father we thank you for all the things that you've given unto us we thank you for these children lord because they truly are an example to each and every one of us that in their young life that they've come to church we know we come with mom and daddy but still they come and they participate lord they sing and they worship and we have the the children's time there on the during the month about the third sunday lord and we let the kids sing and worship and conduct all the services what we want them to do and have a part we want them to have a part with this is their church not to just say this is somebody else's church but it's theirs we pray that you would just bless and guide each one and father remember wade preaching for brother ultic today and remember brother dean there down at his brothers preaching just bless these on traveling home be with sister give me lord and touch your father and deliver just you said you sent your word and healed us so we believe it so we can depend upon that that's a promise that we can take home with us lord and and believe it we love you and we thank you have your way now keep us in jesus name amen all right romans 8 28 for we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are thee called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate what to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called he them he also justified in them and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us how can we fail it's impossible for a christian to fail we're going to be there and it'll be right okay ephesians 1 starting with verse 7 in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory he first trusted in christ in whom he also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that now notice it says with that why didn't it say with thee it's emphasizing it see with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance what until the redemption of the purchase possession unto the praise of his glory you may be seated the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now what i want to do this afternoon is is just they don't have not one you won't be reading not one quote so that's pretty good i told them they're gonna give them vacation they don't have to fight in there and try to get everything to go and i ain't saying i won't quote a lot i'm saying i won't give we won't have but one quote i mean but one reading up there and that was the reading of the scriptures because what i want to do is just kind of go back and review down to where we are maybe make a little uh speaking of you know uh future things but not much on that because then we will start the lord willing the next service and we'll start in because i want to go from here from before the foundation world down to jesus christ especially make a few more comments but yet mainly stop there and and see about this because we're going to call it the plan of redemption you know we're still dealing with how does god predestinate this is message 43 on it but we're going to talk about the plan of redemption revealed now to remember what we were talking about this morning if something is not revealed it's still just letters on a page all right even though we can quote it by memory i remember brother moat and them brother george and him years ago um they uh was talking to a man that they you know they got into the one god doctrine and this man came that was a trinitarian well he he wanted he wanted to talk to them well he could quote the bible totally by memory you know i mean he was a smart man and i appreciate that that was that was good but yet he was a trinitarian and uh but see this the simplicity of of asking him a few questions once he got into the discussion as i said until the man wound up to him they would say what is his name and he'd say rosa sharon you know he's he's passing it off they said no no call his name because they were showing him water baptism see in the name of the lord jesus christ and they were dealing with you know the name there in matthew 28 and he said the man never would call the name jesus because he said because see if he'd called it then they had him where they wanted to talk to him and and they were in no capability in the category he was in as far as intellectual understanding but yet they had asked some simple questions that he couldn't answer right you see if you have a revelation you don't have to worry right i don't i don't have no fear about what's been revealed to me and you asked me a question about something not been real i'll just tell you and i don't have any problem saying i don't know that's no problem just say i don't know i have questions about the bible and why it would state certain ways and do but i know and realize that's my problem it's not god's problem because he said it right well i just have to keep waiting until he'll come on the scene somewhere and put it together and he may use a little somebody you know i told you about sister birds that time when she said well he was god all the time and i said well i wish i'd let you preach because i spent an hour and a half trying to prove he was god and she said he was just god all the time well that was just an uneducated person but yet speaking by revelation all right and see if something's revealed it's good we're listening last night i'm pretty sure that one brother random was talking about said you can know the letter of the word you know you you can memorize it you can know the letter of it but he said if it's not revealed see then then what is it it's laying there waiting for the revelation it's wonderful to study and pray and seek god but to uh remember brother tom talking about a man that was trying to memorize the bible and he would run a bulldozer he said he would read a scripture get off and go do something but he's quoting that scripture all the time he's gone just trying to memorize it well i'm honest and i'm sorry i've never tried to memorize the bible if you had to depend on me to quote the lord's prayer i would probably quote it wrong because there is like two or three ways to say some things you know in one place that'll be one group will be in and but i've never tried to memorize the bible i just read it and and i depend upon him to speak to me to reveal it to me because it's not how much i know it's who i know all right see then in revelation we were talking about this morning that's the greatest thing we need a revelation more than anything because by revelation the gates of hell cannot prevail against us all right and you say well boy bless god ain't prevailing it's me well you're still living no death is still taking you and everything lord we just you know i heard out there today that brother uh everybody even announcing doors to tidwell and just passed away this past week i didn't know that but see the people are just gradually dying off but why because we're getting older and you know time lies and you're not going to die off so and the ones that are looking at and saying i'll never die you're going to be as old as we are and it's a lot of fun all right but now listen we started out we we took the plan of salvation or the plan of redemption talking about how does god predestinate we went back before the foundation of the world because that's the only way you can do with it we went back there and we spent quite a while talking about how does god predestinate the prophet said he predestinates by for knowledge all right so which comes first predestination or foreknowledge if your predestination comes first what do you need for knowledge right you're wasting your time but if you've got four knowledge then you can predestinate what the destiny will be all right and we found that god does not predestinate by his own desires because he desired that everybody be saved all right then desiring everybody to be saved he can't make us lost then condemn us for being lost right but he knew when he made us that if he gave us free moral agency that we would fall all right now most of these things you know that have listened to the series i'm actually quoting service after service and these are quotes from brother ranum so if you need something call me i'll be glad to let you know where it's at all right then he couldn't make us lost and be just and condemn us but by knowing what we would do so we knew jacob would be what he would be he knew that a saul would be what he would be so he could say before they were either one born jacob he loved and he saw he hated all right before they were ever born now but you remember one thing i like it this way you know had he not given esau an opportunity see then look where he would be so we can't just say well he just predetermined it no he looked down and saw what they would do their desires and their things and yet he deals with people like we went through the series of studying on how that he even dealt with cain and said cain would you not been received the prophet said he would have been received had he not turned against him all right so then we got to look at predestination as a destiny set yeah but to look and see that it's by for knowledge because that way then we don't have to worry about it that way it's not say well you know i i i just i don't know i was talking to somebody the other day and they said just talking to a person without living in the world and said but if i'm predestinated i'll be there now that's what we think that's a good old baptist you know one of these days something will happen and i'll get saved well now i don't look at it that way i believe our lives are supposed to prove what we are right the way we live shows whether or not we're predestinated right brother tom farbush had a good west daily he said you trigger your predestination see then you've got all the way through the scripture like you know what the uh heart man believeth unto righteousness with the mouth confessions made under salvation well what if you've never done that it's in the word if we'd never done it look where we'd be but then we were talking about that then we came down to the garden and we won't spend that much time in the dealings and we won't go through the the part in the garden other than one thing god knew if he put us here we would go wrong all right knowing that then as quick as man went wrong you know adam and eve in the garden then he immediately made the atonement by killing the animals and putting the skin on them all right showing that what he was going to do he wasn't going to throw him away had he just went on and killed it look what it would have been even somebody we were talking outside one day made a good point or somebody was talking to me recently the if he had allowed adam to have killed cain that would have ended all knowledge of the beast and all of the things so he didn't even allow that he actually took care of him to make sure that everything would work out because it's got to be here all right but when it come into mankind then we see that he not only had a plan his plan and purpose was not only to just cover the sins you know with the atonement but that he was come immediately and say and i'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman promising the coming messiah to redeem not to just atone a tone is great wonderful thing yet all the way down to that old testament that atonement would just cover but it could not be redeemed but we want to see down to there that redemption was spoke of all right supplying the atonement covered to sin but the promise of the redeemer would be greater all right then that's remember we went through it we're talking about it we're brought around and said that god told adam going out of the garden the love of god for mankind because adam was going out of the garden he said but i'll put enmity between that he promised to see to the woman all right and when he did he said i'll go with you now that may not mean anything to you but it means a whole lot to me when he would say i'll go with you i'll not leave you and when i read that one day of the prophet he said that god just came down and busied himself with the children of israel even though they were constantly doing wrong and i showed you time after time the bible said they sinned 10 times between leaving egypt and cadence barney never did god say i'm not going to let you go but when they come to cadiz barnea and rejected the fact that god could do it he said you're not going see that becomes sin which is unbelief because we know that's what happened with eve in the garden right eve disbelieved god brother brown said even the fact that she doubted hebrews 13 8. that he's the same yesterday today and forever but see then by god saying what he said he had to make a way to redeem now had he i'm just plainly saying it and he stayed in the garden it wouldn't work so he came out to go with mankind and prepare away all right now what i want us to look at is that we talk about that seed of the woman the promise of the coming messiah okay a redeemer to redeem mankind during the time of the atonement in the old testament what they would do could only speak of top it shadow it that would not come forth as the redeemer you know into full being all right they would only speak of it every time they take an animal up and kill it it would speak of the coming of messiah okay now but in doing that we can follow that throughout the scriptures the promised messiah the redeemer that was promised the seed of the woman that was promised all right we see in noah now let's just take a run through the bible just real quick we see in noah was a promise of an ark to come and carry the people over the flood a redeemer if you might say right a perpetuation made that's more than just offering an offering a way would be made to save mankind if you just get in the ark all right and he was given free moral agency right and they decided to get in the ark look what it would have been but now god didn't somebody asked me the other day how big the ark would i never have figured that out feet i don't know i just say it's a couple of football fields along with half of one wide or something i don't really know but you know what if it was a world like today then there's about 7 billion people in the world today suppose that world was to that degree and what about eight people is all seven really beside him believing his own message but see i believe god could have built a ship big enough to cure everybody right mean it wouldn't matter how long it had to be or how big it had to be you said well i don't know well they had 120 years to build it i mean i i i i've done a little carton of work but i have back there it's grinning because he has and he'd say well i started on a house well how long you been 120 years you're a slow carpenter you know i mean brother daniel he just he built one about a year ago or something well you just don't spend 20 years building on a house now unless you live in jamaica we laughed in jamaica because right next to brother reed for years of us going over there you'd look at it and it was just a foundation you go back to the years and there might be walls up and then finally they'd be up and then finally they got a roof on the thing but they were doing it according to they could afford it but you know they did get a roof on it they didn't get a house done but see 120 years noah could have built an ark big enough to carry the whole world if the whole world was going to go all right now my point is what about god's foreknowledge he knew now i'm going to try to approach this in the best way that i can he knew that it was only going to be noah his wife three kids and their wives there's no list of grandkids there's just eight souls right now he knew that now i'm honest i've always liked to look at things realistically 120 years of knowing preaching you said we only got seven converts well you know there might have been some people that in the beginning that believe noah you don't ever think you know just be sensible there might have been some people that believed it you know what they died before the ark came right because you've got different ones names in there and you've got all of those people coming down from adam down to noah anybody been a lot of people they never believed that brother gary and they said we're looking forward to it they might have been people donated money we'll say it today to help noah all right he said well why would you say it like that because that's what i said 40 some years ago and you know it i said the biggest portion of the people of this message are going to die and go by the grave i said that 40 years ago no he backed up yet he's ah that's just time running out well okay it's just time running out all right it was just something i said but it's true it's not just the old people dying that are following this message a lot of young people die too i'm not going to call them unbelievers what about you well they didn't believe because they died jesus died brother branham died paul died peter died come on get it off you little thoughts of what you think is right and just listen there might have been a lot of people believe noah but they all went by the grave they were left with a little group of people you know why did i believe that because there's going to be a little group of people that's going to walk off this earth that's the end of the message it's going to walk off this earth in a rapture and i'm not going to say all this died before then didn't believe the message i'm just going to say they couldn't make it and if i'm one of them it don't bother me if he's right on my tombstone he didn't make it you know that'll bother me that don't mean i'm not a believer that means time run out with me all right and see that's just the way i think i i don't want to throw nobody just out and just forget it you know but you see noah he come along with a promise he rose up went over come back down but it was a type the ark of christ right right the promise of the messiah you know what he was in that day are you listening yes he was the messiah right the anointed one not the christ that would finally come but he was christ the anointed one all right you jump over to abraham abraham gets a promise he was promised to see to the woman he lived his life and followed as much as he could changed his name all kinds of things happened to him even got a change of the body right which is a type right to you and i right you see he had to promise trying to fulfill of the coming of the messiah for that time are you following me you know one day he did have that child that promise that was there and that promised son was isaac but he only typed the coming of the promised seed but yet he was the top of it so there was a redeemer but not being not being in the completeness he would be a type a shadow something i would jump over to moses moses said brother brown said could even therefore it come to the bases that it was god was fixing to destroy the children of israel and moses rose up and said god if you kill them said you got to come over me in other words you've got to kill me first and brother brown said he was the type of christ he was actually god to the people you remember that aaron was his prophet the bible didn't have any trouble calling him god or saying what he was well why can't we well see he was speaking of the coming messiah and what about a man stand between god and the people now you got many times in there when that would happen i remember one incidence remember and the plague was coming down because of the israelites doing wrong and moses hollered to air and said aaron take the sensor you know go get some cold off the fire and go among the people and make an atonement well you know what that done that spirit israel that redeemed in the basis of stopping the death from coming so noah moses abraham type in christ would be a type of the redeemer or be a type of the seed of the woman which would be christ to come forth what about david what about david being able to kill a lion a bear and a giant all right the line of the buyer was to keep them from eating up his daddy's sheep which we find a tight will but when he killed that giant he was actually the savior of israel right in top he was a redeemer in top he was the seat of the woman there was promise to come if you understand what i'm saying when each one of these come forth and as they manifest the god of their time and their age wherever they would actually be then the coming forth of the seed of the woman does that give any trouble to preach where i did one day it comes down to you and i in this last days that we've got to give birth to jesus christ that's right that shouldn't be any problem when you can look back there and see what they've done what about the judges of israel you know what about samson gave his heart to delilah and gave his body to god you know god used him to redeem israel yes man right think of those things what about gideon man of valor the bible called him yet god used him those judges judged israel but those judges were the redeemers of israel right the protector the the the uh one that would save them from being destroyed even though they would be judged a lot of time and and put into great imprisonments and things but yet he would still speak of like when jeremiah said they were going down there you're going down you're going to ground he said but you're coming back in 40 years all right the prophet daniel got down there and he got to looking around and he said by books we're supposed to get out of here by promise that god had made a redeemer would be supplied to come forth what about getting even closer as to the book of ruth where the in the book of ruth you have ruth and boaz and naomi and all of the things the boys wound up being a type of christ ruth is the top of the bride naomi is the type of israel but they would be a redeemer to carry on the lineage of israel are you following me yes all right what about then getting into the many prophecies then we spent a lot of time talking of genesis there were said i'll put enmity between thy seed the seed of the woman a promise but what about isaiah getting so caught up in the spirit until he would say a virgin shall conceive right the seat of the woman was getting closer and closer david brought it to a great thing when he would say they pierced my hands and my feet speaking of the first person isaiah comes down to a directly written word prophecy it's like genesis was a word prophecy you know written in the word not just typing it but actually prophesying of what it would be go through the book of isaiah sometimes when you get a change and look at all the things that he said wrote a complete bible showing it all the way to the future home a prophecy amen then that way looking at the bible and you find the bible the biggest portion of it is prophecy right speaking of the future all right the promise of the coming of the messiah whereas the atonement could just cover sin they couldn't eradicate it now listen to what i'm saying the promise of the messiah could not do away with sin now you're following me i'll put it in between i see the seat of the woman that was wonderful but that could not eradicate sin all the types in the shadows of it all the prophecies all the things of david and his singing they pierced my hands and my feet that couldn't eradicate sin all right then we come to mary you could take many more you could come through promises you could come through like malachi three speaking of the coming of john the baptist four speaking of an end time prophet that would come that we'll get to as we go along in the story later on in the messages a few weeks from now probably but then something's going to take place right what a wonderful promise right i brought around and said i'd rather have a promise from god than all your securities you could give me right i can stand on the promise he spoke to me years ago and said you'll be there with your offspring i said that's my promise he said well he said that to me too well that's your promise that's not mine i'm not going to share mine with you well because i'm not i don't want to get rid of mine i don't want to give you half your family and i'll take a high for mine no you got to have your own brother said if you don't have faith for the others what did he say he said i doubt if you have saved faith for yourself all right that's what i want to hold on all right he gave me many promises but something like that i really love it now going back to what we said this morning that if you can see your name in the book right look at the promises in the book just find yourself i remember brother george canada he used to rejoice about it because he had that scripture and i read it to his funeral blessed is a man whose quiver is full well he said i looked that up one time i never did try to check it i took his word it means seven and he had seven arrows in their quiver well that meant they had seven kids you know and see brother george held on to that well have you ever had a promise i mean something god promised you can just to me that's a revelation that's calling your name you understand what i'm saying this morning the calling your name is the revelation of the hour that's speaking to you how many times i've ever told you this it's a secret of a gift but then you have to know how it works for it to work so you ain't worried about it i've tried to explain something to you about a secret of a gift your family needs saved your children your wife your husband et cetera and you're sitting listening to somebody preaching and that just begins to unfold have you ever done that it just unfolds right in front of you and you just see a picture unfold i've tried to tell you at that time just raise your hand and say my children my husband my wife he said what good is that try and see it just might work see when i'm needing something from god i wait for a revelation to start unfolding and during that revelation i claim what i'm desiring you see one revelation is more important than anything in the world you know why because just for a split second you've done entered eternity when something is revealed to you it may be a split second i've heard people say the lord talked all day to me well i know that i know how it heals but well brother gary's sitting there shaking his head i know what he's talking about sometimes i go for months before he speaks to me about something he'll speak about one thing you know what i do i spend months preaching about that one thing until he speaks to me again you know why because it's a revelation the revelation is eternity now get the point of what i'm saying as each one of those men we talked about in all of the old testament saints it was something personal about them they couldn't conquer the enemy you think samson with a jawbone of an old donkey that would one hit that had been gone and he kills a thousand people even they didn't have the big old thick helmets that right around said inch thick just one or two whacks with an old dead donkey's jawbone it's gone but you see he had a promise they just goofed up with sampson always like that you know he didn't have no eyeballs but why in the world didn't them dummies keep his hair cut off you think about it see that i thought well we got him blind what can he do well brother said he reached back there and feel that her in his life and said he know god was with him that was a promise when he walked in there with that little boy he said well his son just showed me where them two pillars is that i'm sure they had some kind of a big anchors hung into them and you know they probably wasn't 90 feet apart it was pretty close right where he got right in the middle because you'd put them together you know these builders know what i'm talking about because that's your main structure so he told that little boy he said son just put me where the let me get a hold that pillar he said is the other one on the other side yeah he said okay son you leave right i believe he did i believe he said son you get out of here something can happen go down and run my hand through locks on my hair i'm ready to die with my enemy the great thing if i ever get to teaching i'm going to start preaching i love to preach without even notes or anything you know if you see here all i got this written down stuff but listen we see that one day finally mary got a revelation and she said be it unto me according to thy word even though an angel spoke to her i didn't make it come to pass she said be it unto me according to that word a child was born but you know now listen that child couldn't die for my sins or yours even though that was the seed of the woman right he couldn't die when he was a year old two years old five years old he couldn't die when he was over there in the temple at somewhere between 12 13 14 whatever you want to make him but he could begin to understand how would you like to read the scrolls in the bible and when you read it you begin to understand that's talking about me we love the good ones don't we right we love the promises the good ones but what about the the things that are the natural part of the book we were talking about this morning you know it shows how dirty we are and what wrong we are and what we've done what we need to get rid of but you know after all is said and done let's see who was it david when god offered him said you can do this you can do that you can take this he offered him there one time remember he'd done wrong and he said whatever you desire will be given to you david said put me in the hands of god in other words god you decide that's just plain talking you know god you decide what it's going to be he could have been offered a lot of things he was but he said you just whatever because he knew in the hands of god he'd be better off than all the other things he could think about doing judgment is not too bad when you think that way but you see the words of a woman that had a virgin mind virgin womb brought forth the seed of the woman all right bringing forth that seed of the woman i said he couldn't die right there yet he was there proclaimed to be almighty god but when he was there at the temple he couldn't die but he could he begin then to see what would take place he gets down on the river jordan and he becomes as the prophet says the fullness of the godhead bodily what does that mean well he wasn't god didn't he become god now where'd you get that idea you didn't get it out of the bible and you didn't get it from the prophet now you must have got it somewhere else and i'd say it's downstairs all right no boogerman's idea but you see he begins to realize after he's anointed there on the river jordan he realizes that that's fulfilling of the scripture he gets over there and he's talking one day and he said the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel that's wonderful that he began to see that but you know what else began to be revealed to him every time he'd read i read the psalmist they pierced my hands and my feet see we only deal with this day this scripture is fulfilled at one point but every time he read them scriptures he knew where he was walking that's right he knew that he was going to die now that i've ever always tried to explain you know we got the only religion in the world that our god had to die show me another one anywhere any other religion that is dependent upon the death of their god everybody else is in the life of their god you know but our whole dependence is upon whether or not he was god or not that's why i argue with those brothers hard about saying he wouldn't go until the river jordan well who was he and if the anointing left him who did he become and what happened to him because you see that wasn't the god that i'm talking about that's said in the garden i'll go with you and it'll take me 4 000 years of types and shadows and promises i said one day it'll come into reality one day i'll stand on this earth he goes through many things in his life horrible life all he ever done was good i never could understand that as a baptist i used to read the bible i thought god how is this this man never done nothing but good and they killed him for being good see i couldn't understand they didn't kill him that's right the other day no they didn't kill him he gave his life there was no way to take his life there was no way to kill even that physical man standing there until god said it can be done amen you want to pro quo to the prophet satan can't get you until god is through with you we listened to him another day there and he said there you was you come up to about somewhere 18 20 years old said god took a picture said you got married and said you want to he said god took a picture said he turned around to the devil and said okay satan get after him that's where he said it said take him down but said you can't take his life until i tell you well i can't die until he tells the devil you can have him death is my not my master it's my slave but listen see the mystery of the entire bible of the plan of redemption is the fact that somebody is going to have to die to give you something boys had to be the right kinsmen right but remember there was one closer ken than moaz right because we were kind of folks to the devil folks the new birth makes us ken folks to god but it would mean someone would have to come and die so now we see the predestinated plan of god as it comes into view that he would come down and live with you and i even in the sinful condition of a lost generation or genealogy or what you want to call it yet he would deal with us he would do everything he could to try to help us but then he knew he had to die he had to give his life because that was the only way that a redeemer could come he said no no no no wait a minute brother dale the birth gave a redeemer hey i got a little sense of dead okay i ask you a question why did jesus have to die okay he was standing there he was a redeemer why couldn't he just turn around there and say this is the way it is that's the way it is that's the way it is i'm going to speak it he was our redeemer he was the seat of the woman that's right why did they have to turn out the way it did he was dire to redeem right like everybody says in the message today you know always was eternal whether you didn't need jesus that's right right he said no then brothers ain't saying that well why don't you ask them you know that's the best way to know and really the best way to do is find somebody in their church and ask them don't ask them because they'll lie to you no brother i'm not saying that you can't show quote where i've ever said anything like that well why does the whole congregation believe it right then you let them stay there and believe it but listen god's predestinated plan now comes into view through the kinsman redeemer boaz didn't have to die right but why did this man have to die when he was a kinsman he was my brother but you see folks they had to be more to the story you and i were lost if he did not die he could have taken care of these bodies are you listening because he'd have been my brother but that didn't work because you got to start on the inside and work your way out he didn't have to die to make me to where i could have been like adam now are you listening in body because he could have stopped time and put us back in the garden i hope you're listening because i wondered how this was going to end up i told you what i like to preach instead of teach teach i got my notes down there i know what i'm going to say now i don't know what i'm gonna say he could have spoke it into existence and made the world back like adam do you believe that come on are you are you i mean do you believe it but you see that would only put us living without death in the body right come on did the prophet say that about adam said the tree of life was in the in the garden to remind adam that his youth was being renewed i think that's future home but you see folks he knew that that would put you like adam after the fall did you listen adam after the fall would be what jesus would have done had he spoke things into existence annihilated the devil by his words it wouldn't have put you back like adam really was in the beginning and that wouldn't have been his predestinated plan what was it predestinated plan sure number one to redeem mankind number two was to what reveal himself as savior healer redeemer god how many manifestations would you want to put there but you realize that that wasn't all of it you're gonna see these notes i got written down here but i really changed right there let's forget that page later on i'm trying to talk to you about the plan of redemption revealed but you see he knew inside of him was eternal life that you and i needed even though he could handle the flesh parts and speak into existence stop time and do whatever it would not put us back like adam because brother random on black feminist names what'd he say especially into adam he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and he became a living soul with a living god eternal person he said right you see if you just live physically what good would that do this would he have been my brother he could have been my redeemer to stop death right but he wouldn't have been my savior he wouldn't have been my father he'd only been my brother so it was necessary that he died that's the mystery of what we're trying to bring out about the plan of redemption the mystery is that god would have to come in flesh don't worry about it because the next message we'll drop right back here start up and see how he come in flesh all right but he would have to die to release that life that was within him see if he released that life then he can be my savior he might have been my healer he might have been my brother but when that life come out he became a savior he became my father you remember he's the beginning of the creation of god do you remember what we're talking about wednesday night we are the continuation of that creation the prophet said amen so it wouldn't have been no bringing forth to the offsprings of god you see god's predestinated plan now comes into view because he could come down and live with us in jesus christ right but by giving that life he can live in us who the seed of the woman the seed of the woman the christ right amen by giving his life brother branham literally said it this way he said god tore the soul out of that body now what does it mean no he exodus out of him didn't he god was inside of that body right a body that has prepared me he exited out of that body at calvary right to be able to give you and i a new birth to where we could become the offspring of god see we're the offspring of god internally we're kin folks of the devil still out in the flesh whether you like that or not you tell me what you are oh my lineage is perfect well great that makes you confused to the devil in a pure form what else is going to make it i don't like the way you preach well good pray for me but is it the truth amen paul said i've overcome your enemy's got to tell you the truth but you see what i'm saying john the baptist they're speaking introduced him to the world and said what behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world now what was he saying behold the woman's seed that will die to release his life and when he come out of the garden that was what he fully intended to do yet he couldn't live with us in his fullness and all the types we gave but one day he came in human flesh he could live with us but he still couldn't live in us it would take his death to make the ability for god to live in you and i right now let me just run on fire while we're at it because see god's predestinated plan doesn't end with this calvary it doesn't end on the day of pentecost god's predestinated plan doesn't end with you getting a new birth because you see he didn't speak these bodies back to not being old did he he didn't do that did he no because he knew what he was going to do he's going to come and live in us and by coming and living in us he could bring us to a place one day to be as the bible said it will be like unto him because with our bodies like unto his glorious body right right you see he made a way for everything all right see there remains one thing one mystery the mystery redemption of the new birth has been made known the mystery of the baptism of the holy ghost has been made known the mystery of eternal life to a human being has been made known and been made manifest by many believers but we're still facing death that's why i want that lamb to come in this day with the seven horns and seven eyes same lamb right same lamb that was on the river jordan behold the lamb of god is the same lamb i'm talking about this morning standing here in the end time in bright form right to fulfill revelations everywhere it talks about one like unto the son of man gird about the paps right in a feminist form in the bride but you see what he's got to do now he's got to come on the scene to be able to change these bodies our bodies were claimed listen your prophet covered i'm pretty sure it's future home he said when that blood of jesus christ dropped back on this earth it claimed our bodies because our bodies come out of this earth right so we're already claimed all right the day you get the new birth in the soul god lays claims of these bodies that's why we're not going to get a new body that's right it's done being claimed back there and he made the claim for sure when you came to live in this body and he gave you the new birth what are you going to need a new body for well this old body just ain't worth nothing that's right that's why he's going to redeem it adam was the top of it right just the type of it because in this day it's not going to be go back to just live forever or death do not take us it's going to go to glorified bodies all right see the kinsmen paid the price but he's got to come in this last days you notice what i read in the scripture until the redemption of the purchase possession now why would paul be so ignorant to think because he'd be ignorant if there wasn't something to happen in this day where he says in verse 14 which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession under the praise of his glory this end time is promised not just eternal life not even just the face of the fathers he just promised a change of these bodies right i read around said why would you he said if i drop a book i picked the same book back up you know a lot of people still believe that they're going to get a new body in this message i have to brought around all the quotes and i i just got one to me that just seals it don't matter if i didn't even have a quote from brother brown when jesus raised he had nail press in his hands is that right the bible says put your finger here in my hand put it in my side well yet he was standing there in a glorified body i can't understand that brother dale i ain't asking you to understand it i'm asking you to believe it it's not to try to understand something it's to ask god for a revelation settles a lot of problems remember all that adam lost jesus christ came to restore adam lost the ability of this body to be made eternal he had eternal life within him but the coming forth of the christ seed of the woman in the second coming of christ what brother run say that was the bride coming out of the church what are you saying well i thought second coming from up to this guy coming up hey we're right we don't see it that way it's a secret mystery to the bride it's as i said this morning brother and said have we heard his voice through the opening of these seals and we heard his voice and we heard him calling her name or the revealing of the word unto us because that's going to conquer satan in the second coming of christ he's going to restore all things in the bride coming of christ is what your prophet said we saw then the redeemed kinsman redeemer he not only died but what's the point he not only died to pay the prices he rose again so that everybody else that would be in the grave would have the ability to come out right heroes if i go i can raise all right but he walked into eternal life because he was raised in eternal life and that ain't all the story he went up in a rapture right you don't know who was made eternal he went up in a rapture so that seals it for all of us but around said he'll become visible among us raise the dead and we'll go in the rapture and that's not a corporal coming because he doesn't come corporally physically until the millennium we meet him in the air in the same body he's in all right see the plan of redemption the full plan of redemption these bodies has got to be redeemed he said it's already done it's already done but it ain't took possession amen now back up just a second what we read right at the lights this morning he's got to stay on that mercy seat until that last person is born again right and when he does he'll leave the mercy seat oh no he left it back under well he was dead then that's what he said you're dead and lost but he'll come forth in this last days the prophet said visible then say physical is it visible among us we'll raise you raise the dead and we'll go in the rapture that's a promise we've got many promises to wait until we can see him have you heard his voice through the opening of the word what other voice would you want to hear an audible an audible satan can impersonate that remember like the old fella told he said the boys wondered about whether he was called to preach or not so he decided to have him out he crawled up in a tree outside the road and a guy come walking by and he said john he stopped but john said you called to preach he said you know that guy's been preaching 50 years and how could i tell him now that it wouldn't god all right how do we know god didn't use that but do you understand the plan of redemption and it still involves predestination and remember the quotes the other day brother around and said he predestinated a seed for each age and he predestinated a people to live that age then he still knows before knowledge we just don't live before knowledge we better start living by predestination instead of some foreign knowledge well if i was saved i'll be saved no the bible says let the redeemed say so the bible says to confess right right well if i'm predestinated it's a good thing but it just won't hold true folks you won't hold true for the hour you and i are supposed to be to a place that we believe what god says and even doubt our own doubts in other words doubt our own great revelations that we've got where are we standing let's stand we're ready for the communion brothers you ready ready for the communion the time that we can really you know what the prophet said communion is to communicate so we talk to god he talks to us we communicate then we have a physical communion that we do once a month always be in the first sunday of the month and then that's what i like to do with communion on the watch night service you know let everybody else hoop law and do what they want to the first of the year we just take the communion and then we go downstairs because it's always plenty to eat you don't have to go home or run the waffle house or danny calls them awful house you don't have to go to them we just sit down and eat and have a good time together in a new year you know what a new dear means or a new day means it means more of god's word is to be revealed right made known unto us in the plan of redemption forever received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you just do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had slept saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this due year as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do you the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep where we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened to the lord that we should not be condemned with the world i thank god for that scripture wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together into condemnation rest while i sit in order when i come he brought around and said paul was saying that because they were just getting together and eating a meal you know and there was more of the meal than there was the communion you know there was they just get together and eat well that's not exactly the way it is there's even people in this message that won't eat eat after taking communion i'm not going to fuss with them i mean that day the rest of that day they won't eat anything i'm not going to fuss with them i'm just going to say it it's never been made known to me to do it that way so we take the communion if you take it in the morning in the evening or night whatever it's to take in a communion not whether or not i'm eating or doing whatever the rest of the day there's people that will not eat on the grounds of a church because they believed that brother ryan said those things well that's all right that's their business that ain't lula you know i'd like it to be worth it we had a fellowship hall built off to itself yes but we can't afford it so we got one in the church and why go build another one somewhere else now it's just going like it is big old brother i told you about it he was coming in the door he used to be right here opened the doors and brought in the communion trays and this big old brother in the message he said brother dale he was preaching that sunday he said brother dale he said all the believers use one cup i just opened the door and walked on in and i said we believe part of it i just went off i wouldn't go to hearken with him i said brother mo what did he do at the tabernacle he said he had many cups that's okay thank you you know but yet you can find a quote where brother brown said he would like one cup baby and that's all right i'm not going to argue and fuss with nobody that's just what i am you know and at least you don't have to play around wonder what i am i tell you i'll tell you where i stand okay but the bible said here that they target one for another so let's just pray a little bit silently before the lord before we go into this communion or just forgive our sins cleanse us of all unrighteousness make us worthy to partake of this communion in jesus name amen the bible said it he took bread and he blessed it father we thank you for this bread it was made for this purpose today and we thank you for it we ask you now that you just sanctify it and sanctify the partakers that we may all be one together in you in jesus name amen you know we don't have a promise that we're going to be around here eternally so nanny just let lisa step up some of them and they're they're making the bread a lot of times well that's good because we need the ones to be ready in case you know god is preparing a way for all of us and he'll make a way it's not that we're guaranteed to stay around here we're not i'm guaranteed one thing every what it is i he wants me to do i won't do it you know i want to walk in the light of his love and just follow after it no matter what it costs or what's going on and i can just say well lord you just have your way let us be what you want us to be can you say amen father we thank you for this wine and we know that it's made for the purpose of taking the communion and we pray that you would just bless each one lord as we partake the bread is a symbol of your body it is not your body it's a symbol of it the wine is a symbol of your blood it's not your blood it's just a symbol but we get to do these things while we're here and we realize the reason we can do this here we've ate of your body through the opening of the word we've drank of your spirit through the quickening of the holy ghost to reveal yourself unto us so we really know what the communion's all about then it is truly a communion is talking and listening to our lord and savior sanctify the wine and the partakers now in jesus name amen come morning i walk by the river i'll rest me the ever green tree i'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes i'm despised and rejected and i question father how long then i take one more at mount calvary and it gives me the strength to go come morning i'll walk by the river i'll rest me the ever green tree i'll carry you my cross through the midnight come mourn there's glory for me you know to be able to just understand i always think about it even though the great apostles were used and even though as we were talking about this morning about john and his prophetic realm but you know it's always something personal to everybody john wasn't chosen to explain the communion that was left for the apostle paul paul came forth and explained it he could pick up those types and shadows and bring it forth and he could see what went on everybody's got a job to do let's just do our job fill in the pew singing a song playing an instrument whatever just be what was supposed to be and that way god can honor it and manifest itself right um let's all protect together you can be seated till we get everything prepared you'd like to turn in your scripture turn to john 13. supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas's carrot simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from god and went to god he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel inverted himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to simon peter and peter said unto him lord lest i wash my feet jesus answered and said unto him what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter peter saith unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if i wash thee not die has no part with me simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands in my head jesus saith unto him he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but he's clean ever wit and you're clean but not all for in you who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know you what i've done to you you call me master and lord and you say well for so i am if i then your lord and master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for i've given you an example that you should do as i have done to you verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them let's stand together father we just commit everything now into your hands this day and all the time and what we've tried to say and now we've come to the communion the foot washing and then we'll be traveling home and we pray that you bless everybody give everybody a safe journey let your love be made manifest those traveling this evening or whatever we pray you'd be with them have your way we love you we thank you in jesus name amen the sisters are dismissed you can go downstairs there is a name
