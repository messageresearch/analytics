to be in the house of the Lord good to have each and every one of you here again like I said it's just Home Folks today well Mah M's decided it's not home folks but that's okay am I on I'm sorry sister Lily has she's just one of us now so brother mikah is too it's good to have him today with us amen good to have him I'm going give you an update here let me get finished with this I'll give you an update on brother Mike I went over there yesterday and U after work and went to visit him and U he's got a long road to go and he's 80 years old but that don't mean nothing to God when brother Brown said brother Dow I'll shake your hand again brother D was in his 90s all kind of problems and issues but when he to pray for him uh he does have a a brain bleed they're not concerned with that um he was T-Bone the the lady hit him in his side so that's where the most damage was and um his head hit the hit the column didn't have side airbags it's a Ford but anyway um he he told me he was still in pretty good spirits he said you know what he said somebody said if you didn't drive a forge you wouldn't go in the Raptor I said you're not going to be driving that Ford no more I promise you that it actually hit so hard it knocked the motor out of it it broke the motor away from the transmission that's how that's how hard it hit and U that was pretty rough and but anyway so he's got a brain bleed they not worried about that that had a little cover over his head um he had strong handshake we held hands for about 20 minutes and and and talked about the Lord and talked about you know things that were going on um he was actually going to um a brother in his church had died and he was going to visit the family to set up the arrangements for the funeral and that's when he pulled out in front of the lady and and uh and got hurt so just remember that family too in prayer because brother Mike won't be able to do the do the funeral and U but he's got a brain bleed He's Got U they're not crack rib they're broke cuz they punctured his lung cuz it hit on this side punctured his lung uh so they drained the fluid out of his um out of his lung so he's doing better there his arm from here to here is is um well Sister Janet said bad and it was in one of those aircast so you couldn't really see uh what was going on but that's not a concern either he had open heart surgery a year ago almost to the well not to the day but to the month or two and um I guess being 80 you heal slower we know that but when he hit it tore a piece of his aorta now I know you that know your medical terms the aort is that big vessel and even the even at at the time if they had him open and on the operating table that a or to burst they cannot save him but there's there's a God there's a blood clot that's keeping it from bursting right now so they're going in tomorrow laproscopic and they're going to try to repair or put a shunt stin whatever you you st in that part to keep him stable but he is immobile he can't move he does have all his wits about him yeah he was still joking yesterday but that's brother Mike sister Janet's okay she had to wear that collar she she didn't break anything the first report was she broke her her big bone in her leg but that was not it just was bruised and so she was up there and she and I and Sister Sarah um had a conversation outside after we left brother Mike I just keep him in prayer because it's going to be a long road long recovery for our brother but we need to get we need to pray him through this aort apart first that's that's that's the pending thing right now his his his arms not lifethreatening he the doctor said the brain bleed he he's had two uh CAT scans and they said it's not getting any worse it's getting better so even within two days it's getting better so they're not worried about the brain bleed so we're not worried about that and the arm will take care of itself later on and so will the ribs but that aorta he's just listen you and I are that far from Death anyway right here today right heart just quit pumping you're gone have a blowout you're gone so by the grace of God we're here and by the grace of God he's still here so we're just going to keep him in prayer and just keep holding him up before the Lord so that he'll get better again I told him that we would help all we could in our assembly we we would help his assembly any way we could as far as um sending preachers or are taking care of the U Church work because you know what church has got to go on we don't want this Shepherd smitten and the Sheep scatter he's got some good sheep over there he's got some good people and I told him we'd help him so we maybe later on after he gets out of the hospital we'll go I told him we'd meet at home and talk about that if he needed to but he just needs to get better now get that aorta fixed and get out of the hospital and but he's in really good care um there at Augusta University hospital so it's really good good facility and they've got him in ICU so only a couple of people can go see him at a time also I want you this is how God works Mark is his son and Mark has some problems and in life and about two years ago he turned away from the message and and uh hadn't spoken to his daddy in almost two years he was in there today or yesterday CU that was my first question I said where's Mark and Sister Sarah said I don't know I said I don't know if he'll come visit him or not well Janet comes out of the ICU and and uh she said oh you can go back there now said Mark's back there I thought well praise God there he was standing beside his daddy amen I've always had a soft spark for him because he's really emotional and I told him I said God's going to take care of your daddy son he but God needs to take care of him but that may had been just to drive them back together again we know God works in mysterious ways but I'm telling you we got to believe that God knows best it doesn't matter if we don't think he knows best he knows best he's got this thing already figured out and like I said before the Lord's knows are the best yeses you'll ever get amen but he let brother Mike go down this road for a reason and we know that he'll not forsake Him and he'll I believe he'll bring him out of that amen bring him home and uh and Men quicker than than than uh the doctors will ever think he'll menend because what Janet said about his arm was that it was really bad but they're not concerned with it right now because of the side that was hit it was really crushed he could he could move his hand just a little bit I asked him I said are you hurting he said only when I cough or burp he had to take some medicine it was making him burp well that part in his chest was hurting and that's about the only he said other than that he said I'm not hurting of course they probably had him on some pain medicine but just just keep him in prayer I needed to go see him he he's he's been a a rock for this whole for our family for years and years and years he's he's just a fountain of wisdom and that's what I said going over I said God don't take that away from me don't take that away from your bride we need that man we need his wisdom and we need his comfort he's just a comfort to be around man we all know brother Mike only for years so let's remember him in prayer special prayer every time you go to your knees you pray for brother Mike oti amen and we'll hear some good reports brother Aaron will be preaching for us Wednesday night remember the bethl camp will be coming up pretty quick uh we get all that together I think some of them are flying in on Wednesday from Ohio excuse me I got a little tickle in my throat also remember after the second service we'll have Pastor appreciation

we'll have our Thanksgiving dinner and by the way if you can find a whole turkey buy it I'm not kidding there will be a very bad shortage of turkeys before Thanksgiving so if you find a whole turkey buy buy about five or six of them and I'll buy some of them from you but they only got turkey breast now at Walmart but the Avon bird flu took over earlier this year and killed a like 40 something million uh turkeys and uh chickens so so buy your turkeys early that's that's won't cost you anything for that one but just make sure you buy buy you some turkeys if you like turkeys for than

let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this day that you give us thank you for the word for the Holy Spirit now I pray that that Holy Spirit Will water the word Lord and it'll sink deep in our heart Lord today as we talk about you just for a few moments Lord we've made all the announcements we sang our songs we took up the offering we've done responsive reading now I pray Lord that all these promises that you have in store for us that you'll just dump them on us today Lord just give us a double portion of your blessing today Father be with brother Mike Lord and just continue to keep him on our heart and everyone here the people all over the world praying for him that'll beat back that devil of sickness that'll take that'll take that room right now and just illuminate with the angel standing around that bed for that Soldier that's been laboring for years Lord we pray that You' just come now Lord and and keep the pain away and and the doctors are going to do what they're going to do but Lord You're the Healer you're the one that's going to put that peace back together in this AA the doctors going to do the best they can Lord so I pray Lord that you will guide the doctor's hand tomorrow Lord and the brother Mike will be up and Home in no time father Lord we give you all the praise and honor and the glory in Jesus name Amen in the beginning was the word word was with God this is part 65 I think I missed that I think it's 65 all right and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth 1 Thessalonians 4 says that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor and now this is where we'll talk a little bit more today about the mind I hadn't been able to get off of it I've been thinking a little bit more and we'll get into it as we go you know brother Brown said the right mental attitude 57 times I was reading you we're going to read them this afternoon we'll read them a few of them I got them run off for you in there the right mental attitude not your working up not your not your uh getting a gold star for reading your Bible not coming to church ever Sunday the right mental attitude toward any promise of God will bring it to pass any promise we say well that's for healing no any promise this statue of perfect man is promised to make us into the image of God right and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your minders telling brother Bob you know brother brandham spent all the time telling you that remember you got to take it from here down to here right that 16 inches between here to here you got to have it drop from mental to here well now in the end time though we've got to take it from here and bring it back up to here because we got to have the mind of Christ we got to have the renewing of our mind we can't be a double-minded man we can't be a double-minded bride we've got to take what's here now and break it up to here and then what that's where the body change comes you get born again then you start back up here for the body change that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor that you be not what conformed but trans formed by the renewing of your mind what that you may prove you're proven today amen you're proving today one way or the other where God's right or the devil's right and we know the devil's not right you just don't have the right mental attitude what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God you may be seated Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word just pray for me today I know why I got a tickle in my throat but remember now as we were talking about as we went through through all this and with the summation of everything I've been trying to get you to see um Luke 8 verse 45 brother collie read it Mark remember somebody touched Jesus's garment and she was made whole so she had to write mental attitude she said if I can get to him if I can just touch His Garment not him pray not him do anything just me touch His Garment then I'll be made whole all right that's how simple it is what we try to do is is we get it up here so much till we this is where we muddle it up listen if you're born again in your soul that's God that's positive that's Eternal everybody with me right here this is where the Battle Ground is not here you've already fought the Battle if you got the new birth now if you don't have the new birth then you still got a battle down here you got a heart battle you need to change your heart but once you get a change your heart and you know you you preachers around the message just like I said you got that group group over here that says well we got to get them you know we got to get um emotional and it's over here we don't need the emotion we need the word bring them together always this church has always been balanced bring it together bring it to where we do get emotional every once in a while but as me and brother Bob was talking listen folks let me tell you something this church has no excuse to not go up the statue of perfect man none none none right why because you got churches that are still preaching two Soul Doctrine you got churches in the message is still preaching two Lords you got people message preaching Daniel 70 weeks wrong you got them preaching the seals wrong you got all these wrong doctrines God is going yes God will I promise you he'll bring some of them up but not as a body as a church body he can't do that he cannot bring you up that statute of perfect man with false word that's why Peter is the one that started on the day of Pentecost and then now Peter comes to bring these Faith virtue all temp face God his brotherly kindness right cuz he had them I'm going to read you a quote here in a few minutes where brother Brown said the apostles were not like us wow the apostles were not like us they would step out preach a sermon and didn't care what anybody thought about them and they walked off I'll read it to you here in just a few minutes right amen because remember they had all these virtues they didn't have false Doctrine sure there was Grievous wolves sure there was uh little things that was going on little foxes that were spoiling the vine but there was a true church there and that true church was being built on what the statue of a perfect man they just didn't have the headstone and that's what me and you got to have this right before the headstone can come there's no way you can put a roof on a house unless you got the walls right right oh you might want to but it's going to fall it's going to fall it's not going to stay steady brother BR said in the statute of pray man said the first thing you got to do is be born again I'm trying to harp on this more and more really don't think you're born again you got to know that you know that you know that that has dropped from a mental attitude down to here then let that work its way back up into your mind and that's where the battle is I read your scripture man where James says a double-minded man is unstable should I go to church should I not that's the promise of God Amen should I or should I you see where the battle is listen if y'all don't have a battle then I'm just preaching to me and I'm going to just keep preaching to me till I get okay all right the rest of y'all can just sit there and look at me with a bug eyes if you want to but what he talking about no you got to become a new creation though you got to be able to when Monday comes you got to be able to what deserve discern when the devil talks to you because like brother D's always said the devil the devil is not one of these no he's got a nice little sweet voice oh go ahead it's not going to hurt anything just do it go ahead it go ahead God may be the one that says hey dummy stop I'll read you a quote here this afternoon where brother brandham gave us a formula to get what we need he gave us a formula it starts with knowing the will of God first not your will that's right may we talking about selfishness we've got to get away there's no way we can come up the statue of perfect man and be selfish you got to be able to give what you got am give what you got to me that's virtue Jesus gave what he had Peter and and and whoever it was at the Peter and John at the gate beautiful they gave what they had Silver and Gold Have I None but what I have not what I can go read in a quotebook come on somebody wait till I go to church on Wednesday we ought to try doing that every once in a while come to church on Wednesday and let me just get this little added no they were walking down the road and they were going probably going to Walmart let me bring it to now and this guy standing backer and he says I need some money and joh Peter's like we're poor but what I have I'm going to give it to you and what strength virtue went out of him to what give that guy what he had been what listen that guy had been from his youth had had that infirmary from his youth he said Silver and Gold Have i n but such as I have give I unto thee rise up and walk amen so now we we're commissioned this is our commission leave the principal of the doctrine of Christ as I said before people can make excuse in different places but Mo listen more is given more is required all right so you've been given more we've been given more so we're required somebody is going to break this chain of death it just might as well be us amen it just might as well be me and you it just may as well be right here in this congregation today start you got to start somewhere today is the day of your salvation let us go on into Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance to dead works and Faith toward God you know I was thinking the other day in my mind we let that thing so overcome us amen remember I'm going to tell you here in just a few minutes it's all in your head come on how many times have you fabricated something in your head and it never come to to pass about 6 million this week amen never come to pass it never even turned out the way you thought it would turn out that's your thinking but when God thinks about something it always comes to pass and that's why we have to shift into that Mind Of God right let this come up here let this come up here that's why you got to be born again here let this come up into what not stinking thinking of the world but the thinking in the mind of Christ but the doctrines of baptism laying on our hands resurrection of the Dead we need did not get away from that as far as putting it to the side but we need to build on that we need to build on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone we need to build what build up a house how listen to the word of God listen to the apostles prophets evangelist pastors and teachers for what the perfecting of the the Saints they asked brother brown one time said brother Brown we can't get perfect how many times you ever heard somebody tell you that I just can't perfect you ain't perfect yeah well the Bible say You're supposed to be for the perfecting of the Saints me and you for the work of the ministry the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come what to the unity of the faith look and see it's not a Unity at all we're divided even in the message were divided amen but the world is so divided they don't know what's right they don't know what's wrong I went to get blood the other day and you know what you ought to get blood if you can sorry you're helping human being June jun's like a gallion zillionaire she's giv so many gallons of blood there's more of her in that building than they are sitting here today they love her buddy they get the pump out when she comes in you know it's like fill her up or or take it away from her anyway so I went and gave blood and they asked me the first question at Birth are you a male or a female wow hold on a minute I'm not done the next question is do you still still consider yourself and you had to check one of the two now that you're in other words you're older do you consider yourself still a male in other words help me Lord and I told that lady sitting there I think it was Yolanda was sitting there and I said she said you have to answer the question so I answered the question so now listen they should be no more gender reveal parties cuz the world says we're supposed to wait till they're five or six and let them decide if they're a boy or a girl so why do you need to shoot something and make pink go off when that girl wants to be a boy you see how Sodom and gomorra wasn't this bad you know why Sodom and gomar didn't have internet and didn't have all these sites and ites and websites and all that other kind of stuff right but you and I if this promise is we got to come to the unity of faith we will do that under the measure of the statute of the fullness of Christ look that we henceforth be no more children be no more babies tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slot of men what preachers and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and weight to deceive but look speaking the truth and love may grow up now the truth and love is the correct Doctrine May grow up in Him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body now you and I are the body not your natural body but your body the body of Christ fitly joined together and compacted like I said before you better make sure you get it compacted because the devil will absolutely stick his nasty finger wherever you got a crack amen but it's promised that we're going to be compacted it's promised that in this age you know a long time ago when they couldn't fly a rocket up into the atmosphere you know they just got an airplane and the airplane as I explained to you a long time ago about the speed of sound when you get that whatever his name was Chuck Jagger he would get almost to the speed of sound or the other people and they would stop cuz everything started shaking they thought it's going to explode but what did Chuck Jager do he said I don't know what I did I just pushed it on forward and went further when you broke when you break that sound barrier it's just like cool water he said it just straightened well that's what me and you push it I'm telling you today push it push it to its limit because listen God Has No Limit well I don't know he may shake me shake me shake me but look take that stick and push it Forward take that stick and push it up the statue of perfect man cuz it like listen the right mental attitude you got to ask God for virtue God let me take what I got teach me how to use it that's why he gave us Apostles prophets pastors teaching in evangels to what to teach us how to do it amen to teach us how to become listen Paul never in his life everybody with me it's hot in here never and y'all going to start falling asleep Aaron if you don't come up come please come up here and check this thing out turn it on I know we're in between Seasons it's cold outside and it's warm in here and then when you balance it out the air conditioner never comes on because that's cool out there but we need some air conditioning right now but we need the mind of Christ we don't need to what be conformed to the world so listen when we start up this statue of perfect man we've got to be totally contrary to our whole life our whole General Life we've got to be totally contrary totally contrary to everything you have grown up in your life whether you're 80 or eight amen everybody with me CU we got to take up his cross we do each one of us it's an individual affair with God it's not the preacher and you it's not your wife and you it's you and God that's right amen mama don't go won't hinder me sister don't go won't hinder me that's our problem like I said before and where do we fabricate that right here we fabricate it right here in our brain I'm going to find that quote somebody said I'll find it somewhere and I know brother if I do say well brother Joe's up here usually when I say something he's up there he goes here's what he said but there was somebody a doctor or somebody a psychologist said you spend 90% of your time worrying about stuff or about like Donnie what Donnie thinks of me and what this one thinks of me when they spend 2% worrying about about you you spend 90% of your time worried about what everybody else thinks about you and they're not worried about you at all they got their own problems to worry about I'll find that though I Die daily Paul said but Paul never let me get back to Paul never heard about a seal right Paul died before John went to patmas he never heard of seal one Seal two seal three he really never heard of the church ages right everybody with me now he probably had some he knew he had something to do with Ephesians because he knew he was their messenger or the prophet and I'm pretty sure he knew he was a prophet when he was pinning all this thing but what he was doing he was pinning the seals so me and you can read them he never mentioned them but he said we need to know the Deep things of God we need to in other words we need to grow up we need to do this we need to do that you know Paul was a wonderful man but he died way before even John came on and then the then the the church age messenger started coming after that but we all look back brother Brown said what do we do we look back to Paul the pattern messenger so what he did we pattern after that he built churches he what did he do he helped them grow spent some time got a brother established and he went EST he didn't just say well bless God just do the best you can and he off no Paul was patient he would get them established in Ephesus he'd go to Corinth he may have spend a little more time in Corinth than he did anywhere else but they were Corinthians the book of Correction so the Corinthians they had all these kind of like us had all these sayings and doctrines and all these different issues and Paul what' you do he stayed there with them and he got a bride out of them because remember he listed all that whole stuff that we used to be wasn't good people he said but such were some of you but you're washed you're Sanctified in other words with the blood of Jesus Christ yes and Paul stood up one day and said now you going to be judged by what I say you going to be judged by my gospel folks you're going to be judged by the gospels preached here you're not going to be judged by the gospel preached in Happy Valley that's right or anywhere else you want to say right here this is where you're going to be judged by you're not even going to be judged by what said in Jeffersonville for so it is the will of God that with well-doing you may put to silence that's what I want to do put to silence the ignorance of foolish men you say brother way that's kind of hard can I read that one more time I didn't I didn't say that Peter did the one that says you got to have patience the one that said you got to have all these virtues said for so is the will of God that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men Israel in the church brother ra say now we got to come to full Doctrine I like good shout meetings and so do we we like that but now bubble dancing and all that stuff but when what in other words when Monday happens when the rubber meets the road when you're out there by yourself and you can't get to a a preacher you can't get to you know somebody that you what pull virtue from you got to start having it yourself you don't know where you're standing we must know as a church where we're standing amen let's get back and find out find out what's making us do that that's what we're doing today let's find out what's making us be still here 60 something years after the prophet said the rapture's overdue 60 years the rapture's overdue what's the problem look in the mirror no it's brother brother Brown's fault well no I don't think so no it's your fault but now look brother rown said all right look but when it comes to The Showdown that's what we're coming to folks I'm telling you just like I said before God is going to make you make a decision one way or the other you got to make a choice one way or the other before you pass away before you take your last breath are we going B into body change you're going to have to make a choice one way or the other that's right but when it comes of The Showdown are you able to possess the thing that you profess to have that's the thing brother we've got to get it we've got to take it it's ours but you'll fight for every inch that's right you know I've talked about Battleship and cruise ship you know on the cruise ship when we went on the cruise in June it was just so nice and everybody was so nice and the guys would you know bring us like nice Linens and and there was no enemies on that boat I mean we just had a good time when you get on on a battleship everybody on that ship including the cook knows how to fire a rifle including the cook and including the janitor and including the maintenance man he knows how to fight amen and when you know what when it said all hands on deck it meant all hands on deck there would be thousands of them like ants that'd run up there on the on the deck and start fighting cuz it's a battle it wasn't a cruise ship it was a battleship you either get killed or killed one of the two we've all tried every Christian every son every child that comes to God is Tried by the word to see if you'll be loyal to who tries you by the word God does amen God does that's right look at job that was job job was a righteous man good man did everything right look what happened to him but in the very end we're still talking about job is God still talking talking about you you think about that God still talking about you he's still we're still talking about job cuz you're written Epistles they're going to ask you I promise you when we get over there they're going to say what age did you come from they said we out of lay out of see they said come sit down and tell me cuz the Bible I read said y'all that was the nastiest age there ever was amen see if you'll be loyal to it when The Showdown comes how many times I show there's going to be a showdown folks yes you're either going to be ready for it though but now what if you took the battleship and the cruise ship and switched all the crew people the cruise ship over here their crew goes over here and gets in the battleship what's they going to do I just know how to put knives and forks on the table and these over here are saying well I didn't I'm not equipped how can I fight with this but you know what them that are trying to fight they still going to take that fight over there in that cruise ship and if they have to use knives and force they'll kill you with them same way with the devil brother R said if you don't if you don't have no teeth in your head say G him to death chew on him don't let that guy have any upper hand cuz where is it at not here if you're born again it's right here right here is where we're losing it in the mind that's right memory reason conscious affection imagination that's all in your head amen I thank God we're still going to have memory we're definitely still going to have memory when we get there right but it's not going to be memory of the bad it's going to be memory of the good it's not going to be a memory that hey like brother Mike I was thinking about that I said you know when we get over on the other side he's not even going to have a pen in his body Danny where you at buddy now you a scar that's what God will do that's the power of God that'll take your body change it take all the scars out of it put everything back if you had your pendants took out they put the pendants back in all that it's a change of the body everybody with me amen so you ought to be happy this is just light Affliction if you ask Michel today what is your problem he said oh this is just light Affliction cuz what it's his attitude amen and he that cannot stand chastisement but goes on with the world he is an illegitimate child and not and Son and Daughter of God certainly not you know I thinking the know day you got Paul Paul's preaching away and he's preaching and and he's uh he's he's he's telling the people about the resurrection and then all of a sudden who is it Philipus and hus they go off and start preaching his doctrine that the resurrection had already come well you know he didn't mind rebuking them from the pull pit hello somebody he said Simon the copper Smith has caused me all kind of problems the seven sons of scha they're against me yes Deus has forsaken me that's right and that's in the Bible right but the spiritually minded catches the word lines up with it and the spirit comes down under the shed blood and takes that person you know you would be a you would be a celebrity if you said this alien came down Jonas Jonas said this alien came down and took me up in a ship and he had like one eye he's green but he spoke English he'd be a celebrity but tell somebody that you had what God come on come down amen and take you somewhere in your soul take you into another dimension and change your mind and make your attitude different you're not going to be on the front page of to the paper you're going to be in the back part where they put the nuts I was abducted by an alien didn't the Bible say we're aliens huh we're alienated we're aliens of this world when you get to New Birth God comes down and burns out the old you the old world and it makes you a new Creator new creature New Creation look it's a paradox remember we talked about the three Hebrew children we'll continue through that but remember every time you go through a trouble or a trial remember it's to loose you because the heavenly father is not going to ever bind you right he's going to loose you so everything you go through and that's sometimes what a man has to do come out make his stand get the thing out he's talking about somebody drown him and get him out of the thing so he can get the thing out of him we got to get out of our thinking thinking we got got to get out of our I can't make it I'm going to read you this afternoon where brother Brown talks about the right mental attitude he said you've got to believe what you believe you got to literally believe what you're thinking right cuz sometimes we don't believe what we're thinking everybody with me why if it's of God it's got to be positive now there's a perfect way and a permissive way and I feel if the God here on the platform can show me things that's been and my rooms and so forth talking about private interview he's able to tell me just where he wants me and what he wants me to do but I feel as long as I've got it all hooked up another I me I selfish me then he won't put his hand on it as long as I'm doing it and that's the way it is anything as long as you're going to do it if someone talks about you and you talk back about them God can't fight your battle that's right you're fighting at yourself right you don't want the the Bible says the Bible said if somebody speaks against you if you don't speak against them what does it do it heaps coals of fire on top of them it heaps it all back to them but no here we want to do we want to know we want to give them a piece of our what piece of our what oh it's all in the mind if you give them a piece of your soul you want to give them the Holy Ghost now we want to give them a piece of our mind when the guy cuts us off and body sometimes if back in the world you get that one finger wave why because you know what that's what was motivated in you though and and I have an issue with that not shooting birds but I have an issue with people you know not driving right so I got another issue that I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do and I'm going to tell you right now the Lord has corrected me on one thing besides the other 700 this is one so $699 I'm not telling you but this one one I'm going to somebody help sister T in there there you go you how many times have I told y'all I like one kind of cat it's well known a dead one I don't like cats I never have like cats brother brandom even says they had carry Spirits okay but I think I'm going to go get me a cat I ain't even told you in that but the Lord listen y'all think it's funny the Lord has convicted me on that amen you know what brother Bram stood up one day and he called them Ricky and ricettas and all these different things and brother brandham said God took me behind the Woodshed in other words and told me he said you stop that he said those are my people well God said you stop that the other day he said that's my creature that's right right he said that's a part of my economy that's a part of my nature so I probably going to go get a cat what brother R say do if you don't like something do the vice versa ain't that what he said if you want to quit stealing I mean quit um being selfish start giving stuff away Mikey you didn't know I was going to preach on cats today did you the greatest weapon look y'all don't understand what I just said that's Freedom that's Freedom just to change my attitude toward one item it wasn't seals and plagues and vows it was a kitty cat I'm telling you I looked at him as just let's run over that but not anymore I'm oh and y'all don't have nothing y'all just sitting there go wow we need to pray for brother way my Lord him and his cat thing well guess what come up here and tell me what yours is are you too embarrassed huh are you too embarrassed but you know what it's Freedom now you know what that did that bound me yeah you say oh no yeah it does cuz it bothered me and God brought it to my attention none of y'all did cuz you knew how I felt about it but God said hey that's my that's my that in other words that's my animal that's my nature I created that I had a guy tell me the other day we were we're U we work he works in the gainville post office but he lives on my postal route and I told him I said look I said um I've seen so many squirrels have y'all not seen some mean squirrels squirrels on top of squirrels people don't go squirrel hunting anymore so there squirrels everywhere there's one curve down on my route I call it squirrel curve there's probably 50 of them in there and he said I just he said I don't try to dodge them I run over them I try to dodge him I'll wreck that vehicle before I hit a pearl squirrel my attitude versus his he said I just try to run over him with his mail Jeep you know I said well I don't try to run over them I said I try not to hit them but you see that the right mental attitude though you said that don't mean nothing to me well something may mean to you what I just said something you're working with or something you're dealing with just give it to God and look do the vice versa do the opposite boy that's a lot of Revelation well that's what the prophet said am look is a committal to God when you can't do nothing about it just commit it to him and God will take care of it absolutely what's the problem we try to take care of it how many tried to save our kids let us all have a confessional today okay you can't do it you turn them over to God God you know best you know how to get them here you got me here right you got me here in the muck I was in you got me here bring them here so an Army first getting ready for a battle first thing got to be a select some soldiers they got to be dressed for fighting they got to be trained for fighting is what we've been talking about a few minutes ago and I believe it's the greatest battle that was ever fought it's now ready it's now ready to go into action now not 196 what2 no they fought a different battle than me and you 1962 they fought a different battle than me and you fight they're fighting just to stay alive in in the Christian realm you and I are fighting for a body change you and I are fight fighting for going up the statue of perfect man bringing Jesus Christ back to the Earth in me and you that's what we're fighting for amen cuz that's our mandate the greatest battle ever fought is now ready to go into action I believe that God has been selecting his soldiers I believe he's been dressing them training them and the Battlefront is now set getting ready to start when we know where that's at right by the by the title of the sermon the greatest battle ever fought there has to be a place selected there's a mutual ground in no man's land and they fight at that place they just don't one fight over here and one over here and one run over here there's a battle front where they meet and test their powers where each Army test its strength against the other a mutual meeting place now don't miss this when the great battle started on earth now remember he's talking about the battle that started in Heaven There was a battle in heaven first Michael and his angels against the devil and his angels Satan was cast down here now brother R said now the battle's down here that's why I said before Redemption didn't happen in heaven it was formulated in heaven in the mind of God but Redemption happens on the earth cuz something's got to fall that's right all right and we fell so we got to what be redeemed back there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and that battlegr begins in the human mind there is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of battle where it was beginning that is because that decisions are made from the mind the head that's right that's what we'll talk about this afternoon though when you get the right mental attitude and you look at what brother Brown did the the the thing he went through to get to the will of God you understand maybe a little bit more they never started it from some mechanical Affair the grounds never started there therefore that organization can never never do the work of God let me put in there false Doctrine can never do it false Doctrine cannot do it God is not in false Doctrine don't like it and never did he formulate false Doctrine where did false Doctrine come from it didn't come from the listen to me it didn't come from the Holy Ghost in their heart cuz the Holy Ghost can't be wrong that's right where didd it come from right here it came from your mind any Doctrine against the word of God was formulated in some man's mind that's right that's why I said before if you're witnessing to somebody they said oh oh y'all just like y'all live in the Old Testament we live in the New Testament that's a bunch of baloney but we live in both but all you got to do is say look if you got a girl sitting there with a pair of pants on and cutting her hair say who told you you could do that who told you you could wear it was all right for you to wear pants some man had to take cuz the Bible didn't right at least our sisters are trying to live by the Bible and we can go back to the old or new testament either one and say we're trying to live what the Bible says not what some man said cuz remember everything that's false is in your head it's all in your head I mean how many times have people told you that you get this ache and your pain you get this St you get this problem get this thing oh man it's all in your head that's where it starts Eve let Satan into her mind first and she began to what think contrary to the word of God one word not a whole list the problem was is she started preaching hello somebody boy gets quiet when you're talking about women preachers right it started with her preaching the Ser what she should have done she said look I'm the weaker vessel let me go get Adam you know what happened to that Beast he'd went to the far end of the garden amen he wasn't going to challenge Adam but he challenged Eve because of her as we were explaining last Sunday and and I hope y'all enjoyed that I enjoyed answering those questions last Sunday I've got some good comments off of it I hope I've answered the question that you asked right cuz of woman is a weaker vessel that's just I'm sorry that's just the way it is all right but a holy ghost fill woman can teach you something she just can't do it from back here all right but we know that I don't have to preach on women preachers my Heavens but that's where it all got started women preachers she preached a sermon it was wrong that's why brother Brown said God had to what now take a double Covenant the man had to be above the woman she couldn't teach or preach or earth authority in the church the man was the head all right listen when we try to ur up authority over Christ which is our head what happens to us we come out from under the will of God and we're standing out there like Eve naked and alone and here comes the Beast I'll teach you something you've never heard before boy I did I have heard some things I've never heard before I didn't want to hear them again either Aaron right amen but let's don't be selfish and you you think I'm trying to doing this over and over again but a selfish attitude will hurt you it will not it will not in Christianity being selfish is not a part of you shouldn't be a part of you this know also that the last days look last days all right we're in the last days are we not we're in more of the last days and even Timothy writing this in 2 Timothy 3:1 perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own self what caused perilous times they were lovers of their own self all right Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unth thankful Unholy do you know what's going to happen when the squeeze comes and have y'all been reading in the paper how that Biden is trying to change the currency you know I come out with that Bitcoin thing at one time you know but they're coming out with a thing now this is Chip and they can cut your income off or they can add your income here H there'll be a mark brother Brown said you won't be able to buy or sell I wondered how that could happen when I had cash if you put up cash cuz cash is King not when not when it's not backed anymore when it's not backed anymore you come over here and you have to do what the Federal Reserve says and the Federal Reserve says we're not taking $10 bills or $20 bills you got to take what we give you and go to Walmart go to the grocery store it's like I told that brother that was um he was buying gold bars and one ounce of gold is like what now $1,600 something like that I said you got one gold bar I said what you going to do you going to pull up to the gas station and take your knife out and shave off $20 worth of gold now that guy's going to see that and he's going to say your gallon of gas is $1,355 and you going to have to give him a whole bar you're not going to be able to buy a piece off of and hand it to him see what I mean about silly people trying to make it I'm just sorry for that brother cuz you know what he was doing all that stuff for to in case he didn't make a Rapture he can make it through the tribulation boy I don't even want to have anything to do with making it through the tribulation amen I want to get out of here on Eagle wings not worry about it building a bunker right you see the other day where those rich people are taking those old silos that's got the rockets in them and they're building layers and they're buying layers like millions of dollars a piece and that's to make it through a holocaust or make it through a you know disaster give me some Eagle wings give me some feathers give me the feathers of the Holy Ghost and I'll promise you it'll change your life there's no concrete that's going to save you I'll promise you that and there's no gold that's going to save you that's right but he will save those that what get in the word of God get established don't be tossed brother Brown said listen you'll take the mark of the beast and you won't even know it is that correct is that what he said said you'll take the mark and you won't even know it you'll be in that system and you'll not know it till you get in wow see that's your foolish virgin everybody with me I don't know why I'm saying this today but you know what a little bit of life lessons don't hurt anybody so each day I want to live not for myself if I live for myself I live a selfish life I want to live for others and give what strength I have not to myself and to my own pleasure but for the benefit of others that'll build the kingdom of God you know when we talk about in our mind we we we do as human beings do unto others as you have them do unto you don't work oh I I'm sorry I'm sorry today it's me it don't work for me but that's where my war is I know to do I know to do good didn't Paul say that the things I would not I do he Paul wasn't lost during that whole conversation it looks like he was lost and he was saved he was lost and he was saved now he was a prophet writing the Bible he said the things I would not I do the things I do not I would there's a Waring in my members not here here which one I let win Chief white dog black dog but let's don't be selfish cuz you know what when we get to the Statue of perfect man that takes all the selfishness completely out of the picture amen completely out of the picture why did ananas and Safar have to die because they were selfish they did not want to give everything they had to those disciples they wanted to hold back a little bit for theel is that all right brother B said that will continue and be in the end time there'll be analiz and of Fire Spirit com among the church what you're not giving your all and I see it happening now you can't give your half you can't give your third they probably just kept backing up they probably thought they're not going to miss this they're not going to miss it and he got his wife involved and got them both killed and Paul said Peter said you didn't lie to me amen you lied to the Holy Ghost so they were in trouble with the Holy Ghost not with Peter Peter probably in his in his Humanity didn't want to do what he did in his Humanity he didn't want to put the curse on them but you got to think in your mind see there he had to have a mind transformation that it wasn't him they were dealing with it was the Holy Ghost they were lying to not to Peter you can tell you know you can tell me a lie and we can deal with it but don't lie to God do not lie to God cuz you know what he already knows what you what you did before you start lying to our own selfish being to our own ambition that we could completely surrender oursel and be yolked to him no matter what the rest of the world thinks what the rest of the world does we're yolked with the feathers of love we are prisoners my feet is so yolked to Christ it won't dance my eyes are so yolked to Christ amen come on come on somebody tell I when I see these modern strip tees on the street it turns my head my heart is so yolked in love to him till I can't have love for this world anymore my will is so yolked to him till I don't even know what my ambitions are just Wherever You Lead I'll follow Lord I will be a prisoner Paul a prisoner of Christ and everybody knows this quote we have to suffer to rain you think about your life all right just think about your life for a minute and the things you've had to give up since you was a Christian now think about the things you gave up before you were a Christian you hated to give up stuff come on somebody say Amen you hated to give it up you don't want to give this up but when you become a child of God a prisoner to God a prisoner to what the heart it was easy for me to give up drinking smoking cursing easy now you say well wait a minute brother wait it wasn't easy for me yeah but look at you stand here today right folks listen you can't put your battles on me and meme on you and say well you need to work it this way right different to everybody everybody with me all right could you what's the worst thing to do is is you know you work on a situation and and and not just your wife and June doesn't do this but you know if you working on a situation and and your wife walks up and says well my dad wouldn't have handled it that way boy you talking about righteous indignation cuz that Daddy didn't know what we're going through everybody with me we're all different individuals and we're yolked together so we need to work together I'm telling this for a life lesson for all you you need to work together amen listen put the blame on the devil don't put the blame on your spouse put it on the Devil he's the one that started it he's the author of it but you know what God May allowed it for something to happen to what to break your feathers to make you start loving cats when you didn't like them at all I'm serious with that though I'm not trying to play I'm serious and y'all know that I really I just I hated cats I just couldn't stand to look at them but now I'm probably going to get one Jun didn't know this you didn't have a clue because I didn't want to discuss it with her cuz I knew what happen the devil would get involved praise the Lord character building you shouldn't hate the creatures of God now wait a minute when we start talking about rats [Music] roaches um Rebecca snakes she called me one day and I thought she had just absolutely fell out of an airplane I heard the scream sister Rebecca wa it was right after Gary had passed away and I said oh she has done jumped off the jumped off the trailer it was a snake in her bathtub it was a rattlesnake too it was about that long but it was it was big enough to get over the thing if it would have it had got in her house but she was you know how that high voice I said settle down what's going on then she finally said [Music] snake I said okay I'll be there in a minute well I thought it was outside she says come in I thought we're in trouble now go back to that back room and he's got she got a garden tub you know this big I get you call it a garden tub like jacuzzi type Cub tub thank goodness it wasn't shallow but we took care of that snake I didn't turn him loose outside she wouldn't let me she said I want that thing out of here in pieces I do not want them connected together when he leaves this place and I say Amen too but now you see what I mean brother brandham he would shoot animals for people cuz he was a good Hunter you know what God give him a gift let me tell you A Life Lesson here from a prophet right he would shoot animals for people now see that's against the law now there are certain States I want to make it right there are certain States and we'll finish right here I'll pick this up this afternoon we're not even close to memory read and conscious affection but there are certain states that you can buy they call a group tag where you buy one tag for a bear and four people can go and whoever gets the bear first they can use that tag that's not where he was hunting at though and he would go out and shoot animals for him and they would put their tag on it you know what God said stop it hello somebody he didn't get caught by the game warden God called him and said you stop that don't do that no more why because you bring a reproach what if he had got caught everybody with me what if he hadn't got caught by the game warden boy boy a prophet getting caught by the game word no he got caught by God Amen you have to suffer the rain the reason is is character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't Reign what is rain rule over because power apart from character what we were just talking about anything outside of the power of God is of Satan there's only two Powers that's right God's power and Satan's power there's only two and remember His is all knowing all doing all Eternal Satan's is permitted and since he wants to share even his throne well in other words if you have character you fit is fit to rule what Ru what you going to rule over first rule over this first Lord all right but if you rule and what it told us in the Book of Revelations 3 about verse 20s something it says we will what sit in his throne and reign with him in his throne as he overcame and sat with his father in his throne not on in not on in all right and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and sat down on his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him overcome what brother brandom yourself well the devil just bothers me you let him come but didn't go over good you let him cuz I'm going to read to you just this afternoon where brother R says the right mental attitude your mental attitude not your Revelation not your how many times you prayed but your right mental attitude toward any promise of God he'll have to make it come to pass amen amen wow let's read this real quick and then we'll close talking about gifts of God but these gifts of God without these virtues in them makes a stumbling block to the unbeliever look it's not accepted by God he went through all the Pentecostals and they were up shouting speaking in tongu jumping up um you see on the um on the screen the other day he was speaking and somebody spoke in tongues and interpreted it wasn't two sentences later somebody jumped up and spoke in Tong and interpreting he he was gracious to stop but remember he goes over and says all right BR Tabernacle that's don't be kids anymore you take these tongues and gifts and you put them in the back room you do that before the service starts don't do it while the service is going on remember all right but it's not accepted by God this has to be first and when you have faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness brotherly love then the Holy Ghost comes down and seals you as a unit the same as he seals the church ages as a unit the way he makes his bride is the way he makes his individual made out of the same material like Eve was made out of Adam listen there was no denying that's why Adam couldn't destroy Eve amen as we said Sunday Eve didn't sell us out folks Adam sold us out but he was she was so much him she said if if she's done going to die I got to die ain't that what Christ said he took our judgment he said if she's going to die I'm going to die for him but see he could come back and be the Redeemer Adam could not Adam could have love for his wife and and shelter and say God you got to take me didn't know what he did with Moses Ain that what he did with different ones God you got to tell I believe that's what brother brandham did he didn't do it on a on a tape but I believe brother Bram would get along with God he said God God said look I'm going to wiping Pentecostals off said they're they're no good they stopped loving me I'm going to wipe them off I believe brother R said Lord if you take them you got to take me cuz he had the same attitude if you take them you got to take me Paul stood up with those Corinthians he said y'all are whoremongers you remember that whole list of things in Corinthians y'all were all these things and such for some of you but you're washed in other words God didn't give up on you your church a mess didn't give up on you and God's not give up going to give up on you your pastor's not going to give up on you amen here's the things you going to first you can't impersonate them you can't imitate them you've got they've got to be what God sent and God born imitation only causes confusion listen to me imitation only causes confusion we know this is a requirement magicians come this is a requirement if you're going to sit in this building today it's your requirement to live by the word of God it's my requirement to live by the word of God every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Amen and we fall and we fail but guess what there's a provision there when we do there's a provision there called what God forgive me I was caught in the wrong thing I was caught in the wrong trap let's stand to our feet I got caught yesterday day of confessional I guess I was heading home yesterday and brother Chris Long wanted to call wanted me to call him so I did well the truck phone my my phone didn't sink to the truck cuz it June had been driving it yeah Monica get over here we you can see what I'm going to say I'm F to tell something she went so brother John I had to call Chris cuz I told him I said I got I I'll tell you about brother Mike so guess what I did going down the road almost got to rail Georgia and I'm watching to make sure there's no cop cuz you're not supposed to do that and I'm looking down here and I'm driving and I'm talking to brother Chris and all of a sudden I look up in the reer of your mirror Jordan State Patrol and I didn't say where'd
