[0:00] praise the lord
[0:02] god bless you all
[0:04] see that's a good way to get started i
[0:06] am having trouble connecting
[0:08] um so y'all pray for me
[0:12] praise the lord jesus
[0:14] yeah i'm not sure why i'm up here
[0:17] i think i got tricked into it especially
[0:19] when i look out and i see our brother
[0:20] bob out there and
[0:23] you know and certainly brother dale
[0:24] being here my goodness i was tricked
[0:27] so y'all pray for me
[0:29] certainly not a um not a minister for
[0:32] sure so you can lower your expectations
[0:34] to begin with
[0:38] but certainly you know being a christian
[0:40] that certainly means that i have
[0:41] experiences
[0:42] of god changing my life for sure that's
[0:45] number one
[0:46] and certainly life experiences as well
[0:49] you know growing up in this this message
[0:50] has certainly been experiences that i've
[0:52] had and
[0:54] lord just put on my heart to share
[0:56] something related to some of the
[0:57] experiences that i had since i became a
[1:00] christian
[1:01] so i'm certainly honored i don't take it
[1:03] for granted to to be up in front of
[1:06] the bride of christ it's it's a real
[1:08] privilege to to be here standing in
[1:10] front of
[1:10] you and i wanted to take a topic today
[1:13] something that you know we we deal with
[1:15] every time every day something that we
[1:18] all have experience with i am sure
[1:21] something we talk about i'm sure every
[1:23] day something you deal with every day
[1:25] something we talk about and pray about
[1:26] it every service
[1:29] and it's money
[1:31] money
[1:33] so it's very real you work for it you
[1:35] live for it just try to save it you
[1:37] certainly spend it you borrow it you try
[1:39] to invest it
[1:40] you know different languages have
[1:42] different terms that they use moolah
[1:45] doe
[1:46] you can go on and on money so it's a
[1:48] real thing
[1:50] but i want to talk about what financial
[1:51] jubilee
[1:53] and um you know what jubilee if you look
[1:56] at the the hebrew word for jubilee we
[1:58] know that it's freedom we know that as a
[2:01] celebration a time of jubilee
[2:04] but you believe really the hebrew word
[2:06] for that is the trumpet the rams horn
[2:08] that was used to announce the jubilee
[2:12] so that jubilee is really a trumpet
[2:14] and there's a quote from brother breton
[2:16] he says when the trumpet sounded every
[2:17] man could go free if he wanted to go
[2:21] free it was a choice that you had to
[2:24] make if you wanted to go free
[2:26] and that's very very important because
[2:28] that choice comes down to us and you
[2:30] would ask why would someone not want to
[2:31] go free i mean that seems very easy if i
[2:33] said you can go free say i want to go
[2:34] free but freedom comes with a cost
[2:38] so slavery if you think about slavery at
[2:41] those times why would someone not want
[2:42] to go free well it's work it's hard it's
[2:45] difficult we get used to certain things
[2:48] we get comfortable
[2:49] so financially we can be comfortable in
[2:51] our current society where it's based on
[2:53] you borrow you go in debt you you do
[2:55] what you have to do really to get by
[2:57] but you get satisfied you get used to it
[3:00] as the norm it just becomes standard
[3:02] this is the way we live
[3:05] but when that trumpet sounds you can go
[3:06] free if you want to go free but it's
[3:08] work it's hard it's difficult but
[3:10] there's freedom
[3:12] and that's what financial jubilee is all
[3:14] about
[3:15] how did i even get to this topic well
[3:17] i've had some experiences in my life
[3:19] when god got a hold of me my parents my
[3:21] dad many of you certainly the older ones
[3:23] know my dad we come from a poor
[3:25] background
[3:26] my dad was an extremely hard worker
[3:30] period i know brother gary who worked
[3:32] with my dad early on no one could
[3:33] outwork my dad it was impossible he
[3:36] still works today so he's 83 years old
[3:39] he's still going you can't stop him he
[3:42] drives from he from hartwell georgia to
[3:44] macon they go he go to the service down
[3:46] and make it he's still doing that so
[3:48] sunday's up i'm going four hours away
[3:50] he's driving
[3:52] so my dad is a hard worker but
[3:53] financially we struggled i remember
[3:56] 375 was our monthly rent and my dad had
[3:59] a hard time sometimes coming up with
[4:01] that
[4:02] of course he worked he paid the people
[4:04] that worked with him but he didn't
[4:05] really manage any of that so the money
[4:07] would come in it would go out
[4:10] god in his grace allowed me to go to
[4:11] college
[4:12] that was a whole testimony of itself in
[4:14] maryland
[4:16] got out of college and i thought i was
[4:18] smart
[4:19] man i thought i was really smart i was
[4:21] making some money that my dad had never
[4:23] seen that type of money before and my
[4:25] brother was doing the same thing making
[4:26] some real money we was like wow so we
[4:29] got into real estate him and i started
[4:31] looking at houses we knew some other
[4:33] brothers that were
[4:34] borrowing money to buy houses and rehab
[4:36] them and sell them so we started doing
[4:38] all of that
[4:40] and i sold we sold one house and we made
[4:43] some good money i thought oh my i'm a
[4:45] christian this is how god is going to
[4:46] bless me
[4:48] i'm going to be blessed
[4:51] was i in for a surprise
[4:54] 2007 2008 you all know what happened if
[4:56] it was in any type of real estate it
[4:58] went
[4:59] money started going out left and right
[5:02] we started losing everything that we
[5:04] thought we ever had
[5:06] we lost a whole lot of money to say the
[5:09] least
[5:10] so i was shocked into this it got so bad
[5:14] thousands 10 20 000 gone gone gone every
[5:17] day the market was going like this
[5:19] we got down to one property that we had
[5:21] to try to get rid of
[5:23] and this was a condo in this condo they
[5:26] had a huge electric panel where the
[5:29] electric uh
[5:31] meter goes in
[5:33] so we got our condo was all ready to
[5:35] sell we're going to be done by god's
[5:37] grace we're going to get out of it
[5:40] call the electric electrician to come
[5:42] out to put the electric meter in
[5:44] they came out and said it's broke
[5:46] there's a plastic piece inside the meter
[5:47] and they can't get it in
[5:49] i said oh okay well they said you need
[5:51] to call the homeowners association to
[5:53] get this worked on we called
[5:56] they came out to know you got to get the
[5:57] entire thing replaced not just your box
[6:00] because it's connected to all of the
[6:02] condos this is going to be about ten
[6:03] thousand dollars for you to fix i'm like
[6:06] oh my god lord what in the world is
[6:09] going on here
[6:11] my brother who is in construction as
[6:12] well he said john whatever you do
[6:14] don't bother that electric panel
[6:17] it can boom that could be it
[6:21] i'm like i hear you i understand
[6:23] but i was under intense stress
[6:26] so i went and looked at that panel and
[6:27] it truly was a little small plastic
[6:29] piece that was broke
[6:32] and i was like if i could just move that
[6:33] plastic piece out of the way
[6:35] it'll be fine
[6:37] so i can do it i mean i'm pretty steady
[6:40] just have my screwdriver some rubber
[6:42] shoes on i'm fine i can i can
[6:46] get this plastic piece and get this 10
[6:48] 000 out of the way
[6:51] i don't know what happened
[6:53] i don't know how steady i was
[6:55] but i touched that thing boom
[7:00] all i know
[7:01] i was probably about 10 feet back by the
[7:03] time i came to and a chunk of that medal
[7:06] had been blown off
[7:09] i don't know what happened
[7:10] but i know god and his grace spared my
[7:12] life i do know that
[7:15] of course i didn't touch it after that
[7:16] believe me i
[7:17] i didn't touch it and i knew it was the
[7:20] grace of god because we called another
[7:21] electrician they came out
[7:24] called me later and said hey
[7:26] we fixed it
[7:27] that's all they said i said well okay
[7:29] how much
[7:30] to don't worry about it we've never seen
[7:33] anything like that that's all they said
[7:36] i said okay praise god
[7:39] but i went home and i started praying i
[7:40] said lord god something's wrong i've
[7:42] been paying my tithes i've been doing
[7:44] what i know to be right i've always been
[7:46] a little tried to manage my money the
[7:47] best that i could
[7:49] but lord something's not right
[7:51] that's when god started saying yep
[7:53] you've been trying to do it your way the
[7:55] world's way you've been a slave god has
[7:57] a way to manage money and it's called
[8:00] god's way
[8:01] let's go to the next slide
[8:06] and when you talk about money certainly
[8:09] it's not just money and that's what i've
[8:11] come to realize you know god
[8:13] in his word you can read plenty of
[8:15] scriptures about it you can also go
[8:17] through the message and see it but he
[8:18] said if you therefore have not been
[8:21] faithful in the unrighteous mammon which
[8:23] is worldly wealth
[8:24] who will commit to your trust the true
[8:27] riches that's luke 16 1.
[8:30] that's what it's all about it's about
[8:32] managing something that's
[8:34] we all know we can all relate to
[8:36] but god is trying to see how well we can
[8:38] do that to put us in a position to
[8:40] manage true true riches and i know we
[8:44] know all what that's about
[8:46] all of the true riches to be able to
[8:48] manage that with character and that's
[8:50] what he's trying to get it is something
[8:52] that anybody from the youngest age can
[8:54] relate to money how do you manage it you
[8:56] can look at your children how do they
[8:58] spin how do they save do they have any
[9:00] character to save anything
[9:02] or do they always spend do they borrow
[9:05] are they just used to the norm so that's
[9:08] what financial jubilee is about it's
[9:10] about bringing that out go to the next
[9:12] slide
[9:12] [Applause]
[9:14] if you look at our society so 80 percent
[9:16] of americans have some form of consumer
[9:18] debt that's an average of 38 000
[9:21] of americans which we supposed to be the
[9:23] richest nation on earth but 80
[9:27] so if we brought 10 people up here
[9:29] eight of you could sit down you got some
[9:31] level of debt
[9:33] two of you would be a little special
[9:37] 70 percent of lottery winners spend it
[9:40] dave ramsey said that
[9:42] 78 of former nfl players have gone
[9:45] bankrupt or in financial distress due to
[9:48] joblessness or divorce that's from their
[9:50] own magazine sports illustrated
[9:53] so it's very real it's not about
[9:55] how much money you have
[9:57] or how little but it's how you manage
[10:00] what god has given you
[10:02] let's go to the next slide
[10:04] it's the number one reason for arguments
[10:06] among couples the number one reason for
[10:08] divorce
[10:09] the love of it as we know is the root of
[10:11] all evil clearly stated you can serve it
[10:13] or god that's how real it is
[10:16] keep going go to the next brothers
[10:20] if we talk about our uncle who we know
[10:22] who that is that's uncle sam right
[10:25] so looking at 2020.
[10:28] so
[10:29] as a country we brought in everybody
[10:31] when you pay your taxes that's how the
[10:32] government gets all of their money
[10:34] they brought in about 3.6 trillion
[10:37] dollars they spent or promised to pay
[10:40] about 13.4 trillion
[10:42] so they overspent 9.8 trillion dollars
[10:46] in 2020. we know with the pandemic all
[10:49] the money going out the little pieces
[10:51] that you got well that was part of that
[10:53] 9.8 trillion that they just gave you
[10:55] over and beyond what they had
[10:58] so we already know what our prophet said
[10:59] about this nation that it is bankrupt if
[11:02] you look at the full outstanding bills
[11:04] of the of our government it's 123
[11:07] trillion dollars
[11:09] that's about 796 000 per person
[11:13] if we had to all pay that back that's
[11:15] how much it would be so if you got that
[11:17] in your wallet you can write your check
[11:18] and you can be free
[11:21] it's 123 trillion 123 trillion trillion
[11:26] is a big number in and of itself like if
[11:29] i tried to tell you what a trillion
[11:30] looks like it's very hard to imagine
[11:32] but if i were to take a million dollars
[11:35] and i'm gonna give you 10 million
[11:36] dollars
[11:38] tell me how long you think you could
[11:39] spend it to reach 1 trillion you
[11:42] probably well maybe a year if you're
[11:43] trying to do your math no it'll be
[11:46] past 100 years
[11:48] past 200 years you mean you can spend 10
[11:51] million dollars a day for over 200 years
[11:53] and you still haven't reached a trillion
[11:56] try
[11:57] 273 years to spend 10 million dollars a
[12:00] day
[12:01] you couldn't spend a trillion
[12:04] don't mind
[12:05] so think about what our profit is saying
[12:08] who's going to pay that
[12:09] who's going to even help
[12:12] i think you already know i know y'all
[12:14] have been taught well because i've been
[12:15] here for several years
[12:17] so rome is going to help solve this
[12:19] problem
[12:21] my my mind and brother burnham said
[12:23] right in the money will get this whole
[12:26] thing rolling
[12:27] so where do you think we're headed
[12:29] so my we definitely want to be free
[12:31] people by his grace
[12:33] go to the next slide
[12:36] so we always talk about the government
[12:38] right and we're like oh man that's bad
[12:40] that's all man
[12:42] that's terrible
[12:43] this quote says if god gives us things
[12:45] to do and gives us money and makes us
[12:48] the richest nation under the heaven
[12:50] then god's going to ask what did we do
[12:53] with it
[12:54] why do we spend our money for things
[12:55] that satisfy not not only a nation
[12:59] but that'll be to individuals
[13:03] that's each one of us my brothers and
[13:04] sisters each one of us has to manage
[13:07] what god gives us in a way that it's
[13:09] different from the world the only way
[13:12] you can do that is god's way that's the
[13:14] only way to do this
[13:16] go to the next
[13:19] so we got to talk about financial
[13:21] bondage because before god helped me i i
[13:23] didn't know i thought i was like i said
[13:25] i thought i was smart i thought i had
[13:27] figured it out i thought god was going
[13:29] to bless me richly
[13:31] and it wasn't until god started showing
[13:33] me no you were way off
[13:35] so the question you got to ask yourself
[13:37] am i free or am i comfortable with this
[13:41] what this world and america has created
[13:44] me
[13:44] am i in financial bondage i don't know
[13:47] if you went to the doctors you got to do
[13:50] some check-ups some physical they got to
[13:51] tell you what kind of condition you are
[13:54] so we're going to run through some
[13:56] quick symptoms to see if you fit into
[13:59] any of this
[14:00] let's go to the first next slide all
[14:02] right we're going to run through some of
[14:03] this
[14:04] number one or you're always worried
[14:06] about money
[14:07] okay
[14:08] that's money and marriage problems
[14:11] arguments in the home frustrations maybe
[14:13] too much
[14:15] month at the end of the money the money
[14:17] the money runs out and you still got a
[14:19] long way to go
[14:21] is that going on in your home
[14:23] number two this is what i call bailout
[14:26] this is the big one
[14:27] especially now more than ever it's like
[14:30] you can go to youtube and find a
[14:32] thousand ways to make ten thousand
[14:34] dollars next month
[14:36] is not going to happen let me tell you
[14:39] but
[14:40] are you looking for some kind of bailout
[14:42] you know what i mean you're ignoring
[14:43] reality you got problems with money
[14:46] you're in debt you've got situations
[14:47] that you know you need to handle but
[14:49] you're hoping for a bailout something's
[14:51] going to happen
[14:53] okay something's going to happen is
[14:54] going to take care of all of this
[14:55] problems
[14:57] you want different results but you
[14:58] haven't changed anything
[15:00] and you look at history i mean we're at
[15:02] the end right we're at the end of time
[15:05] you know we know that
[15:07] we should be a people that should be
[15:09] free
[15:10] free from religious bondage free from
[15:12] all of those things that history has
[15:14] stacked us
[15:15] to this point
[15:17] we know the scripture that's always used
[15:18] in this church that they without us
[15:20] cannot be made perfect
[15:22] you know and the end of times have come
[15:24] to us but have we learned i mean have we
[15:27] learned from everything all of history i
[15:29] think of our prophet and what he brought
[15:32] everything has advanced everything has
[15:34] advanced but it seems like
[15:37] and i'm not saying this to be
[15:39] maybe for myself
[15:41] we should be way up the road
[15:43] with everything because we should be
[15:45] getting ready to go
[15:47] everything
[15:48] but take your money are we ready to go
[15:51] are you clean is it
[15:52] is it polished that you are really
[15:54] standing ready to go
[15:56] if god were to say let's go or do we
[15:58] have outstanding bills and debts and
[15:59] we're in a mess
[16:01] are we
[16:02] because if we're really ready to go we
[16:04] have to be ready to go in all areas of
[16:06] our life
[16:07] and i truly believe that's what god is
[16:09] doing to us trying to prepare us for
[16:10] that
[16:11] number two so is it is it we're looking
[16:13] for a bailout we're looking for
[16:14] something different every get rich quick
[16:17] or hey this opportunity is going to
[16:19] solve all my problems this will take
[16:20] care of it well that's how i kind of
[16:22] start started i thought god was going to
[16:24] bless me and it's going to be
[16:26] i'm going to show i'm a christian he did
[16:28] the opposite
[16:30] so that's the bailout if you have those
[16:33] kind of thoughts you're looking for some
[16:34] easy way
[16:37] that's the bailout the next is cover-up
[16:39] this is postponing the issue
[16:41] this is not being truthful with your
[16:43] spouse your husband wife you may know
[16:45] situations in your family that hey
[16:47] you're not telling your spouse if you're
[16:49] young and you're dating that's a good
[16:51] topic to kind of get through make sure
[16:53] she's not going to bring some some bills
[16:55] with her or he's not going to bring some
[16:56] bills with him make sure you understand
[16:58] that
[16:59] those are things to talk about
[17:02] but you can go through life your whole
[17:03] journey and not share things with your
[17:05] spouse because it's kind of embarrassing
[17:07] yeah i never paid this off i never paid
[17:09] that off
[17:10] but what you're waiting for
[17:12] if god were to take you home you don't
[17:14] that left on your spouse
[17:17] something she has to deal with i've seen
[17:18] that i've experienced that
[17:22] young and old alike i've seen that in
[17:24] the church
[17:25] i've seen that
[17:27] so it's very very real so don't have any
[17:30] cover-up situations
[17:32] not truthful to your family friends
[17:35] digging the hole deeper to maintain an
[17:36] image
[17:37] that's all about cover-up the next is
[17:40] greed this is certainly something that
[17:42] you feel like well i deserve it it
[17:43] should be me
[17:45] you know how do they get that you're not
[17:47] content
[17:48] impulse buying you buy things on impulse
[17:50] don't talk about it
[17:52] you know hey that's that's got a little
[17:53] bit of greed
[17:55] next is resentment you know point in the
[17:58] finger feel like god not giving you what
[18:00] you want and you're envious of others
[18:03] around financial concerns and money and
[18:05] things
[18:06] indulgence creating happy moments
[18:10] you know you can't afford it so you buy
[18:12] more
[18:14] that's called a great escape you know
[18:16] it's time to take a vacation when you
[18:17] start thinking about money like you know
[18:19] what we got to go
[18:20] yeah we need a vacation we need some
[18:22] happy experiences i know this one for
[18:24] sure when i started losing that money
[18:26] that money was going down like
[18:28] i could watch it especially being an
[18:30] accountant i was literally watching it
[18:32] go down but guess what
[18:34] part of that time i went out and test
[18:36] drive the new suv
[18:38] and i thought hey it's bad but i'm about
[18:40] to feel good and i drove that car around
[18:43] i was like man
[18:45] about his grace guys like no you don't
[18:47] need it you need to deal with the
[18:48] problem
[18:49] but it felt good i thought man if i
[18:51] could get this it'll kind of make me
[18:52] feel better for all this money that i
[18:54] lost and i didn't have any money to buy
[18:56] it but i guarantee you
[18:58] the world will tell you you deserve it
[19:00] john you've been working hard buddy
[19:01] you've been working hard you've been a
[19:02] faithful tied pair you can you can get
[19:05] this
[19:06] just sign these loan documents you can
[19:07] get it then god will bless you
[19:09] i don't sound like god blesses me it
[19:11] sounds like visa or mastercard or that
[19:13] bank is blessing me
[19:14] but that's what we call indulgence the
[19:16] next one is called no plan
[19:19] you don't know what happened right you
[19:20] know that you know that situation every
[19:22] month
[19:23] you know what's bills should be due
[19:26] but you don't know what happened so
[19:28] you're coming can i borrow this can i
[19:29] borrow that i don't know what happened
[19:32] well i know what happened you had some
[19:33] bills and you didn't have money you
[19:34] didn't work you didn't save you didn't
[19:35] put it aside
[19:36] guarantee your property tax gas all
[19:38] that's going to come those bills are
[19:40] going to keep coming
[19:42] so you need to keep some good records
[19:44] don't be slothful have a plan
[19:47] number eight middle man this is living
[19:49] paycheck by paycheck there's no margin
[19:51] all that comes in goes out
[19:55] during the pandemic we know i mean
[19:57] credit card you people was using that to
[19:59] make end meets i mean it was no kind of
[20:01] security if our government as you saw
[20:04] they had a plan we wouldn't have spent
[20:06] 9.8 trillion over but there was no plan
[20:08] there was nothing set aside to be
[20:10] prepared for that
[20:11] but we want to make sure within our home
[20:13] we don't have that
[20:14] nine is help wanted
[20:16] this has been unable to help when the
[20:18] real need arise your kids your parents i
[20:20] like to call this one like the hate the
[20:22] broke good samaritan if that good
[20:23] samaritan was broke that bible story
[20:25] would be very different promise you he
[20:27] would not have sent that man to that
[20:28] hotel it would not have happened he'd
[20:30] been like looking at him like
[20:32] bruh i can't take you home and i
[20:35] i can't
[20:37] man good luck
[20:40] but the bible store is quite different
[20:42] than that he had something he had
[20:44] something to say hey leave him here
[20:46] whatever he i'll take care of it when i
[20:49] get back
[20:50] and i promise you he didn't have to go
[20:51] to visa or mastercard to take care of
[20:53] that so we want to make sure that we're
[20:55] in a position where we can help truly
[20:57] then we know the depth debt trap you
[20:59] know this is not saving this is not bar
[21:01] and this is borrowing
[21:03] and being in that trap
[21:05] all right real quick so those are
[21:07] symptoms you can think about that let's
[21:10] go to the next slide
[21:12] the only way to get out of all of this
[21:14] right you got to have some principles
[21:15] and standards i'd like to call it a gps
[21:17] if you're kind of lost with all of this
[21:18] how do we figure it out well god has
[21:21] some principles he has some standards
[21:23] that can help guide you
[21:25] and that's what you have to take his
[21:26] word to guide you through all of this he
[21:28] knows exactly where each one of you are
[21:31] just like a gps and he can direct you
[21:34] all to that one way
[21:36] and get you back on that path that you
[21:38] have to be on
[21:40] all right go to the next slide we'll run
[21:41] through this
[21:43] for example this is one of the things
[21:45] prepare thy work if you look at the
[21:46] scriptures and this is certainly for
[21:48] some of the young people coming up
[21:50] how well that word guides us it says
[21:52] prepare thy work without and make ready
[21:54] for it in the field and afterwards build
[21:56] your house so before you run down and
[21:58] you get married make sure you have a
[22:01] plan
[22:02] make sure you have a way to provide
[22:05] then you start building your house don't
[22:07] take that first step you don't know if
[22:09] that young lady is going to want a coach
[22:11] bag a versace or whatever they call it
[22:13] all this stuff hey you better make sure
[22:16] you can take care of her
[22:18] likewise
[22:19] make sure sister that you're prepared
[22:22] for your husband make sure you don't
[22:23] have a bass boat five guns and all this
[22:25] and he's thinking he's gonna have what
[22:26] his granddaddy had tomorrow
[22:29] you better make sure because you're
[22:30] gonna find yourself in a lot of trouble
[22:33] so you can see how easy and how well our
[22:35] word is designed to guide us in whatever
[22:38] phase of life that we are in we're going
[22:40] to run through in the next couple
[22:41] minutes just some of the principles
[22:44] principle number one always know god
[22:46] owns it all the 10 tides they're his and
[22:49] the 90
[22:50] we pay our tithes and we think well the
[22:52] 90 i guess i can do whatever i want to
[22:54] no he just gave that to you for you to
[22:56] manage and trusted it to you but it's
[22:59] still his so we don't waste our money
[23:02] we're wasting his money
[23:04] so it's important to think about how
[23:05] you're spending your money and know that
[23:07] god owns it all principle two
[23:10] manage his resources diligently get
[23:12] organized the scripture says the hand of
[23:15] the diligent shall bear rule but the
[23:17] slothful shall be under tribute
[23:20] get organized write some things down
[23:23] that's all you it doesn't have to be
[23:25] fancy but write some things down
[23:27] try to get organized take baby steps one
[23:30] step at a time
[23:33] money is time you purchase stuff with
[23:36] your time
[23:37] don't swap any portion of your a lot of
[23:38] time on earth for useless stuff you can
[23:41] pay 25 an hour if you waste that money
[23:43] that's 25 that's an hour of your time
[23:45] that you just
[23:46] said it was nothing so it's time to
[23:48] think about it think about what am i
[23:50] doing you know if your kids are wasting
[23:52] whatever is going on think about what
[23:53] you're doing because that is your life
[23:55] that you're trading
[23:56] and the world has been designed that way
[23:58] you work and you get paid
[24:00] so it's your time you got to think about
[24:02] that
[24:03] number four delayed gratification is one
[24:05] of the keys to financial maturity
[24:08] okay
[24:10] it says learning to wait that is so
[24:13] important learning to wait
[24:15] simply don't spend more than you earn
[24:17] wait it's so much character
[24:20] into waiting saving building i promise
[24:24] you you buy a car brand new for fifty
[24:26] thousand dollars
[24:28] it's easy to sign that loan promise you
[24:31] you save 50 000 you'll be a different
[24:33] person you will definitely think about
[24:35] before you spend that money i know for a
[24:37] fact we bought a in maryland before god
[24:40] taught me these principles we had a
[24:41] 40-year loan on a house and i know they
[24:44] got next generation loans you can pass
[24:46] through your kids if you want
[24:48] 40-year loan and i remember going in the
[24:50] house we had a house built
[24:52] we walked in they didn't do some things
[24:54] right but we were so
[24:56] thrilled to borrow that we couldn't tell
[24:59] them we felt well we've been blessed
[25:01] with this loan we can't disturb some
[25:03] situations you know we
[25:05] uh we'll take it
[25:06] but if i had that money i promise you
[25:08] i've been like no you're going to fix
[25:09] that
[25:10] or we're not buying the house we'll take
[25:12] our thousands of dollars somewhere else
[25:15] so you can see what debt does it puts
[25:17] you into a different frame of mind
[25:20] go to the next slide
[25:22] principle five
[25:23] winter is coming
[25:26] i'm sorry it says avoid debt like the
[25:27] curse the wealth tells us
[25:29] that we deserve to have it but as a
[25:31] christian we don't deserve debt oh i
[25:33] love this scripture it says the blessing
[25:35] of the lord it maketh rich and he added
[25:37] no sorrow with it man that's how you
[25:40] want to be blessed you don't want to be
[25:42] blessed and now you have some headaches
[25:44] trying to pay back some bills
[25:46] that's not the way god wants to bless
[25:48] you
[25:50] amen
[25:51] principle six winter is coming save a
[25:53] little bit don't spend all that comes in
[25:56] don't live to the max we already know
[25:58] the scripture that's been thousands and
[26:00] thousands of years go to the ant
[26:02] go to the end
[26:04] you're not going to be the same man 20
[26:06] years from now that you are today my dad
[26:08] although he works hard he's definitely
[26:09] not the same man that he was when he was
[26:12] 50. at brother uh our brother ray's
[26:15] funeral my dad was talking to me he was
[26:16] like um
[26:18] god he said i wish i was that young man
[26:20] that i used to be
[26:21] my dad don't talk much but somehow he
[26:24] was reflecting on that at our brother's
[26:26] funeral he said man i could really go
[26:29] out there and do a lot i was like dad
[26:30] you're absolutely right you did that and
[26:32] probably to you like 60 or 70.
[26:34] but now he knows that he's just not that
[26:36] same i wish i had my strength so that's
[26:38] what we got to look at we don't know how
[26:40] long we're going to be here but it's
[26:42] still trying to think through like okay
[26:44] i can't
[26:44] live to the max
[26:46] i have to put something away
[26:48] just in case god still has me here or my
[26:50] spouse years from now
[26:56] principle seven the best investment of
[26:58] course is given to the kingdom of god
[27:00] your a lot of returns is waiting for you
[27:01] at home
[27:02] we know that and of course the last
[27:05] contentment is learned so everything i'm
[27:08] talking about is you have to practice
[27:10] just like the statue of a perfect man
[27:11] it's something that you got to walk you
[27:13] got to do it every day until that
[27:14] character is built inside of you paul
[27:17] said and get contentment is not
[27:18] something i can give you but if you
[27:20] apply these principles it's something
[27:22] that you can learn paul said i know how
[27:24] to be a bound and i know how to a base
[27:26] he learned by the grace of god so that's
[27:29] something we could do let's go to the
[27:30] next slide as we finish up
[27:34] this quote really means a lot and this
[27:35] was something that really stood out to
[27:36] me when when god was dealing with me
[27:38] during these times for sure you know
[27:40] this quote i promise to clean up your
[27:42] lives pay your debts
[27:44] oh no man jesus said get all things off
[27:47] your hands get everything right make
[27:49] ready get ready remember in the name of
[27:51] the lord something is fixing to happen
[27:55] that's what these principles all about
[27:56] it's about cleaning your lives getting
[27:58] things ready
[28:00] you know not owing anyone
[28:02] getting yourselves diligent writing
[28:04] things down and just the way that you do
[28:07] write it down take envelopes whatever
[28:09] you have to do to get yourselves
[28:10] organized to talk to people that you may
[28:13] owe money on just get yourself cleaned
[28:14] up god is there to help i know from
[28:17] experience because we started applying
[28:19] these principles
[28:21] step by step step by step we started
[28:23] getting rid of things that we didn't
[28:24] need we started selling things we
[28:25] started doing everything that we could
[28:26] do to get ourselves out of that hole i
[28:29] didn't take any shortcuts and by not
[28:31] taking any shortcuts god showed me his
[28:33] way and i have proved it i have proved
[28:35] it beyond a shadow of a doubt what god
[28:38] can do when you start applying his
[28:41] principles he's there to help he wants
[28:43] to get our lives ready that's his goal
[28:46] that's what he wants to do and he wants
[28:47] us to be free from this bondage for this
[28:50] world we shouldn't look like the world
[28:52] we know that but our finances our homes
[28:55] all of that should also not look like
[28:57] the world
[28:58] and the only way to do that is with that
[29:00] gps god's principles and standards
[29:03] last slide as we close and the musicians
[29:05] can get ready to come up
[29:07] go to click brothers
[29:09] you can go to the next
[29:11] that's what we're trying to strive for
[29:12] says well done good and faithful servant
[29:14] thou has been faithful
[29:16] over a few things i will make you ruler
[29:18] of many things enter thou into the joy
[29:21] of the lord that's very real that's what
[29:23] our god is trying to prepare us for to
[29:26] get us to be that faithful servant
[29:28] of course money is a little thing but
[29:30] being faithful
[29:31] faithful with that little thing is a
[29:33] very very big thing so god bless you all
[29:37] certainly appreciate this opportunity
[29:39] and the musicians all can come on up
[29:42] [Applause]
