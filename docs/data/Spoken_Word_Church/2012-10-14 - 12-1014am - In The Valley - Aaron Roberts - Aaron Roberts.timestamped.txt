[10:33] we commit all of these things
[10:35] in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[10:39] amen
[10:42] first Samuel chapter 17.
[10:51] very familiar
[10:56] verse first Samus
[10:59] chapter 17 verse 1 says now the fullest
[11:01] things gathered together the armies to
[11:03] battle and were gathered together
[11:07] at Sugar which belongeth to Judah
[11:10] appears to get shoka
[11:13] and a Zia
[11:15] and Fs denim
[11:17] and soul and the men of Israel were
[11:18] gathered together and pitched by the
[11:20] valley of elah and set the battle in a
[11:22] ring against the Philistines and the
[11:25] Philistine stood on the mountain on one
[11:26] side and Israel stood on the mountain on
[11:29] the other side and there was a valley
[11:31] between them and they went out a
[11:33] champion out of the camp of the
[11:35] Philistines named Goliath of gath whose
[11:38] height was six cubits and a span and he
[11:41] had a helmet of brass upon his head and
[11:44] he was armed with a coat of mail and the
[11:46] weight of the coat was 500 shekels of
[11:49] brass and he had Graves of brass upon
[11:51] his legs and a target of brass upon his
[11:53] shoulders and the staff of his spear was
[11:56] like a Weaver's bean and his Spears had
[11:59] weighed 600 shekels of iron and one
[12:02] bearing a shield went before him
[12:05] and he stood and cried under the armies
[12:07] of Israel and said unto them why are ye
[12:09] come out to set your battle an array am
[12:12] I not a Philistine and ye servants to
[12:14] Saul Choose You amen
[12:17] for you and let him come down to me if
[12:20] he'd be able to fight with me and to
[12:22] kill me then we will be your servants
[12:25] but if I Prevail against him and kill
[12:27] him then ye shall be our servants and
[12:30] serve Us in the Philistine said I defy
[12:32] the armies of Israel this day give me a
[12:34] man that we may be we may fight together
[12:39] amen Lord and the blessing in reading
[12:41] the word and be seated this morning
[12:49] and I want to
[12:51] take a little thought this morning about
[12:53] being in the valley
[12:57] and
[12:59] been
[13:01] on the been on my mind a while I've been
[13:04] doing some reading and
[13:08] you know we all like to be on the
[13:11] Mountaintop
[13:12] you know it's you know that's you know
[13:15] what we always like to be in the victory
[13:19] you know we always
[13:21] you know the Bible's full of Mountaintop
[13:23] experience oh yeah
[13:25] you know we think about Mount
[13:27] Transfiguration
[13:29] and when we talk about the the
[13:31] Abraham
[13:34] and Isaac going up on the mountain
[13:37] meeting God and God being showing that
[13:39] he was Jehovah Jireh
[13:41] because he brought the brought forth the
[13:43] lamb
[13:45] you know Moses was on Mount Sinai
[13:48] when God gave him the Commandments and
[13:51] then you know he was home he was on
[13:52] Mount Sinai when he asked God he said
[13:54] can I see your face and he said no man
[13:56] can see my face and live exactly right
[13:59] but he said you stand in the Cliff of
[14:00] The Rock
[14:01] and he said I'll put my hand over your
[14:03] face and he said you'll come I'll walk
[14:05] past and you can see my behind you know
[14:07] my back part
[14:09] and he sold you know he saw a man come
[14:11] back
[14:13] and you know we think about
[14:17] oh
[14:19] Moses
[14:21] Moses was on the mountain
[14:23] when the children of Israel was fighting
[14:25] amalek right
[14:27] right and it was as the battle Rags you
[14:29] know Moses sitting on the mountain there
[14:32] on the hill and he told him he said I'm
[14:34] gonna hold up my hands on my rod and and
[14:36] he said you know the battle went for
[14:38] Israel while they had his hands up yeah
[14:40] but he said when his arms got tired you
[14:42] know Aaron and her had to come and hold
[14:44] his arms up so they could defeat him a
[14:46] lick
[14:47] and you know Calvary
[14:50] was another was another battle that was
[14:53] fought where the victory was won
[14:55] you know we we look and we won't talk of
[14:57] the mountaintops
[14:59] but you know if the same things go for
[15:01] the things that are in the valleys
[15:04] right and you know the scripture
[15:07] Psalms 121 1 says I will lift up my eyes
[15:11] into the heels for when it's cometh my
[15:13] help
[15:14] from the Lord which made heaven and
[15:17] earth right and then in Psalms 125 1
[15:22] David writing says they that trust in
[15:24] the Lord shall be as Mount Zion
[15:27] which cannot be removed but abide that's
[15:30] forever right so again we always like to
[15:32] think about the things that happen on
[15:33] the mountain
[15:35] but you know what I want to talk about
[15:36] the things that happen that have
[15:38] happened
[15:40] because brother Branham says here and
[15:42] getting in the spirit he says well you
[15:44] know it's all right to be on the
[15:45] Mountaintop that's good but let me tell
[15:47] you he said your fruits will freeze up
[15:49] there at night
[15:51] and when the cold spell comes you'll
[15:53] lose all your fruit they said that's
[15:56] what's happened now
[15:57] we put too much on mountaintop
[15:59] experiences a dancing is shaking and
[16:01] jumping around instead of all night
[16:03] prayer meetings right down in the valley
[16:05] of decision
[16:06] where you have to come down there and
[16:08] meet God and really pour out your life
[16:11] until something takes place right
[16:14] and then moving on he says what we need
[16:17] is to get down to that grinding place
[16:19] right down there in that Valley dig out
[16:22] that's exactly right it's where the
[16:24] church needs to be tonight amen right so
[16:28] that's where we need to be because
[16:29] brother Brenham all continuing on in the
[16:31] same message he said that's what's the
[16:34] matter today with too many people's
[16:36] experience he said two dry and stiff
[16:40] we need something flexible the wind
[16:43] comes down it blows and rushes and rush
[16:44] it around
[16:45] and pull it around and make it grow get
[16:49] life into it
[16:51] because you know
[16:53] and if you've been in if you've been
[16:54] anywhere especially you go in the
[16:56] mountains
[16:58] water's not in the mountain
[17:00] the water's rolling downhill right
[17:03] and so as the water runs down here
[17:04] that's what he's talking about he said
[17:05] because brother Brandon says he'd rather
[17:08] be a little bit green
[17:10] right because he could move right
[17:12] exactly because that's where that's
[17:14] where the water was at right and he says
[17:16] because because everybody trying to live
[17:19] on the Mountaintop
[17:21] he said God off without God
[17:24] what we need today is get back to God
[17:26] get back to the experience right get
[17:28] back right
[17:31] you know I thought that was really
[17:32] amazing because we want to live on the
[17:33] Mountaintop but that's not where God
[17:34] wants us to be right we have a
[17:36] Mountaintop experience but you know what
[17:38] God has other places for us to be right
[17:42] brethren
[17:43] Davis uh talking
[17:47] because you know they said persecution
[17:50] you know that's a that's a natural part
[17:52] of our life yeah we are to live he said
[17:54] it's a normal part of the Christian Life
[17:56] you're going to go through hard times
[17:58] you're going to go through persecutions
[18:00] you're going to face these things oh
[18:02] yeah and and brother even the Apostle
[18:05] Paul tells us that you know we've got a
[18:07] little bit of suffering left to do all
[18:09] also right because you know what hey
[18:12] each each believer has to go through the
[18:15] next the uh walk that Abraham took right
[18:18] and we'll get in I'm going to show you a
[18:20] few things in the life of Abraham but
[18:22] you know each one of us have to have
[18:23] that same walk the children of Abraham
[18:25] take the same Journey that Abraham and
[18:28] so we have to go through the same things
[18:29] that we're going to face hard times and
[18:31] we're facing on face trials but you know
[18:34] what I I found out one thing you know
[18:36] what it's a wonderful thing because we
[18:38] look at them and say well we don't want
[18:39] to go through those things no right but
[18:41] you know what God's there
[18:43] and you know you look through these
[18:45] things and you see what God has prepared
[18:47] for us
[18:48] you know David said he said you know if
[18:50] I go into heaven he's there right he
[18:53] said do I make my bed in hell he's there
[18:55] he's there with me no matter where I'm
[18:57] at but you know he's as as Psalm 23
[19:01] tells us you know he leads us
[19:04] he's leading us through that's right
[19:06] right you know he said because you look
[19:09] and he leads me beside the Still Waters
[19:11] he prepares a table in the presence of
[19:14] my enemies
[19:16] you know there there it is it's a time
[19:19] of refreshing in the middle of a battle
[19:21] oh yeah right Amen in the midst of a war
[19:24] right
[19:25] he said yay though I'll walk through the
[19:27] valley of the shadow of death amen he
[19:29] said I will fear no evil for thou art
[19:31] with me he said you know brother random
[19:33] said you bear do you realize that there
[19:35] has to be light
[19:37] in the valley to have a shadow exactly
[19:41] because brother Madam also says well
[19:44] we'll get to it he says the Morning Star
[19:46] comes down and stands in the valley man
[19:50] sure right and so we have light in the
[19:53] valley right yeah so we are not we're
[19:55] not left alone in the valley but we have
[19:59] to go through these things you know
[20:01] so glad
[20:08] and it's talking about the law of
[20:11] contrast
[20:12] they said you know if if we didn't have
[20:13] valleys in our life he said you wouldn't
[20:15] appreciate the good things he said you
[20:17] know we can't appreciate being on on the
[20:19] rooftops or the mountaintops unless
[20:21] we've been in a valley he said you know
[20:22] we have to drink some bad water to
[20:24] appreciate good water he said you know
[20:26] the things that have we have to go
[20:28] through we don't appreciate them unless
[20:30] we go through these things and have to
[20:32] look back on what we've been through
[20:33] that we can appreciate where we are
[20:35] that's right because you know because he
[20:37] Brothers said that the the bride always
[20:39] does better under persecution always
[20:42] does better under pressure so you know
[20:44] what if everything was always on the
[20:46] Mountaintop and everything was always
[20:47] glorious then you know we wouldn't
[20:49] appreciate that and you know that's what
[20:51] Drew Israel into the into the condition
[20:54] that she got in that the children of
[20:56] Israel got into was because when when
[20:58] they become Lacks
[21:00] then then I could just do anything they
[21:02] wanted to because you know what when it
[21:04] was not being under pressure then guess
[21:06] what their their morals and their
[21:09] standards got lacks right
[21:14] and so they they come to uh
[21:18] sink down
[21:20] and get tangled up in a lot of things
[21:21] right all right
[21:27] so we appreciate but we we realize we
[21:30] have to be in living in the valley
[21:33] and uh
[21:35] here we
[21:37] read this morning
[21:39] of David been in
[21:41] the children of Israel facing the
[21:43] Philistines and you're leaving you know
[21:45] the fullest things was one of the groups
[21:46] that they just continually uh give the
[21:50] children of Israel fits
[21:51] they were all they were you know so many
[21:53] times you read in the Scripture it was
[21:54] always the Philistines opposing them but
[21:58] you know here's here's a
[22:02] the children of Israel coming to deface
[22:06] the battle
[22:07] facing the Philistines
[22:09] and you know they're just going through
[22:11] the motions
[22:13] because here you know because Goliath
[22:16] stands up there and he says why have you
[22:18] put your battle in a race right
[22:20] or why why in our terms why are you
[22:23] putting why are you posing all right
[22:26] why are you pretending right
[22:29] because you've set out your armor you
[22:32] have set your battle you've set your
[22:34] armies up like you're going to fight but
[22:35] he said I stand here and I defy the
[22:37] armies of God right he said I'm looking
[22:40] for someone to come and fight me yeah
[22:43] and he said y'all just stand on the
[22:44] other side of the mountain
[22:46] and won't come down you know
[22:50] and there he stood on stood in that
[22:52] Valley
[22:53] looking up at him and saying come on
[22:55] send somebody yeah
[22:57] all right and you know that's the way we
[22:59] act sometimes when we realize hey we're
[23:01] going to have to face a hard situation
[23:03] Lord don't let me go through that right
[23:06] I don't want to go on stand on a
[23:08] mountain
[23:09] all right
[23:13] and here they're all sitting around
[23:15] looking at Saul
[23:16] because he's he's the king he's the he's
[23:19] the man that's Head and Shoulders above
[23:21] everybody else
[23:24] we can't be disturbed because he's he's
[23:26] making battle plans
[23:28] yeah
[23:30] he's in his tent he can't be disturbed
[23:33] right
[23:36] sounds like a lot of politicians yeah
[23:39] they're too busy doing anything else to
[23:42] but then that's neither here nor there
[23:44] yeah it doesn't matter if they don't do
[23:47] anything or if they do anything it's
[23:48] still wrong yeah
[23:53] but you know here they are standing
[23:55] there and looking down on this man and I
[23:57] mean he's a he's a bigger probably
[23:59] bigger than any of them have ever seen
[24:01] in their life right yeah this man
[24:03] standing there
[24:05] and he's looking for someone to come and
[24:06] fight him
[24:09] and nobody wanted nobody wanted to come
[24:11] out to him
[24:13] but you know Dave you can't you know his
[24:15] dad sent him down there to his brothers
[24:16] and he saw what was going on he could
[24:19] not believe
[24:21] that the armies of God stood there and
[24:23] acted the way they did right right and
[24:26] so and such as such a cowardly
[24:28] position
[24:31] again we know that David wanted to go
[24:34] and fight him oh yeah
[24:36] because David had an experience right
[24:40] you know you look at a little ready
[24:42] fella that had a slingshot
[24:46] you know I wouldn't I wouldn't go with
[24:48] uh I wouldn't go with anything with a
[24:50] slingshot no
[24:52] brother Brandon said you probably
[24:53] couldn't kill a rabbit with a slingshot
[24:55] yeah
[24:56] but you know they had used these things
[24:59] and they knew what worked because you
[25:02] know Saul wanted to put his armor he
[25:04] wanted to put armor on David right
[25:08] but he's like I don't know how to use
[25:09] this though I've never proved any of
[25:11] this stuff I don't know anything about
[25:12] this but I know what I've been through
[25:14] all right I've had an experience yeah
[25:16] exactly he said when I was on the back
[25:18] side of the desert he said it was only
[25:19] me between that lion
[25:21] and that sheep right they said it was
[25:24] only made between the bear and the Sheep
[25:27] he said I was put on the back side of
[25:29] the desert to protect those sheep and he
[25:32] said I stood there and he said they came
[25:33] down and he said the spirit of the Lord
[25:35] Came Upon me and he said I killed him
[25:37] yeah
[25:38] and he said now we're standing in front
[25:40] of this uncircumcised Philistine yeah
[25:44] yeah he said I want was only doing what
[25:46] it naturally does eats
[25:48] they went after praying to Bear the same
[25:50] thing
[25:51] but now you've got this man who's
[25:53] uncircumcised defying the god of of
[25:56] Israel right exactly and it's calling
[25:58] for somebody to come and fight him
[26:02] which is the same thing you know that's
[26:03] what the devil does to you he wants you
[26:05] he wants to make you look you know and
[26:07] put pressure on you and make you think
[26:08] oh well you come right
[26:10] but you know what David said I've got it
[26:13] we've got those brother Reynolds up he
[26:15] knew and he said he knew that he was
[26:17] anointed right
[26:19] he said he remembered Samuel pouring the
[26:21] anointing along him
[26:23] all right he said and brother Brandon
[26:25] says where are the anointed in this day
[26:27] he said you've been anointed by the Holy
[26:29] Ghost he said learns the anointed today
[26:31] amen
[26:33] basically because you are anointed right
[26:36] and he said he stood there and he said
[26:38] and David went out there and he said I
[26:40] want to face him
[26:41] oh yeah
[26:42] you know what David went across you you
[26:45] think about it this huge man is standing
[26:47] in this Valley
[26:49] and you're walking this little runny boy
[26:53] still left behind the ears going down
[26:56] this massive Valley this vast area
[27:00] all the eyes are upon him
[27:03] and everybody's standing there saying
[27:05] we're going to be him
[27:06] wouldn't want to be him yeah
[27:09] but you know what David had an
[27:11] experience right right and David stood
[27:14] there and he said you know and he went
[27:15] down through that Valley and he got down
[27:17] there to the water
[27:19] and he went down there and picked those
[27:20] rocks up
[27:23] you know what and then and and Goliath
[27:25] you know he was just beside himself
[27:26] that's all y'all got to send me yeah
[27:30] he said I'm just gonna put him on the
[27:32] end of my spearing fading to the birds
[27:33] this is this is the best job God y'all
[27:36] got Army sitting in a ray all this armor
[27:38] all of these soldiers all you got is a
[27:40] little boy
[27:42] that's the best you can do
[27:46] but you know what it was all that was
[27:48] all that was needed
[27:49] that was all that was needed right and
[27:52] he stood there and when he walked out
[27:54] there he said he said you come at me
[27:55] with a spear and a sword
[27:57] he said but I'd come at you in the name
[27:59] of the Lord right right
[28:01] and he said you know what he said I'll
[28:03] remove your head from you this day yep
[28:04] right
[28:06] see yeah that's all that's all David
[28:08] needed right why because he realized the
[28:11] battle wasn't his all right but you know
[28:13] what he had to walk in faith right
[28:15] because the battle wasn't his right but
[28:18] he walked out there and he faced Goliath
[28:20] made the last come at him but you know
[28:23] what he had power
[28:25] right right brother said David had a
[28:28] hidden power he said it was the
[28:29] blessings that was upon David the
[28:31] blessing that he had upon him well
[28:33] because he was going to be king right he
[28:35] was anointed
[28:38] ain't no nothing was going to say
[28:39] anything why because he knew what God
[28:41] had done for him and what God was going
[28:43] to do all right
[28:45] and you know what it became it became
[28:47] God's battle when when he decided when
[28:50] he defied God right he wasn't David he
[28:53] wasn't the armies it was God
[28:55] but all he had to do is just go out
[28:57] there and be God's representative
[29:00] all he had to do was put that rock in
[29:02] the sling it didn't matter where he
[29:03] threw it right
[29:06] they could throw it anywhere but God had
[29:09] it it was a supernatural event all right
[29:12] that's right
[29:14] there's one he let go of that rock it
[29:16] hit exactly where it had to hit him
[29:17] right
[29:19] you know brother Brandon was talking
[29:20] about
[29:21] um
[29:22] hit uh
[29:24] who's preaching at the at the Tabernacle
[29:27] and he was preaching on the
[29:30] all of the resistance
[29:32] that David had
[29:34] you know he faced all this opposition
[29:36] why because nobody wanted him to do that
[29:38] all right
[29:40] everybody was so afraid they said you
[29:43] know what everybody got encouraged one
[29:44] day we went up there and killed him yeah
[29:45] well yeah right
[29:47] then everybody's like yeah we can take
[29:49] them now
[29:51] then everybody wanted to start following
[29:53] and doing something right they chasing
[29:56] them
[29:57] but you know what we see that this today
[30:01] you know because we stand here this
[30:03] morning and we wonder sometimes I wonder
[30:05] if the Lord's gonna heal me
[30:10] I want I wonder how long I'm going to
[30:12] have to wait yeah yeah man that's right
[30:16] you know I wonder about this and I
[30:17] wonder about that right
[30:20] right well you know what he said he said
[30:21] if you come by faith
[30:23] if you meet the same requirements that
[30:25] someone else has met sure
[30:28] he said he's obligated to do it again
[30:29] that's right or he's a liar right so I
[30:33] mean we stand here this morning we look
[30:34] at we look at all the Miracles that's
[30:36] happened I mean we don't look at the
[30:37] Bible we look at what's happening just
[30:39] in this church right
[30:42] that's right brother you know
[30:46] I I can't remember who it was
[30:49] not an assistant Freedom somebody lost
[30:51] something
[30:52] somebody
[30:54] on Facebook on there somebody lost
[30:56] something and you know what I was
[30:58] thinking about that
[30:59] that
[31:00] I don't know if I I told it here I know
[31:02] to some of you but you know I lost I
[31:05] lost the work keeps them to my work van
[31:08] and I was at the shop and I parked it
[31:10] and I left an awesome I couldn't figure

[31:13] them we looked all over the place and
[31:15] you know I've got
[31:16] it's a we've got a single door and then
[31:19] we've got a bay door and we've got
[31:21] double doors on each side of the
[31:22] building
[31:23] and I lost them and we started looking
[31:27] for them and we had a job to do next day
[31:28] and I had to find those keys and we look
[31:31] high and low I looked at home they
[31:32] looked at work everywhere and I said
[31:35] Lord I need to find those keys
[31:38] and we've got a and they got a a little
[31:41] Grill sitting right beside the garage
[31:43] door
[31:45] and I looked high and low we all looked
[31:47] through we looked at everything we could
[31:48] find and I couldn't find them and I'm
[31:51] pregnant Madison what we need to find
[31:52] those keys over whether
[31:56] hey brother Ron Spencer coming to me in
[31:58] a dream
[31:59] I walked up too and your brother wrote
[32:02] last time you know where you know he'll
[32:03] wear a coat when he's preaching you know
[32:05] he takes his Jago like we do but he just
[32:07] had a white shirt and that time
[32:08] everything come up to me and I said
[32:09] brother Ron I can't find those kids I
[32:11] said I don't know where they're at they
[32:13] said don't worry brother
[32:14] he said you'll find them it'll be okay
[32:16] don't worry about it
[32:19] I woke up the next morning my boss
[32:20] called me off home before I got to work
[32:30] thank you
[32:33] thanks
[32:37] and I don't know where they came from
[32:40] but you know what God knew where they're
[32:42] at and God know where to put them
[32:48] see I mean just like I think brother
[32:50] brother Dean
[32:51] right I think drove all the way to
[32:53] Greene County with a lock on the back of
[32:54] a pickup truck hand him lock the trailer
[32:56] down yeah drove all that blade now got
[32:59] down there then the lock was going on
[33:01] there yeah I haven't had fallen off
[33:03] right
[33:04] no
[33:06] you think of things like that God's
[33:08] mindful looks
[33:10] little things like that that's right
[33:12] right and here he was David
[33:16] see all God's looking for is somebody to
[33:18] be faithful that's right right we can be
[33:21] faithful we can move on the scene
[33:25] but you know he was he was hindered
[33:28] the brother Brown said
[33:33] let's see
[33:39] this is from the message second-hand
[33:40] Road
[33:42] he said I stood 10 years ago at this
[33:45] platform preaching on David and Goliath
[33:47] he said no it is it isn't that Goliath
[33:50] that's hindered me
[33:51] they said God slayed him before me yeah
[33:54] yeah he said but the thing that hindered
[33:56] me is the lack of faith the lack of
[33:58] something that I know was around yeah
[34:02] see Goliath was dead
[34:04] but the thing is it was a lack of faith
[34:06] right that's what hinders it's a lack of
[34:09] thought about it realizing hey the
[34:11] Goliath is dated yeah
[34:13] yeah you know as the the scripture tells
[34:15] us that all power is permitted of God
[34:18] right now
[34:21] the powers that be are ordained of God
[34:23] right
[34:24] so you know there's God God overdains
[34:27] all things
[34:28] but you know glass glass was already
[34:30] defeated sure but you know what it's a
[34:33] lack of our belief
[34:35] we fail to believe that right and that's
[34:38] what that's what hinders us
[34:42] and your brother Adam was talking about
[34:46] misters
[34:48] maybe somebody the the brothers he said
[34:50] you know they weren't uh educated but he
[34:54] said they follow him because brother
[34:55] Branham went out
[34:57] your brother Adam was uneducated you
[35:00] know Toby was going to pray for kings
[35:02] and potentates
[35:04] you know I'm going to have this great
[35:05] Healing Ministry
[35:09] you know nobody would have believed that
[35:10] Dr Davis sure didn't
[35:14] but you know what he said he went out
[35:15] there and started preaching and he was
[35:17] talking about brother Roberts and all
[35:18] these other brothers started falling
[35:19] right come out on the scene he said you
[35:21] know they were uneducated they didn't he
[35:23] said but they had Faith to bully right
[35:25] to go and take take on these these uh
[35:29] Devils all right
[35:31] the show that God had had the anointing
[35:35] was upon the people right that God had
[35:37] poured out his anointing
[35:39] that you know we could overcome amen and
[35:42] you know because we realize that if
[35:45] um there wasn't questions and answers
[35:47] brother random standing there you know
[35:50] what
[35:51] you know we read this a lot he said
[35:53] because brother I'm talking about the
[35:55] anointing the anointing being upon the
[35:57] people
[35:58] the other day says you know when the
[36:00] when the doors of the Gentiles is closed
[36:02] right they said then God will anoint um
[36:04] a church then all right amen but you
[36:07] know what he said and he's doing it now
[36:08] amen right
[36:11] listen you know people people say oh
[36:13] well when the doors of the gym house is
[36:14] closed and he's going to anoint oh yeah
[36:17] but you know what he's doing it right
[36:18] now all right
[36:20] I try
[36:21] but you know what we'll see we're seeing
[36:22] in a greater fashion then but you know
[36:24] what the anointing is already because
[36:26] you know what we are anointed brother
[36:28] man said this is the rapturing age we've
[36:30] entered into a Rapture name that's right
[36:32] man right and you know we've been
[36:34] anointed for that right
[36:37] yeah somebody's going to come to that
[36:38] place where that Goliath that stands in
[36:41] front of them is going to be defeated
[36:43] amen the death dance is not it's not
[36:46] going to hold them right they can't be
[36:47] held by data Amen brother
[36:50] you know what it's not it's not that
[36:52] you're going to bypass there
[36:53] right you're going to walk through it
[36:55] right you're going to defend him it's
[36:58] not something that you're going to go
[36:59] around right exactly it's not like
[37:01] you're gonna skip it
[37:02] all right
[37:03] it's not like because it's a door that
[37:06] we all have to face we all have to go
[37:08] through that door right
[37:10] right he said door that you know just
[37:11] like the doors back there you have to go
[37:12] through those doors it's not some other
[37:14] way that you're going to go out right
[37:17] but you know what when you reach that
[37:19] door death will have a hold on right
[37:21] right
[37:23] just like just like the Apostle Paul
[37:25] even though the Apostle Paul went down
[37:28] you know what he stood there and said
[37:29] that's where she you know where's the
[37:31] victory that's where's your uh victory
[37:34] yes where's your sting all right
[37:37] you know here he is even though even
[37:39] though he's gonna have his head cut off
[37:40] you know what he realized that even
[37:41] death then didn't have a hold on all
[37:43] right
[37:44] amen that was not that was you know
[37:46] what's your Victory that's right you can
[37:49] lay a hole on this flesh but he said you
[37:51] can't touch me that's right amen because
[37:55] you know what you only have a
[37:57] momentarily hole on the flesh right
[37:59] it'll go down to the ground but you know
[38:01] what it'll come back up all right
[38:03] so you know what you're always only
[38:05] going to be a temporary hold right
[38:09] but you know it's not gonna be permanent
[38:11] okay
[38:12] you know one of the things that always
[38:14] amazed me was in hey brother I was
[38:16] talking on the seals you know this and
[38:18] and the
[38:19] in the seals where it talks about the
[38:22] the rider with the sword
[38:25] you know the the second one came out and
[38:28] he had the sword and he said he comes to
[38:30] take peace from the Earth yeah
[38:33] but you know what you can't take peace
[38:36] you couldn't take their lives
[38:39] and and because they were anointed right
[38:42] right with a with a calf spirit with the
[38:45] ox Spirit they were anointed for
[38:47] sacrifice right you know you can't take
[38:50] something if somebody gives it up freely
[38:51] right amen right
[38:54] you know it's hard it's hard to rob
[38:56] somebody that wants to give you
[38:57] something right
[38:59] right you know because you know what
[39:01] that takes all the victory out of it
[39:03] right
[39:05] because you know what the victory lies
[39:07] with the person that gave it man yeah
[39:09] because when they stood there and I
[39:12] can't remember which one it was but you
[39:13] know the
[39:14] um I was reading the other day you know
[39:16] famous papers you know he didn't even
[39:17] want to be tied to the stake right
[39:20] like a polycarp we want to be tied to
[39:22] the state stood there right
[39:28] I was talking about the fox's book of
[39:30] Martyrs you go back and look at the
[39:31] different ones that was in the in the
[39:33] fox's book of Martyrs you know they was
[39:35] they tied they tied a a millstone around
[39:37] one man's neck and he stayed in the
[39:39] water and he preached for hours before
[39:41] he went under yeah tied to a millstone
[39:44] right yeah
[39:47] see you look at this you know they they
[39:49] had that anointing you know what that
[39:50] was Victory to them you couldn't take
[39:52] that away from them
[39:55] see the thing is
[39:57] you know the Devil comes to try to take
[39:59] things away from us you know what you
[40:00] know we realize sometimes we don't
[40:02] realize but later on we'll realize then
[40:04] you know it's a blessing in disguise
[40:07] anyway
[40:08] we're like well thank the Lord you know
[40:10] because you know what he's the one that
[40:11] drives as those spirits that came out
[40:14] here to that hundred thousand hundred
[40:15] thousand thousand Devils that was poured
[40:17] out you know he came upon the juice he
[40:19] said it drove them back to the Homeland
[40:20] he said it was poured on the right he
[40:22] had to drive her back to the word
[40:24] exactly amen you know we think we think
[40:28] well you know it's it's a it's a hard
[40:30] time it's it's a terrible thing you know
[40:32] what it's glorious if you can look at it
[40:33] because you know that is that is
[40:36] bringing you to the place you ought to
[40:37] be right amen you know people ask me all
[40:40] the time you know how am I doing I'm
[40:41] doing great all the time
[40:44] hey you know what I'm doing bad I'm
[40:45] doing good
[40:47] exactly I do great I do fantastic yeah
[40:52] brother brother Ray I'll take you all
[40:54] right he asked me how I'm doing
[40:57] super fantastic yeah
[41:01] he said that's all right
[41:03] no it's super fantastic
[41:07] but you know what you walk it you walk
[41:10] in in the atmosphere that you create
[41:11] amen you create that atmosphere you walk
[41:14] in you know it's just like just like the
[41:16] Hebrew children you know they had to go
[41:18] into a fiery furnace but you know what
[41:20] they created the atmosphere that that
[41:22] their environment didn't have any effect
[41:25] on them right they went down there and
[41:26] said hey we're not going to bow
[41:28] we've made up our mind
[41:30] even when it was seven times hotter and
[41:33] the guards that were trying to put them
[41:34] in there were killed you know were
[41:35] killed but they they didn't die right
[41:37] didn't have the smell of smoke on them
[41:39] didn't have a sense hair was not
[41:41] anything wrong with them they were bound
[41:43] got thrown in and next thing you know
[41:45] they're walking around free in the midst
[41:47] of the fourth man yeah when
[41:49] Nebuchadnezzar looked in he said you
[41:51] know well I thought we threw three in he
[41:52] said they're not walking around
[41:55] and he said in the midst of the fire he
[41:58] said you see the one that looks like as
[41:59] under the Son of God right right walking
[42:02] around they come out and they were just
[42:04] fine
[42:06] had absolutely nothing wrong with them
[42:10] and we got oil together that happened a
[42:11] long time ago well that was for somebody
[42:12] you know what he is the god of
[42:15] impossibility still here this morning
[42:17] you know what those men those men that
[42:20] went into that fire you know what they
[42:21] were baptized with the Holy Ghost you
[42:23] know what they were not born again right
[42:25] and we know about you know we've reached
[42:26] the Apex because we've received
[42:28] justification sanctification in the
[42:30] baptism of the holiest we've been placed
[42:32] into the body we have become what he is
[42:35] right
[42:37] and then we think well you know that's
[42:38] just too hard
[42:40] equipment
[42:41] no it's not
[42:44] because you know what he takes care of
[42:46] us right right man you know it doesn't
[42:48] matter what what comes our white case
[42:50] there and he's watching over us right
[42:51] but you know what it becomes our
[42:53] confession it's what we believe is what
[42:55] we say
[42:58] because that's exactly what happened to
[43:01] David right
[43:02] David David walked in his confession and
[43:05] walked what he believed amen and he met
[43:09] and even and even later on you know the
[43:12] Philistines came back
[43:15] how many know that yeah
[43:18] yeah and then second and second Samuel
[43:20] we find out that after David was
[43:22] anointed king and became king and rolled
[43:25] you know what the Philistines didn't
[43:26] like him right
[43:27] imagine that yeah
[43:32] the man who had killed who had killed
[43:34] their champion
[43:36] he came back to kill him
[43:39] and you know what he was standing there
[43:41] and looked like and you know he was
[43:42] David was had gathered his armies and
[43:45] was standing there was praying to God
[43:46] about going into the valley to face the
[43:49] Philistines again
[43:51] oh yeah and you know what you know what
[43:52] God told him
[43:54] you know he wouldn't know about how he
[43:55] was going to face them and he said he
[43:58] said when you hear the rustling and the
[44:00] mulberry bushes he said I will be going
[44:02] before you and Gloria he said then
[44:04] you'll go in and he said then you'll
[44:06] Smite the Felicity right that's right
[44:09] amen and you know what Brethren said
[44:11] that's what's happened today you know
[44:12] because the the anointing is still
[44:15] moving the spirit is still moving in the
[44:16] mulberry bushes it's still rustling
[44:19] before us that we are to move forward
[44:21] right
[44:22] and I believe
[44:25] it's a invisible Union
[44:27] is that where he said he said you know
[44:29] the move is on right for the bride he
[44:31] said we have entered into the rapturing
[44:33] game right
[44:35] he said it's thus saith the Lord he said
[44:37] we have we have reached this place
[44:45] because if if the if the move was on for
[44:48] David when the wrestling and the
[44:49] mulberry bush had much more for us today
[44:51] right and that's what he says he says
[44:54] it's it's got to be it's got to be
[44:56] something it's moving right now friends
[44:58] the move is on for the bride that's the
[45:00] truth that says saith the Lord right see
[45:02] the move is on today for us it's moving
[45:05] he's either before us for moving us
[45:08] forward and it's thus saith the Lord
[45:10] right well because there's a place for
[45:12] you and I to go to right right exactly
[45:15] yep see sometimes we wonder God is
[45:18] moving sometimes he's trying to get us
[45:20] to see what's happening amen because you
[45:22] know let his brother and him said you
[45:23] know we always look at the past and
[45:24] we're looking at the future but he's
[45:26] moving right now right he's right before
[45:28] us moving all right
[45:31] he's calling for us to move forward
[45:34] and then we go
[45:38] and I've got some more I want to just
[45:41] not deal with David but uh
[45:45] look at the
[45:47] the life of Abraham
[45:49] and I've got I don't know probably got a
[45:53] dozen dozen characters and and different
[45:56] scriptures and things to look at this
[45:58] one I know we're gonna get all to them
[46:00] but uh
[46:01] I just loaded up I just it's like you
[46:03] start looking at one thing and something
[46:04] else comes and you start looking at that
[46:06] and you find something else there's
[46:07] another one right keep battling
[46:10] yep
[46:12] well because you see it all through the
[46:14] Bible
[46:16] but Abraham brother and says and and uh
[46:19] tested Faith produces goods 1958 he said
[46:23] it was Abraham called from the city of
[46:24] UR the city the land of the child ends
[46:26] the Gentile
[46:28] they said he was down in the valley of
[46:30] shinar yeah
[46:32] and just an ordinary man but God spoke
[46:34] to him when he was 75 years old
[46:36] his wife Sarah 65
[46:39] been married
[46:40] since she was about 18 no children and
[46:42] God told Abraham that they were going to
[46:44] have a baby right and Abraham believed
[46:46] God and he called anything contrary to
[46:48] what God had said as though it was not
[46:50] believing and that God was able to keep
[46:52] his promise
[46:54] so you know he started out in the in the
[46:58] valley
[47:00] we all did in sin
[47:02] that are worshiping Idols right
[47:05] that's right a heathen right but you
[47:08] know God come and got us all right he
[47:10] brought himself
[47:12] and speaking to Abraham
[47:14] and told and told told Abraham
[47:17] you know it was a it was an
[47:18] unconditional Covenant
[47:21] I'm so glad he has that for us
[47:24] you know where as as the children of
[47:26] Abraham Glory that loyal seed you know
[47:29] he has he has it for us it's not
[47:31] anything that we've done right amen it's
[47:34] his it's by his grace yes we are what we
[47:37] are
[47:39] and you know hey Miss late even through
[47:40] all the things that he had to go through
[47:42] 25 years
[47:44] a walking
[47:45] believing that he was going to have a
[47:47] son right all the things that he went
[47:49] through
[47:50] all the faults and failures that he had
[47:54] you're looking you know a lot of times
[47:56] you'll hear people say
[47:57] you know as well you know Sarah laughed
[47:59] Sarah well you know Abraham did too yeah
[48:01] right exactly but you know all the you
[48:04] look at all the things that Abraham had
[48:05] went through in his life
[48:07] you know he walked with God that he
[48:09] backslid that he walked with God
[48:11] tried to give his wife away walk with
[48:13] God
[48:15] but everybody said boy you know it's a
[48:16] father of faith
[48:18] you know if we look at his life nobody
[48:20] want to follow him
[48:21] I don't you know because we look at him
[48:23] say Well that's that's not the example I
[48:25] want
[48:27] but you know what it's not that he
[48:29] failed
[48:30] it's not that he that he walked away he
[48:32] said he came back right right it's not
[48:35] that when somebody follows or has
[48:36] failures except when they when they get
[48:39] picked theirself up off the ground right
[48:41] and they keep walking
[48:44] like they say you know you're never
[48:46] you're never a failure until you quit
[48:48] that's when you fight yeah I'm right
[48:52] because you know what when you get back
[48:53] up you know what you're still standing
[48:55] you're still fighting all right
[48:57] if you fall down then you know what you
[48:59] can lay there yeah
[49:02] or you can get back up but if you get
[49:04] back up say you're not a failure right
[49:07] well because that's one that's what you
[49:08] know what you had to overcome that right
[49:12] that was something you overcame hey I
[49:13] overcame I failed
[49:16] and then I can move forward right
[49:19] and then we see Abraham
[49:21] all the things that he went through in
[49:22] his life
[49:24] but you know he started out wrong right
[49:28] you know God had to deal with it and
[49:30] keep working on them they had to keep
[49:31] him whittling away
[49:33] and he said you know get away from your
[49:35] family right you get out to the place
[49:37] I'll show you that's right and then he
[49:39] had this little problem with lot
[49:43] they said they said a leaving lot he's
[49:45] do I have to bring a lot along
[49:47] well you know that was just a throwing
[49:49] in the flesh for a while till they got
[49:50] rid of it
[49:53] and he said you know we can't live we
[49:54] can't strive together he said you know
[49:56] what he said you choose where you want
[49:57] to go and he said he said I'll choose
[50:00] the other direction right
[50:02] but you know what a lot had his eye on
[50:04] on the best or he thought was the best
[50:08] but you know what it led right into
[50:11] singing right he got there and he's like
[50:13] oh you know I swear I want to be I want
[50:15] to be down here on the planes boy it
[50:16] looks so pretty
[50:20] he said well you know he won't he wanted
[50:21] to be over by salt yeah
[50:25] well he got so close he got so close
[50:28] that way you know over by he ended up in
[50:30] so right
[50:33] that's what happens sometimes you get
[50:35] too close and you know it's like well I
[50:37] get this close I get this close
[50:40] that's where a lot ended up
[50:42] well you know what he ended up and he
[50:44] said it it vexed his righteous Soul
[50:46] daily to be in the place he was in yeah
[50:48] people in a mess right and then the next
[50:51] thing you know he ends up being captive
[50:53] he got captured yeah when the Kings went
[50:56] to battle they captured him right
[50:59] and he was taking off so you know what
[51:01] his brother
[51:04] had to go after him
[51:07] which I think was actually his uncle but
[51:09] you know he had to go eat
[51:12] three eight 318 men
[51:16] well that's a that's a resounding Army
[51:21] 318. yeah yeah well you know it's a you
[51:24] know I you know I just builds faith in
[51:26] you when you when you're going out to
[51:28] fight all these Kings and you only got
[51:29] 318 yeah
[51:31] but you know that's all they needed
[51:33] right right
[51:35] sink down
[51:37] and get tangled up in a lot of things
[51:38] all right all right
[51:44] so we appreciate but we we realize we
[51:47] have to be in living in the valley
[51:50] and uh
[51:52] here we read this morning
[51:56] of David been in
[51:58] the children of Israel facing the
[52:00] Philistines in your life you know the
[52:02] first things was one of the groups that
[52:04] they just continually uh give the
[52:07] children invisible fits they were all
[52:09] there you know so many times you read in
[52:11] the Scripture it was always the
[52:12] Philistines opposing them but you know
[52:15] here's here's a uh
[52:18] the children of Israel
[52:20] come into the face
[52:23] the battle
[52:24] facing the Philistines
[52:26] and you know they're just going through
[52:28] the motions
[52:30] because here you know because Goliath
[52:33] stands up there and he says why have you
[52:35] put your battle in a rain right
[52:37] or why why in our terms why are you
[52:40] putting why are you posing right
[52:43] why are you pretending right
[52:46] because you've set out your armor you
[52:48] have set your battle you've set your
[52:50] armies up like you're gonna fight but he
[52:52] said I stand here and I defy the armies
[52:55] of God right he said I'm looking for
[52:57] someone to come and fight me yeah and he
[53:00] said y'all just stand on the other side
[53:02] of the mountain
[53:03] they won't come down yeah
[53:07] and there he stood on stood in that
[53:09] Valley
[53:10] looking up at him and saying come on
[53:12] send somebody yeah
[53:14] all right and you know that's the way we
[53:16] act sometimes when we realize hey we're
[53:18] gonna have to face a hard situation Lord
[53:20] don't let me go through that right
[53:23] I don't want to go I don't stand on the
[53:25] mountain
[53:26] all right
[53:30] and here they're all sitting around
[53:31] looking at Saul
[53:33] because he's he's the king he's the he's
[53:36] the man that's Head and Shoulders above
[53:37] everybody else
[53:39] yep
[53:41] we can't be disturbed because he's he's
[53:43] making battle plans
[53:45] yeah
[53:47] he's in his tent he can't be disturbed
[53:50] right
[53:53] sounds like a lot of politicians yeah
[53:56] they're too busy doing anything else to
[53:59] but they need us neither here nor there
[54:01] yeah it doesn't matter if they don't do
[54:04] anything or if they do anything it's
[54:05] still wrong yeah
[54:10] but you know here they are standing
[54:12] there and looking down on this man and I
[54:14] mean he's a he's a bigger probably
[54:16] bigger than any of them have ever seen
[54:18] in their life right yeah this man
[54:20] standing there
[54:21] and he's looking for someone to come and
[54:23] fight him
[54:26] and nobody wanted nobody wanted to come
[54:28] out to him
[54:30] but you know David you know his dad send
[54:32] him down there to his brothers and he
[54:34] saw what was going on they could not
[54:36] believe
[54:38] that the armies of God stood there and
[54:40] acted the way they did right right and
[54:43] so and such as such a cowardly
[54:45] position
[54:47] and you know we know that
[54:49] David wanted to go and find him
[54:53] because David had an experience right
[54:57] you know you you look at a little ready
[54:59] fella that had a slingshot
[55:03] you know I wouldn't I wouldn't go with
[55:05] uh I wouldn't go with anything but a
[55:07] slingshot no
[55:09] brother Brandon said you probably
[55:10] couldn't kill a rabbit with a slingshot
[55:12] yeah
[55:13] yeah but you know they
[55:16] they and they knew what worked because
[55:19] you know Saul wanted to put his armor he
[55:21] wanted to put armor on David right
[55:24] but he's like I don't know how to use
[55:26] this though I've never approved any of
[55:28] this stuff I don't know anything about
[55:29] this but I know what I've been through
[55:31] all right I've had an experience exactly
[55:33] he said when I was on the back side of
[55:35] the desert he said it was only me
[55:36] between that lion
[55:38] and that sheep he said it was only me
[55:41] between the bear and the Sheep he said I
[55:45] was put on the back side of the desert
[55:46] to protect those sheep and he said I
[55:49] stood there and he said they came down
[55:50] and he said the spirit of the Lord Came
[55:52] Upon me and he said I killed him yeah
[55:55] and he said now we're standing in front
[55:57] of this uncircumcised Felicity yeah yeah
[56:00] he said a lion was only doing what it
[56:03] naturally does eats
[56:05] they went after praying to Bear the same
[56:07] thing
[56:08] but now you've got this man who's
[56:10] uncircumcised defying the god of of
[56:12] Israel right exactly and it's calling
[56:15] for somebody to come and fight him
[56:18] which is the same thing you know that's
[56:20] what the devil does to you he wants you
[56:22] he wants to make you look you know and
[56:24] put pressure on you and make you think
[56:25] oh will you come right
[56:27] but you know what David said I've got it
[56:30] we brought those brother Brown said he
[56:32] knew that he knew that he was anointed
[56:34] right
[56:35] he said he remembered Samuel pouring the
[56:38] anointing along him
[56:40] right he said and brother Brandon says
[56:42] where are the anointed in this state he
[56:44] said you've been anointed by the Holy
[56:45] Ghost he said where is the anointed
[56:48] today amen
[56:49] he said because you are anointed all
[56:52] right
[56:53] and he said he stood there and he said
[56:54] and David went out there and he said I
[56:56] want to fight scene
[56:58] oh yeah
[56:59] you know what David went across you you
[57:02] think about it this huge man is standing
[57:04] in this Valley
[57:06] and you're walking this little runny boy
[57:10] still left behind the ears going down
[57:13] this massive Valley this vast area
[57:16] all the eyes are upon him
[57:20] and everybody's standing there saying
[57:22] we're going to be him
[57:23] wouldn't want to be him yeah
[57:26] but you know what David had an
[57:28] experience right right and David stood
[57:31] there and he said you know and he went
[57:32] down through that Valley and he got down
[57:34] there to the water
[57:36] and he went down there picked those
[57:37] rocks up
[57:40] you know what and then and and Goliath
[57:42] you know he was just beside himself he
[57:44] said oh y'all got to send me yeah
[57:47] he said I'm just gonna put him on the
[57:49] end of my Spear and feed him to the
[57:50] birds this is the best job got y'all got
[57:53] Army sitting in a ray all of this Armor
[57:55] All these soldiers all you got is a
[57:57] little boy
[57:59] that's the best you can do
[58:03] but you know what it was all that was
[58:05] all that was needed
[58:06] that was all that was needed right and
[58:09] he stood there and when he walked out
[58:10] there he said he said you come at me
[58:12] with a spear and a sword
[58:14] he said but I come at you in the name of
[58:16] the Lord
[58:18] and he said you know what he said I'll
[58:19] remove your head from you this day yep
[58:21] right
[58:23] see here that's all David needed right
[58:26] why because he realized the battle
[58:28] wasn't his all right but you know what
[58:30] he had to walk in faith because the
[58:33] battle wasn't his right but he walked
[58:35] out there and he faced Goliath all right
[58:37] hey Black come at him but you know what
[58:40] he had power
[58:42] right right brother said David had a
[58:44] hidden power he said it was the
[58:46] blessings that was upon David the
[58:48] blessing that he had upon him why
[58:50] because he was going to be king right he
[58:52] was anointed
[58:55] he knew nothing was going to stand in
[58:56] front of him why because he knew what
[58:57] God had done for him and what God was
[59:00] going to do all right
[59:02] and you know what it became it became
[59:04] God's battle when when he defied that
[59:06] when he defied God right he wasn't David
[59:09] he wasn't the armies it was God
[59:12] but all he had to do was just go out
[59:14] there and be God's representative
[59:17] all he had to do was put that rock in
[59:19] the slang it didn't matter where he
[59:20] threw it right
[59:23] he could throw it anywhere
[59:25] but God had it
[59:27] Supernatural event all right that's
[59:29] right
[59:31] there's one he let go of that rock it
[59:33] hit exactly where it had to hit him
[59:34] right
[59:36] you know brother Brandon was talking
[59:37] about
[59:38] um
[59:39] hit uh
[59:41] was preaching at the at the Tabernacle
[59:44] and he was preaching only
[59:46] all of the resistance
[59:49] that David had
[59:51] you know he faced all this opposition
[59:53] why because nobody wanted him to do that
[59:55] all right
[59:57] everybody was so afraid they said you
[1:00:00] know what everybody got encouraged one
[1:00:01] day we went up there and killed him yeah
[1:00:02] well yeah right
[1:00:04] then everybody's like yeah we can take
[1:00:05] them now
[1:00:08] then everybody wanted to start following
[1:00:10] and doing something right they chase
[1:00:12] them
[1:00:14] but you know what we see that this today
[1:00:18] you know because we stand here this
[1:00:20] morning and we wonder sometimes I wonder
[1:00:22] if the Lord's going to heal me
[1:00:27] I want I wonder how long I'm going to
[1:00:29] have to wait yeah yeah man that's right
[1:00:32] you know I wonder about this and I
[1:00:34] wonder about that right
[1:00:37] well you know what he said he said if
[1:00:38] you come by faith
[1:00:40] if you meet the same requirements that
[1:00:42] someone else has met sure
[1:00:44] he said he's obligated to do it again
[1:00:46] that's right or he's a liar right so I
[1:00:50] mean we stand here this morning we look
[1:00:51] at we look at all the Miracles that's
[1:00:53] happened I mean we don't look at the
[1:00:54] Bible we look at what's happening in
[1:00:55] this just in this church right right
[1:01:00] you know
[1:01:03] I I can't remember who it was
[1:01:06] but it's just assistant Freedom somebody

[1:01:11] admit somebody on Facebook and they come

[1:01:43] for them and we had a job to do the next
[1:01:45] day and I had to find those keys
[1:01:47] and we look high and low I looked at
[1:01:48] home they looked at work everywhere and
[1:01:52] I said Lord I need to find those keys
[1:01:55] and we've got a and they've got a a
[1:01:57] little Grill sitting right beside the
[1:02:00] garage door
[1:02:02] and I looked high and low we all did we
[1:02:04] looked at everything we could find and I
[1:02:06] couldn't find them and I prayed that
[1:02:08] night I said Lord we need to find those
[1:02:09] keys over there
[1:02:13] hey brother Ron Spencer coming to me in
[1:02:15] a dream
[1:02:16] I walked it to him and your brother
[1:02:18] wrong last time you know where you know
[1:02:20] he'll wear a coat when he's preaching
[1:02:21] you know he takes a joke like we do and
[1:02:23] but he just had a little white shirt and
[1:02:24] that time everything came up to me and I
[1:02:26] said brother Rhonda can't find those
[1:02:27] keys I said I don't know where they're
[1:02:29] at they said don't worry brother
[1:02:31] he said you'll find them it'll be okay
[1:02:33] don't worry about it
[1:02:36] I woke up the next morning my boss
[1:02:37] called me I told him before I got to
[1:02:38] work
[1:02:40] like I said we found those keys he said
[1:02:42] they were laying on top of the griggle
[1:02:54] and I don't know where they came from
[1:02:57] but you know what God knew where they're
[1:02:59] at and God knew where to put them
[1:03:04] see I mean just like I think brother
[1:03:07] brother Dean
[1:03:08] right now they drove all the way to
[1:03:10] Greene County with a lock on the back of
[1:03:11] a pickup truck hand him off the trailer
[1:03:13] down yeah drove all that weight now got
[1:03:16] down there then the lock was still on
[1:03:18] there yeah I haven't had fallen off
[1:03:20] right
[1:03:29] and here he was David
[1:03:33] see all God's looking for is somebody to
[1:03:35] be fighting all right right right we can
[1:03:38] be faithful he can move on the scene
[1:03:42] but you know he was he was hindered
[1:03:45] and brother Brown said
[1:03:50] let's see
[1:03:55] this is from the message second hand
[1:03:57] robe
[1:03:59] he said I stood 10 years ago at this
[1:04:02] platform preaching on David and Goliath
[1:04:04] he said no he is it isn't that Goliath
[1:04:07] that's hindered me
[1:04:08] he said God slayed him before me yep
[1:04:11] yeah he said but the thing that hindered
[1:04:13] me is the lack of faith black is
[1:04:15] something that I know was around Church
[1:04:19] see Goliath was dead but the thing is it
[1:04:22] was a lack of faith right that's what
[1:04:24] hinders it's a lack of thought realizing
[1:04:27] hey the Goliath is dead yeah
[1:04:30] you know as the the scripture tells us
[1:04:32] that all power is permitted of God right
[1:04:36] now
[1:04:38] the powers that be are ordained of God
[1:04:39] right
[1:04:41] so you know there's God God overdains
[1:04:43] all things
[1:04:45] but you know glass glass was already
[1:04:47] defeated sure but you know what it's a
[1:04:50] lack of our belief right
[1:04:52] we fail to believe that right and that's
[1:04:55] what that's what hinders us
[1:04:58] and your brother Adam was talking about
[1:05:03] misters
[1:05:05] maybe something about the the brothers
[1:05:06] he said you know they weren't uh
[1:05:09] educated they said they follow they
[1:05:11] called brother Branham went out
[1:05:14] your brother Adam was uneducated you

[1:05:18] and potentates
[1:05:21] you know I was going to have this great
[1:05:22] Healing Ministry
[1:05:25] you know nobody would have believed that
[1:05:27] Dr Davis sure didn't exactly right
[1:05:30] but you know what he said he went out
[1:05:32] there and started preaching then he saw
[1:05:34] my brother Roberts and all these other
[1:05:35] brothers started falling right come out
[1:05:37] on the scene he said you know they were
[1:05:38] uneducated they didn't raise them but
[1:05:41] they had Faith to bully right right to
[1:05:42] go and take take on these these uh
[1:05:46] Devils all right
[1:05:48] the show that God had had the anointing
[1:05:52] was upon the people right that God had
[1:05:54] poured out his anointing
[1:05:56] that you know we could overcome amen and
[1:05:59] you know because we realize that if
[1:06:02] um
[1:06:03] there wasn't questions and answers
[1:06:04] brother man I'm standing there you know
[1:06:06] what
[1:06:08] you know we read this a lot he said
[1:06:10] because brother I'm talking about the
[1:06:11] anointing the anointing being upon the
[1:06:14] people
[1:06:15] the other day says you know when the
[1:06:17] when the doors of the Gentiles is closed
[1:06:19] right he said then God will anoint um a
[1:06:21] church then right amen but you know what
[1:06:24] he said then he's doing it now amen
[1:06:25] right
[1:06:27] listen you know people people say oh
[1:06:29] well when the doors of the gym house is
[1:06:31] closed then he's going to anoint oh yeah
[1:06:34] but you know what he's doing it right
[1:06:35] now all right
[1:06:37] that's right
[1:06:38] but you know what we'll see we're
[1:06:39] sitting in a greater fashion then but
[1:06:41] you know what the anointing is already
[1:06:42] here because you know what we are
[1:06:44] anointed brother remember said this is
[1:06:46] the rapturing age we've entered into a
[1:06:48] Rapture name that's right man right and
[1:06:50] you know we've been anointed for that
[1:06:52] right yeah
[1:06:54] somebody's going to come to that place
[1:06:56] where that Goliath that stands in front
[1:06:58] of them is going to be defeated amen the
[1:07:01] death dance is not it's not going to
[1:07:03] hold them right they can't be held by
[1:07:05] dead heaven
[1:07:07] you know what it's not it's not that
[1:07:08] you're going to bypass today huh you're
[1:07:11] gonna walk through him right you're
[1:07:13] going to defend me yes it's not
[1:07:15] something that you're going to go around
[1:07:16] right
[1:07:19] right it's not like because it's a door
[1:07:23] that we all have to face we all have to
[1:07:25] go through that door right
[1:07:27] he said door that you know just like the
[1:07:28] doors back there you have to go through
[1:07:29] those doors it's not some other way that
[1:07:31] you're going to go out right right
[1:07:34] but you know what when you reach that
[1:07:36] door death will have a hold on right
[1:07:38] right
[1:07:40] just like just like the Apostle Paul
[1:07:42] even though the Apostle Paul went down
[1:07:45] you know what he stood there and said
[1:07:46] death wishes you know where's your
[1:07:47] pictures
[1:07:49] uh victory
[1:07:51] death where's your sandwich all right
[1:07:54] you know here he is even though even
[1:07:55] though he's gonna have his head cut off
[1:07:57] you know what he realized that even
[1:07:58] death then didn't have a hold on man
[1:08:01] that was not that was you know what's
[1:08:03] your Victory that's right you can lay a
[1:08:06] hole on this flash but he said you can't
[1:08:09] touch me that's right amen because you
[1:08:12] know what you only have a momentarily
[1:08:14] hole on the flesh right it'll go down to
[1:08:17] the ground but you know what it'll come
[1:08:18] back up all right
[1:08:20] so you know what you're always only
[1:08:22] going to be a temporary hold right
[1:08:26] but you know it's not going to be
[1:08:27] permanent
[1:08:29] you know one of the things that always
[1:08:31] amazed me was in hey brother I was
[1:08:33] talking on the seals you know this and
[1:08:35] and the
[1:08:36] in the seals where it talks about the
[1:08:39] the rider with the sword
[1:08:42] you know the the second one come out and
[1:08:44] he had the sword and he said he comes to
[1:08:47] take peace from the Earth yeah
[1:08:50] but you know what right you can't take
[1:08:52] peace you can take their lives
[1:08:56] and and because they were anointed right
[1:08:59] right with a with a calf spirit with the
[1:09:02] ox Spirit they were anointed for
[1:09:04] sacrifice right you know you can't take
[1:09:06] something if somebody gives it up freely
[1:09:08] that's right amen right
[1:09:11] you know it's hard to rob somebody who
[1:09:13] wants to give you something right
[1:09:16] right you know because you know what
[1:09:18] that takes all the victory out of it
[1:09:20] right
[1:09:22] because you know what the victory lies
[1:09:24] with the person that gave it man yeah
[1:09:26] because when they stood there and I
[1:09:28] can't remember which one it was but you
[1:09:30] know the
[1:09:31] um I was reading the other day you know
[1:09:33] famous people you know hate anymore to
[1:09:34] be tied to the steak
[1:09:37] polycar green want to be tied to the
[1:09:39] state stand there right
[1:09:42] you know I know and you know you go back
[1:09:44] brother and uh brother I was talking
[1:09:46] about the fox's book of Martyrs you go
[1:09:47] back and look at the different ones that
[1:09:49] was in the in the fox's book of Martyrs
[1:09:51] you know they was they tied they tied a
[1:09:53] a millstone around one man's neck and he
[1:09:55] stayed in the water and he preached for
[1:09:58] hours before he went under yeah tied to
[1:10:00] a millstone
[1:10:03] see you you look at this you know they
[1:10:05] they had that anointing you know what
[1:10:07] that was Victory to them you couldn't
[1:10:09] take that away from them
[1:10:12] 09 uses
[1:10:13] you know the Devil comes to try to take
[1:10:15] things away from us you know what you
[1:10:17] know we realize sometimes we don't
[1:10:19] realize but later on we'll realize then
[1:10:21] you know it's a blessing in disguise
[1:10:25] we ain't gonna thank the Lord did you
[1:10:27] know because you know what he's the one
[1:10:28] that drives as those spirits that came
[1:10:31] out here to that hundred thousand
[1:10:32] hundred thousand thousand Devils that
[1:10:33] was poured out you know It Came Upon the
[1:10:35] juice he said it drove them back to the
[1:10:37] Homeland he said it was poured on the
[1:10:39] right by the driver back to the word
[1:10:41] exactly amen
[1:10:43] you know we think we think well you know
[1:10:45] it's it's a it's a hard time it's it's a
[1:10:48] terrible thing you know what it's
[1:10:49] glorious if you can look at it because
[1:10:51] you know that is that is bringing you to
[1:10:53] the place you ought to be
[1:10:55] you know people ask me all the time you
[1:10:57] know how am I doing I'm doing great all
[1:10:59] the time right now man hey you know what
[1:11:01] I'm doing bad I'm doing good
[1:11:03] right exactly I do great I do fantastic
[1:11:08] yeah

[1:11:13] super fantastic yeah
[1:11:18] he said that's all right
[1:11:20] no it's super fantastic
[1:11:24] but you know what you walk it you walk
[1:11:26] in in the atmosphere that you create
[1:11:28] amen you create that atmosphere you walk
[1:11:31] in it you know it's just like just like
[1:11:33] the Hebrew children you know they had to
[1:11:35] go into a fiery furnace but you know
[1:11:36] what they created the atmosphere that
[1:11:39] that their environment didn't have any
[1:11:41] effect on them right they went down
[1:11:43] there and said hey we're not going to
[1:11:44] bow
[1:11:45] we've made up our mind
[1:11:47] even when it was seven times hotter and
[1:11:49] the guards that were trying to put them
[1:11:51] in there were killed you know were
[1:11:52] killed but they they didn't die didn't
[1:11:55] have the smell of smoke on them didn't
[1:11:57] have a sense hair was not anything wrong
[1:11:59] with them they were bound got thrown in
[1:12:01] and next thing you know they're walking
[1:12:02] around free in the midst of the fourth
[1:12:04] man when Nebuchadnezzar looked in he
[1:12:07] said you know well I thought we threw
[1:12:08] three in he said they're down they're
[1:12:10] walking around
[1:12:12] and he said in the midst of the fire he
[1:12:15] said you see the one that looks like as
[1:12:16] under the Son of God right right walking
[1:12:19] around they come out and they were just
[1:12:21] fine
[1:12:23] had absolutely nothing wrong with them
[1:12:26] right and we know oil together that
[1:12:28] happened a long time ago well that was
[1:12:29] for somebody else you know what he is
[1:12:31] the god of impossibility still here this
[1:12:33] morning you know what those men those
[1:12:36] men that went into that fire you know
[1:12:38] what they were baptized with the Holy
[1:12:39] Ghost you know what they were not born
[1:12:41] again right and we know about you know
[1:12:43] we've reached
[1:12:44] because we 've received justification
[1:12:46] sanctification baptism of the holy we've
[1:12:49] been placed into the body we have become
[1:12:51] what he is right exactly and then we
[1:12:54] think well you know that's just too hard
[1:12:58] no it's not no all right
[1:13:01] because you know what he takes care of
[1:13:03] us right right man you know it doesn't
[1:13:05] matter what what comes our way he's
[1:13:06] there and he's watching over us but you
[1:13:09] know what it becomes our confession it's
[1:13:11] what we believe is what we say
[1:13:13] right there
[1:13:15] he knows that's exactly what happened to
[1:13:18] David right
[1:13:19] David David walked in his confession and
[1:13:21] walked while he believed amen and he
[1:13:24] meant
[1:13:26] and even and even later on you know the
[1:13:29] Philistines came back
[1:13:32] let me know that yeah
[1:13:35] and and second and second Samuel we find
[1:13:37] out that after David was anointed king
[1:13:40] and became king and rolled you know what
[1:13:42] the Philistines didn't like him right
[1:13:44] right imagine that
[1:13:49] the man who had killed who had killed
[1:13:51] their champion
[1:13:53] he came back to kill him
[1:13:55] yeah and you know what he was standing
[1:13:58] there and looked like and you know he
[1:13:59] was David was had gathered his armies
[1:14:01] and what standing there was praying to
[1:14:03] God about going into the valley to face
[1:14:05] the Philistines again
[1:14:08] and you know what you know what God told
[1:14:10] him
[1:14:10] you know he wouldn't know about how he
[1:14:12] was going to face them and he said he
[1:14:15] said when you hear the rustling and the
[1:14:17] mulberry bushes he said I will be going
[1:14:19] before you Gloria he said then you'll go
[1:14:21] in and he said Daniel samite the
[1:14:23] Philistines right that's right
[1:14:26] amen and you know what brother random
[1:14:28] said that's what's happened today you
[1:14:29] know because the the anointing is still
[1:14:32] moving the spirit is still moving in the
[1:14:33] mulberry bushes they still wrestling
[1:14:35] before us right that we are to move
[1:14:37] forward right
[1:14:39] and I believe it's uh
[1:14:42] invisible Union
[1:14:44] is that where he said he said you know
[1:14:46] the move is on right for the bride he
[1:14:48] said we have entered into the rapturing
[1:14:50] age right
[1:14:52] he said it's thus saith the Lord he said
[1:14:54] we have we have reached this place
[1:15:02] because if if the move was on for David
[1:15:05] when the wrestling and the mulberry bush
[1:15:07] had much more for us today right
[1:15:09] and that's what he says he says it's
[1:15:11] it's got to be it's got to be something
[1:15:13] it's moving right now friends the move
[1:15:15] is on for the bride that's the truth
[1:15:17] that's safe for the Lord right see the
[1:15:19] move is on today for us yes it's moving
[1:15:22] he's either before us for moving us
[1:15:25] forward and it's thus saith the Lord
[1:15:27] right well because there's a place for
[1:15:29] you and I to go to right right exactly
[1:15:32] yeah
[1:15:33] see sometimes we wonder God is moving
[1:15:35] sometimes he's trying to get us to see
[1:15:37] what's happening amen because you know
[1:15:39] but as Brethren said you know we always
[1:15:41] look at the past and we're looking at
[1:15:42] the future but he's moving right now
[1:15:43] right he's right before us moving all
[1:15:46] right
[1:15:48] he's calling for us to move forward
[1:15:51] and then we go
[1:15:54] foreign
[1:16:02] look at the
[1:16:04] the life of Abraham
[1:16:06] and I've got I don't know probably got a
[1:16:10] dozen dozen characters and and different
[1:16:13] scriptures and things to look at this
[1:16:15] one I know we're gonna get all to them
[1:16:16] but uh
[1:16:17] I just loaded up I just it's like you
[1:16:19] start looking at one thing and something
[1:16:21] else comes and you start looking at that
[1:16:22] and you find something else there's
[1:16:24] another one right keep battling
[1:16:27] yep
[1:16:29] but because you see it all through the
[1:16:31] Bible
[1:16:33] but Abraham brother and says and and uh
[1:16:36] catch his face produces goods 1958 he
[1:16:39] said it was Abraham called from the city
[1:16:41] of UR the city the land of the Chaldeans
[1:16:43] the Gentile he said he was down in the
[1:16:46] valley of shinar yeah
[1:16:49] just an ordinary man but God spoke to
[1:16:51] him when he was 75 years old his wife
[1:16:54] Sarah 65
[1:16:56] been married since she was about 18 no
[1:16:59] children and God told Abraham that they
[1:17:01] were going to have a baby right and
[1:17:02] Abraham believed God and he called
[1:17:03] anything contrary to what God had said
[1:17:06] as though it was not believing and that
[1:17:08] God was able to keep his promise
[1:17:11] so you know he started out in the in the
[1:17:14] valley
[1:17:16] we all did in sin
[1:17:19] then our worshiping Idols right
[1:17:22] that's right and even right but you know
[1:17:25] God come and got us all right and
[1:17:27] brought us out
[1:17:29] and speaking to Abraham
[1:17:31] and told and told told Abraham
[1:17:34] you know it was a it was an
[1:17:35] unconditional Covenant
[1:17:38] I'm so glad he has that for us
[1:17:41] you know whereas as the children of
[1:17:43] Abraham Glory well you'll see you know
[1:17:46] he has he has it for us it's not
[1:17:48] anything that we've done right amen
[1:17:51] he see us it's by his grace yes we are
[1:17:54] what we are
[1:17:56] yes and you know he was leaving through
[1:17:57] all the things that he had to go through
[1:17:59] 25 years
[1:18:01] of walking
[1:18:02] believing that he was going to have a
[1:18:04] son right all the things that he went
[1:18:06] through
[1:18:07] all the thoughts and failures that he
[1:18:09] had
[1:18:11] you're looking you know a lot of times
[1:18:12] you'll hear people say
[1:18:14] you know is well you know Sarah laughed
[1:18:16] Sarah well you know Abraham did too yeah
[1:18:19] exactly but you know you look at all the
[1:18:21] things that Abraham had went through in
[1:18:23] his life
[1:18:24] you know he walked with God then he
[1:18:26] backslip then he walked with God
[1:18:28] tried to give his wife away walk with
[1:18:30] God
[1:18:31] and everybody said boy give us a father
[1:18:33] of faith
[1:18:35] you know if we look at his life nobody
[1:18:37] want to follow him
[1:18:39] I don't you know because we look at him
[1:18:40] say Well that's that's not the example I
[1:18:42] want
[1:18:44] but you know what it's not that he
[1:18:46] failed
[1:18:47] it's not that he that he walked away
[1:18:49] because he came back right right it's
[1:18:51] not that when somebody follows or has
[1:18:53] failures except when they when they get
[1:18:56] picked theirself up off the ground right
[1:18:58] and they keep walking amen
[1:19:01] like they say you know you're never
[1:19:02] you're never a failure until you quit
[1:19:05] that's when you fight yeah right right
[1:19:09] because you know what when you get back
[1:19:10] up you know what you're still standing
[1:19:12] you're still fighting all right
[1:19:14] if you fall down then you know what you
[1:19:16] can lay there yeah
[1:19:19] or you can get back yeah but if you get
[1:19:21] back up see you're not a failure right
[1:19:24] well because that's one that's what you
[1:19:25] know what you had to overcome that right
[1:19:28] that was something you overcame hey I
[1:19:30] overcame I failed
[1:19:33] and then I can move forward right
[1:19:35] and then we see Abraham
[1:19:38] all the things that he went through in
[1:19:39] his life
[1:19:42] but you know he started out wrong
[1:19:43] right
[1:19:45] you know God had to deal with it and
[1:19:46] keep working on him had to keep him
[1:19:48] whittling away
[1:19:50] he said you know get away from your
[1:19:52] family right you get out to the place
[1:19:54] I'll show you that's right
[1:19:56] right and then he had this little
[1:19:57] problem with a lot
[1:19:59] they said instead of leaving a lot he'd
[1:20:02] allowed to bring a lot along
[1:20:04] but you know that was just a throwing in
[1:20:06] the flesh for a while till they got rid
[1:20:07] of him
[1:20:09] and he said you know we can't live we
[1:20:11] can't strive together he said you know
[1:20:13] what he said you choose where you want
[1:20:14] to go
[1:20:15] and he said he said I'll choose the
[1:20:17] other direction right
[1:20:19] but you know what a lot had his eye on
[1:20:21] on the best or he thought was the best
[1:20:24] right but you know what it led right
[1:20:27] into sin right he got there and he's
[1:20:30] like oh you know I swear I want to be I
[1:20:32] want to be down here on the planes boy
[1:20:33] it looks so pretty
[1:20:42] well he got so close he got so close
[1:20:45] that way you know over by he ended up in
[1:20:47] so right
[1:20:50] that's what happens sometimes you get
[1:20:52] too close and you know it's like well I
[1:20:53] get this close I get this close
[1:20:57] that's where a lot ended up
[1:20:59] well you know what he ended up and he
[1:21:01] said it it vexed his righteous Soul
[1:21:02] daily to be in the place he was in yeah
[1:21:05] people are going to make us right and
[1:21:08] then the next thing you know he ends up
[1:21:09] being captive he got captured yeah when
[1:21:12] the Kings went to battle they captured
[1:21:14] him right
[1:21:16] and he was taken out so you know what
[1:21:18] his brother
[1:21:21] had to go after him
[1:21:23] which I think was actually his uncle but
[1:21:26] you know he had to go get it
[1:21:29] 38 318 men
[1:21:33] well that's a that's a resounding Army
[1:21:36] yeah
[1:21:37] 318. yeah yeah well you know it's a you
[1:21:41] know you know and just builds faith in
[1:21:43] you when you when you're going out to
[1:21:44] fight all these Kings and you only got
[1:21:46] 318 yeah
[1:21:48] but you know that's all they needed
[1:21:50] right right man
[1:21:52] and there he goes out there you know hey
[1:21:54] hey fights
[1:21:56] and he is able to deliver
[1:22:00] his brother lot all right bring him
[1:22:03] forth

[1:22:23] from the slaughter
[1:22:24] of Shadow Lamar
[1:22:26] and of the kings that were with him in
[1:22:28] the valley of Shabba which is in the
[1:22:30] Kingsdale

[1:22:59] was he'd come back to conquer the
[1:23:02] victory he came back

[1:23:43] of it

[1:24:28] shavai is and you see where Jerusalem is
[1:24:31] and you see where the Mount of Olives is
[1:24:33] I was looking on the map and I bet
[1:24:35] they're within a mile or two right there
[1:24:37] at that one little spot right there
[1:24:38] exactly brother Brian said the literal
[1:24:40] spot where they'll come up you look at

[1:24:48] little spot he said that's where they'll
[1:24:49] come up all right in the valley of

[1:25:28] thank you
[1:25:29] we see
[1:25:31] continuing on
[1:25:33] you know Isaac

[1:25:39] you know
[1:25:41] Abraham and Doug Wales
[1:25:43] oh yeah
[1:25:44] it had and had whales different places
[1:25:46] but you know the fullest things filled
[1:25:48] them in
[1:25:49] and follow them
[1:25:51] and you know what he had to go and dig
[1:25:54] out the whales
[1:25:57] had to get back to the water Isaac had
[1:26:00] to because the Philistines had built him
[1:26:01] in right he had to go out there and did
[1:26:03] all of them out
[1:26:05] in the valleys
[1:26:07] and then he had to keep going
[1:26:10] and dig other whales right
[1:26:12] and he was in uh in the city of Guerrera
[1:26:15] the herdsmen there you know they they
[1:26:18] were they were fighting over the whales
[1:26:20] sure
[1:26:21] he dug one well and then he had to leave
[1:26:23] right they had to fight another you know
[1:26:25] then it's all over another right and he
[1:26:27] had to move from there right right and
[1:26:29] then he had to go dig another way yeah
[1:26:31] I'm gonna try and he found out yo
[1:26:32] there's room for us all man right
[1:26:35] and so it was always it you know there's
[1:26:37] always been a struggle
[1:26:38] but you know what the water came forth
[1:26:40] amen that's right you know what Isaac
[1:26:43] got to The Living Water
[1:26:45] but you know it was a struggle to get
[1:26:46] there he had to fight his way through
[1:26:48] there that's right see it's it's
[1:26:51] you know it's going to be a battle it's
[1:26:53] going but you know what it's there for
[1:26:54] you
[1:26:55] he overcame but you know what God led
[1:26:58] him to the places and he overcame and he
[1:27:00] had to dig those Wells to get to that
[1:27:02] water right right you know that's what
[1:27:04] you have to do
[1:27:06] how do I get closer to you right

[1:27:51] perfect risk right right thank you
[1:27:57] it's a little slow catching on backpack
[1:28:03] that's what he said you know talking
[1:28:04] about pouring out the oil and the wine
[1:28:06] you know right he said you know
[1:28:08] stimulation of Revelation was the line I
[1:28:11] said that's what happens a lot of people
[1:28:12] they get so stimulated to put something
[1:28:13] else you know yeah they come to church
[1:28:15] and they get so stimulated right all
[1:28:18] right right we've entered into our
[1:28:20] arrest all right
[1:28:22] all right
[1:28:24] it's a it's a it's a battle you've got
[1:28:26] to work for right right right
[1:28:29] you you have it's something that you
[1:28:31] have to work through that's right
[1:28:34] I mean you know I
[1:28:38] there's there's other ones and uh
[1:28:41] you're like Moses and Joshua
[1:28:45] you know Moses and them have to go
[1:28:48] through
[1:28:49] when God told them that they were going
[1:28:51] to a landfilling with milk and honey
[1:28:55] so we're coming out of this place right
[1:28:59] you know this
[1:29:00] all of the all of the pressure that they
[1:29:03] were in
[1:29:05] and Egypt being oppressed and all the
[1:29:09] things I had to go through we're coming
[1:29:10] out
[1:29:11] we got where they ended up first first
[1:29:13] place they left when they left Egypt
[1:29:16] well the first thing you know you know
[1:29:18] it goes through the first thing I want
[1:29:20] to talk about is is compromising yeah
[1:29:24] you know Pharaoh Pharaoh wanted them to
[1:29:27] compromise that's right but you know
[1:29:28] what they didn't compromise on right
[1:29:30] there was no compromise no we're all
[1:29:32] going out right we're not leaving
[1:29:34] nothing behind
[1:29:40] We're not gonna leave anything behind
[1:29:43] and when we leave it's all of us all of
[1:29:45] us everything that we own everything
[1:29:47] will be going
[1:29:48] and where did they go
[1:29:50] he said well you can go the next thing
[1:29:52] you know favorites are we drop behind
[1:29:53] them where do they end up
[1:29:55] Mountain on one side all right nothing
[1:29:57] on the other all right ready to see in
[1:29:59] front of them right they're down in the
[1:30:01] back
[1:30:03] and watch the first state where's the
[1:30:04] first thing they do we're going to let
[1:30:06] them milk and honey
[1:30:08] and all of a sudden
[1:30:10] Moses why did you bring us here all
[1:30:13] right do you not know what you're doing
[1:30:17] that's right just a much I'm already
[1:30:19] complaining all right and you know
[1:30:21] anything rattled Moses he's like Lord
[1:30:23] what am I going to do look where I'm at
[1:30:28] all right and he said what'd he say he
[1:30:29] said don't don't cry to me he said speak
[1:30:31] the word and go forward one because your
[1:30:34] commission was to go into the land of
[1:30:37] milk and honey he said girl you're going
[1:30:39] into the land that I show you he said
[1:30:41] why are you complaining he's what you're
[1:30:43] doing is going forward
[1:30:44] yeah I'm gonna try it so what do you do
[1:30:46] you go up there and he spoke to them to
[1:30:48] the Red Sea and it parted right
[1:30:53] and they were able to walk upon all the
[1:30:54] dry grounds
[1:30:57] see and so when we have we have these
[1:31:00] problems that rise before us it's like
[1:31:02] Lord how am I going to make a way how am
[1:31:04] I how's this going to work out you know
[1:31:05] what it doesn't matter it's do you can
[1:31:08] you put your mind on on his stuff say
[1:31:10] you know what he'll make a way but
[1:31:12] because he's promised he's going to make
[1:31:14] a way
[1:31:16] but you know what it may not it may not
[1:31:18] be the way that I want it to work out
[1:31:19] but you know what it'll work out in his
[1:31:21] in his time and his to his Perfection
[1:31:24] all right amen and there he stood and so
[1:31:27] they were able to cross over into the
[1:31:28] land flowing we're milking honey right
[1:31:31] they were able to go into the land that
[1:31:34] God had made for them
[1:31:43] you see God had made a way for him
[1:31:45] and even when they got in and you know
[1:31:47] they were going into the land
[1:31:50] and everywhere they everywhere they went
[1:31:52] they had you know there was a valley
[1:31:53] yeah they run into running those fine
[1:31:56] folks called boab
[1:31:59] people of Moab you know they were
[1:32:00] wonderful books
[1:32:02] because Brethren said they were just as
[1:32:03] fundamental as sure as they were sure
[1:32:05] they were right mail built five you know
[1:32:09] built the seven altars had the seven
[1:32:10] sacrifices had everything set up just
[1:32:12] perfect
[1:32:14] oh we're all the same all right
[1:32:18] but you know the problem was
[1:32:21] rid of them said Moses catered to God
[1:32:25] and Balaam was catering to the world
[1:32:27] right right
[1:32:29] he was catering to bailock he wanted to
[1:32:32] do what he wanted to do
[1:32:34] and so that was the problem see one was
[1:32:37] catering to what what God wanted oh yeah
[1:32:40] because that's what he was trying to do
[1:32:42] right Moab just wanted to muddy the
[1:32:44] water right
[1:32:46] and that's what he was trying to do
[1:32:49] and here there they were down in that
[1:32:50] Valley
[1:32:51] but you know what Joshua was just trying
[1:32:53] to get through right he was just trying
[1:32:55] to lead the people through right yep and
[1:32:58] there they are on their way through
[1:33:05] the biggest problem that the children of
[1:33:07] Israel had was he said they stopped
[1:33:11] they said that was their biggest problem
[1:33:12] he said they kept shouldn't have kept on
[1:33:13] going but you know what when you stop he
[1:33:15] said that's when that's when you set up
[1:33:17] for whatever amen amen oh yeah
[1:33:19] and he said that was their problem they
[1:33:21] stopped in Moab and they started dealing
[1:33:23] with poet right they said it just keep
[1:33:25] on going man because because God told
[1:33:27] them before they went in
[1:33:28] don't look on the things of these people
[1:33:31] right don't look on the way they act
[1:33:33] right don't look at the things that they
[1:33:35] do he said keep your eyes on the prize
[1:33:37] keep your eyes on the go just keep going
[1:33:39] through exactly but you know what Moab
[1:33:42] was a you know they were able to tell
[1:33:44] them oh you know we're building these
[1:33:45] altars you know we're just as
[1:33:46] fundamental As You Are
[1:33:49] but you know what and I got their eyes
[1:33:51] off of what they were supposed to be
[1:33:53] doing and then all of a sudden when that
[1:33:55] happened
[1:33:57] the next thing you know they're messed
[1:33:59] up right
[1:34:00] right
[1:34:02] as you know Baylor sent the uh
[1:34:07] the invitation you know they went to
[1:34:08] belfior
[1:34:12] you know worshiping idols
[1:34:15] getting wrapped up in in all these
[1:34:17] things that they weren't supposed to do
[1:34:19] and I believe the scripture says that
[1:34:20] there was I think it was 42 000.
[1:34:24] right
[1:34:28] say God God's not playing around
[1:34:30] he was trying to lead them through and
[1:34:32] you know what the ones that the ones
[1:34:34] that were not did not believe
[1:34:37] the mixed multitude they fell by the
[1:34:39] wayside
[1:34:41] but you know what all the way through
[1:34:43] God was leading them and God had a place
[1:34:45] for them right all the way through
[1:34:48] you know each one of those cities that
[1:34:49] you come to you know there's a
[1:34:52] um
[1:34:53] of a significant to each one of them and
[1:34:58] uh
[1:34:58] well one of them I want to get to was
[1:35:01] there was a city this massive wall of
[1:35:04] the city that was
[1:35:05] just so so great
[1:35:08] probably one of the biggest walled
[1:35:10] cities there was I believe they had
[1:35:12] Cherry races on the top of it
[1:35:14] and it's called Jericho
[1:35:17] Jericho was this you know Jericho just
[1:35:19] wanted to win the city I mean it was a
[1:35:22] monstrosity I guess you could call it I
[1:35:25] mean it was just this huge massive place
[1:35:29] and it was in the valley
[1:35:31] because when you go down into the valley
[1:35:33] Jericho's there they're close to Jordan
[1:35:36] when you come down into the valley of
[1:35:38] the Jordan River there that's where
[1:35:39] Jericho is right
[1:35:41] right and you know here they are and you
[1:35:43] know they go into the end of the land
[1:35:46] and you're they're gonna drive out the
[1:35:47] advantage when they come to this place
[1:35:48] and they and you know you you look
[1:35:51] sometimes we just talk about the Jericho
[1:35:54] we just say the name
[1:35:55] but sometimes if you get it in your mind
[1:35:57] you look at the massive place this was
[1:35:59] they're having Chariot braces on the top
[1:36:01] this huge place
[1:36:06] and you know what God telling them said
[1:36:07] you know it's not going to be swords and
[1:36:10] Spears okay we're not going to try to
[1:36:13] break down the castle Gates
[1:36:16] but all we're going to do is March
[1:36:17] around right
[1:36:20] and he said you don't look at them you
[1:36:21] don't say anything you don't do anything
[1:36:22] all we do is March first day we go down
[1:36:25] there we walk around and you know that
[1:36:28] was that was a that was a little bit of
[1:36:29] a walk
[1:36:30] if it was that big you know you know you
[1:36:32] just didn't walk around it and you know
[1:36:34] it's like it's not like a little brisk
[1:36:35] walk you know I mean it's like you know
[1:36:37] you take your lunch with you right right
[1:36:39] you know make sure you add your good
[1:36:41] shoes on because we are going to be
[1:36:42] walking a while yeah
[1:36:45] and we walk around this thing and then
[1:36:47] the next day we come back and we walk
[1:36:49] around it
[1:36:51] but then he says you know that sound
[1:36:52] thing we're gonna walk seven times but
[1:36:54] you know what if you walk around that
[1:36:56] thing all you know once every day by the
[1:36:58] time you get to that seventh one you
[1:37:00] know you better have ate your Wheaties
[1:37:01] yeah
[1:37:03] right because you got a lot of walking
[1:37:05] in front of them that's right to go
[1:37:07] walking and walking and walking you know
[1:37:10] sometimes sometimes we just fail it's
[1:37:11] like well it's like walking around the
[1:37:13] church you know I think some of us would
[1:37:14] probably get wind and walking around the
[1:37:16] church seven times
[1:37:20] you think about walking and walking and
[1:37:23] walking and walking and then when you
[1:37:25] get done while I walk him you know what
[1:37:26] you got to do
[1:37:28] someone's got to blow on the ram horns
[1:37:30] right and then they got a Yale
[1:37:32] yeah
[1:37:35] you gotta be a pretty good shape you
[1:37:38] won't get much out of me I don't think
[1:37:39] if I had to walk all that distance and
[1:37:40] then have to do that yeah but you know
[1:37:43] what that's all they had to do was walk
[1:37:44] around this this massive and you think
[1:37:47] about that this huge place that they
[1:37:49] were standing in front of and that's all
[1:37:50] they had to do was walk around and then
[1:37:52] shout right
[1:37:55] damn it
[1:37:57] God's working and you know unusual way
[1:38:00] right and he said the ground just opened
[1:38:03] up the wall system fall down they fell
[1:38:05] down in the ground you know when they
[1:38:07] excavated Jericho you know they they
[1:38:10] said that the walls actually just opened
[1:38:11] the ground opened up it just it's down
[1:38:13] in the ground if you'd excavate a
[1:38:15] Jericho they actually found the walls
[1:38:16] are just down in the ground right
[1:38:19] when it shook and it dropped it just
[1:38:21] dropped down right
[1:38:24] and you can imagine all those people
[1:38:25] said about you know
[1:38:26] this group ain't you know was it two and
[1:38:28] a half million two million people come
[1:38:31] in there children and all right yeah how
[1:38:34] big do you think they are right yeah
[1:38:37] I mean you know if they get out there
[1:38:39] and try to chop on the on the the walls
[1:38:42] you know the gates to the city or
[1:38:43] whatever you know it's gonna take a
[1:38:45] little while you know that's right you
[1:38:47] know they'll probably get tired
[1:38:49] but you know what I just kept walking
[1:38:50] around like what are they planning on
[1:38:52] doing are they surveying on the land
[1:38:55] but all of a sudden you're standing
[1:38:56] there and you think you think
[1:38:57] everything's okay
[1:38:59] they had their mind and this great
[1:39:02] Fortress right but all of a sudden when
[1:39:04] everything starts shaking yep can you
[1:39:08] imagine when the all of a sudden opens
[1:39:09] up and you look out there and there's
[1:39:10] nothing between you and them right
[1:39:14] there's nothing there right
[1:39:17] in an instant you're all your your uh
[1:39:21] protections no yeah
[1:39:25] you know I think I think I would just
[1:39:27] stop right there
[1:39:29] but you know the scripture tells us even
[1:39:31] before that you know when Rahab right
[1:39:32] you know Rahab was in in
[1:39:35] um Jericho you know the spies had come
[1:39:37] in and they and then I had left and you
[1:39:39] know she had made a promise with them
[1:39:42] about having the silver the Scarlet
[1:39:44] thread tied in the window
[1:39:46] and you know her house would not be
[1:39:48] destroyed everybody that was in her
[1:39:50] house could be seen right yes
[1:39:52] yes and you know she stood there
[1:39:55] and had that one little string tied in
[1:39:57] there but you know what you know even
[1:39:58] even she told them
[1:40:00] don't despise you know
[1:40:02] again after after what God's done I mean
[1:40:04] there was no fighting right
[1:40:07] you know there was no fighting because
[1:40:09] you know there's no way to stop them
[1:40:11] right but here they are thinking we're
[1:40:13] just gonna hide behind the walls
[1:40:15] oh yeah
[1:40:17] I think I would have just died right
[1:40:18] there yep
[1:40:21] got these huge amount you know massive
[1:40:23] walls and next thing you know they're
[1:40:24] gone
[1:40:26] so there was no fire yep there's no way
[1:40:28] to fight nope
[1:40:31] and so you know we look at things that
[1:40:32] are impossible
[1:40:34] but you know what With God all things
[1:40:35] are possible
[1:40:36] he makes a way when there's no way right
[1:40:41] so he opens up open up the walls
[1:40:44] and they went right in right there all
[1:40:47] the way through he made a way right
[1:40:50] and
[1:40:52] I've got a I got a few more though
[1:40:55] I'm trying to get to it's 20 to 12 now
[1:40:58] but I'm gonna just hit a few
[1:41:00] Elijah and Elisha
[1:41:03] you know Elijah was was uh walking in
[1:41:08] Elijah
[1:41:09] started following Elijah
[1:41:13] and brother Brown said that was the type
[1:41:15] of of a church in Christ right right
[1:41:19] he said he went to he went to gilgal
[1:41:24] and you know every time he followed you
[1:41:26] know the people were telling him even
[1:41:28] even the school the prophets are told
[1:41:30] her told her license all right I'm just
[1:41:32] gonna be taken away from you right
[1:41:34] that's right you're actually going to be
[1:41:35] taken away from you but you know and
[1:41:37] Elijah kept trying to get Elisha to stay
[1:41:40] right he said stay in Deal go he's like
[1:41:42] no
[1:41:42] he said as the Lord lived your soul
[1:41:44] living He said I'm gonna follow you
[1:41:45] right right and he said man from from
[1:41:47] Guild golf so he goes he's going further
[1:41:50] down next time you look at you look
[1:41:52] gilgall's here and then he's coming and
[1:41:55] the second place thing went was Jericho
[1:41:56] they come into Jericho and Elijah tells
[1:41:59] Elisha stay in Jericho he's no he said
[1:42:02] is the Lord and you're so limited he
[1:42:04] said I'm following you amen right he
[1:42:06] said why he said why is it he said why
[1:42:08] are you following me
[1:42:10] if you want from me he said I want a
[1:42:12] double portion of your spirit all right
[1:42:14] he said the spirit of God that's upon
[1:42:16] you he said I want a double portion and
[1:42:18] so he stood there and he said he said he
[1:42:20] said well that's all you've asked a hard
[1:42:21] thing he said but if you you know are
[1:42:24] able to see me when I go he said then
[1:42:25] it'll come upon you right and so he kept
[1:42:28] his eyes on him each time he said he
[1:42:30] went from gilgall Brother random said
[1:42:32] tight justification he said he went into
[1:42:34] Jericho with type sanctification yeah
[1:42:37] and he said he went to he went to Jordan
[1:42:40] the crossover Jordan he said which tied
[1:42:43] to baptism of the Holy Ghost which
[1:42:44] because it was death right but you know
[1:42:46] he kept falling he said he kept going
[1:42:48] down and down right now he walked with
[1:42:50] Elijah through the valley right yeah
[1:42:52] sure
[1:43:04] it's a struggle
[1:43:09] God God just don't give you you know you
[1:43:12] you don't go through justification just
[1:43:14] like that right so it's a work it's a
[1:43:16] process right each one of these things
[1:43:18] is a process
[1:43:20] well because some people they've reached
[1:43:22] justification but they never
[1:43:23] re-sanctification right some people come
[1:43:25] and save the vacation but they never
[1:43:27] come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:28] well because they're not keeping Their
[1:43:30] Eyes On Christ right as Elisha kept his
[1:43:33] eyes on Elijah he kept walking and he
[1:43:35] kept walking and he kept walking
[1:43:37] until they got down to Jordan right
[1:43:39] and when he seen him go then he came
[1:43:41] back
[1:43:42] you know picked up that mammal
[1:43:45] and he stood there and said where is the
[1:43:47] god of Elijah right I was able to smoke
[1:43:49] the waters and Colts back right right on
[1:43:52] dry left
[1:43:53] there he was you know
[1:43:56] you know he crossed over one time
[1:43:58] was able to cross over death and then he
[1:44:00] stood there had Supernatural powers
[1:44:04] he's able to smoke the waters and he
[1:44:06] crossed over he didn't get wet right
[1:44:10] you know what there's a debt for each
[1:44:11] one of us to go through you know what
[1:44:13] there's not another death that's going
[1:44:15] to hold us right you know exactly
[1:44:16] because we are dead because you know
[1:44:18] what I can't die again
[1:44:20] right I've already died amen right
[1:44:23] so death doesn't hold and there's and
[1:44:25] there's no way that you can spiritually
[1:44:27] die right well because you because you
[1:44:29] become a part of him you've taken on
[1:44:32] eternal life amen you've taken on the
[1:44:34] Life of Christ the life of God so you
[1:44:37] know what you're just you're just as
[1:44:38] Eternal as he is right right and then
[1:44:40] Elijah Elisha was standing there and he
[1:44:42] took on this and he said where is that
[1:44:44] where is the god of Elijah
[1:44:47] they walk forward
[1:44:48] where was the where was the god of
[1:44:50] Elijah right yeah there was Elisha
[1:44:54] and he had a double portion which was
[1:44:57] the spirit of God coming down yeah and
[1:45:00] you know what we have received a double
[1:45:01] portion all right all right man what did
[1:45:04] Brother Adam say what's the what's the
[1:45:05] what's the double portion
[1:45:07] he said it was the latter rain in the
[1:45:09] former rain coming together
[1:45:12] what is it he said it's a quickening of
[1:45:14] the word Glory that's right what have we
[1:45:17] what have we received in this hour right
[1:45:18] see we have received one because we've
[1:45:21] received not just the man we've received
[1:45:23] the profit right right right right
[1:45:25] because you know what the word has to
[1:45:27] come to the prophet sure
[1:45:30] and that's why and he was and say Elijah
[1:45:32] walk by what the prophet told me right
[1:45:34] so he was leading and he was walking
[1:45:36] with the prophet yeah see if you don't
[1:45:39] and you know it's not that we're walking
[1:45:41] with a man but we're walking with Jesus
[1:45:43] Christ will walk him because you know
[1:45:44] what with our brother Brandon we never
[1:45:46] would have had Jesus Christ in our house
[1:45:48] he had to come through Amanda there had
[1:45:50] to be someone come and speak to us the
[1:45:52] words that we can follow right and when
[1:45:55] we receive those words and we're able to
[1:45:56] walk then you know what we were able to
[1:45:58] do what he done right yes
[1:46:01] because you know what brother Brown
[1:46:03] passed away brother Brown went into the
[1:46:05] ground and you know what somebody is
[1:46:07] waiting for him to come up right right
[1:46:10] you know what is somebody somebody's got
[1:46:13] to speak yeah all right Justin Justice
[1:46:16] they took up that second-handed row and
[1:46:18] he smoked the waters
[1:46:19] you know what show you know because
[1:46:21] somebody's coming to the place that that
[1:46:23] that Jordan experience is not going to
[1:46:25] hold us right amen that we're able to
[1:46:28] cross over so where where is the god of
[1:46:30] Elijah where is the god of Elijah where
[1:46:33] is the god of wait and Brandon right
[1:46:35] you know what is it too old to say he's
[1:46:38] here
[1:46:39] exactly right yeah so that's all the
[1:46:42] bikes that I know where he's at all
[1:46:43] right yeah
[1:46:44] because he's got to get in me he's got
[1:46:46] to be in you you've got to be able to
[1:46:48] stand today right right and claiming
[1:46:50] just injustice loaded that where he can
[1:46:52] raise up and say you know what I've
[1:46:54] received my double portion right
[1:46:56] that's right because you know what this
[1:46:58] morning the latter rain and the floor
[1:47:00] rain has fallen
[1:47:04] it's not that something else is coming
[1:47:09] because you know what
[1:47:10] you're hearing the word the Holy Ghost
[1:47:13] is moving all right sure he said he said
[1:47:15] it was a teaching room the former Ray
[1:47:17] was the teacher
[1:47:20] where else are you getting tilt
[1:47:22] yeah
[1:47:25] I tell you I tell you what
[1:47:28] things that people have said in over the
[1:47:30] years I tell you what I have not ever
[1:47:32] heard what I've heard in Lula Georgia
[1:47:35] that's right amen
[1:47:44] but you know what it's Jesus Christ amen
[1:47:46] it's been Jesus Christ that's come down
[1:47:48] and you know we have been taught
[1:47:51] because you you know I I you know
[1:47:54] because I could I can look and I don't
[1:47:57] have times but you you look you take you
[1:48:00] take Romans 8 I read Romans 8.
[1:48:03] and you know what as brother Dale has
[1:48:05] preached over the years talking about
[1:48:06] Romans saying talking about the enmity
[1:48:08] of them and he said
[1:48:10] he said there is therefore now no
[1:48:12] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:48:14] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:48:16] after the spirit you know what I tell
[1:48:18] you when you come to that place you know
[1:48:20] what I cannot ever look at the book of
[1:48:22] Romans 8 as I've ever did in my life
[1:48:24] because one day it was like it was
[1:48:26] covered
[1:48:27] even though I read the words off the
[1:48:30] page it was like I was looking I was
[1:48:32] something covered I could not see it why
[1:48:35] because I was reading what some man said
[1:48:38] but one day all of a sudden that opened
[1:48:40] up to me and I was looking at something
[1:48:42] and you know what it wasn't that I was
[1:48:44] reading words it was something that I
[1:48:46] experienced in a place that I could see
[1:48:49] what was laying upon those pages became
[1:48:52] an experience because you know what now
[1:48:54] today I can look and say you know what
[1:48:55] I've got false and figures but you know
[1:48:57] what today there is therefore now no
[1:49:00] condemnation to whom them that walked in
[1:49:02] the after Jesus Christ walked in the
[1:49:05] spirits not after the flesh you know
[1:49:08] what there's no North now no
[1:49:09] condemnation
[1:49:12] amen exactly see if you continue on
[1:49:16] through there he said if God before us
[1:49:18] who can be against us right
[1:49:21] see he stood there and he says he said
[1:49:23] the creation is growing waiting for the
[1:49:25] manifestations of the sons of God
[1:49:28] see what he's crying he said we we
[1:49:30] received the spirit of God whereby we
[1:49:32] cry by father right right see when you
[1:49:34] see that you receive that Spirit then
[1:49:36] you know what it just continues on but
[1:49:39] you know what I can see just as just as
[1:49:41] brother Adam said that day when he stood
[1:49:43] there he said when I received that
[1:49:44] baptism my Holy Ghost he said I realized
[1:49:46] he said I was not the son of Charles and
[1:49:48] Ella Branham exactly
[1:49:50] see sometimes we just look at that that
[1:49:52] sounds good but someday one of these
[1:49:54] days just got to click in your mind to
[1:49:55] realize I'm a Son of God right now
[1:49:58] you know what this down here is just a
[1:50:00] temporal that's that we see right here
[1:50:02] but he said Paul said to things that we
[1:50:03] don't see are Eternal right what we're
[1:50:05] looking at is just a temporary housing
