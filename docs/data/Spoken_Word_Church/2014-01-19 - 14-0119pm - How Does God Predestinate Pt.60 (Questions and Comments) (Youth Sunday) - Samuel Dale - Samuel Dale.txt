amen and amen you want to see him just look into his word good to be in the house of the Lord if you'd like to follow in your scriptures turn to Romans 8 where we've been reading maybe we'll read this for the last time for a while and we'll try to I'll try to cover a little bit through the message and then we will have questions and comments so you get ready to uh to do that really enjoyed the kids doing their job it was good especially the end that was over on the end over there that wound up to be the in because he was the end that was he was the big one yeah all right Romans 8 uh remember uh continue to pray for brother uh Richard and Aaron's daddy uh brother Dale Roberts remember to pray for him the Lord would touch him he's in that stage now you know that where's going through the therapy and they're working with him because of the stroke and everything there two strokes that he had and uh just pray to Lord Lord would bless him take care of him you know remember that uh brother Bob preaching Wednesday okay brother Bob be preaching Wednesday get these brothers in the rotation some now because we've kind of finished up our series it won't be the end of predestination but it will be at least a background for us to understand a lot about it and I hope you've enjoyed it I've enjoyed bringing it and I pray that you would just you know think about it I've tried to pour out my heart to you to tell you what I believe sir because that's the main thing is letting you know what I believe amen Romans 8 have father we thank you this day that you've been able to come down and it wouldn't something you had to do it was what you promised you'd do you'd come down in the end time and Open the Eyes of your people that they would be able to see your word and they'd be able to walk in it and then to just wait on you and father we pray that youd just allow us that opportunity to be what you want us to be have your way we love you and we thank you as we read your word you speak to our hearts bless and guide each one we know there's a lot missing this afternoon but we pray that you would just bless each one have your way now remember all these sicknesses remember Anna Lord going home there a while ago vomiting and all and we pray that you would touch her and just bring her out of this CU Satan's doing everything he can to try to hinder in any way your move among us but we lord call the hand of Satan to where that it's not not us is what you've given us the authority to speak and pray and believe God's word we love you we thank you in Jesus name amen Romans 8 28 for we know that all things work together for them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he did also predestin toate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us amen you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now I know and realizing I said I'll speak a little bit and then you get ready with your comments and questions and things but I know when realize that trying to drive things down hard you know to make it to where uh you will understand that I leave so many loopholes and uh problems of understanding and I was just thinking that you might think well well brother Dale doesn't make the the uh elect the bride of Christ uh the the great position uh you know that she should be I I differ with you I don't think that I've ever tried to do anything but make her to that position you know to give her to that place to where she would be able to stand upon God's word and and believe it and be what he wants us to be because you know that way it's not just putting us all on one level I believe in the elect I believe in The Bride of Jesus Christ as being the the greatest of all that's ever happened on the earth outside of the Lord Jesus Christ that's right because we are his people chosen of him to be who we are and there was in case you miss it and all I've tried to say there was some about you and I that God liked right you know right and that would move him toward us but then his calling would move us toward him right amen you know and I believe that I believe there's something about an individual an ability to believe maybe what was the difference in Abraham and anybody else that was in the world as far as a man he was just a man that's like everybody else but you know what he believed God sir when God said something he didn't have the Holy Ghost to believe with he had only his human ability with an anointing of God to be able to believe and he believed him right well you know and and see he had to believe when it looked impossible that's right and see that's why he's the father of faith is because he could believe a human mortal could believe God well if he could do that without the baptism of the Holy Ghost why can't you and I with the baptism of the Holy Ghost believe him when he says something just believe it and just go forth and confess it and believe it and say thank you Lord it's mine you know and then just March right on down the road thank you Jesus but the main thing is if he tells you something for you to believe remember that he expects you and I to walk in that that he's brought unto us he expects us to you know be what we're supposed to be that's right amen because we're his children that's right we're his offspring you remember the story of the uh the African slave you know that that he was always up and doing his job and even though he was a slave and away from his country he knew he was the son of a king and he still conducted himself that way well that's what we need to be and all like that we were talking kind of that line coming home last night that you know people are watching you and I to see we can make a great confession with our mouth we can expound upon the scriptures and confound the wise our children could tell the scholars and things things about the Bible that they don't even know but then are we going to say out of one side of our mouth something you know and not live that you remember I brought out that emphasized it that a fountain can't bring forth bitter and sweet it's going to be one or the other cuz it cannot do it and just remember we're not deceiving no one but ourselves you know in in our doing so just remember that see because I give all the praise the honor and glory to God Almighty for revealing his word to you and I I do that I hold that always have always pray Lord use me no matter what just use me toak bring your word no matter what I am and brother randam was talking about even uh Isaiah he's was talking about I was reading it the other day about how that he was just a man and just and said had faults and failures just like you and I have I said God chose him to write the word well you know why can't we believe it and be what we are okay let's cover a few things and then we'll get on to comments and questions and then carry on uh the word of the Lord remember brother forny will be with us on February the 5th which is a Wednesday preaching for us all right now I just tell you what I believe because that's the way I've always been when the prophet of God said we came here with his seed in us I believe that I just don't believe it maybe like everybody else seem or you know what a lot of people seem to believe I believe it was a seat of representation from predestination that even the little woman at the well there you know that's what she had she had representation and her representation was that she believed she believed her mother told her about these things she believed it her preacher told her about about you heard the little woman at well she said we know when the Messiah cometh so they were studying the scriptures looking forward to the coming of the Messiah right and that was quickened to her that he was the Messiah but that didn't give her eternal life he so the seed was quick and dinner well amen but it was a seed of what we know when the Messiah cometh I said about Moses it was Quicken to Moses at the burning bush that he was the deliverer amen that he was the one to go then all of his mama said came alive in his heart but he heard it from her all through the scriptures then you find them people believing it Mary believing of Isaiah 9 you know there a virgin shall conceive she believed that and when the angel began to talk to her about it she was well acquainted with that scripture her mother had taught her those things then she could say be it unto me according to Thy word because see I've tried my best to explain to you what is the seed of God God the seed of God is the revealed word for the hour that you're living go remember it's not the person 154 Church age book it's not the person that comes from God predestinated eternally amen it's the word are seed all right so then everything out here in the natural is purely the forn knowledge of God right if not what kind of a god do you have if he's not infinite all right then he could write in his word he could write it down he could speak of things that would be 6,000 years before they would transpire but see we want to try to pull us into a bracket or something to make us something super religious I believe that as I said a moment ago I don't believe there's anything on the earth greater than the Bride of Jesus Christ am that's that's a wonderful position that's the that's the son of a king that we could live and be that but you see at the same time he saw you and I he saw by his for knowledge what everybody else would do right he saw the foolish virgins would receive eternal life one day right he wrote about him in the word Matthew 25 he spoke of a sealed Jew people that would be given eternal life he spoke of 144,000 he spoke of a lot beside of you and I that would be given eternal life as far as he's concerned you already saw it you know the one scripture that you got to let it be divided by the prophet you know the scripture says enter in the joy voice of the Lord prepared for thee before the foundation of the world you know that's the bride all right but it's also got to be applied to the foolish virgins the Jews Etc you said well was a place provided for them well that's what he said because where the scriptures plac especially like Revelation 7 you're going on over there where the the Jews are at and see everything was made ready but the most wonderful part of it was to me now had it never been a fall then would those people have come into being that are going to be given eternal life or would have only been you and I as his offspring see they're going to say if you hadn't to come we wouldn't be here we're talking about a cup of water in thy name now that's not somebody say oh I'm going to make sure I'm good to them people cuz I can get you turn l no it's not that way no it's when it's done from a heart of just I'm going to do it you know somebody you have a flat tire somebody stop Happ you change the tire right they can get eternal life that's a wonderful thing right and why can't we believe it but you see I believe to have eternal life inside of here I have to be born again that's right I don't believe I came with the eternal life in me if I did as I st many times Jesus Christ never had to die right that's right he died in vain no but you see that seed then God looked down through and we'll cover more in some other m mes I know on it already the thoughts are there that you know there was a predestinated seed forever age that's right I believe that when Luther caught that of the just shall live by faith that wasn't an accident that wasn't somebody just reading the Bible Well I didn't know it said that no he had read it and read it and read it and read it spoke on it probably heard of others speak on it there were a lot of people protested the Catholic Church before Martin Luther right but they were not the predestinated seed to bring forth right so it didn't work but Luther it did but you understand then brother R said the seed was put there what Christ the mystery God revealed it was put there before the foundation of the world then that can only be in God's mind or else you have a pre-existence I believe in pre-existence of eternal life I don't believe in pre-existence of people I believe in pre-existence of God Amen and I believe that there was a time that he dwelt alone then where were you and I at then if he dwelt alone we would have to be a part of him the only thing then I can credit with being back dire before the world or credit to be a part of him is the fact that I have eternal life because he the only one Eternal see we used to believe there was two eternals you know what brother was bringing out last night I enjoyed it we you know we used to believe there's two eternals we believe we had eternal life and we believe there was going to be people in Hell Eternal you remember that we believed in two Eternal lives whether we want to agree with or not but you see then church I only believe that there's one eternal life right and if I have eternal life then that eternal life always was and always will be Eternal amen amen and that it's a part of God that would be to where that it would make me his offspring not this body here not this physical part this is the part I'm riding in but would make me that's inside of here an eternal God you said God well that's what the scripture says it makes them gods do whom the word come to he said yeah but how you going to tell well Jesus was a mortal being right the body was a mortal being right and died but he was raised up and made Eternal and the Bible said we'll have a body like under his glorious body so are we going to just stay IM mortal people no we're going to be an immortal people by chain that will come upon us and make us his children his offspring and if I'm a part of God not this but inside of here then I can believe the impossible sir you need that quote brother said God believes the impossible amen amen and if he's in you you'll believe it that's right CU it's not I Jesus said it's the father that dwelleth in me so it's not I it's not you it's the god that dwells in us that's what makes us his offspring you remember in one of the messages we picked it up see the real you who is the real you that person that can stand here with eternal life in their soul by the new birth that they've received that part of you in there is the real you this is just a tabernacle that I dwell in but one day it will be made La un to what's inside of it or eternal and when it is there's the real you the real you that would have come had it been no fall come on read spoken words Original Seed I'm pretty sure it's in there he said being born by word and spirit brings us back to the original like we should have been amen and did not been a fall wonderful message that we received amen see then the scripture says as we read this morning in Ephesians that we were chosen in him not just chosen off him that would make it a different situation totally to be chosen off him would be like you pick up sides you know I'll take this side and I'll do one over here one over here I one here one that's what we look at is choosing but no it doesn't say choosing it says we were chosen were before the foundation of the world where in him that's right all right then when he came here we were in him is that right not our fleshly beings not the person you're you're looking at that's right not even the Body Spirit soul of this man as a Samuel Dale but the eternal life that I have within me was a part of him and when he was chosen you and I were chosen amen so when he was predestinated now come on you truly believe he was around I was looking at I finally just took my notes I said I forget it I had them piled my wife wouldn't even touch them I had my whole desk just pile full of quotes I finally yesterday just took them everyone and said I'm going through this today and get through with it and then we'll go on and I throw it away probably two 200 pages of quotes I guess close to it it say 100 anyway and someone just put these away and we'll start from here you see I could have read it out and run on with it for 6 months still preaching on it and you know that but I chose to stop and then come back and just pick things for us to be able to follow along and and see cuz I want us to realize who we are you know you've heard me say many times I don't want my kids to be called a migil huies that wouldn't be my kids my kids are called Al you all right why because they're my Offspring see by the beding ground through the wife it is your that's what she's for she's to help you reproduce yourself because the germ comes from the male but without the female there ain't going to be no babies born sister Freda was telling us last night that the doctors told or the people in school told her that a man could carry a baby if they put the egg and sperm into his intestines or somewhere in his stomach or something whatever his abdomen abdomen okay abdomen I said they'll never put me to sleep again never have it Danny ain't going to put me to sleep again and if you go I'm going to be standing there but we ain't going to get this thing started you know remember they made a movie one time I didn't see it but I heard about it's a half pragnant man well I wonder what the other half was but listen do you believe brother random was saying about the uh the little woman I see how was the one coming across the desert and all he said she was predestinated well see I believe in predestination I believe everything in the world by for knowledge God predetermined it that he didn't have to think it over as it came down through he already knew so we could already write it down mhm that's right he could write down that Paul was going to be Saul you know and then he was going to turn into Paul he could write that down because he was almighty God that's right so then predestination to me is very simple it means god looked down through Saul said that's it that's what it's going to be all right see then get to point of listening then we'll get down to you get to if we were chosen in him and not of him in him all right then we were predestinated when he was predestinated you believe he was predestinated yes if you don't you sure got a lot of problems we surely do need about six more months on this if you don't believe Jesus Christ was predestinated what about being able to live through life now I'm honest I've always tried to tell you what I think I don't think Jesus because of him being connected to the Flesh and the way he was he didn't know everything because come on now he didn't know when he's coming back so you do argue all you want to yeah but he was God well that's all right God's in you do you know everything but yet he would come along and when he came along one day it was quickened to him he read the scripture of Isaiah 61 that's right and he seen Isaiah 61 was right there in his own life and he said this day this scripture is filled right amen but you think about it by him knowing that he knew also the horrible death that he would die because David had already in the spirit spoke of him as looking as a prophet called it l like a piece of hamburger meat you know shredded to pieces you know he knew what would happen what about knowing all of that and yet he never went around well tell you want wyny say Wy Wy wooy I've got a problem I got to be God again yes no he endured the cross the Bible says what far for you and I right so when he was chosen we were chosen when he was predestinated and it said there would be a lamb slain before the foundation of the world that wase determined to come into view one day but at the same time he was predetermined to be crucified why would he be crucified because it was predetermined that there would be a people who would desire salvation right amen do you follow it or else he couldn't be be predetermined to die if he's predetermined to die there was a reason for his dying right you and I would not be in existence in any form without him that's right right cuz surely by now that it is to blow the whole thing away that's right but yet he keeps it to that day you know they actually said I remember reading that when uh Einstein split the Adam he missed it by a h of the correct thing and if he'd hit that correctly it Blow the whole world up once they set it off that's how close just a higher off from as we'd call it dead center or whatever you'd want to do the terminologies it would have blowed the whole world to pieces now you know what the atom bomb is just a cap designator every how you say that word you know the thing that sets off you know what a cap is sets off a dynamite it's just a cap for the hydrogen bomb and the hydrogen bomb was in the ' 50s I after the Adam Bomb in the 40s what have they got now they can zap you totally out of being what you see it was predestinated that there'd be a people in this day that would believe this message right predetermined that would be the seat of God I just get the opportunity to believe I can be one of them we talk about being you know born again well all right but in this age it's not just predestinated to a new birth it's predestinated on into to adoption on into to a change of the body amen you know what's keeping off the change of the body your Prophet said you and I that's right that's right right you need that quote he said you're an hour keeping it from happening why because we're not believing correctly Who We Are right oh yeah we're believing you right over here to this church right across over here and they're preaching about they believe who they are they're reading the same book you read and they're claiming to be The Offspring of God what's the difference well they don't believe the message is hour well like brother brother said he said who knows Jacqueline Kennedy you remember he talking about the Waterhead ha cutter I mean h do or whatever he called her he said if she'd have heard the message right might be a difference but the problem is church we have heard the message that's right amen amen now what are we going to do with it I wasn't joking when I said we'd have the next it won't be long until we've been having Fellowship meetings in the nursing home right right and a lot of us sitting here that's close to it kids had already said they're riding up down terance especially riding up down the road trying to find a good one for us I don't know where he's trying to find a good one or the cheapest one I haven't figured it out yet or the goodest one that's the cheapest you know but it's no joke really we're one breath that's right from any kind of a problem that it could exist right disease is coming on the earth now that they don't know what to do they don't know what they they don't even know what they are now wasn't that what the prophet said he said one day cancer will be like a toothache and look what they're doing just experimenting someone we talking last night about this lady or girl or something that they gave her a flu shot and now it's just thred her into all kind of things she can't walk forward they don't understand but she can walk backward all kind of things is wrong just because of a little shot that you know you said well I took one of them should I be worried are you walking backwards or forward okay you start walking backwards and can't walk forward I would suggest going to the doctor Brother D you're crazy I agree with you but that's just the way I live folks I live with no fear no thoughts of what can come because you know what it will come that God predestinated by his full knowledge just as well as anything else yeah but through all this 36 you just had made me feel uplifted I'm sorry I tried because I'm trying my best get you to see and me to see what God thinks about us he spoke there in Revelation and said and his wife he calls her bride and what brother R said I'll call you bride he talks of a bride talks of a girlfriend Revelation he said and the wife has made herself ready amen that's right I've never tried to be but one thing and that's try to preach whatever that I believe was needful for the time to try to help us and get us prepared because I've believed since brother Mo preached the statute of perfect man there in 71 or two in there in both years and I asked him I said brother mod all I want to know is how do I get these virtues well it was about 1980 the Lord spoke to me and said it can only be brought by the revealed word you you can't practice to get Faith you you can't uh beat each other to get patience or temper is or anything it can only be by the revealed word and see then I gave you the quotes while we're in the series of it that or gave you the quote there especially that these young ministers he said would sweep this on to the coming of the Lord I didn't say that I didn't say in the stature of a perfect man that it take a fivefold Ministry for the perfecting of the Saints for the bringing of these virtues into the people I didn't write that but I believe it amen cuz you see I have to have a pastor well you mean preachers got have pastors he he's the first one's going to be looking for one because you're depending on somebody to try to help you you say yeah but but it don't make no difference brother wouldbe used to have a good point it really was good he said a little woman with the Holy Ghost can help you if you'll listen to her what will it be who'll be the first one what kind of questions thoughts comments but make sure that you you know we will try to cut it as slow as we can and keep it into the line and you'll have to get us a a microphone or something to take to the people and you know who be first who's got a question don't comment sister sister Anna Romans 82932 those who he forew he also did predestinate to be conformed did God for know everyone and everything in the world and if so it means he forew Sinners too and did he predestinate Sinners to Eternal damnation all right he knowed all things he knew who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved uh by him knowing who would be saved who would want to be saved and who wouldn't want to be saved now uh there ain't nobody in the world let me let me straighten that part up just in a hurry there ain't nobody in the world that tell you they don't want to be saved you you understand that's just wordings it's not something that don't want to be saved it's some reason that for them not wanting you know not accepting what you bring all right so everybody is predestinated by God's fulln knowledge but nobody is predestinated by his predetermining Factor without giving him a choice that's right even as we would talk about someone in a foreign country um hot and toot back in the jungle somewhere I'm so glad the prophet came to show us those things he said they'll be judged according to the laws of their own tribe that's right ain't that something something God knew that nobody would ever be able to take the word to them right you know he would judge them about how they live by their own tribes rules that's right and he said that's why you see there's not any venial diseases now this is way back right veneral diseases developed in a lot of countries because of um sorry say uh from monkeys in other words women receiving animals and that order to show you it started in there but that was Vanilla diseases in a lot of the foreign countries when brother Brandon was there he didn't see anything why because they were good people they lived according to a code of ethics we would call it to be good people it's the moral obligation of any human being no matter who to be good and to want to serve God so he never made nobody lost but he knew who would be and who wouldn't is that what you're talking about okay that clear it up like sister said today something she said Brother D I saw something there like I said it was as clear as mud she started laughing cuz she'd never heard that saying that's saying with us around here you know somebody one time said I said is that clear he said well it's clear as mud which mean he didn't fully understand it but you know what to do all right who'll be next somebody make a comment about what you believe sister Trudy in the back behind sister Trudy um I just want to try to see if I understand what you have been preaching all this time now when we talk about the woman at the well and we said that her seed came alive or her seed was quickened I understand that she didn't receive the new bread because she was talking to the Messiah at that point in time now is that seed the revelation of who she was talking to and then it was leading up to her receiving the new birth and does that same thing applies to Mary cuz they both like you said they both heard the word right so it was God's predestinated thought then it became their thought because they heard it mhm and when it was in front of them they accepted it okay so that's basically what you you were saying right okay now coming down to our time or yeah our time we pass Calvary so the same process applies for us um is just that the new birth is what we will receive once we have that revelation of who Jesus Christ is and who we are so it's like a moving a progressing exactly okay cuz see I I believe that you need to know who he is before you can know anything about a new birth right so at that time when we get or let me say when I have that revelation of who he is and it became my thought after I confess it that is the quickening word or the the seed exactly God seed okay that's Romans see where with the heart you believe the mouth you confess okay you got to believe it confess but how can you believe something that you don't know anything about see so you well stated it the woman at the wh her knowledge was of who he was he was the Messiah he did not birth that into her as to give her the Holy Ghost but you know what that took her to the day she received the new birth that took her to Upper Room as we call it and then she received eternal life go that way Faith first comes by hearing you must hear it you must believe it the disciples it speaks of them in The Parables and it speaks of them it says and they took the word and held it it emphasizes they held it cuz some was scattered on ground thorns and thistles and rocks and but some of them took them took it and held it they said to Jesus one day he said what we don't know why don't you go to he said that 7 left they said well we don't know where to go cuz thou Hast the words of eternal life you're the only one that's got a message worth fooling with and we don't understand but we might as well to stay here right right I have one more question okay um does representation leads to Redemption because like the woman that the well she had a knowledge she had something there represent and say hey this is what I recognize and I will stand by what I heard so that leads to redemption or exactly okay because your representation you must have that first right before you could even speak of being redeemed I mean you can't even cover being redeemed Until you realize you know what you're redeemed from and how you're redeemed and what it takes place that you must be born again and the soul is redeemed but it's not the finish of all of it so then to just say you know I always was so I'm redeemed no is a revelation everything we get from God must come by faith you agree with that a revelation from God that's right so you can carry it all you want to you can read this book all you want to until it's revealed like sister f I think was talking about last night she was explaining serpent seed or something to somebody and it was made a to her what she was explaining you ever had that you're explaining it you know and all that once is Made Alive you wow you know but it's got to be made known it's got to be revealed and for it to be revealed means God's got to speak to you first of thought now you let Satan come and take that thought and twist it he can can't birth that thought even though he brought it everybody understand that point he can't birth something that you let be perverted in your thinking that's right he would be quickening a lie wrong thing so when you read something believe it that's right he was wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity by stripes we are healed you know what I believe that you know what I believe you want thus sayith the Lord that's what it says thus sayth the Lord he was wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity by Stripes from heal come on that's him but if that's not revealed I'll stay sick and even sometimes when it's revealed I don't immediately receive what I'm confessing you agree with that amen I've got to confess it let him do it anything else that's it okay who'll be next sister hand it up to Sister Trudy we got two Trudy so I don't like they do it around here they say black Trudy white Trudy well that they're okay with it but you know it's Trudy Mac and Trudy T yeah um Anna had mentioned something last week I think it was and I don't know that she ever said anything to you but it's perfect uh these people who say that they came here with something in them and they feel they were always Eternal then they should always be healed yeah that was the point she brought out so good point the sick ones it's all so so we know who the sick ones are or something how they pronounce that word Zozo or something like that which means redeemed physically or redeemed spirit save physically or sa and if you if you always was eternal then why are you sick that's right so evidently Jesus's body wasn't Eternal that's right cuz he is sick right he Gran with a headache right see his body was not Eternal it was made Eternal in the resurrection because it was a creation you can't create anything Eternal he never created eternal life brother Dale God created no he didn't create eternal life eternal life is the creator he's the Creator go ahead I had a a verse that I wanted to ask a question about it's uh Hebrews uh 1113 but to which of the the angel said he at any time sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stol are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be Heirs of Salvation exactly um is that now Paul is speaking there back then about us today but could we we too can include our families that are lost now not if it's revealed to you yeah okay I say that with all respect everything if it's revealed to you you can say it for your family if it's not keep saying it until it's revealed keep saying it until it becomes a reality but just because you say it I got in trouble trying to explain that years ago and the Brethren were saying you mean to tell me your kids is going to be Eternal just because they're your kids I said you have missed all in the world I've tried my best to explain to you I said when God said Wade would be saved I said it behind him he gave it first I said then I confess what he confesses well how do you know the difference brother Dale well we find out whether it takes place or not right we go believe it but see the main thing is then what do we do we must live our confession right if we don't live before our kids what we confess how what do we want them redeemed to we just want them took out of the pets of the hell of the world and brought up into a little better standard of life right we want them to quit drugs quit drinking quit smoking quit run running around quit all we want them just to quit that to come up to a greater height than life that's not my goal for my kids right my kids have got a problem cuz I got a goal for them and until that goal is finished they going to have to do it I used to tell June even I said I'd look at weight in the life not laugh like funny laugh and look at him and say boy you got a hard road but you're coming I believe it and I confess it then what I do try my best to live before them as to show them what I want them redeemed too right I want them to be brought to work that I am and then that's a horrible place I agree cuz maybe they won't stop where I am and they'll go on into Greater Heights because I know and realize the state I'm in is not too good but I just don't want them to quit drinking smoking chewing and stuff like that Alcoholics Anonymous just send them down there that'll take care of it they'll work with them and it'll work so I get to preaching okay who's next s Anna this is for last Sunday um you said and I saw that you can have a revelation without the new birth right and I did realized Caiaphas prophesied um Peter also say thou the Christ exactly and people all over the world are healed what is the difference and yet faith is a revelation right and the new birth is the re revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you right what is the difference with all those Revelations because one of them is a the the the Revelation which is a new birth is a person it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you but it is a person it's not just a thought it's a person coming and living in you the new birth whereas the other one is a confession upon the basis of what you believe and I looked you know and I remember I gave it to other day uh looking in your computers faith for the time a little woman that when Jesus went by I believe when he I'm pretty sure she reached out and touched him brother said she had faith for the time what does that mean that meant she got healed that didn't mean she got saved right that's one I've tried to express through this message part that people thinks because something was quickened to you or it was quickened to you that brother R was a prophet that's right that you know you're saved no let me quote the Bible have you you received the Holy Ghost what since it was quickened unto you that brother R was a prophet you mind if I say it that way because that's the way brother Randon was saying it he said in other words you say you know I believe it he said all right but have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed I thought I got it when to believe that's a good Baptist Doctrine that's not scripture anymore okay there was a quote we read last Sunday that if you are in God's thinking that's the only way you can have eternal life exactly yet God knew everybody exactly and they were in his thinking mhm but they don't have eternal right so you remember when I was in the message there I was talking about I said we say uh all I want to do is make sure I'm in God's thinking Judas was in his thinking at the same time Jesus was in his thinking as to die on Calvary Judas is garrot was in his thinking but that didn't give Judas is garrot eternal life you remember the point I kept trying to make maybe it's a carnal way to see it but it's what I believe there's a lot of difference in what God has thinking of or has thought of and to be a part of him his own thinking you remember I said I don't want to be a thought in God's mind because he might have thought of me going to hell cuz he did of Judas but if I'm part of him then I have eternal life and he can't go to hell eternal life can't go it's done paid the price we see then that's a vast difference between saying and that's what I emphasizing the little woman faith for the time around the world today there's people being healed right you know maybe that are not even in church brother Brandon said them Jews are being healed every day and don't even believe in Jesus Christ what is it Faith what simply is faith maybe we need a six months discussion of that but what simply is Faith it starts first by your mental believing Abraham didn't have the Holy Ghost to believe with he mentally believed it what I like about God is if you will mentally believe something take my word he'll come on the scene to you now start with Abraham just said I believe it but remember something was talking to him that something that was talking to him wound up one day to meet him the more contact he had with that person the more he realized who that was brother rown said that voice that I heard when I was a little boy telling me not to smoke or drink it'd be a work for me he said that was that same voice the first time he met that angel he said I know that voice go it was so personal faith then starts simply by believing the prophet said to right mental attitude toward any promise will bring it to pass Faith he said is so simple he said until a prostitute or a sinner come across the platform be prayed for and be healed he said a true sinner prayed for and failed get it a true Christian not a true Center true Christian fail to get what they're asking for when a sinner could receive it you see why some people will never be saved they can't believe I told you that man out there said oh they didn't told Brother Mo said why they didn't go out they didn't go to no moon they just up up went down out there in that desert somewhere they didn't go to no moon there's no way to convince him you remember the one to brother randam said I don't believe no matter what you do what did he say he said it wouldn't far you you can't believe if the right men latitude will bring God on their s why don't we at least start saying it that's right that's I live through a lot of things in this message and I've lived through a lot of churches that and heard this preach and you have too well let's just confess it I agree with that 100% but those in that situation they started confessing it or no longer here so it never went on to a revelation it's only a head knowledge vast difference between the head knowledge heart knowledge I like what somebody said said Lord let that drop about 18 Ines you know from up here down into here I wish I had down in my heart what is in my head it's believing steps what you're talking about there in Romans 8:28 I find that for me I want to make it too hard or me too sorry or something like I've been told all these years by the devil but all we've got to do is look at what God says we can have right get the sin and all out of our life get the flu cleaned out and say Lord I accept it bring it on I I that was the I remember from the first time I reckon I ever read statue of a perfect man one of the things that impressed me the strongest in there was brother Brenham says it's God's obligation to bring you up through this not yours to get up through it it's your yours to yield to him but it's his responsibility to get you through it and I think that's I'm speaking for me now not nobody else just me but I think we everyone need to guard against saying well I'm just not good enough for that I'm just not this or I'm not that or I'm not the other if I made a decision to serve Jesus Christ and he has accepted my decision and given me the baptism of the Holy Ghost then there's not a thing there that I can't have if I just get right before him exactly you just keep confessing exactly I believe we're going to have to say that we're already changed and then it can take place but not lip service that's what I was talking about while to go now minute there I heard a lot of people say let's go let's just let's just say it the prophet said let's say it well they never kept leaving their confession there only lip service who be next anybody else comments questions thoughts sister Freda wait a look get we want t on tape because that people out you are listening um when we're born as babies we're born with our souls yeah okay um brother brandom said that we hear from our theophany and brother Bram said our soul is our theophany and when we receive the Holy Ghost we hear from our theophany can you explain I mean we're born with that soul and our soul is our theophany so how is it I mean how do we hear from our theophany right so then the word soul theophany I tried to express to you as much as I know and clear as I could make it when a baby's born it's born to baby it's Body Spirit and soul born in Satan's domain lost the soul is there what is that soul that is that being or the person of that child of what it is but by not having eternal life where is it going the word theophan means the body of a deity is the break down the definition so then who was on the throne in our heart when we were first born by being born in Satan's domain Satan was right not a person there sitting there like a devil it's our soul our being but the nature of it is perverted that's right into the wrong thing the wrong way and brother Brown said that devil hanging there was what caused me not to be saved gave it a couple of weeks ago what he said that devil sitting there me caused me to not be saved when I was 12 years old you know he's talking about himself so then a sinner anybody has a soul right any person that has a soul or don't have a soul that is a soul that's a better way of saying a person is a soul the nature of that is going downward he said and there were souls in prison which were in hell because they repented not see all right so that's your soul that's your being the nature of that is the devil CU he can't create a soul he perverts the nature of the soul and makes it of his nature his ways but the prophet said then when we become born again he said we start turning upward see now he's using there two times that he used theop three times that he use theophany as speaking of a sinner the rest of the time he's speaking of of a upward occurrent you know going upward and that way when you're born again it's not your soul that died that's right right or you'd be dead it was the nature of it right the thing that Satan had perverted you made you into a certain nature he said those Fallen Angels is hanging around he said and they give you a nature what he said but then when you're born again then you hear from that God is drawing you just like the statue of a perfect man I believe you're born again at Faith The Headstone is what's pulling you longing to bring it forth so that way your soul is you the offy now he but said we bypast Earth theophany come in the world be tempted now what's he talking about when he said your soul was your theophany and who is this meled he said you bypassed he said you never come like Jesus he said you come like me lost all see Jesus came if you just listen read who is this m chest Jesus came in a word body right before the world ever begun not Jesus the flesh Jesus the Christ the son of God the logos the theop that went out of God which was God in another form the prophet said and see then when that happened he was word body you and I bypass a word body we still Ste In the Flesh to be tempted he said we become the word here and he's explaining the the difference between a person that's resurrected he said their soul is loose come the spirit Spirit to the body they stand up he said but not so for us here he said here we take this body to meet the theophany what's he meaning we take it to the word it becomes the word here we don't become the word when we get to heaven we better become it here then we can go to heaven so then your soul is your theophany right because it's who you are and whoever's on that Throne is what's ruling it when you start in that new birth and that's why it takes justification same to drive that thing out of there future home read it 1516 future home drives it out where that Holy Ghost can come in and live now you got something positive but you ain't complete yet you only have the earnest of your inheritance that's right you only have the earnest of the Holy Ghost I thought I you got the person of Jesus Christ but it's in a baby form what else can you call it you're a baby and it's a baby as it grows you grow until we must become the word here so then we're not going to heaven to be made Eternal it's right here right are we ain't going to heaven you see what I'm talking about if you don't say I don't see what you're talking about are you saying that when we receive the Holy Ghost I mean you said when we're born that the devil I mean we that's the nature he pervert your nature of your soul but when you receive the Holy Ghost then and you start upward is it that the nature nature of the Holy Ghost draw just comes in you and draws you upward your on your theophany mhm cuz that's the positive okay the throne or whatever it says if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting but you know what somebody is not going to die that's right so it's got to come here come on Jesus was made Eternal here not Eternal up there he went through his here so uh well we going to make some way for them too talking about bride we ain't making way for nobody he made a way anybody else he maybe I can get away from holling and screaming but sister Trudy wants with what Freda was talking about I I remember brother Brandon when he had that vision and uh he saw Sharon Rose who died when she was what8 months or and yet he didn't recognize her because she was a grown woman right so when a baby dies or anybody younger than an adult of in of adult stature they automatically get their grown body and the Saints under the altar are they still in the position of just having the uh the earnest because they're not changed yet they're not in a glorified State uh those you talking about the true bride that's died going on yes that's a one I personally say I don't understand uh but I do know one thing for sure they are Eternal those that He Saw beyond the curtain of time were full grown people that were there in theophany and that was not just an earnest to them it was to fullness see and in comparing it Luther's justification just an Earnest to what we have but yet still his Earnest was his fullness right there was nothing to be added to Luther we don't raise him up and add something to him when brother R saw those beyond the curtain of time they were in their fullness for what they were or the day they were living anything else so when a baby dies and it gets that adult theophany is everybody that's under the alar Sharon Rose included right she's under the altar isn't she MH um are they all on the same level the very same level in Revelation I guess would be the question I have now you you got to remember and this is not making because she was part of brother brandham but yet there is a more truth to him in talking about her than I believe that it's an average person I'm I'm honest if you don't like those statements that's all right with me uh but see Sharon Rose when he saw her she was in a full-grown woman uh when she died she was a baby you remember and she was talking to him about telling him what would take place you know Billy's down here we go do this or that the other uh remember now that's the child of a prophet that I'm not trying to make that that other people are secondary but I don't put every soul of every baby in the same place uh just no more than I put because you say you're a Christian in the same place there's foolish virgins that died and went on you can't put them nowhere but in the sixth Dimension all right but evidently in that sixth Dimension there are sections or something know how you want to explain it uh you know this group is not with this group and see if that's baby is there now the baby the baby doesn't have eternal life the baby that's died just a baby that's died doesn't automatically go to eternal life it would have to go to a position of holding but it would not automatic even though all babies go to heaven that's what we want to think but does it go to heaven with eternal life or does it go to a positional position to wait until a time that when others can be brought forth CU if you ain't careful see then you'll just make everybody that dies a baby underage they automatically go into eternal life no that you're getting a little I think that's going a little too far I'm honest and there's degrees in heaven there's going to be rulers in heaven there's going to be servants in heaven and I think there's going to be degrees I think there are degrees of where when a baby dies that the baby goes and it's somewhere and it soul is somewhere but it's not complete because its body is still down here so then don't make it eternal I said now there is a situation there brother around his child you're getting into a we call it a gray area but uh it's an area of knowing that it was his child not a specialty but I don't see I don't put every baby that di say baby die right now I don't say that it steps over into eternal life but it does go somewhere cuz remember all foolish virgins that do not have eternal life right they're not giving eternal life when they die they've got to go to the white Throne well now I'm going through see the baby that dies under the age of accountability don't have to go to the white Throne right I don't believe that now because I don't believe they go to the white throne but I believe they're in with they're withholding from a position of going forth until you know something can happen in the end of all things now brother randam says that those fifth seal Jews will give be given eternal life under the seventh seal that's what he says that's a direct quote do they have it now no I believe they're in a holding Place hard words don't have no education they're in a position a place and it would have to be in the sixth Dimension cuz they can't put them in the fifth that's too much Catholicism to put them in the fifth and try to draw them out to put them up into the sixth that's Catholicism remember everybody goes to hell they got to come out I don't believe that I believe the Fifth Dimension the prophet said is the cner dead but I don't believe babies have to go to a center dead position but they can't go to a completed position I still believe and all of that waiting on you and I the day without us cannot be made perfect we're doing the pulling folks it's that what you talking about what I still find hard to understand is how and I this is very childish and I'm sorry but brother brandom God took a picture of everybody at a certain age Sharon Rose never came to that point on Earth yeah and I don't understand how God would know what she would be like except that he's omniscient so he would know what I I have no problem with him knowing what she look like I don't no problem with that because if he could see what I would be you know I have no problem with him being able to see what she would look like because I believe he knows what every one of them babies that died would look like had to reach that age now just because he didn't take the picture and really basically if you get down to it the picture was made before the world in God's mind the picture of who' be lost a picture who' be saved the things brother randam is emphasizing if you'll notice he doesn't say when you're born again he says when you come up to about 18 20 years of age set a pictures take he's emphasizing a natural situ situation a natural person standing looking a pictures taken he said god holds that cuz you're going to return to that so he's not really discussing salvation that's what I say to me the discussion of Salvation would go before the foundation of the world God knew in his mind what you and I would look like how many people would be here whether or not we would accept him as our savior he know all about it and he was able to write down her name is able to tell who's going to be there and that's what the brother said last night that anybody that wouldn't bride in the future home would be there in a mortal body of some form he said I don't agree with that uh-uh anybody in that future home is going to be Eternal right why because the scripture says I make all things new you said well why can't you just leave them mortal what do you want to leave a mortal for what's your problem what do you want them to be mortal where you can look down at them you mortal I'm Immortal no go ahead we got anybody else I just to okay thank you thank you that's good like the old saying goes about you know you don't ask you questions now forever hold your peace cuz you have an opportunity that's the one thing I think I'm honest and I think you'll agree I don't think that most ministers open up to allow you to question them about what to say right but you're welcome to it anytime with me why because number one if you don't understand what I'm talking about if you don't tell me I'm not a prophet I can't discern you out I may pick out as I said this morning I may pick out there's something wrong with you right my brother Ray the other day is walked around here all day long I walk to him later I said what your problem you ain't shook my hand yet he look back me he you didn't Shake mine either we both had a gripe right didn't mean anything let stand musicians you want to come we'll sing it's about 3 minutes after 4 I figured we'd be a little lengthy today but I just pray that if you have questions if you go back through these tapes and listen to the series I've tried to do and if you need help and you say well brother Dale which message did you preach etc etc etc and I I do have that's what Richard likes uh Richard took all of the tapes from what 82 something like that when we started with the cassettes and he was bringing them up when sometimes he would run into a name change that didn't work and he'd say here we've got this is written on the tape there so and so but that don't match the date here we'll see I do keep all of my notes and if you'll notice right down here it says series from the series of predestination it begin not the message but this new book begin 124 2013 on a Wednesday I keep a perfect record of all of my services and you ever want to know so well brother Dale where did you preach about uh the mind of God it'll take me a little while but I'll find it why N I try to be a smart elic I realize that sometimes we don't remember so I date it part one part two part three
