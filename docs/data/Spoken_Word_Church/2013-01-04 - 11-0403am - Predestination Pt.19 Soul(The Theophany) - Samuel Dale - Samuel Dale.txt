cattle and over all of the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god made so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them you may be seated the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now i know that a lot of times i do a lot of reading and i do a lot of of uh giving you a lot of quotes for you to read sometimes i preach without reading them i just scan down and pick up the thought and that's fine but see i want you to know what the prophet said but in that way it's not what brother dale says and then you don't worry and wonder well now i wonder did brother brown say it that way i'll just give you the quotes and let you read it and that'll take care of it or that you can can say well at least he read to us and you know what was being said but now we had a wonderful time last night in the uh bible study and paul and we just appreciate everybody coming we were talking about the fivefold ministry and uh you know the things and and doing and uh you know i really enjoyed it myself of course i get to do it become like some things i get to do a lot of talking and but we do have questions and answers we do you know but we don't take that part of the service uh we did last night for sister trudy brother uh joe some ways gonna send it to her i guess or copy it for her to listen later because she wanted to do it she's in trinidad and her haiti which one i always forget but anyhow she's somewhere that's i can't remember all those countries but now i've been trying for the past couple of services especially now to talk to you about uh this you because you know everybody says oh well now we we know this and we know that but do you really know do you really know yourself come on brother do you really know what you are right i mean do you uh you know do you could ever consider that or just well i'm just here no we're here for a purpose and i believe we need to know more about ourselves in this hour than ever before because here we are coming to the end of all things and see you say well now i need to know about salvation well that's good we're going to get to that don't worry about it but how do you know what salvation is if you don't even know what you are well we know what we are we're trying to be and we're body spirits all over this and yeah but do you really know about yourself come on do you really understand yourself do you understand what makes you work and and tick and do and why you're like you are come on they you know do we really have that in understanding right now but i've been dealing with a past couple of services especially with just talking about an individual you know you me people a person and what a person really is and and even a fallen in a fallen estate that's right even in a fallen estate there is no animal on the earth like man amen that's right there there is no animal that can do even though we know the story of what happened in genesis and how that there was a uh uh a creature there that was uh just like a man right but what was the prophet said the difference between him what was the thing that the beast didn't have he didn't have a soul all right but yet he was an upright creature looked exactly like mankind maybe bigger as the prophet would say uh etc uh i don't look at that as you know even the people of the message they begin to seem to to want to be so spiritual but i don't look at the beast as being a great big hairy looking monkey i don't you know the monkeys got his place and man was made you know uh the the beast was made it was a a a an upright creature and and then the curse is what put it on on its belly to crawl and and that's what happened in the garden then to to cause the the problem you know that right uh the beast was used in a vicarious form as the prophet would call it right but see he didn't have a soul because that was the problem with the with the old testament that the animal life could not come back upon the human to be able to do it only covering us right right see until jesus come and and you think about it now uh in the beast line was it only just one i'm not making no doctrine i'm just talking all right was it just one beast now if it was a species like the other species then evidently they might have been more you know there might have been a good many of the the beast lineage you know and they would have been a male and a female in that beef lineage or you you left out something somewhere that's right my point is why couldn't god then have kept that beast and made him an offering he looked just like the man never thought of that look just like a man why couldn't he kept him and made him an offering because he didn't have a soul so it wouldn't have brought no you know would have done no god he was an animal all right then we're nothing out here but an animal right right that's what we are we're just an animal but god gave us a soul amen and that soul then even though it and i've kept trying to play make it down on the level of not even bringing it to salvation and a little bit we'll pick up into more into the line of the redeemed and talk about it but i've been trying to get you to just think natural you know to get a line up of of what a person is that you know like brother branham would say even in our fallen mistake we're little creators he said the bird builds its nest i know the animals adapt and i know there's a certain amount of reasoning form to an animal in the basis of of abilities but not like the human being it's not that form there it's in a different way to where it is because you can train an animal but now if you leave that animal alone it's going to build its nest the same way but if you go cut down all the trees it's going to build its nest in your house that's right right right but it's still going to build its nest obviously it's just a form of animals all right but the human being has creator ability subject to even the supernatural until the bible said that they would have to put them out of the garden because there was nothing that uh you know the imagination of man's heart it was continually evil right and there was nothing that would be withholding from the man look at what we went through in in just your lifetime right right we went from 9 70 years old you know from from a horse and buggy to go to church and and be one or two cars and a whole bunch of wagons sitting around the church you know and and from that to a you know interplanetary travel of actually going into space and and all of the things that's happening here in life that seemingly like i said the other day you know they take this monofilament they call it and they run this thing all the way out in california and there's ten thousand thousand phone calls going through that one thing and they're not crossing each other right and around the world instantly you can just dial right now and there's no delay used to be a little delay you know if you remember that you would you would call somewhere and there's a little delay in the speech and you still see it sometimes on your newsreel so you know what i'm talking about that you'll see the guy's mouth moving and then his words there's a little delay all right but it's not that away now it's always just instant all right you should talk anywhere in the world whoever thought we could do that right whoever thought that mankind would come to the place that those two prophets one day will lay in the streets of jerusalem and the whole world will be able to see them that's right right the whole world will be able to see them too laying there it don't have to be a time delay it'll be interesting that you can see it maybe a different time over here and what it is over there yeah but still you can see it now you see what i'm talking about that even in the fallen estate of mankind see god had to put us out of the garden because once the fall came and you brought the person into a sinful condition then naturally satan would be you know would come into to a dealing and there would be nothing refrain from us so he had to put us out but in that fallen mistake now that's what i've been trying to get you to see i know the human being consists of a body spirit and soul we know that i mean that's understandable but that's a unit of you that we live here the in a unit form but what's the real you which ones are most important which one is god dealing with trying to save right you're not trying to save your body and we don't believe in getting a new one no we believe this body will be redeemed because that's price 49 of the future home amen prophet said your soul is redeemed waiting the redemption of the body all right we believe that but which is the most important part of you which is the part that got lost it wasn't your body that got lost it just follows that line like that see the body without the spirit is dead i mean you you know you you see and that soul that's within us is the part that god is working on to try to bring to salvation because he must begin with the inner part of us amen all right and then that soul is what that that we covered and we gave you the quotes back on it but the part that we covered there that even a fallen condition you have a celestial body right right a place to go to it's the regions of the lost right brother around said whether you want to believe this up here or down there whatever he said if it's not saved it's going down exactly but it's a place to go to and what is that that you're talking about we only think about beyond the curtain of time and even in that people don't want to talk about that brother around saw those there and the angel of the lord referred to the scripture souls under the altar right but we want to talk about this that or the other somewhere instead of really seeing and here's brother branham the body laying on the bed now was he dead when he went beyond the curtain of time no the soul didn't leave the body like leaving it as a point of going out of it it's just the way that you speak in forms that you use to try to express what you're talking about because once man that we know we're body spirit soul but once man failed god begin in that soul part of man to try to bring us to the place of salvation right see then that was the part that needed the covering in the old testament was the soul of the individual david would cry out you know and say lord my soul thirst just after thee because that was the real david right but you see outside of you is not what god is dealing with he's dealing from the inside of you because if if the inside can get saved the outside's going to somewhere come under subjection or have to be laid down go by the grave come up and and everything and be changed all right we see all people then that's what it says in ezekiel 18 4c all souls are mine that's right satan can't create a soul i know the two soul doctrines and the things that was said that satan gave your soul and god gave your soul now where's that in the mission that's right now run around said satan perverted the nature of your soul right amen that's right then when you did people say well a soul just a natural spirit now they need my quote for that that's right now the quote is the soul is the nature of the spirit amen there's no quote it says the soul is just the nature of the spirit because see that was the way they was quoting and i told them then that was incorrect what they were doing but my point of what i want you to see is that even in the fallen estate we are subject to supernatural things we're subject to to uh creative abilities see in that part because of the soul right but our soul is not eternal you must receive the new birth before it's eternal i know all of the quotes all of the things we done been through it this is message number 19 on predestination so we've done been through all of that where brother brown said if you have eternal life that's right then you always was eternal right what if you have it right that's right well i come into the world eternal life you don't need jesus that's right that's right you just need a good shot right between the eyes and take you out of the world you know i'm carnal but there's one thing about it it gets to point across you know what i'm talking about you don't have to go away and say i don't know what brother dale means you know what i mean i tell you what i mean that's right whether you like it or whether i even like it i say it now see when you were birthed from your mother then is when brother brown says life comes in that's right the wiggling muscles in there is just like an animal right all animals in the wound is the same way us and all rest the soul's not in there i don't care what mankind says we know what the prophet says all right he said when that life then when the baby is dropped from the mother and then god breathes the breath of life into the person see or puts the soul and spirit within the body that has been dropped from mother then you become a living soul now that's not using it as an eternal soul that's right because if you had an eternal soul what do you need jesus to come and die for see then you have all mankind having to be deal with and i don't believe it i believe you must receive eternal life all right but once you receive it the eternal life that you have always was eternal that's why over in john it said the seed remain opinion you cannot sin now the prophet said we were talking a while ago down everybody brought around said christians the only one who can sin now what's he saying but the bible says the seed remaineth in you and it cannot what the seed can't sing amen that's right right you and i could still do wrong brother brown do you sin he said every day no that's his words we don't like to quote those things we want to we want to make everything you know goody two shoes over on his side you know but he didn't want to make it that way he told it like it was he said i was born a hybrid but we don't like them folks these people can quote a lot of quotes but they they don't like all of them together all right but now trying to get over to a point where you can just understand see then we saw as i said that when we die as a natural person without not talking about salvation yet now as a natural person when we die there's a part of us go somewhere to wait we know the body goes to the grave rotten whatever you want to do with it they can preserve it now but you know but the soul lives on somewhere that's right so it's in one of the regions it's either under the fifth dimension which is the center dead or it's under the sixth dimension which is more or less the christian that has died you know all right so we have a place to go and what goes there the soul right amen that's right what did jesus do i gave it to you there on the trolls in prison jesus went to hell and preached the prophet said to souls that were in prison i know the bible what it says it says spirits but you cannot if you can't differentiate and write you pronouncing the old words between soul and spirit in your natural reading of the bible because it overlaps itself so much that's why it took brother branham all of those years because you know yourself what i've said is true basically up until 1962 on the greatest battle ever fought i said basically listen brother random talk body soul spirit see that's where you two soul people come along said you get a new soul right the bible doesn't say that so the bible says you get a new spirit all right the ezekiel that's right what is it 35 or what is it somebody help me in there 35 36 or something where i give you a new heart to your spirit now watch what i'm saying see up until that time even brother branham would would lay those things backwards and forth and seemingly not being able to have a clear understanding well that would be perfectly with hebrews 4 12. that the word of god as it would open to the prophet would let him discern between spirit and soul but then after the greatest battle ever fall if you're watching he'll go this way that way in that message but then after then he begins to bring it body spirit soul but here's the point you say well he never did preach it brother dale he didn't have to preach it over because he always gave the outside man the body he gave it five senses seek taste fill smell here all right the second realm of man whether you want to call it soul or spirit the second realm of man has memory reason conscious affection what's the other love imagination all right but the center part of man he only gave it one sense it's not faith and doubt see that would be the two soul doctrines that would put god and the devil together and my bible said god won't dwell in an unclean vessel now you can do what you want to i'm not against anybody i'm just tell it like it is they sure tell me like it is tell me they don't agree with me that's all right i don't have no problem with it you can leave your big toes god just don't ask me to kiss it i'm not going to worship the thing but you do what you want to because you're a human mortal like it's where the constitution gives you that right now the bible though there's nowhere in the bible that you got right believe what you want to believe amen according to the constitution you can believe what you're wearing all right but now get what i'm saying that soul is either faith or doubt if you're not born again the nature of your soul is doubt right that's right totally in the form of doubt and if it dies that way where's it going it's got to go to the regions of the office there ain't no extra places running around but if you're born again it's faith all right future home the prophet draws two hearts now to me that's one heart you can do what you want to but i believe that was describing because he said here's one heart and he put a snake in it he said that's old the old nature that's right then he draws another one he put a dove in i believe he was drawing the same heart in the two conditions right when we come into the world we come into the world with the nature of satan right amen all right lost and doomed and on the way to hell that's why the unclean spirit has to go out jesus said see before you talk about salvation all right now so there's that snake in there that was it and he said that snake goes out and the dove comes in so it went from doubt to faith all right now we're in the message then we know what we're talking about but now here's what i've been trying to get you to see that even in a fallen estate now you're still with me even in a fallen estate your soul was created in the image of god right because you're a little creative there's nothing can be withholding from a human mortal that can reason it out amen that's right you ever heard of uh what is it um what is the radio to the head is it it's made from either waves it's made from cat powers or whiskers they call it but you know i mean they had that in the 40s that you didn't have to have no power you didn't have to have no nothing and they had a radio see man had devised that so i told you brought them up and then were studying he said they were doing it at the end of world war ii how to decompose a human being and send him to california and they could do that but they just couldn't get him back together right then all right well what do you think they're dealing with now look at the things of mankind look at even your medical signs talking brother richard this morning his sister just had a knee replacement and i said brother richard we don't believe in getting a new body you know i leave this body redeemed okay i believe that now i believe this body is going to be redeemed but you know what they're just making you new parts now and you can go have a new knee put them you can have everything that they've transplanted everything except the brain and you better believe they're they're working on that but that's the only thing i know of that hadn't transplanted right so then you could be a new man it might cost about 50 million dollars danny's pretty good going pretty good he's a couple of millions now from falling off that chicken house and thing but that still ain't going to make him new because he's still our old body's rotten away don't make no difference but all right but now listen because see the body's not in the image of god right now right the soul is what's in the image of god the the body is in the image of the animal like that's why i gave you a quote that's in there where brother brown says it says let us make man he said he was talking to the animals brother god was talking to the animals about how to make the man but we're going to have to really get into something in a minute because you have to hold that to a good point right there but watch that all right but now watch see then if we die we have a place to go to what's going there the soul the soul because that's you that's a celestial right all right and brother brown even uses the word for it as a theophany because see we look at the word theophany and we just make it whatever we want to make it but put around made it a theophany is a a body right above these bodies that you're looking after more real right what did he say about beyond the curtain of time i told you i used to have the idea that uh you know your your soul your your things had no feeling whatsoever and i preached it that way and then one day i had to come out here and correct my own preaching card then i found where the prophet said in that soul beyond the curtain of time that they had feelings and senses and could feel and things like that so i lied i kicked off what i thought and i still believe what he said that the soul don't eat the soul don't eat it don't have to eat it eats spiritual it eats greater right now and what did it eat if we're lost right the devils mean you what does it eat if we're saved from god's menu all right so we just keep going right all right now so we have a place to go to jesus went and preached to those souls in prison they were in their souls there and he preached to him but they couldn't be saved but they were real people there now not 16 element bodies right the soul right what is the soul of man well it's just that little winch square compartment you know that's sitting uh see now brother when he was explaining that if you'll read it real careful he said science says maybe that could be the abode of the soul is your soul an in square compartment or is it the real you that's right but brother said it like this is what he said you don't see me he said you see the body i inhabit it right amen but now what does it look like what did them people be on the curtain of time that brother around went there and the angel said these are souls under the altar now what they look like people right right right that's the men had shoulder length higher right they had on kind of like garments of gowns and things but they were real man he said you could feel them well what about the regions of the lost did he not go to the heart he said i've been to both places right but like i've told you if you'll remember get it correct you go check when he went to the regions of the lost he was like 12 or 14 or somewhere right in there years old that's before he's born again but he saw them women coming up in jc pennies and he said that was exactly what they looked like down there with the painted faces and the goo gosh and all other things that was going on right because they were people not 16 element bodies no but it's greater than that that's what i'm trying to get us to see see the real you and that's the part god is working on to try to save us it's the part of us that's real right amen not just thoughts all right now all right we get off now okay now here it goes on tape here to you i'm gonna say it twice where you'll remember now we're going to change from just being talking about a natural person we're going to talk about people that can be redeemed all right amen all right you understand me we put enough in to talk about the real you that you ought to be able to understand a lot about and and find out why you went the way you went but as i've tried to tell you now even in that fallen condition that soul brother adam would even call it immortal then was he calling it eternal no well immortals eternal immortal means like mortality and this is mortality immortal means like you've got to connect back together with body spirit and soul so you know but i'm just saying just give me that where you won't come up and somebody said look at this quote well i just give you the quote but it says it's a supernatural he called it amen your soul is supernatural why because it's created in the image of god amen oh no my old dirty rotten smell god didn't make your soul dirty and rotten amen and don't blame him you know the message brother said don't blame adam and eve right he said you better blame yourself for what you are we put ourselves in the pawnshop of the devil's world when god created us the soul and put it in the individual that soul was perfect now i did not say eternal i know the difference in the word the word perfect because god can't create something imperfect where would he get it right every little baby you see the soul the spirit of that baby is perfect amen and if the body is as perfect as can be under the conditions of mankind i told you see i'm old enough to remember babies used to if they were nursing their mother for six months are almost immune to sicknesses we're perverted now and dying but it used to be a whole lot of difference but you understand what i'm saying now we get that out of the way that's the real you but now that's the part that god wants to work on is the real you sold in prison we'll get to it eventually he said if he can get that soul to stand still long enough he said it'll die why because we need something right all right so now let's get off the natural and get now into speaking of the spiritual condition because we're going to start talking about the children of god amen all right that's why i read the 126-27 now 126-27 is not according to what my understanding is not the creation of every person in the world now ezekiel 18 4 covers that ezekiel 18 4 says all souls are mine but the soul incentive shall die see now does everybody understand that part it's not your body that's gonna the problem it's not your spiritual problem it's your soul that's gonna die because your soul can be saved see when the first man was made now i want to ask you a question when was the first man made when was that in the image of god 126-27 you say well it had to be on the sixth day because it's done you don't got six days of creation and then you've got man now all the natural man come on the six days the human flesh of genesis 2 came on the sixth day that's right i gave you some quotes let's see get on to the backside the last one no numbers to it around says on demonology physical number one physical you know what i'm talking about is one physical one in a spiritual realm 1953 um 608 hey but your souls were made up before the foundation of the world when god created man in his own image so before the world was created amen day one okay day one the world was created right day two this was created day three that's what they've been this man was made before the foundation that's right yes sir amen watch it when god created man and his own image spirit of man not a man in his own image no watching but man in his own image and he made them male and female before he ever made a man in the dust of the earth all right so now we start off with what we can look at and see this man that was made and you're going down to the next position in christ and you'll see there that he said it was made before the foundation world this man was made to rule the earth and he was a spiritual being right because what is god now we've been through that you know what i'm talking about the bible says god is a spirit well what kind of an image of a man did god make right a spirit man himself all right now and he gave him control of the animals all right now when that man was put in human flesh in genesis 2 he not only had control of the animals he had the ability to name all of them right adam named the animals genesis 2 or 3 there and it was brought to him and he named them i never can pronounce all them heck with hopefully one of them words they got for all them things that i like i'd rather call them alligators and buyers and deer and stuff like that they got all these great big words for them but still adam named him now remember in this creation of 126 it was made male and female that's right now we don't believe in garbage cans likes talking the message and i don't believe god is amorphous if you don't like them words forgive me i don't believe that god is like a a a worm that could be male or female that every part is needed can supply i don't believe in garbage cans i believe in the right way because brother branham said and i didn't get to bring this but if you want it i'll be able to find it for you in a hurry he said eve was in adam in theophany right amen now that's our record it's in the hebrew series but i'll be glad to find it for you he was in adam because the bible said he made him male and female that's right that's right now that's in the image of god so when he put him in flesh where was he you know because you come from heaven right right see so then you sisters it ain't just the male is the only one in this thing that can speak the word right amen that's right amen what did he need for come on that's right if adam was so much of a that he could be male or female what did he need any for now brother brown said that god gave his ease to reproduce himself because that's what the church is supposed to do is to not reproduce themselves but to reproduce god all right now we're going on a little okay so now watch what kind of of a being was god he's a spiritual being but see we say spiritual being spiritual being right you know i'm blowing to somebody that can't see and you can hear it i'm just blowing like a wind you know just and run around said god is not like the wind any of these quotes you need call me he's not like the wind he said he's a being what do we think he is you know is it some kind of a just a a vapor or a pillar of fire now that was the form god chose to be able to bring to the human eye to be able to comprehend whirlwinds and et cetera god is real amen you think you're more real in here you got a human problem somewhere between the ears amen to think we're more real than god is he brought us here you better remember that he created us we didn't create him that's where the trouble of the people the message they try to make eve being the one that gave birth to adam i wouldn't quite go that way all right but now follow me so then what kind of a being was god okay we say well he was a spiritual being see that's the finish the hardest seeming thing that i've tried for 40 years now to preach because i don't see god like i think a lot of people think they see what is he some kind of just a glob no form well he's just a spirit brother dale no he's a spiritual being ain't just a spirit he's a spiritual being he's not like the wind he's real what did he look like before he ever created anything else if you're going to believe your soul is your theophany father down with me to come to jesus christ i believe that's what he looked like amen amen i believe that's what god looked like because you know what that's the kind of man he wants all right now but you see then we get down to where the prophet is talking about it on hebrews number three of your notes 57 901 he said is there true eternal life and he's asking the question he said you couldn't answer that could you is there to eternal life he says you couldn't answer that i see we'd be a dummy to try no there's only one form of eternal life when he goes on says there's one eternal life and that's the life of god amen this other kind of life no matter what it is it's got an end to it and anything that had a beginning has an end but anything that had no beginning has no end and that's what your prophet is saying god said he would give us eternal life without beginning we were just made a part of him and actually the life that's in us wasn't brought here by human nature nature gives a spirit but that spirit died and we got the spirit of god was god a man now according to uh what is it uh hebrews 7. it talks about melchizedek calls him a man right a man and that's talking about god right but brother dale you just make god too too uh natural yeah if there's ever anything natural here they had to be a natural god amen that's not no good language i know that because i don't know how to talk i got my ants and totes and carries and stuff like that and hard to translate i know that but still to me god is real amen that's right he's not just a spirit just floating around and one day when we get up to heaven there's going to be a halo over here and there's going to be a spirit floating over here like no capitalist got him with some kind of a dove you know that's floating down and and all these things the bible says the holy spirit came down in what the form of a dove it wasn't a dove it's a form of a dove that was the form god took to be able to be seen me i believe god is real me come on folks if we're real what is god so what did brother brown say was god a man certainly now we're reading what he said let us make man in our own image what was god a theophany a body and our god man was made like that and put over the garden but there was no man to till the soul in the senses right all right so when the animals come into the world on what day fours and fives i think is the days of of animals and things might be into six but anyhow somewhere along about the fifth day of animal life all right you go back and read it see then this man that i'm talking about was there to lead the animals in a theophany but to me if the often he's real amen that's what's so thrilled me when i began to see when brother brown said when he went beyond the curtain of time that he could feel them people they were real brother brown said moses saw the back part of a man and he said it was that theophany man that created all things and moses saw the back part he couldn't see the front part because that would have been bringing the face into view and the bible says no man has seen the face of god and lived see because that would put him you know into a condition he's got to come into something to be able to be made but when jesus christ came here he was almighty god amen that's why he said at least unless you believe that i am he you will die in your sins that's right he who unless we believe that was almighty god walking on the earth in human flesh he will die in our sins because sin is unbelief so what'd he say so when he made that man he put him in the garden over the animals and things then you go on down to the bottom what did it say and god god the theophany came down and was made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem the man now that logos have come out from god the son of god as we call it was god in a theophany a word body a theophany logos speech whatever you want to call it but he stood there and he said let there be all right he made a good point as i was describing to him last night when we went to the passion play i'm just saying it made a good point but somebody caught something and you know how the passion plays begin they always begin in a different scene they don't begin the same scene every year and take it for narrator passion playing atlanta about the the crucifixion of christ all right and she's only done it one time and it was it was like that there wasn't anything and then all at once this man just stepped out i shout hallelujah because this man just stepped back and he said let there be amen let there be the world began to be formed animals began to be formed in all the things and then all at once it changed to where they wanted the scene on earth to be when it did a baby was crying and they started to play at the birth of jesus christ but what was thrilling to me was the same man that came down here as a young man we call him jesus was the same one in the play that was standing here that said let there be because what did jesus look like before the world theophany man all right what is it the prophet of god said what like this and i know i ain't gonna get through this message this morning that's alright we'll finish it this evening look at the next one number four on your notes hebrews chapter 4 chapter 2 part 3 57 8 28 now the logos that went out of god which was the logos all this began to form into a body shape listen and this body with body shape was called in the scholars teaching logos now get the point of body shape not just a spiritual looking you know just a glob just a body shape why didn't we come up here looking like monkeys because god's not a monkey why didn't we look like a rhino or a hippo some of us do but that's around the belly but that doesn't have anything to do with it listen he made us in his image that's right amen so what kind of an image was he the prophet said he was a theophany being deformed into a body shape this body shape was called in the scholars teaching logos the logos that went out of god in other words a better word for it was a what we call a theophany now here's his definition theophany is a human body are you reading it that's glorified now watch it not exactly with flesh and blood like it will be in its glorified state but it is in is of a form of a human body that doesn't eat neither does it drink but it's a body a body that's waiting for us as soon as we leave this one and there we enter into that body that's the kind of body that god was for he said let us make man in our own image in our own likeness and see i like to cut off things before people get their thinking ability but theopny don't eat those beyond the curtain of time were not eating those in hell were not eating right neither one of those were eating all right he said well brother dale we got you though because look at melchizedek okay let's look at melchizedek the real melchizedek was almighty god right almighty god didn't have to eat right the flesh that he was in was what was doing the eating the theophany was inside of our you say well how do you know about that because that's what how else would it be that's what i said i mean what else would it be right inside of that body with almighty god is not saying that man that sat down and made the case was god he's saying god was in that land right because that body that jesus lived in wasn't god that's right it was the body god dwelled in that's right brother aaron he's i don't know where the world he's actually pray for him he sure missed a lot lately but he had a good point he said god just standing up there he remembered and he was saying okay to the angels he said come here uh michael come here gable and he went and just created a body and they stepped down that was the two that went down to sodom is that the way the prophet said he said then he just spoke right back out of existence but see then he stepped into a body an earthly body that come down and could eat the kite and drink the metal but inside of that was where god was at right right so your body is not your theophany right right that's not your soul that's what i'm trying to get you to see that's not the real you the real use inside of there wanting to be brought out into being all right so what did he say he goes down to number five which is the same quote out of the hebrews and he says that man was made finally in the garden in the image of the animal and given a foot like a bear and a hand like a chimpanzee etc etc made us naturally in the image of the animal all right because like i said there was a beast we wasn't made to look like the monkey now a lot of us act like it and i think some people do look like a monkey but that still don't have to undo it we can't hit what we look like you know we're just what we are all right but that was the natural part when the man was made but look at the life part of what it says there the met your body's made just the same kind of material as a horse or a dog number five on your nose or anything like that it's made out of calcium potash petroleum cosmic light you're just no all flesh like that not the same flesh because you know that paul is described as a the the flesh of a bird is the flesh of an animal that's flesh it you know all right but it's made out of the dust of the earth where it come from but the difference between an animal and a man god put a soul in a man and he didn't put it in the animal because the soul that was in the man is that theophany now so that theophany so what happened in the garden you have adam coming into being as the first human being as we call it that's why it's called the first adam all right now we were talking about last night see then jesus is called the second atom right but what he's called by paul is the second atom is meaning that he was not you know it's not secondary the second adam which is jesus christ is the beginning of the creation of god now adam was the beginning of the natural human race right the natural human race begin with adam and i do not believe that there were more people made than adam they made eve from adam but not more people made now and i'll go back to the bible did there is doctrines that there were other people made and where did cain get his wife and what happened here he married his sister that sensible plain language hundreds of years before he left there all right but you see they say that there was more people made now according to my bible now right the bible says that eve is the mother of all living right so if there's any monkeys in outer space running around up there on these planets that you're going to call exterestoral beings they come from this earth because eve was the mother of all living now that's blunt that's i don't even argue with nobody about it see i argued this before ever coming this message because i knew i had a little sense i told you i run into a man that believed that before i come in this message to believe that a person didn't even have a soul boy he was laying it out there at work and he had these books laid out and he was laying out all these things you know i didn't argue with him in front of nobody i just waited till it's over and i said you don't believe man had a soul until the law came he said no he didn't i said well according to my bible in genesis there it said god breathed into the nostrils of adam and he become a living soul right he said i never thought oh my goodness you got a whole lot of books proven everything else but never thought about the bible you're a unit you've got to have body spirit soul to make you a unit that's right the law came to bring us some knowledge of sin right right it became as the prophet said allah to tell you don't do this right cause the conscious part of man is made as i was trying to say a while ago every person in the world you go to africa you go to the to the far region to the north you go and they're worshiping right right totem poles images of animals any kind of a thing why because that soul within that even though it knows nothing about what we talk about god in jesus christ but yet it's wanting to serve god amen and you won't talk about sincerity take one of your babies and feed it to an alligator that's why you don't argue with me about things i know i'm blunt we don't talk about to me oh but brother dale i'm sincere you remember the prophet said you'd be sincerely wrong oh i love god he said you love god with your spirit anointed ones beat us to death about the love they're out there feeding the world and we're sitting here with our bellies being fat all right but now listen that man that he put in the garden what happened to that man all right now i proved it to you and it's in the nose there i'll get back to it to see we don't read word that god came down in the form of a bodily form and he uses the word immorphy on who is this melchizedek and it's in the notes we'll get to it to see that god came down in an amorphy body but he said we bypassed that he said because we come into the world to be tempted of sin amen but he said we returned to that here but you see god was in a full form word body standing there and said let there be let there be all right but now what happened here he comes and he creates a man in the image of that right 126 he creates a man in the image of that now we get to it this evening it wasn't just adam that was created there it was all that will ever be born again is created there that's right we'll get back to that but here he is in the garden what happened did all of that man that we see standing there the logos that theophany that said let there be did it step into adam no it did you got a problem you got a problem no because there's no way that man could fall but see a part of god was placed into heaven amen because when you get the new birth you don't get all of god and nobody else ain't got no opportunity to be saved but you get a part of god by the new birth which is the soul of almighty god which is eternal life which is all of god but not the all of god like that right we are little gods but you know we're not the god of the heavens that's right our universe is down here right are you listening but he said let us make man so here was adam his spiritual being created his soul is being it's the obvious but i believe they gave you the hebrew good i believe your soul is your theophany amen i believe even in a lost estate that your soul is the real you amen but you see like i said now how you gonna know what the new birth is if you don't even know what you are right right where is the new birth is it in your body is it in your spirit is it in your soul i was talking to a man one night about it he said oh i come here with this eternal seed inside of me i said where was the day was it in your body was it in your spirit was in your soul he said i ain't gonna answer you because you better try to answer that he was smart he's a lawyer he real longer he knew he knew that if he said neither one he's gonna track himself so he said i'm not gonna answer you i said no you're not gonna answer because you don't know where it's at but you see when adam was placed in the garden remember when the animals were made adam the theophany man was there to rule them because his soul was created before the foundation of the world his theophany his being but then it was only a part of god that was put in adam now here's the theory of mankind that you watch it and you'd say well there's adam he's body spirit and soul so you say well let's give him a body and i see you give him a spirit and then god put his own soul in there that'd make him god he wouldn't be happy right right it wouldn't be he'd be god that's sensible you need a light bulb turned on no it's sensible i feel i like to talk sensible to me the bible's the only thing that's sensual this message is the only thing that is simple ain't nothing else sensible ain't nothing else you can't poke holes in i don't care who's theories or whatever but you can't poke them in this message that's right well i've run around contradicting yourself you're coming come on bring it i'll pay you away here and let's sit down and talk about it that's right because if brother branham's message now i know where he made mistakes when he's talking about the white horse rider sure we know that because god had not opened the word unto him and nobody could correct him on it that's right i don't care if clarence larkin talked to my horse rider was the antichrist before brother brown ever come along but that didn't make clark larkin a prophet but listen adam's standing in the garden then finally was created a natural man in genesis 2. and when he did god placed that into adam so adam was my body spirit and soul read blasphemous names he was made body spirit and soul as heaven standing there his soul was a creation it was not eternal it was a creation but then god breathed into his nostrils and he became brother brown says 27 28 of blasphemous names he said he became an eternal person adam had eternal life in his soul because he had the life of god now i'll get there just we'll back up this evening because you see that's what god wants right adam in the garden was what god wanted that's right now listen to what i'm saying if you don't like it forget it adam and eve in the garden was not what god wanted you say yes he does that's okay you've got a point now but hold the point because once eve was pulled out of adam and placed in a human body she was subject to fall i don't want to go back to the garden people say we want to get back to the garden no i don't want to go back garden because we'll go back garden and fall again i don't care what you think about you can't fall i don't believe you can fall from eternal life no way in the world can you fall from eternal life well the prophet said on the seal book that adam and eve felt from eternal life will you explain how he fell from it when the prophet said god's not an ending giver he don't give you eternal life to take it back what's he talking about adam and eve was supposed to come forth and finally become eternal embodied because adam's body had a beginning and having a beginning it was not eternal right that's right but if he had not fallen he would have become eternal because the tree of life was in the garden for him to eat off of hey come on the tree of life is this word the tree of life is the word of god which is jesus christ in word foreign that's what we're doing now eating our way back to prophecy we're eating our way to eternity just keep eating on the inside man and then let's keep pushing out the outside man till one day it'll change his man amen and make this man you're looking at eternal that's right then i don't have to worry about it can't fall once you get there because adam's body was not eternal hey i want to get back into the side of adam i don't want to get in the side of the church come on you forgive me now for saying it that way i don't want to get in the side of eve because he's the church the church is what's messed us up church is what's taught us wrong the church of this message is what's teaching the people wrong but it's like we said last night and the father talking about the five full ministry brother ryan said if your pastor won't stay with the truth get away from me oh but brother dale i've got to go here i've got to go there and they're wonderful sweet people where your soul is at stake so go ahead and do it he said you won't die take a fly and get it let a fly fall down in your soup and then you take the fly out and eat the soup right you won't do it but yet you'll swallow down the most garbage cans of all of the message of the hour and just keep right on going he said what are you trying to do give us all to move to lulu i don't want you in lulu if god don't want you in lulu i told my son-in-law when he was talking and marrying my daughter i told him i said i don't want you in lulu because you're my son-in-law and that's true i said i want you in lulu because of the word you come because of the word everything else will be fine i'm not trying to build up and try to face it but there's one thing about it like we talked about life's nighty gay song where did you come from to get here why did you come from other places to get here that's right exactly right come on i told plane why did you come you wouldn't brother dale without for trying to get you here that's right or offering you a couple of you know free meals to get you to come in but i like what brother whitney used to say if you get them in with a hot dog you can get them out with a hamburger right you get them here because you beg them to come and then turn around and they leave they'll take people with them that's right that's right let them come and hear the word then you say he gave us this that's and we honor it all right but you see adam god only put part into adam he said how can you describe that well there was a man named moses one time and his father-in-law said you're taking too much on yourself you're gonna kill yourself wearing out like you are he said pick you out some men and said support them for the job not only did he put him out in the point of the job you know what god done god took the spirit off of moses and put it on the 70. right remember how many it was back here and put it on you know what brother said he said never left moses with no less spirit now you explain that right brother harris always enjoyed that point he had to make he said satan or left jesus alone because he's only facing one christ amen but when he killed him there was 120 at the first whack he'd been better off went on vacation left him alone right that's right but he can't do it right but the more pressure he puts on and the more he kills the more god will bring out because it's spiritual multiplication that's the part i'm talking about brother said we have a part of god how did he describe the part of god he said a spoonful of water out of the ocean he said in volume in volume it's not the same but he said in quality the spoonful is the same elements as the whole ocean he said that holy ghost i was looking at this morning three o'clock he said that holy ghost will be given out one day and say what it is it'll all be old it's the same holy ghost but adam was what god wanted that's what he wants every child to look like and to be like that's right but you know what i loved our adam had nothing to do with receiving eternal life come on god imparted to adam eternal life he had nothing to do with it but you do because you've got to submit yourselves and become the place of being justified sanctify and fill with the holy ghost to have eternal life hallelujah you have something to do with it that's why we are the offspring of god amen adam was called the son of god because god created and stepped into it but jesus christ was almighty god and by that life that was within him being able to come back on me in you body to body he's my brother my kinsman spirit to spirit he can anoint my spirit but he can also anoint other people's spirit that are not christians i don't want to stay in that realm right the soul the soul amen he comes and lives inside of us amen that's what i'm talking about now your soul is your theophany when you're born again now your soul is your theophany why because it's got an uppercurve come on brother now it's got an uppercurrent to it that's right before it was going downward now it's going upward this whole body is going to be changing just right along right but you know what i love about that our bodies is the head of the world because we're going to get eternal life embody before the world is made eternal one day this world will be made eternal why because because our body come out of it because our bodies will be eternal because brother brown said jesus there when it says on the river jordan that this is my beloved son and who month leads to dwell but a random future home said it like this he said this is the part of the earth that i have redeemed and said from this part of the earth i will redeem the rest this is the plan of salvation this is not just talking about something or whatever but it's getting us to know who the real you is understand what you are see we're going to live on somewhere whether saved or lost you're going to live on somewhere the loss will live on somewhere until the judgment day but the christian will live on and there won't be any judgment there that's right what do we got right tier 26 and spiral 226 anybody have a need y'all is open jesus they got married listen i had a kidney problem it's been bothering me for a year getting embarrassed 70 years old everybody understand you know i don't have it now got healed is no we're gonna be changed don't sing that is oh is is is now is
