[16:23] we're starting a new class we're not
[16:26] going to start on July the 15th this
[16:27] year because I talked to one of the
[16:30] representatives that the university
[16:33] there and they got all brand-new
[16:35] material totally different this the one
[16:38] we went through was 13 weeks now they
[16:40] say that much money in 13 weeks we took
[16:42] them out when we started we took them
[16:44] out 13 weeks later that's how much they
[16:45] saved in 13 weeks then money that they
[16:47] paid off in debt and you say how much
[16:50] why is that so much for debt avoided
[16:52] we'll see like june and i refinanced our
[16:54] loan at a 3.75 percent interest rate for
[16:57] 15 years so we reduced our years plus we
[17:01] reduce your interest rate so we saved 40
[17:03] thousand dollars in interest that was
[17:05] dead avoided had we not put the class
[17:07] with a state where we're at all right
[17:09] sins and things like that we avoided
[17:11] other things but we can get into that
[17:12] when we do the class but the class will
[17:14] now start all this to fifth for those of
[17:17] you that are going sister Regina sister
[17:19] milka grubbing rude Bobby Monica aaron
[17:21] and sarah joyce and danny anderson and
[17:23] now sister Barbara Jacob fountain Timbo

[17:28] treaty two sons already signed up feel
[17:31] free to sign up if you want to it will
[17:34] pay yourself on your web on
[17:38] this guy's went guns all over it back
[17:41] here and then Boyd and Dan had said I
[17:43] think they're there they're kind of
[17:46] running neck and neck and he's trying to
[17:47] save the most money but but it works but
[17:50] with that makes 13 couples are 20 people
[17:53] but we're going to start off as the
[17:55] fifth because it's all new material
[17:57] everything's brand-new actually we will
[17:59] probably one of the first classes with
[18:02] the new material all right so we wanted
[18:04] to do it on july but we need to wait
[18:06] till August the fifth to get all the
[18:07] material here and it will run from
[18:09] august the fifth to sep tember the 30th
[18:11] or if you want to take off labor day
[18:16] week and we will take off labor day
[18:18] weekend if you're going out of town
[18:19] because it's you know ask the other guys
[18:22] it's it's it's critical that you're
[18:25] there at everyone and it's critical that
[18:26] you're there each consecutive week
[18:29] because it's just like that you know
[18:30] it's late for something you if you can
[18:32] do it at home as you want to but you
[18:34] know it's kind of like you said if you
[18:35] were going to Weight Watchers if you
[18:37] didn't have to go over tuesday and get
[18:38] up on those scales in front of all these
[18:40] people you feeling laughs but if you

[18:45] you got to get up on those gals in front
[18:47] of those people then you'll you'll you
[18:49] know your attitude toward it will be a
[18:51] little bit stronger but I'm going to put
[18:53] this back up downstairs to sign-up sheet
[18:55] so if anybody else wants to do it fine
[18:57] with me Jim and I love to do it and

[19:25] the next much better kick but it's nine
[19:27] weeks nine forces and it will be fine
[19:32] for those of you that have already took
[19:35] it you know you ask any questions about
[19:36] a new material from the old members is
[19:38] the key

[19:43] to the representative he said all you
[19:45] need if you want to come to the class is
[19:46] a new workbook which is fifteen dollars
[19:49] so those users took the class and want
[19:51] to come into this class but remember I
[19:54] want to stretch this some of you that's
[19:57] taking this class please watch some of
[20:00] the children for these people that are
[20:01] going to take the class because you've
[20:04] been through it somebody's watched your
[20:05] kid come and watch somebody's children
[20:07] while they can take the class for those
[20:09] of you that are gonna take the classroom
[20:11] for maybe some of you others that are
[20:13] not going to take the class that's the
[20:15] too stubborn to change we will allow you

[28:44] hearing by the word goddess now forgive
[28:47] our sins because that's what we wonder
[28:50] stand completing you we don't want
[28:51] nothing to be a hindrance whatsoever
[28:54] between us Lord we love you we thank you
[28:56] in Jesus name we've been reading this we
[29:01] read this scripture ever services
[29:03] coaching it's the whole point right the
[29:08] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[29:09] gave unto him to show it to his servants
[29:12] things which must shortly come to pass
[29:14] and he sent and signified it by his
[29:17] angel unto his servant John who buy a
[29:20] record of the word of God and of the
[29:22] test
[29:22] Jesus Christ and of all things that he
[29:24] saw this it is he that readeth and they
[29:27] they hear the words of this prophecy and
[29:29] keep those things which are written our
[29:31] end for the time is at hand ever you may
[29:35] be seated where that is blessing the
[29:38] reading of the word now we're trying to
[29:42] cover some things no I hope that helps
[29:47] you because to you know get a good
[29:52] understanding got some comments about
[29:53] the mornings message and you know I'm
[29:57] just trying my best to get us to a place
[30:00] that we can be anchored in the word not
[30:05] carried about by every wind of doctrine
[30:08] an idea but just stand on it and you
[30:12] know it's been quite a controversial
[30:15] thing over the people of the message of
[30:17] this x brother round has said and you
[30:22] know but if we just wait I know one
[30:25] person said like from the Feast of the
[30:27] trumpets they put a round of mates with
[30:28] me slips of the tongue it couldn't be
[30:30] understood that he said it was dust at
[30:32] the boy well you know I don't think he
[30:35] might slips of the tongue I think what
[30:37] he does is he spoke by revelation when
[30:40] you speak by revelation it's going to
[30:42] automatically wind up you know looking
[30:45] odd because as I said this morning about
[30:47] that scripture where it said jesus said
[30:49] I am the door of the Sheep he didn't say
[30:52] I'm the door the chief oh that's fine
[30:54] that's over another stretcher you know
[30:56] that he is that door but Mara was you
[30:59] too John chem 7 I think that you know I
[31:02] am the door of the sheep and see that's
[31:05] what i wanted to me i want you to be my
[31:07] whole goal my revelation
[31:09] my desire my thoughts and everything is
[31:12] to be based upon him and that's what
[31:16] we're trying to do is get that
[31:18] understanding to us of the word of God
[31:21] but its revelation of Jesus Christ the
[31:24] entire Bible is the revelation of Jesus
[31:27] cravat but he then we found that we were
[31:31] in a day and time maybe of thinking
[31:34] about a revelation of Jesus Christ even
[31:36] actually come into message and that was
[31:38] right to try to understand about Jesus
[31:41] himself and that was good but then we
[31:45] come to find out that all of the time
[31:46] he's been trying to get us to see where
[31:49] he's at and I've always said it that way
[31:51] I said you know we've said spent six
[31:54] thousand years time to prove there's a
[31:55] God up in heaven and God has spent six
[31:58] thousand years found the privity down
[31:59] here with us look like we'd get that
[32:02] right eventually and I'll be able to
[32:04] move on with a whole thing but they
[32:07] would always try to figure it happen
[32:09] when we try to figure it out then we
[32:11] will miss it by trying to interpret it
[32:14] that's right now and that's that's where
[32:16] we try to wait I've seen things and had
[32:19] things in my heart and sometimes keep
[32:21] them as much as 20 to 30 years before it
[32:24] ever get to preach other because if I
[32:27] can't see it by revelation then what's
[32:32] in the needle me just making an
[32:33] intellectual speech you know I've giving
[32:36] you the quotes and the things and also
[32:38] when you hear me preach you you know for
[32:40] sure that there is something that I'm
[32:42] trying to get across before I spoke to
[32:44] me about and it may take it may not be
[32:46] in one message you might take 10 to get
[32:49] off one thought you know the people and
[32:52] get it covered up alright so now what I
[32:55] want us to do is go back to quote number
[32:57] eight on the mornings message and and
[33:03] review that just a little bit and you
[33:06] know try to get to a point to see
[33:09] something that we covered this more
[33:12] in it on and been covering how that John
[33:17] was a type of the rapture well now as
[33:22] I've tried to bring out this morning to
[33:23] you that John was typing at without
[33:28] within 2,000 years almost from that time
[33:31] and the rapture itself has a transpired
[33:34] yet but John spoke of it back there and
[33:38] what's happening now is exactly what he
[33:41] spoke out there you know and was given
[33:44] unto him to bring up to us and all but
[33:48] it doesn't mean see if it will but
[33:51] people say well the Lord came in 63 and
[33:56] you know and they say well Mary what I
[33:58] prove it to you see look at I said the
[34:00] Prophet went out of Arizona and he met
[34:02] the angels of the Lord to come back to
[34:04] the seals inside the other and so the
[34:06] Lord came in 63 what you know that was
[34:11] only program right because if he didn't
[34:14] speak it and what you did catch it while
[34:17] he was preaching on the seals and things
[34:19] you know some people caught it but most
[34:21] of the basis of people didn't catch it
[34:23] no and so then it it's something that
[34:28] I've tried to get you to say look at the
[34:30] Bible asst is speaking to you and I all
[34:35] right it's revealing Christ but it's
[34:38] Christ the mystery of God reveal a
[34:40] they paid said before that the Prophet
[34:43] said the brightest part of the mystery
[34:44] and must be revealed well then if you
[34:48] just went through the Book of
[34:49] Revelations and speaking only of Jesus
[34:53] then where would you be like I told you
[34:57] you won't see him in Revelations myself
[34:59] he's in bright for because why because
[35:03] under their Pentecost when the Holy
[35:05] Ghost came he's been in bright for me
[35:07] recently and that was the form of God
[35:09] that is the form of God all right we'll
[35:11] get to it maybe wednesday on some pains
[35:14] but run around said he come down to the
[35:16] church age is a son of god was that
[35:19] didn't write in the end time he'll come
[35:20] forward to the son of man well he's got
[35:23] to do that before he can go to the
[35:24] Millennium to fulfill the scriptures you
[35:27] know and fulfill what we'll get to
[35:29] Wednesday you know about the throne of
[35:31] God come on but now we were trying to
[35:34] get that point across this morning that
[35:36] I believe it's a day and a time to
[35:40] understand as we read it dirt spoke of
[35:42] learning revelation 13 this is the time
[35:45] to understand this is the time now to do
[35:48] what this is the time to be caught up
[35:52] rapture word rats remember profit that's
[35:55] not even in the Bible says the word
[35:56] caught up right all right this is the
[35:59] time for us to be caught up in the
[36:01] revelation of what the profit is brought
[36:04] to us all right now there she ratchet
[36:07] man see because the little ate
[36:10] them all in the blink of an eye is what
[36:13] we talked about rats you know gone off
[36:14] the earth but if we're not caught up
[36:16] into the revelation and prepared for the
[36:20] moment then we're not going to be in
[36:23] that group that will be changing them
[36:24] all to take the life we may have to go
[36:26] by the grave then I've said that 40
[36:29] years ago that's the biggest portion of
[36:31] people in the end time would have to go
[36:33] by the grade because we would not be I
[36:35] said we would not be able to have the
[36:38] time to change us the more quickly and
[36:41] that's fine with me if I have to go that
[36:43] way it's not degrading nobody right but
[36:45] it's the truth somebody's going to have
[36:47] to stand there that can look Beth right
[36:49] in the face and say get out of here you
[36:55] know how no part to do a lesson
[36:57] yeah just go on huh you said well we
[37:01] will never do that well the Prophet said
[37:03] we would so I believe it and why can't
[37:07] we believe it we're part of it you know
[37:10] I mean if it can be done I want to be
[37:12] part of what's being done all right but
[37:14] now John being caught up he is the type
[37:20] of the bride but then we were covering
[37:23] how that John had an experience now hi I
[37:29] see I'm trying to think of how it was
[37:32] preached years ago and forget I mean
[37:34] miss it a little bit think about it that
[37:37] John never saw his own experience I'm
[37:43] sure he's in the part of the body of
[37:44] Christ and I don't understand but John
[37:46] didn't necessarily see his own
[37:49] experience he did because I said that he
[37:52] was in the body part of honor but what
[37:55] he saw was the experience that you and I
[37:57] are going down because if he saw his
[38:02] experience now listen and that's all he
[38:04] saw then he was in the grave better
[38:09] you're saying right did you say well
[38:11] John saw his experience well he's in the
[38:14] grave then but he saw somebody that
[38:19] haven't experienced that is going to
[38:21] have an experience upon this earth to be
[38:24] able to be changed all right so then he
[38:27] would be on the speaking of what is here
[38:29] in the end time the orsay wouldn't say
[38:32] about that that he he had his own
[38:35] experience but with his experience he's
[38:39] in the grey somebody go out to how the
[38:43] experience of not going by the credit
[38:45] all right why can't we believe we're
[38:47] part of it you know I mean somebody's
[38:51] gotta be it why not no one on us and
[38:55] just me into that point all right now so
[38:58] let's see if we can be caught up in the
[39:00] red
[39:01] elation you know how our walk each day
[39:05] in the life that we're living but now
[39:07] let's go back to where we were this
[39:08] morning ending it up by covering it and
[39:12] then we're going to recover this
[39:13] afternoon about the relations for 219
[39:18] and see what's going on so let's just go
[39:22] back and start with a little bit at the
[39:23] top now made it laughter he showed the
[39:27] end of the age of his work here he went
[39:30] on up into heaven now let's do you just
[39:33] feel going up see then I'll show you
[39:36] what's going to be after this after the
[39:38] church in he said John I can't tell you
[39:42] down here in the Lord I never remember
[39:44] when we got down to paul the paul
[39:47] couldn't tell it it was the time it
[39:50] wasn't time to tell what pawnshop all
[39:52] right man do you think he's not going to
[39:55] tell us you know right i mean some word
[40:00] he's going to to come forth and speak
[40:03] about it well maybe we'll be down to the
[40:05] eternities you know and receiving dark
[40:07] but not look but i can't tell you that
[40:11] here in a more cuz I left down here I'm
[40:15] come on higher come up here with me I'll
[40:19] show you what's going to take place
[40:20] you're at home on Oh caught up in
[40:23] Division caught up in the glory his
[40:26] experience now his experience is to see
[40:30] these things like halls experience to
[40:34] see these done but remember Paul and
[40:38] John with the experience they had or in
[40:44] the grave
[40:45] sure now waiting on somebody to have an
[40:51] experience then we'll bring them out all
[40:56] right now thank own though sciency his
[40:59] experience must have been something like
[41:01] that at all take the bridges 12 to 24 if
[41:05] you're putting it down second
[41:06] Corinthians 24 always gone up one day
[41:08] into a vision did you know that he saw
[41:12] things that wasn't expedient for him to
[41:14] even talk about 14 years never even
[41:17] mentioned it see but listen that the
[41:20] difference between them now the
[41:21] difference between John oh all good
[41:24] right is the John you're going to see
[41:26] good right here also he was forbidden to
[41:30] speak off yet hard to put it out to the
[41:33] public oh my I don't believe he could do
[41:36] it for our little trip I took one day I
[41:38] never got over it and never will key and
[41:42] he eats all things that he couldn't talk
[41:44] about I guess he didn't have words to he
[41:47] was caught up in the third Halen's go
[41:50] see up into the third heaven now
[41:54] different when how different when John
[41:57] was caught up and seen Jesus and John
[42:01] couldn't explicit I mean Jesus Paul good
[42:04] eats bread jon is going to expression
[42:06] all right and not a that he's gonna ride
[42:09] it down but remember what I said that
[42:13] when he wrote it down he wrote symbols
[42:15] that's it you put it in symbolic all
[42:19] right see meaning the N would have to be
[42:22] over here how different when John was
[42:25] caught up and sing jesus he was sitting
[42:27] right in a book what you up scene and
[42:30] get it back send it back to the churches
[42:32] always forbidden to speak and join work
[42:36] even asked to put it in a book so it
[42:40] would go all down through the ages oh my
[42:43] it's really turn out to be revealed in
[42:45] this life stays it wasn't revealed in
[42:48] his days it's revealed now as we go
[42:51] along
[42:52] by jon is told to write it down but it
[43:03] was told to put it in simple see knowing
[43:09] then that in the end time the Prophet
[43:13] would come that's right to show it and
[43:16] that's what I something like this
[43:17] morning you enjoying his over the
[43:19] revelations 10-7 and riding he's knowing
[43:23] that all of these things has got to go
[43:25] back to the church but he's wondering
[43:29] how in the world he hit at ipac that's
[43:31] it amen now you can get it back to the
[43:34] church but then it strikes you but the
[43:38] seventh angel is going to be a prophet
[43:42] so then that's the point that we're
[43:45] drilling on but not think about what I'm
[43:46] saying John writes about the church he
[43:56] rats about the church he writes what's
[43:59] going to take place read those Church
[44:02] Ages when you get talent when specially
[44:05] to the overcomer you watch this coming
[44:08] Wednesday night when we get to it
[44:09] because the look at the Lady of seeing
[44:11] overcoming right sit with me and my
[44:14] throne is out what we're coming set my
[44:15] father needs strong that's right they
[44:19] did will begin to pick up a little bit
[44:21] and understand some things about what's
[44:24] going on all right now but think about
[44:29] it all good right john told to ride it
[44:33] send it to the church in you believe it
[44:38] in symbol waiting for the end time to be
[44:43] able to understand
[44:46] so in John sees in Revelation 41 a door
[44:53] open in heaven he hadn't see a door you
[44:59] idiot but he used Jesus he heard a voice
[45:05] and knew it was the voice of Jesus in
[45:07] heaven all of those things getting him
[45:11] ready to come to that point now let's go
[45:14] to number nine because I want you to I
[45:20] want you to think about this segment it
[45:24] doesn't have a weird statement this is
[45:28] taken from our guy a guide 1962 in Fort
[45:32] any evening service good progress
[45:34] selling and now the next time don't you
[45:42] to read it when you read it
[45:49] now the next time before it i know it's
[45:55] nineteen sixty too much
[46:02] fart another thing you will be after the
[46:07] church is completed
[46:14] I retired show brother and my 62 he he
[46:18] was gone and wouldn't coming back no the
[46:21] church is completed are we completed we
[46:25] said oh we're not completed well then
[46:33] she brought around says a lot of things
[46:37] and you know what a lot of it is still
[46:40] in symbols right
[46:49] really quote I hate this quote I throw
[46:52] it in the trash pull it back out so i'll
[46:55] put it back in I didn't see the wall we
[46:58] go why put it back in I said well I'll
[47:01] put it back in and now the next time is
[47:07] far as I know to be with you will be
[47:11] asked to the church is completed now
[47:12] he's probably talking about the building
[47:16] because they were working on the
[47:18] building all right now but think about
[47:23] what he's saying and I walk to the end
[47:25] after the church ages there are we want
[47:32] to go into the selling my seals now he's
[47:40] telling you what he's done he waiting
[47:43] for them to complete the building run in
[47:49] he's done priests on the church ages so
[47:55] can you see what John done John wrote
[48:00] the church ages but never live to see
[48:04] him fulfill right right does that change
[48:08] anything let make any difference because
[48:14] John is not alive today I'm never know
[48:20] it makes his ride John writes to the
[48:25] church ages cinema and sends it to the
[48:27] church Amy then he goes on and he sees
[48:33] the seals the funny exactly what brother
[48:37] branham was doing he finished the church
[48:40] edges and then the seals broke to the
[48:46] prophet and he preached it me I asked
[48:51] her the church is completed I'm gonna
[48:53] come back and it was know that you know
[48:58] I started having services and then they
[49:01] had the seagulls honey we get the point
[49:05] John sees these things and rocks them
[49:11] and sims them to the churches that it's
[49:17] not even come into being yet i right
[49:21] 8090 50 wouldn't be in with the first
[49:24] church in Berkshire change started 1853
[49:27] about 10 150 80-63 151 we get he's
[49:36] sending them to the church brother
[49:40] rather set it to the church Amen all
[49:44] right what's up to God and reveal it to
[49:49] John is actually writing about the
[49:53] things that would take place in the
[49:54] church Agius and sending them to the
[49:57] church ages before the ages even started
[49:59] other than the first one you see that
[50:04] then what would we argue and fuss or
[50:07] think about you know what I was talking
[50:11] about this morning on revelations 10-7
[50:18] and thinking move run around got to be
[50:21] over there when he says the bride's not
[50:25] open
[50:30] see why would we think that what up they
[50:35] get like John John what are you gonna do
[50:37] them all right this thing now they've
[50:39] been cold him a legend that would you
[50:43] put in our language to that I've been
[50:45] going right now and matter to have to
[50:47] the summer at Burghley no on it and
[50:52] before they even started he's telling
[50:57] them what's going to be at his age is
[51:02] that a problem you through the problem
[51:06] for run around to stand here and tell us
[51:08] all the way to the change of the body
[51:10] and email to die and go how the grave
[51:12] and waiting on you and I did you trouble
[51:18] so we got to have it all then
[51:20] chronologically laid out I'm trying to
[51:25] keep our thinking on well if you're
[51:30] studying right you'll see it as
[51:31] identically chronologically correct John
[51:36] is writing to the age for the age ever
[51:38] starts right tell them to the bat of it
[51:41] but tell another do it right there
[51:44] little lady of see ya now it would be an
[51:47] angel messenger they would understand it
[51:53] would be completed I after the church is
[51:56] completed he had wait on something did
[52:04] brother round make the statement like
[52:05] this he said I've got just another step
[52:09] back everybody used the word and fall
[52:12] back he said wait on this to catch up
[52:17] over here he said no nothing sinful you
[52:22] know for the ride you were gonna go out
[52:23] and it yo mama here besides that I guess
[52:26] people was thinking courtly going but he
[52:30] said I can't progress any further
[52:32] he's I'm glad to wait until this catches
[52:35] up over here but I think we've had 40
[52:38] years 40 something now for the world to
[52:41] catch up and I think we were to be able
[52:43] to look around system caught up pretty
[52:45] good you know in what's taking place
[52:48] another day in the hour that we're
[52:50] living and it's time to understand but
[52:54] now what I want us to deal with this
[52:58] afternoon will be the point of seeing
[53:02] revelations for through 19 and the
[53:05] bride's not here but you know what I
[53:08] love about it you know that it shows us
[53:13] you know that John was shown back guard
[53:16] that the lady of seeing age would take a
[53:20] rapture John was shown that contrary to
[53:29] the religious society that the bride
[53:33] would not have to go through the
[53:34] tribulation see you may only take that
[53:41] as a quote but to me it's an actual lay
[53:45] in order of scriptures money it's a
[53:49] great meaning that the bride don't have
[53:51] to go through the tribulation
[53:54] relationally the wrath of God poured out
[53:56] upon the earth is not these plays this
[53:58] is the amateur tribulation that's
[54:04] happening now that you see in people die
[54:07] Michael always emphasized you find the
[54:10] book of Revelation it tells you about a
[54:12] drastic thing happening in like seven
[54:14] thousand million doc let's that's
[54:17] drastic but what about a well let you to
[54:20] show me and I need say those murdered
[54:21] you 200,000
[54:28] yep you think we're not near town look
[54:32] around right and no one let us know you
[54:37] were in the antenna but that's one thing
[54:40] I like about it so let's just cover that
[54:41] this is a minute what's your profit had
[54:44] to say maybe you've never thought about
[54:46] why would it be that we would you would
[54:48] emphasize that we're going to miss the
[54:50] tribulation do you realize that under
[54:58] Catholicism everybody goes to hell right
[55:07] my last hope it dies he went to hell now
[55:12] that's for dr. Joe Ghana Hades whatever
[55:19] words in one of you but you know they
[55:22] found out that that Iceland he done so
[55:25] good and he only has a whistle-stop know
[55:29] you don't want to use that he'll far and
[55:32] threaten you with it and then you got to
[55:34] pay you people out of perfect ovaries
[55:36] you know so many things they'll mouse up
[55:42] to so many so many Pence's mess up to so
[55:45] many days off so many good deeds gets
[55:48] you so many days off to everybody here
[55:50] they were down they got to the Catholic
[55:51] Church where to get a free trip to
[55:54] heaven weldon we're the day when like
[56:01] Steven Wilson said nobody goes to hell
[56:03] so they will have to do away with it I
[56:06] guess because everybody's preached into
[56:08] him
[56:14] well you don't want to appreciate ahem
[56:16] anoche because who's giving the money to
[56:21] the preacher preaches under heaven you
[56:24] said what do you do brother daily I had
[56:26] my brother nawl passed away just
[56:27] recently I'm not understanding so it's
[56:29] time to like you did you've ever said to
[56:32] me well she preaches Kimmel I preach to
[56:34] the congregation sitting in front of the
[56:36] window mentioning good i don't know
[56:38] where he was nailing but they're hailing
[56:41] racing tomatoes but he's done a good job
[56:44] raising delayed of the murder maybe they
[56:47] had him up garden have a job already
[56:49] Florida now would you see that's where
[56:52] they get your money from now what would
[56:55] it do how it applies brother Colley if
[56:56] all the preacher got it and preach all
[56:59] the people that roll down in the casket
[57:00] reach them in the hail I think you have
[57:05] a new church in a hurry would does
[57:09] everybody see if still got that same way
[57:11] one form or another and there's a
[57:16] threatening form to it if you leave us
[57:20] you doing this till you find that the
[57:23] message you out right right you find
[57:25] that where the preachers miss Mason said
[57:27] you leave this church you're going to
[57:29] you're in trouble now let them say that
[57:37] we know that's that same old funny
[57:39] that's Purgatory's and play in them you
[57:42] get out you know if you know a married
[57:49] they got much money you don't know not
[57:51] too good jerks miss messy you might
[57:53] accept you a little bit but you're very
[57:55] rich you're a deep inner preacher
[58:00] come on what i tell it like it eating
[58:04] rice you no i mean you got you got some
[58:10] advantages if you got a good billfold go
[58:14] that's pretty tourist season there by
[58:19] then the religious society held over
[58:24] mankind then we're going to a
[58:28] Tribulation Period doing run around
[58:34] again to preach it what the bride will
[58:36] not go through the tribulation I'm sure
[58:39] he was not well accepted upon that point
[58:42] don't you because it been talking people
[58:46] ever since it's born and all you know
[58:49] we're gonna all go through the
[58:51] tribulation what's the difference in
[58:54] saying we all got a goat relations are
[58:56] saying we all gotta go to hurt her to
[58:58] her right sure you know what's the
[59:01] difference just give a word all turned
[59:05] out to be the same problems it's a wrath
[59:07] of God perching us run around when they
[59:10] kept emphasizing he said now you mean if
[59:13] you married a wife it if you're going to
[59:15] put her through before you marry are you
[59:18] going to put her through tests and
[59:19] trials and and torment to say she don't
[59:22] stand it man said one time and the total
[59:27] further on it but he had his wife living
[59:30] out in the house that my country with no
[59:32] running water no nothing he said my wife
[59:35] stood the test I'm a mover in the time
[59:37] get her some running water I have to
[59:41] admit I wanted to give him some running
[59:43] water
[59:45] come on I didn't like it right all of
[59:53] that deal is I didn't care for it all
[59:56] right but listen church well would the
[1:00:00] Prophet would emphasize you know why
[1:00:03] would you think that you have to go
[1:00:04] through person of persecution in the
[1:00:07] tribulation to purge you it means you
[1:00:11] don't believe that the blood of jesus
[1:00:14] christ is sufficient and I make caramels
[1:00:18] I said sit done it enough it means you
[1:00:23] don't think the blood of jesus christ is
[1:00:26] sufficient yep so you're going to need a
[1:00:30] purging so you don't go through the
[1:00:36] tribulation there for a virgin I
[1:00:38] probably said we don't do that hey man
[1:00:42] now that meant a lot to him it certainly
[1:00:46] means a lot to many a man to think about
[1:00:50] that somebody can believe God enough to
[1:00:55] where there's not any purging to have to
[1:00:56] be done with that in mind now let's just
[1:01:01] read a couple of quotes of profit
[1:01:03] head-on then we'll get over it and
[1:01:04] you'll see these will all just stop
[1:01:06] right together now the bride will go up
[1:01:09] and that's the reason she goes up to
[1:01:11] look at number 10 see the reason she
[1:01:14] goes up it's a real reason money this is
[1:01:19] nothing 62 60 to take inside with Jesus
[1:01:22] Mary 55 56 57 which we realize in
[1:01:27] Revelation it's just one two three
[1:01:29] chapters to the church the church goes
[1:01:32] up in the fourth chapter it does not
[1:01:35] return any more to a 90 chap in order
[1:01:38] don't come back to earth you remember
[1:01:39] this morning we said we would be showing
[1:01:41] that runner Adam would say the drive
[1:01:43] goes
[1:01:44] and not seen the lower something I got
[1:01:46] the revelation 19 not see no more on
[1:01:48] earth she's going up in the rapture all
[1:01:53] right no he does not return again turn
[1:01:58] in war to a 19 chapter that's hike
[1:02:00] through the tribulation beauty when God
[1:02:02] called out the Jews he's in the
[1:02:04] tribulation that God calls the Jews out
[1:02:06] right right now that's right do I eat it
[1:02:09] he went out before one drop of rain
[1:02:12] every hit the earth he was gone the true
[1:02:15] license city now I'm going to ask you
[1:02:22] how many of you but only honest and
[1:02:24] action it and said I'd always connected
[1:02:27] that Enoch would walk off the earth they
[1:02:35] look like that no one of them would go
[1:02:36] through the tribulation you better read
[1:02:38] much right there to find that what note
[1:02:39] would represent some honey and watch
[1:02:43] that's right not one drop of rain he was
[1:02:46] going with tribulation city Noah was in
[1:02:49] the arc you didn't say it right up come
[1:02:55] over right he had hard times but he was
[1:03:00] in the art no tribulation to no one you
[1:03:05] ninny ark he gets rolled up and rode
[1:03:07] over honey watch now before he
[1:03:11] tribulations it a lot without sodomy the
[1:03:15] man of God loves he was out of Sodom
[1:03:18] before in tribulation Cillian new and
[1:03:22] the church will be gone before he
[1:03:24] Tribulation Period now here in the
[1:03:26] Tribulation Period that will be the
[1:03:27] sleeping virgins will be hunted down and
[1:03:29] all of the things and the multitudes
[1:03:31] will be killed but get the point Enoch
[1:03:37] mother even though I was in the arc
[1:03:43] and a lot without a solemn so no wonder
[1:03:47] bread around says you have no Scripture
[1:03:53] if you get the ball I'm talking about
[1:03:56] yeah we're gonna say well we got
[1:03:58] stripped her for going he say where's
[1:04:00] your fitness they know what you don't
[1:04:02] know why he was in the end up he was in
[1:04:04] a true relation with run said no he was
[1:04:07] in the our little bit trouble going on
[1:04:10] that sadly than our they might have said
[1:04:13] well lot look at him it's a yell at luck
[1:04:15] without a shot before the fire rain down
[1:04:19] there's no scripture whatsoever then put
[1:04:23] the right across in the tribulation the
[1:04:25] way you'll purge your fart if the blood
[1:04:27] of Jesus Christ purges us now if you
[1:04:31] don't believe it purges enough now I
[1:04:33] guess that's right you know you can
[1:04:35] think that about lift an excellent now
[1:04:38] watch all these will be tied together
[1:04:39] now let's start tying it together with
[1:04:42] the revelation where the bride goes up
[1:04:44] this is the breach between the church
[1:04:47] edges masiela spreader graft 2363 317
[1:04:52] evening now we're going to turn to the
[1:04:54] fifth chapter and this is not the seals
[1:04:57] it's the bridge between the church ages
[1:04:59] and the seven seals now there is also a
[1:05:02] sixth chapter and there was a fourth
[1:05:05] chapter of Revelation and that it kind
[1:05:08] of reveals something that would take
[1:05:09] place after the church point up that the
[1:05:12] church goes up on the third chapter of
[1:05:14] Revelation and does not return until the
[1:05:17] nineteenth chapter of Revelation see
[1:05:19] therefore the church misses the
[1:05:21] tribulation a man he said that was
[1:05:25] contrary for an ear out of teachers
[1:05:27] leading you up they've got all mankind
[1:05:30] top that this ol holdover from the
[1:05:35] Catholic Church trying to find a
[1:05:37] purgatory to purchase or something to do
[1:05:40] huh
[1:05:41] but now notice what he said the church
[1:05:45] goes up revelations third chapter in
[1:05:49] other words the end of the third chapter
[1:05:52] then you're going to read it to church
[1:05:54] goes up to 4 chapter now you're going to
[1:05:56] go up to 30 big one pit forward the
[1:05:58] ending of the third is the opening of
[1:06:01] the fourth if you've ever one time study
[1:06:06] the seals on that line if you've ever
[1:06:12] study the seals on that one line I
[1:06:15] thought the Prophet said the sealed was
[1:06:18] like building up set of steps right now
[1:06:24] would it be something brother Gary to
[1:06:25] say well okay now we're going to bypass
[1:06:28] the bottom we're gonna start with step 3
[1:06:30] I tell really hearing that I don't you
[1:06:34] feel me some step but I want you to
[1:06:36] leave off the two bottom ones he said I
[1:06:40] can do it but while have you start on
[1:06:44] the sandwiches come day no they got
[1:06:47] nothing to hold it up right
[1:06:53] so the end of the first seal is when the
[1:06:57] second seal open the end of the second
[1:07:04] seal is when the third seal open the
[1:07:09] bride goes up in the end of the last
[1:07:11] verse of Revelations 322 I think if she
[1:07:18] goes up which would be the opening of
[1:07:21] the next because it's a burn that step
[1:07:23] the god is calling up for one is calling
[1:07:26] it up are you understanding right that
[1:07:31] you're ending on 33 22 go for one is you
[1:07:36] going up to seek something and see that
[1:07:42] time together the whole entire Bible
[1:07:44] don't watch what he says that little
[1:07:49] number let's go to number 12 this is the
[1:07:55] fifth seal 1963 322 all right well a few
[1:07:59] paragraph 87 but the reason that he
[1:08:02] reveals that I have I understand that it
[1:08:06] is because the mystery of the book of
[1:08:08] redemption as far as the Antichrist
[1:08:10] being revealed now that's the ending of
[1:08:13] the fourth seal this is in the fifth
[1:08:16] seal the ending of the fourth seal is
[1:08:19] showing the Antichrist revealed and
[1:08:23] you're going through this thing that it
[1:08:25] covers the church and Dom tree right
[1:08:26] here and at the same time the church is
[1:08:29] gone these things don't even happen in
[1:08:32] the church age y'all never be in the
[1:08:35] fakirs tonight gold any money the seals
[1:08:40] in the thing'll actor we're going to
[1:08:41] read exactly where they happen with the
[1:08:43] next book that's right there away from
[1:08:45] the church aid the church absolutely
[1:08:48] fractured at this time the church goes
[1:08:50] up in the fourth chapter of Revelation
[1:08:52] and does not return until it
[1:08:54] on back with his King in the nineteenth
[1:08:56] chapter he seals here are revealing what
[1:09:00] has been what is and what will be and
[1:09:02] now what was to be for the church age

[1:09:25] that because some people here in tapes
[1:09:27] knew they even see it over with our with
[1:09:31] somebody you're in tight your decisions
[1:09:33] long ago joelma set up with a quote for

[1:10:36] is Israel a nation and 19 to 22 is both
[1:10:43] together then the plagues in the morning
[1:10:48] so forth at the end Kenny three parts
[1:10:51] and we're taking the first three
[1:10:52] chapters pertaining to the church huh so
[1:10:55] there's better than order
[1:10:59] you know exactly how spicy all right see
[1:11:04] then a bride is no problem the other
[1:11:05] thing the bride goes up they go into the
[1:11:09] next it was a 12-8 you look at someone
[1:11:13] you got the extra notes you had to get
[1:11:15] an extra piece of paper this is the
[1:11:21] fifth single 1963 322 my graph to 18 and
[1:11:25] that far at this time if you'll notice
[1:11:28] this till so you'll be an open now this
[1:11:31] is opening of fifth still see the church
[1:11:34] is gone it's just be just be it it just
[1:11:38] can't be the souls under the early
[1:11:42] church now now please if you ever did
[1:11:44] give this attention get attention now
[1:11:47] now this is a great controversy Joe want
[1:11:49] you to listen real close man you got
[1:11:51] your papers and things right now I know
[1:11:53] what you know now these cannot be them
[1:11:56] sold because the the souls of the of the
[1:12:01] righteous martyr no Matt debridement the
[1:12:04] righteous people the church the ride and
[1:12:06] done bid took up so they would have been
[1:12:10] under the show they wouldn't be under
[1:12:11] the altar right they'd be in glory with
[1:12:14] the bride now what are they are gone in
[1:12:19] the rapture in the fourth chapter of
[1:12:20] Revelation they was taken up now who are
[1:12:25] the soul in other words where these
[1:12:26] other is Israel under the fifth seal
[1:12:29] right but you see there's no problem
[1:12:34] dealing with the fifth seal and the
[1:12:36] sixth seal to try to push it away and
[1:12:38] say that it's not to the ride because
[1:12:40] its fifth seal showed them the altar six
[1:12:43] sealants the tribulation nobody runs
[1:12:46] along so what about the settlement
[1:12:48] that's
[1:12:52] let me say it in a way that maybe you
[1:12:55] understand the opening of the seals is
[1:12:59] the revealing of Jesus Christ in the
[1:13:04] bride
[1:13:11] because he just told you that we missed
[1:13:14] the tribulation he just told you under
[1:13:19] the fifth seal the test not us are sold
[1:13:21] under the altar no we're already gone
[1:13:26] it's a revealing of Jesus Christ it is
[1:13:28] behind comedy flick the next this is
[1:13:35] from the Feast of the drunk 1964
[1:13:37] 719 one in church paragraph 36 37 now
[1:13:43] begin to notice that the preaching of
[1:13:44] the seven church ages which is a pattern
[1:13:47] are the forecast of all that God was
[1:13:49] going to do with the churches and
[1:13:51] through the churches and Polly
[1:13:52] positionally setting them up the first
[1:13:55] three chapters of book of revelation
[1:13:57] revealed all the happenings unto the
[1:13:59] church the end from the third chapter
[1:14:02] unto the 19th chapter of Revelation
[1:14:04] there is no more scene of the church now
[1:14:07] remember he's talking about Brian he's
[1:14:09] not saying church like worldly church
[1:14:13] you told that bride he called her chart
[1:14:16] right that's not no more scene of the
[1:14:19] church the church filled it up into
[1:14:20] fourth chapter of Revelations and return
[1:14:23] back in the nineteenth chapter that's
[1:14:24] moving riding back with him you don't
[1:14:25] come in a one-horse it the bride and the
[1:14:29] groom together coming to the earth and
[1:14:32] then from the nineteenth chapter is
[1:14:34] conclusive of the 22nd chapter it's all
[1:14:38] on the millennium and what will be in
[1:14:39] the ureters to follow during the fourth
[1:14:42] to the nineteen guard is dealing with
[1:14:43] Israel right huh now if that be true
[1:14:49] what would be the problem of
[1:14:51] understanding that the CEO for not to us
[1:14:57] the revelation of the seals are not
[1:15:00] I don't want it right over our see what
[1:15:04] happens in the tribulation to you I
[1:15:06] don't even one beer / rounded I
[1:15:11] certainly wouldn't want to go even to
[1:15:13] see the field sealed modern Jews right
[1:15:16] no brother on said it was the Jews from
[1:15:18] the time of matt baer hearing away he
[1:15:21] said underling I me the time of Christ
[1:15:23] it come over to the time of Christ when
[1:15:26] I get right the fifth sealed you is from
[1:15:28] the time of Christ and the crucifixion
[1:15:30] and then through the dark ages of the
[1:15:33] times they had funny that's your fifth
[1:15:35] seal jus all right those has been giving
[1:15:38] their lives I wouldn't want to visit
[1:15:40] that with you why can't church then we
[1:15:44] just simply sat down and read the Bible
[1:15:46] as I said this morning to find ourselves
[1:15:50] and find what God is thinking about us
[1:15:54] sure there's a lot of problems in that
[1:15:58] like I've always said do you think
[1:16:00] renren said did you think those Jews
[1:16:03] would have wrote about Abraham giving
[1:16:05] his wife away line and everything you
[1:16:06] know there to there to start you with
[1:16:10] you they're too proud of her leads yeah
[1:16:14] yeah but they had to ride it those
[1:16:19] prophets had to write what are you sure
[1:16:25] John seeds in the church ages I said the
[1:16:27] other day the bad side but that's all we
[1:16:31] look at well that's right it shows
[1:16:35] that's where we had like one brother
[1:16:38] here in this church one time he said he
[1:16:41] said I see myself as that first seal
[1:16:44] denied my horse rider he said then come
[1:16:50] on over to the fourth now get straight
[1:16:51] now
[1:16:55] I said if you see yourself there's a
[1:16:58] white horse ride are you lost yeah we
[1:17:02] know naturally that really thrilled the
[1:17:03] experience yeah you know about that I
[1:17:06] mean it really thrilled it for me to say
[1:17:07] that dude but if you think you're the
[1:17:13] right oh it's rather than you all
[1:17:15] because there are two sets of East
[1:17:17] there's a deer on and then there's the
[1:17:22] beast is called the bride remember the
[1:17:27] four for combat lease was down to the
[1:17:29] church named mr. Braddock rise that's
[1:17:33] the combat we see the deer on base are
[1:17:38] untouchable that's right amen there's no
[1:17:40] right to the control why would you want
[1:17:43] to see yourself and uncontrollable of
[1:17:46] course it's a great revelation I was
[1:17:48] once uncontrollable and then I got
[1:17:50] converted now I'm controllable now you
[1:17:55] can be your horse until little lucky
[1:18:00] would be careful they'll get you an
[1:18:02] anybody gets to change
[1:18:08] but if you love me to fight for you it
[1:18:11] loves you difference in these yep so the
[1:18:17] bride goes up in Revelations for one and
[1:18:23] she's not seeing the more to 19 21 when
[1:18:26] she writes back with him then why we
[1:18:32] want to think that we're over there why
[1:18:35] do we want to study the sealed or
[1:18:36] anything to try to see how bad we are I
[1:18:42] thought we would read the book to find
[1:18:44] out how good we are but our problem is
[1:18:47] we're trying to find out how we're good
[1:18:49] we are I trying to be good or sales
[1:18:54] remember it is neither hath made us not
[1:18:56] we ourselves right that's Bible he's the
[1:19:01] one that's made is perfect why is it you
[1:19:04] and I as the natural people no matter
[1:19:07] how good we are we would be due to we
[1:19:09] deserve to go to the trim lunch right we
[1:19:13] deserve to go to hell it's best if we
[1:19:16] could do Evan was he eaten by the way we
[1:19:23] don't have to
[1:19:25] you might away we don't have to go
[1:19:27] through the tribulation I'll try to get
[1:19:33] you to see that even if you look into
[1:19:35] the John riding through the chapter two
[1:19:38] or three of the church a jury wraps of
[1:19:41] the bad suree rocks that they're leavin
[1:19:43] spirits and things like that in the ages
[1:19:46] of none but then he also he never ends
[1:19:49] it until he writes about the overcome
[1:19:52] and now perfect GU moment we want to
[1:19:59] think about being in the tribulation
[1:20:01] well bro today we got that right now
[1:20:04] brother and said without going through
[1:20:05] tribulation look I just can't see that
[1:20:08] other part about the seals more not what
[1:20:13] amazes sales reveal handicraft
[1:20:21] the Holy Spirit reveals Jesus friend
[1:20:23] right by a man no man could go Jesus the
[1:20:27] Christ except it be by the Holy Spirit
[1:20:30] right there's my one of these days
[1:20:33] you'll realize what that prophet was
[1:20:35] saying I'm brother Ray said you start
[1:20:37] off the first seal run around send the
[1:20:40] seals ready lieutenant knows the
[1:20:46] individuality it is only one seal that's
[1:20:51] right six of the seal is broke and Jesus
[1:20:56] crafts me preach them in the Bible they
[1:21:00] would only one seal to be revealed in
[1:21:02] time it was a Holy Spirit he's the only
[1:21:08] revealer of the word me sure we look at
[1:21:14] you receive the sealed an agent hey what
[1:21:17] about us being able to hear now leave it
[1:21:20] the man of sin will be sitting in the
[1:21:23] temple of God shortens have to be as God
[1:21:25] now in the tribulation
[1:21:31] and yet you and I can see it now before
[1:21:35] it ever takes place there are you now /
[1:21:41] even in the message of where they ain't
[1:21:44] supposed to be no more pokes in this
[1:21:45] life nobody's supposed to be number
[1:21:48] so-and-so I don't even know how many
[1:21:50] they say my god I forgot that many woods
[1:21:52] they're supposed to be so many folks and
[1:21:54] this is posted this max guy coming up
[1:21:57] supposed to be the likes of number-wise
[1:22:02] well could that be the same thing that
[1:22:07] everybody said we had to go in a rapture
[1:22:10] in 1973
[1:22:18] could it be the same way was it matter
[1:22:22] to me who the Pope is the Pope I'm
[1:22:26] worried about is that nickel ATM spirit
[1:22:29] that is trying to conquer the Leia and
[1:22:32] the Conqueror the ministry said we're
[1:22:35] Minister spike well bless and neglect
[1:22:37] cover lately don't cover me no it's
[1:22:39] already guessed already gosh yeah well I
[1:22:45] sit right middle of an antichrist system
[1:22:50] believe in the doctrine of this message
[1:22:53] nice now you know we're about Devon
[1:22:56] getting you you've already got you with
[1:23:01] Z church God shows us we don't have to
[1:23:05] go through the trouble I had he send
[1:23:10] this concrete proof but he takes us up
[1:23:13] for touched money and then we're not in
[1:23:18] there any word until revelations not
[1:23:23] kidding you know where we're at work and
[1:23:27] glory you know what brought around said
[1:23:31] about it one day you've talking about
[1:23:34] the Jews the 144,000 I'm sure fronting
[1:23:37] the sick see what he's talking about he
[1:23:40] said well we're up there to marriage
[1:23:42] supper are you explaining this one but
[1:23:46] that's what he said he said he'll slip
[1:23:50] back he'll leave us during slip back
[1:23:52] down here and reveal itself to the Jews
[1:23:58] now we're gonna be running around with
[1:24:00] thrill out of here looking for me
[1:24:05] nah bigger speech bigger speech man knee
[1:24:16] you know the Corporal body laid on the
[1:24:19] throne the Spirit of God is down here
[1:24:22] with us gives us the dead nope he's real
[1:24:32] busy amen you won't Spitzer he's real
[1:24:38] busy in my father's house are many
[1:24:42] mansions if we're not so would have told
[1:24:43] you I go to prepare a place for you but
[1:24:47] around them on the future home cities
[1:24:48] affair right now preparing a place for
[1:24:51] the onion that's on a horse spirit down
[1:24:56] here the body repairs would have to be
[1:24:58] lifeless that's what you're thinking
[1:25:00] that's why you need to get rid of your
[1:25:02] carnality right
[1:25:08] you're talking about God in His ladies
[1:25:13] because he doesn't come down physically
[1:25:18] to reveal himself to the Jews wait a
[1:25:23] minute where you get the reference no
[1:25:25] they see him by revelation he doesn't
[1:25:29] come back physically to the earth and
[1:25:31] feel the millennial reign right so then
[1:25:36] when he reveals itself to the Jews it
[1:25:39] won't be a corporal body right we'll
[1:25:43] still be right there wasn't having a
[1:25:44] good time to marriage something you know
[1:25:48] what brother Brent said they do he said
[1:25:50] he'd wipe the tears of our eyes and say
[1:25:54] well done to make sure we're gonna be
[1:25:59] crying in heaven sadness are happy you a
[1:26:06] lot of people get happy they start
[1:26:07] crying right let me start crying here
[1:26:11] did before that he is down line right
[1:26:14] well because it happy listen jerk this
[1:26:22] is the only point I want to get across
[1:26:23] got it on the enter the next did you
[1:26:26] read revelations folder there's going to
[1:26:29] be a throne but read it real careful
[1:26:36] my round speaks of the salad seal and he
[1:26:39] said revelation 81 is the same s ii we
[1:26:45] got SCE in heat same to the Seventh Seal
[1:26:51] where nothing else is not really said a
[1:26:54] scene
[1:27:00] if we take the book of Revelation to
[1:27:03] think of the symbolic ssin and think of
[1:27:05] the scene that we're talking about like
[1:27:07] I said John looks up to see you drive
[1:27:09] through an open door he saw Jesus now
[1:27:15] you're going to have to enter in to
[1:27:19] heaven for the next scene to open and
[1:27:27] the same job having only open one scene
[1:27:30] at the time just like a bloody unfolded
[1:27:33] the next one phone read revelations for
[1:27:38] one you'll see one comp now when john
[1:27:43] goes up he mentioned again that he gets
[1:27:45] in the spirit just like he did when he
[1:27:48] started back over here and relations one
[1:27:51] he saw throne
[1:27:59] you know it's always on
[1:28:03] we've seen on both he saw one sitting on
[1:28:07] the front
[1:28:13] you don't worry about because God had
[1:28:15] revealed everything to you and I at one
[1:28:17] time we couldn't take it that's right we
[1:28:21] couldn't stand it you money he unfolds
[1:28:25] what we have need of he shows us the
[1:28:29] same we just wait let the prophet tell
[1:28:33] us what that is but John sought throne
[1:28:38] after he got in him you wasn't on earth
[1:28:44] looking for a throne you didn't help
[1:28:49] ever then he saw one on the throne they
[1:28:55] saw rainbow about the Trump ladies all
[1:28:58] 24 elders it just keeps unfold
[1:29:08] is that not the actual play a movie that
[1:29:12] you see we just remember revelations for
[1:29:23] one all that you're seeing in between
[1:29:26] there is going to be related to it which
[1:29:28] showed it do this for me or you see why
[1:29:33] brother Adam saying he was going to
[1:29:34] issue you remember that you remember
[1:29:38] that he was going to Israel program was
[1:29:40] going to issue you already had his
[1:29:42] ticket never mind my people come to
[1:29:44] humor the with addie cost of the deep
[1:29:48] when the two men came to they said well
[1:29:50] your ministry brother round the Jews
[1:29:51] will accept it number in the video he
[1:29:58] was headed that way and his teeth he
[1:30:02] landed in one place over her and
[1:30:03] everyone around looking while they were
[1:30:05] going around looking again Lord spoke to
[1:30:07] its at kumon behind a hang or something
[1:30:09] talk to you he said the naked Tillman
[1:30:14] rice is not fulfilled yet you can't go
[1:30:16] you know what he couldn't go you realize
[1:30:20] if he went Israel would have accepted it
[1:30:22] right there right in the Providence of
[1:30:26] God you and I wouldn't have been part of
[1:30:28] it Oh
[1:30:35] the hell was old enough to be back
[1:30:38] Darwin runarounds ministry somewhere
[1:30:41] mighty close to work that he made no
[1:30:43] statements of trying to go that make him
[1:30:46] be the only one in the building would
[1:30:47] have an opportunity I don't believe that
[1:30:54] he said the Nick with you our house is
[1:30:57] not full field he said don't go he
[1:31:00] turned and went down through Cairo each
[1:31:03] other i guess or something then went out
[1:31:06] when you think those people thought when
[1:31:08] he said I can't go right I'm running
[1:31:13] around why we done got the tickets get
[1:31:14] everything ready you need a wet bar with
[1:31:21] a massage sign what do you think they
[1:31:24] would have done why because all this
[1:31:30] over there is just books and tapes this
[1:31:34] message is in this room I'm actually
[1:31:38] viewed it when not an inner what we
[1:31:40] viewed it off of work run for a great
[1:31:41] actually put this message and run around
[1:31:43] picture only the news media there but
[1:31:52] they're not going to accept it
[1:31:56] no it's not their time but it's yours in
[1:32:00] that time right there's the time to
[1:32:02] understand who we are and what we're
[1:32:05] doing here day event and only those for
[1:32:11] the Holy Spirit will get a full
[1:32:12] understanding of what's going on and to
[1:32:18] see the others that don't have would
[1:32:21] just argue running down what do you mean
[1:32:24] you leaving bread rack mounted it's
[1:32:26] goofy you said we were going up for one
[1:32:28] you wouldn't see no more I didn't say
[1:32:31] that but around here you get your mind
[1:32:34] in the great border first I voted what
[1:32:37] he said that's right with my revelation
[1:32:46] we were to see the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:32:49] don't take this the record i am at we
[1:32:52] don't have to go to look tribulation a
[1:32:53] man who's the next thing this world
[1:32:57] strikes after the rapture this ride is a
[1:32:59] tribulation you think this is a problem
[1:33:02] that'll be the wrath of God when the
[1:33:04] Bible says they'll even pray to die they
[1:33:08] will cry for the rocks to fall on in and
[1:33:10] hide them clever but we're in the time
[1:33:15] the work is to preach a relation
[1:33:21] what about six many six million Jews
[1:33:23] killed in a preacher of life no under
[1:33:30] aight let him earn it right what about
[1:33:33] over here the whole world's going to
[1:33:35] lead to see by the Antichrist yeah right
[1:33:42] like I've tried to tell you years ago
[1:33:44] about it it's not to un it goes after
[1:33:48] the two witnesses to kill 144,000 it's
[1:33:52] the Jews right back where they were when
[1:33:55] they were killing the Apostle the
[1:33:58] natural Israel is going to go after the
[1:34:00] 140-foot how does the natural Israel
[1:34:05] will be an opponent with me enter crash
[1:34:08] that's how deceiving you will be but
[1:34:14] you're not can lead to see a bad vibe
[1:34:16] they were to see we're lost that's the
[1:34:19] best way pudding we're lost right at
[1:34:24] least we were to be able to say you're
[1:34:25] not saying what policy a try to ban
[1:34:27] propensity be glad if they don't tell it
[1:34:30] boys but like on these tiny measure we
[1:34:33] miss the tribulation
[1:34:38] we miss the wrath of God being poured
[1:34:41] out there man because we're done don't
[1:34:46] interaction but now the summit of what
[1:34:51] i'm trying to say but we're the ride
[1:34:54] they have apples and by being the ride
[1:34:57] God has unfolded the entire book even
[1:35:02] from where we are throughout all the
[1:35:04] rest of the world even told us about the
[1:35:06] future home and all of the past my way
[1:35:11] of the Prophet message yeah the symbols
[1:35:17] are all broken the war we can understand
[1:35:20] that the bride is no longer a symbol
[1:35:25] she's a reality amen let's come in
[1:35:28] musicians mr. make on these lands
[1:35:36] we are the bride of Jesus Christ we get
[1:35:44] the whole book to be able to read it and
[1:35:48] how the Holy Spirit to bring it to us
[1:35:52] and make it manifest what a wonderful
[1:35:58] message you and I have had the reality
[1:36:03] to see who we are and what we're doing

[1:36:21] strong we've got to sit with a father
