and Alto and Ballwin it's made up for people all over the world Amen so this is and we you know what it's a worldwide God Amen that brings us all together so uh let's remember them in prayer also remember brother Joe U Solace says she wants to thank everyone that went to the nursing home yesterday they really enjoyed it they want them y'all back every month every week and every day let's try month brother Joe let's try month for a little while I don't think we going need to go up there every every week or every day but but you know what it's it's a it's a Ministry it's a Ministry just like this is Ministry it helps people it's a conduit that God can get to the uh to the older ones ones that are shut in ones that their family won't even go see them anymore sadly and that we can give them just a little bit of sunshine in their life one day maybe out the month all right so remember that remember the mission trip we're going to pray this afternoon at or today after the first service

going to the Lord in prayer just remember that mission trip coming up they'll be leaving on Wednesday the 11th and be back on the 23rd I I think it is 23rd which will be a Monday all right so just remember them in prayer and um like I said this afternoon is offering to go to them too plus the church is going to give them some extra so just remember that by way of announcement again uh if you can't see it but that window back there where the media room is it's been insulated a little bit because and I've been guilty of it myself the media room doesn't need to be a place to joke talk or cut up cuz you can hear it out here in the sanctuary all right so if we have anything personal to say we need to step outside go in the other Sunday school class or what more that needs to be left to um I know brother Joe sometimes gets aggravated cuz and we all do it gets so full there's no way to do your job so let's just stay out of there if you're not part of the media room then just kind of stay out of there and uh let them do their job and they do a wonderful job amen yes they do a wonderful job they get this message around the world people are streaming in now and then they'll be watching online you just don't know who you're going to affect amen so we thank God for them all right also brother Aaron will be speaking for us Wednesday um we will have a prayer service next Saturday at 7 o'clock next Saturday 7 o'clock we'll have a prayer meeting we're only then we'll be a couple of weeks away from the youth service which will be not the third Saturday this month it'll be the fourth Saturday because some of our youth are going to be gone so we're going to have it on the 28th and 29th brother Daryl Ward will be with us that whole weekend all right so let's keep that in prayer we'll have prayer meeting on the 14th at 7:00 and I know most of you do know that there is a wedding coming up on March the 24th and on March the 24th you'll everything you need to know is downstairs on the uh refrigerator is there anything else sister Monica that they need to nothing else they need to okay just read that and and and RSVP accordingly you can do it online and it would be a good thing for you to sign up early so they'll know who's coming also the Valentine's banquet will be February the 11th and we need to know who's coming and who's bringing do we have a list back there yet though Lisa forgot it she has so much to do what you want somebody else to do it you got it okay all right I mean she she's just got she's got so many hands she's like an octopus or she needs to be one well this just going everywhere but we appreciate sister L amen but there'll be a list downstairs for you to sign up and to uh sign up the people that you're bringing in brother Dutch Scot will be with us that weekend to preach for us and to be there on February 11th all right one more thing thing and most of you know June was going to have surgery a couple weeks from now which will be the 18th for hysterctomy but that has been cancelled because she's going to have shoulder surgery Wednesday all right and I can't change my schedule so I probably won't be there so I need y'all to kind of pitch in and see if she needs anything all right and I know you will so I don't have to say any more about it I'm going to try to get back my flight gets back in at 12:00 Wednesday so we'll try to be back for that but she needs a a touch from the Lord for her shoulder and The Guiding of the operator's hands that it'll all come out just right because they were talking about total shoulder replacement surgery last week that's the only thing you can do total shoulder replacement surgery and then they came back a few days later and said no I talked to a colleague and we think we can put that thing back together for you so we just we just rotate our cuff and I've had it too and U it's it's just something that the muscles won't ever ever attached and let you help them a little bit so thank God for doctors that help us amen so let's just remember that in prayer let's go to the Lord in prayer as we stand here today Lord Jesus we love you so much Lord there's a part of us Lord that longs for home but there's also a part of us that knows that there's more work to be done there souls to be brought into the kingdom there's there's the Bride of Jesus Christ to to mature into a wife and and Lord come to full maturity and get away from the milk and and start eating meat father we pray that you would be with us now in the further of this service that we may have some meat Lord your word is so full of promises and it you promis that if two or three are gathered in your name that you would be in the midst so Lord all these requests you've heard all the things that we're doing for the coming up year and the ones that are going on a trip Lord we pray that you would sanctify them Lord that means clean them and set them aside and then put them in service Lord for all of us Lord I pray that we'll bind ourselves together more each one that has a position in this church Lord I pray that we would come to a full stature of a perfect man Lord so that we can as the prophet said lead others into that same path father thank you for the visitors that are among us we pray that you'd bless them today Lord with the ones Lord that are sick there's many that's out today with covid and different things Lord we pray that you'd rebuke that devil and Lord that you would heal them and bring them up Lord for your honor and Glory father just give us this day our daily bread in Jesus name we pray amen like what my dad always says Logan and Angela you're not going to get greeted again because you're just part of us the next time we come to serice so don't think we're going to call your name again okay don't be so embarrassed no did your face stay red like that a lot need to check your blood pressure all right let's go to Son of Man part 80 but it's good to have you here on the front row if you come with Donnie you going to sit on the front row you ain't going to sit back under you going to sit up here Donnie going to lead you Don going to lead you to the front be like his daddy you get up front boy so let's read in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh so this word heard that we've all we know what a Bible is right most Mo the the highest selling book in the world the Bible but do they really know the author of The Bible do they really know that those words written on there are going to become flesh in a in a group of people especially in the end time that's going to take this and give it to the people and we're going to take a body change we're going to get out of here there's something that we are that we're heading toward and I appreciate that look the world's heading toward something so why can't we be heading toward something they're heading toward destruction you and I are heading toward Rapture amen like what somebody said the other day they said you know you you look in the Bible you see that there's Eagles and then there's buzzards the Eagles go up the buzzards eat the people that are here so which which dinner do you want to go to think about that for a minute and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father we believe he's here today right we believe you brought a piece of him with you so there we are full of grace and truth Proverbs 3110 says who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies you may be seated in the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word who can find a virtuous woman that's what we're going to try to background a little bit because we do have some visitors here in background just a minute on on this we're not now now we always want to uh um be diligent in telling our sisters and our brothers to stay virgins until you're married all right stay there strive do the best you can and then give everything you've got to that man or woman that that you're getting ready to marry all right and and if you don't then you know just pray to God that everybody else coming up would hold their self to a place that who can find this is this is Solomon talking about his mother who can find a virtuous woman for a price is far above rubies this is Solomon that had so much gold you couldn't even count it so much gold I mean the Vatican ain't got anything Solomon uhuh Solomon had all brother Bri said richest country richest man richest king that ever was and he says that if you can find one virtuous woman her price is far above rubies all right now in Genesis 2:9 now we're going to talk about a little this afternoon I hope we get to it on knowledge now remember when we we talked a little bit Wednesday night about knowledge you're going to have to pull knowledge apart because there's Holy Ghost knowledge and there's Satan's knowledge all right right here they are right here in the Book of Genesis and out of the ground Genesis 2:9 made the Lord God to grow every tree that's Pleasant to the sight and good for food and I stop that's natural food that's that's apples oranges pears whatever that grows on a tree now nuts fruits and all that is everybody with me now these two trees he's fixing to talking about talk about here they're not natural trees all right cuz there's that little pause to stop he says the tree of life also in the midst of the Garden or in the middle and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so there's two trees there one of them God told if you eat off this tree you'll live if you eat off this tree you're going to die all right so there's no in between you're eating off today you've walked into this church and you're eating off one of the two now I know for a fact that you and I have to look and you drove in on the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil most of y'all that got in your hand right now a lot of evil your cell phone well get quiet on me would you but that's where it come from but you know what God is so much smarter than Satan he'll just let Satan just bring all this out and then he'll just use it for the glory and honor of the Lord he'll just use it for you to call and pray for somebody or text somebody hey I'm praying for you I appreciate you I love you and then people can say hey please pray for me where you don't have to get on the phone and do it you know 30 or 40 times you just throw a little WhatsApp out there or or Marco Polo and and you can uh you can get to a lot of people that can start praying really fast and we appreciate that so so Satan slipped into God's Eden but you know what God slipped right into Satan's Eden and started using what he's already had off that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil to what to help us eat off the tree of life cuz who is the tree of life not a tree remember it's not bark and Roots it's Jesus Christ he's a root and offspring of David a root that comes out of the stem of Jesse amen a branch he's talked about many many times being in a tree and that's why they H they hung him on a tree all right cuz he was the tree of life so Isaiah 28:9 says Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine who them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast all right now I had a little milk this this morning with my toast and egg but I'm not going to have that again this afternoon I'm going to have some sweet tea and some Bruns with stew got a lot of meat in it that was good last night that wedding we were at so anyway y'all can watch us eat it um Isaiah 53 now watch look yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him we know who this is talking about talk about Jesus Christ he has put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin his soul the real being of his all right he shall see his seed which was his progeny his children all right he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many so there's not anything wrong with God's knowledge because we're going to have to look at knowledge on the pyramid and that has nothing to do with God's knowledge the knowledge of God Is So opposite of Science and all this out in the world until it's just night and day difference but sometimes man can't tell the difference between the two because the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is so enticing it's so go it's just beautiful you know Jesus wasn't very beautiful when he was hanging on the cross but he was saving your soul and my soul amen by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities now how we going to see that we Bible's talking about this morning there is one truth there is not a truth there is one truth and it is Jesus Christ Thy word is true this Bible is true there's not anything in here that's wrong there's not an era in it there's not a denomination in it there's not 14,000 different ideas in it but man off the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil has been eaten and he has been eating to what to discredit this right here now I say man I say Satan through man right listen you don't come up with ideas of your own you're in influenced and then you make a decision everybody with me you you are influenced and then you make a decision all right so what are we going to do we're going to we're going to the Bible even tells us this try the spirits try the Worden come and see taste and see that the Lord is good you can eat off the world's tree or you can eat off eat off God's tree one of the two all right but he says sanctify them who's them us through thy truth Thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world so even I also sent them into the world God didn't save us and put us in a bubble and say all right you stay right here he said so let your light shine among men shine among men that's right and for their sake I sanctify myself Jesus Christ talking about himself that they also might be Sanctified what through a truth through the truth amen all right now we know that for the ones that's that's just here today sanctification we know that word we've always call called it sanctification but really it's a compound word that means you're you're cleaning something up and you're putting it aside for service you're not putting it in service yet it's like it's like washing the washing the glass the glass was dirty and filthy and and like you in the world and God picked you up out of the out of the mud he justified you he said I'm going to use this glass I'm going to use this person but you're still really dirty inside you got mud in you you got sticks and you got all these different things but then God takes you by the washing of the water of the word come to church come to church and let the what let brother Brown say get them under the fountain what is a fountain it it's not it's a fountain coming from that tree of life a fountain flowing with living water that's what Jesus says that I'll give you living water you don't worry about this well I'm going to give you something that'll never run dry right so what is he doing that means that he takes that word and washes us cleans us up cleans the glass and he didn't want to drink out of it yet he's going to put it here and then he's going to decide what he's going to do with it everybody with me he's going to decide what to do with this glass he's either going to let it fall back into the dirt CU remember still your free more ageny you can fall right back into the dirt and you get all covered with mud again cuz remember the unclean Spirit goes out of a man walks in dry places seeketh rest findeth none cometh back and brings more mud brings more sticks brings more junk of the world and then the person is seven times worse than he started but if you'll get yourself Sanctified cleaned up and set aside for service then what's going to happen is God's going to come into your soul and he's going to what he's going to cap it off or seal it off so that it won't get out all right this can get out now look mm but when I close it up it won't that's what God wants to do to give you the Holy Ghost he wants to drive the unclean Spirit out that's why we don't act like the world listen we don't we should we should not even think like the world they're thinking to do this and thinking to do that and thinking to smoke and drink and curse and do all the different things that's what they're thinking that's their motive and objective it's what the God of this evil age they're ready today this Sunday we got ready to go to church they got ready to play football they put their favorite hat on they put their favorite uh jacket on some of them didn't put on nothing at all cuz they're going to they're going to tape their favorite football team over around on their chest and get shown on on ESPN that's what the world thought we've never none I hope none of y'all ever thought that but if you did the altars open I come on Sunday to listen to the word of God it's not a day that all everybody plays football and that I enjoy that part all right I said I was going to do it but I'm going to say it anyway I get in trouble so I'm going to say it anyway I looked the other day you know Georgia won the SEC Championship you know I remember one point you know so I did watch the game uh later we were here I watched it afterwards so they showed a little snippet the next two or three days on YouTube of people in their room in their house and they were videoing it with their boy shaking his head teren is too I think you there they're they're they're in their living room and everybody's glued to the television and as soon as that feeli goal was missed where Georgia beats Ohio State I'm not taking anything red with me up there I'm going to Ohio tonight so I'm not going to take anything red I'm I don't want to get shot so uh so anyway we're just human beings but you see those people they're they're anticipating something kind of like you are now you're anticipating something but buddy as soon as that guy from Ohio State hooked that field goal and Georgia won I wish some of y'all would act like that we'd Lisa would really have to clean up then they were throwing stuff beating each other up jumping over couches for a ball game why can't we do that for the spirit of God and let God have his way one day and let us do that let us be under anticipation and be sitting there under anticipation Hey listen you got to be watching the game to know what happened you got to be in church you got to know what you're doing with the word of God to be happy about when some incident happens that what the emotion just starts flowing all right and and it did with them and just I mean if you well looking at you go these people are crazy they're just idiots but that's the way we acted when we were out in the world we did the same identical thing all right jump up and down let's jump up and down for Jesus let's get something a little bit Eternal on our mind all right but what's God tell us I'm moving right along I'm just I'm just human what was the whole deal it was obeying what God Said to do which brought our power it brings our power now is doing what obeying what God Said to do what brought virtue is obedience to the word of God all right now look we know and we we don't know if our brothers talked to brother Donnie much but we believe God in the end time sent us a prophet he sent us somebody and people have a problem with prophets I don't because the Bible's full of them Paul was one Peter James John all the different ones uh job Isaiah um all the ones in the Bible Paul they were all prophets and they have no world has no problem with them because they're they're way back under but when you get in their face and tell him God sent a prophet according to Malachi 4 according to Luke 17:30 and he was Vindicated to take this Bible and give us the truth not a truth not 70 different translations or 7,000 different translations one translation all right so we believe and that's why we quote him because we believe as others quote Charles Stanley as others quote nothing wrong with these guys as others quote John haggy and the different ones McCarthy Oh They'll quote them all day long Spurgeon they'll put it up on the screen they all Quote Spurgeon and which are great men but they didn't all have the truth that's right they had a truth they were for their time they they you will see them in heaven Dwight Moody you will see him in glory but he didn't have the message of the hour he was not a Vindicated scriptural Prophet we believe that William Brandon was a scriptural Prophet because he he he he just fit the mold of everything God said we needed in the end time he fit it and I believe it all right so this is what he said he said we're not building an organization I'm not here that's morning to build an organization Christ never sent me to build an organization Christ sent me to build build individuals all right if you want to drink milk that's okay that will sustain you but it will not make you grow in Grace and knowledge grow in strength and virtue and different things that they might be the PowerHouse you know if you take little axle and you just keep giving him milk and giving him milk giving him milk and he's 14 years old and you don't give him nothing but milk he'll be malnourished that's the same way you are in the gospel there's a birth you and I are birthed into this gospel by the New Birth by the holy ghost coming into our soul changing our life changing who we are and then what happens we have we're a baby we cry and say God please give me I I you don't remember that but you know what a little bit later on my kids are are almost 40 and whoa 37 they better not come crying to me for some little something uhuh I say grow up boy that's what God says though he tells us he says grow up boy grow up girl you need to grow up all right quit doing these things I'm over and over again I'm doing this stuff for you grow up all right that they might be the what he's going to build individuals not just build them and they sit there they're going to be a what a Powerhouse and the dwelling place of the spirit of God by his word by his word see build up the individual to that place and we believe we talking about the word Virtue virtue is strength it's something that comes from inside of you and it is pushed out it's like I said many times before um Logan if I need somebody to pray for me I'm not going to the drunk I'm not going to the mechanic I'll go to the mechanic if I need my car fixed because I don't have a clue how to fix my car I know how to go key turn and after that it's yours all right I don't even want to pretend that I know how to fix a car amen so I don't but now if I need something from God I don't go to the mechanic I go to where there's strength I go to where I can draw something out of I go to God all right so should you you should go to God and not have to go to all these other things then the prophet of God tells us his virtue anyone knows what the word virtue means see and we must have it if virtue went from him to heal the woman that was sick then really it didn't have anything to do with him being a virgin we know he was but it didn't have nothing to do with him being a virgin it's because there was power and that word power means dunamis or where we get the word Dynamite which that's the power of the holy ghost in a believer that we cannot keep it with us that we give it out that we can what preach the unreachable unsearchable reaches of God to who to each other and to this world this world will never hear about Jesus Christ unless do you never all right he's expecting the same virtue in his church because he was our example and if he had virtue to give to the people he expects us to have virtue to give to the people and what is virtue virtue is strength or power today we came to what as this next word said we came to what pull on God we came to pull on a gift that God give me give you give brother Joe give all the different ones to what to break the spell of what you've had all week oh so y'all been okay all week well pray for me I I got dumped on and so did Brother Boyd he's got his hand up twice but what brought us here we knew we could get strength here we knew you get we could get virtue here it was a pull it was pulling us and we know that the prophet had three pulls in his life or what to what to perform or carry out to draw the supporter attention of and the first pull was what he he would show his hand he would hold somebody's hand and there would bumps go across his hand and he would tell them that they were sick through looking at the hand flesh then the next pull or the next part of his ministry was he would literally bring people up to the platform and he would tell them where they came from what their mother's name was what how many times hundreds of thousands of times never been wrong one time he'd tell you he say I see a doctor with a clipboard in his hand he's blond and he's got on glasses how detailed is that he was looking at the thing he wasn't guessing he was looking at the vision of you at the doctor's off he said oh I see you grabbed your side he said oh it's cancer in your in your in your kidney or something you know he'd tell them what it was and then he' say if you believe all things are possible and we see a lot of we saw a lot of people we have some in our Sanctuary today that were in those meetings that saw those things happen and we still see them happen you know that's okay to live to no it's not I'm sorry it's not it's not okay to live back there we need to have an updated Revelation to where we can see those things happen all right the discernment coming forth from the word of God now not so much as a prophetic gift cuz that gift was brother B said one to a generation is't know what he said one to a generation that kind of gift but you and I are what we are we are require ired to have gifts of the Spirit so we all can have a gift and a gift of discernment and different things of V of wisdom and faith and all the speaking in tongues and interpretation so the second pull or the second part of his ministry pulled out the virtues in brother Brandon because remember when he would stand in that line and there'd be 20 or 30 people and and he would he would tell them who they were and tell them what their what their uh issue was about 20 or 30 people later he was totally exhausted why because his Humanity was being used by God and and those people were pulling the virtue out of him and he would actually collapse because of that but we come now to where we're going to get to a little bit later on is the opening of the word or the Seven Seals we'll not talk on that too much today because it we need to stay like we need to stay all right everybody good so what today was as I was thinking the other day that we quote a lot of things we quote that we don't explain all right CU remember we've quoted the quote this messenger of Malachi 4 would do two things remember turn the hearts of the fathers to the children I mean to the CH children to the fathers and then open the Seven Seals well we just kind of throw that out there all right well I'm going to try to help us understand cuz don't show your hands but how many of you really know when we say the faith of the fathers can you explain what that is can you really explain when I say we've got to get back to the faith of well if I explain something and you don't know what the faith of the fathers are how do you know you got back there how do you know those things are working in your life if you don't know what the faith of the fathers is now the fathers is what those saints that were way back 2,000 years ago they saw the Lord Jesus most of them did they got the Holy Ghost right there on the day of Pentecost and they were the fathers of the Gospel all right John was during that period of time and John would take he was taking the the Old Testament the old Saints and he was showing them a new way right everybody with me say Amen Behold the Lamb of God that take he didn't say Behold the Lamb that cus is going to put on the altar is that okay if we go this way today it's okay I feel like we're led to go this way he didn't say Behold the Lamb that cus is going to put on the altar that's going to forgive your sins just for one year if you're a liar you're going to still be a liar if you're a thief you're still going to be a thief but God covered you by that blood but when you turn to the New Testament we knew that the Bible told us that a virgin shall conceive and that we would have somebody come that would be a counselor the Prince of Peace the Mighty God I read to you there and if you want to read who Jesus Christ is read that book that I told you about you go into Isaiah 53 and you see what he did for us so what was John doing John wasn't in the Old Testament but he was pointing them from the faith right gu everybody with me all right from them he's going to turn them to a new gospel Behold the Lamb of God it takes away the sin of the world and this Jesus comes along and as Jesus comes along that Faith starts building in those fathers right they've got these virtues working in their life Silver and Gold Have I None read the book of Acts and as brother Bob was talking about Discerning whether somebody was holding back a few dollars cost them their life but that was discernment during that faith of the fathers but now remember that got well I'm not going to read it but it says you've lost your first love what happens man starts getting involved involved and starts making denominations and tearing the word apart ain't that what Satan's job is is to tear it apart God is to build a church Satan is to tear it apart all right so look let's watch this right here just for a second then let's stop in the layout of see in church age the prophet of God said this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations is going to do two things now I'm I'm going to make this into two parts CU I want to explain this quote all right let him praise the Lord all he wants to I wish some people we've got some people never even uttered that their whole time in this church one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers all right where were the fathers the fathers were way back 2,000 years ago the faith of the fathers in other words the what the foundation of the church the real Church the foundation let me say brother Michael of the Bride church not just the church the church comes through all through that but the bride continues through all right everybody with me so Malachi 4 is going to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers because the children have got down to be nothing but just babies and they they accept water baptism in the name of the father son Holy Ghost which is false they accept that there's hell is eternal which is false see all these false doctrines that they that they uphold saying that it's Doctrine and it's not right amen so somebody God's got to use human flesh he's not coming back here himself and stand on the earth until everything's done and wiped out he said I'm going to do it through my people that's right and the Word was made flesh your flesh amen Satan will be conquered by you Devil's I mean Jesus has already conquered him kicked him out of heaven right he just wants us to do it in flesh cuz Satan said I'm going to weaken this whole group I'm going to put them in flesh they can't stand it they can't stand to God's word they can't stand up to the to the trials of Life they can't look what I did to Eve I only told her just a few words and the whole world fell that's what he's thinking about me and you he's thinking he can whip us because of our weakness in the flesh and oh my I'll tell you week to week it looks like it sometimes everybody with me well for all you that don't have no problem pray for us to do if you don't have a problem in life I think the devil may already have you hello somebody so the Revelation that brother brandham was to bring are this messenger of Malachi 4 according to what we've been talking about he brings us a reev ation of who the Son of God is Jesus walking on the face of the Earth he was the son of man he was God in human flesh but now we come to this place to where there's a revelation the prophet says through the church ages of the Son of God which means that there can be now listen to me real real careful there can be some error in that not in God not in the word but in man God accepted Luther's light as truth of a father son Holy Ghost baptism but what was inside of Luther didn't believe that kind of a paradox there you think well how can that happen well that's how strong the devil is folks That's How Strong the devil is getting into a church and tearing a church apart I'm not talking about this church I'm talking about church world all right trying to tear the bride up and he what did he do he did just like he did in heaven he told his Tale yeah that's right remember he told his tale to those angels and a third of the Angels came with him he's a real good preacher if you don't understand what I'm talking about he's not something that sits around with horns and it's red and got a tail no he's going to tell you a tail all right it's going to be a lie but the devil is beautiful the Bible says Satan was Lucifer was the most beautiful angel and he still is today cuz he'll throw you beauty more than he will to obey the word of God Amen that's right CU as we've always said there's a lot of things in the word of God that we do that the world says oh we don't have to do that we don't have to do that to be a Christian we don't what do you mean you got to what do you mean about this pants and cutting hair and all that you'll learn that later on but it's in the Bible it's in the Bible that you don't do it somebody had to tell you you could do it and it wasn't God God so it had to be what man had to be the devil so the devil's here I mean he he came to church he got here before y'all did amen I hope you didn't bring him with you but he got here before you did so the revelation of the Son of God that when the master Malachi 4 is going to do two things number one he's going to what turn us back to the faith of the fathers the faith of the fathers is what the statute of a perfect man working in our life Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience guess brotherly kindness but now remember you got to stop there where it says love cuz that wasn't in the church ages that kind of love now the love of God was but not that kind of love everybody with me cuz here's the second one cuz the third pull is or the third part of his ministry was he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 now look John saw them but couldn't write them right mystery keep it so there is something there it's not just something floating around in the air there was something John saw and God said or the Christ that angel which was Christ said no seal it up John Till the time of the end but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel that's where we believe that our Prophet come and got involved in the word of God so in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals see the Seven Seals now let let me not make it so strong I don't mean the Seven Seals don't have anything to do with the Statue of perfect man but you can come to Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness without even knowing what the seals are Paul didn't know anything about seals John's the only one that really wrote anything down about him but now look the word of God though is like a puzzle you have to fit that puzzle together Paul spoke about the seals John spoke about the seals Peter spoke about about the seals everybody spoke Matthew Mark Luke and John they all spoke of it but it took a prophet in the end time to what pull them together so it pulled it together what it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn what the hearts of the children us that are born again in the message to grow in Grace and knowledge not old Pentecost the first part of brother Brown's Ministry was to get old Pentecost babbling bunch of babies to establish the faith of the fathers establish what had been lost for 2,000 years he was establishing that during his first part of his ministry 47 and about 1963 is everybody with me now listen we're not a church that believes you need to throw your books away before 1963 you will never understand a seals without that Foundation of 1947 to 1963 if you don't understand what I'm talking about that was when brother Brown started preaching and then in 1963 in other words 61 or two he says I'm fixing to enter into a new phase of my Ministry all right and that new phase had never been since Jesus Christ was on the face of the Earth that new phase was just for me and you sitting here today he missed the field goal that's what you should have said the devil missed the field goal and we win okay so that's for us it's the seals and you see you see what God for the seals are the son of man Revelations which we had got to yet but we got to have all this Foundation to get to hear because remember that was what was rejected who was the chief headstone it was the Lord Jesus they didn't understand all about him walking around in flesh and he was almighty God not just a piece of God he was God right everybody with me they couldn't understand that so that was a mystery so so um irenius could say no he was God and then sthus could come along another minister in the gospel another message believer come on somebody he was a preacher but he was preaching that it was what a light substance of God so that carried into 325 ad brother R said said a lot of old prophets and a lot of what a lot of people that had the truth went to n but there was so much overwhelming power of the devil is everybody with me with this that sound familiar it's what's happening now the overpowering power of the devil in the men change their Doctrine change their Doctrine to say well I think we'll just take father son Holy Ghost that's what Jesus said in Matthew yeah I know it's what Jesus said in Matthew but the name he was talking about is in Acts 238 right cuz what is the name of the father and the son and Holy Ghost the Lord Jesus Christ I would not give somebody the keys to my house if I didn't think they can handle it right would you no but sure enough Jesus gave the keys to Peter and said whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven whatever you loose on Earth I'll loose in heaven so on the day of Pentecost Peter loosed a Doctrine and man took it immediately and flipped it around oh we'll take this over here so that see the so the seals are the revelations um four five six seven and eight all that in there was for the son of man coming back in the end time the chief headstone which what he's what's he going to do here he's going to carry us out of here all right the Lord Jesus is going to come back he's already here but he's back in his bride now he's in Bride form he wanted that cuz look what it says look the evening messenger this is 1963 this is uh right before the seals are preached actually one6 1963 seals were preached in March right so look bring back the church to the word now what is this messenger of Malachi for to do restore back the original Faith the resurrection Faith what was the sign of the Resurrection The discernment right yeah that was the sign of the son of man cuz that's what the sign of the son of man is now brother Brown stood years and years and years he said this is the sign of the son of man that discernment would go forth Sarah in the tent behind laughing and him knowing what was going on look restore back the original Faith the resurrection Faith cuz remember they didn't have a resurrection faith not all of it right man immediately said no let's let's just make it this let's let's say well we can be a Baptist and we can be a Methodist and we can be a Pentecostal and we can be a a presbyterian and and you know each one's got their own little caveat that they can do you know Presbyterian Presbyterian you can drink a little you know and the Baptist they don't mind you smoking a little but don't drink and the Presbyterian says well we can have a little we can have a little alcohol we not want to smoke well that ain't got nothing to do with the Bible right if get the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul they kick both of them out so who's right the Holy Ghost is right not to smoke and drink and cussing listen that's not sin sin is you not believing that the word of God can take out out of your life that's right I'm telling you I didn't smoke but I chewed to M it since I was 14 years old played baseball and I went through I'm talking about Red Man switched over to Levi Garrett when it was two for one dip snuff but the day God saved my soul right here the day God saved me my wife's a witness I had it all over the house I had it in the car I owed it to people you know how you do sometimes you know cigarette yeah man you got a cigarette yeah here take a pack well I had people that I owed Che and tobacco to so I went and bought it for them I did because I owed it to them you strange well this is family here okay I'm y'all call Daddy strange about some things he did so it's I the same way but you know what that desire of doing that went away and I've never had that desire again I've had that temptation but I've never had that desire to put that junk in my mouth amen same way with alcohol same way with women same way what it was just unbelief I didn't believe God's word could do that to me but when I become a Believer that's why they call it Believers when I become a believer old things passed away that old clean unclean spirits went out of me I didn't want to do that anymore you know why cu the want to do it left and then what the want to do the will of God Came In Praise the Lord bring back the church to the word now what is this m of Malachi for to do restore back the original faith that they seen Jesus after he had raised from the dead seen him working among them they were men of few words they went forth and preached the word oh look I'm going to read this one I didn't put it red but I'm going to read it anyway oh they preached long well don't get quiet Paul preached All Night One Time make the visors nervous Paul preached all night one time and you know what a man fell asleep some of y'all if y'all was on the building we'd be praying for you too a man fell out of the building and killed himself he laid his body over him Paul did and brought him back to life you know why if I'd have been Paul I just said that was my fault that was my fault he went to sleep but boy the word was so good and y'all was amening amen and amening and he just noded off and fell out the window and then Paul went down there and laid on his body on him and what brought him right back to life amen so don't get scared we can pray for the sick if y'all fall asleep and fall out of the chair in the loud of seean church age this is 1960 this is a couple years before the seals and the Heart of the children to the fathers now when this great Elijah comes in the end of this age he'll be taking the message of Pentecost look to turn the children what Pentecostal children Pentecostal speaking in tongues all that is is speaking in tongues you speak in tongues you got the holy ghost that is not true devil speaking in tongues all right he'll take the message of Pentecost to turn the children to the faith of the fathers because he'll be rebuking them because they didn't keep this same faith that was in the beginning all right there's the faith of the fathers the faith of Paul irenius John Matthew Luke all the different ones all right read the book of Acts that's where it be here rebuke him because they didn't keep this same faith that was back there in the beginning amen now I believe we pretty well realize it's going to be Elijah don't we now we know it and there he was standing talking to us all right the spirit of Elijah brother Brown wasn't Elijah he had the spirit of Elijah on him because God promised he'd send the spirit of Elijah in the end time according to Malachi 4 1961 Abraham's Covenant confirmed brother B said look and notice here the first Elijah was to come or El he would turn the hearts of the children well he he messed up he's he said the hearts of the fathers to the children what see the old patriarch fathers the old Orthodox the legalist the law he turned it back to the faith of the fathers here to the children what the new aged Behold the Lamb of God like I said before that takes away the sin of the world get the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's not going to be just an anointing it's going to be a filling and it's going to be uh God entering into a person and the work not just anointing him the faith of the fathers here to the church the hearts of the children this new message that John was preaching see of the coming Messiah at hand he turns the hearts to this but now watch the next time John appears he turns the hearts he meant he meant Elijah you know that he turns the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers so it'd be back to the original message and you'll know when it gets here a lot of people didn't folks but you'll know when it gets here it's here right it'll be a restoration to send that lukewarm leosan church back to that original Faith back y again yes sir and he will be anointed to do so when this Elijah comes he'll be a prophet he will pull no punches he will cut right and left what's he talking about restoring Joel promised it right Joel 2:25 says I will restore who God will restore to you the years that the Locust eat canle worm caterpillar pal worm these are all the same bug eating on the same tree right my great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied well now remember this is after the restoring read restoration of the Bride tree he got eat down to a stump they wasn't much life but you can't kill God can't kill God you make it look you say well where's God he's in his people amen he's not in your government he's not in your gas tank he's not in the car you drive or he's not even in your place of work right if you're at your place of work God's there that's why folks I'm telling you when this world when the bride leaves this world think about the absolute C that's going to come on this Earth that's right family will be against family they'll fight each other it's coming don't worry and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed that's you perfect man that's where brother rown talks about one little nod just a little nod from God that's all God had to do then nothing's going to stop them they didn't question and study at hum Hall and worry like we do whether we should do this or that they went ahead and done it anyhow just one little nod from God that done it just as soon why how could they know it was a nod from God they had these virtues in them that's right that's right all these qualifications and the first little nod of God compared with every bit of this and with his word they knowed it was the word of God and away they went don't have to worry about nothing else when God spoke it they went and we're going to read this right here probably going to stop right here so we will uh pick this up a little bit later on or this afternoon um a virtuous woman is what a crown to her husband but she that maketh she that maketh ashamed is rotness and his bone folks God's going to have a bride he's got one now she's virtuous sinless he has we have been washed we have been changed back what's inside listen you may not be a virgin in your flesh but God can make you a virgin in your soul amen that's right brother Bri said a woman can be forgiven but you can't be justified once you lose your virginity it's gone all right but but but thank God for God that calls you now by the new birth he has changed you to a virgin in your soul you can't be a virtuous you can't be a virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ without it a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband but she that maketh ashamed is rotness to the Bone listen the pro the prophet of God and the word of God in the first church age he said you have become nicians and I hate you do we not need to read that we read it last Wednesday night God said you've left your first love that's right he said but you also what I have that you have I I appreciate you hating the nician spirit like I hate it so what's he doing now a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband all those seven Church agents under their messenger were a crown to Jesus Christ but the ones that were outside of that he was ashamed of them God's ashamed of me and you when we do things wrong but there's something there's an anchor that holds inside we're human beings on the outside folks we know that we fall we make mistakes but if you got a toost if you got a Rudder under that ship of yours that spiritual Rudder will tell you what to do that spiritual Rudder will tell you not to put that cigarette in your mouth not to put that dip of tobacco not to say those bad words we used to say because what is it it's the spirit of God how can I be a Christian and not act a little bit try to act a little bit like a Christian or like God that's right yeah but you this easy we all sin and come short of the glory of God but down inside your soul is something that they don't have it's something that if you do fall it'll pick your highend back up and you'll go do something good I'm a Christian I'm not I'm not not counting the ways that I am and the ways that I ain't you shouldn't either that's right brother Bram said what did he say he said the the mark of a True Believer was that they get back up and start but you know what if you fall and stay there you want a Believer to begin with a Believer will fall and get back up and say God forgive me of that I won't do that no more that's right and then continue on CU you know what the devil's going to train all his guns on us listen to this real quick and we'll close a virtuous woman in other words the bride of Christ cares for her family she's a hard worker while she TOS faithfully and meeting the needs of her own family she also doesn't forget to help the other needy people God brings across her path a virtuous woman also takes the time to look after her own health and be a good Steward of her body where the Body of Christ right so our virtuous woman meaning applies to the heart and then to every area of Life Paul says life and godliness all right this should this should help us live life a lot better as we were saying before you know what it would be if everybody was a born- again Christian there'd be no divorce court there'd be no divorce lawyers praise God there'd be no liquor store on the side of the road I mean there'd be no alcoholic laws there'd be no DUIs there'd be no Police Department Well we'd have deacons but that's where it's going to be in a new Heaven and new earth isn't it you ever thought about that I mean listen we're still in humanity we're stuck brother John in humanity but we still have a quality that I don't need a DUI a DUI Law to change for me to get up UPS ET about it right I don't I don't have to have a divorce court change the law and me get upset about it do you cigarettes are $5 a pack now so don't bother me anymore but you hear the world that's all they're saying right I'm going to go buy some lottery tickets so I can pay for these I'm just saying by being born again bride of Jesus Christ it automatically makes you think different and it automatically separates you from the world you mean you don't cuss no more no I don't cuss no more I used to cuss a lot cuz the cusser is not in me anymore the cusser died I didn't say kuster I said cusser if kuster was a cursed kuster he died too so but it applies to the heart look and then every area of your life you don't need a fresh air um uh what you call them things um diffuser to cover up the cigarette smoke cu the preacher coming into your house come on somebody that ashtray is full I don't I Ain had one in my house in 50 years so why that father me you understand what I'm saying you say oh brother wait we got problems yeah we got problems I'm telling you you you you rub shoulders with the world out there right you do and you see what they're going through sure we're having issues sure we're having problems but my heavens we have got a place to go we've got a man we can talk to we've got a holy ghost filled group of people that we can bind together and not bind together and say I slipped up and had a couple of drinks other day I'm not going back to Alcoholics Anonymous this is not Alcoholics Anonymous this is not Reformation this is restoration restoring it back to where little Axel there hadn't smoked a cigarette his whole life has he bless his heart he had drunk drunk a drink alcohol has he hadn't said a cuss word has he let's get back to that well remember we're born babes in Christ well the reason we're born babes in Christ is we don't done that stuff yet but now you let him get 13 14 years old and listen to the world say these things and do these things we're influenced by this outside world let's stand to our feet a virtuous woman the Bride come on musicians goes in the strength of the Lord and Faithfully completes whatever task he has for her to do now what's our task our task is to go to a body change our task is not just to be Christians and live out our life and and and and die and and you know go to the other side it's for us to live so close to God that Satan don't know what to do with us when a person is described as having virtue it is seen as a quality that sets one apart look apart from everyone else in character strength and morality it is a common characteristic that can be found within the mindset of several women in the Bible like Ruth Esther and Mary as well as described of others through countless verses read this and then we'll close a virtuous person exhibits The Joint Excellence of reason and character we a even got the knowledge yet but that has a lot to do with that that's why knowledge is right these things are right exactly where they need to be you got to have Holy Ghost knowledge to even know about Temperance patience godance brotherly kindness all right but you got to have virtue that strength to have the knowledge know where to go to get it the virtuous person not only knows what the good thing is to do to do is he or she is also emotionally attached to it that's what I said about the the the field goal and you know your favorite team winning uh one day we're going to realize our favorite team's already won but you know what that doesn't stop us from gloring about it cuz we don't know what the end result is exactly we do know part of it but there's still an end result that we don't know you may die tomorrow I may die to that tomorrow you may live we may be here 10 more years we don't know that but we've got a guide that we can live with and he can tell us exactly what to do you love the Lord we didn't get to knowledge but we'll get to it this afternoon but let's sing a song If you have a need altars open oh Mery it roll my [Music] God's mercy REO my life oh I [Music] should but Mercy re my love oh [Music]

but God's the Healer and that's why we take these prayer CLA that we know in the book of um of Acts that they took cloth off of Paul he was so anointed you thought about that he was so anointed that even his clothes were anointed but it was a belief that they had it was that contact we need contact with God then we take these prayer cloths and we anoint them with oil and we give them to you and we've seen cancer healed we've seen broken bones go back together we've seen people filled with the Holy Ghost we've seen you there's one standing there in the very back with the black shirt on that keeps the prayer cloth with him all the time he shouldn't actually be here amen there a lot of you shouldn't be here brother Dy different ones that are that are not here today because of coming
