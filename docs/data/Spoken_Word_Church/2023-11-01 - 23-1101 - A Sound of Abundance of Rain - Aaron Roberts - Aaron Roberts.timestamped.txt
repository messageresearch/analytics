[10:18] 18 verse 41 says and Elijah said unto
[10:23] Ahab get thee up eat and drink for there
[10:26] is a sound of abundance of rain so Ahab
[10:30] went up to eat and to drink and Elijah
[10:32] went up to the top of Carmel and he cast
[10:36] himself down upon the Earth and put his
[10:39] face between his knees and said to his
[10:42] servant go up now look toward the sea
[10:45] and he went up and looked and said there
[10:48] is
[10:50] nothing and he said go again seven times
[10:53] and it came to pass at the seventh time
[10:55] that he said behold there ariseth a
[10:58] little cloud
[10:59] out of the sea like a man's hand and he
[11:02] said go up say unto Ahab prepare thy
[11:05] Chariot and get thee down that the rain
[11:07] stopped thee not and it came to pass in
[11:10] the meanwhile that the heaven was black
[11:13] with clouds and wind and there was a
[11:15] great rain and Ahab rode and went to
[11:19] jezrael and the Hand of the Lord was
[11:21] upon Elijah and he GED up his loins and
[11:24] he ran before Ahab to the entrance of
[11:27] jezrael Amen God bless you tonight you
[11:30] can be
[11:31] seated
[11:33] and want
[11:35] to this is from the from the message the
[11:38] spiritual food in due
[11:41] season and brother Brown speaking to he
[11:44] said Abraham was Ahab was King his
[11:47] father before him had been evil ever
[11:49] since Solomon there had been there just
[11:53] been one evil king after the other and
[11:56] this man Ahab who reigned 22 years in
[11:58] Samar was the worst of all of them he
[12:01] was a real
[12:02] modernist he believed in religion
[12:05] certainly and he had everything in a
[12:07] Modern Trend he had his 400 Hebrew
[12:11] prophets all of them well schooled and
[12:13] trained God sent him one and he wouldn't
[12:16] believe it and that was Elijah Elijah
[12:19] the tishbite was a man of the Wilderness
[12:21] not a smooth man but but a rugged Man
[12:24] and one day after heab had sinned until
[12:27] God could stand it no more he spoke to
[12:29] Elijah in the
[12:30] wilderness and here he comes down the
[12:33] road to Samaria as I've often
[12:35] Illustrated maybe the white whiskers
[12:37] sticking out all around his face the
[12:39] bald head shining in the
[12:40] sun little narrow little old narrow eyes
[12:44] back there with a stick in his hand and
[12:46] a smile in his face walked right up to
[12:48] the king of Israel and said the do not
[12:50] even do will fall till I call for
[12:54] it and he and he continues on so that
[12:57] God that God had called him and dropped
[13:00] down here and he says for God would not
[13:02] let sin go
[13:04] unpunished there must be punishment what
[13:06] God what good is a law without a
[13:09] punishment what would it what would it
[13:13] do good say it's against the law to run
[13:16] the light and no fine behind it or no
[13:18] punishment behind it it wouldn't be a
[13:20] law so there's a punishment to sin and
[13:23] when God makes a law and that law is
[13:25] defied then there's got to be a
[13:28] punishment for that and he said and this
[13:30] nation had violated all of his laws oh
[13:33] they had big church they had the temple
[13:35] they had plenty of educated men they had
[13:38] prophets all over the country had
[13:39] schools of them turning them out like a
[13:42] machine and they had plenty of prophets
[13:44] had plenty of priests they had plenty of
[13:47] scribes and they had plenty of religion
[13:49] but they were away from the word of God
[13:51] so God called amen outside of their
[13:55] ranks outside of any of their ranks at
[13:58] all and sent
[14:00] him sent him in with thus saith the
[14:03] Lord and so I just want to lay that as a
[14:07] as a foundation tonight um looking at a
[14:11] few things that you know brother Brandon
[14:13] was speaking
[14:15] of uh the children of Israel and the
[14:18] Kings and the the situation that the
[14:21] country had gotten in and you know here
[14:25] they are they had had all that God had
[14:28] had blessed them with and had carried
[14:30] them all this way but when they had
[14:33] gotten away from what God had called
[14:35] them to do or God the place that God had
[14:38] called them to and and when they had
[14:40] gotten away from all of that you know
[14:44] they had all of all of the blessings of
[14:46] God and had all of the things that God
[14:48] had blessed them with but they had
[14:49] gotten away from that and had let all of
[14:53] the world come in and uh corrupt
[14:56] everything that they had and and in the
[14:58] midst of all of that but they when God
[15:00] had had done all that he could for them
[15:03] you know then it was it was time for
[15:05] judgment God had called judgment you
[15:07] know he because when when you when you
[15:10] have you see the condition that the
[15:12] world is in today and all the things
[15:14] that have happened yet God has blessed
[15:16] people and God has called people and and
[15:19] now we see that the time is of judgment
[15:22] it's it's all there is that around us
[15:25] everywhere we look but praise God as as
[15:28] we look here in the scripture when when
[15:30] God had called Elijah and had called
[15:32] Elijah to to into this position and and
[15:35] was the prophet for the day and was
[15:38] called to proclaim the word to the
[15:40] people God took care of his people and
[15:43] he took care of his Prophet when it was
[15:45] when it was time for for the word to go
[15:48] forth there was people to receive the
[15:50] word there was a group of people that
[15:52] was it didn't go to everybody but it
[15:54] went to a specific group of people to
[15:56] receive that word
[15:59] amen and and second king or First Kings
[16:03] 17 verse one says and Elijah the
[16:06] tishbite who was of the inhabitants of
[16:08] Gilead said unto Ahab as the Lord God
[16:12] the Lord God of Israel liveth before
[16:15] whom I stand there shall not be due nor
[16:17] rain these years but according to my
[16:20] word you know so when he when they had
[16:23] done all these things yet when this
[16:26] happened that of all that they had
[16:29] received and all the blessings that they
[16:31] had yet God was trying to call them back
[16:33] to the place that they ought to have
[16:35] been and then you know so when brother
[16:38] brandom said you know when when God
[16:40] gives his mercy and Grace and it's
[16:42] applied to the people when it's spurned
[16:45] then the only thing that's left is
[16:46] judgment and you know he he made a way
[16:48] but then he he continues on here and
[16:52] spiritual food and du season he said and
[16:54] and notice now how he cares for his own
[16:56] before he sent the prophet with the
[16:58] message he said Elijah go down and tell
[17:01] King King Ahab these things and now when
[17:04] you do get yourself away from him right
[17:07] quick for I have a place for you to go
[17:09] during the drought I'm going to take
[17:11] care of you Elijah if you just preach my
[17:14] word do just what I tell you to do so
[17:17] that's what he wanted he wanted he had a
[17:19] place for Elijah and they knew what was
[17:21] going to take place because in the midst
[17:24] of of the word going forth and all of a
[17:27] sudden the Judgment was going to fall in
[17:29] Israel and they were going to face the
[17:32] wrath of God the Judgment was coming but
[17:35] yet God had a place for those that were
[17:38] called and were going to heed the word
[17:41] God had a place for them to come to and
[17:43] it's what he told Elijah listen before
[17:46] before there was ever judgment coming he
[17:49] already had a place to made it was
[17:51] already a way of Escape made he already
[17:53] had him a place prepared for him before
[17:56] anything ever happened and praise God
[17:58] that's way we are today whatever is
[18:01] going to take place in the in the future
[18:03] whatever praise God we've already made
[18:05] our reservation we've already under the
[18:08] wings of the shadow of the almighty so
[18:10] whatever comes our way whatever happens
[18:12] praise God we're already protected we're
[18:15] already in the protection and before the
[18:18] wrath of God will come down praise God
[18:20] there's going to be a Rapture there's
[18:22] going to be a taken out of here because
[18:23] whatever is going to take place praise
[18:25] God we've already made our way of Escape
[18:28] because the provision has been made and
[18:31] there's a group of people that have
[18:32] already claimed
[18:34] it and they are looking for a way
[18:37] out amen and so we know here here Elijah
[18:42] and in his time when he was uh down
[18:44] there and you know he just went down
[18:45] there and he told him said listen he
[18:47] said because of the Judgment of God he
[18:49] said do won't
[18:51] fall until I call for it I'm going to be
[18:55] the
[18:56] one now brother R said that was a pretty
[18:59] amazing message to go down there and
[19:01] tell him it all rest on me but it did he
[19:04] was the prophet and it rested on him
[19:07] that he was going to be the one that was
[19:09] going to bring the Judgment because it
[19:11] wasn't it wasn't him making those those
[19:13] declarations it was the voice of God he
[19:16] was the voice of God for the day he was
[19:18] the one that was making those uh prepar
[19:21] you know those declarations but God had
[19:24] made preparation for him because when he
[19:27] went down there and in the midst of all
[19:29] this time he went down and God had made
[19:31] a had a place prepared for him and God
[19:33] took him to the brook cherith and he was
[19:35] down there and in the midst of everybody
[19:38] else in in this time frame everybody was
[19:40] wondering what was going to take place
[19:42] and all of the the the heartaches and
[19:45] the problems and all these things that
[19:47] were going on God already had a place
[19:49] for Elijah to go to he was down there by
[19:51] the Brook he had water he had he had
[19:54] provision made because the Ravens fed
[19:56] him and he was sitting down there and in
[19:58] the rest place that God had prepared for
[20:00] him that nobody else knew about but God
[20:04] had made it just for Elijah to go to
[20:06] this place and he was down there and God
[20:09] told him said you stay
[20:11] here now what what what amazing God
[20:14] tells him said you stay right here
[20:16] because I have prepared a widow woman
[20:18] for you that's going to sustain
[20:21] you on now she didn't realize where she
[20:25] was at but the word of God had already
[20:27] been proclaimed over her life she had
[20:30] already she had already because the word
[20:32] of God had already went forth and told
[20:34] her she was prospering she would
[20:37] Prosper but she didn't know that but
[20:40] somebody had to come and tell her
[20:43] that when she went down there when when
[20:46] Elijah went down there to see her you
[20:48] know she was preparing to die she had no
[20:51] hope she had nothing she was all
[20:54] everything was gone all she could see
[20:56] was everything was gone family was gone
[20:59] everything is dry there's no hope
[21:02] there's nothing we're going to die we're
[21:04] just going to make our little cake make
[21:05] our little fire and we're died we're
[21:10] GED and yet the Prophet come and spoke
[21:13] to her and said Lord can you give me a
[21:15] give me a drink of water can you give me
[21:18] a sip of
[21:19] water that's a and you know what and she
[21:22] didn't have a problem in the midst of
[21:24] her famine in the midst of her lack she
[21:26] didn't have a problem with giving that
[21:28] water but when she when he asked for a
[21:31] piece of
[21:32] bread she had a problem with
[21:35] that now I well listen sir we're we're
[21:40] we're about
[21:41] out you know we're we're scraping the
[21:44] bottom we we don't have
[21:47] anything but you know it was so amazing
[21:49] he's like I know you've just got a
[21:52] handful but just make me a little cake
[21:55] first I don't want all of it just make a
[21:58] little bit
[22:01] right and there had to be something in
[22:03] that woman to to maybe she didn't know
[22:06] who Elijah was maybe she did right we
[22:09] don't know but there was something about
[22:12] the message that he
[22:14] brought that struck a cord in her that
[22:16] she was like you know what I'm going to
[22:18] take you at your word right thank you
[22:21] Lord she made this one little
[22:24] cake when she had nothing right when she
[22:28] had reached the absolute very bottom
[22:30] that she could reach she made one little
[22:32] piece of bread for the prophet and you
[22:34] know what she was blessed because the
[22:36] rest of the time the drought was going
[22:38] on she never lost she never went without
[22:42] it never run dry she never went
[22:45] empty when it when it looks like you
[22:48] can't when when when it gets so low when
[22:50] it gets so bad see that's when that's
[22:52] when God wants you to trust him can you
[22:55] put your trust in him when it doesn't
[22:57] look like there's a way way out when it
[22:59] looks like there where it looks
[23:01] impossible but With God all things are
[23:04] possible with man it's impossible but
[23:07] With God all things are possible if you
[23:10] can put your trust in him then all
[23:12] things are
[23:14] possible see the devil wants you to
[23:16] continue to think you can't make it but
[23:19] you know what if we look in the
[23:20] scripture we've already made it we've
[23:22] already over we're Overcomers we're more
[23:24] than conquerors through him that loved
[23:26] us right that's but the devil wants us
[23:30] to think we can't make
[23:35] it but no matter what just put your
[23:38] faith in God and whatever he asked you
[23:40] to do you put your faith in him you
[23:42] trust
[23:44] him you have confidence in him whether
[23:48] it looks hard or not just trust him amen
[23:55] amen here's from the message
[24:00] respects and you you you think of the
[24:03] condition that everything was in down
[24:05] there and Israel in the the the
[24:08] condition and all at the time and
[24:10] brother Bram says could you imagine that
[24:12] little
[24:13] Jezebel with that painted up face
[24:16] stomping up and down the floor that
[24:18] little hypocrite that little that old
[24:20] hypocrite causing all these little
[24:23] children out here to suffer and all like
[24:26] that Elijah was trying to bring them
[24:28] back to God right trying to win a nation
[24:32] back to God see and look like she could
[24:35] tell the people and you mean to tell me
[24:38] that you'd believe on a man like that
[24:40] that would close the lands up like this
[24:44] and it not even rain or due and all of
[24:47] his hypocrisy or his witchcraft out
[24:49] there whatever she wanted to call it and
[24:52] he's nothing but just a witch or a
[24:54] soothsayer or something he's closed the
[24:56] heavens and it won't rain
[24:58] making all these people suffer and you
[25:01] say then that's the will of God he said
[25:04] it was the will of
[25:06] God why because God had a greater
[25:10] plan he said you must respect God
[25:13] regardless of what he does he knows what
[25:16] he's doing did did look back children
[25:19] suffering people suffering cattle dying
[25:21] sheep dying no water nowhere the nights
[25:24] was hot and sultry the sun was as bright
[25:26] as brass in the Skies through the
[25:28] daytime for 3 years and 6 months and
[25:30] Elijah sitting up there on the mount
[25:32] said not even do will fall till I call
[25:35] for call from it that's right oh how
[25:38] they hated
[25:41] him how much he was hated because of
[25:44] what but he was only proclaiming the
[25:46] word of God he was only speaking of what
[25:48] God had called him to do and you know
[25:51] there's so many people that are just
[25:52] like that today you know they spend all
[25:54] their time and and they you know they
[25:56] they want to use their carnal mind and
[25:58] they think they can figure out and
[25:59] understand the infinite of God and and
[26:01] you know but God is more infinite
[26:03] because our minds cannot understand
[26:06] because he said my ways are higher than
[26:07] your ways my thoughts are higher than
[26:09] your thoughts and you would not ever
[26:11] understand God because you don't never
[26:13] you never be able to understand the
[26:16] greatness of God but you know there's
[26:18] there's many people you know they want
[26:20] to try to figure these things out and
[26:22] they they wonder why things happen the
[26:23] way they do but God allows things to
[26:26] happen because he's he has a plan and a
[26:29] purpose that we don't understand and you
[26:31] know there's so many people out in the
[26:33] world today and it's like well how can
[26:34] you serve a God that that that allows
[26:37] all these things to happen and all these
[26:39] things because you know if God was a
[26:41] good God he would all he would take care
[26:43] of these things and why are we allow let
[26:45] all these things that have happened and
[26:47] you know all you know it's just all
[26:48] kinds of problems and you know I would
[26:50] never let this thing happen like this
[26:52] and but you know we don't understand
[26:54] because God has a plan and a purpose God
[26:57] God has has a law that's set in in
[26:59] motion and God allows men to have have
[27:02] free will and they're able to do things
[27:04] by their own self and they they allow
[27:06] things to happen and because God wanted
[27:09] things to happen a certain way because
[27:11] he's able to show himself all of his
[27:13] attributes by the things that have taken
[27:15] place and so God allows certain things
[27:18] to happen but God shows because the
[27:20] things that we suffer and the things
[27:22] that we go through in life praise God he
[27:24] shows us his greatness he shows us his
[27:26] wonder he show shows us his love he
[27:28] shows us his grace his Mercy has been
[27:31] bestowed upon us and it's been
[27:32] demonstrated why because the things that
[27:34] we've suffered the world don't see that
[27:37] but praise God we see that and he said
[27:40] you know how can you let all these
[27:42] things in in the world just falling
[27:44] apart just you know how can you say that
[27:46] all this was created by God well it
[27:48] wasn't created by God but it was set in
[27:50] motion by God but God allows man to get
[27:53] in his own way and cause all these kind
[27:55] of problems and you know that because
[27:57] God it started with man's reasoning upon
[28:00] the word and to get away from it and in
[28:02] the end that's going to be his demise
[28:05] because he's going to spend his time
[28:06] reasoning on the word he's not going to
[28:08] trust God to believe what God Said right
[28:13] you know and people oh well if God would
[28:15] you know if God could do this or God
[28:17] could do that I can't believe God will
[28:18] allow these things to happen but you
[28:20] know many times if we were to sit down
[28:22] and and look at things the way things
[28:24] are in this world you know it's like
[28:26] today if if the Lord just come along
[28:28] today and took away all the sin I'm
[28:30] sorry all the cancer let's just say all
[28:32] the cancer in the world if you took away
[28:34] every Cancer case in the world and he
[28:36] healed everybody and he done away with
[28:37] it all together and there's not every
[28:39] person that would never have any kind of
[28:41] cancer leukemia or anything nothing
[28:43] would ever show up on anybody else for
[28:45] the rest of human existence do you know
[28:48] that as soon as that would happen that
[28:50] it would just take just a few years down
[28:52] the road and people would begin to doubt
[28:54] that God ever done that that you know
[28:56] everybody say well you know what
[28:57] everybody talks about this great
[28:59] conspiracy this great conspiracy that
[29:02] took place called cancer because you
[29:04] know what I never I never had anybody
[29:06] that's ever had cancer never suffered
[29:08] from cancer you know what my parents
[29:10] never suffered from cancer nobody else
[29:12] suffered cancer my grandparents never
[29:14] saw anybody suffer from cancer so you
[29:16] know what it was just a big lie and
[29:17] everybody tries to promote all this
[29:19] stuff that took place that God killed
[29:23] cancer and you know what so all of a
[29:26] sudden people get to the point where you
[29:27] what it was just a big lie it never
[29:29] really happened just like today every
[29:31] Everything is a conspiracy theory and
[29:32] you know everybody gets so worked up
[29:34] about a lot of different things and it
[29:35] would be the same thing because if God
[29:37] removed all of that but there would be
[29:39] one group that wouldn't believe that it
[29:41] actually took place because it never
[29:44] existed but the second group that would
[29:47] come along if God healed everybody of
[29:49] cancer and done away with it the next
[29:50] thing is the next person would stand up
[29:52] and get a say well you know why why why
[29:55] are all these children around the world
[29:57] dying of hunger and why are all these
[29:59] poor things happen to these people
[30:01] around the world and next thing is why
[30:03] didn't God take care of this other
[30:04] problem and they never would ever ever
[30:08] admit that God healed cancer that he
[30:10] delivered everybody from cancer and
[30:12] nobody in the future would ever have
[30:13] that they would never ever see that as
[30:16] the work of God because all they would
[30:17] be doing is well God didn't do this
[30:20] we've got all these other
[30:23] problems look at look at all the other
[30:24] things going on in the world well if God
[30:26] was loving and and just why didn't he
[30:28] take care of these other
[30:30] problems well y'all were complaining
[30:32] that he didn't take care of cancer and
[30:33] he done
[30:36] that but they never but they never will
[30:39] admit and they never could be thankful
[30:40] for whatever God's ever
[30:42] done and they're never going to believe
[30:44] what God
[30:48] done so they they never can move beond
[30:50] beyond
[30:52] that but you know it's like well you
[30:54] know I I would I you know if it was up
[30:56] to me you know I I I just have the just
[30:58] the menpower the mental capacity we
[31:02] could just take care of all these
[31:04] problems but the problem is is it
[31:06] wouldn't do
[31:09] anything you know it's just like it's
[31:11] just like you you see kids out today and
[31:13] you know you spend they spend parents
[31:15] spend all their time and that you can't
[31:18] hurt their feelings and you and you got
[31:20] to give them everything and you got to I
[31:22] mean you just got to these precious
[31:24] little flowers these little buttercups
[31:25] you got to take care of them all the way
[31:27] that's
[31:29] right and you help them well we're we're
[31:31] helping them along we're helping them
[31:33] along we we're just we're we're just we
[31:36] don't want to we don't want to mess up
[31:37] their fragile feelings you
[31:40] know don't be
[31:43] confrontational and here here's all
[31:45] these here's all these and you you see
[31:47] these kids and they've been they've been
[31:49] ba babied and they've been petted and
[31:51] and you know they've never had to suffer
[31:53] they've never heard no they've never had
[31:55] to suffer any of these things
[31:58] do you know what you know what kids that
[31:59] do that that have had had upbringings
[32:02] like that do you know what you know what
[32:04] happens to
[32:06] them they lose their
[32:09] minds there are kids
[32:11] today that have committed
[32:14] suicide and they've had parents that
[32:17] have babied them and give them
[32:19] everything under the
[32:20] sun and you know what they can't handle
[32:25] life they don't know what hard ship is
[32:28] they don't know what disappointment they
[32:29] don't know how to handle
[32:32] that and so they if they it's like well
[32:34] you know I'm not going I'm not going to
[32:36] let them have any of these
[32:38] problems well you're not going to do
[32:39] them any good you're not helping
[32:43] them and next thing you know what are
[32:45] they doing they're out trying to find
[32:47] drugs or some kind of
[32:51] Escape he's like well you know I I I
[32:54] want to help them I I want to do
[32:55] everything I can well you're not you're
[32:56] not do anything for
[32:59] them it's just like if if you if you had
[33:02] somebody and you were like uh uh you
[33:05] know that you know the world's full full
[33:08] of homeless
[33:10] people and you have the world's full of
[33:12] homeless people and you like well I'm
[33:13] going to go help
[33:15] somebody like well you know just take
[33:18] one person off the street I'm I'm gonna
[33:19] try to help
[33:21] them well you know what if they don't
[33:23] want help you're not going to help
[33:25] them
[33:27] you can give them everything do
[33:28] everything you can and try to help them
[33:30] and and and what and then it's like and
[33:33] if if you went out there and so well you
[33:35] ain't got clothes brother let me buy you
[33:37] some clothes well what if they took
[33:39] their clothes and sold them and took the
[33:40] money that's right if you tried to buy
[33:43] them a place to live or or anything else
[33:45] everything that you give to them they
[33:48] destroy it sell it whatever get rid of
[33:52] it I mean how many how how long would
[33:55] would it take before then well you know
[33:57] what we just going to give them
[33:59] more no a lot a lot of these people that
[34:02] that well well we just want to we just
[34:03] want to pour money everybody and and do
[34:06] all this and do all
[34:08] that well you know what you you can't
[34:10] you can't money money don't fix
[34:13] problems there's a lot of problems in
[34:15] this world you know what it's been more
[34:17] money has caused more problems exactly
[34:21] absolutely just added more problems to
[34:23] the
[34:24] situation you know like the old is you
[34:27] can't buy
[34:30] friends because you know what if you can
[34:32] buy a friend for $5 the person that's
[34:34] got $6 you've lost your
[34:39] friend and that's all it
[34:42] takes sometimes only takes five and a
[34:44] quarter and they're
[34:47] gone but you're not but you're but you
[34:49] know it's like well we're just going to
[34:50] give no you can't you can't do
[34:54] that and everybody's like well we just
[34:56] want to we just we just pour our hearts
[34:58] out to these
[34:59] people yeah I feel sorry for a lot of
[35:02] people and I'd like to help and I you
[35:04] try to help people but you know what
[35:05] there's a there's a a point that your
[35:08] investment there's no return on your
[35:11] investment and you also have to have
[35:14] some kind of of discernment on these
[35:17] things it's like because if you're going
[35:19] to help somebody and they're not going
[35:21] to take your help then you know what you
[35:23] helping them has become a detriment to
[35:25] them right man that's right and then all
[35:28] of a sudden people like well I can't
[35:29] believe they done me that
[35:31] way well you should have known ahead of
[35:34] time it was going to be like
[35:37] that I mean the writing was on the
[35:41] wall and so it's the same way with God
[35:44] when when God wanted to help people and
[35:46] try to do his word is is his is his law
[35:50] and it's the way of his provision and
[35:52] the way everything is applied and
[35:54] supplied is through the word right and
[35:57] God has a law and if you operate by the
[35:59] law of God then you reap the benefits of
[36:02] it and that's the that's the whole thing
[36:05] is it operates by a law
[36:08] right and in the whole world and you
[36:10] can't change that you can't get away
[36:13] from that if you you have to know what
[36:14] the law of God the way the law
[36:23] works you know just even in the natural
[36:27] in the natural world how how everything
[36:30] works by the law of
[36:34] God you know I mean you you you set
[36:36] something up on a ladder you walk
[36:38] underneath it you shake the ladder and
[36:40] it falls off and cracks you in the
[36:42] Noggin and there's like well how'd that
[36:46] happen well guess what there's a law
[36:48] called
[36:51] gravity and there's the laws of motion
[36:54] as long as you leave that lighter alone
[36:55] and don't walk underneath that it can't
[36:57] fall and hit
[36:59] you but as soon as you put your play
[37:02] self in that in that
[37:04] place then you're subject to those
[37:08] laws and you're going to and you're
[37:10] going to pay the penalty for
[37:12] it but God has also made a way that if
[37:16] you follow the laws of God then you know
[37:19] what there's blessings there amen and he
[37:22] will pour out a BL the scripture says
[37:24] that he'd pour out a blessing you can't
[37:26] contain
[37:28] what he say he said try
[37:31] me well because there's a there's a law
[37:34] that God has laid out before you if you
[37:36] will operate by that law you can receive
[37:38] right you're you're blessed by
[37:43] that but see many people have got to the
[37:46] place and and here in the scripture we
[37:47] see how they got away from the things
[37:49] that God had given them and they made
[37:52] their own way and it didn't work for
[37:54] them you know in the script scripture
[37:57] Jeremiah tells and he says Jeremiah 2
[38:01] says for my people have committed two
[38:03] evils he said they have forsaken me the
[38:06] Fountain of Living Waters and hewed them
[38:08] out sists broken ssts that can hold no
[38:14] water and so here they are the F they
[38:17] have forsaken me the Fountain of Living
[38:19] Water and you know brother Brown talks
[38:22] about in in the broken sisters how you
[38:24] know here's this clean refreshing water
[38:26] that's bubbling up and it's just so
[38:28] wonderful and here this Fountain is
[38:30] Flowing before them and here they are
[38:32] able to receive that but they've
[38:34] rejected that and heed Out
[38:39] Sisters well that's bad enough you
[38:41] trying to drink out of a sistern when
[38:43] you got water that's clear and and
[38:45] refreshing def or you can drink out of
[38:47] this bug infested sistern right I mean
[38:51] that's that's the you know that's worse
[38:53] than that but the other problem was is
[38:55] they had broken sisters that wouldn't
[38:56] hold
[38:58] water so they rejected the living water
[39:01] and they had sists that wouldn't even
[39:03] hold
[39:05] water so they even had it double times
[39:10] worse and because and here in in
[39:13] Jeremiah 3 he says because he said
[39:15] therefore the showers have been
[39:17] withholden and there hath been no latter
[39:19] rain and thou thou Hast a horse forehead
[39:23] thou refuses to be
[39:25] ashamed so here the they are when when
[39:27] the they rejected the living water but
[39:30] here the
[39:31] showers have been been withholding
[39:34] because they've turned away the word
[39:37] right it was withholding from them just
[39:40] like it was there in Israel when Elijah
[39:42] was speaking to them they had rejected
[39:44] the word of God and the the water had
[39:46] been withheld from them and it was
[39:48] because and just like it was then they
[39:50] have they refuse to be
[39:53] ashamed and all of that Death and All of
[39:56] that stuff that was going all around
[39:59] them when everything was they were they
[40:01] they were because they they couldn't see
[40:04] that Elijah was the way out that God
[40:08] that God had sent Elijah to bring them
[40:10] back but they wouldn't go forward from
[40:12] that they had rejected that and he said
[40:15] and they hated him because of what he
[40:17] had
[40:18] done and it wasn't that it was God
[40:20] trying to bring them back to the place
[40:22] they ought to
[40:24] be God's trying to bring back to the
[40:27] place where God wanted them to be trying
[40:29] to show them that God there's so much
[40:32] more that's that's greater than what
[40:33] you've
[40:35] seen and they had rejected that they
[40:38] couldn't see
[40:40] that and so brother Brandon was speaking
[40:46] here his spiritual food and due season
[40:48] you know he was talking about how he was
[40:50] type in Palestine with the United States
[40:52] and how everything had went wrong here
[40:54] in the United States and he said and
[40:56] finally the presidents or the Kings
[40:58] become become getting more rotten all
[41:00] the time and finally they ended up with
[41:02] this Ahab very type typical of our day
[41:05] and the people had gotten so modern they
[41:07] didn't want to hear the true word of God
[41:10] the true word of the Lord because they
[41:14] had gotten away from it because they
[41:15] didn't want to hear what God had to
[41:21] say no matter no matter how much you try
[41:25] to tell them what the script scripture
[41:26] says they spend all their time arguing
[41:30] and trying to tear well that's not
[41:31] that's not the
[41:33] truth you know because they spend more
[41:35] time but you know when you sat down and
[41:38] you begin to look at it and God will
[41:40] only deal with people that that want to
[41:45] hear because you know it can you you try
[41:48] to help people and try to point them to
[41:50] the scripture and even even when you you
[41:53] point out things that are right in the
[41:55] scripture that are direct ly applies to
[41:57] their their life and their
[41:59] situation they think they're somehow
[42:02] exempt then all of a sudden later on
[42:05] when you go when you bring it back to
[42:07] them and you realize that they have
[42:09] exactly the the consequence of what
[42:13] they've done they've reaped what they've
[42:15] sowed and you go back and say see that's
[42:16] exactly what you've
[42:20] done and all of a sudden when you see
[42:22] that and you take it right back and you
[42:23] point that to them and you tell them
[42:25] listen this is what you've done this is
[42:27] what's happened and they they'll turn
[42:29] their their nose up they turn their head
[42:32] they're not going to
[42:35] listen as I I was I was telling brother
[42:38] Lis Sunday when he was talking
[42:40] about trying to hold on to things people
[42:43] people want to you know you you think
[42:44] you're controlling a situation I I
[42:47] really enjoyed that what brother Luis
[42:48] had to say you're trying to hold on to a
[42:50] situation you're trying to control
[42:52] something and all of a sudden it starts
[42:54] to control you right
[42:57] and you know people people get so
[42:59] wrapped up they they're going to try to
[43:00] they want to control something and they
[43:02] want to try to guide it this way and and
[43:04] that way they're they're trying to to
[43:05] lead it a certain way because they think
[43:08] they can they can do that and all of a
[43:11] sudden one of the things that come to me
[43:13] I was telling brother Luis you know you
[43:14] see people you know because they want to
[43:16] they want to control this situation
[43:18] because lots of times people think well
[43:20] I I'm doing this for somebody's good
[43:23] because you know what they they they
[43:25] they need they need need my
[43:27] help and I'm going to control this
[43:29] situation but you know the problem is is
[43:32] later on what happens to people because
[43:34] they're they're trying to control this
[43:36] situation that sometimes you know what
[43:38] they'll do they'll tell a little white
[43:43] lie oh well you know what they would
[43:45] they wouldn't they wouldn't dare think
[43:46] about doing that but all of a sudden you
[43:48] know what well you know what to because
[43:50] I'm looking out for your good I'm I'm
[43:52] I'm going to tell you a little white
[43:55] lie oh yeah and you know what else
[43:57] they'll do they'll steal from you well
[44:00] well you know we're just we're just
[44:01] hiding that from you we're not actually
[44:03] stealing it we're just not giving it to
[44:05] you but we're doing this for your
[44:10] good and you know what I don't want you
[44:12] get too close to this that brother over
[44:14] there that that brother over you you
[44:16] need you need to watch out for him you
[44:18] know I I wouldn't I wouldn't get too
[44:20] close to him you need you need to watch
[44:24] it and you know what that is
[44:27] is somebody will murder somebody's
[44:30] influence oh I I didn't do that that
[44:33] wasn't
[44:34] me I'm just trying to I'm just trying to
[44:36] help that brother out I'm just I'm just
[44:39] trying I'm just trying to watch out for
[44:42] them because you know what I'm I'm I'm
[44:44] controlling this
[44:47] situation and then all of a sudden you
[44:49] realize well how many how many of these
[44:51] little white lies can you tell
[44:53] yeah and how far over can can you
[44:58] go and then all of a sudden it's like
[45:01] well I I'm I'm still I'm still right
[45:03] with
[45:05] God and then all of a sudden you
[45:08] realize I'm not right with
[45:11] God because there comes a time where
[45:14] you're going to face judgment for that
[45:16] sometimes the Lord will send somebody
[45:18] and all of a sudden you realize I got to
[45:19] make a
[45:20] decision I've either I've either got to
[45:23] come clean about this
[45:24] situation
[45:27] right or you know what I can I
[45:30] can go too far
[45:33] amen and you know there's there's a lot
[45:35] of people that that that they start out
[45:37] doing something they they they thought
[45:38] they were going to really help somebody
[45:41] I'm watching out for
[45:43] them and in the
[45:45] end they've irreparably damaged a
[45:51] relationship there's there's there's
[45:53] kids out there today and I mean they
[45:55] don't they don't talk talk to their
[45:58] parents they are so they are so they are
[46:00] so hurt by their
[46:02] parents and you know what and their
[46:04] parents their parents they they had all
[46:06] all the right intentions in the world
[46:09] sure but you know what you can't you
[46:11] can't control those
[46:14] situations if you're not going to be
[46:16] honest with your kids don't expect your
[46:17] kids to be honest with
[46:20] you whether whether it hurts you
[46:23] whatever it does if you can't be honest
[46:25] with your kids don't expect them to be
[46:26] honest with
[46:28] you whether you got to go back and
[46:30] apologize or whatever else you got to do
[46:32] you got to be right because you know
[46:34] what if you're not right with them you
[46:35] can't you can't be right with
[46:38] God and you know what I would I would
[46:40] much rather show my kids that I can be
[46:43] that I can ask for forgiveness that I
[46:45] can be
[46:48] wrong because you know what I'm
[46:50] human and and if and and I'm gonna make
[46:53] failures and I'm gonna have more
[46:54] failures
[46:56] but you know what there's a way that I
[46:57] can take those out we can cover
[47:02] them not try not trying to hide
[47:05] them because you're not ever going to
[47:07] ever hide
[47:10] them CU it's always it's always going to
[47:12] come out sooner or
[47:15] later just like that just like that
[47:17] woman you know she had had all all that
[47:19] all those psychiatrist and all those
[47:21] problems and you know she she had dealt
[47:23] with all that all those
[47:24] years she she had held on to all that
[47:27] all all those years and you know she
[47:29] just about lost her mind and she had to
[47:30] come see brother brandom and sister meia
[47:32] come in there and says bill you got to
[47:34] talk to this lady you need just need to
[47:35] talk to her and brother Brandon was in
[47:36] there what few minutes talking to her
[47:38] and comeing to find out oh he was in a
[47:40] car he was almost hit by a
[47:43] train it was years ago and don't you
[47:47] tell nobody about
[47:49] that I asked the Lord to forgive me of
[47:51] that years
[47:53] ago he said yeah but you didn't sin
[47:56] against God you sinned against your
[47:59] husband and that was your that was her
[48:02] problem it held her back all those years
[48:04] because she was holding on to something
[48:07] that
[48:08] happened and she thought well I'm just
[48:10] going to cover it
[48:11] up and it never did get covered up right
[48:15] and brother Brown told her said listen
[48:17] said you can go get your
[48:18] husband you you need to go get your
[48:20] husband because you know he's guilty of
[48:21] the same thing and y'all both need to
[48:24] come up you need to come here
[48:27] and that woman jumped up not my
[48:31] husband and she went got her husband he
[48:34] was guilty of the same
[48:37] thing said y'all know need to ask
[48:40] forgiveness of each other and pray and
[48:42] ask forgiveness from
[48:46] God see it was all built up because she
[48:49] thought she could handle the
[48:51] situation and she wasn't able
[48:54] to and it's the same
[48:57] way you're not going to you're not going
[48:59] to get away from the laws of God it's
[49:01] always going to be there amen
[49:05] right this is uh First Kings chapter
[49:10] 18 verse 17 it says and it came to pass
[49:14] when Ahab saw Elijah that Ahab said unto
[49:17] him art thou he that trouble Israel and
[49:20] he answered and said I have not troubled
[49:22] Israel but thou and thy father's house
[49:24] and that ye have forsaken the
[49:26] Commandments of the Lord and thou H has
[49:28] followed balam now therefore send and
[49:31] gather to me all Israel and unto Mount
[49:34] Carmel and the prophets of Bale
[49:36] 450 and the prophets of the Groves 400
[49:39] which eat at Jezebel's table so Ahab
[49:43] sent unto all the children of Israel and
[49:45] gathered the prophets together un Mount
[49:47] Carmel and Elijah came unto the people
[49:49] and said how long halt ye between two
[49:54] opinions if the the Lord be God follow
[49:57] him but if baale then follow him and the
[49:59] p and the people answered him not a
[50:04] word well you know
[50:07] what uh we don't want to get on
[50:09] Jezebel's bad side but you know we're in
[50:12] this mess over here and uh y'all going
[50:15] to have to make a
[50:16] decision one way or the other y'all
[50:18] going to have to y'all going to have to
[50:19] choose then said Elijah unto the people
[50:22] I even I only remain a prophet of the
[50:24] Lord but
[50:25] prophets are 450 men so here they are
[50:30] all these people and all these prophets
[50:32] and they had to come and and so Elijah
[50:34] made the call to him and told him said
[50:36] listen y'all going to have to make a
[50:39] decision y'all going to have to come
[50:41] because of all this has taken place all
[50:44] these three and a half years of famine
[50:47] and death and all this destruction that
[50:49] you've seen now y'all going to have to
[50:50] make a
[50:52] decision because you know what if you
[50:54] look at me I've been I'm the only one
[50:56] following the Lord but you know what
[50:58] look at the rest of you look puny almost
[51:02] dead you've buried your children look at
[51:04] your your parents are gone but look at
[51:07] me you know what I ain't
[51:12] suffering why because I'm not under the
[51:14] wrath of God why because God has made a
[51:16] way for me God's made provision for
[51:19] me why because I'm in I'm in the the
[51:22] place of safety I'm in I'm sheltered
[51:25] behind the word so now y'all got to make
[51:27] a decision are y'all going to continue
[51:29] in the way that you are going right now
[51:31] and face death or are you going to turn
[51:33] and come back to
[51:36] God because all of all of the prophets
[51:38] that you've heard before and know what
[51:40] God has done and you've seen this as
[51:42] judgment are you going to listen to them
[51:45] 450 now it's time to make up your
[51:51] mind this is from the message spiritual
[51:53] food and due season brother Bram said he
[51:55] said said so he knew that it would take
[51:57] more than just an ordinary theology he
[52:00] said it would take more than just or an
[52:02] ordinary message he said it would take
[52:04] more than just preaching the word to
[52:06] crack their Stony Hearts he knew it
[52:08] would took thus sayith the Lord to send
[52:10] that judgment down upon that people so
[52:12] he know that when he went out with thus
[52:15] sayith the Lord and it was thus sayith
[52:17] the Lord to spurn that was judgment we
[52:19] see that in our day too we see that in
[52:22] any day there's nothing left but judge
[52:25] when he step when you step over the line
[52:27] of mercy so when he sees what was taking
[52:30] place they come to that place and he
[52:32] realized that it would take more than
[52:33] just preaching the word because he came
[52:35] because that's the reason he brought
[52:36] them all to the Mount Carmel had that
[52:39] Mount Carmel Showdown he said y'all got
[52:41] to come here and make a decision why
[52:44] because he said now is the time y'all
[52:45] going to have to decide whether you're
[52:46] going to listen to them or you going to
[52:48] listen to God is God
[52:50] true he said now that type there he said
[52:53] I'm going to typ Elijah with the church
[52:55] church today the Church of today just
[52:58] before judgment he received this message
[53:01] Elijah he represented being cared for in
[53:03] the natural his natural food because it
[53:05] wasn't going to rain now according to
[53:07] the word of God for three years and six
[53:09] months or until Elijah called for it
[53:12] whatever time you say Elijah that's what
[53:15] it'll be therefore he walked up to the
[53:17] king and said there won't even be doe
[53:19] till I call for it he said that's quite
[53:21] a load isn't it that's quite a message
[53:24] he said no we're going to type that with
[53:26] the spiritual drought of
[53:28] today now we all know that we are very
[53:31] aware that there is a great spiritual
[53:34] drought in the land today spiritually
[53:35] speaking and you know that there is a
[53:38] famine in the land I'm sorry that it was
[53:40] predicted by the prophets just before
[53:41] the second coming of Christ he said
[53:44] there would come a famine in the land
[53:45] and it wouldn't be for bread alone but
[53:47] for the hearing of the word for the word
[53:50] of God and that day is now hearing the
[53:52] true word of God now this types the
[53:55] natural drought with the spiritual sin
[53:57] and unbelief by false teachers and
[54:00] modernists in the church had brought the
[54:02] place to this coming oncoming judgment
[54:06] then they had turned from God's word and
[54:08] his Prophet to a modern theological
[54:10] terms of the word so we see how you know
[54:14] because you see the way the world is
[54:17] today and
[54:19] uh you know they they have the the
[54:22] modernist and it it's really interesting
[54:24] that lots of times when you read brother
[54:26] brandom he'll always say a modern Billy
[54:30] Graham why because what what did Billy
[54:32] Graham go to he went to the world
[54:35] because they had they had their own way
[54:37] of believing and they had turned away
[54:39] from the word they had this modern way
[54:41] of thinking because there was just a
[54:43] group and when you go back and study it
[54:45] you know all of the things all of the
[54:47] Miracles that took place in the
[54:48] scripture didn't take place Jesus wasn't
[54:51] born of a virgin all the other things
[54:53] that was written in the scripture they
[54:55] don't believe any of that they've got
[54:57] they've got their own Modern Way of
[54:58] believing
[55:00] it well how in the world did a virgin
[55:06] conceive how in the world did he part
[55:09] the Red
[55:12] Sea how in the world did he open blind
[55:15] eyes they didn't believe any of
[55:21] that well Jesus was just a good man
[55:25] man Jesus was just a
[55:29] prophet some people are out there and
[55:31] they don't even believe that Jesus
[55:36] existed you know how do you how do you
[55:38] know that Jesus actually existed that he
[55:40] wasn't just some story that was
[55:42] concocted by some Hebrew
[55:48] Shakespeare and you know and well I
[55:50] don't I don't know I don't
[55:52] know you know I I I I I don't
[55:55] know I I just I I just
[56:00] wonder and so they they spend all their
[56:02] time we see they have all of
[56:06] this
[56:08] everybody's
[56:10] so
[56:12] wishy-washy there there nobody's stable
[56:15] no nobody's in a in a solid
[56:18] place and nobody nobody sees but you
[56:21] know what it's the if if God speaks to
[56:23] you
[56:25] and God God reveals himself to
[56:28] you then it's not then it's not just
[56:31] just what mama and daddy
[56:33] said Mom and Daddy may not even know
[56:35] anything about
[56:37] it but you know what if you have a
[56:39] personal experience with God when you've
[56:41] had when you've come in contact with the
[56:44] supernatural when you've had these
[56:46] things happen to you it don't matter
[56:47] what anybody
[56:49] says you know what you can you can stand
[56:51] up and you and you can bring everything
[56:53] in the world and try to convince me this
[56:55] ain't the truth well guess what you're
[56:56] you're too late to the party you're not
[56:59] going to convince me that this is not
[57:00] the
[57:01] truth
[57:03] amen see you can't you can't show me
[57:06] that it's not the truth I've already
[57:09] I've already received my
[57:11] portion I've got I've got my confidence
[57:14] and everybody else can be walking around
[57:16] in a in a drought and and they can go
[57:18] through all this and the famine and
[57:20] everything like that but you know what
[57:21] I'm feasting on
[57:23] Mana I'm I'm feting in on the
[57:28] word and this is from the junction of
[57:31] time then brother brother says and then
[57:33] just before that God brought The
[57:35] Showdown to show who was God he said
[57:39] there come a time that there was a
[57:41] prophet came into the land by the name
[57:43] of Elijah who was anointed with the
[57:45] message of God and he performed the
[57:47] miraculous and proved that omnipotence
[57:49] still was miraculous the prophet stood
[57:52] out there and closed the heavens that
[57:54] didn't rain in the days of his ministry
[57:57] and he brought the Rains Down out of the
[57:59] heavens and give the Earth and Angels
[58:01] appeared on the scene Hallelujah baked
[58:03] him some cornbread and they kept him 40
[58:05] days alive while he was out there in the
[58:08] wilderness so what you know when he
[58:10] called and but God wanted to show them
[58:14] what was going to take place then he was
[58:16] he was showing what was going to take
[58:19] place he was showing he had somebody
[58:22] that was had went through these things
[58:24] it just wasn't him talking about he knew
[58:25] what he had seen the
[58:27] supernatural he had went through the
[58:30] Supernatural and he was manifesting the
[58:33] supernatural but to those that believe
[58:35] they saw
[58:37] that just in our day see a lot of people
[58:41] they don't they don't believe
[58:43] that but you know what but those that
[58:46] have go God has showed Mercy to than
[58:50] Lord to come to open our eyes we've seen
[58:52] the supernatural we've seen the
[58:55] miraculous we've seen the omnipotence of
[58:58] God we've seen these things take
[59:00] place whether whether nobody else
[59:02] believes it or not we've seen it take
[59:04] place we know what's
[59:06] truth we we've we've experienced
[59:10] this and so when you see all these
[59:13] things that that came
[59:16] down he you know he told all of them now
[59:19] I've I've witnessed these things and God
[59:21] has told me what's going to take place
[59:24] and he called all the people up there to
[59:25] Mount Carmel and he had all those
[59:27] prophets and he told those prophets he
[59:29] said now we're going to we're going to
[59:30] see who answers whether God will answer
[59:33] by fire or will baale answer by fire why
[59:37] because but you know he he said listen
[59:39] I've had this Supernatural and I know
[59:40] what God's told me and I tell you what's
[59:42] going to take
[59:44] place we're going to build the altars
[59:46] we're going to have the oxen we're going
[59:47] to have everything set in order and he
[59:49] said then we're going to see who answers
[59:51] by fire we're going to have everything
[59:53] set in order like it's supposed to be
[59:55] where we're going to see who
[59:57] answers and they said you know the
[59:59] prophets of baale spent all their time
[1:00:01] out there cutting themselves and praying
[1:00:03] and seeking seeking bail to come and
[1:00:05] answer and you know Elijah was sitting
[1:00:07] over just resting and relaxing and
[1:00:09] saying well maybe he went
[1:00:11] fishing maybe he's out somewhere but
[1:00:13] just y'all need to yell a little bit
[1:00:18] louder it's like is this all you
[1:00:21] got right they're out there cutting
[1:00:24] themselves and everything like that
[1:00:27] going into a
[1:00:30] frenzy and you know like well let me
[1:00:34] when y'all get done I'll start
[1:00:38] mine but he just kept going on and on
[1:00:41] and on all
[1:00:44] day all day they were out
[1:00:47] there and nothing ever
[1:00:51] happened but the scripture says here and
[1:00:54] in First Kings and it says and it came
[1:00:56] to pass at the time of the offering of
[1:00:59] the evening
[1:01:01] sacrifice when the evening time came why
[1:01:04] because Elijah had the word of the Lord
[1:01:08] and he knew when when when to do these
[1:01:10] things he had set everything in order
[1:01:13] and he knew when God wanted it done he
[1:01:16] said that Elijah the prophet came there
[1:01:18] and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and
[1:01:21] of Israel let it be known this day that
[1:01:24] thou art God in Israel and that I am thy
[1:01:27] servant and that I have done all these
[1:01:29] things at Thy word hear me oh Lord hear
[1:01:32] me that this people may know that thou
[1:01:35] art the Lord God that thou H has turned
[1:01:38] their heart back again
[1:01:41] am he was going to show them what they
[1:01:45] who he was and that he's turning them
[1:01:49] back because that was the word that was
[1:01:51] given to
[1:01:52] Elijah just like an our day there was a
[1:01:56] word that was given in our day to turn
[1:01:58] our hearts
[1:01:59] back he said then the fire of the Lord
[1:02:02] fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice
[1:02:04] and the wood and the stones and the dust
[1:02:06] and licked up all the water that was in
[1:02:07] the
[1:02:08] trench and when all the people saw it
[1:02:11] they fell on their faces and they said
[1:02:14] the Lord he is the god the Lord he is
[1:02:18] the god and Elijah said unto them take
[1:02:21] the prophets of Baal let not one one of
[1:02:24] them escaped and they took them and
[1:02:27] Elijah brought them down to the brook of
[1:02:29] kesan and slew them there and Elijah
[1:02:32] said unto Ahab Ahab get thee up eat and
[1:02:35] drink for there is a sound of abundance
[1:02:38] of rain and that's where we started our
[1:02:41] scripture this this afternoon reading
[1:02:43] from when did they hear the sound of a
[1:02:46] when when did when did the prophet hear
[1:02:47] the sound of abundance of rain when the
[1:02:50] Judgment had fallen and it had the
[1:02:53] Judgment had been f fied why because all
[1:02:55] of those prophets were taken down there
[1:02:57] and destroyed and killed when all that
[1:02:59] had taken place and because of what had
[1:03:01] taken place because of the battle that
[1:03:03] took place when when it when The
[1:03:05] Showdown took place and the people and
[1:03:07] they turned their hearts back because
[1:03:09] what they had saw and they said he is
[1:03:11] the Lord he is the god he is God he
[1:03:14] answered he answered by fire the
[1:03:17] Elijah's God is correct he's calling us
[1:03:21] back we've been under judgment this
[1:03:23] whole time but bringing us back he wants
[1:03:26] us to come
[1:03:28] back and when they turn their hearts
[1:03:30] back to fall on the ground to worship
[1:03:31] God and and we're coming back lord we've
[1:03:35] been away but we want to come back and
[1:03:37] when they when they step forward to do
[1:03:39] that then all of a sudden then Elijah
[1:03:41] says listen I hear the sound of
[1:03:43] abundance of rain I hear I hear a
[1:03:45] rainstorm
[1:03:47] coming I I why because judgment is
[1:03:50] passed
[1:03:53] amen see now we're stepping into
[1:03:57] this see when God has called us to
[1:04:00] this God has called the the The
[1:04:03] Messengers and this is from the evening
[1:04:05] message brother R said therefore when
[1:04:07] God sent forth His prophets his
[1:04:09] messengers of The Testament he spoke to
[1:04:11] one man and that man had to bring the
[1:04:13] message others went from him everywhere
[1:04:16] bringing the same message he said but
[1:04:19] there had to be one headquarters God has
[1:04:21] always had it he said I'm thankful has
[1:04:24] got it tonight that's the Holy Ghost of
[1:04:27] course see we all know now not some
[1:04:30] group but the holy spirit is God's
[1:04:32] headquarters that's God's messenger of
[1:04:34] the hour amen now what is it to the
[1:04:37] prophet that the word comes always come
[1:04:40] if they are true a true prophet of the
[1:04:43] of the word god vindicates his word by
[1:04:46] that Prophet now there's there's been
[1:04:49] many false prophets and we've had them
[1:04:52] all Through the Ages we go back to the
[1:04:53] old Old Testament and we see them rise
[1:04:55] up and speak in the name of the Lord and
[1:04:57] it wasn't right God would have nothing
[1:05:00] to do with it he never vindicates
[1:05:02] nothing but his own word anyway he
[1:05:05] wouldn't run his business like
[1:05:08] that he has a he has a plan and he has a
[1:05:11] purpose and he brings it to pass he has
[1:05:13] a he has a will and it's his word and he
[1:05:15] brings it to
[1:05:17] pass and he vindicates his own word he
[1:05:20] said Just remember God only vindicates
[1:05:23] his word and only a true Prophet the
[1:05:25] only way you can tell whether he's true
[1:05:28] or not is by the word that's the way to
[1:05:30] judge him whether the word comes to pass
[1:05:33] or not because if it's showing exactly
[1:05:36] what those scripture says and that's
[1:05:38] exactly what it done was when they came
[1:05:40] out there the god came and Vindicated
[1:05:43] exactly what he told
[1:05:44] them and it's the same way it is in our
[1:05:47] day we've received a message and because
[1:05:51] you know what as as as you begin to not
[1:05:53] not look through do some denominational
[1:05:55] ideas or read some denominational book
[1:05:57] but if you sit down with an open heart
[1:05:59] and and and seek God and you begin to
[1:06:01] read the scripture then all of a sudden
[1:06:03] you begin to understand that this
[1:06:05] message is the word of God it's not some
[1:06:08] part of it but it is the word of God and
[1:06:10] you know what there's not there's not
[1:06:11] some you know 60% or 70% or this or that
[1:06:15] or some you know brother Brandon was
[1:06:16] confused no brother Brandon wasn't
[1:06:18] confused he was the mouthpiece of God
[1:06:20] whether he was so he was either 100%
[1:06:22] right or we need to get R of all of it
[1:06:25] because it either has to be all right or
[1:06:26] all
[1:06:28] wrong and we we've got to have it just
[1:06:31] like that we've got to lay our put our
[1:06:33] whole confidence in it we've got to put
[1:06:35] our stake our whole lives on it that
[1:06:37] it's actually the truth or it's
[1:06:39] not you've got to believe that it's the
[1:06:41] truth it's thus sayith the Lord or it's
[1:06:46] not the more you put your trust and
[1:06:48] confidence in God the more you come to
[1:06:50] see that it's the truth it becomes real
[1:06:52] it becomes manifest
[1:06:55] this is from the this is from the
[1:06:57] message look brother says he says what
[1:06:59] are what are you looking at this morning
[1:07:02] he said what are you looking at did you
[1:07:04] stop in this hideous hectic day that
[1:07:07] we're that we're living in he said what
[1:07:09] are you looking for God has placed
[1:07:11] everything the troubling of the waters
[1:07:15] that that first little move people
[1:07:16] jumped in the sign of in the hand in the
[1:07:19] sky Elijah said that cloud the size of a
[1:07:22] man's hand like a vape
[1:07:25] what is it he kept believing I hear the
[1:07:27] sound of abundance of rain that cloud
[1:07:30] became two clouds two clouds became a
[1:07:33] hill and a a hill became a mountain the
[1:07:36] mountain became Another Mountain the
[1:07:38] first thing you know the whole Skies was
[1:07:40] thundering and rainfalling what was it
[1:07:42] he accepted what God sent and this
[1:07:45] morning if if that little thing has
[1:07:47] touched your heart and it says I need
[1:07:50] that that's little sign the sign of a of
[1:07:54] a hand of a man
[1:07:56] come so if you SE just like he said he
[1:07:59] he saw that
[1:08:02] little he heard that
[1:08:04] sound of abundance of
[1:08:08] rain and everybody's
[1:08:13] like what's he looking
[1:08:16] at I don't see
[1:08:20] nothing and when he sent his servant up
[1:08:22] there on the mount he said go look
[1:08:24] go look I see nothing go look I don't
[1:08:28] see anything go
[1:08:31] look when he went seven times the only
[1:08:33] thing he saw in the distance was a cloud
[1:08:35] the size of a man's
[1:08:40] hand and that and that was the
[1:08:43] confirmation of the
[1:08:46] rain that he had heard and he saw that
[1:08:48] that was the
[1:08:49] confirmation and Elijah's up there
[1:08:51] telling Ahab you better get in your
[1:08:53] chair you better get back to jezel cuz
[1:08:55] you know what you're not going to
[1:08:56] survive this
[1:09:00] storm said you better go you better get
[1:09:03] you better get
[1:09:04] prepared cuz here it
[1:09:06] comes here comes all this the The rain
[1:09:09] that's coming and all of
[1:09:12] this and they they that that just that
[1:09:15] little cloud of a man's hand that that's
[1:09:18] all you see that's all the evidence but
[1:09:20] that's all the evidence that you
[1:09:22] need the scripture tells us that that
[1:09:25] all of a sudden and the Scripture it
[1:09:27] tells us that when you saw later on they
[1:09:29] saw it and all of a sudden the skies
[1:09:31] were so black and all of a sudden the
[1:09:32] rain began to
[1:09:35] fall all of a sudden it started with
[1:09:37] what just one little just one little
[1:09:41] Cloud brother B says and that's the way
[1:09:44] about people who want to get healed he
[1:09:46] said if if they can just have one little
[1:09:48] visible evidence like e like Elijah when
[1:09:51] he said Gesa said I see a cloud about
[1:09:54] the size of a man's hand Elijah said I
[1:09:56] hear the sound of abundance of rain he
[1:09:59] saw the evidence that's why many times I
[1:10:02] tell the people go on start praising the
[1:10:04] Lord see because that is the adopted
[1:10:08] baby because that it's in their
[1:10:11] intellectual until it comes into their
[1:10:13] soul that they're healed then Faith
[1:10:15] makes it right he said you've got to
[1:10:18] know what you're doing you've got to
[1:10:20] have confidence in what you're doing so
[1:10:23] if you would just take him at his word
[1:10:25] whether you see the evidence or not but
[1:10:27] if you but if you have confidence and
[1:10:28] believe that God spoke to you whether
[1:10:30] you whether you see any evidence or not
[1:10:32] but if you take God at his word then he
[1:10:34] said just continue to praise God for it
[1:10:36] because it's going to come to pass all
[1:10:38] you got to do is believe
[1:10:40] it so you just keep holding on because
[1:10:43] it's going to take
[1:10:50] place see brother B say I'm going finish
[1:10:53] fin with this but you we see we see all
[1:10:56] these things that are taking place if if
[1:10:58] you have a need you just trust God
[1:11:00] because if God's ever done it one time
[1:11:02] in your life if he's ever healed you one
[1:11:04] time if he's ever healed anybody of it
[1:11:06] one time then you know what he'll do it
[1:11:08] again you don't have you don't have to
[1:11:10] whether you know worry or or fret over
[1:11:13] whether God's going to do it or not
[1:11:15] because like I like I preached before
[1:11:16] you know if you take God at his word
[1:11:18] it's it's just like having a court trial
[1:11:20] you go before God you don't have to
[1:11:22] plead and beg you got to know is what
[1:11:24] the word says and apply the word to your
[1:11:27] situation when you go to court you know
[1:11:30] you take the law and say this is the
[1:11:32] situation and this is what the law says
[1:11:34] and as long as you meet what the law
[1:11:36] requires then you know what you've got
[1:11:38] to have the Judgment go your
[1:11:40] favor and that's all you got to have you
[1:11:43] ain't got to get in there and try to
[1:11:44] plead and beg and tell a sob story to
[1:11:46] the judge the judge don't care about
[1:11:48] none of that judge the judge wants to
[1:11:50] know what the evidence is and what the
[1:11:52] law says and and if you have somebody
[1:11:54] and let me tell you see we've got the
[1:11:56] judge and the jury and the lawyer all on
[1:11:59] our side why because he's the Lord Jesus
[1:12:01] Christ and so he's got it and he comes
[1:12:03] in court and all you got to do is
[1:12:05] believe
[1:12:08] him just trust in what he says that's
[1:12:11] right then you can receive exactly what
[1:12:13] you have need
[1:12:18] of I'm we'll finish with this this is
[1:12:21] have the musicians come
[1:12:26] he says he said and we look down he said
[1:12:29] at this blessed old word and it and it
[1:12:31] said these days would be here and here
[1:12:34] we stand we see the IM omnipotent god
[1:12:37] with his arm outstretched and signs and
[1:12:39] wonders are coming we hear the sound of
[1:12:42] abundance of rain in the air we know
[1:12:44] that we're in the great day of the last
[1:12:46] rain when Satan will be bound and cast
[1:12:49] into the pit chained with a chain of
[1:12:51] circumstance that he cannot come out am
[1:12:54] and deceive the Nations no more and a
[1:12:57] thousand years Millennial reign will
[1:12:58] take place on the earth while we're
[1:13:00] glorifying our lord Jesus and adoring
[1:13:03] him crowning him Kings and kings and
[1:13:05] Lord of lords he said and this old
[1:13:08] sinful Earth will bust open some of
[1:13:10] these days when the atomic powers are
[1:13:13] loose and the hydrogens will in every
[1:13:16] Sea and the water and the Sea will weep
[1:13:20] till it's dry oh God and the sun will
[1:13:23] fail to shine and the moon won't give
[1:13:25] its light and the stars of heaven will
[1:13:26] fall like an untimely fig tree when
[1:13:29] she's shaken of A Mighty Wind and men
[1:13:31] will cry for the rocks and the mountains
[1:13:33] and what This Little Light would amount
[1:13:35] to then then the dead in Christ shall
[1:13:38] rise oh what a paradise Nation shall not
[1:13:41] lift up sword against Nation anymore
[1:13:44] neither will there have to be a prayer
[1:13:46] line for the sick today is the day of
[1:13:50] salvation what a great day that we're
[1:13:52] looking forward to because one of these
[1:13:53] days all of these things are going to be
[1:13:55] over
[1:13:56] with we see we see that judgment's at
[1:13:59] hand but praise God we have a way of
[1:14:01] Escape God has made God has given us the
[1:14:05] provision God has given us everything
[1:14:07] that we have need of let's all stand
[1:14:09] this evening and if you have a need them
[1:14:11] then you claim what belongs to you
[1:14:19] sir you
[1:14:22] know
[1:14:25] you know a man a man is just as good as
[1:14:27] his
[1:14:29] word but you know what a a man that
[1:14:33] gives you his word you know you're just
[1:14:36] you're only as good as you beli
[1:14:42] that because if somebody stood there and
[1:14:45] says well I'm I'm gonna give you what
[1:14:46] you have need of whatever whatever you
[1:14:49] know you give you money or whatever
[1:14:52] whatever it is
[1:14:54] and you know you can stand there and
[1:14:56] hold it here you
[1:14:57] go if you ain't got faith to walk up and
[1:15:00] claim
[1:15:02] it what is it that that you don't
[1:15:05] believe that that he would give that to
[1:15:12] you and many times we
[1:15:14] we we hinder God because of our
[1:15:18] unbelief sure because God's trying to
[1:15:21] bless us and we I don't I don't know I
[1:15:23] don't
[1:15:28] and sometimes God wants to see how long
[1:15:29] you how long you going to stand
[1:15:34] there are you are you willing are you
[1:15:36] willing to
[1:15:41] wait God told God told
[1:15:45] Abraham that that he was blessed that he
[1:15:48] was going to have a
[1:15:50] son everything everything that that
[1:15:53] belong he said everywhere you put your
[1:15:54] foot and everywhere you look all this
[1:15:57] Belongs to You Abraham you see this and
[1:15:59] it'll belong to your seed
[1:16:03] right and can you count can you count
[1:16:06] the Stars can you count the sands on the
[1:16:11] beach that's the number of of your
[1:16:15] seed an old man that
[1:16:19] was one foot in the grave one on the
[1:16:21] banana
[1:16:22] peel
[1:16:24] and he's going he's going to tell you
[1:16:25] I'm gonna have
[1:16:26] children you need a
[1:16:30] psychiatrist
[1:16:32] right need put you in the rubber room
[1:16:36] somewhere but you know what that didn't
[1:16:37] change
[1:16:39] Abraham I didn't change Abraham's
[1:16:44] faith and you know what even even when
[1:16:46] Abraham fail and lied you know what he
[1:16:50] didn't change Pro the promise of God in
[1:16:52] his life and you know what he picked
[1:16:53] himself up and kept
[1:16:57] going and what brother brandham say the
[1:17:00] Seed of Abraham he said every the
[1:17:04] bride he said would take the same
[1:17:07] Journey he said every son of the faith
[1:17:09] takes the same
[1:17:13] Journey so if you fall guess what
[1:17:15] Abraham did
[1:17:17] too but God kept his hand on Abraham and
[1:17:20] the promise didn't change to Abraham and
[1:17:22] he was more than a conqueror am he
[1:17:24] received he received the promised son
[1:17:27] did it didn't it didn't stop when when
[1:17:30] he failed and you know he got all
[1:17:32] confused and decided he was going to
[1:17:34] follow his wife's
[1:17:36] Doctrine he didn't change the plan of
[1:17:40] God it might have made it little hard on
[1:17:43] him but it didn't change the promise of
[1:17:45] God no right cuz God had had it one way
[1:17:50] of what was going to take place amen
[1:17:52] right he had one
[1:17:55] son now he had other
[1:17:57] children but he had one promised son
[1:18:00] that was Isaac Isaac was going to be the
[1:18:02] one amen that was going to bring forth
[1:18:05] that was going to fulfill what he told
[1:18:10] Abraham and you and I are the same way
[1:18:12] God has called you nobody else can take
[1:18:15] your
[1:18:17] place because if God spoke to you then
[1:18:19] you know what you're the one that's
[1:18:20] going to
[1:18:21] overcome you know what we're no match
[1:18:25] for the devil but you know what with us
[1:18:28] in the word and him in us the the
[1:18:31] Satan's no match for us he's no match
[1:18:33] for the
[1:18:35] word and that's what God has given us
