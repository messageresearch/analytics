[11:06] amen
[11:07] but we're just glad to be able it's a
[11:10] hard time
[11:12] and all that we know but yet still
[11:15] it is a time that we can take the time
[11:17] and we can this
[11:18] do this that they would have been months
[11:22] maybe years before they could ever got

[12:36] because that way you can dedicate then
[12:38] see you dedicating yourself

[20:06] love brother dale and you know what
[20:09] we're going to talk a little bit about
[20:11] that like as we did last
[20:12] wednesday about perfect love
[20:16] so we'll start with the this will be the
[20:18] plan part 15
[20:19] today we're going to look at the chart a
[20:22] little bit to show us where we're at
[20:24] and i'll be giving those out but brother
[20:26] joe will be putting it up on the
[20:28] on the screen so we're going hebrews 9
[20:30] 11 9 verse 11.
[20:33] let's bow our heads before we get
[20:34] started dear heavenly father thank you
[20:37] for this day that we're living in
[20:38] the hour that you give us to be here
[20:40] lord we pray now that you would
[20:42] be the active participant in this
[20:43] service lord you do the speaking
[20:46] you're the only one who can do the
[20:47] revealing father because without you
[20:49] here lord it's just a meeting
[20:51] lord as the prophet said that
[20:53] denominationals have just come to where
[20:54] it's a meeting of a lodge lord we don't
[20:56] want a lodge meeting today
[20:58] we want a meeting with the power of the
[21:00] holy ghost being in each our
[21:02] of our lives and if someone is not
[21:04] empowered with the holy ghost we pray
[21:06] that today during this
[21:07] service that you'll drop down as in the
[21:10] book of acts while the word was being
[21:11] preached the holy ghost fell on the
[21:12] people
[21:13] we pray that you would heal the sick
[21:16] lord sanctify us for this journey that
[21:17] we're on it's been a long journey lord
[21:19] but i believe it's coming to an end
[21:21] and father i pray that you would be with
[21:23] each one lord it's not here be the ones
[21:25] that are sick brother danny sister joyce
[21:27] sister hope the different ones lord
[21:29] fighting the covet
[21:30] we pray that you'd be with them lord all
[21:32] the older ones that are not here today
[21:34] too we pray that you'd be with them
[21:36] just touch each one of us lead us and
[21:38] guide us by your holy spirit
[21:40] bless this day lord in jesus name amen
[21:43] hebrews 11
[21:44] 9 11 but christ being coming high priest
[21:47] of good things to come by a greater and
[21:49] more perfect tabernacle
[21:51] not made with hands that is to say not
[21:53] of this building
[21:55] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[21:57] but by his own blood he entered
[21:58] in once into the holy place and here's
[22:01] our thought that we've been known for
[22:03] now 15 sermons
[22:04] having obtained eternal redemption for
[22:07] us you may be seated in the lord as
[22:09] blessing
[22:10] he has obtained eternal redemption
[22:13] because remember
[22:14] in this plan of redemption jesus christ
[22:17] was almighty god but he was living in a
[22:19] body that was not
[22:20] eternal he was living in a body that was
[22:23] brought here by god but once it came
[22:25] into this dimension
[22:26] it had to be our brother he had to be
[22:28] able that flesh had to be able to die
[22:30] for our sins
[22:32] because we couldn't have a spirit die
[22:34] for us because spirits don't die
[22:37] amen spirits don't die so we had to have
[22:40] a man
[22:40] but that plan started before the
[22:43] foundation of the world and we've been
[22:44] talking about it and we'll read it in
[22:45] just a minute in ephesians again
[22:47] but let's go to first john 4 verse 16
[22:49] because we're heading toward this
[22:51] part of perfect love and uh
[22:54] i hope you enjoyed wednesday night i
[22:56] enjoyed and sometimes you enjoy
[22:57] preaching things and sometimes you don't
[22:58] and i know ministers know that
[23:00] but i enjoyed wednesday night myself and
[23:02] i know a lot of you did because
[23:04] you get good comments from it you know
[23:06] you give the handclap to the lord
[23:07] because
[23:08] he's the one that gave it to you amen
[23:11] but watch this and we have known and
[23:13] believed the love of god that
[23:15] one more time believe the love that god
[23:18] hath to us now remember
[23:19] there is no lesser form of
[23:22] love in god except agape love
[23:26] right everybody got that there is no
[23:28] less reform god does not have
[23:30] filial love because filio love
[23:34] he'd be wishy-washy and agape love is
[23:37] you say oh
[23:38] see we have we have traded agape love
[23:41] with greasy grace
[23:44] and you can get by whatever you want to
[23:45] because god's a good god
[23:48] you got to remember one thing god is a
[23:51] judge
[23:53] he is a righteous judge he does not do
[23:56] things
[23:57] frivolously he does not make decisions
[23:59] that are wrong
[24:00] so to be a righteous judge though this
[24:03] love that he has for us this agape love
[24:05] is not what you're feeling towards your
[24:08] wife and towards your family and even
[24:09] towards your pastor
[24:12] that's feel your love agape love the
[24:15] only way you can
[24:16] really experience agape love is to be
[24:19] born again
[24:20] no other way you can't understand it
[24:22] because that's what's happening now
[24:24] is the world as bob and i were talking a
[24:26] few minutes ago the world has traded all
[24:28] that though
[24:30] for do you know if you're if you don't
[24:31] have the baptism of the holy ghost in
[24:33] your soul
[24:34] if you don't have the new birth today
[24:36] you do not have agape love
[24:38] you're just living under filial love so
[24:40] the denominational world anybody that's
[24:43] not born again
[24:44] anybody that's even a foolish virgin has
[24:46] not experienced
[24:48] and never will experience agape love
[24:51] only the bride brother brown talked
[24:54] about the
[24:54] quote and i didn't bring it before
[24:56] brother brown says only the bride will
[24:57] have what
[24:58] true faith true true faith which makes
[25:02] perfect faith makes perfect love so the
[25:04] bride will only be the only ones that
[25:05] know
[25:06] and you say well how how do you know
[25:08] that well even the bible tells us the
[25:10] saints will judge the earth now listen
[25:12] you're going to judge the earth by
[25:13] perfect love that you have
[25:16] you're not going listen by filial love
[25:18] if you walk to the white throne judgment
[25:19] with filial love
[25:22] everybody will get in right
[25:25] nobody's going to see you see how the
[25:27] devils took that though and nobody's
[25:28] going to hell anymore they can just do
[25:29] away with it because
[25:31] nobody's going to hell everybody's going
[25:32] to heaven because they're all good
[25:33] people
[25:34] yeah hell's going to be full of good
[25:36] people
[25:41] i would say a lot of message believers
[25:42] but i'm not going to go there
[25:44] and we have known and believed the love
[25:46] that god hath to us look
[25:48] god is love and he that dwelleth in love
[25:51] now look dwelleth not just
[25:53] know about it every once in a while not
[25:55] just to think about it every once in a
[25:57] while but if you dwell in love
[26:00] you dwelleth in god and god in you or
[26:03] him
[26:03] talk about me us you herein is our love
[26:07] made perfect
[26:08] that we may have boldness in the day of
[26:10] what see that word
[26:12] judgment you have to bring judgment into
[26:14] agape love
[26:16] amen you see there in the boldness and
[26:19] the day of judgment because there's only
[26:21] way you can be a judge
[26:23] is to have agape love right
[26:26] because as he is so are we in this world
[26:30] there is no fear in love but perfect
[26:33] love casteth out fear because
[26:36] fear hath torment now we've been going
[26:39] through this whole world about a year's
[26:41] worth of just
[26:42] people being scared of their shadow
[26:44] people being scared to come to church
[26:46] scared to even breathe
[26:48] when are we going to get out of that he
[26:51] that feareth is not
[26:52] made perfect let me read that one more
[26:56] time
[26:58] he that feareth is not made perfect
[27:01] in love i'm just reading bible and
[27:03] that's not my quote that's not brother
[27:05] brown's quote that's the bible
[27:06] all right that's the bible we love him
[27:09] because he first
[27:10] what predestinated by foreknowledge that
[27:13] we would love him he loved us first
[27:16] that's what we've been talking about
[27:17] that before the foundation of the world
[27:19] god by foreknowledge knew who would and
[27:21] who wouldn't love him so
[27:22] he made a place and a way for
[27:25] us to get to this direction for the ones
[27:27] that don't love him to get to this
[27:29] direction and i'll read you a scripture
[27:30] here in a few minutes
[27:31] where jesus says depart from me i never
[27:34] knew you
[27:36] oh have i not cast out devils have i not
[27:38] preached this message have i not
[27:39] oh i've done all these i i i me me
[27:46] he said depart from me i never knew you
[27:49] and that word new is not just k-n-e-w
[27:51] like i knew this brother right here
[27:53] no we'll get to that in a minute there's
[27:55] no fear and love but
[27:56] perfect love castes out fear because
[27:59] fear hath torment
[28:01] he that feareth is not made perfect in
[28:03] love we love him because he first love
[28:06] us
[28:06] so you see he had to project his love
[28:08] first
[28:10] because all we knew all we know down
[28:12] here is filial love
[28:15] that's all we know is feel your love as
[28:17] a human being everybody got that because
[28:19] i remember i read you that quote until
[28:20] the sunday
[28:21] i mean wednesday night read it real
[28:23] quick and then we'll get back to it
[28:26] brother brown says
[28:32] what is that
[28:37] well i'll get to it in a minute but
[28:38] remember he says you don't love
[28:41] you can't have agape love with your
[28:42] natural body your natural body has
[28:44] filial love
[28:45] your spirit realm is where you love
[28:47] memory reason
[28:49] conscious affection imagination that
[28:52] affection in that second realm
[28:54] is not godly perfection i mean
[28:58] whatever you want to call it love right
[29:00] or affection
[29:03] inside the soul then though
[29:06] is dot is not filial love
[29:10] it's either agape love or it's lust
[29:14] unbelief inside your soul you say oh i
[29:17] don't lust after that hang on a minute
[29:19] i'm telling you these people that preach
[29:21] the gospel
[29:22] heal the sick cast out devils raise the
[29:24] dead and they're going to hell because
[29:26] they didn't get perfect love in their
[29:28] soul
[29:28] they got it on their spirit realm so
[29:30] much until
[29:33] they thought that was the holy ghost
[29:34] that's why that we contend in this
[29:36] church and
[29:37] and as many as i know the fellowships
[29:40] with us
[29:40] we believe in getting born again amen we
[29:43] believe in a life-changing experience
[29:46] we believe that the things i used to do
[29:50] i do them no more amen
[29:53] why you've been made perfect in love
[29:56] now sure you're gonna have a fight
[29:58] outside you're gonna have a fight in
[29:59] that sec in that second realm
[30:01] i didn't say it was all pieces and cream
[30:04] no that's where you're gonna have your
[30:05] fight but listen if you're born again
[30:07] today your soul has no fight
[30:10] it has already been victorious
[30:14] and it's not it's not it's not the
[30:17] it's not the love of god yet it is but
[30:20] it
[30:20] is god it's not i love my
[30:24] no it is god if god is love
[30:28] read it right there god is love
[30:31] and that love where's god at today if
[30:33] you're born again
[30:35] he's not a second or third person of a
[30:37] trinity he's only one person
[30:40] and he is by the baptism of the holy
[30:42] ghost he has him morphine himself into
[30:44] you
[30:45] to give you that perfect love and that's
[30:48] where the fear should be cast out
[30:50] let me read you a quote now they don't
[30:51] have this one but i'll watch this right
[30:53] here
[30:54] you don't have to look for it and here
[30:56] you hear him though in 1956
[30:58] brother brown said see salvation is not
[31:00] based upon what someone else thinks
[31:02] it's what you think of him divine
[31:05] healing isn't based on what the critics
[31:07] say
[31:08] or what the church says it's based on
[31:10] your perfect faith
[31:12] he didn't stop your perfect faith in the
[31:15] inspired
[31:16] word of god so you've got to hear an
[31:18] inspired word of god to even have faith
[31:21] as brother they'll talk about this
[31:22] morning
[31:23] we need apostles prophets pastors
[31:25] teachers and evangelists because
[31:27] god saw that that's what we need god saw
[31:29] that that's what we needed an inspired
[31:31] word of god
[31:32] coming from a fivefold ministry and i
[31:35] know we all believe that
[31:37] and then brother brown says look it's
[31:39] based on your perfect faith in the
[31:41] inspired word of god
[31:42] and how you're inspired to believe it
[31:45] that's what
[31:46] brings the results is your inspiration
[31:49] by the word so what are you based on
[31:52] feeling emotion gifts no you're based on
[31:55] the word
[31:56] then it brings all those things it's
[31:58] like we were talking about
[31:59] this about wednesday night you know i
[32:02] think the problem with that we've still
[32:03] been here is
[32:05] is because of one thing we have majored
[32:08] brother brown said on a miner
[32:13] we've majored on a minor if you want to
[32:14] to help you understand that
[32:16] like i was saying before if you want to
[32:17] be a doctor if zach's going to become a
[32:19] doctor
[32:21] just for those of you that weren't here
[32:22] and those of you that were asleep
[32:23] wednesday night at least you'll wait for
[32:24] a little while right now
[32:26] praise the lord so anyway so you're
[32:28] going to be a doctor
[32:31] all right now what courses you're going
[32:32] to have to take well i need to take
[32:34] woodworking i need to take electricity
[32:37] i need to learn how to crayon in between
[32:39] my lines
[32:40] i need to learn sports uh
[32:43] now that's part of the curriculum but
[32:46] that's not gonna make him a doctor
[32:49] he can do some of these elective courses
[32:51] that's fine
[32:52] but his core courses are gonna be
[32:54] biology chemistry
[32:56] anatomy of the body how to cut somebody
[32:58] open how to sew somebody up
[33:00] that's the same way in the message of
[33:02] the hour we majored on all these
[33:04] minor
[33:09] that's it folks that's why we've been
[33:11] here 50 or 60 years we've majored on the
[33:13] electives and not majored on what the
[33:17] prophet told us
[33:18] he said it would take those seven
[33:20] unknown thunders it would take the seals
[33:22] to be open
[33:24] for us to even understand anything the
[33:27] real message of the hour
[33:30] now listen when i say the real message
[33:32] of the hour there's not that's not
[33:33] saying that the rest of it's false
[33:36] but you have to build now listen those
[33:38] electives have to be there
[33:40] and they will help that person but it
[33:41] will never get zach the degree
[33:44] now what is my degree in your degree a
[33:46] body change
[33:47] our degree is not by and by i'll see you
[33:50] because i got to die
[33:53] ours is standing on earth and
[33:57] literally death the prophet said would
[33:59] crawl up your sleeve and you would say
[34:01] no reverse the process you will say no
[34:06] way
[34:06] that's not going to happen to me so but
[34:09] then
[34:10] you you say well now all right zach you
[34:13] want to be a doctor
[34:13] i don't care if you do or not just say
[34:15] yes you want to be a doctor
[34:17] now i got this hurting right here in my
[34:19] back you want to come in here and cut me
[34:20] open and
[34:22] now he's going to be a doctor why can't
[34:24] he do that
[34:26] he's going to have the experience he's
[34:28] got to have some experience behind his
[34:30] belt that's what we've been having for
[34:32] 50 years
[34:33] we've been having but listen they put
[34:35] all their experience on this over here
[34:37] yeah and there was a time when we needed
[34:40] that we needed that like brother they
[34:42] were talking about the hair and the
[34:43] dress and living right and
[34:44] but you know what if you're born again
[34:49] if you're born again of the spirit of
[34:51] god
[34:54] a preacher should never have to tell you
[34:56] how to dress
[34:59] they got it all wrong yeah i'll clap
[35:01] myself
[35:03] they got it all wrong they're over here
[35:04] beating you up trying to get you to line
[35:06] up
[35:11] when if you got them born again by the
[35:14] prophet of god
[35:16] tells me that a holy ghost-filled woman
[35:18] will never put on
[35:19] never put on a pair of pants holy
[35:21] ghost-filled woman never cut her hair
[35:23] the bible tells you
[35:24] that it's an abomination for you to cut
[35:26] your hair so why do i have to keep
[35:28] rehashing all that
[35:30] read your bible but if you get born
[35:33] again something inside of you then your
[35:35] spiritual rudder is going to take you
[35:38] away from that
[35:40] oh i don't know if i can get to church
[35:41] or not i don't know
[35:45] didn't brother brown say christians went
[35:46] to church
[35:53] but filio love says well my cat's sick
[35:59] i'm gonna say that one more time my
[36:00] cat's sick filio love says i need to
[36:03] stay home with my kitty
[36:05] hmm or you know put whatever you want to
[36:09] in there you know i got to stay home
[36:10] because of
[36:11] because and i've seen people you know
[36:13] and i i'm going to tell you one more
[36:14] time
[36:16] we got people that you know my kids
[36:20] you know hannah was here a few minutes
[36:21] ago praise the lord at least maybe she
[36:23] got a little something y'all
[36:24] should have sprinkled something on top
[36:25] of her while she was here
[36:27] but i'm not going to compromise what i
[36:30] have
[36:32] and stay home because she's home i'm not
[36:35] going to have my kids come in and
[36:36] dictate what i do
[36:38] in my house as far as going to church
[36:40] june's dad
[36:41] he now it was probably the devil
[36:43] motivating him but a lot of times he'd
[36:45] show up on a saturday night or show up
[36:46] on a
[36:47] friday night you know and hang around
[36:49] for a little while and
[36:52] but you got to set an example i don't
[36:53] know why i'm going here but i'm going
[36:54] this way anyway
[36:55] but you got to set an example
[36:59] you got to say i'm going to church if
[37:00] you want to meet me
[37:02] you either go to church with me or you
[37:04] can sit right here and play with my dog
[37:06] until we get back toby will take care of
[37:10] that
[37:10] he'll take care of you and we'll come
[37:12] back but see they're
[37:14] they're waiting to see what you are
[37:15] going to do about it
[37:17] and a lot of times we fail should be
[37:22] church first beyond anything else
[37:24] should be your should be your like i
[37:25] tell you before
[37:27] i i know sister brewer and and and
[37:29] little sister brewer
[37:30] um they know the message so i'm not
[37:32] preaching to them but you know you get
[37:34] somebody walking in the door that's
[37:35] brand new
[37:37] and they come in and you know they
[37:38] haven't been around a message because
[37:40] what it shows
[37:41] their fruit show but brother dale's up
[37:44] here just hammering away and then all of
[37:45] a sudden he goes down that little
[37:47] pathway about water baptism or
[37:49] or god sent a prophet or or something
[37:51] like that and we just sat around like
[37:52] we're
[37:53] like stones on the river yeah right
[37:56] but you know what that's going to
[37:57] project to that person that person's
[37:59] going to say
[38:00] that i don't believe what he's saying
[38:01] and then people must not either
[38:05] no you should more try listen try your
[38:08] best
[38:09] to get out of nod for a little while
[38:12] and at least brother dale or somebody
[38:15] preaching up here and a new person walks
[38:17] in
[38:17] you ought to say that ain't nothing but
[38:18] the truth
[38:20] that's what we live on that's what we
[38:23] survive on we don't survive on a trinity
[38:25] we don't survive
[38:26] how in the world can we do that how can
[38:29] we survive on the trinity
[38:30] knowing what you know now how can you
[38:32] survive on uh
[38:34] you know what you got inside to use the
[38:35] third person of a trinity
[38:38] how can you do that you can't do that
[38:41] not if you're born again i'm telling you
[38:44] again one more time let that thing out
[38:46] you got people
[38:48] let it out and even if you're demon
[38:50] possessed let it out
[38:53] get get the holy ghost and then let him
[38:56] out let him work listen
[38:57] he ain't you'd say why not here you go
[38:59] giving away the holy ghost now you're
[39:01] never going to do that
[39:03] you're going to try to i try to give my
[39:05] eternal life to everybody i see that
[39:06] wants to listen
[39:08] amen because you're not going to be able
[39:09] to give it away
[39:11] if a man say i love god and hateth his
[39:14] brother he is a liar
[39:15] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[39:17] he has seen how can he love
[39:19] god whom he hath not seen
[39:22] that's pretty powerful
[39:26] that's why there's a lot of people have
[39:29] this projection
[39:30] of what god is and what he looks like
[39:33] and what his purpose is
[39:34] and it's false he's not the third person
[39:36] of the trinity
[39:39] he didn't create an eternal hell he
[39:41] didn't tell us to be baptized in the
[39:43] name of father son holy ghost you
[39:44] understand what i'm saying
[39:45] but now all the world is over here under
[39:47] this filial love
[39:48] because listen anything you hear that is
[39:52] contrary to the word of god
[39:54] is comes under filial love
[40:00] you can't preach a false doctrine and it
[40:02] be agape love
[40:05] so if you're preaching a false doctrine
[40:06] or you believe in a false doctrine
[40:08] you have not received that perfect love
[40:11] or that agape love because
[40:13] that is the love of god that isn't the
[40:16] love of god now the bible says projected
[40:18] but remember
[40:19] it's not projected like on a screen when
[40:21] god projects his love
[40:23] he takes his love and puts it inside of
[40:25] you and then that reacts to what he is
[40:30] that's why you sit here in a church
[40:32] service and you don't react
[40:33] maybe there's nothing to react with
[40:38] try it sometime try to react sometimes
[40:41] you've tried the other way long enough
[40:47] nobody's went out the door yet so we're
[40:48] good i said yet if i do and we'll get
[40:52] aaron to go stand he can p he can cover
[40:54] both doors
[40:58] god pulls a lot of weight in this
[41:00] message ephesians 1
[41:04] verse 4. he's the only one i can say
[41:06] that to
[41:07] and get by with it okay
[41:10] according as he has chosen us in him
[41:12] let's go to the underlying part
[41:14] before the foundation of the world
[41:16] that's what we've been talking about
[41:17] this whole plan of
[41:18] if it was an eternal plan of redemption
[41:21] it wasn't developed just
[41:24] well i got to do something no god before
[41:26] the foundation world this has all been
[41:28] settled
[41:29] he knew you were going to be here today
[41:31] and he knew
[41:32] that if you weren't going to be here and
[41:34] people look at me cross-eyed sometimes
[41:36] when they say i really enjoyed your
[41:37] sermon today
[41:38] and i said i really enjoyed you being
[41:40] here to enjoy my sermon today
[41:42] because there's a lot of people wanting
[41:44] here to enjoy right
[41:50] accordingly has chosen us in him before
[41:53] the foundation of the world that we
[41:54] should be holy
[41:55] and without blame before him in love
[41:57] then we talked about predestination unto
[41:59] the adoption of children now brother
[42:01] dale's been on adoption
[42:02] we're going to read a quote here on that
[42:04] i'm going to read from the adoption
[42:06] series
[42:07] so there must be a call that we were
[42:10] talking about something the other day
[42:11] and
[42:13] listen sure there's a call to be born
[42:15] again there's a call
[42:16] these different calls are going out but
[42:18] the call in this end time
[42:20] it narrows down the prophet to god says
[42:22] it's a narrow
[42:24] and that narrow way is adoption we're
[42:26] never going to come to the body change
[42:28] without someone
[42:31] somebody some not group individual
[42:34] coming to a place where death is
[42:36] destroyed in that person while they're
[42:39] still alive
[42:41] that's what our call is yeah it's our
[42:44] call to
[42:45] to preach on this and to preach on the
[42:47] holy ghost and preach on how to get it i
[42:49] believe we've been doing that
[42:51] but there comes a time where zach is
[42:53] going to be a
[42:54] a surgeon now he's going to take four
[42:58] years of college two years of extra

[43:38] the head teachers already come and give
[43:40] us what we need
[43:42] to get that certificate what are we

[44:38] see that goes back to why would i want i

[44:43] but this dude can't read
[44:45] what do you mean he can't read how did
[44:48] he become a surgeon well he just paid a
[44:49] couple hundred dollars and we showed him
[44:51] how to cut up a cat and we're
[44:52] he's ready to go
[44:56] well that's the way we've been if you're
[44:57] not born again if you've just been
[44:59] playing around with this message all
[45:00] this time and you're not went up the
[45:01] statue of perfect man
[45:02] and you're not showing any kind of any
[45:04] brotherly kindness or anything else
[45:06] that's exactly what you've done
[45:08] you've bought yourself a degree under
[45:10] filial love not agape love
[45:12] yeah because under agape love god
[45:15] will take you and teach you through
[45:18] apostles prophets pastors teachers
[45:20] evangelists and you sisters talking to
[45:21] your other sisters
[45:22] and each one talking to us each other
[45:25] about the word of god
[45:26] that puts us in line
[45:29] for this adoption because if you're born
[45:31] again you're all in line for adoption
[45:33] but it's not immediate everybody got
[45:36] that
[45:37] well there's already been listen you
[45:38] received the spirit of adoption
[45:41] inside that spirit that you get there is
[45:44] a way a prescription
[45:46] a curriculum that will get you there but
[45:48] now what does brother brown say he says
[45:50] now looking
[45:51] look if you grieve the holy ghost now
[45:53] you're not going to lose him
[45:55] that's right but he's going to go out on
[45:58] a limb now listen
[46:00] you're not going to do something wrong
[46:01] and god's going to go no i don't think
[46:03] i'm going no you know what he does
[46:04] he just lets you suffer a little bit
[46:07] he lets you go through some dry places
[46:09] every once in a while he lets you go
[46:11] god where are you
[46:15] you know what he's going to do he's a
[46:16] good god he's going to say you know what
[46:18] he said um you said a certain thing to
[46:21] this brother one time
[46:23] i'm talking about experience
[46:27] i said something about this certain
[46:28] brother one time and you need to get
[46:29] that took care of them
[46:31] now listen you can either get that took
[46:32] care of or you're gonna meet that on the
[46:34] other side
[46:36] and you're never gonna move past that
[46:37] spot right there
[46:40] that's why i called that brother up i
[46:42] said something about him and i call him
[46:43] up and apologize to him
[46:45] i was wrong yeah you know what that done
[46:49] like a revival phone call didn't cost a
[46:52] dime and it wasn't but about 15 minutes
[46:54] and after we got
[46:55] done he said well brother wait he said
[46:56] you've come up this way we go that way
[46:58] to illinois he said just
[46:59] call me and come preach preach for me
[47:01] any time
[47:03] see what i mean but that thing see it
[47:04] wasn't on him it was on me i'm the one
[47:06] that said it
[47:06] right so you be careful about belittling
[47:09] people and
[47:12] yakking about people and yeah be careful
[47:15] you'll never
[47:15] you'll never go past that point right
[47:18] trust me
[47:19] you'll walk around in dry places for a
[47:21] while
[47:23] why because the holy ghost says well
[47:25] you're still my child
[47:26] now listen i'm in adoption right you're
[47:28] still my child but what brother brown
[47:30] said he said oh
[47:32] but your child is acting up remember the
[47:34] holy ghost he's telling
[47:35] examples that the holy ghost goes to the
[47:37] father and says now
[47:39] not you but your child is acting a
[47:41] little
[47:42] acting up you know what he's going to do
[47:45] he's going to make you pay for it
[47:47] because brother dale says you know if
[47:49] bastard child can't take correction
[47:50] well the bastard child was born on the
[47:52] filial level bastard child is not born
[47:54] under gothic love
[47:56] agape love has nothing to do with sex
[47:58] desire has nothing to do with how we got
[47:59] here nothing to do with any of that
[48:01] that's what got us in trouble because we
[48:03] stepped over into filial love
[48:04] which rolls like a ball down to lust and
[48:07] all them other things
[48:08] we're going to read it in just a second
[48:10] but listen to this real quick
[48:13] get off that for a minute bro bob you
[48:14] don't talk to me tomorrow adoption
[48:20] series let's go
[48:21] well we've read this before we have
[48:24] redemption
[48:25] listen thank god for redemption
[48:28] listen thank god for grace and it's not
[48:30] greasy grace
[48:32] see greasy grace is a grandpa that lets
[48:34] you get by amen diana
[48:37] uh-huh she's shaking the head
[48:42] or if you only knew
[48:45] but in whom we have redemption through
[48:47] his blood what the forgiveness of sins
[48:50] according to the riches of his grace now
[48:51] what is grace given to us for grace is
[48:53] not given to us
[48:54] for stuff we're fiction to do right
[48:58] it's for your past amen
[49:01] because if you say it's for what's in
[49:03] front of me then you just go do to the
[49:05] go to the priest in the catholic church
[49:07] and say forgive me father for i'm going
[49:09] to i'm going to sin tomorrow i'm going
[49:10] to kill three people.
[49:12] that's why the mob loves to be catholic
[49:14] they're going to forgive and he'll just
[49:15] do the whatever he does and they're
[49:16] forgiven
[49:18] well you can't get forgiven for
[49:19] something you haven't done yet
[49:21] right that's not grace
[49:24] but listen what about a god though that
[49:27] will
[49:28] check you before you do it if you got
[49:30] agape love he's obligated to do that
[49:33] right he's obligated to put that little
[49:35] pen in your heart that says
[49:36] bear not go that way but now of course
[49:39] sometimes we do anyway
[49:41] so let's go to the next quote quote
[49:43] number one
[49:46] now he said this is from adoption
[49:49] because remember back in ephesians we
[49:52] saw where
[49:53] um i'm going to read it don't go back to
[49:55] it that we
[49:57] that what has having made known unto us
[49:59] the mystery of his will
[50:01] all right so this age and this end time
[50:03] is the only time
[50:05] that we know the full mystery of the
[50:07] will of god
[50:09] the full mystery of redemption not just
[50:11] as we're saved and we're sanctified and
[50:13] we're filled with the holy ghost
[50:14] and we're going to live a good life and
[50:16] we're going to pass away
[50:17] but we know where we're going and we'll
[50:19] be back and and all those things that's
[50:21] fine
[50:23] but i thought adoption had something to
[50:25] do with authority
[50:26] where you have authority over things all
[50:29] right so listen
[50:31] so now he made known unto us the mystery
[50:34] get the holy ghost
[50:35] on you sometime and start running that
[50:37] and just watch how it goes
[50:39] this afternoon i had all about 30
[50:41] minutes to study just to look the lesson
[50:42] over maybe not i'm not i'll say half of
[50:44] that 15 minutes
[50:46] and i got to run it and i thought the
[50:48] mystery how mysterious
[50:50] and the scripture packed me back into
[50:51] the old testament then back over into
[50:53] the new testament
[50:54] tied something together see the mystery
[50:56] of his coming the mystery of his will
[50:58] the mystery of
[50:59] us sitting together us
[51:02] not another age we've already seen all
[51:04] that's not a mystery anymore
[51:06] that mystery is history we know what
[51:10] martin luther came under we know what
[51:11] john wesley came under we know what the
[51:13] pentecostals came under
[51:15] but do we know what we came under
[51:21] see the mystery of his coming the
[51:22] mystery of his will the mystery of us
[51:24] sitting together remember
[51:26] it cannot be caught in any seminary it's
[51:28] a mystery
[51:29] you cannot know it by education by
[51:32] theology
[51:33] it's a mystery that's been hid since the
[51:35] foundation of the world look
[51:37] waiting for the manifestation of the
[51:39] sons of god
[51:40] listen tell me my brother tell me my
[51:43] sister when was the time that the sons
[51:45] of god was
[51:46] ever to be manifested outside of this
[51:49] time now
[51:52] listen there's been great things happen
[51:55] but a lot of that's been happening like
[51:56] see if
[51:57] under luther and under wesley they were
[51:59] still denominational i mean they weren't
[52:00] denominate listen they didn't denominate
[52:03] but their message was not fully complete
[52:05] their the mystery of the will of god
[52:07] is not that he's a trinity that's not
[52:10] the mystery of god
[52:12] the mystery is that they call it a
[52:14] trinity and he's one
[52:16] they the outside world the
[52:18] denominational world
[52:19] that's a mystery now look when was the
[52:21] time that the sons of god was ever to be
[52:23] manifested outside of this time
[52:24] now when were there ever a time in the
[52:27] history
[52:28] that this manifests the time to deliver
[52:31] all nature
[52:32] nature nature itself groaning waiting
[52:35] for the time of manifestation
[52:38] they're talking about now if you read
[52:39] them if you look on youtube and pull up
[52:41] some kind of earthquake i can't remember
[52:42] the name of it
[52:44] but this is one that's going to destroy
[52:45] california in about half of the united
[52:47] states
[52:48] they're already predicting it they're
[52:49] saying it's about 100 years overdue
[52:52] it came several thousand years ago and
[52:54] it's getting ready to come
[52:55] why is it always they always talk about
[52:57] california
[52:59] we had a prophet to tell us that that's
[53:02] exactly where that was going to happen
[53:03] amen so we already know what's going to
[53:05] happen we don't need somebody to give us
[53:07] a projection
[53:08] we know what's going to happen but it's
[53:11] going
[53:11] listen all nature anything that happens
[53:15] in nature
[53:15] i believe
[53:19] is that something's happening spiritual
[53:21] in the people
[53:23] do you think the natural is going to
[53:25] happen before the spiritual
[53:27] can't happen something in the spiritual
[53:30] world's got to happen first and then the
[53:32] natural will happen
[53:38] look why before the atonement was made
[53:41] before the holy ghost was ever poured
[53:42] out before all the old testament
[53:45] on down there couldn't have been
[53:47] manifestation now
[53:48] let's stop right there just a second
[53:50] there couldn't have been manifestation
[53:52] in the old testament
[53:53] now let me let me caution you what
[53:55] brother brown is saying remember
[53:58] because there was manifestation in the
[53:59] old testament
[54:01] there was healings there were signs
[54:03] there was wonders but that was for them
[54:06] that was for them to get through their
[54:07] journey for them to get through their
[54:09] life
[54:10] that was for them to come to a place to
[54:12] where god could put them in paradise as
[54:14] we were talking about
[54:15] waiting but there's nobody had
[54:19] the whole package deal like we have
[54:22] they did not have the new birth in the
[54:24] old testament amen
[54:27] so they were working under an anointing
[54:29] of the
[54:30] agape love i said anointing
[54:34] of that agape love because that agape
[54:37] love couldn't go inside of them
[54:39] but they had manifestations but not like
[54:41] the one brother brown was fixing to talk
[54:42] about
[54:44] why before the atonement was made before
[54:46] the holy ghost was ever poured out
[54:48] before all the old testament on down
[54:50] there that couldn't have been
[54:51] manifestation
[54:53] it had to wait till this time
[54:57] why because we've got everything right
[54:59] we should have already been done with
[55:00] our electives we should know how to read
[55:02] we should be into our core classes and
[55:05] getting ready to graduate
[55:08] it had to wait till this time now all
[55:11] things has been brought
[55:13] coming shaping up to a headstone to the
[55:16] manifestation of sons of god
[55:18] coming back in the spirit of god coming
[55:20] into these men
[55:22] so perfectly until their ministry will
[55:24] be so
[55:25] he said them not we know brother brown
[55:28] was
[55:30] but he's gone off the scene he brought
[55:33] us what we needed
[55:34] he's gone off the scene so men ministers
[55:37] laity also don't throw it all on us
[55:41] we got a job to do but so do you
[55:45] the bible didn't say study to show your
[55:46] pastor approved
[55:50] this study to show yourself approved and
[55:53] the spirit of god coming into these men
[55:55] so perfectly until
[55:56] their ministry
[55:59] now jesus christ didn't bring us
[56:04] let me rephrase that he brought us
[56:06] everything we need
[56:08] but when he preached those seals he
[56:10] sealed that thing back up
[56:12] until the end time so there's no way
[56:14] nobody could get it he preached the six
[56:15] seals in matthew 24
[56:17] but nobody understood it he died at
[56:19] calvary come back
[56:20] on the day of pentecost but then there
[56:23] has to be a growth development i'm
[56:25] reading what brother brown said not in
[56:26] the old testament
[56:28] and not him in the early because they
[56:30] don't have the headstone
[56:32] shaping up to a headstone which is what
[56:35] the head message
[56:36] the headmaster is on the scene now the
[56:39] the one that
[56:40] the super surgeon that can teach you
[56:42] every little thing you need to know
[56:45] amen he's not just a one-year doctor
[56:47] this guy we're talking about is an
[56:49] eternal doctor
[56:52] until their ministry would be so close
[56:53] like christ till the what it'll join him
[56:55] and his church together that's not
[56:57] filial love has
[56:58] nothing to do with filial love it's all
[56:59] agape love
[57:01] it'll join him and his church
[57:05] together now remember
[57:09] we're going to skip through this but for
[57:12] the sake of the
[57:13] visitors let's look we know that for
[57:14] knowledge let's go to number two
[57:18] that we always in the message you hear
[57:20] people preaching that you always was
[57:21] eternal and you always was this and you
[57:23] all
[57:23] in the mind of god you sure were
[57:29] but down here you were not
[57:32] you were born in sin you were a
[57:33] huckleberg you were dead
[57:35] you were born dead like i read that
[57:37] scripture that it
[57:38] that we're supposed to joy at the going
[57:41] home of a saint and cry when a
[57:42] baby's born we get it totally backwards
[57:45] why cry when the baby's born because
[57:46] you're looking at death brother brown
[57:47] said that and
[57:48] he said you're looking at death when the
[57:50] baby's born because that person if not
[57:54] he's going to go through life and going
[57:55] to die because that's what our
[57:57] that kind of birth but now thank god for
[57:59] the new birth
[58:01] that was real weak thank god for the new
[58:02] birth damn that's the best thing you
[58:04] should ever had
[58:07] how can i take a cuckleberry and make a
[58:09] grain of wheat out of it it's impossible
[58:11] for me to do it
[58:12] it's impossible for you to save your
[58:14] kids
[58:16] it's impossible for the pastor to save
[58:17] your kids
[58:20] but you can get them under the fountain
[58:22] enough and be enough of an example that
[58:25] they want i
[58:25] listen i wanted what he had
[58:29] he's my daddy i've got his
[58:31] characteristics i've got his dna running
[58:33] all through my
[58:34] body that's not what i wanted i got that
[58:36] whether i wanted it or not
[58:37] yeah you can prick your pick your
[58:39] friends but you can't pick your family
[58:43] so i was born in the same way born again
[58:45] of the spirit of god
[58:46] when you get born again spirit of god
[58:48] god can't deny you you're his child
[58:50] you have his dna but you still got to
[58:52] grow up
[58:54] you got to grow up so that somebody that
[58:56] died will be proud of us for the things
[58:58] that we do
[59:00] correct the only way it can be is
[59:03] because
[59:04] inside that cuckoo bird has been
[59:05] transmitted from a
[59:07] from a kokober wheat or a cuckoo bird to
[59:09] a germ called wheat
[59:11] life then you bury that kuckerberg and
[59:14] it'll produce a grain of wheat
[59:15] that's right because there has been a
[59:18] life of wheat
[59:19] put in that kuckleberg you've got to be
[59:22] born again you can't just sit in a
[59:23] message church
[59:24] i'm going to read you a quote in just a
[59:25] few minutes you can sit here you can sit
[59:28] here forever
[59:29] and say oh i love brother branham and i
[59:31] love this message just sounds so good
[59:35] oh come on now
[59:40] that's greasy grace so god's going to
[59:43] give me
[59:44] eternal life just because i lack or
[59:47] our filio love him no
[59:50] that's not what he's after he's after
[59:53] he's after his own love
[59:55] his own life and so we we i don't want
[59:58] to go through the dimensions again but
[1:00:00] we know
[1:00:00] that we come up here to the sixth
[1:00:02] dimension so let's go all the way if you
[1:00:03] don't mind brothers
[1:00:04] to where it says perfect love number
[1:00:08] seven
[1:00:09] so we won't be here so long we can have
[1:00:12] a
[1:00:14] fellowship downstairs bring it take it
[1:00:15] to number seven brother joe please where
[1:00:17] it says perfect
[1:00:18] love quote number seven you're gonna
[1:00:21] have to skip
[1:00:22] you're gonna have to go through five to
[1:00:24] four dimensions to get there
[1:00:26] five dimensions so there you go now he
[1:00:29] said i believe i was caught up to the
[1:00:30] sixth dimension looking back there could
[1:00:32] see back see the sight isn't exactly the
[1:00:34] eyes it's earthly but sight is a greater
[1:00:35] than that
[1:00:36] the sight that they have their contact
[1:00:38] is far beyond contact
[1:00:40] that our natural senses would contact
[1:00:46] we can't imagine that but listen if you
[1:00:50] get a revelation from god you're pretty
[1:00:51] close
[1:00:53] because it doesn't do anything for these
[1:00:54] eyes
[1:00:56] it does your spiritual eye it opens your
[1:00:58] spiritual eye
[1:00:59] into your soul that teaches you how to
[1:01:02] go up that statue of perfect man that
[1:01:03] gives you revelation
[1:01:05] that the trinity is not right and then
[1:01:07] see we should that should be all gone
[1:01:09] we should now see a revelation to where
[1:01:11] yeah sure we always was eternal but when
[1:01:13] a preacher preaches it like we didn't
[1:01:14] have nothing to do with it
[1:01:16] and we just was pulled through a tube
[1:01:18] and you know we just got to believe the
[1:01:19] message and i saw the prophet and i saw
[1:01:22] this one and i fished with this one and
[1:01:24] i read 12 books and i've read 2 000
[1:01:26] books and i've read the bible 300 times
[1:01:29] see what all that does is just
[1:01:35] paul said you can do all that and not
[1:01:38] have charity
[1:01:39] and you're a sounding brass and a
[1:01:41] tinkling symbol all those great look at
[1:01:43] caiaphas he stood there and i guarantee
[1:01:45] you caiaphas
[1:01:46] he knew he was a man of the hour because
[1:01:48] he was the he was the
[1:01:50] high priest he high priest meant he was
[1:01:52] the highest guy that could
[1:01:53] religious god on the earth at the time
[1:01:56] and he couldn't see that jesus christ
[1:01:58] was the son of god
[1:02:00] why because of the teaching that he'd
[1:02:03] come under
[1:02:05] the traditions didn't jesus tell him he
[1:02:07] said you've made these this tradition
[1:02:09] it's just tradition
[1:02:10] see if we made this even going to church
[1:02:12] if we made it just a tradition
[1:02:17] you know i said a minute ago you should
[1:02:18] be at church every time brother said
[1:02:19] every time a door opened you should be
[1:02:21] in church
[1:02:23] just saying but now you're saying well
[1:02:26] we don't have to go to church that's not
[1:02:27] what i'm saying
[1:02:29] you don't have to have a physical
[1:02:30] building
[1:02:32] to have a communion with god but you do
[1:02:36] need to come to church to have a better
[1:02:39] relationship
[1:02:40] with god everybody got that say amen
[1:02:44] wake up the ones beside you so they can
[1:02:45] say it too
[1:02:51] let's go to number eight i can't explain
[1:02:54] it this is when he went across the
[1:02:55] curtain of time
[1:02:57] let's go down there where it says and i
[1:02:59] said i don't understand this and the
[1:03:01] voice said this
[1:03:01] is perfect love said isn't that what you
[1:03:04] spoke the holy spirit was i said yes and
[1:03:06] this
[1:03:07] is perfect love
[1:03:11] where was he he was in the sixth
[1:03:12] dimension what did everybody in the
[1:03:14] sixth dimension have in common
[1:03:16] now remember they were blackheaded they
[1:03:18] were brown-headed they were
[1:03:20] they were blonds he said they were short
[1:03:23] they were tall
[1:03:24] he said the men had shaggy hair women
[1:03:26] had hair you know and had the robes on
[1:03:29] so that made them different
[1:03:32] right but they had one thing in common
[1:03:36] they had the new birth without the new
[1:03:39] birth you don't go into that sixth
[1:03:41] dimension
[1:03:42] so it doesn't matter see what i mean
[1:03:43] about all the electives and all the
[1:03:45] peripheral
[1:03:46] that doesn't matter until you get the
[1:03:47] new birth
[1:03:49] when you get the new birth that puts you
[1:03:51] in that place
[1:03:55] when god gives you the new birth he
[1:03:56] comes out of his dimension
[1:04:02] he's in the seventh right he comes out
[1:04:05] of his dimension and he gives you the
[1:04:06] new birth
[1:04:08] and that connects you with at least the
[1:04:09] sixth dimension because where's perfect
[1:04:13] love
[1:04:14] it resides in that sixth dimension and
[1:04:16] then what he just read
[1:04:18] this is perfect love so if you got
[1:04:20] perfect love that's what's connecting us
[1:04:23] with those people in that sixth
[1:04:24] dimension listen that's the reason
[1:04:26] that's the reason that even the bible
[1:04:28] without the bible i can see by
[1:04:30] revelation that somebody
[1:04:33] with perfect love is going to stand on
[1:04:37] this earth
[1:04:38] in a human body doesn't matter what the
[1:04:41] doctor says about you it doesn't matter
[1:04:43] what
[1:04:43] how age in the calendar you are doesn't
[1:04:46] make any difference
[1:04:48] they're going to stand on this earth and
[1:04:50] say death has been destroyed
[1:04:52] in this body because without that
[1:04:56] listen when jesus resurrected
[1:05:02] i like what somebody said and they
[1:05:04] preached a sermon on it and i can't
[1:05:05] remember who it was maybe
[1:05:06] danny steven a long time ago
[1:05:10] he said you know the resurrection
[1:05:11] message was not to dead people
[1:05:14] and a dead person can't give you the
[1:05:16] resurrection message
[1:05:19] a resurrection message has to be
[1:05:21] preached or
[1:05:22] spoken or shouted or trumpeted by a
[1:05:25] live human being in this dimension
[1:05:30] amen in this dimension not over there
[1:05:34] so we can't all get over there bob we'd
[1:05:36] be trapped
[1:05:38] somebody's got to have that same perfect
[1:05:41] love right here
[1:05:43] and listen folks that's the doctor
[1:05:47] that's the diploma you're looking for
[1:05:53] and you can get it because somebody's
[1:05:56] going to
[1:05:58] right right i like what my old football
[1:06:00] coach he said you either lead follow or
[1:06:02] get out of the way
[1:06:04] so i contend we got leaders and
[1:06:06] followers and
[1:06:07] we need to make sure we know where
[1:06:09] that's at but there's somebody who's
[1:06:10] going to bring us
[1:06:12] we know it's god almighty but he's going
[1:06:13] to bring it through the ministry because
[1:06:15] i just read to you what brother brown
[1:06:16] said a menace a group of people
[1:06:19] ministering the same message that jesus
[1:06:22] christ himself ministered on the face of
[1:06:23] the earth
[1:06:24] right amen it was so close to brother
[1:06:27] brown's time they thought he was god
[1:06:30] he said boy that's bad because i said
[1:06:32] well i told somebody the other day i
[1:06:34] said
[1:06:34] that's not too bad has anybody ever said
[1:06:37] you look like you god
[1:06:44] they said he's lived so close to god
[1:06:48] now we know he had a prophetic gift that
[1:06:50] you and i don't have but you know what
[1:06:51] we do have part of it
[1:06:53] he didn't take it all away i thought we
[1:06:56] were messiahs
[1:06:57] i thought we were little eagles i
[1:06:59] thought he connected us with that now
[1:07:01] it was in one man now send many people
[1:07:04] but how many somebody walked up to you
[1:07:05] anybody said well you remember that
[1:07:07] woman walked up to brother brown said
[1:07:09] brother brown said you forgive them
[1:07:11] people they're sin says you
[1:07:12] you acting like god he said wasn't too
[1:07:15] far from the truth
[1:07:17] he didn't say no no no no no he said
[1:07:19] wasn't too far from the truth
[1:07:23] so how we going to destroy death
[1:07:26] that's been the biggest question and
[1:07:29] it's just like i told you wednesday
[1:07:30] night
[1:07:31] somebody answer this how do you eat an
[1:07:33] elephant
[1:07:35] one piece at a time
[1:07:39] nothing special one piece at a time
[1:07:42] that's what we're doing we're chewing
[1:07:43] this thing one piece at a time
[1:07:45] we're going to make it
[1:07:49] this is perfect love now let's go down
[1:07:50] to number nine
[1:07:52] because we know what happened we know we
[1:07:54] went across the curtain of time and he
[1:07:55] said are these all branhams they said no
[1:07:56] they're your converts
[1:08:00] now let's go to number nine the hebrew
[1:08:01] series now watch
[1:08:03] the first is perfect love that's god's
[1:08:05] love pure
[1:08:07] and unadulterated the next coming there
[1:08:09] is filial love that's love that you have
[1:08:11] for your wife and your children
[1:08:13] the next drops that is lustful love the
[1:08:16] next is ungodly love and just goes on
[1:08:19] down till it's filled keep going on
[1:08:22] perverting
[1:08:23] and perverting he said everything has a
[1:08:24] beginning has to have an end listen
[1:08:27] felio love had a beginning lustful love
[1:08:31] had a beginning all
[1:08:32] agape love never had a beginning that is
[1:08:35] always eternal
[1:08:36] never will not be eternal agape love
[1:08:40] because listen
[1:08:41] the love of god is why this plan is
[1:08:43] eternal
[1:08:44] it's the love of god that he did not let
[1:08:48] us just go ahead and just
[1:08:49] the whole the whole world just die and
[1:08:52] just go off into oblivion and never to
[1:08:54] be remembered again
[1:08:55] he could have done that but he did not
[1:08:58] he knew there'd be a group of people
[1:09:00] that would yearn
[1:09:01] and groan and and
[1:09:04] burst the doors open if they had to to
[1:09:06] get in the church
[1:09:09] but see you can do that with filial love
[1:09:12] but if you bring that together and take
[1:09:15] it back up to agape love
[1:09:17] see agape love's not you know i love
[1:09:19] june as much as i i i
[1:09:21] more than i love anybody else but that's
[1:09:24] filial love
[1:09:25] because she's not born and i'm not born
[1:09:27] again there's no agape love
[1:09:30] if you're not born again amen
[1:09:33] that's why we can fellowship under agape
[1:09:35] love and it doesn't turn into that's why
[1:09:37] you see
[1:09:38] and and i'm just going to make it plain
[1:09:40] that's why you see many ministers even
[1:09:42] in the message and even out in the world
[1:09:44] they get caught with women and all these
[1:09:45] different things brother brown said
[1:09:47] money women in popularity were the three
[1:09:48] things you had to watch out for
[1:09:50] he knew that why because there was a
[1:09:52] spirit carried with each one of those
[1:09:54] and being a minister i was hoping dad
[1:09:56] would cover it this morning
[1:09:57] but see as a minister you have to be
[1:09:59] careful
[1:10:01] yeah because you are attractive even
[1:10:03] though
[1:10:04] ugly as we are we're attract the people
[1:10:06] bob don't laugh so hard
[1:10:08] you couldn't you didn't have to amend
[1:10:10] that nobody had amen now
[1:10:14] you get a looking kid though you got a
[1:10:15] problem with it but you understand
[1:10:17] though there's there's things comes with
[1:10:19] that there's an anointing there's a pull
[1:10:20] there's
[1:10:21] you don't want to you don't ever you
[1:10:23] know you don't want to be
[1:10:24] that's why when brother dale or any of
[1:10:26] us talk to you as a sister
[1:10:28] there is either our wife in there or
[1:10:30] something the door's open you understand
[1:10:32] what i mean because see that felio love
[1:10:34] gets so close to that agape love and
[1:10:36] then all of a sudden it
[1:10:38] it agape love can't go downward
[1:10:41] feel your love can go downward it can
[1:10:44] take you into lust and i just read it
[1:10:46] ungodly acts and all these different
[1:10:48] things so there is an
[1:10:49] anointing to that that you're born with
[1:10:55] but it's how you use it right
[1:10:58] didn't brother brown say they talked
[1:10:59] about pat boone he talked about
[1:11:01] uh elvis presley had an anointing
[1:11:04] on them but they took that anointing and
[1:11:06] sold it to the world
[1:11:08] and man i'm not gonna as like brother
[1:11:09] dale said he said um
[1:11:11] and and the analogy to this is is you
[1:11:13] know you you go to family reunions or
[1:11:15] something and
[1:11:16] and somebody's become a doctor and
[1:11:17] everybody's like oh man they're a doctor
[1:11:20] they've achieved something well what do
[1:11:22] you do well i'm a pastor of church
[1:11:24] okay no that's the highest office there
[1:11:28] is in the world
[1:11:30] er way past the president way past the
[1:11:32] senator way past a
[1:11:34] a stupid television personality
[1:11:38] a youtuber yeah
[1:11:42] a tick tocker deanna
[1:11:46] what's tick-tock i thought that was a
[1:11:48] clock
[1:11:50] no it's not i found that out see how
[1:11:53] that perverted though
[1:11:55] so you watch everybody all you watch
[1:11:57] because it starts going downward
[1:11:58] if you don't have agape love everything
[1:12:02] rolls downward
[1:12:03] and man so you and you're where you're
[1:12:05] getting further away from god
[1:12:07] not closer to god so be careful
[1:12:11] if you just live under feel your love
[1:12:12] that's my whole part
[1:12:14] just don't live underfield your love
[1:12:15] just make sure you get the baptism of
[1:12:17] the holy ghost
[1:12:18] that will hold you and will keep you
[1:12:22] in the time of trouble let's go to
[1:12:24] number 12. i'm going to skip a few of
[1:12:26] these if you don't mind
[1:12:27] and we'll uh want to look at this chart
[1:12:29] real quick
[1:12:30] then we'll go downstairs and eat some
[1:12:33] ice creams
[1:12:34] go to number 12. adoption see we're
[1:12:36] still an adoption series brother brown
[1:12:38] said look he said thus sayeth the lord
[1:12:40] it'll take perfect love to put you in
[1:12:42] that place he's talking about the
[1:12:43] sixth dimension for that's all there was
[1:12:46] there no matter how much how much
[1:12:49] religious demonstrations
[1:12:51] how many good deeds you've done or
[1:12:54] whatever you've done
[1:12:55] that won't count nothing on that day
[1:12:57] it'll take perfect
[1:12:59] love so whatever you do you lay aside
[1:13:02] everything else until you're just so
[1:13:04] filled with the love of god till you can
[1:13:06] love those that hate you
[1:13:08] i wrote myself a note i said look don't
[1:13:11] misrepresent that love with greasy grace
[1:13:14] don't rip misrepresent that love for
[1:13:17] just having affection
[1:13:20] because i'm going to tell you something
[1:13:22] if you're a child of god and you do
[1:13:24] something wrong
[1:13:24] you're going to pay for it
[1:13:28] you're going to pay for it
[1:13:32] and if you don't take the correction you
[1:13:34] know what it shows that you never had to
[1:13:35] start with
[1:13:36] you never had nothing to take you back
[1:13:38] to the correction
[1:13:39] because you're a bastard child and a
[1:13:42] bastard child is not a part of the
[1:13:43] family
[1:13:44] amen number 13 from this time on
[1:13:46] columbus falls oregon
[1:13:48] and i looked and people was coming from
[1:13:49] everywhere and i said what is this
[1:13:51] that voice now
[1:13:55] from no one the same voice that spoke
[1:13:56] the room is still with me says this is
[1:13:58] perfect love
[1:13:59] i've always taught the evidence of the
[1:14:01] holy ghost is perfect love see i believe
[1:14:03] in speaking in tongues sure
[1:14:06] but though i speak with tongue of men
[1:14:07] and angels wow
[1:14:10] and have not charity i'm nothing he's
[1:14:11] quoting scripture i am nothing become a
[1:14:14] sounding brass and a tinkling symbol so
[1:14:16] when you speak with tongues and got love
[1:14:18] with it that'll show now
[1:14:19] see that's where he puts everything back
[1:14:21] together he's saying well i'm not
[1:14:22] throwing tongues out
[1:14:25] i hope we start and you know the nine
[1:14:27] spiritual gifts that brother dale's
[1:14:28] talking about
[1:14:29] when you say when i say nine spiritual
[1:14:31] gifts
[1:14:32] you go to two yeah most of you
[1:14:36] cannot give me the other seven yeah
[1:14:39] right i'm just gonna put you on the spot
[1:14:42] most of you can't don't look in your
[1:14:44] bible don't cheat
[1:14:47] what's another one thank you
[1:14:50] what's another one faith
[1:15:00] wisdom was the next one huh discernment
[1:15:05] there's a few more and i can't really
[1:15:06] name them all but everybody says oh we
[1:15:08] got to have
[1:15:09] the nine spiritual gifts speaking in
[1:15:11] tongues and interpretation
[1:15:13] major not a minor that's the last two
[1:15:16] what about we do have gifts of wisdom in
[1:15:18] this church we do have give
[1:15:20] gifts of faith of knowledge and all the
[1:15:22] different things in this church
[1:15:24] working in this church but you say well
[1:15:26] you don't got no gifts because you don't
[1:15:27] have tongues and interpretation
[1:15:29] that's just part of it that's not all of
[1:15:32] it
[1:15:32] it's the nine spiritual gifts maybe if
[1:15:34] you'll read them it'll be easier for
[1:15:35] brother they'll preach next time
[1:15:37] yeah amen
[1:15:41] look at number 14. just remember i'll
[1:15:44] say this with the faith that i have in
[1:15:45] that vision whatever it was i'll speak
[1:15:47] in the name of the lord
[1:15:48] except you have that perfect faith
[1:15:49] you'll never be there because
[1:15:51] nothing could ever be there without it
[1:15:53] look your spirit would be out of place
[1:15:55] there now let me ask you a question
[1:15:59] if you're born again today your spirit
[1:16:01] is out of place to the world amen
[1:16:07] your spirit is out of place in this
[1:16:10] world if you think when you go home
[1:16:12] today there's
[1:16:13] i was watching people in the airport the
[1:16:16] other day we were
[1:16:17] going to arizona and i was watching
[1:16:20] people and a man and his wife and
[1:16:22] two kids come and sit in front of us
[1:16:24] they were discussing things and
[1:16:26] you know i don't know exactly but here's
[1:16:27] the way i see the conversation you know
[1:16:29] they're going snowboarding
[1:16:30] they're going to phoenix because they
[1:16:31] can snowboard you know there's a big
[1:16:33] mountain there you can still snowboard
[1:16:34] off of so they're going to snowboard
[1:16:35] and then they're going to do this and
[1:16:37] then they're going to do that he gets on
[1:16:38] the phone and she goes and does her
[1:16:41] and i know they're not believers i mean
[1:16:42] they all had on shorts and
[1:16:44] you understand what i mean so i know
[1:16:45] they could be nominal christian
[1:16:47] but what were they doing their spirit
[1:16:49] was familiar with the world
[1:16:51] their spirit and i'm not saying you
[1:16:53] don't need to do that i'm just saying
[1:16:55] their spirit was so familiar though that
[1:16:56] if you would say hey we're gonna have
[1:16:58] church service
[1:16:59] sunday and you're gonna be right there
[1:17:00] in flagstaff
[1:17:02] just come and have service with us it's
[1:17:03] only going to be maybe 20 miles from
[1:17:05] your snowboarding event
[1:17:07] well then look at you and what do you
[1:17:09] mean we're out here to snowboard we're
[1:17:11] not here to have fun
[1:17:13] we're on vacation what are you asking us
[1:17:15] to go to church see but if what if it
[1:17:17] had
[1:17:17] the same spirit that gave it right
[1:17:20] what if you'd had the same spirit that
[1:17:22] gave it right if you got the same spirit
[1:17:24] that gave it then it will react and say
[1:17:26] oh
[1:17:27] there's a church there 20 minutes away
[1:17:31] i mean the first time and we were
[1:17:34] thinking about going hunting in illinois
[1:17:36] i searched high and low i called brother
[1:17:38] larry harry i called it a lot brother
[1:17:39] joel forney i called everybody i knew
[1:17:41] that knew where these little churches
[1:17:42] were spread out and
[1:17:44] southern illinois is a is it they're
[1:17:47] dead
[1:17:49] they ain't a messy church within two
[1:17:50] hours of their that place
[1:17:52] but we knew brother byler was there when
[1:17:54] you brother richard hyatt was there
[1:17:55] right on the way up and right on the way
[1:17:57] back so we made our
[1:17:59] journey based on that because you know
[1:18:02] what my
[1:18:03] my spirit now listen i don't have a i
[1:18:05] don't have a problem with hunting on
[1:18:06] sunday if i'm way off somewhere
[1:18:08] i don't now brother dale's made a pact
[1:18:10] with god that he wasn't going to do that
[1:18:11] but now brother brown said
[1:18:13] if you were far enough off so you
[1:18:15] understand what i mean i'm not so
[1:18:16] dogmatic
[1:18:17] but if you're around somewhere that
[1:18:18] you're you're free you're familiar
[1:18:20] spirit like one day brother dale and
[1:18:21] then were in
[1:18:22] colorado and couldn't well they weren't
[1:18:23] a message church where they were at
[1:18:25] anyway him and brother mike and a couple
[1:18:27] other brothers
[1:18:28] they met in a cafe and just had a little
[1:18:30] church service why they was familiar
[1:18:33] their spirits were familiar they wanted
[1:18:34] to go to church they wanted to do things
[1:18:37] you know birds of a feather flock
[1:18:38] together and all those different things
[1:18:39] but look
[1:18:40] if your spirit your spirit would be out
[1:18:42] of place there
[1:18:44] it couldn't come there'd be no way for
[1:18:46] it to come how many people have you seen
[1:18:47] come into this church sometimes think
[1:18:49] they're gonna go to that one
[1:18:51] they get real nervous and they leave
[1:18:53] pretty quick when the service is over or
[1:18:55] they look around and they realize
[1:18:56] they're in the wrong church
[1:18:58] i'm not saying anything i'm just saying
[1:19:00] that maybe that familiar
[1:19:01] that spirit they have is not familiar
[1:19:03] with the spirit that's in here
[1:19:05] or vice versa you understand what i'm
[1:19:08] saying
[1:19:10] your spirit you say no that's for them
[1:19:11] people in the sixth dimension listen
[1:19:13] if you ain't got that same spirit
[1:19:19] you ain't going there because the spirit
[1:19:22] you got
[1:19:22] is not familiar with that place but if
[1:19:25] you'll get the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:19:27] say look no more than it would be for a
[1:19:29] grain of corn
[1:19:30] to raise up out of the ground without a
[1:19:32] germ of life in it
[1:19:34] it'd be horrible to see corn up this
[1:19:36] tall out in my garden and not one ear on
[1:19:38] it
[1:19:39] yeah we'll see but look that's not the
[1:19:41] characteristics of the corn unless it's
[1:19:43] been
[1:19:45] i guess unless it's been the
[1:19:47] gene's been
[1:19:48] but it's got a german life in it it's
[1:19:50] got to produce what it is
[1:19:52] same way with me and you your german
[1:19:55] wife will produce
[1:19:56] listen and in this day and time you
[1:19:58] can't hide it
[1:20:00] this is not the hiding time you cannot
[1:20:02] hide this
[1:20:04] at all let's listen watch this next one
[1:20:09] way of have fellowship 1955 number 15.
[1:20:13] listen to this i'd rather have a church
[1:20:15] listen just a moment
[1:20:17] i'd rather have a church that knows
[1:20:19] nothing about any spiritual gift
[1:20:21] and just be so in love with each other
[1:20:24] and with christ now if you cut it off
[1:20:25] right there you say well brother brown
[1:20:26] didn't believe in spiritual gifts
[1:20:29] what he's saying is we're not going to
[1:20:30] hold on that that's what christ is but
[1:20:32] watch
[1:20:33] all right i'd rather have that
[1:20:38] than every spiritual gift operating in
[1:20:40] the church now that might sound hard on
[1:20:42] a pentecostal group
[1:20:44] but i would rather have it where there
[1:20:46] is gifts they'll fail
[1:20:48] where there's gifts they'll bring
[1:20:50] confusion now he's talking about the
[1:20:51] gifts they were talking about
[1:20:53] where there is gifts they can be
[1:20:54] questioned but where there is
[1:20:56] love it is perfect that's right
[1:21:00] and if you had perfect love now watch
[1:21:02] you'd have perfect gifts
[1:21:05] so he's not doing away with the gift he
[1:21:08] was doing away with what they thought
[1:21:09] the gift was
[1:21:11] see that whole group of pentecostals was
[1:21:12] sitting there saying if you don't
[1:21:14] in their mind all right little man if
[1:21:17] you don't tell these people that
[1:21:18] speaking in tongues is the evidence
[1:21:20] you're wrong that's what he was picking
[1:21:23] up the spirit of the
[1:21:24] other people he said no you can speak in
[1:21:26] tongues all you want to
[1:21:28] you have all that kind of gifts but if
[1:21:30] you've got a gothic love look
[1:21:32] and if you had perfect love you'd have
[1:21:34] perfect gifts
[1:21:35] so work first with love
[1:21:38] that brings fellowship and fellowship
[1:21:41] brings gifts
[1:21:44] that's the way to do it right there get
[1:21:46] to get the new birth get the perfect
[1:21:48] love
[1:21:49] then that brings fellowship and
[1:21:51] fellowship will bring the gifts
[1:21:54] what it'll bring the right gift now
[1:21:56] let's look at number 16. this is christ
[1:21:58] revealed in his own word
[1:22:01] that laodicean church is naked blind
[1:22:02] miserable don't even know it see
[1:22:05] it's that anointed anointed with the
[1:22:07] real spirit see
[1:22:09] that holy spirit can fall upon a man in
[1:22:11] his spirit
[1:22:13] but his soul is his germ that germ is
[1:22:15] the word
[1:22:16] see how i don't care how much you can
[1:22:18] preach
[1:22:19] how well you do this and how much you
[1:22:21] love
[1:22:23] that's one of the inlets to the spirit
[1:22:25] you can't love with your body
[1:22:28] you love with your spirit that's one of
[1:22:31] the inlets
[1:22:32] and you can love and even love god and
[1:22:35] still
[1:22:35] not be right you can cast out devils
[1:22:40] and preach and do these things still not
[1:22:43] be right jesus said many
[1:22:44] would come in that day that word
[1:22:48] is what settles it number 17 perfect
[1:22:51] faith
[1:22:52] sorry bob and when we were sinners i'm
[1:22:56] going to read the quote anyway you might
[1:22:57] read it too
[1:22:58] he said he's going to preach on perfect
[1:22:59] faith wednesday night so
[1:23:01] and when we preachers can't get together
[1:23:04] and talk to each other about nothing
[1:23:06] we'll get each other's well anyway and
[1:23:08] when we were
[1:23:09] sinners alienated
[1:23:12] without god pretty awful isn't it
[1:23:16] in the world in that muck of mud have i
[1:23:19] hit anybody
[1:23:20] yet should have been the whole
[1:23:22] congregation
[1:23:23] especially those of you that are asleep
[1:23:27] as i talked about this morning god come
[1:23:29] to us god sought you you never sought
[1:23:31] god
[1:23:32] no man can come to me except the father
[1:23:34] draws him first
[1:23:36] and god came down in that muck what you
[1:23:39] were
[1:23:39] and sought you out and brought you out
[1:23:42] that ought to create
[1:23:44] a perfect love look what you was
[1:23:48] and look what you are
[1:23:51] what did that somebody that loved you
[1:23:55] not with a not with felio love can't you
[1:23:58] have faith in what he's promised you
[1:24:00] then
[1:24:01] real genuine love will create
[1:24:04] a confidence in his word
[1:24:07] not a confidence in the gifts and all
[1:24:09] that confidence in his word
[1:24:11] now the word listen gifts is part of the
[1:24:13] word but if you don't get the giver
[1:24:14] first
[1:24:16] if you don't get the perfect love first
[1:24:17] and the perfect faith first then you
[1:24:19] will
[1:24:20] what brother brown said the pentecostals
[1:24:22] they cabbage down on what just those two
[1:24:23] gifts
[1:24:24] exactly and it didn't go any further
[1:24:28] there was all that other to go to and
[1:24:29] they they what they turned it down
[1:24:34] because they didn't have a confidence of
[1:24:36] course it wasn't a word for them
[1:24:38] we should have confidence real genuine
[1:24:40] love will create a confidence
[1:24:42] in his word
[1:24:45] i'm gonna read these quotes right here
[1:24:46] real quick matthew or matthew 7 verse 21
[1:24:49] they don't have it and then we'll look
[1:24:50] at the chart for a minute and then we'll
[1:24:51] go downstairs
[1:24:53] matthew 7 verse 21 says not everyone
[1:24:55] that saith unto me lord lord shall enter
[1:24:57] into the kingdom of heaven
[1:24:58] but he that doeth the will of my father
[1:25:00] which is in heaven
[1:25:01] many will say to me in that day now he
[1:25:03] didn't say one or two
[1:25:06] many will say to me in that day lord
[1:25:09] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[1:25:12] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[1:25:15] in thy name
[1:25:16] done many wonderful works
[1:25:20] matthew 7 verse 23 says and then i will
[1:25:23] profes
[1:25:23] profess unto them i never
[1:25:27] knew you depart from me ye
[1:25:30] that work iniquity
[1:25:34] now that word new is not like i knew
[1:25:37] this brother right here or this sister
[1:25:39] right here that new goes back to where
[1:25:41] adam knew his wife eve in other words
[1:25:42] they had an intimate
[1:25:44] relationship he's telling the people
[1:25:47] you loved me with filial love
[1:25:50] right but you never entered in and and
[1:25:54] loved me with agape love
[1:25:57] you loved me so far but you didn't go
[1:26:00] any further
[1:26:02] you didn't you didn't seek me
[1:26:05] so much to where everything i give you
[1:26:10] is agape love listen to this be certain
[1:26:12] of god sometimes
[1:26:13] faith will do great miracles and still
[1:26:14] doesn't come from a spiritual heart
[1:26:16] oh my goodness do not our lord say many
[1:26:20] will come in that day and have not
[1:26:21] done this and done that i will confess
[1:26:23] to them depart from me
[1:26:24] what is iniquity is something that you
[1:26:26] know to do right and don't do it i
[1:26:28] never knew you he will say and we're
[1:26:31] living in that day
[1:26:33] so he penned it right here queen of
[1:26:36] sheba 1959 what a disappointment it's
[1:26:38] going to be a judgment when men who
[1:26:40] thought that they were all right
[1:26:42] because they had faith to heal the sick
[1:26:44] they had faith to operate a gift
[1:26:47] and had great meetings great
[1:26:49] evangelistic services
[1:26:51] and one soul
[1:26:56] let that sink in and one souls
[1:27:00] in other words god used them to bring
[1:27:04] somebody
[1:27:06] to christ and they didn't have christ in
[1:27:08] them themselves
[1:27:10] jesus has forewarned us of these things
[1:27:13] many will come to me in that day and say
[1:27:14] lord have i not cast out devils
[1:27:16] and your name done many mighty works
[1:27:19] then he would then he said he would
[1:27:20] confess depart from me you workers of
[1:27:22] iniquity i never knew you
[1:27:24] it takes more than the power of gifts
[1:27:27] it takes more than joining a church it
[1:27:30] takes the birth of the holy spirit to
[1:27:32] break down our walls
[1:27:34] and unite us together as one great
[1:27:36] christian body moving for
[1:27:38] one objective one objective and one goal
[1:27:43] and that's the body change
[1:27:47] but remember don't jump up and get that
[1:27:49] diploma
[1:27:51] right off the bat ain't going to happen
[1:27:55] you got to go through listen this
[1:27:57] message was given to us
[1:27:59] to give us the opportunity to take a
[1:28:02] body change
[1:28:04] it gave us all the others too it gave us
[1:28:07] everything else the spiritual gifts he
[1:28:08] like brother brown lined everything up
[1:28:10] for us
[1:28:11] that was the elijah spirit where he
[1:28:13] lined everything up remember the elijah
[1:28:14] in the old testament
[1:28:16] the prophets of baal they jumped on the
[1:28:19] altar so much till they knocked every
[1:28:20] stone off of its place
[1:28:22] and what the bible say elijah restored
[1:28:27] the altar in other words that spirit of
[1:28:30] elijah took the pieces those stones
[1:28:32] those revelations
[1:28:34] that they didn't get and he what he
[1:28:36] rebuilt that altar
[1:28:38] when he rebuilt the altar what happened
[1:28:40] god came down
[1:28:42] and vindicated that prophet he didn't
[1:28:44] just consume the sacrifice he consumed
[1:28:46] the water that was in the hole around it
[1:28:49] amen so now joe if you want to pull up
[1:28:52] that real quick we'll be done right here
[1:28:54] about five minutes we hadn't been
[1:28:56] talking about this some of you have
[1:28:58] around there or you can get one of these
[1:28:59] right here
[1:29:01] we've been talking about right here this
[1:29:02] is what we've been on is
[1:29:04] redemption and we did this a long time
[1:29:07] ago and
[1:29:08] and uh brother joe found it again so we
[1:29:11] got it so the world as we know it is
[1:29:12] light
[1:29:13] life and matter which is the first three
[1:29:15] dimensions then here's the
[1:29:17] adam and eve and the creation see
[1:29:18] remember they were not down here right
[1:29:21] genesis 2 16 17 luke 3 38
[1:29:24] adam and eve fell in genesis 3. well
[1:29:27] where'd they fall
[1:29:28] they fell down to time nobody got that
[1:29:31] say amen they failed a time
[1:29:33] this is the timeline this is where time
[1:29:36] where we've got days and weeks and
[1:29:38] months and years this is a timeline
[1:29:40] that goes all the way from when they
[1:29:42] fail the fall that's why they call it a
[1:29:44] fall because they fail
[1:29:46] they fell to time but now see god still
[1:29:49] had to what
[1:29:50] he then death came on the scene
[1:29:53] there had to be a here's paradise abel
[1:29:56] genesis 4
[1:29:57] 8 abel went into paradise we already
[1:29:59] read who all went into paradise
[1:30:01] because look jesus christ hadn't died
[1:30:03] yet
[1:30:04] they were covered under the blood
[1:30:06] sacrifice of bulls and goats
[1:30:08] but it didn't do away with sin it only
[1:30:10] covered their sin we read that
[1:30:12] so nobody in the old testament had the
[1:30:14] new birth even john the baptist
[1:30:17] did not have the new birth now he had
[1:30:20] the holy spirit
[1:30:24] on his spirit not in the soul
[1:30:28] because the kingdom started right here
[1:30:30] on the day of pentecost
[1:30:32] here's the seventh dimension listen god
[1:30:34] never came out he's still
[1:30:36] he can get he's in that sixth seventh
[1:30:38] dimension you got that
[1:30:39] now watch what happened we're gonna go
[1:30:41] right here and then we'll quit because i
[1:30:42] want to go to right here before we
[1:30:43] preach and then we'll start next
[1:30:45] next sunday so the first person to die
[1:30:48] was abel so he went into a place called
[1:30:49] paradise
[1:30:50] now look those who turn god down though
[1:30:53] there is a fifth dimension look how long
[1:30:55] that fifth dimension is
[1:30:57] jesus preached to the ones who turned
[1:30:59] god down in first peter 3 18-19 we read
[1:31:01] that
[1:31:02] see they're never going to live until
[1:31:03] the white throne judgment right
[1:31:05] they're going to be in a place of like a
[1:31:07] complete nightmare
[1:31:08] then the second resume resurrection is
[1:31:10] going to happen this is the white throne
[1:31:12] judgment
[1:31:13] everybody got that now me and you
[1:31:16] we drop down here into time
[1:31:19] this is us church ages holy ghost fell
[1:31:22] on the day of pentecost
[1:31:24] it's been what putting people in the
[1:31:26] body of christ then we're going to take
[1:31:28] a rapture so we're going to be all up
[1:31:29] here safe
[1:31:31] because this is all going to be
[1:31:32] destruction down here because also
[1:31:33] remember
[1:31:34] paradise was emptied out when jesus came
[1:31:37] up
[1:31:38] when he died went down preached to
[1:31:40] people in hell come back up
[1:31:43] on resurrection morning everybody got
[1:31:46] that
[1:31:47] now we'll stop right there you still got
[1:31:50] it still paradise though was emptied out
[1:31:51] here and become the sixth dimension
[1:31:53] now remember the six dimensions gonna be
[1:31:55] emptied out
[1:31:58] on the right in the rapture of the bride
[1:32:00] that six dimension is going to be
[1:32:02] totally emptied out and you're not going
[1:32:03] to see it anymore because what are we
[1:32:04] going to do
[1:32:05] they're going to come here walk 30 or 40
[1:32:06] days then we're going up in a rapture
[1:32:09] up into this dimension where there's
[1:32:12] there's no sixth it's all seventh
[1:32:14] because see where we're going to meet
[1:32:15] god we're gonna meet god where
[1:32:18] in the air he's gonna take us up to a
[1:32:20] wedding supper
[1:32:21] and he's gonna be there amen he's gonna
[1:32:24] be right there with us the whole time
[1:32:26] if you want one of these you can come
[1:32:27] get it there's some in the back back
[1:32:28] there but that's where we're
[1:32:29] going to get to we're going to talk a
[1:32:31] little bit about the 7th dimension next
[1:32:33] sunday
[1:32:34] and then continue down our line but but
[1:32:36] it took 15
[1:32:37] sermons to get us to about right here to
[1:32:40] get right here where the birth of jesus
[1:32:41] is but everybody understand what i'm
[1:32:44] saying we place this this is all
[1:32:47] part of redemption glory even the fifth
[1:32:50] dimension
[1:32:51] there's got to be dimensions inside of
[1:32:53] dimensions because we know the sixth
[1:32:54] dimension was
[1:32:58] everybody got that the six dimensions
[1:33:00] got dimensions in it because brother
[1:33:02] brad said where's
[1:33:03] where's paul well if he was in the sixth
[1:33:06] dimension and we know paul made it to
[1:33:08] the sixth dimension
[1:33:10] but like the angel told brother branham
[1:33:12] he said you'll be gathered with your
[1:33:14] people
[1:33:15] the bible tells us he goes back into
[1:33:17] where jacob and i've been reading in the
[1:33:19] kings and
[1:33:19] in first and second samuel every time a
[1:33:22] king died or every time a good one died
[1:33:24] like solomon and david
[1:33:25] they were gathered with their people and
[1:33:27] they're put into it
[1:33:29] into a holding place so same way brother
[1:33:31] branham is waiting now brother ray
[1:33:32] is in that place he's not he's not
[1:33:36] conversing with martin luther he's not
[1:33:39] conversing with john wesley
[1:33:41] he's probably still hanging around
[1:33:42] brother dick
[1:33:44] so but you know what thank god
[1:33:49] that's more real than we are that has
[1:33:52] substance to it this you're saying oh
[1:33:54] this is this is hard this
[1:33:56] no that's got more substance than
[1:33:57] anything that's eternal
[1:33:59] there's no part of that not eternal here
[1:34:02] we are here we're now
[1:34:03] eternal in our soul but we're still
[1:34:06] human in our body we have a
[1:34:10] cocklebur that we're living in
[1:34:17] but we're going to another place
[1:34:20] we're going to contend that this
[1:34:21] kuckerberg is going to be changed into a
[1:34:24] wheat
[1:34:25] right here in front of the devil in his
[1:34:28] playground in his eden in his place of
[1:34:31] worship
[1:34:34] this is satan's eden right this is
[1:34:37] satan's place of worship
[1:34:38] it's just where he's wanted to be
[1:34:40] because he wants to deceive
[1:34:42] as many as he can let's stand our feet
[1:34:45] musicians come
[1:34:49] but eternal redemption that's right
[1:34:53] started before the foundation of the
[1:34:54] world and never will end you know what
[1:34:55] when we get over on the other side we
[1:34:57] keep running into eternity
[1:34:59] we're going to know that that man named
[1:35:01] jesus
[1:35:02] died for us and he didn't have to he's
[1:35:05] our father
[1:35:08] he's our brother he's everything to me
[1:35:11] y'all seen that song didn't you he's
[1:35:14] everything he's everything to me you
[1:35:16] don't have to

[1:38:50] original life
[1:38:53] is the original life
[1:38:58] [Music]
[1:39:10] is
[1:39:13] [Music]
[1:39:19] amen we are called into adoption full
[1:39:21] authority and power
[1:39:23] sleep in saints will wake and join us
[1:39:25] for translation
[1:39:26] in that hour you know all this
[1:39:32] when you first come in the message or
[1:39:33] you first come to the lord a lot of
[1:39:34] things are
[1:39:35] they're not fairy tales but it's
[1:39:37] something that you say well i don't know
[1:39:38] if i can attain to that or not
[1:39:40] well see that'd be the first thing zach
[1:39:41] would do if he went down here to
[1:39:43] to emory university and walked in and
[1:39:45] said i want to be a surgeon
[1:39:48] they'd walk him through and they'd watch
[1:39:50] him do an operation or watch him do some
[1:39:53] something you know in science and it'd
[1:39:55] be overwhelming wouldn't it
[1:39:58] real overwhelming wasn't it but you know
[1:40:00] what
[1:40:01] that guy that was operating on the table
[1:40:03] was sitting in the same place he was
[1:40:04] sitting in
[1:40:05] six or eight years before that so what
[1:40:07] am i saying it takes that time
[1:40:10] it takes that responsibility number one
[1:40:13] to say hey
[1:40:14] i'm gonna be a surgeon i'm gonna be a
[1:40:16] doctor so
[1:40:17] all right if you're gonna be a doctor
[1:40:18] this is what you're gonna do all right
[1:40:19] so if you wanna take a body change
[1:40:21] this is what you got to do eat the
[1:40:23] elephant
[1:40:25] one bite at a time but if you fall off
[1:40:29] and don't do
[1:40:30] what the word says then you know you
[1:40:32] have to stop for a little while you may
[1:40:34] you may have to uh you know we always
[1:40:36] talked about
[1:40:37] uh skipping grades and and then some
[1:40:40] were
[1:40:41] unfortunate enough to get held back a
[1:40:44] year
[1:40:46] why because they didn't understand all
[1:40:48] the teeth that's not anything to say
[1:40:49] you know derogatory but the same way in
[1:40:51] the word of god
[1:40:52] [Music]
[1:40:53] it's what you eat it's what you
[1:40:57] feel that's important because that can
[1:40:59] put his whole life into going to school
[1:41:02] and and become a wonderful surgeon
[1:41:06] or he can go down there and he can party
[1:41:08] and he can you know understand what a
[1:41:09] man you can
[1:41:10] part of your way through school well you
[1:41:12] ain't gonna graduate yeah
[1:41:14] okay same way with the word of god you
[1:41:16] say part well you know a lot of times
[1:41:18] if you don't have agape love i'm telling
[1:41:21] you if you don't have agape love you
[1:41:23] will head toward filial love and it'll
[1:41:25] start rolling downhill every time
[1:41:27] because satan loves that filial love
[1:41:29] because he wants you that's why it's
[1:41:30] called filial love because
[1:41:32] it feels good agape love most of the
[1:41:36] time don't feel real good
[1:41:38] when god's hammering on you and trying
[1:41:40] to get you straightened down trying to
[1:41:41] chisel them pieces off of you
[1:41:43] listen i don't think it's chiseling time
[1:41:45] folks i think brother brown where
[1:41:46] brother brown said now it's time
[1:41:47] that you got to just take the sandpaper
[1:41:50] with michelangelo he beat them big
[1:41:52] pieces off of that statue and there was
[1:41:53] big chunks laying on the floor
[1:41:55] but when he got ready to do his detailed
[1:41:57] work
[1:41:59] he used little fine sandpaper
[1:42:02] and he got right down there close and he
[1:42:05] he'd sand this part and sand this part
[1:42:07] none of this big knocking off
[1:42:08] we've been through all that we've been
[1:42:11] through that
[1:42:12] let's get down to the fine points
[1:42:15] the honey brother brown said this is the
[1:42:17] honing age well that what honing is not
[1:42:19] chopping
[1:42:20] big chunks off honing is getting what
[1:42:22] your knife real sharp
[1:42:24] it's honing it down to a razor's edge so
[1:42:27] that we can get uh
[1:42:29] are they ready okay all right well god
[1:42:31] bless you we love you with love with
[1:42:32] lord
[1:42:33] we're gonna go downstairs and eat cake
[1:42:34] and ice cream and when we dismiss just
[1:42:36] head on down there
[1:42:37] and if you don't want to get too crowded
[1:42:39] inside it's a beautiful day outside you
[1:42:41] can go sit outside
[1:42:42] if you want to do a little social
[1:42:43] distance then because you can't eat cake
[1:42:44] with that thing you got on your face
[1:42:48] right so you'll have to eat with your
