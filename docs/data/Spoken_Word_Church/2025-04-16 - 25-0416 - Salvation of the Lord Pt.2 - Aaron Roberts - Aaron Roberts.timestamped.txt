[0:00] of
[0:01] God. Ever
[0:03] true, changing
[0:06] me, changing
[0:08] you. We have come with God's heart. Oh,
[0:14] let the word of God.
[0:18] [Music]
[0:22] Amen. Amen.
[0:25] And we can say that he's come to you,
[0:28] spoke to you. Amen. Amen.
[0:31] Through this word,
[0:33] because he is the word. Amen. I want him
[0:37] to continue to change me.
[0:41] And so,
[0:43] it's a wonderful atmosphere to be
[0:45] standing in tonight. Amen.
[0:48] And it's always good to be in the house
[0:49] of the Lord. Amen. Y'all can have your
[0:52] seats.
[1:00] I
[1:04] uh might think it's strange, but for
[1:08] some reason today I kept trying to
[1:09] figure out what today
[1:12] was all day. Today I kept thinking
[1:15] there's what's the significance of today
[1:17] I kept trying to it's like I ought to
[1:19] ought to know. It's like I ought to
[1:21] know. And I spent all day trying to
[1:23] figure out what it was. And I finally
[1:25] realized it was Pop's birthday
[1:27] today. And everybody always likes me to
[1:29] sing.
[1:39] And
[1:43] it's But if if there's one song in this
[1:46] world I think about pop
[1:49] singing, it's this song.
[1:53] God's
[1:54] children too
[1:56] long have been burdened.
[2:02] They are
[2:04] longing for
[2:07] heaven's green
[2:09] [Music]
[2:12] shore where
[2:15] heartaches are
[2:17] left far behind
[2:22] us and
[2:25] burdens are
[2:27] carried no
[2:30] [Music]
[2:32] Oh, come
[2:35] morning I'll
[2:37] walk by the
[2:40] [Music]
[2:43] river. I'll
[2:46] resting the
[2:48] evergreen tree.
[2:54] I'll
[2:56] carry my
[2:58] cross through the
[3:03] midnight. Come
[3:06] morning there's
[3:09] glory for
[3:13] me. Sometimes
[3:17] I'm
[3:19] despised and rejected.
[3:22] [Music]
[3:25] And I
[3:27] question, oh
[3:29] father, how
[3:34] long? Then I take
[3:37] one more
[3:39] look at my calary.
[3:46] And it gives
[3:47] me the strength
[3:50] to
[3:55] go. Come
[3:58] morning I
[4:00] walk by the river.
[4:07] I'll rest
[4:09] near the
[4:11] evergreen
[4:13] [Music]
[4:16] tree. I'll
[4:19] carry my
[4:21] cross through the
[4:23] [Music]
[4:26] midnight. Come
[4:29] morning, there's
[4:31] glory for me.
[4:37] Come
[4:39] morning I'll
[4:41] walk by the
[4:44] river. Some morning between 6:00 and 9
[4:48] I'll
[4:49] restate the
[4:51] ever green tree.
[4:58] I'll
[4:59] carry my
[5:02] cross through a
[5:06] midnight. But come
[5:10] morning, there's
[5:12] glory for
[5:18] free. Yes, sir.
[5:25] Amen. We have a promise.
[5:28] Amen. It won't be long. Nope. And we'll
[5:32] see them again.
[5:34] Thank the Lord for that.
[5:37] Amen. Let's all
[5:47] stand. I wish I could put into words
[5:49] what pop meant to me, but
[5:55] I just can't say it.
[6:01] But we thank God for his life and his
[6:04] testimony
[6:06] and his
[6:10] ministry and all that we're able to
[6:13] accomplish in the kingdom of
[6:19] God. Absolutely. Amen.
[6:33] for us to follow. Yeah. Amen.
[6:42] As the scripture said, follow me as I
[6:45] follow Christ. As Paul said,
[6:48] that's a man followed Christ. No doubt.
[6:52] Amen. If you have your Bibles tonight,
[6:54] let's go to uh 2 Samuel chapter 22apter.
[7:07] And I
[7:10] uh wanted to
[7:14] say for those of you that don't know
[7:18] uh I just wanted to introduce our
[7:20] brother our brother that's been coming
[7:22] with us. Levi's friend if y'all don't
[7:23] know that's brother Hunter Jewel is his
[7:26] name. Brother Hunter, hey, we're glad to
[7:28] have him with us and and we really
[7:31] appreciate him and his testimony and he,
[7:34] you know, him coming and
[7:38] and so we appreciate him and just want
[7:40] him to know he's in our prayers. Amen.
[7:43] You take a stand and the devil's coming
[7:46] after you. Amen. But you know, you got a
[7:49] family here. Amen. That's right.
[7:52] We ain't got nothing to join
[7:55] because you got to be born into the body
[7:56] of Christ.
[7:59] It's you're you're birthed into that.
[8:00] Amen. There's nothing to join. And thank
[8:03] God we know what that is. Amen. To be
[8:06] born again. Amen. Amen.
[8:09] And uh also I want to say um some of you
[8:13] have asked me uh about Dominic Haynes,
[8:17] the the wrestler that broke his neck.
[8:20] Uh Dominic has
[8:23] uh improved. He's still got a long long
[8:25] way to go. He's still in a wheelchair,
[8:27] but he's actually he's
[8:29] had I I think they call it northbound
[8:32] sensations or northbound
[8:35] uh feelings or or uh transmissions.
[8:40] So he can feel pressure, he can feel
[8:42] heat, you know, he can feel cold, those
[8:45] things, but he can't cause his muscles
[8:48] to move, but he can feel things. And
[8:50] they say, "Well, the nerve endings from
[8:52] out come up to his brain." But praise
[8:56] God, the other day they had a video of
[8:57] him flexing one of his biceps.
[9:01] Amen.
[9:03] And so he's I mean he's actually able he
[9:06] was actually a his dad had a video and
[9:08] he was actually tight tightening up his
[9:10] bicep. He could actually control it by
[9:11] himself. And so um he's had a few more
[9:15] muscles. His left I think his left he
[9:17] can flex but his right is hit or miss.
[9:20] And uh but y'all just y'all just
[9:22] continue to pray for him. Uh he's come a
[9:25] long way and he's got a long way to go.
[9:27] Lord willing they're wanting to send him
[9:28] home next month. Amen. So y'all pray for
[9:31] him because his mom and dad, I pray for
[9:33] him all the time because I couldn't
[9:34] imagine trying to take somebody that's
[9:36] in a wheelchair and you're going to be
[9:38] the line share of their care.
[9:42] And if you've ever had to take care of
[9:43] anybody that like that, you know, you
[9:45] can enter in because you know what it's
[9:46] like to have to take care of somebody.
[9:48] But you know, God is moving and I still
[9:51] I still hold him up in prayer and still
[9:52] believe we see a miracle. Yes, sir. I
[9:54] mean, it may take a while, but you know,
[9:57] I still I whether anybody else believes
[9:59] it or not, I believe that. So, I'll just
[10:01] I just stand on my own faith, but u
[10:05] y'all just continue to hold him up. And
[10:07] I just thank God. I know some of you
[10:09] have asked about him. Um he had a he's
[10:12] right now he's fighting he was fighting
[10:14] a fever. He's got a he's got a UTI. So,
[10:17] y'all just continue and somebody that's
[10:18] in a wheelchair in that kind of
[10:20] situation, that's very common for them
[10:21] to have those. and y'all just continue
[10:22] to hold him up. Um, the other thing I
[10:25] want to share with y'all tonight and is
[10:28] this is just a suggestion, but it's that
[10:31] they they've mentioned it. Uh, they've
[10:34] had groups, Sunday school classes,
[10:37] different people. If y'all would like to
[10:38] send cards, letters,
[10:41] anything, then feel free. There's a they
[10:44] they said they he loves getting things.
[10:47] And if so, if y'all feel led to do that,
[10:50] there's a there's a address for you can
[10:52] send stuff to them and just cards,
[10:54] encouragement, whatever. And it's uh you
[10:57] know, it's really nice to get something
[10:59] in the mail to have people know that
[11:02] you're they're thinking
[11:04] of y'all just continue to if y'all feel
[11:07] led to do that or whatever, y'all just
[11:09] and I've got the the address if y'all
[11:12] want to do that. So, um that's all.
[11:15] Let's just all bow our heads before we
[11:16] read the scripture
[11:18] tonight. Heavenly Father, we thank you
[11:20] for this day, Lord. We thank you for all
[11:22] your blessings on us. Lord, we're able
[11:24] to gather in and we just pray that you
[11:26] bless the service tonight, Lord. Help us
[11:27] get out of the way, Lord. We just pray
[11:30] that you just have your will and way
[11:31] with us tonight, minister in a special
[11:34] way to each one. And Father, Lord, for
[11:37] all the needs, we just continue to lift
[11:40] those that have needs, Lord. and many
[11:42] that are sick and afflicted. Lord, many
[11:44] that have many different needs, but
[11:48] Lord, we know that you are the answer to
[11:50] every problem that we have. Every need
[11:52] that we have, you are the answer to it.
[11:55] Father, I just pray
[11:56] that you bless Brother Luis and Sister
[11:59] Christine and and Zoe there.
[12:03] Lord, as they minister in Honduras,
[12:06] Lord, and the ones, Brother Eric,
[12:08] Brother Lee, the different ones, we just
[12:10] pray that you just continue to hold them
[12:11] up, bless them, all the ones that are
[12:14] there in ministry, whatever the next
[12:17] services may be, whatever whatever
[12:19] they're doing. Lord, we just pray that
[12:21] you would just continue to bless them,
[12:22] watch over and keep them. And Lord,
[12:25] we're just so thankful for all your
[12:26] blessings on us. We Lord, we just commit
[12:28] ourselves into into your hands for your
[12:32] honor and glory. Bless the word tonight.
[12:35] We pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
[12:39] Amen. 2
[12:42] Samuel chapter 22 beginning with verse
[12:46] one
[12:47] says, "And David spake unto the Lord the
[12:49] words of this song in the day that the
[12:51] Lord hath delivered him out of the hand
[12:53] of all of his enemies and out of the
[12:54] hand of Saul. And he said, "The Lord is
[12:57] my rock and my fortress and my
[12:59] deliverer. The Lord is my rock. In him
[13:01] will I trust. He is my shield and the
[13:03] horn of my salvation, my high tower, my
[13:06] refuge, my savior. Thou saveest me from
[13:09] violence."
[13:11] And Colossians 1 beginning at verse 16
[13:15] says, "For in him were all things
[13:18] created that are in heaven, that are in
[13:20] earth, visible and invisible, whether
[13:21] they be thrones or dominions or
[13:23] principalities or powers. All things
[13:25] were created by him and for him. And he
[13:28] is before all things, and by him all
[13:30] things consist. And he is the head of
[13:33] the body, the church, who is the
[13:35] beginning, the firstborn from the dead,
[13:37] that in all things he might have the
[13:40] preeminence. Amen. God bless you. You
[13:42] may be seated tonight. And I'm just
[13:44] going to continue my thought. Last time
[13:47] we were talking about the salvation of
[13:49] the
[13:51] Lord. You know, because you
[13:54] can't have
[13:57] salvation without
[13:59] having the
[14:02] Lord. And you know, it takes all of
[14:05] it. And then in the message, proving his
[14:08] word, brother Ram said, he said, "See, a
[14:10] lot of people want Jesus to be their
[14:12] savior, but not their lord. See, Lord is
[14:15] ruler." Yeah. He said, "Jesus, you you
[14:18] save me and let me stand right here, and
[14:20] that's all right, and I'll do my own
[14:22] business. Now, don't get in my business,
[14:25] but you can be my savior, but not my
[14:27] lord." He said, he wants to be lord. You
[14:30] see, then he's your savior. So, he has
[14:33] to be savior and lord.
[14:36] And one of the one of the things I want
[14:38] to look at tonight is, you know, um when
[14:42] when they talk about having salvation,
[14:45] when they talk about
[14:47] uh you know, they they uh many people,
[14:51] certain uh denominations, certain
[14:53] theology, you know, they they believe
[14:55] that it's by faith alone. You all is is
[14:59] faith alone. Well, that's true that you
[15:02] have to have faith alone. But the
[15:03] problem it has to be is it's faith alone
[15:07] in the word. You've got to take the word
[15:10] and all that the word has to say because
[15:12] they say because they try to make a
[15:15] separate belief in that you know he's
[15:18] savior and lord. Well, if you're going
[15:20] to follow the word, you're taking him at
[15:22] his word and that's what makes him your
[15:25] savior. But he has to be all in all. And
[15:29] that's the reason that I wanted I I took
[15:31] the word I wanted to read Colossians 1
[15:34] because it said that he might have the
[15:36] preeminence. So he has to have he has to
[15:39] be the one that's in in in charge, the
[15:42] one that's in
[15:44] control. And so brother Ramon's talking
[15:47] here and he and he talked about you know
[15:50] people people want to be saved but the
[15:52] only reason is they don't want to go to
[15:54] hell but they don't want he said but
[15:56] don't meddle in my affairs. They don't
[15:57] want God controlling everything. But
[15:59] said, he said that Jesus can't have the
[16:01] preeminence. He can't be your Lord
[16:03] because you want him because you want to
[16:05] be your own ruler. But he said he has to
[16:08] rule in your place. He wants to rule in
[16:10] your place as long as you keep the door
[16:12] shut. Though you have accepted him as
[16:15] your personal savior, yet you haven't
[16:16] fully given him preeminence in your
[16:18] life. He said, "Oh churches, isn't that
[16:21] a truth in all the world? They won't let
[16:24] him have lordship. So he has to be
[16:27] savior and lord. And brother Ram said
[16:29] that lord meant ownership.
[16:32] He is the owner. He said just like
[16:34] owning the land, he is the landlord. He
[16:36] owns all of it. And if you accept him,
[16:38] he said they accept gladly accept Jesus
[16:40] as their savior. He said, but they don't
[16:42] want him to be their lord. See, but if
[16:45] you're going to accept one, you have to
[16:47] accept the other because you have to
[16:48] accept all of the word. Whatever the
[16:50] word says is exactly what you have to
[16:52] accept. And he said, 'If you can't take
[16:54] him to be all of it, then you have none
[16:58] of
[16:59] it. Because he said, you know, you have
[17:01] to be you want him to be savior, but you
[17:04] also have to want him to be lord and
[17:06] have rulership and be led and guided by
[17:09] him that he has the preeminence that he
[17:11] is the one in charge that he controls
[17:13] everything. You can't you can't because
[17:16] you can't see what lies ahead. You can't
[17:19] see what has goes in before you. But he
[17:22] does. And if you want to be molded in
[17:25] his image, then he's the one that leads
[17:27] and guides you into all truth to lead
[17:29] you to the place that you need to come
[17:30] to.
[17:32] But brother Brandham says, "What was
[17:34] what is the problem here?" He said, "You
[17:36] know what?" And in the message door
[17:38] inside the door, he said, "You know,
[17:39] what is the problem that we see in the
[17:41] in the last days?" He said, 'Oh, we have
[17:43] a great church and it's all prosperous
[17:45] and we have all these great things, but
[17:47] he said, 'We have weaker pullpits than
[17:48] we've ever had and we have this thing
[17:50] where there's nobody preaching because
[17:52] people, he said, people don't want to
[17:53] surrender themselves to God. And the
[17:56] problem is is the people standing behind
[17:57] the pull pits doesn't preach it that
[18:00] you've got to surrender all your life
[18:01] because you know, if you just want to
[18:03] take part of God, you you're okay with
[18:05] that. Just take whatever you want. It's
[18:07] not a smorgus board. You don't get to
[18:09] pick and choose what you want, but
[18:11] you've got to totally surrender and die
[18:13] out to yourselves. And brother Brandham
[18:15] says, he said, "Though they say I'm
[18:17] saved, I let Jesus save me." Well, that
[18:20] don't that you you don't you don't get
[18:22] to choose whether you get saved or not.
[18:26] You know, if if you're if you're
[18:27] drowning, like I said last time, if
[18:28] you're drowning in the in the in the
[18:30] ocean, you know, you don't get to pick
[18:32] and choose what happens because you're
[18:35] lost and you're not in control. Somebody
[18:37] else is. somebody else has to come in
[18:40] and take control of the situation. And
[18:42] that's the way it is when you're lost
[18:44] and there's a great chasm between you
[18:46] and and God. He comes in and bridges
[18:49] that gap to come to you to pick you up
[18:51] to bring you to the place where you're
[18:52] not in charge. He is
[18:56] and you have to accept him.
[19:00] And he said, and that's the reason he
[19:02] said, I let Jesus say me, but you won't
[19:05] let him be Lord. So he won't stay you
[19:08] with you long. He said that's the reason
[19:10] you go back into the world again. That's
[19:13] exactly right. Why? Because how can two
[19:15] walk together unless they be agreed? You
[19:19] because if you're not sold out to him
[19:21] that he there's no way for him to be in
[19:23] charge and there's no way for you to go
[19:25] because the problem is is if he's not
[19:27] leading you. How do you know to go? What
[19:29] how do you know what truth is? How do
[19:31] you know which way to go if he's not
[19:33] leading you? How do you know what truth
[19:35] is if God didn't tell you what the truth
[19:37] was?
[19:39] It has to be God speaking to your heart
[19:41] to tell you what truth is. Because if
[19:44] not, we would just go by what our own
[19:46] feelings by our own reasoning, our own
[19:48] carnal reason. Well, you know what?
[19:49] That's exactly what Adam and Eve had.
[19:51] They had their own carnal reasonings.
[19:53] And you know what? It ended up in a
[19:54] mess.
[19:57] Every death that's ever happened is
[19:59] because of of Adam and Eve's
[20:01] transgression.
[20:03] every hospital, every crying baby, every
[20:06] problem that we have are the gray hair,
[20:08] our old age, our aches and our pains,
[20:10] all of the faults and failures that we
[20:12] have that we deal with, all of that is
[20:14] because somebody didn't stand true to
[20:16] the word. And brother Brandham said, if
[20:19] if she fell, if they fell on one word
[20:22] for holding to one word, how are you
[20:24] going to get back if you don't believe
[20:25] all of it?
[20:27] Then if you're going to come back, it
[20:29] takes all the word. Man shall not live
[20:32] by bread alone, but by every word that
[20:33] proceedth out of the mouth of God. So,
[20:35] you've got to take everything that God
[20:37] said and hold on it and believe it.
[20:41] Because one of these days, you realize,
[20:42] you know what? I'm not smart enough to
[20:44] save myself. I'm not smart enough to
[20:45] lead myself. I can't figure these things
[20:47] out. I have to have somebody that knows
[20:49] what they're doing.
[20:55] said, he said, "He is the head of the
[20:57] body, the church, who is the beginning,
[21:00] the firstb form from the dead, that is
[21:04] raise up, that he would come to redeem,
[21:06] that in all things he might have the
[21:09] preeminence." He said might have the
[21:11] preeminence. You know what that means?
[21:13] That's over all. He is over all things
[21:15] that was ever created. every angel,
[21:18] every being and everything that there
[21:19] is. He is over all things. What creature
[21:22] is this? Who can it be over all things?
[21:26] So he is the one to have the preeminence
[21:28] that he is the one that is in control.
[21:32] He created all things and by all things
[21:35] by him all things consist.
[21:42] So if we have eternal life, if because
[21:45] that is the goal, the desire that we
[21:48] have is to have eternal life, then you
[21:50] know what it's got to be him leading us
[21:53] and take up residence in us. He's so the
[21:56] only way that he's going to do that as
[21:59] brother Brandham talked about the only
[22:00] way that he will do that is when you
[22:03] allow him to come in. He has you have to
[22:06] open the door and allow him to come in.
[22:09] You know, many people say, "Oh, you
[22:11] know, uh, Lord, we just want to open the
[22:13] door for you and allow you to come in."
[22:15] But they only want, but he said they
[22:17] only want to come to a certain point.
[22:20] They only allow you to come in to a
[22:22] certain, you know, like brother Ram
[22:23] said, you know, you just come in the
[22:24] door and you know, you know, we we let
[22:26] you in, but just stand by the door.
[22:28] Don't come any further. You just stand
[22:30] over there by the door. We don't want
[22:32] you coming any further than that. Well,
[22:34] you know what? That's not being welcome.
[22:37] You know, Brother Brandham said, you
[22:38] know, if if I come to your house and and
[22:40] you said, 'Well, brother Brandham, we
[22:42] love to have you here and you know, just
[22:44] make yourself welcome and you just make
[22:46] yourself comfortable. Then what did he
[22:48] say he would
[22:49] do? I know some people wouldn't like
[22:52] this, but Brother Bram said, you know,
[22:53] if I come to your house and you just
[22:55] said make yourself at home, you know, he
[22:56] said, I'd hang up my hat. He said, I'd
[22:59] go to the refrigerator, I'd swing the
[23:01] door open, get me some baloney and
[23:02] cheese and get some mustard and some
[23:04] onion and everything like that. And he
[23:06] said, "I'd sit down and eat my eat my
[23:08] sandwich." He said, "If you had a soft
[23:10] drink, I'd drink it." And he said, "I
[23:11] just sit back, prop my feet up and enjoy
[23:13] myself." I said, "Why?" Because you said
[23:15] to make yourself welcome.
[23:17] And he said, "That's the exact same way
[23:19] with God. If you want him to be welcome,
[23:22] that he's got to come in and have free
[23:25] reign and have and be comfortable
[23:27] there."
[23:29] But if you but if you don't open the
[23:30] door and allow him to come in and be
[23:32] comfortable, then you know what? then he
[23:34] can't be in that place in your life. He
[23:37] can't be to to the place that he needs
[23:39] to be to lead you because brother said
[23:41] he was a gentleman. So if you don't
[23:43] allow him to have preeminence, if you
[23:45] don't allow him to have rain, he can't
[23:46] do anything for you. And that's the
[23:49] reason why he said because he will not
[23:51] stay with you very long because you will
[23:53] not allow him to do his work. And all of
[23:57] a sudden when he begins to lead you and
[23:59] guide you, hey, you're going to go your
[24:00] own way. Well, guess what? He's gone.
[24:03] He can't lead you any
[24:05] further. But if you allow him because he
[24:08] will speak to you and allow and you
[24:10] allow him to work. When he speaks to
[24:12] you, receptive to what he has to
[24:18] say. See, but you know, you have to take
[24:20] what he says as he leads
[24:23] you. Whatever he says to you, you've got
[24:26] to accept
[24:29] that. Because brother was talking about
[24:34] Cain, you know, here's here's Cain, a
[24:37] great brother said he was a a believer.
[24:38] He's a great religious man. Here he was
[24:40] and he come and God began to speak to
[24:42] him and told him what he needed to do.
[24:46] You know, when when he began because,
[24:48] you know, they both wanted to worship
[24:49] God. They both had to wanted to offer
[24:51] sacrifices and worship God and all these
[24:54] things. But, you know, Cable was Abel
[24:56] was the one that had the revelation of
[24:59] what it took. When God spoke to Abel, he
[25:02] had a revelation that it would take
[25:03] blood that he took a lamb to offer that
[25:06] because that's exactly what what was the
[25:09] sacrifice exactly what was what was
[25:12] needed. And it was actually the
[25:14] revelation of what Jesus would come and
[25:16] do was a type of that showing. That's
[25:18] what it would take because what took
[25:20] place in the garden, it took blood. So
[25:22] the covering had to be blood. So here
[25:25] was here he come back into had to be a
[25:27] bloody lamb that took our place that
[25:29] would cover that would show that that
[25:31] was a type of Christ. But when but when
[25:34] when Cain came in there you know he
[25:36] wanted to offer what he thought was
[25:38] great what was good in his eyes because
[25:41] he had because this is what I had my
[25:43] hand in. This is what I've done. This is
[25:45] what this is this is look at what what I
[25:47] can accomplish. And you know what it has
[25:49] nothing to do with that because God
[25:51] didn't accept any of Cain's revelation.
[25:53] did not accept any of his sacrifice
[25:55] because it was all about him and it had
[25:58] nothing to do with somebody else taking
[26:00] his
[26:02] place. It was, you know, he could build
[26:04] up this great altar and all these
[26:05] things, but it wasn't that it what was
[26:08] what God
[26:09] required. And when God rejected Cain's
[26:12] revelation, when he rejected his
[26:15] sacrifice, God came to Cain and told him
[26:18] exactly what it would take to cover him.
[26:20] He said, "If you want to do right, if
[26:22] you want to do well, then do what your
[26:24] brother done. You don't even have to
[26:26] have a revelation. You just have to have
[26:28] obedience to the word to do what you've
[26:30] seen. That's all it takes."
[26:34] And if you would just take that simple
[26:36] obedience, childlike obedience, and he
[26:38] do that and he turned it down. But it
[26:41] was his choice. It was not God making
[26:43] him do anything. It was Cain's choice to
[26:45] do that.
[26:47] See, see, brother said if it was if if
[26:50] it if God only required you to have
[26:52] faith in him, he said Cain was not
[26:55] infidel. He was a believer. He said if
[26:57] it just took having faith in him, then
[26:59] it then Cain should have been accepted.
[27:02] But it wasn't. But he said because there
[27:04] was
[27:05] a God provided way that there was a way
[27:08] that God had everything to go and there
[27:11] was a way that you were supposed to
[27:13] follow. And that's exactly what he had
[27:15] to do. And God told him what to do. And
[27:17] all he had to do, he didn't have to
[27:19] understand it, but he did have to
[27:21] believe it. He did have to exercise his
[27:23] faith in doing that.
[27:27] But he
[27:28] didn't. And it's the same way. See, if
[27:30] you're going to follow what God has to
[27:32] say, all you got to do is follow what he
[27:34] says.
[27:39] Because it's in the word what was said.
[27:43] When you point out to what was written
[27:44] in the scripture, see, then you hear
[27:46] what the truth is. When you hear these
[27:48] things and see these things, then all
[27:50] you got to do is follow
[27:54] that, you know, because so many people
[27:57] are are very quick when you try to tell
[28:00] them something about the
[28:02] scripture
[28:05] that when it when it comes to the
[28:07] scripture, they're very quick to turn it
[28:10] down or, you know, interject something.
[28:12] But the problem is is like if you see
[28:14] something, if you don't understand
[28:15] something, then go before the Lord and
[28:18] and pray about it and seek God and look
[28:21] for an answer and not and not just say,
[28:24] "Well, you know, I don't I don't see any
[28:25] of that. That's just hogwash or whatever
[28:27] and not even not even follow what said,
[28:30] but go back to the
[28:32] scripture." And then when you take when
[28:34] you look at the scripture because people
[28:36] do not want to settle down and and take
[28:39] what was said and actually look at was
[28:41] said and and take what just like what
[28:44] brother Ram said in one place or what
[28:45] the scripture says, you know, just like
[28:47] Matthew 28:19 and Acts 2. If you don't
[28:50] see how those two are the exact same
[28:52] thing, then you know what? Just take
[28:54] what was said and put it before the Lord
[28:56] and pray and say, "Lord, I don't
[28:57] understand this."
[28:59] Why? Because when people when you when
[29:01] you look at the things that that are in
[29:02] the scripture and you don't understand
[29:04] how this matches with this, you don't
[29:06] understand how these two come together
[29:08] and it's right in the scripture. Well,
[29:09] then don't just well, you know, I just
[29:11] I'm going to take this over here and I'm
[29:13] just going to forget this over here. And
[29:15] you know, when just like brother Tatum
[29:17] always talked about, you know, he didn't
[29:18] want to get to when he got to Acts two
[29:19] or whatever, you know, he just wanted to
[29:21] pass over that because he didn't want to
[29:22] read that because he had questions about
[29:24] it because he couldn't be because he
[29:27] couldn't put them together.
[29:29] And so if you don't understand, well,
[29:31] you know, I I
[29:32] just well, you know, Brother Bam said
[29:35] this over here and and so you know, when
[29:37] well, we're just going don't worry about
[29:39] whatever else he said. You know, it's
[29:42] like the 70 weeks of Daniel. You get to
[29:43] one point, it's like, hey, we're just
[29:44] going we're just going to take this over
[29:46] here and forget about the rest of the
[29:49] book. Well, the problem is is if it's
[29:51] all if it's all thus sayeth the Lord, if
[29:54] he all said it, then guess what? There's
[29:56] somewhere along the way that you can
[29:58] take what he said back here and said
[30:00] what he said over here and put them
[30:01] together
[30:03] because you know what the word will
[30:04] always be in continuity. Now our
[30:07] understanding might not always be in
[30:08] continuity but his word will always be
[30:10] in continuity but the problem is you
[30:12] know what the Holy Ghost will come and
[30:14] speak to you then you know what it'll
[30:15] always dovetail exactly what he said.
[30:20] But a lots of times you find people
[30:21] they'll you know they have questions
[30:23] about something but you know what they
[30:26] that people get to a place and brother
[30:29] Anna was talking about this you know one
[30:30] of the doors in in the heart that he was
[30:32] talking about indoors indoors one of the
[30:34] problems that you see people get to is
[30:36] they have
[30:37] pride he was talking about coming to the
[30:40] door of pride and they never get past
[30:41] that door of pride but the problem is
[30:43] instead of coming out and saying listen
[30:45] I don't understand this I don't
[30:47] understand how this. I don't understand
[30:50] one God. I don't understand how how
[30:52] there's not a trinity because the Bible
[30:53] says everything I've read, everything
[30:55] I've been taught since I was born has
[30:57] been about a trinity. And they don't
[30:58] understand how that's different. Well,
[31:01] you know what? When the Holy Ghost
[31:02] begins to start to lead you, then he'll
[31:04] show you how those things are just it's
[31:06] the same God in operating in a different
[31:09] office. Amen.
[31:13] So then you begin to see how these
[31:14] things are it's the
[31:16] same. It all ties together because
[31:19] everybody says, "Well, the trinitarians,
[31:20] you know, they take they like to run
[31:22] over here and take this scripture and
[31:23] the one just like to take this scripture
[31:25] over here and they just like
[31:28] to or you know, everybody's like, well,
[31:30] you know, I'm I'm
[31:33] uh you know, I'm I'm all I'm all about
[31:36] the predestination. you know, Calvinist
[31:38] and you got Armenianism and everybody
[31:40] arguing over the same thing and not
[31:42] realizing all of it's in Brother Ram
[31:43] said, "I'm a Calvinist as long as it's
[31:45] in the Bible." He said, "I'm Armenian as
[31:47] long as it's in the
[31:48] Bible." Because what? There's a there's
[31:50] a place where it all begins to dovetail
[31:52] together.
[31:54] Because people, you talk about people
[31:56] understanding, well, I just believe, I
[31:58] just believe in free will and not
[31:59] understanding that God can predestinate
[32:02] by his fornowledge, knowing what your
[32:04] choice would be. Understanding what the
[32:07] election of God is, how it all ties
[32:09] together. It when you when God begins to
[32:11] speak to you and tell you how it all
[32:13] it's very simple. Brother said, even a
[32:16] child could understand it. Even the most
[32:19] illiterate person could understand it.
[32:21] But what does it take? It takes a Holy
[32:23] Ghost revelation. It takes a Holy Ghost
[32:25] speaking to you and he'll show you these
[32:27] things.
[32:30] If we if we if we hold on to what the
[32:33] Holy Ghost said, if we will just be led
[32:35] by him,
[32:38] he said, "How be it when he the spirit
[32:40] of truth is come," he said, "he will
[32:42] lead you and guide you into all truth."
[32:44] Well, then all you got to do is continue
[32:46] to follow that and he will lead you and
[32:48] guide you into all truth and he will
[32:50] begin to show you these things. Then
[32:53] it'll begin to open up and you'll see
[32:55] these things how perfectly they fit
[33:01] together. But like brother said, see if
[33:04] you don't believe all the
[33:07] word. See, you have not received the
[33:09] Holy Ghost.
[33:15] Because people, well, you know, I'm just
[33:16] gonna I'm just going to pick pick my my
[33:18] this over here. I'm gonna take that over
[33:20] there. You know what? I I believe it all
[33:21] whether I whether I understand it or
[33:23] not. It's the scripture. But you know,
[33:26] the one thing is I'm not turning down
[33:27] anything. I'm gonna hold on to it
[33:30] because you know what? I've had
[33:31] questions in my life that I've held on
[33:33] for years and not understand it. But you
[33:35] know what? I didn't. Brother Ram said
[33:36] this one over here. He said that over
[33:38] there. I don't understand how that ties
[33:40] together. It don't make any sense to me.
[33:42] I'm more confused than if I was trying
[33:44] to study Chinese algebra. But the
[33:46] problem is is when the Holy Ghost comes
[33:48] and begins to speak to you, then it'll
[33:50] all it'll come and dovetail and you'll
[33:52] see it exactly clearly that you
[33:54] understand what what took place. It's
[33:56] exactly perfect. All you got to do is
[33:58] trust him that he will lead you that
[34:01] way.
[34:07] But see, if we don't if we don't allow
[34:09] him to be lord of our life, if we don't
[34:11] allow him to take up pre and say Lord,
[34:14] because as we study in the word, because
[34:16] if you want to be like God, if you want
[34:17] to be closer to Christ, what he say do?
[34:20] He said, you got to read your Bible and
[34:21] pray. You got to get into the word, you
[34:23] got to get in and study this thing and
[34:25] not talk about it just every once in a
[34:27] while. And you know, you
[34:30] know, you know, you see these people and
[34:33] I'm I'm gonna say it again and um that's
[34:38] okay. But you know, like you know, like
[34:40] some people say the only Bible reading
[34:42] they get done in a whole day is some
[34:44] people somebody like brother Donnie,
[34:45] they'll send that little quote out and
[34:46] they'll they'll send a little scripture,
[34:48] you know, one scripture and they read
[34:50] that one scripture. Well, I done my
[34:51] scripture reading for the
[34:54] day. But you know what? They'll spend
[34:56] seven hours on
[34:57] Facebook. They'll get on
[34:59] Instagram. You know, they'll be in
[35:01] everything else reading and all these
[35:04] other things. And, you know,
[35:06] uh whatever else, you know, people
[35:08] people spend hours and hours watching
[35:10] Tik Tok and and when they get done, they
[35:12] they got nothing accomplished.
[35:16] I mean, at least if you watch something
[35:17] and try to learn something. I mean, you
[35:19] know, I I I try to tell Levi all the
[35:22] time, you know, try to teach him about
[35:24] heating and air, try to teach about air
[35:25] conditioning. It's like, listen, they
[35:27] got you can learn a lot on on YouTube.
[35:29] If you watch some videos, you might
[35:30] learn
[35:31] something or you can work on you can
[35:34] learn how to work on engines and all
[35:35] kinds of things. Lots of people answer a
[35:37] lot of questions on there. And people,
[35:40] you know, some people they they just
[35:41] they just feed on that all day long.
[35:43] Just suck it up YouTube. Suck it up,
[35:45] YouTube. And the problem is it's like,
[35:46] you know what? If you want to meet the
[35:48] creator of heaven and earth, if you want
[35:50] to meet the God that come by and spoke
[35:52] to you, that created all things and and
[35:55] brought you to the place that you are
[35:57] today and give you everything that you
[35:59] have today and wants to wants to come in
[36:02] and take up resonance in you and fill
[36:04] you with the Holy Ghost and lead and
[36:06] guide you and take you to a place that
[36:08] you can't even think of, imagine in your
[36:11] mind what that place, how great that
[36:12] place is going to be. and he wants to
[36:14] come and and have resonance with you,
[36:16] have fellowship with you every single
[36:18] day. And people, well, I
[36:21] don't I mean, you might as well be
[36:23] talking to the
[36:24] wall and not realize how great God is
[36:27] because he was so great that he
[36:29] condescended to come to such a simple,
[36:32] humble, lowly birth to come and dwell
[36:35] with us to take up flesh
[36:38] that he became what we are that we might
[36:40] become what he is.
[36:43] that he would come and take up and and
[36:45] take our sin who knew no sin. He became
[36:48] our sin that we can become the
[36:51] righteousness of God. Become the
[36:54] righteousness of God.
[36:57] That's what God wants us to realize.
[37:04] You know, it's amazing.
[37:06] I've I've been to Fort Knox one time in
[37:08] my life, but you know, you you drive by
[37:10] there and you I've been on the army base
[37:13] there at Fort Knox and you see the the
[37:15] great big building there there and they
[37:16] say, "Well, that's where all the gold is
[37:17] over there. They got all the security
[37:19] fences and everything." You see this
[37:21] great big place, there's nothing around
[37:22] it. You know, it's got all this grass
[37:24] and it's just, you know, they see you
[37:26] coming from a half a mile or
[37:29] more, but you know, everybody talks
[37:31] about, man, you know what? I'd love to
[37:32] be in Fort
[37:35] Knox. People would people would just
[37:37] love to open their eyes and look into a
[37:40] place where they could see that much
[37:43] gold. Just see stacks and I mean I don't
[37:47] have tons and tons of
[37:50] gold, man. You people, boy, I wish could
[37:54] you imagine what it'd be like to just
[37:55] have a part of
[37:56] that. Would you what would what would it
[37:59] be if you could just take one of them
[38:00] gold bars home with
[38:03] you? Man, you know that that'd be
[38:05] something if I had just one gold
[38:08] bar and you know they just pack it
[38:11] around. Look at what I
[38:15] got. I got my gold bar. Look at that. I
[38:19] got something in the rest of y'all. God,
[38:20] look at this gold
[38:22] bar. Look how great it
[38:25] is. and not realizing we got something
[38:28] much greater than that.
[38:33] When you realize you come in the house
[38:35] of
[38:35] God, the greatest thing that God could
[38:38] give
[38:39] you, you can tote it around on your
[38:42] phone. You can tote it
[38:48] around. And you know, it's like, well,
[38:51] there's the Bible.
[38:53] But you know, if you realize how
[38:55] precious it
[38:58] was, there's people around the world
[39:01] that have died just to have one page of
[39:04] this, just one sheet of
[39:07] it. I mean, they gave up their lives.
[39:10] They can go to prison. They can die just
[39:12] because it's illegal to have
[39:16] this. We got it on computer. We got it
[39:19] on laptop. We've got all these things.
[39:21] And then, you know, they don't even have
[39:24] what we have. We've have we've got we've
[39:26] got all of the prophets message.
[39:28] Everything that's been given to us that
[39:30] we've received, we have this. We can we
[39:32] can have it in in all kinds of forms.
[39:34] You can stream it. You can you can
[39:36] listen to it anywhere.
[39:41] I mean, and all the different formats
[39:43] that you can have. You can listen to the
[39:44] message, you can read it, you can have
[39:46] everything. It's translated in other
[39:49] languages. It's a great thing. You can
[39:51] just pull it out and you can search up
[39:52] any kind of word. You can you can find
[39:54] every time brother Brandham said
[39:56] something. Every time he mentions one
[39:58] word, you can find it. Every time one
[40:00] little phrase, you can you can search it
[40:01] all the way through the scripture. You
[40:02] can read every time brother Brandham
[40:03] said that. You can sit down. You look at
[40:06] it one scripture or one word in the
[40:08] Bible. You can find it every time it's
[40:09] been
[40:11] mentioned. And it's like, man, look at
[40:13] look at all this. Oh man, it's it's so
[40:14] great.
[40:17] And yet we don't value the time that
[40:20] God's given
[40:23] us. And you know, you know how when you
[40:27] have something that's
[40:29] valuable, you
[40:32] know, I I don't know, I don't know about
[40:34] you, but everywhere I
[40:36] go, my truck ain't the greatest, but you
[40:40] know, everywhere I go, I lock my
[40:42] truck. I lock the house
[40:45] up. I go to work, I lock all my tools
[40:49] up because I have because it means
[40:52] something to
[40:54] me that that you you know and because
[40:57] you know why because somebody will try
[40:58] to take it away from
[41:01] you and you just turn your back and it's
[41:03] gone and you know what and the devil is
[41:05] there and that's what his whole goal is
[41:07] is to take this away from you to take
[41:09] away your time that you can fellowship
[41:11] with God that you can get closer to God
[41:13] to get what you have need of you have
[41:16] the opportunity, but we don't take the
[41:17] time to do
[41:22] it. If we if we actually, you know,
[41:25] because if we
[41:27] actually and I was thinking about this
[41:29] the other day, you know, if if I
[41:31] actually and I'm just going to tell on
[41:33] myself, I'm just going to preach, you
[41:34] know, y'all say amen or what, but you
[41:37] know, you know, if you know, I have
[41:39] questions about something. I I'm working
[41:40] on a working on an air conditioning unit
[41:42] and you know there's a problem and I
[41:44] don't I can't figure it out. You know
[41:46] I'm looking at this. I'm looking at
[41:47] that. Well, you know what? I just don't
[41:49] say,
[41:50] "Well, I can't figure it
[41:54] out." Because you know what? There's
[41:56] nobody else that's going to come
[42:01] by. And you know, I just can't say,
[42:04] "Well,
[42:05] hey, call somebody. Let them let them
[42:08] work on I don't know.
[42:11] But you know what? Sometimes there's
[42:13] something down inside of you. He's like,
[42:14] I want to find out what this problem is.
[42:17] I'm gonna fix I'm gonna figure this
[42:18] thing out. And there's something that
[42:20] drives you and you dig and you dig and
[42:23] you know after a while you figure out
[42:24] what the problem is. Like, oh man, that
[42:26] was so easy. But sometimes it's things
[42:28] that you overlook.
[42:32] But it's so simple. It lays right there
[42:33] in front of you. But you know, then all
[42:35] of a sudden it kept, well, that was so
[42:37] easy. Well, the next time you have that
[42:39] problem, then it's so much easier
[42:40] because you know, I've already done I've
[42:42] already I already thought this
[42:44] through. But the problem is is do we do
[42:46] the same thing in the scripture? Because
[42:48] if you had a question about something
[42:49] that it's like, do you stay there? Do
[42:51] you continually seek God about an
[42:54] answer? It's like, well, I'm just going
[42:55] to put it on the
[42:57] shelf and we just forget about it. Just
[42:59] put it in the back of my
[43:02] mind. No, I had I've had questions in my
[43:05] mind. And I knew that somewhere along
[43:07] the way, God would answer my question.
[43:09] But, you know, I never forgot that. It
[43:11] always stayed. I always prayed about
[43:13] those things. I kept, you know, like and
[43:15] it and it was
[43:19] years, you know. I was I was there the
[43:21] first time I heard somebody preach that
[43:22] that Jesus wasn't God until the River
[43:24] Jordan. When I the first time I ever
[43:26] heard that, and I've told you that
[43:29] before, I told the Lord, I said, "If
[43:31] that's true, you have to reveal that to
[43:32] me because I don't make any sense.
[43:36] It didn't make I mean it's like well and
[43:38] and here they are they're reading quotes
[43:39] of brother Brandham and here they're
[43:41] talking they're reading listen to this
[43:42] and this and they just kept going on.
[43:44] It's
[43:46] like
[43:47] no it don't don't I was like I don't if
[43:52] it's true I don't want it's like well
[43:54] Lord you'll have to show that because it
[43:55] don't make sense to
[43:59] me. I wish it
[44:01] did, but it but I just don't understand
[44:05] how that takes
[44:07] place. And you know it was and you you
[44:10] see these things and you hold on to them
[44:11] for years and you don't understand. It's
[44:13] like, well, you know, and you know, I
[44:15] wasn't ashamed to tell people I don't
[44:17] understand
[44:19] that. He goes, you know what? Because
[44:22] the one thing
[44:24] is Satan, the one thing that you can do
[44:27] against Satan is expose Satan.
[44:33] Because when people have a problem and
[44:36] they have issues, see that because that
[44:38] pride raises up and it's like, well, I
[44:40] don't want anybody to make fun of me
[44:42] that that I didn't understand that. I
[44:43] didn't see that. Well, you know what? I
[44:45] don't care.
[44:49] Would you rather be free? Would you
[44:51] rather know the truth? When people come
[44:54] along, you know, when when people
[44:57] realize that, you know, they can get rid
[44:59] of Satan.
[45:01] When Satan has a hold of
[45:04] you because the first thing you do is
[45:07] when you don't understand something, it
[45:09] brings fear,
[45:11] it brings confusion.
[45:13] And God is not the author of confusion.
[45:15] God is not the author of fear. So the
[45:18] first thing that he's going to do is
[45:19] he's going to say, "Well, you know, you
[45:21] better not say
[45:24] nothing." What do you do? You say,
[45:26] "Well, I don't know, but I'm gonna find
[45:28] somebody that knows the truth.
[45:31] Could you could you imagine the
[45:34] Ethiopian unic out there reading the
[45:37] scripture? He's reading the scripture
[45:39] out there and it's like, well, he didn't
[45:41] understand any of that, you know, he
[45:42] just going along and here God
[45:45] supernaturally sends Philillip his way
[45:47] and you know he's sitting there and he's
[45:48] like, well, how you doing,
[45:51] brother? And just talk about the weather
[45:53] or whatever.
[45:57] No, he said he sent Philillip along his
[45:59] way to answer his question. And that's
[46:01] exactly what the Ethiopian unic done. As
[46:03] soon as as soon as Philip showed up, he
[46:05] said, "Do you understand what you're
[46:06] reading?" He said, "No." He said, "Who
[46:08] is he speaking of?" So, what's the first
[46:10] thing that Philip does? He takes the
[46:12] scripture and he begins to unfold the
[46:15] scripture to the Ethiopian unic for him
[46:17] to understand who Jesus Christ was to
[46:19] understand what the scripture was
[46:21] speaking of the prophecy and showing him
[46:23] the day the present day truth
[46:26] and he began to show him the scripture
[46:28] of what the present day truth was where
[46:30] he was standing and when he began to
[46:32] understand because somebody had the
[46:34] truth and began to speak to him the
[46:36] truth he said here's water what hinderth
[46:38] us and went right to the daughter.
[46:43] And it's the same way with you and I if
[46:45] we just follow that same simple pattern
[46:47] because we don't have because we may not
[46:50] had somebody supernaturally show up. I
[46:52] didn't get here tonight, church
[46:54] supernaturally.
[46:56] I didn't make it
[46:58] supernaturally. But you know what? I
[47:00] believe that when we come to the house
[47:01] of God, if you're prayed up and I'm
[47:03] prayed up and the preachers prayed up,
[47:05] then let me tell you something. Then
[47:06] supernaturally we hear from God and but
[47:08] God begins to speak to you where you sit
[47:10] and answer your questions and give you
[47:12] what you have need of.
[47:19] But sometimes we fail to realize where
[47:21] we're standing at when we stand here in
[47:24] the house of God realizing we're
[47:26] supernaturally hearing from God.
[47:31] It's not because it's not what's in our
[47:33] notes. It's not what we've
[47:38] studied. You know, I I wish sometimes
[47:40] that I could just say, "Boy, this is all
[47:42] me. I come up with all
[47:45] this." Sometimes, you know, I get up
[47:48] here and preach and everybody says,
[47:49] "Boy, that was so good." It's like,
[47:50] "Yeah, I know it was good cuz, man, I
[47:52] just just heard this."
[47:56] Everything's we sat right on and read
[47:58] all this stuff and write it all down and
[47:59] we got no because when the Holy Spirit
[48:02] becomes to speak through us, we're just
[48:04] the conduit for him to speak.
[48:07] How many times has somebody come the
[48:09] brothers would tell you somebody's come
[48:11] up and ask you a question, you don't
[48:12] know what to tell them. You stand there
[48:15] just as blank as you can
[48:17] be. Somebody ask you a question about
[48:20] something, you stand there look at
[48:22] them. No, we just walk around. The Lord
[48:25] just speaks to us all the time. We just
[48:27] we're just so standing in the in the
[48:29] presence of the Lord all the time and we
[48:31] just we just bask in it all the time.
[48:37] No, we come we we we study for a message
[48:40] and you know what
[48:44] it I mean it's a grind.
[48:48] I wish I wish it was I wish it was just
[48:50] like laying back on the beach, you know?
[48:53] You just just laying back on the couch
[48:55] with your heads beh like and the Lord
[48:58] just gives you
[49:01] everything. How many ask the brothers
[49:03] how many how many sermons have you
[49:05] started that you hadn't
[49:09] finished? How many you got, brother Bob?
[49:12] How many you got? Innumerable. You
[49:15] start, you get a message, you start one
[49:17] and you get you get a few scriptures.
[49:19] You get this or that. You write it down.
[49:21] It'll sit in your log. It'll sit on your
[49:23] computer for months, for years.
[49:27] It'll start to get mothballs. I mean,
[49:30] there's a mo I mean, it's just so old.
[49:32] You got to knock the dust off of it when
[49:34] you pull it
[49:36] up and you said, and you and but you
[49:38] know, you you look at something and it's
[49:40] like, and I wish, and I I I speak from
[49:43] my heart. I wish I was like one of these
[49:45] other brothers, you know, because you
[49:47] you look at brother Wayade and Brother
[49:48] Dale, they could preach a sermon and I
[49:50] mean, they could preach preach one a
[49:52] series and preach it for months and
[49:54] years. I ain't made like that. That
[49:57] ain't me. But the thing is, I have to
[50:00] realize who I am, the calling that's in
[50:02] my life, and what God wants me to do.
[50:04] And I've got to operate in that way. I
[50:07] can't operate like everybody else. But
[50:10] you know what? But they, you know, they
[50:11] would say, you know, you don't you can't
[50:13] be like me and I can't be like them. And
[50:17] they'd probably say, "You don't want to
[50:18] be like
[50:19] me. You be you."
[50:23] But see, you know, everybody has their
[50:25] own calling. Everybody has their own
[50:27] personality, the way that God uses them.
[50:29] But you you've got to stay in your your
[50:32] uh office that God's given you. Amen.
[50:36] and let God speak to you through that he
[50:38] you can speak to the
[50:40] people and it's so wonderful, you know,
[50:42] when you sit down and you begin to pray
[50:44] and I mean everything just starts just
[50:46] falling and you I you know I've had the
[50:49] Holy Spirit just drop in the room and
[50:50] man I'm writing so fast I can't even I
[50:52] can't even write everything down trying
[50:54] to remember what the Lord said when
[50:56] you're
[50:59] just you ever had that Bob tell you what
[51:03] you you get up and man you feel like you
[51:05] don't your feet Don't even touch the
[51:06] floor. It's so
[51:09] great, man. I tell you what, it's
[51:11] wonderful to be like that. And I wish I
[51:13] wish it was like that all the time, but
[51:15] it's
[51:16] not. You get in there and go, "Man,
[51:18] that's so good." But you know, the first
[51:20] thing that you do, you you begin to
[51:22] preach a message like that and you know
[51:24] it comes straight from the throne of
[51:25] God. And you begin to speak and let me
[51:27] tell you what, the devil will be all
[51:29] over you. The devil will hinder you.
[51:31] Everything will go wrong.
[51:35] He'll fight you. Just like brother R
[51:37] when he was studying for the message uh
[51:38] recognizing your day in this message. He
[51:40] said I felt like the Lord was trying to
[51:42] speak to me. I felt like the Lord was
[51:43] trying to speak to me. And he said you
[51:45] know he said I got sick. You know I was
[51:46] in the basement trying to read. I fell
[51:48] asleep. You know all these things. He
[51:50] said you know I just kept but I had to
[51:51] stay with it. Just staying with it. Just
[51:54] stay there and just constantly pray and
[51:56] seeking the Lord. And he said, "Finally,
[51:57] the Lord was, you know, at a certain
[51:59] time there late at night, early in the
[52:01] morning, whatever it was, but you know,
[52:02] it broke through." And he said, "The
[52:03] Lord was able to give me this message."
[52:05] Why? Because Satan wants to hinder you.
[52:08] But you've got to stay and fight.
[52:11] Just stay right there.
[52:16] And if you just yield yourselves and God
[52:18] can
[52:21] speak. See, if we just open up our
[52:24] hearts and allow him in, let him be
[52:27] welcome. Then he begins to speak to
[52:30] us. Then when he begins to speak to us,
[52:34] it will lead us to the place where we
[52:36] need to be.
[52:41] And you
[52:42] know when you when you go through these
[52:44] things
[52:46] and there there's many times in your
[52:48] life you face these things and you you
[52:50] go through things like brother Bram said
[52:52] talking about that pride in your heart.
[52:54] They said well what does God have to do
[52:56] to
[52:57] you? Brother Bram said he'll humiliate
[53:00] you. He'll break you down because of
[53:04] that pride.
[53:06] And just like a sheep before the shears,
[53:09] everything has to be done. Has to take
[53:12] you through a certain path. It's like,
[53:14] well, I don't want to go through that.
[53:16] Well, you know what? But Jesus didn't
[53:18] want to have to go through what he had
[53:19] to go
[53:21] through. Here we are. You know, Sunday
[53:24] will be Easter. Here's
[53:28] Jesus knowing what was going to take
[53:30] place, knowing what lay
[53:34] ahead and stood there and said, "Lord,
[53:38] if it if it's not if it can, let this
[53:40] cup pass from
[53:41] me, but not my will, but thine be
[53:45] done." Sitting there and and you know,
[53:48] he struggled with
[53:49] that knowing this is what he came into
[53:52] the earth to do. This is this is what he
[53:55] was called to
[53:57] do. And many times in our lives, we fa
[53:59] we face the same things. We go through
[54:01] the same things that in our lives just
[54:04] like that. We have these things happen
[54:05] in our lives and we wonder why. It's
[54:07] like, oh, I don't I don't want to
[54:08] understand why we had to go through
[54:10] this. I don't understand why I had to go
[54:11] through this. I don't understand this. I
[54:13] don't understand it. Because God is
[54:14] molding your character. Because God is
[54:17] showing you something. God is bringing
[54:19] you to a place. I don't want to have to
[54:22] go through these things. But just like,
[54:23] you know, brother random was standing
[54:25] there that day and he stood there and he
[54:26] said, he said, you know, you took Lord,
[54:29] you took my wife and you took my
[54:31] daughter. You know, talking about being
[54:33] sheared and he said, Lord, she cheer me
[54:35] again. Whatever has to be done, I want
[54:38] that to happen to me. I want you to be
[54:42] the Lord of my life. I want you to have
[54:44] the preeminence in my life. I want you
[54:47] to be in charge. Whatever happens in
[54:49] this world, I want you to be in charge.
[54:52] I want you to lead me in all of these
[54:57] things because he said, "How can two
[55:00] walk together unless they be
[55:02] agreed?" So, you have to agree with him.
[55:04] Whatever he says, you got to agree with
[55:06] it. Say amen to the word. So, I don't I
[55:10] don't understand these things, but I
[55:12] want to have the leading of the Lord.
[55:21] and many things in in the
[55:24] scripture. We're not try to get through
[55:27] some of this, but you know, you look and
[55:29] see in the hour in the day in which we
[55:31] live. See, God has called
[55:34] us to have not not just God having the
[55:39] leadership, but he's also given man
[55:42] leadership.
[55:44] So when you see, you know, it's like if
[55:47] you have confidence in God, I have
[55:49] confidence in God in one thing that if
[55:51] God is leading me and and God is wanting
[55:53] to lead me and he's wanting to give me
[55:55] the best that he has and he wants me to
[55:57] see these things, then I understand
[55:59] there's one thing that's got to take
[56:01] place. I've got to have a
[56:04] pastor because God is going to lead you.
[56:06] Well, how is he going to lead? Is
[56:08] because he's going to have men to do
[56:10] that.
[56:12] Then what is it? Then what does it take?
[56:14] Then when you see God is leading me,
[56:16] then what else is he going to lead?
[56:17] Because if God is lead if God's brought
[56:19] me this far, then you know what? Because
[56:21] of what the scripture
[56:23] says, then guess what? We've got to have
[56:25] a pastor. And guess what? There's going
[56:28] to be five there's going to be a
[56:29] five-fold ministry that's come to bring
[56:31] the word and they're going to speak and
[56:34] that what they speak is going to be the
[56:35] truth.
[56:37] Because you know what? God if God was
[56:40] able to speak through men in the
[56:43] past from the beginning all the prophets
[56:46] and and everything that was spoken of
[56:49] came through came by the Holy Spirit
[56:51] speak working through me and to speak
[56:53] it's like well you know what it's done
[56:56] now it's
[56:59] done just like just like when you go to
[57:01] the Baptist like you know what God don't
[57:03] speak anymore because he wrote it all in
[57:05] the Bible he he spoke the Bible you know
[57:07] what Well, you know what? Then how then
[57:09] how did he call
[57:12] you? If that's true, then how did he
[57:14] call
[57:15] you? Oh, well, the Bible says,
[57:18] "Whosoever it ain't your
[57:21] name." You're starting to read into the
[57:23] scripture, aren't
[57:27] you? Like, well, I can I can only become
[57:29] a Christian if I if I scroll through the
[57:31] Bible and find a place where it says
[57:33] Aaron
[57:34] Roberts. No.
[57:37] but is but is spoken that this this is
[57:40] what would take place.
[57:43] So when he under when you understand
[57:45] that God can speak anytime he wants to
[57:47] because he spokes to people and they say
[57:49] well you know he doesn't have prophets
[57:51] anymore and he doesn't have this where
[57:52] where does that where's the scripture
[57:54] says that he took those took it out of
[57:55] the Bible
[57:58] because because if he speaks to you then
[58:00] guess what he can speak through man and
[58:02] just like just like he did in the past
[58:06] because if he because he speaks to you
[58:09] he called you
[58:11] well is that God, is that God not
[58:13] speaking?
[58:15] Well, if it if it's the same God that
[58:17] spoke to you and called you out of the
[58:19] ditch somewhere, out of the miry clay,
[58:21] out of the pits of hell, if he called
[58:24] you up out of that, then you know what?
[58:25] He still if it's the same God that it's
[58:27] the same one, then he can call a prophet
[58:31] that can they can speak the word and
[58:33] speak just like he did in the
[58:35] scripture. It's like, well, you know,
[58:38] well, you know, he's he's done he's done
[58:39] with this part of it. No, because guess
[58:43] what? It's like when you go into the
[58:45] scripture and you begin to
[58:47] look Malachi 4, Luke
[58:51] 17, the scriptures, where where where
[58:54] does that fall into place? when you
[58:56] understand what's going to have to take
[58:59] place. When Jesus stood there talking to
[59:02] the disciples and he told them, he said,
[59:03] "Listen," he said, "Elijah truly shall
[59:06] come and restore all things, but I say
[59:09] to you that he's already come and you
[59:12] didn't know
[59:14] him." When the scripture tells us that
[59:16] he said he would turn the hearts of the
[59:18] children to the fathers and the fathers
[59:20] to the
[59:22] children. When it when it when it reads
[59:25] in the scripture when it says that when
[59:27] it tells us that there was a time that
[59:28] he's got to turn the hearts of the
[59:30] children back to the
[59:33] fathers. That wasn't that wasn't
[59:35] fulfilled in in John's
[59:37] day. But it's plain as day because it's
[59:39] what the scripture
[59:41] says. Anybody with one eye and half
[59:44] sense, if you've got any if you've got
[59:47] any basic understanding of
[59:51] English, because you know what? If you
[59:53] took that into a court of law, if you
[59:55] went into a court of law and you took
[59:56] that up and and brought that up, you
[59:58] know what? They would they could turn
[59:59] you down and say, "Well, you know what?
[1:00:00] That's not what the Bible says. If it's
[1:00:02] not written in the contract, you know
[1:00:04] what? It's not
[1:00:09] enforceable because the contract doesn't
[1:00:11] say both
[1:00:15] parts. So if if that was a if that was a
[1:00:18] contract that was written because it
[1:00:19] doesn't list both parts, then John
[1:00:21] couldn't be the fulfillment of that.
[1:00:25] Then it has to be somebody else. You
[1:00:27] tell me who it is.
[1:00:30] You tell me where it's at.
[1:00:34] People spend all their time trying to
[1:00:36] tear down this message. Well, you know
[1:00:37] what? It it don't it don't bother me
[1:00:39] that people try to tear down this
[1:00:41] message because you know what? It's not
[1:00:42] to the whole world. The whole world's
[1:00:45] not been called to
[1:00:47] this. But and if nobody else is called
[1:00:50] to it, I've been called to it. It's
[1:00:53] called It's called to me.
[1:00:56] And I responded.
[1:01:00] See, we have to understand the day and
[1:01:02] hour in which we live and what God has
[1:01:04] called us to to understand that God has
[1:01:06] placed man over us and God speaks
[1:01:10] through
[1:01:11] man because he done it in the past. And
[1:01:14] guess what? If he if he leads and guides
[1:01:16] us and he's the one that's calling and
[1:01:18] it's and it's the Holy Spirit working,
[1:01:19] you're telling me that he can't that he
[1:01:21] can't speak through man
[1:01:26] again? Then it's like, well, I I don't
[1:01:29] have very good confidence in
[1:01:32] God. Well, God can do anything he wants
[1:01:35] to. Whatever God wants to do, he's big
[1:01:39] enough. He's strong enough. He's
[1:01:41] powerful enough to do whatever he wants
[1:01:43] to, but he can't speak through a
[1:01:49] prophet. God knows all things. God knows
[1:01:53] all things. He knows. He knows our up
[1:01:55] are getting up and are going to bed. He
[1:01:57] knows
[1:01:58] everything. But he didn't have
[1:02:01] predestination. He couldn't
[1:02:02] predestinate. He couldn't know ahead of
[1:02:04] time what was going to take
[1:02:07] place. How ridiculous does that
[1:02:11] sound? He knew the beginning. He knew
[1:02:13] the end from the beginning. He knew
[1:02:14] everything was going to take place. And
[1:02:15] if you got confidence in God, then you
[1:02:17] realize that he can speak through your
[1:02:18] brother with all his faults and vagues
[1:02:20] and all of his problems and everything.
[1:02:22] But you got to look past the veil and
[1:02:24] see that it's the Holy Spirit speaking
[1:02:25] to somebody. Speaking through a man when
[1:02:29] it's God on the inside
[1:02:33] speaking. See all of these things
[1:02:35] through the scripture. Realize it takes
[1:02:37] man. It's
[1:02:41] leadership. And it's a and you know and
[1:02:44] a true man of God, a true man that's a
[1:02:47] that's in a leadership position, you
[1:02:49] know what? He ain't walking around
[1:02:54] going. Look at
[1:03:00] me. Because you know what? When Jesus
[1:03:03] came to the earth, he didn't walk
[1:03:06] around living that kind of life.
[1:03:10] He came
[1:03:11] humble, the humble, meekst man there was
[1:03:15] to come that way to give be be our
[1:03:20] example. And when people saw brother
[1:03:23] Brandham and the and the ministry and
[1:03:24] the life that he lived, people said we
[1:03:28] saw Jesus
[1:03:29] Christ. I've never met a more humble man
[1:03:32] in my
[1:03:33] life. And see, you know what? If you're
[1:03:36] if you're in a place of leadership, then
[1:03:37] you know what? You're not puffing. You
[1:03:39] don't it don't puff you up. It don't
[1:03:42] make you
[1:03:43] big. Because you know the thing is is
[1:03:45] when you come to that place, you realize
[1:03:47] that everything that you say, you'll
[1:03:48] give an account for. Everything that you
[1:03:51] do, you'll give an account
[1:03:54] for. Just like just like when brother
[1:03:56] Rand was talking about the family. And
[1:03:59] as the scripture talks about every as
[1:04:02] Paul said, every head of every
[1:04:06] man is
[1:04:08] Christ. And he said, "And the and the
[1:04:11] man is the head of the
[1:04:14] woman." And so then you see there's
[1:04:17] headship there. And everybody's like,
[1:04:18] "Well, you know, I just like the
[1:04:25] I like to have my wife under my
[1:04:28] foot. Well, you know what? How is How is
[1:04:32] that? How is that the the a son of God?
[1:04:34] How is that the leadership of the Holy
[1:04:36] Spirit? How how is
[1:04:39] that? Because you know what? God didn't
[1:04:41] do you that way. Then how do you do how
[1:04:43] do husbands have the thing right they
[1:04:45] think they can do their wives that
[1:04:47] way? If God didn't do you that way, then
[1:04:50] how is it that that pastors treat their
[1:04:53] congregations that
[1:04:57] way? Because you can't do you can't do
[1:04:59] that because it's not the leadership.
[1:05:01] It's not the leading Holy Spirit. It's
[1:05:03] not the spirit of God that'll do that
[1:05:05] because you understand the condition and
[1:05:07] the and the awesome position, the
[1:05:09] responsibility that you
[1:05:16] have. Just like in the in the and when
[1:05:20] you understand
[1:05:24] the because you see these people and
[1:05:29] and I I I I understand that there's a
[1:05:33] lot of preachers and there's been a lot
[1:05:34] of pastors that's done a lot of things
[1:05:36] and you know what they they deserve a
[1:05:38] lot of things that they get. But you
[1:05:40] know there there's certain people
[1:05:41] they've gotten to the point in their
[1:05:43] life where you know we don't need
[1:05:45] this and everything and it's like you
[1:05:48] know what they don't realize this is God
[1:05:50] speaking to this is God's gift to
[1:05:53] you don't realize what God's given
[1:05:57] you. It's because this is this is God's
[1:06:00] leadership for you. It's God speaking to
[1:06:06] you when you when so when you see this
[1:06:10] situation when you when you see these
[1:06:11] people the way the way they treat
[1:06:13] pastors the way they treat
[1:06:17] preachers and it's like well how how can
[1:06:19] that be the spirit of God and you act
[1:06:21] like
[1:06:24] that see because if you understand that
[1:06:28] you have if you have the Holy Spirit and
[1:06:30] I have the Holy Spirit Then guess what?
[1:06:32] They don't act like they don't act like
[1:06:35] that. Why? Because there's a unity of
[1:06:37] the faith. There's a there's a oneness
[1:06:39] there that'll bring you into into
[1:06:41] continuity with each other and to bring
[1:06:43] into fellowship in love with each
[1:06:46] other. Because you know what brother Ram
[1:06:48] said if you don't have love for one
[1:06:50] another. He said you it's time for you
[1:06:52] to get in the altar and start
[1:06:55] praying when you see that because it's
[1:06:57] just like raising your children and and
[1:06:59] you because you know you don't you don't
[1:07:01] want to
[1:07:04] be it's not because you want to be like
[1:07:06] that. You don't want to be hard on your
[1:07:08] children. But you realize that's what
[1:07:09] you've got to do sometimes. You've got
[1:07:11] to you've got to hold up the standard
[1:07:14] before your children and tell them this
[1:07:15] is the way it's got to be.
[1:07:19] You got to hold it up and realize this
[1:07:20] is what you've got to
[1:07:24] do. See, when you understand how how
[1:07:27] respon how responsible you are in these
[1:07:29] situations, realizing when you've got to
[1:07:31] you've got to hold this standard before
[1:07:33] the church, the congregation, you've got
[1:07:35] to live the
[1:07:37] life and you've got to you got to take
[1:07:39] you've got to take responsibility for
[1:07:41] your actions, everything that you do,
[1:07:43] everything that you say.
[1:07:46] I don't mind I don't mind
[1:07:48] apologizing. One of my favorite quotes
[1:07:50] from brother Dale ever said, you know,
[1:07:52] he said he said, if you come to me, he
[1:07:54] said, I'll apologize you whe to you
[1:07:56] whether I done anything wrong or
[1:08:01] not. That's a that's an that's an
[1:08:03] amazing thing because a lot of people
[1:08:06] wouldn't do that. I didn't do nothing
[1:08:08] wrong and I'm sorry you can just take
[1:08:10] your heart feelings home with
[1:08:14] you. But no, you see you see this this
[1:08:17] condition understanding that if you
[1:08:19] understand the Holy Spirit working in
[1:08:22] somebody and the life and here brother
[1:08:25] Rams talking
[1:08:27] about the the man being over the wife
[1:08:31] and understanding she reverence her
[1:08:33] husband and he give honor to the wife
[1:08:37] and brother was standing there and he
[1:08:38] was talking about you know when you
[1:08:40] realize that you you stand there and
[1:08:42] understand it's a one that says
[1:08:45] Brother Ryan has so eloquently told us
[1:08:48] so many
[1:08:49] times to understand about this
[1:08:54] relationship. It's like you understand
[1:08:56] your your
[1:08:58] life and it's like your marriage is
[1:09:01] supposed to be between Christ and the
[1:09:07] bride. It's like, well, I'm woefully
[1:09:12] inadequate, but you know what? I've got
[1:09:13] a goal. I know what I need to be
[1:09:16] reaching for. I know where I where I
[1:09:18] need to
[1:09:20] be. He's like, "Well, I I had got there
[1:09:22] yet, but you know what? I but I've got a
[1:09:24] goal and I see where the mark has to
[1:09:27] be." And you see, you understand where
[1:09:29] you've got to be. When when when brother
[1:09:32] Rab said, you know, when you when you
[1:09:34] understand, he was standing there and he
[1:09:35] was talking about how women the way they
[1:09:37] act and and they get out from underneath
[1:09:39] the word and they do their own thing and
[1:09:41] everything and you know, he was standing
[1:09:42] there and he said, listen, he said, when
[1:09:44] you do those things, he said, your
[1:09:46] husband will give an account for you. He
[1:09:49] said, you will never give an account for
[1:09:51] your husband, but you'll give but the
[1:09:53] husband will give an account for his
[1:09:54] wife. because he stood there and he was
[1:09:56] preaching and and he was talking about
[1:09:57] the women, the way they dressed, they
[1:09:58] cut their hair, all these different
[1:10:00] things, the way they acted. And he said,
[1:10:01] "And you men and you preachers standing
[1:10:04] in the pull pits and he called them a
[1:10:06] bunch of sissies in the pull pits
[1:10:08] because you won't tell them the truth."
[1:10:09] And he said, "You just allow your wife
[1:10:11] to run all over you and do whatever she
[1:10:13] wants to." And not realizing you're
[1:10:14] going to give an account for
[1:10:17] that, but realizing that you have to.
[1:10:19] But you know, everybody
[1:10:21] and understand this one thing. You know,
[1:10:24] I've heard people talk about it like,
[1:10:26] "Well, you know what? My husband's going
[1:10:27] to give an account for me and act like
[1:10:30] that's some kind of jail get out of jail
[1:10:34] card." It's like, "Well, you know what?
[1:10:36] Here, I'm just I can just skip on
[1:10:39] by. It's all going to fall on the
[1:10:42] husband." Well, you know what? If the
[1:10:44] husband tells you and tries to lead you
[1:10:47] right by the word and tries to lead you
[1:10:49] in the right way and you don't do it,
[1:10:51] guess what? You answer.
[1:10:56] You know, it's just like you stand there
[1:10:58] and because you know it's so funny
[1:11:00] because people I've heard people say
[1:11:01] that and it's like you ever read
[1:11:05] Genesis? You ever read Genesis in the
[1:11:09] scripture when Adam and Eve found out
[1:11:11] they were naked and they were trying to
[1:11:13] hide from God in the garden and he came
[1:11:14] to them was looking for them and he come
[1:11:17] to him and he's like, "Well, I hid
[1:11:19] myself cuz I found out I was naked. I
[1:11:20] realized I was naked." And he said, 'Who
[1:11:23] told you he was
[1:11:24] naked? And he began to speak to Adam
[1:11:28] about the condition. And oh, it was Eve,
[1:11:32] the woman that the woman he gave me.
[1:11:34] Sir, sir. And then she's over pointing
[1:11:37] the finger. Is a serpent. He begauled
[1:11:42] me. Everybody's pointing fingers.
[1:11:45] Somebody else's
[1:11:47] fault. But you know what? when he
[1:11:50] come, brother Bram said they all
[1:11:53] received
[1:11:54] judgment. And so it wasn't like, well,
[1:11:56] you know what? I just I just get out
[1:11:57] from underneath it. Hey, I'm just
[1:12:02] No, he received a judgment
[1:12:05] also. And Adam was standing there and
[1:12:08] God told him said, "Because you've
[1:12:09] hearkened under the voice of your
[1:12:13] wife, the ground is cursed."
[1:12:16] See, there was a judgment brought on all
[1:12:18] three of
[1:12:19] them. And so when you come to the house
[1:12:22] of God, this is the house of judgment.
[1:12:24] This where judgment starts in the house
[1:12:26] of
[1:12:27] God. And whatever you have in your life,
[1:12:30] you say, "Well, I you know, you don't
[1:12:31] you're not going to get by with
[1:12:36] it because you know what? You can either
[1:12:38] get rid of it now or you can hold it.
[1:12:40] But you know, somewhere along the way in
[1:12:42] your lifetime, you're going to have to
[1:12:44] give an account for it.
[1:12:45] You're not going to sweep it under the
[1:12:47] rug. You're not going to hide it from
[1:12:48] anybody. You can You can hide it from
[1:12:50] your parents. You can hide it from your
[1:12:52] wife. You can hide it from your husband.
[1:12:53] You can hide it from the pastor. But you
[1:12:55] know what? God
[1:12:57] knows. And you're not ever going to get
[1:12:59] by with it. You might you might think
[1:13:01] you can sweep it under the rug and hide
[1:13:02] it on this hub, but you know what?
[1:13:03] There's a day coming you'll give an
[1:13:08] account. So, what is it? There's there's
[1:13:11] leading of the Holy
[1:13:13] Spirit. And what what is what is the
[1:13:16] problem that people don't get any
[1:13:18] further than they do is because they
[1:13:20] don't go back to the word. And what is
