unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of the people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts amen and then flew one of the serpents unto me having a live Co in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this has touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away amen and thy sin purged and I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me let's bow our heads I want to speak on that thought for just a few minutes this afternoon on here am I send me let's bow our heads oh Mighty God how we thank you Lord for your blessings of life that you have given us amen Lord we are so grateful that we can gather here Lord under the revelation of Thy word that's

young people Lord we thank you for this opportunity may you have your way today we pray as we commit these things into thy hands for thy glory and the Saints Said Amen in Jesus name God bless you you may be seated this afternoon here am I send me you know brothers and sisters we're living today in an age that is the most deceiving it is the wickedest and the darkest of all ages amen we're living in the age that is a consummation of all of the evil of the six previous ages all the evil that was in Luther's day and Wesley's day has all come up to a head in this day that we are now living in and the Bible said as it was in the days of Noah when men's Hearts were continually evil so shall it be in that day when the son of man shall be revealed amen and I was talking to my wife the other day and I was telling her you know I said by God's grace he he has allowed us to see yeah and because we see light sometimes I think we fail to realize just how blinded this generation has become you know you cannot really appreciate Darkness if you can still see light and even if you Su your eyelids you know you can still see light through the eyelids but we're living in a time when there's gross Darkness upon the Earth and gross Darkness upon the people and I think because that we can see light that sometimes we fail to realize just how dark it is it's really hard to comprehend blindness if you can see right come on brother is that all right the world we're living in today is now moving in almost Total Insanity it's the darkest and the gross darkness that has B this age that has drawn the people into Insanity yeah it is an age of me yep and not of us right amen it is an age of isolation it is a day of selflove when people love their s more than they love their brother right amen it's an isolation and in darkness drives humans to the brink of insanity and we can understand that from the isolation of the covid that we have just come through and how it isolated the people and the Darkness of the age you can see the insanity that has manifested among the people and science actually did in experiments and they found out that isolation total isolation and darkness drives humans to the brid of insanity this Leia age is the age of blindness it is the age of Darkness that darkness that it's in our College it's in our schools it's it's in our neighborhoods it's in our governments and you might as well say Amen it's the truth it's an age of Deceit it's an age of falsehood it's an age of fake news right amen amen the prophet of God said it this way he said blind Lea how blind can we get blind Lea the leading of the blind to this age under false pretense under false Creeds under dogmas that's false under denominations that's false under Creeds and books that's false oh blind layout seea leading the blind you're all headed for the ditch blind leaders of the blind will they not all fall into the ditch truly a blind leay on I see a church age just exactly what the Bible said would be amen right so blinded the prophet said that they cannot see how miserable how deceived that they really are for they say I am in cre I am rich I set as a queen I have need of nothing and the Bible said knowest thou not that you're poor miserable blinded wretched naked and don't even know it right it's the thus sayith the Lord of Revelations 3 amen the prophet said if you've never read it you need to read it that's what she is and she don't even realize it that's right no wonder the Bible said in the last days it shall come to pass what is it there'll be signs in the heavens flying saucers where even the Pentagon don't even know what to think about it and if you follow the news you found out that for once here in just the last few years that our government has actually acknowledged that they've been investigating UFOs right unidentified flying objects to pagon finally admits it investigating UFOs fearful sights of the sky mid Hearts failing for fear perlex of time distress between nations as our brother sang about all seing Sands of Time the sea Roar and tidle waves earthquakes the prophet said but you know what I'm thinking said Jesus said before he comes there'll be signs in the heaven above did you notice before he destroys Sodom and gomorra because of their sex Affairs he sent Angels down to investigate it and angels has come to the Earth in the last few years they call UFOs the prophet said they don't know what it is but we know it's investigating Angels they've even stood and had their picture taken that's right Angelic beings has visited taking the word of God back to the father that sin is heaped up till the Stars can hardly Shine the moon in the world is reeling like a drunk man coming in at night right but no matter how dark it gets come on brother God never changes his word God's word never changes there's a pattern to God's word he has never changed this pattern of word he prophesies what will happen did he send somebody down to vindicate that amen like the days of Noah God said he would destroy the Earth he sent Noah to tell the people get into the ark it's going to rain he prophesies what will happen then he sends somebody down and vindicates that and it goes over the head of Millions right because Darkness covers the earth at that time and people love Darkness more than they do light right cuz Darkness has a lot of pleasure amen said I seen a Hollywood play not long ago said Life begins after the sun goes down he said that's when death begins right when all these nightclubs and where they think they're living they think they're living but they're dying right and so is it today that the gross darkness is coming up on the people and here we are friends this is where we're at in 2025 you said brother Daryl this is Young people's meeting I thought she was going to encourage us just hang on hang amen go ahead amen gross darknesses upon the people he said there'll be earthquakes in diverse places earthquakes in diverse places and I looked up do you know in the last 24 hours in the United States alone there has been 165 earthquakes just in the US just in the US over 480 some earthquakes worldwide in the last 24 hours and the Bible said there would be earthquakes in many different places it only increases all the time the oall is getting thin the coming of the Lord is at hand the judgments of God that he spoke of he said the people will get to the place that they'll all away and gross Darkness will cover the Earth and when spiritual Darkness gets up the Earth it's the time for the enemy to attack that's right we're in that hour of gross Darkness you know I just come through the floods up in Western North Carolina if you've not seen the destruction it's just you can't even comprehend it in your mind when the Nola Chucky come out of its river banks up there and how it washed away Irwin and and the different places over there in Western and Eastern Western North Carolina and Eastern Tennessee and that flood just came in Tak buildings taking I've seen cars six foot off the ground up in trees wow wow I seen pumpkins that was in a pumpkin patch 8 foot off the ground stuck up in trees because of the flood and when it comes in with the oh my when the flood comes in it just washes away everything right you can see some of the videos that's on YouTube how that it's just in a moment of time it destroyed houses broke them up and washed them away the spiritual Darkness upon the Earth has opened up the flood GES to allow the God of this evil age to unleash his destruction Upon Our communities upon our government our homes our family Satan is like a flood a raging River of water destroying anything that's in his path the Bible said the thief cometh not but for to steal to kill and to destroy that is the world around us as we know it today under a spirit of destruction righten you say you pay dark picture that's where we're at but oh praise God for God said when the enemy comes in like a flood God said I will raise up a standard against it and if God said he will do it he will do it amen I believe the enemy's dashing and God's here right now his raising up a standard what is the standard it's the word of God heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail amen the word can't change or be changed because it is the word of God H the ground they seek and stand on Christ the solid rock I stand in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh amen then the word of God made flesh is the standard that God are you listening to me the word of God made flesh is the standard that God raises up Sir amen Peter said on the day of Pentecost he said this is that which is spoken by the prophet Joel it'll come to pass in the last day sayith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and when he preached under the anointing of the Holy Ghost people were shouting praising God they were picked in their hearts and the Jews are stand by said what must we do to be saved and he said men and Brethren repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children even as far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call hallelujah hallelujah I'm so glad he's left us witness in this hour that we're living in he has not left us in this Dark Age without a witness amen amen the Holy Ghost is to be poured out upon you and upon your children even as far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call what the church was at Pentecost is the standard yes absolutely amen that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholars say right brother God has not changed that pattern what God did at Pentecost he has to keep on do it amen until the church ages closed right amen that if you go in a Rapture young people it'll not be because you believe God sent a prophet it'll not be because you've got a message book come on somebody but the only way is you have met this person Hallelujah and that life is burning in your soul amen that's the only thing that'll take us out of this Earth amen it's not enough that's no more than sting your name on a row you must have that experience with God that's right amen hallelujah what happened on the day of Pentecost what happened the Prophecies of the prophets was made flesh amen abely when the enemy comes in like a flood the word of God will raise a standard up against it and we just looked at the flood of the darkness of leosia then what is the standard that God is raising up in this hour not a Creed not a Dogman not a church member but the word made flesh once again in my flesh and your flesh making him the same yesterday today and forever amen Hallelujah the standard is the word God will raise up a standard against it it's the word made flesh the Dynamics and the mechanics working in a body on the earth God has allotted his word God has allotted his word to be manifested in this day right in the day of gross Darkness it's the only light we have Jesus said I'm the light of the world then he turn said you're the light of the world did he forget what he said did he change his mind no he was giving you a revelation I'm the light of the world now you'll be the light of the world why CU he will be in you hallelujah what

kingdom down some young person's going to overcome some young person's going to be victorious some young person's going to take a body change some young person's going to be that word made flesh I say to you this afternoon why not you here am I send me oh it may seem strange a very strange thing in an age of Grace when God's taking the people for his name's sake his bride that in this evil age should be called an age of evil when there is a God in this age called the God of this evil age right this very age when this darkness is upon the Earth that we have described to you when we see the world in this Condition it's at that time God is calling the people amen for his name's sake calling the people calling the young people out of this evil age right this is the age that he's speaking of a very strange thing to think that that in this evil age like this that God would be calling his bride right can anything good come out of Nazareth can anything good come out of lay out of sea I say yes I'm looking at it amen he said a people notice he didn't say a church he said a people those people will be called a church but he's not calling a church he's calling a people calling mommies calling daddies calling Brothers calling sister individ the word made flesh amen right he's calling the people I say why not us amen why not now amen here am I Lord send me Amen in our scripture reading we find King Uzziah and Isaiah the prophet he lived in the days of Uzziah the king and both of them were young together they were bus and Buddies the prophet and the King they were just the prophets said they were Chums and Isaiah stayed at the palace and he leaned upon the arm of the king and we find out this young king had such an influence over Isaiah right he became a hero to Isaiah listen to me young people choose your friends wisely if you have a friend that tries to pull you away from this message they are not your friend if you've got a boyfriend that tries to pull you away from this message they are not the right boy for you come on somebody come on somebody say Amen you know it's the truth how Satan would like to wreck out our lives and crash us up and throw us into a prison house but I'm telling you he has come to open the prison doors here not long ago I Saw an Eagle try to fly now an eagle is a heaven born bird meant them sell into Heavens I was coming down through Kentucky and I come down this country road and this bald eagle fell out of the sky and he dropped down on the road and he picked up a dead I believe it was AP possum if my memory serves me right and I was coming down the road and I was watching this and this even e was trying to lift off the ground with this posum but it was too heavy for him and it was dragging him down but I watched him you know what he did he finally let go of it because I was approaching him danger was approaching and he finally let go of the thing that was holding him back and I say to you if you're Eagle if something is holding you down if something won't let you fly to where God want you to be it's time to let go we was bornn for the heavens come on somebody we was born not to be defeated we're living in a defeated age but we are not a defeated people do you understand we was born we was predestinated we was ordained of God for the Rapture he can put you in Jesus day he can have put you in Luther's day he can have put you in Wesley's day he can to put you in the age of the restoration of the gifts but he placed you here now amen right thank you Lord amen they were buo and buddies but this King was a bad influence over Isaiah the prophet said you see the king and made an example before Isaiah Isaiah seen that the king as soon as he got out of his calling God smoted him with Leprosy right and Isaiah thought what must I do Uzziah was dead he had leaned heavily on his arm and he thought he was gone what would he do life itself was gone for him nearly Y what did the Young Prophet do he made his way down to the temple to pray right he fell down at the altar and he cried out that's where it has to begin for all of us young people we know the altars in your heart you know what I'm saying but it's come to that place that if something is influencing away from God it's time to break away from that and come down to the Altar and settle it with God Amen you said brother darl I've had such a rough time sometimes if you got to understand some sometimes God will let the very prompts be knocked out from under us that's right sometimes he lets sickness strike us he lets disappointments heartache strike sometimes he does that to get you where you can be influenced by the word of God the prophet said be wise enough to catch it yeah don't be stupid enough to walk away from it right Amen brother what a powerful statement from the prophet of God be wise enough to catch it don't be stupid enough to walk away from it what's God doing Milestones changing our Direction I just listen at it coming down the road today from that time from that time many of us we have a place for for for us I was thinking coming on the road for us for my family it's from that time of the accident when Jessica was struck by the train and two of our family was killed everything goes back from that time our lives changed drastically and when you meet God from that time you're never the same again you can come to the altar you can make all kinds of promises you can make all kinds of New Year resolutions but until you meet God Amen right and have an experience for yourself you can't go in on dy's experience you can't go in on the pastor's experience you've got to know him for yourself but the most wonderful thing about it is he wants to know you that way amen Shades in our directions at Junctions of time in the altar is where he caught the vision he seen God sitting on the throne he said and I saw God lifted up way up above any man here on Earth above a Solomon or a David or a Uzziah God was lifted to a place that man could not come and then he become influenced of another way he saw God lifted up Highway up his train and when he saw those Mighty beings and the palace was filled the smoke and he looked at the pillars of the temple and the post began to shake at their voice he never saw that by Uzziah he saw that he saw that IM mortal man could fall no matter how much he's blessed he could still fall but he looked at the one who can not fall whose Foundation is sure even the pillars of the temple moved at their voices and he begin to confess he said woe is me right for I am undone because I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell amst the people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts amen and after his confession comes his cleansing and then from the cleansing come the commission amen that was the commission after he confessed and after he was cleansed it was then that the clean Isaiah answered God and said here am I Lord send me amen after he was cleansed and confessed cleansed by fire then the clean Isaiah was ready for work he was ready to be an example he was ready to have his life put out that others could be influenced by him amen right but until he had confessed it until he was clean he was a very poor influence right just a puppet for a king right you know brother said he was out in California he saw a man come walking down the street said I'm a fool for Jesus Christ and people was laughing at him and making fun of him and Prophet said when the man walked by he had a sign on his back and said who fool are you and the prophet said we're going to be somebody's fool right you're going to be somebody's puppet I say let's be surrendered out to the king of glory that is like can shine through us that we can be the right kind of influence on our friends our boyfriends our girlfriends our mama our daddy come on somebody somebody's going to be even the light somebody's going to manifest that word that God promised it would be here somebody's going to be that are you ready are you ready a confession and a cleansing and a commission let's go down to the house of God let's have the hearts at the altar let's look up and see what Jesus looks like which is the word then we can answer Lord here I am send me am send me to the house to be a better wife right send me to school to be a better teenage girl send me to school to be a better teenage boy send me to the pulpit to be a different kind of Minister send me to my business to be a different kind of businessman when we see you are our example Jesus Christ am

their lives crashed out dying in a Lon hotel room somewhere that's not our example that's not what he put us here to be Amen Let Us put us here to be an example you see listen to me if everybody took Christ as their example think about this if everybody took Christ as their example we could fire every policeman y that was in this nation today right amen if everybody took Jesus Christ as their example amen if everybody would be meek and humble if everybody would be kind and have brotherly love for one another right that would never be a divorce case ever played in our country that's right that would never be any sickness n we could dismiss every hospital right if everybody tried to make Jesus Christ their EXA we wouldn't have a need of nothing else amen right amen but I say this today this city Lula Lula Georgia this city will never make Jesus Christ their example right this nation that I love when I was a young man I joined the army to serve my country to protect the rights and freedom I just love this country but this nation I know you can put a trump on every corner you'll never change this nation right she'll never make Christ as her example the state of Georgia the people they'll never make Christ as their example not the mayor n not the governor right not the president n not the city not the state not the nation that's right and it's sad to say but not even in every Church come on right will they make Christ as their example but I say to you wouldn't it be wonderful if you did amen yeah if I did if it would just start with me amen amen amen if it would just start with me amen I say why not you right why not us brother amen why not now say Lord send me let me be that example Amen Let Me Be his humility let me be his love let me be his longsuffering let

every hand so many horrible things facing us facing this nation but we have the assurance that when the enemy comes in like a flood the word of God will raise a standard up against it the God the Father promised it I'm so thankful so here am I Lord don't let the devil lie to you and tell you it's not for you the spirit of God is calling you he calls through the ministry he calls through the song service he calls through the specials he's wooing you like a dove calling to its mate telling it's you you're the one I want you're the one I need amen God don't need my ability God don't need my education God don't need my finances he just needs my skin yeah don't let the devil lie to you and tell you it's not for you or tell you you've gone too far or you've made a horrible mistake we've all

hear his call will you answer him here am I Lord who will be Jesus to a Dying World who will be the light in the darkness of Le OFA amen who will be Jesus to them amen right amen I heard a story it always stuck with me just before we close here a few year ago some businessmen lived they lived in New Jersey but they worked over in New York and so every Friday they would catch what we call a puddle jumper flight out of New York and go back down into New Jersey and so they told their wives said we'll get together Friday evening for supper and we'll all eat together and so it had been a a busy week and they was late and so when they got to the airport they was late anybody's ever been at the airport Lake there's only one way to get to the gate that's run and so they was run and try to get to the gate so they could catch the flight home to be with their wives and when they come around the corner they saw this girl she had an apple cart but it was to late they ran all over her they knocked her off of her stool knocked the card over knocked the apples everywhere but they kept on running and when they got to the gate one of them got the feeling bad and he told his his buddies he said you go on I I feel bad I'm going to go back and check on that girl and they said you better come on your your wife's expecting you he said tell her what happened tell her I catch the later flight out see her later on tonight when he goes back to where this girl is she's still in the floor and she's weeping and he noticed for the first time she was blind and she was going would someone help me please would say oh Jesus please help me Jesus and so the man went over and he picked up the cart and he picked up the stool and he he lifted it up and said here you sit here and he picked up all the apples and all the ones that were bruised he set them aside so she wouldn't sell them and all the ones that wasn't he cleans them up and stacked them all up and then he pulled $20 out of his pocket and he placed it in her hand he said now these are for the apples that we bruise that you can't sell it's more than enough and he said we're so sorry that we that this happened to you he said but I need to go check about my flight he said but you're okay and as he turned to leave this little blind girl spoke up and said mister are you Jesus come on now he said no no no no why why would you think that she said cuz I was in the floor nobody would help me I said Jesus would you please help me he said I no sooner said that and I heard you speak said I just wondering come on now are you Jesus he said no I follow him but I'm not him and he got on the plane and he got to thinking looking out the window flying over into New Jersey those words mister are you Jesus and I say this as we close that'd be live the kind of life that if my neighbor was blind come on they can never see my Eagle belt buckle they can never see my Malachi four license plade or all those things that we identify with this message do I live such a life that if my neighbor was blind I could still see Jesus I could still see Jesus help us Lord amen I want my wife to see him I want my children to see him I want my grandchildren to see jesusall and there's only one way to do that I just surrender to you say Here I Am Lord right take my life take my take everything about me amen and use Me For Your Glory that's right right amen as we come to the close I wonder friends as we come into this new year it was just a few days into it what do you really want to accomplish this year if your life is cut short and they roll you up here what will they say about our life oh let him say one thing I saw Jesus in that man I saw Jesus in that young girl I saw Jesus in that young boy brother that the world in this age of gross darkness when God said he would raise ra up a standard the word made flesh you be that standard how do I do it brother Dar how could I become that there's only one way that's to surrender at an altar and the altar is in your heart amen just let God let go let God have his wonderful way amen when the co of fire touch the prophet making him as pure as pure can be when the voice of God said he'll go for us right then he answered he couldn't answer till then but then he answered Master here am I send me send me do you love him thank you Lord let's just bow our heads I trust we've not kept you long I know you got food and some things planned but it just come on my heart this yesterday evening and I was looking at this and I thought oh God oh God let me live that kind of life right

meeting is not in vain there'd be one young person one Mama one daddy one brother one sister that would make that commitment today oh God for we know Lord that one person on fire can set the whole church on fire oh Lord God I pray father in the name of Jesus let it start here at the pull pit with me Lord Lord as I lay before your altar today dear God I ask you Lord cleanse me dear God set me aside Use Me For Your Glory oh God let me let me be a witness let my wife let my children Lord let my family see to you Lord I pray Grant it today Lord grant it today May the word speak to the hearts of your people Grant it father we ask in Jesus name well every heads bowed just for a moment if you're here and not to point you out not to embarrass you I wouldn't do that for nothing but if the word has spoke to your heart look look young people look look around us look what's happening out in California right now she's burning to the ground and she'll slide beneath the ocean she's doomed we see these things happening the words that the prophet said would take place that's happening all around us and are you ready are you ready have you let things come in between you have you got your focus on something else you want to something get you look there's there's nothing wrong with trying to get an education but don't let the education take the place of God don't let your job don't let your ambition of what you want to be in life let it take the place of God in your life put him first as I read many year ago a book I think it was by Jim Brown if I remember Sergey right called I am third my God is first my family is second and I am third always put God first in your life if you hear and the word has spoke to you I wonder if you just raise your hand and say here am I Lord Oh Lord use

refuse me there's a work that I can do and even though it's humble Lord help my my will to crumble and though the cross be great I'll work for you oh [Music] Jesus Oh Lord can we just raise our hands to him now let it be your commitment for surely there a work that I can do and even though it's humble Lord help my will to crumble oh the cross be great our for you God bless you Saints oh Jesus me oh Lord refuse for surely there a work that I can do you Joy it's humble Lord help my will to crumble oh the cross be great our you know I'm glad that God doesn't think like we think he said my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways amen if we were ly minded people when we read that scripture that God would raise up a standard we would think man he's going to build some some big steel and metal and if you go to the Pentagon and they say well this person's got got a weapon and what do we do we start putting our mind together and we start putting stuff together all God wants a human flesh that's all he wants amen he wants a yielded human flesh that's the standard that God's raising in this hour and Satan can't stand it cuz that's the weakest thing that is on the face of the earth is your flesh right and God's going to use it to raise that standard up and I've always said I don't want to be in the bomb shelter I don't want to be underground all I want is for his feathers to cover me when the storm go goes to raging right I want to be under his wing I don't care about all this stuff that they make in the the military makes it'll do no good right but the word of God that we heard today apply that to your life and there's your feathers there's your wings right and we get underneath that nothing can harm us you know I was thinking yesterday they they said some of the firefighters almost got caught in some of those uh cross winds and storms and stuff and I thought well you know they're Brave they're human and they're doing their job right but there's one that walked through the fire for me amen and it didn't kill him right it put him on a cross sure but he's walking right now through your life whatever fire you're going through he's right there with you and if he can't be consumed you can't be consumed that's right but that's human nature that we we want to protect human beings and that's fine but we got a God that fire doesn't bother him at all amen you asked the three Hebrew children right it didn't bother them either God went down there with them I love what brother Ram said that time he said the angel said you let me go down there wormwood said let me go down there let me go down there God said no this one's mine I'm going down there myself and I believe he's come down here in the end time his s the son of man to live in the hearts of the people and to destroy Satan by God in human flesh not by Swords not by chemicals and material mm no our flesh that's how he's going to be defeated and that's where he beats on all the time and that's okay right but we know there's one inside of us that's greater greater is he that's in us and he that's in the world right amen you love the Lord let's give our brother a big hand wonderful job you know Isaiah was a real young man I mean really young he was very young I I think 20 or so years old so brothers sisters God can use you at that age right but you got to say as Isaiah said though first clean me up then use me right I always tell people when we baptized I said you got to repent the Bible just don't say being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is Right Paul Peter said repent and be baptized so repent and that'll do you some good you'll get the promise thank God for the promises that we have amen good to be here good to have you here today I hope something's been said that'll strike your heart if not today maybe tomorrow maybe maybe the next day but we're going to pray over the food the food's downstairs ready for you just worship Fellowship

that's going on right now and that we're receiving that message that Trump Lord I pray today that we heard that call and Lord if some that need salvation healing Lord just a um just a a spark from you Lord I pray today that we'll get that father all of us from the oldest to the youngest father be with brother Daryl and keep him strong father give him Supernatural strength Lord and I pray as we go

world father thank you for all the ones come Lord I pray that if you'll be with them Lord if they have to go back on the highways that you'll protect them Father and be with each one Lord be with the ones that are sick that could make it Lord we ask you just bless us now in Jesus name amen God bless you you're dismissed over my soul sweep over my soul sweep my soul sweet Spirit sweep
