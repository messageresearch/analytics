[16:12] and keep us in jesus name amen
[16:15] we're going to Matthew 24 Matthew 24
[16:23] we'll begin about verse 15 he says when
[16:29] you therefore shall see the abomination
[16:31] of desolation spoken of by Daniel the
[16:34] prophet stand in the Holy Place whoso
[16:37] readeth let him understand now that's
[16:40] really the mosque of Omar alright
[16:43] standing in the holy place you're in
[16:46] that position the mosque of Omar as we
[16:48] call it so then is the abomination that
[16:51] maketh desolation alright then let them
[16:54] which be in Judea flee into the mountain
[16:58] let him which be on the housetop not
[17:01] come down to take anything out of his
[17:03] house neither let him which is in the
[17:06] field return back to take his clothes
[17:09] and woe unto them that are with suck and
[17:12] to them that give suck with child in
[17:16] them that you'll suck in the last days
[17:17] alright now this is coming on down to
[17:20] from the mosque of Omar coming down to
[17:23] Titus and AD 70 alright we'll treat you
[17:27] to review that just a little bit but
[17:28] that's actually what's taking place here
[17:30] is this is what happened in Titus in AD
[17:33] 70 when he come into destroyed Jerusalem
[17:36] that's why that was bad for them to be
[17:38] here they couldn't be left they was left
[17:40] in the city then they'd be destroyed so
[17:43] they had to leave okay
[17:44] we pray ye that your flight be not in
[17:46] the winter neither on the Sabbath day so
[17:49] you get out of Jerusalem Titus was
[17:51] coming for then shall be Great
[17:53] Tribulation such as was not since the
[17:56] beginning of the world to this time no
[17:58] nor ever shall be except those days
[18:02] should be shortened there should no
[18:04] flesh be saved but for the elects sake
[18:07] those days shall be shortened then if
[18:10] any man shall say unto you lo here is
[18:12] Christ or thyre believe it not now we'll
[18:18] get to that in a minute we'll do who's
[18:19] this Christ for there shall arise false
[18:22] Christ's and false prophets and shall
[18:26] show great signs and wonders and so much
[18:30] that if it were possible they shall
[18:31] deceive the very elect now we know they
[18:33] will not be able to be very close behold
[18:37] I have told you before wherefore if they
[18:41] shall say unto you behold he is in the
[18:44] desert in other words this great Christ
[18:46] this Antichrist is in time being you
[18:50] know wherefore if they shall say unto
[18:52] you behold he is in the desert go not
[18:55] forth behold he is in the secret
[18:58] chambers believe it not for as the
[19:01] Lightning cometh out of the east and
[19:03] shina 'the even unto the West so shall
[19:06] also the coming of the Son of man be now
[19:09] coming right down to the last days now
[19:11] here's the point for who saw it for
[19:14] water so ever the carcass is there shall
[19:18] the Eagles be gathered together amen he
[19:21] must be seated the Lord had his blessing
[19:25] for the reading of the word now we won't
[19:28] we tried to pick up a little bit the
[19:31] life service and spoke just a little bit
[19:34] about anointed ones but we want to make
[19:37] sure - to see this and find out because
[19:40] it says here in the last days they'd be
[19:43] false Christ the false Christ Matthew 24
[19:49] that would be false Christ don't go
[19:52] after them they'll say that here there
[19:54] say they'll die there say their doctor
[19:56] don't go after them
[19:58] because you get caught and you'll be in
[20:01] the wrong place alright so as I'm saying
[20:04] this is when it comes down to the mosque
[20:06] of Omar that was to be put it was put
[20:09] into the place door of the temple and
[20:11] then coming on down to Titus when Titus
[20:14] came into Jerusalem and destroyed it in
[20:17] AD 70 senior fulfilling the Scriptures
[20:19] of what is to take place all right it's
[20:23] not something hard to be understood it's
[20:26] something that we must think about for a
[20:28] little bit all right seeing those things
[20:31] as it happened but then we come on down
[20:33] to the very hour that we're living okay
[20:37] and someone would come and say there
[20:40] Christ all right now for someone to come
[20:44] today and get up and preach in the
[20:45] pulpits around America even and say that
[20:49] he's Jesus well now there's some white
[20:51] balls and twist up points along the way
[20:54] that some will do that but not not a
[20:58] whole lot they're not going to say that
[20:59] they're Jesus because that's just a
[21:02] little bit too much but they'll be
[21:05] saying they are the Christ because
[21:08] Christ means The Anointed One all right
[21:12] that's what the word Christ me because
[21:13] that's who Jesus was he was the Lord
[21:15] Lord the Christ he was the anointed God
[21:19] he was God in human flesh what all God
[21:24] was he poured into Christ see pouring
[21:27] himself into that human flesh that we
[21:30] called Jesus and he was called the
[21:32] Christ all right so then Christ means
[21:35] The Anointed One all right he's putting
[21:40] in that place so we believe in the Lord
[21:42] Jesus Christ we believe in the Christ
[21:44] and it being in the correct way because
[21:47] Christ is among us Christ is that
[21:49] baptism with the Holy Ghost that you
[21:51] have in the new birth that is the Christ
[21:53] that's the son of the Living God coming
[21:56] and living in you see to make us to what
[22:00] we need to be alright so then it's the
[22:02] Christ it's this age this is the age of
[22:06] the fulfilling of all things we would
[22:09] have to admit that we were
[22:10] down here at the end of all of it if you
[22:13] don't then go home turn on the news and
[22:15] look what's happening between the time
[22:17] you were in service here in an hour or
[22:19] so and you go home and read what's
[22:21] happened and you'll see the world is
[22:23] fastly falling apart
[22:25] all right and those things are taking
[22:28] place around the world you'll see
[22:29] earthquakes in divers places and all
[22:32] kind of things that we just read about
[22:34] all of the the masses of destruction is
[22:37] taking place in our day all right we'll
[22:41] see then we're not to look at those
[22:42] things a lot of people have taught and
[22:45] I'm not throwing off and on nobody but
[22:47] they've talked you know that Russia is
[22:49] this communism is this and this is that
[22:52] it is but there's no scripture for
[22:54] communism or Russia coming to take over
[22:57] that's just man's ideas there's no
[23:00] scripture that teaches that there is I'd
[23:04] like to see it
[23:04] you know you say well it's this is the
[23:07] king of that is you know but it's
[23:09] remember it's not that it's got to be
[23:12] something religious if the word Christ
[23:17] means The Anointed One and if that we do
[23:22] believe in the Lord Jesus Christ you
[23:24] know and believing him to be Almighty
[23:26] God all right see then we're looking for
[23:30] something to be deceiving not just
[23:33] something to say this you know and I've
[23:36] always told you my my brother-in-law he
[23:38] used to say that what he thought would
[23:40] be that great beast in the end time
[23:41] would be a great big King Kong walking
[23:44] across the earth you know no one walking
[23:46] like that I said well now who's that
[23:48] going to deceive I said might scare a
[23:51] lot of people you know and they decide
[23:54] to run but it ain't going to deceive
[23:56] nobody it's got to be something very
[23:58] religious all right see that's why I'm
[24:02] referring to it as the Christ to get you
[24:05] to see me looking for that Christ
[24:09] because there is just one little bit
[24:12] added to it and what did it become in
[24:13] the last days is to be the Anti Christ
[24:17] right instead of Christ Antichrist
[24:22] all right Sid we've all blue
[24:24] can talk about as I said people say
[24:26] Russia China this Saturday order some of
[24:28] those countries they're there they're
[24:29] the Antichrist well we know they are the
[24:32] Antichrist because they're against
[24:33] Christ
[24:34] but yet that still doesn't make them the
[24:36] Antichrist because it tells us here that
[24:40] to be careful that these things can
[24:44] happen and it would deceive the very
[24:46] elect if it was possible now that's how
[24:49] close it'll be so it can't be some King
[24:52] Kong monsters on this that or the other
[24:54] you know looking for those things don't
[24:56] get into that get into thinking about
[24:59] the Bible and looking at Jesus Christ
[25:02] and then seeing that it's got to be real
[25:04] close it can't be a great big art
[25:08] shutter some word over that and deceive
[25:10] with it it's got to be so close think
[25:15] all right so in the last days now is to
[25:20] come to an apostle 'ti of being so close
[25:23] that it would deceive the very elect if
[25:25] possible and like the Prophet said one
[25:27] day he said frankly to get them thought
[25:29] up that he had to cut it short you know
[25:31] he may have to do some things because of
[25:34] the deception in the land today because
[25:37] that's what people are believing all
[25:39] right looking for the Antichrist when
[25:42] we've all just been brought right down
[25:44] through that thing because anti-crisis
[25:47] Anti Jesus so we know it's not Jesus
[25:49] that we're looking for
[25:51] it's an antichrist it's an anointing so
[25:56] now you look across the land and you see
[25:58] it everywhere that you have these great
[26:00] ministers and great things taking place
[26:03] and some of you came through Pentecost
[26:04] and you saw the great things that happen
[26:07] back there in the anointings that would
[26:10] fall in and you see it today around the
[26:12] land of how the the things are that way
[26:14] but we've got to be careful because if
[26:18] it catches us in the wrong ranks we're
[26:22] gonna have problems and the wrong ranks
[26:25] to me is what I'm talking about is in
[26:27] the wrong position or thought as my old
[26:30] saying is if you're going to catch a bus
[26:33] don't go down to the airport
[26:35] you know there might be one down there
[26:38] but they don't tell me where you might
[26:39] get you get on it you know go to the bus
[26:42] depot alright so what am I saying what
[26:45] am i point go to the Word of God study
[26:48] the Word of God and see what the Word of
[26:51] God says about these things then as we
[26:53] see what it says then we can follow that
[26:56] and see the day that we're living and
[26:59] see right we're reading and why it's to
[27:01] be see don't worry about all of these
[27:03] great big things well here comes Russia
[27:05] will look Russia they're supposed to be
[27:08] down but don't worry about it
[27:09] now Russia will be used yes no come on
[27:12] Russia will be used the old buyer just
[27:15] went to sleep no see you don't worry
[27:18] about you come up there and there'll be
[27:19] bombs falling every which way one of
[27:21] these days because that's what they're
[27:22] building up see they just went
[27:24] undercover with it and and went bankrupt
[27:26] as we call it and if they demanded
[27:29] payment of us at the same time that they
[27:31] demanded it to them we would have went
[27:33] bankrupt you know but to see we're we
[27:36] can't do that called we're going to be
[27:38] overnight revelations 13 I don't want to
[27:41] get too much into that but you get over
[27:42] in Revelations 13 see the word 13th
[27:44] nation you know in different things
[27:45] that's the United States and who would
[27:48] have the power to control the world in a
[27:54] war outside of you and I I mean America
[27:58] the America has the power to control
[28:01] those things and that's why it's based
[28:03] on that and that's why we are in that
[28:05] position and no one is standing there
[28:07] horror but thinking now what we're going
[28:10] to talk about that the Bible said they
[28:15] would come false Christ right now we've
[28:19] established a point of what now Christ
[28:21] means The Anointed One alright and see
[28:27] then that's what we're looking for
[28:28] something to that is in the anointing
[28:32] rim to deceive you say yeah brother
[28:35] well God won't let us be deceived but
[28:40] you don't need to play too much with God
[28:43] either because there's a lot in the
[28:45] Bible that is dire and it's because of
[28:48] the fact
[28:49] to try you and I right how about just
[28:53] reading a few scriptures let's get a
[28:54] little bit this let's go through this
[28:56] this morning and then we'll get you know
[28:58] we'll get to the lives let's go to the
[29:00] number two brothers on our scripture
[29:03] there of Joel 2 let's just think about
[29:07] it says it shall come to pass afterward
[29:10] that I'll pour it my spirit upon all
[29:12] flesh and your sons and your daughters
[29:14] shall prophesy your old men shall dream
[29:17] dreams your young men shall see visions
[29:18] and also upon the servants and upon the
[29:22] handmaids in those days will I pour out
[29:24] my spirit and I will show wonders in the
[29:27] heavens and in the earth blood and fire
[29:29] and pillars of smoke all right yeah
[29:32] Joel is speaking of in the compound form
[29:36] so think about it now he's speaking of
[29:39] the coming of the day of Pentecost when
[29:44] God poured out his spirit upon the
[29:47] people of that day you know alright but
[29:49] it didn't finish that because he said he
[29:52] poured out upon all flesh see it comes
[29:54] on down to a greater meaning so it's in
[29:57] our day our day is to expect to see and
[30:02] Azusa Street fulfill that to the point
[30:05] of the Spirit of God being poured out
[30:08] there on the day of Azusa Street in 1906
[30:12] there in in California and that
[30:15] fulfilled that but that's still not to
[30:17] finish because he's gonna pour it out
[30:20] upon all flesh you mean God will pour
[30:23] out his Spirit upon far oh yeah he
[30:25] poured rest this morning I woke up about
[30:27] two or three o'clock somewhere this
[30:28] morning it was just rain in like
[30:30] everything I laid there I said thank you
[30:32] Lord for the rain but you know what I
[30:34] was thinking for the rain because the
[30:37] pasture in front you know it needs to
[30:39] rain
[30:39] well you know everywhere else needed the
[30:42] rain see then he poured it out not just
[30:46] on my pasture and just dump the buckets
[30:48] you know and went out through the
[30:49] pasture and and said no he poured it out
[30:51] on all of this area no telling how far
[30:54] it went north east south and west of the
[30:56] rain coming because it support out upon
[30:59] all
[31:01] they the same rain that brings forth
[31:04] your corn that you've planted will also
[31:07] bring forth the briars and the thistles
[31:10] and the things in your garden that
[31:13] you've got a hole out right because
[31:16] that's that's what it's doing all right
[31:17] but now listen
[31:18] he said he'd pour out of him pour out
[31:23] his spirit when Azusa Street came into
[31:27] being now look some of you may not be
[31:29] familiar with that but it's the
[31:31] beginning of Azusa Street was the
[31:33] beginning of Pentecost in the last days
[31:34] their own in California all right and
[31:39] you have a lot of Pentecostal people
[31:42] still left around the world who go with
[31:44] that and thanks all right but that's
[31:46] that's the point that God poured out
[31:50] there on those people in spirit now you
[31:58] have to be real careful with it when God
[32:01] is pouring out his spirit because he
[32:04] would say I'll pour my spirit on all
[32:05] flesh he he doesn't make differences in
[32:13] his pouring out he pours it out on all
[32:16] all right now that can be very deceiving
[32:19] you say yeah but do you mean that that
[32:22] God would pour out his Spirit upon the
[32:26] false people he poured it out on the
[32:29] briars don't don't he pour the Rhine on
[32:31] the briars don't they pour the thing you
[32:34] say yeah but you sound like you're
[32:37] making God do something well I am I'm
[32:39] making him do what a word said he does
[32:41] all right let's just read something in
[32:44] the word going over to number 4 brothers
[32:47] will pick up Deuteronomy and let's just
[32:49] see what God says about what he'll do in
[32:56] this day of the false Christ then we get
[33:01] back to that in a minute and and
[33:02] determine the you got for a excuse me
[33:09] now listen if there arise among you a
[33:14] prophet or a dreamer of dreams and give
[33:18] it the assign or a wonder now we read in
[33:21] the Bible this is what we're supposed to
[33:23] be based on right scriptural then what
[33:27] and the sign are the Wonder come to Pais
[33:31] we're all he spake unto thee saying let
[33:35] us go after other gods which thou has
[33:42] not known and let us serve them now you
[33:48] listening signs and wonders to come to
[33:51] Pais great things to happen if there's
[33:56] anybody in the world today healed it
[33:58] what so eat of anything God done the
[34:00] healing right right come on then see
[34:07] look and I shalt not hearken unto the
[34:10] words of that prophet what if he take
[34:13] you to another God now look how easy it
[34:19] is Christ
[34:22] Antichrist that's how close it is now
[34:30] come on we'll get down to it in a minute
[34:33] that God poured out his spirit on all
[34:38] see the anointing comes from God Himself
[34:43] water
[34:44] I shall not hearken unto the words of
[34:47] that prophet or that dreamer of dreams
[34:49] for the Lord your God proved with you
[34:53] now listen he proved with you to know
[34:57] whether you love the Lord your God with
[35:00] all your heart with all your soul
[35:04] now he's gonna pour out things are gonna
[35:08] happen great signs and wonders by
[35:11] somebody coming and giving you a sign in
[35:12] other words some preacher come in here
[35:14] and he says we're gonna roll bout four
[35:16] caskets in here in a minute and we got
[35:18] four proven to be dead people and
[35:21] you know but I'm gonna go down and I'm
[35:23] gonna lay hands on them and and they're
[35:27] gonna raise up from the dead well that's
[35:31] good I mean you were to rejoice you know
[35:35] instead of looking at me and wonder
[35:37] what's going on you ought to be smiling
[35:38] to think that God would do those and you
[35:40] can know but what if he takes you to
[35:46] another god I remember my point keep it
[35:51] in mind
[35:52] Christ and Antichrist Antichrist is so
[35:56] close to Christ until it's just that
[35:59] little point you just added was not that
[36:02] what happened in the Garden of Eden was
[36:05] it not there that Satan just added one
[36:09] word to Eve and it caused all of this to
[36:13] break down there's you beginning of your
[36:15] Antichrist which Christ is the word
[36:17] right all right see then are you
[36:21] following me
[36:22] the point I'm trying to make somebody
[36:24] give you a great sign in wonder and it
[36:26] come to pies what are you gonna do well
[36:31] we got to believe that because this
[36:33] happened that happened and we've seen it
[36:34] three people raised the dead but what
[36:37] does it take you to another God what if
[36:41] they try to teach you something wrong in
[36:43] the Word of God now you've got a problem
[36:50] and God said or the dreamer dream before
[36:56] the lord god prove with you the three
[37:06] raises of the dead what are you gonna do
[37:09] you gonna follow down and worship that
[37:12] person you're gonna declare that person
[37:17] to be of some great authority from God
[37:21] then raise three from the dead I'm
[37:23] playing the language don't ask me to try
[37:28] don't don't go in the wrong direction
[37:30] either cuz we've seen the dead right so
[37:32] we're about to have
[37:34] we've seen that so don't worry about it
[37:37] the man raised up from the dead don't
[37:39] worry about it we've seen too much all
[37:40] right I'm not trying to do it that way
[37:42] I'm trying to get you to think think
[37:46] about the day in the hour that we're
[37:48] living in a deception that's in the land
[37:50] today and the things about the religious
[37:52] world of Christianity and how that
[37:56] there's 900 or more different
[37:58] denominations out of one Bible out of
[38:05] one Bible there's nine hundred and
[38:07] something different interpretations
[38:10] right not throwing no stones cause he
[38:13] who lives in the glass house he better
[38:15] be careful
[38:16] he don't want to throw stones he lives
[38:18] in Glass House what do you mean
[38:20] I mean we don't throw off on nobody we
[38:22] just try to tell it like it is
[38:24] the engines talking like it is in plain
[38:26] language all right the three raises from
[38:29] the dead what are you going to do he if
[38:39] he takes you to another God are you
[38:41] going to follow his teaching cause
[38:44] remember one thing we're talking about
[38:45] Christ remember a man in the Old
[38:48] Testament called Balaam you remember him
[38:52] Balaam could do all things that Moses
[38:58] and him could do there's nothing wrong
[39:03] with his anointing he even prophesied
[39:07] about the coming of the Lord
[39:10] Balaam with nothing wrong with the
[39:14] prophecy because he couldn't prophesy
[39:16] something contrary to the Word of God
[39:19] and be God's prophet and he was God's
[39:22] prophet he's here but he was Falk now
[39:24] that was made false when he faced stood
[39:26] up before Moses and Emlyn shoulder
[39:28] Elisha and then you come on down with
[39:30] all the other stories then he becomes
[39:32] and shows forth and proves he's what he
[39:34] is but just remember he was a prophet
[39:38] and what he prophesied is written in
[39:41] God's Word the yet is teaching
[39:47] his teaching was what was wrong right he
[39:52] talked to children of Israel to do
[39:54] things that was wrong
[39:56] Ricci Bible and this in doing those
[40:00] things he he took his rope to
[40:03] destruction yeah what he said was the
[40:08] truth
[40:09] there's your anointed ones Balaam could
[40:16] not say something wrong
[40:21] by the spirit now he could do it by his
[40:25] own self and teach the people wrong and
[40:26] he did but yet in the Holy Spirit if it
[40:30] spoke Balaam had to speak what the Holy
[40:32] Spirit how about who is it coughs the
[40:35] one that was the high priest when Jesus
[40:37] was there and Caiaphas prophesied and
[40:39] said it was necessary that one died for
[40:42] the sins of the people that was the
[40:44] anointing of the Holy Ghost on caucus
[40:46] and he was the guy that put Jesus on the
[40:48] cross
[40:51] come on read your Bible
[40:54] he was the guy that put him on the cross
[40:57] declara didn't seem forth but he'd
[40:59] already profits out it was necessary
[41:01] that one died for the sins of the people
[41:03] so if not they were gonna have it up
[41:04] rising on the insurrection was gonna
[41:07] take place
[41:07] so coughs was trying to solve it and he
[41:10] prophesied the very thing that would be
[41:14] happen that they'd take Jesus out and
[41:16] crucify him and they would not have an
[41:18] insurrection of the good you know in the
[41:20] land did the Christ and calf was cutting
[41:26] under that anointing then he could go
[41:29] out and do wrong and make the Sun but
[41:31] under that anointing of the Holy Spirit
[41:33] he could not say nothing except what God
[41:35] said come on go back to Balaam when he
[41:40] was told you know go ahead and do this
[41:41] he said I'll go over said I can only
[41:43] tell you what God tells me read your
[41:46] Bible I can only do what God says for me
[41:49] to do he was straight about it he knew
[41:53] what he was doing not away see because
[41:56] that anointing was on him
[42:02] and see you say you mean that that the
[42:05] Holy Spirit can be on somebody that's
[42:07] wrong like that I'll remind you of one
[42:11] thing in the Old Testament there was not
[42:14] anybody warned again wait a minute now
[42:19] what do you mean there was nobody
[42:20] born-again in the Old Testament Jesus
[42:22] Christ had to come and die to give his
[42:25] life to be able to release it to be able
[42:28] to save people there was nobody in the
[42:31] Old Testament saved under the basis of
[42:33] what we talk about salvation they didn't
[42:36] accept Jesus Christ as their Savior they
[42:38] rejected all of it down through there
[42:41] but you see the point anointed ones how
[42:49] are you gonna know the difference now
[42:54] remember we just read where God would
[42:59] send these among us to try you want to
[43:04] read it again that God would send this
[43:07] among us to try they got these things
[43:16] they call them out deprogram and you
[43:18] know they've they got you your program
[43:20] this way then they take you in deprogram
[43:21] you well that don't work too good with
[43:25] me no I hate how trouble finding my
[43:28] brain to be able to program it but you
[43:31] know but listen Church what I'm trying
[43:35] to get you to city that we read there in
[43:39] Matthew 24:24 that in the last days they
[43:42] would be false Christ's false Christ's
[43:49] it would be anointed people right Christ
[43:58] anointed people you see them in the land
[44:00] today look all across the land I'm gonna
[44:01] take it no I'm just telling yo you you
[44:04] got a mind you've been using it you know
[44:06] who's about their preaching and what's
[44:08] taking place you know Benny hen walked
[44:10] off the platform one day and walked
[44:12] right out in the congregation turn
[44:13] walk back we're not denying the truth of
[44:16] what's happened because the anointing is
[44:23] here if poured out its anointing its the
[44:28] Christ poured out it's him to bring
[44:31] forth but he wants to try people the
[44:34] Prophet said it like this one day he
[44:36] said he wants to prove that this bride
[44:38] won't fail like he did the Eve took
[44:42] Satan's word this shade one word he just
[44:48] said you shall not and she took that and
[44:56] it created all the havoc that we have in
[44:58] the world all the troubles is because of
[45:00] the fall in the garden how close is it
[45:06] to us then yes for brother Dale I know
[45:14] the Spirit of God I can just feel it you
[45:20] do you know what cuz you can just feel
[45:27] it well what if it don't speak according
[45:31] to the word what if it takes you to
[45:36] another God you got to admit the Trinity
[45:42] doctrine the God in three persons
[45:44] Blessed Trinity co-equal and coeternal
[45:46] something like that has deceived the
[45:49] religious world and brought it into
[45:51] their ranks brought it to their own
[45:57] people so there's no such thing as a
[46:02] trinity in the Bible short to me show me
[46:06] the word Trinity in the Bible it's not
[46:10] that that was taken it I can show you
[46:16] even in your we don't need to
[46:18] encyclopedias anymore okay the I used to
[46:22] say I can take your cuz I got a piece in
[46:24] my Bible here that I can show you where
[46:26] all
[46:27] look the water baptisms and things was
[46:29] changed by the Catholic Church we don't
[46:32] need no come don't need nothing doing
[46:34] that paperwork no more pop it in your
[46:36] cell phone right now type in Trinity in
[46:39] your cell phone you'll see where it
[46:41] comes up where it come from right
[46:45] it was established by the Catholic
[46:47] Church starting off at 325 AD that's the
[46:50] first Nazi in council what do you see in
[46:54] that form I'm saying it to show you what
[46:56] we're talking about if they take you to
[46:58] another God they take you to another
[46:59] teaching or another doctor in another
[47:02] point you got to stay with the word
[47:07] that's why all I ask
[47:09] show me in the Bible where anybody was
[47:11] ever baptized father son Holy Ghost I
[47:17] got away from them saying what he used
[47:19] to say cuz he used to say I'll give you
[47:21] ten thousand dollars you'll come short
[47:23] to me but they got so many perversions
[47:25] today till you know I got them the
[47:28] language is poverty they got all these
[47:29] things for verdict it better be careful
[47:31] I guess what we say but I'll just say it
[47:33] in plain language come show me the word
[47:35] Trinity in the Bible show me three
[47:37] guards in the Bible what's the first
[47:40] commandment hold all this with the Lord
[47:45] on the hardest one they've never been
[47:50] but one guard taught in the Bible and
[47:53] anybody teaching anything outside of
[47:55] that is an antichrist anti teaching and
[47:59] that's the point of what I'm getting at
[48:00] Deuteronomy says there's there's wonder
[48:04] it's and back over in Deuteronomy says
[48:07] if a prophet give you a sign that comes
[48:08] up I suppose to follow the Prophet
[48:12] that's Bob but here comes the
[48:18] understanding of what if he takes it to
[48:23] another God another teaching like I said
[48:26] there was nothing wrong with the
[48:29] anointing of Balaam I remember the
[48:32] Prophet talking about him one day and he
[48:33] said to be a prophet in Israel meant a
[48:35] lot you realize that I'm not a prophet
[48:38] in Lulla
[48:40] no problem I'm not supposed to be huh
[48:46] did you say what are you talking about
[48:48] don't don't tell me to bring signs and
[48:50] wonders of a prophet cuz i'm not in that
[48:52] class yet God has used this and done
[48:57] things but my point is what is that
[49:01] anointing that's on you what is it
[49:04] remember Satan can pass out supernatural
[49:07] gifts every day of his doing so don't
[49:10] put it on gifts don't say what brother
[49:13] Dale I know cuz see you say well I spoke
[49:15] in tongues I shouted I cried they do it
[49:20] the ballgame whole lot more than we do
[49:24] right they shout all over the place
[49:29] until they just go haywire they never
[49:35] didn't like me I told him adorable one
[49:39] day I said how come to me all the all
[49:40] with this ballgame stuff and all this
[49:42] volume stuff I said cheapest game you've
[49:44] ever heard his football one guy you know
[49:47] what he said the Falcons alone is worth
[49:51] billions of dollars I said will you
[49:53] answer me one question I said when they
[49:56] start the game what do they do
[49:58] three or four guys gets on one side
[50:00] three or four gets on the other side
[50:01] they'll up gets in the middle he takes
[50:03] out a quarter and he thumps the quarter
[50:06] up in the iron to see whether it lands
[50:09] on heads or tails and the rest of the
[50:11] game is hollering Hawk get the
[50:12] quarterback you get it rest of the game
[50:18] they holler and get the quarterback well
[50:20] if you can't afford to lose quarter now
[50:24] don't tell me how many pigeons you were
[50:27] sorry about that little something to
[50:30] break the the dead feeling off of you
[50:32] get you from smiling instead of frowning
[50:35] because you wondering what I'm doing
[50:36] what I'm doing there's one thing I'm
[50:38] trying to tell you one thing for sure
[50:41] the Bible drop
[50:44] right and it says in the life stage that
[50:48] would be false Christ the anointing now
[50:53] let's get to this serious part the
[50:55] anointing of Satan is great he can pass
[50:58] out gifts new things of his own remember
[51:04] the Bible called him The Anointed cherub
[51:05] who stood beside the Lord come on it was
[51:10] the anointed cherub he stood right
[51:11] beside the Lord he in other words he was
[51:13] God's right hand man until he fell well
[51:18] what you see the main thing is to get
[51:22] what we want a few minutes to this talk
[51:24] about that then it said there'd be false
[51:28] christs all right now was Balaam false
[51:35] no he was a genuine prophet until he
[51:45] faced a larger name he was a genuine
[51:47] prophet until he faced the word he was
[51:53] riding all the other things even his
[51:54] prophecy was right cause he spoke of the
[51:57] coming of the Lord in the last days
[52:00] right look how wonderful look at Moses
[52:08] with all the things they could do was he
[52:10] not anointed that true Moses was
[52:14] anointed but Balaam was anointed you
[52:20] can't go by the anointing or what you
[52:22] think about of the feelings and the
[52:24] things like that you can't go about one
[52:28] thing but the Word of God
[52:30] yeah but I felt it I I know I'm I know
[52:34] I've got the Holy Ghost I felt it was
[52:40] the Word made alive to you what about
[52:44] she the only way you will ever know the
[52:46] difference in the cross in the
[52:47] Antichrist is by the word check him out
[52:50] by the word what are you supposed to do
[52:51] I know where old Pentecostal seems to
[52:53] say you know they get and look each
[52:54] other in the face you know and I'm
[52:56] earning your spirit well that ain't no
[52:58] discerning no spirit cuz I don't work we
[53:01] just try somebody by the word you see I
[53:04] just flopped it out now to try the
[53:06] congregation to see whether you believe
[53:11] the Word of God or not do you believe in
[53:15] one true and living God in Jesus being
[53:18] his night because you don't your aunt
[53:21] across now I just flopped it out but
[53:27] let's see you come and take the Word of
[53:29] God and explain it of the Christ because
[53:38] that Christ is the genuine it's genuine
[53:44] it's the Christ
[53:46] it's the Anointed One he was the
[53:50] anointed one that was anointed with the
[53:52] anointing right cuz he was the Lord to
[53:55] Christ the Bible says but what about me
[54:01] and you you realize that baptism of the
[54:06] Holy Ghost that you received to give you
[54:08] the new birth putting you in the body of
[54:09] Christ makes you the Christ the Lord it
[54:18] makes you a child of God makes you the
[54:21] Christ and see by being the Christ then
[54:25] we have within us the very life of
[54:28] Christ and no wonder Paul could say the
[54:30] life that I now live in the flesh I live
[54:32] by the faith of the Son of God
[54:36] cuz he knew what was inside of him can
[54:43] we be deceived the real true pride can
[54:45] never be deceived to the point of being
[54:47] lost no that won't work you can't put it
[54:51] that way because it you'd make him
[54:53] giving you eternal life and taking it
[54:55] away but the Christ the Anointed One
[55:03] comes and lives in you and I in the new
[55:07] birth
[55:08] and we become little messiahs right he's
[55:13] the Messiah were the messiahís we're his
[55:15] children right don't think about it
[55:21] think about this Christ and remember the
[55:27] anointing that was on Balaam was genuine
[55:33] the anointing that was upon koffice was
[55:37] genuine there was not the devil's
[55:39] anointing it was a true genuine Holy
[55:43] Spirit now we're stepping up a life -
[55:46] you got to think a little bit with me
[55:51] Satan can do a lot of things but he
[55:54] can't be the Holy Ghost he can pass out
[56:00] gifts he can do all that but he cannot
[56:02] be the Anointed Christ
[56:09] it can't be I remember what we brought
[56:13] out the other day this will be for later
[56:14] in a message
[56:15] just remember anointed ones they are not
[56:23] sealed in the body of Christ only
[56:29] born-again believers are sealed into the
[56:31] body of Christ the difference between
[56:33] just being anointed or the Holy Spirit
[56:38] that's why Balaam could be anointing of
[56:40] the Holy Spirit and go out and do all
[56:41] the things wrong Catholics could declare
[56:44] Jesus Christ to be and have him killed
[56:47] but yet he was the anointing was right
[56:54] he's not it's not the fact that you are
[56:57] an anointed one that makes you saved
[57:00] oh we just said something didn't and now
[57:09] you're gonna have to explain it anointed
[57:13] ones are not sealed in the body of
[57:14] Christ because the anointing is on your
[57:18] spirit
[57:22] we'll get back to that later I don't
[57:24] want to get into it and talk much okay
[57:27] but think about it
[57:32] anointed ones we say Old Glory Aidan
[57:37] it's something that I feel the Spirit of
[57:40] God that's wonderful we should we should
[57:45] be happy we should rejoice right but
[57:50] just remember you can feel every bit of
[57:52] that and still not be right you can feel
[57:58] every bit of those things that still not
[57:59] be right well what do you how do you
[58:06] tell the difference by the word by the
[58:12] word right so what do we try each other
[58:19] by by the word what you should be trying
[58:21] me today is by wearing whether or not
[58:23] I'm staying with the word and if I'm not
[58:28] you come show me where I'm off that's
[58:31] the point is I can be open call see I'm
[58:37] not trying to be some kind of a Christ
[58:39] to lead you to an idea or a thought I'm
[58:43] trying to be a minister of the gospel of
[58:45] Jesus Christ and leads you to the word
[58:46] and unless you decide yourself
[58:53] remember it's left up to you whether or
[58:55] not it's the truth not left up to me
[58:58] it's not left up to where we could raise
[58:59] the dead it's not left up to worth that
[59:01] this could happen in that could happen
[59:04] cuz we just read in Deuteronomy what if
[59:06] God lets that happen he's doing it to
[59:11] tries to see who we are Percy if we will
[59:13] stay with his word where would evolve
[59:15] that word one word
[59:23] he turned down the word you just think
[59:29] about those Pharisees and Sadducees
[59:30] standing there before the Lord Jesus
[59:32] Christ which was according to John 1:14
[59:35] I'm limited in that he was the word made
[59:37] flesh and they crucified him right they
[59:50] killed the very Christ that they claimed
[59:52] that they were serving and claiming him
[59:54] to be
[59:55] they couldn't argue with him who was it
[59:59] Nicodemus he said we know that you're a
[1:00:03] teacher come from God we know but nobody
[1:00:06] can do the things you do read your Bible
[1:00:08] he said nobody can do the things you do
[1:00:10] without God being with him yet when he
[1:00:13] just said you must be born again
[1:00:17] Nicodemus just fell backwards and
[1:00:19] Senator understands you you mean I got
[1:00:22] to go back to my mother's womb come back
[1:00:24] out of my mother's womb you know to be
[1:00:26] born again Jesus said if I speak to you
[1:00:28] of heavenly thing or earthly things and
[1:00:30] how can you do it you said you can't
[1:00:32] understand heavenly Nicodemus wanted to
[1:00:39] talk to God he came to him to see him
[1:00:42] and talk with him but yet he turned down
[1:00:46] the word because he admitted the
[1:00:50] anointing was right come on what is it
[1:00:57] to be then according to Matthew 24:24
[1:00:59] then in the last days that be Christ's
[1:01:01] false Christ the anointing is not false
[1:01:08] look at this for a second and we'll quit
[1:01:10] the anointing that's on Balaam was not
[1:01:13] false it was a genuine anointing of the
[1:01:15] Holy Ghost the same anointing that was
[1:01:21] on Balaam was on Elijah that anointing
[1:01:29] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's
[1:01:31] the new birth of who else is not we need
[1:01:33] we don't need this to be anointed of son
[1:01:35] spirit
[1:01:37] we need to birth of that spirit within
[1:01:40] our heart
[1:01:44] see those Old Testament Saints they
[1:01:46] couldn't go no further than the point of
[1:01:48] just having a point of believing in it
[1:01:50] and being anointed to that because Jesus
[1:01:53] Christ had not come and died in their
[1:01:54] stead but that's no excuse now for me
[1:01:57] and you are we just anointed ones well
[1:02:08] brother Gary Atkins sister say it like
[1:02:11] this he said brother Dale he said me and
[1:02:13] you are not too much of knowing at Arwa
[1:02:16] I said I have to agree we what's your
[1:02:23] point you mean the devil and his
[1:02:25] children can outshine the bride across
[1:02:28] it's getting pretty close but you see
[1:02:39] now here is the point we'll get to the
[1:02:41] two anointed ones as I said they're not
[1:02:45] sealed in the body
[1:02:47] they're just anointed on there spirit
[1:02:48] and we do back to that later
[1:02:51] it's just anointed on their spirit
[1:02:54] because you're a body spirit soul you're
[1:02:57] three rim person or whatever you are see
[1:02:59] you know you've got these parts that
[1:03:03] works for this and what works with it
[1:03:05] body see taste feel smell in here then
[1:03:08] spirit memory reason conscience
[1:03:10] affections and things like that working
[1:03:11] with that inside of you there's a soul
[1:03:14] that's in demand which is not in the
[1:03:15] animal that's why the animal cannot be a
[1:03:17] living soul God breathed into the
[1:03:22] nostrils of Adam and he became a living
[1:03:24] soul he didn't breathe into the animals
[1:03:28] and let him become a living soul no he
[1:03:31] just breathed life he gave them life
[1:03:34] that's the difference in a dog in a
[1:03:35] human being a human being as a soul
[1:03:38] whereas a dog or a cat or something it's
[1:03:42] just a life
[1:03:45] not a soul the soul is your being who
[1:03:49] you are all right I don't want to be
[1:03:52] anointed in my spirit I want that to be
[1:03:56] genuine anointing on your spirit is no
[1:04:01] difference in owning on any anointed
[1:04:03] that's the point of getting it doesn't
[1:04:07] matter whether you are born-again
[1:04:08] Christian or non born-again Christian
[1:04:10] the anointing is the same its anointing
[1:04:15] on your spirit right
[1:04:19] it's anointed in that spirit realm to do
[1:04:22] and to to worship and to rejoice and
[1:04:25] have a great time of serving God in that
[1:04:27] spirit realm but if that's all we do
[1:04:30] then we're no different than Balaam and
[1:04:31] kai force or anybody else then really
[1:04:36] we're not much better than a dog though
[1:04:40] the dog won't lie here and killed like
[1:04:42] humans do but now listen anointed ones
[1:04:48] is what the scripture calls them it
[1:04:53] calls them false Christ because of
[1:04:56] something being wrong with that person
[1:04:59] and what is wrong what was wrong with
[1:05:02] Balaam his doctrine what was wrong with
[1:05:06] Caiaphas his doctrine all the rest of it
[1:05:12] was great line you think Bailey you
[1:05:15] think Catholics didn't believe in in God
[1:05:17] you think he didn't believe in the
[1:05:19] anointing thing he didn't believe in all
[1:05:21] of the great thing but by believing in
[1:05:27] all of that put him in a dangerous
[1:05:28] position because we got to go further
[1:05:33] than just in her anointing well brother
[1:05:37] Dale I'm satisfied with the anointing
[1:05:38] you you seem to like this you don't like
[1:05:40] hey don't talk to me about anointing
[1:05:43] okay I've been around too long I've seen
[1:05:47] God I've seen the dead raised I've
[1:05:49] smelled God been in his presence inside
[1:05:51] so don't talk to me about those things
[1:05:53] it's done too late I'm sorry you don't
[1:05:56] talk to me come and talk to him about
[1:05:57] the word
[1:06:03] just remember before you forget it you
[1:06:09] say will God permit these things to
[1:06:12] happen to try us yes he will permit us
[1:06:19] to be tried the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:25] according to the Bible wasn't tried as
[1:06:26] we are he was tried he he wouldn't put
[1:06:34] no special cubicle or a spot and moved
[1:06:37] out and said he's the stage there he
[1:06:39] doesn't know he was fighting off his
[1:06:40] whole life he was fighting the whole
[1:06:44] time he was here it cost him his life
[1:06:52] but you see anointed ones is the genuine
[1:06:56] if we'll get back to it into the message
[1:06:58] we're going on only wanted a genuine
[1:07:00] anointing on your spirit and you're
[1:07:06] still not born again that's hard and
[1:07:12] they be stumbling to some but just don't
[1:07:14] stumble just think about it and come
[1:07:17] back let's talk about it because that
[1:07:20] anointing can be on your spirit and you
[1:07:24] can shout speak in tongues glory
[1:07:25] hallelujah do all kind of things great
[1:07:28] things can take place and it's an
[1:07:30] anointing on your spirit it's anointing
[1:07:38] just on your spirit doesn't mean you're
[1:07:39] born again brother Brown said you can
[1:07:42] have the baptism the Holy Ghost everyday
[1:07:43] life and dying go to hell that we
[1:07:46] believe that you better start thinking
[1:07:49] about the norwich one to the fish some
[1:07:51] statements in her that he's made that
[1:07:53] we're gonna claim to be the truth think
[1:08:01] on these things
[1:08:03] anointed ones that even that anointing
[1:08:09] is true yet the person could be false
[1:08:13] right for a person themselves to be
[1:08:20] false and anointing to be true like on
[1:08:29] these things
[1:08:30] come on musicians I want you to just be
[1:08:34] concerned enough to think on yourself is
[1:08:39] that anointing on me and brother Dale
[1:08:43] was talking to her minute ago he made a
[1:08:45] statement and I still keep making that
[1:08:47] statement the same anointing that noise
[1:08:49] anybody else annoys you there's Ness
[1:08:52] there's not but one babe there's not but
[1:08:54] one anointing that's why the anointing
[1:08:59] is genuine the teaching can be false and
[1:09:09] being false in it proves what we are
[1:09:11] because we will decide whether or not we
[1:09:13] accept the word can we say truly the
[1:09:16] word is the word and say this is it
[1:09:22] anointed once we can just be anointed
[1:09:26] with on on our spirit and not be born
[1:09:28] again Christian but don't forget this
[1:09:32] statement anointed ones are not sealed
[1:09:35] in anointed ones that this is like the
[1:09:42] anointing of that that's not that don't
[1:09:43] seal you in the body of Christ then
[1:09:48] anoint your spirit the baptism of the
[1:09:53] Holy Ghost is what seals us then and
[1:09:55] that's in the soul that's not in your
[1:09:57] spirit yet it can be so close what do we
[1:10:05] do with it we have to judge it by the
[1:10:07] word now I go back to for a second or
[1:10:10] what if he comes and he gives you a
[1:10:12] sound and it comes to Paes and he takes
[1:10:15] you to another God
[1:10:16] believe him he takes you to another
[1:10:19] doctor and another idea that's contrary
[1:10:21] to the Word of God don't believe it cuz
[1:10:25] he said I have sent this among you to
[1:10:27] try you to see whether or not you'll
[1:10:30] stay with the word false Christ the
[1:10:37] anointing is not false it can be the
[1:10:42] genuine Holy Ghost himself he follows do
[1:10:49] we want to call it false anointed ones
[1:10:51] the mornings not fog the morning is
[1:10:54] genuine but the person will be
[1:11:00] determined by what to do with the word
[1:11:01] let's stand together
