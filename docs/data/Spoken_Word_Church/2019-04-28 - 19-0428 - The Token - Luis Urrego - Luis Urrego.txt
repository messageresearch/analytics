========================================

what comes to your mind oh well we got but but that's what sinks that's that's uh it's just uh you know you're not going to be deceived about a Baptist in this day you're not gonna be deceived you're not going to be deceived by by by Pentecostal you remember brother bang talk about the two spirits in the framework of the church the two spirits almost alike so hard to to to to to differentiate but what was that what was the diff what mean the difference was the light the token right so the children of Israel they had to grab this blood from the lamb and place it on the doorpost right so it wasn't the lamb itself for the brand said was not the token the token was the blood right but really in actuality wasn't the blood it was the life the life because that blood you can have the blood all you want to as well you could have they could have had that blood all they want to but it's the life that had comes back upon the believer that changes who you see Jesus Christ rogram said Jesus Christ spilled all his blood spilled all the blood and there was only enough blood to just go for for a certain amount of people it wouldn't been able to cover everybody right in his physical element you see but that's the reason why I said one when go Terry II upon a day in the upper room that was the message go that was a message to them go eat tarry in the upper room and there you'll be in dwell with the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost there the comforter will come you see that is the that is the element that I believe people are missing in this day they're looking they're looking at they're looking at the physical things and forgetting that there's a life that needs to be lit you see so it's making people it's making people lazy and drowsy and nonchalant when in actuality these do you see how they had to act in the before this exodus they had to move you know they had to do something about this message that Moses and Moses gave them you see they had to act upon it right so let me go back to you come on oh this real quick so just real quick so what is a token it's a thing serving as a visible or tangible representation of a fact quality feeling excetera then give an example here I wanted to offer you a small token of my appreciation well when you give somebody a gift for example I give brother Bob this gift I appreciate for the bob now I gave rather Bob that gift but that's not me that's not me but it's a representation both of my appreciation to him so every time he looks at that token it should remind him of me right use your own sanctity so every time you look at the token amen the holy ghost working in a believers life or in your life and should point you back to Christ you shouldn't point you back to a man right it shouldn't point you back to a tape they shouldn't point you back to something physical all those things were good those were tokens amen to us you see but that that's not Christ again like I said the tape didn't die for me it was Christ that died for me amen Brian said here now what is first a token it's a word that's commonly used among we english-speaking people especially here in America token is a really that they're the dictionary says that a token is a sign it's a sign of a fair price paid see that the fair or price required price that's been paid I give you an example in Toronto when we go and get on the subway they don't use money order for you to get on the subway you have to have paid your fare and they give you these tokens and that's what you present to the person that's letting you in that's gonna let you in into the subway and if you don't have that token even though I got money I'll give you some money well that's not gonna work I got the Bible I've got the message I've got the picture of the Statue of a perfect man I've got I've got it all but that's not enough you got to have the talk right you've got to have that the representation of the life of what that is you see you have to have that life and that's what's gonna let you in God's not gonna look at you because you have you've listened to every single message that brother brown agrees or it's great that you do it's great that you read and you continue to do it over and over and over but that won't save you that's not gonna that's gonna save you it'll save you if you dress what the Prophet was talking about in those tapes and applied to your life that's what's gonna save you see so the children of Isreal they had this token they had the blood amen but they then they had the land and so in another place you know they in that the covenant of circumcision was given to them before Moses told him to go and and in apply the blood and on all this like this now what if a man would come up to Moses and say look I don't need to do that I've got circumcision I could show you I never would have been enough even though it was part of God's it was part of God's covenant that he had given to Abraham that would not have been enough that was not the token the token was that blood on the on the doorpost and Saints that blood why is it on the on the house because that house represents you you're you we are the body of Christ I see that that token has to be placed on your on your home you see it has to be on display there the letter there's no hey Christ was in here yes right yeah there's gonna be certain things that are gonna they're gonna come there was physically if we continue reading they're an exodus when we don't have know how much more time but we continue reading there there are other things that they had to do in order for them to prepare them for the journey they have to were they had to shop how shoes on while they were eating the lamb while they were eating the lamb they have to have shoes on in other words but coming to the Lord is soon at hand we need to be ready right right we need to be ready that was another the fact that they believed that message was the fact that they were acting upon the message in all those different areas but that was that blood showed that that lamb took my place and then that lamb dwells here and then they they had to eat all of the lamb like sister Paige said they had to leave that D all of the lamb including the entrance the heart the guts the brain everything kittens liver every single thing well I don't like that part of pres nasty they have to eat it all I like the way brother Sutton said preaches he steps on my toes too much I don't like what he says but is it the word that's the thing is it the word because if it's the word and it's not off the word you have to eat that right you see you have to in order in order you cuz you the body of Christ has to feed on all the work Amen praise God so the blood of the lamb was the token for Israel and program says here to the world it's a bunch of foolishness but to God it's the only way the only thing that he requires is that token it must be there and you cannot have the token until the ferret is paid so Jesus Christ paid the fare for us right then you are a possessor of the token which gives you the privilege of a free pass I'll see the blood I'll pass over you what a time that that what a privilege to know that you packed within you the pass when I see the blood I'll pass over you it's the only thing that he will recognize it's the only thing that you'll recognize God didn't give any other or any other substitution for the token it's nothing else that can take its place no substitute no denomination no nothing else it takes that God said that alone will I see so others are trying to put other things into place you see and that's what happened in the Garden of Eden the Adam and Eve when when when they had to do with with a life right it was they they sinned and then they try to put in a substitute something that was easy something that was simple you see but that God had to provide himself a lamb you see God had to give them the lamb amen and say put those skins on don't put that way I don't want your your your religion I don't like it I can't stand it I don't want you to be to be colored by that I want you to be covered by this and there was blood involved with that two things so does anybody have any comments or any questions it occurred to me while you're talking almost countries in Asia at least before you go into somebody's house remove your shoes so it just kind of struck me when it said super shoes or while you're eating that was part of the armor the armor the whole armor of God yes that's right I mentioned that when I was in Toronto a couple of weeks ago I I was mentioning that and I told them I said all the Filipinos here because there's a lot of Filipinos there at the church Oh Filipinos here they look they just take they love taking off their shoes as a custom to take off your shoes when you go into a house but they're in Canada a lot of people do it anyways because the there's salt on the roads it's just nasty and you don't want to go in the house so so but I said in this case in this case they had their shoes on rather Brad said you know he just come to tell us the word it was thrilled not give it a roll I should tell us the Revelator we got get drilling but what are the people gonna do when it says the Bible says the fivefold ministry will affect the same I'm a perfectionist hide you get so that there's really saying that but cut brother bronsted at the back home magically perfect assignment so they're really saying you did you didn't really tell us the word because they saying that that's not right five minutes so it's a it's unfortunate its segment perfect for a Sunday School lesson I'm sort of Church and brother branham big brother Ben questions an answer for the rim says you're perfectly by the Holy Ghost but really that's the hot that's all you try some from a naked man I got their folk that's all I don't like but really an actuality you take redness both things together it's the Holy Ghost and they're awful just like it's not just a lot of the ministry is sound just why brother others don't enough so you can't put faith that God can speak through human flesh and yeah cuz you can't see past this veil with all its faults and failures that the God that created all the things that stuck through Brennan can speak through us that's absolutely there's a quote that I wanted to read to you I don't have time but brother barely mentions that he says he says we don't have faith of the minister cannot help you I cannot even help you if you don't have faith in what I'm telling you since right right so therefore if you already come with your mind insane I I don't I I listen to the tapes that's the voice for my day and when you come to church and you're listening to the minister it's coming but it's just kind of hit you know and you're not going to be able to get what is being preached because you already put a filter there yes these are his words bourbon you will become what you pay attention if it is repetitive and if it does if that didn't work then marketing wouldn't work you custom to here commercial over and over and then when you hear the jingle somewhere yeah they reminds you of that coffee thank you the best part of waking up true absolutely that's absolutely right and then and that that's the because you have to you have it has to agree with in a word that you have received as well and you see not just because well you know he said it and that that must be it but that's the things things do you know it for yourself whether Dale probably has had lots of things for many years do you know it for yourself about Ron do you know that where he got that from you see which is investigating the Bible listen to the tapes that's right I mean I hear some ministers when they preach I'm scared that they discount bella rhythms so I'm you know are the food their wording that I'm scared that young couples you know coming here that bait makes the oh right they don't have to listen to the tape yeah and you can't do that and another thing is there's a balance we are so fortunate to have the ministry we have here but what about people that go to that church you know what about I mean they like she said they believe with them and we're really blessed but you gotta find someone Holly goes just got a late June which goes back to have you read the Bible is mistake if you don't have you a church to go to you better be listening to those teams consistently neither that mean your church I'm in being better but when you got a church to go to services both morning and evening you decide to stay at home when you know the words going forth that's between you and God but you know people must not think because with those two quotes that you said with two different sentences what do they mean if you believe in a prophet you truly believe you would have to think about because the word says it obviously and then the Prophet he spoke about it you know bring the balance of that so let's go ahead thank you over here [Music]
