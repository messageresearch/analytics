chapter 22 I know many are out sick and different things and I know I also got a I also got a pop up a prayer request on my phone I mean a few minutes ago for her brother in Australia that I used to and he said that the wildfires are just about on his family's property so let's just give the Lord in prayer before we get in the scripture well God we're so grateful to be able to gather around you were denied and look into the scripture and see more of you Lord and I pray God that you'll strengthen your people tonight or Jesus help me Lord that I might get out of the way Lord Jesus that you could say something worthwhile Lord God that Lord wouldn't the people leave the night Lord Jesus he'll go back to their home strength and then with something that they might overcome the temptations of this life and that the things of this world or God and I pray Lord God at night Lord if you'll remember brother Simon down there across it on the other side of the world Lord and his family and turn the turn the blow that fire away from his house Lord Jesus we know that you're still a prayer answering God and you're still able to come upon this evil God and we know Lord God that we have a special access as your bride to you Lord Jesus because we have a revelation sure of who you are and who we are in this hour that we're living in you know we just call upon the name of the Lord of our brother Lord Jesus and for all of the states that are missing absent tonight that are sick and afflicted and all the different things that up to befall in your people or God we ask Lord that you remember them Lord Jesus Lord God we just open up our hearts and our minds the night Lord Jesus and we pray that you'll feel welcome to come and walk the aisles with us tonight Lord Jesus Lord that you'll just quicken the word as we hear it or God and open open our hearts Lord Jesus we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen let's go to Exodus chapter 12 every time I get up here I have to magnify the words a little bit more we're getting older there you go I'm gonna take this off we're supposed to be we're supposed to have Liberty right and it says Exodus chapter 12 verses three to eleven speaking unto all the congregation of Israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for an house and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next under his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb right then we'll go over to Isaiah chapter 22 first 22 and and I was gonna read Jeremiah so y'all can pop that down to the next screen but we'll stop at how Isaiah 22 and the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and no knee shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open you may be seated the Lord out his blessing to the reading of the word maybe a little odd combination of their scriptures tonight but what I wanted to talk about is the key to overcome the key to overcoming and you know if you can get access to the key if you can understand what the key is to overcoming in this life then then it'll give you strength in this out will give you something that you can use to combat the devil in this day that we're living in and that scripture in Exodus is kind of a strange I think made a strange little thing to kind of start with the night because really it's speaking of a people that were in natural bondage that they could look around and there were obviously an enslavement they they were forced to make bricks every day and forced to do manual labor and forced to work with without straw and all the different requirements that we know of from from from from reading and from my parents telling us all these stories and but you know tonight many of us many many people may be sitting here tonight are in spiritual enslavement where the devil has got you so bad on its so called up in the things of this world and so bogged down in life that you're you're actually in in bondage and and you know on the way over to church tonight brother Zack was was he said let's listen to Romans chapter six we began to listen to that and it began to speak about how that that you we were we were once slaves but now through Christ he has given us liberty to come out of that enslavement he's through through being identified at his death we have come into life and so you see if we could find that key if we could find a way to escape out of bondage it'll it'll give us power over all these things that that beset us so tonight you might you might say well I'm miserable I'm unsatisfied I know I'm thirsting for something and you might be bound by sin but there is a key of deliverance there is something that can set you free that can open up the prison bars that can open up the the open up that the gates of that prison house that you're in and I read maybe some scriptures like Isaiah chapter 22 and the key of the house of David which you know you could almost suspect maybe that tonight we might get so deep that you're you'd get a migraine and I don't intend to get really deep tonight I just want to preach maybe just kind of get back to the basics tonight the basics of salvation what it is to be a Christian what it is to have deliverance what it is to why we even want to be a Christian tonight why would we want to be why would we want to serve the Lord and I believe I believe that we should we should be able to come to a place where we want to serve the Lord so much to you you fall in love with the Lord so much that we're not serving God because we to get a place in heaven or hell or to get some reward like that but we're serving I'm serving Jesus tonight because I'm in love with Jesus we certainly serve Him not because we're forced to do it because there's a book of rules or something but because we're loved with God and I believe that tonight if you could fall in love with God so much that you're willing to do whatever it takes you're willing to obey His commandments you're willing to get on your knees and pray all night you're willing to study and get in the word I believe that that's the kind of relationship that God desires for his people is to not do things out of hate and do things out of a requirement but do things because you love the Lord Jesus you see there's a there's a problem the problem the reason why many of us are in bondage and are held in change of captivity by the devil is because there's a problem and if we could identify the problem first of all then we can identify what the solution is and the problem is the problem is that every one of us down on the inside of you you have a soul and that soul is the thing that carries you one way or the other even though you may not be able to really really even identify it right now as you're sitting in this congregation you can look and you could touch her your skin and you can you can feel you could remember things and you can kind of be aware of your spirit as you reason and you remember but wait out on the inside of that man down at the very bottom is your soul is the thing that carries you that will carry you down or carry you up you're the problem that we have if we have a problem tonight is that you have a heart that needs to be changed the problem is your heart and you know the Bible says that man will do whatever is in their heart whatever is in your heart is the thing that will cause you to go this way or that way the thing that will cause you to desire evil or to call you to desire good that will cause you to love the Lord or cause you to love the world it's that thing way down on the inside and you need deliverance you need that the problem that we have is that that heart needs to be changed you see the Word of God is what discerns the heart and Jeremiah chapter 17 verse 9 it says the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it the heart is so deceitful that you could be sitting here today thinking that because you pay your tithes or because you're in the Lula Assembly or brother Dale is your pastor because you're sitting here in a message church that you are right but the heart is deceitful you can be deceived by those things because your heart can still be not be filled with the presence of the Living God and you will be deceived and I wanted maybe tonight to share with you how you can not be deceived how to know whether you've got the real genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost or not because we'll see what when when you understand what the answer what the remedy is then you can understand your condition in this hour the Bible says in Jeremiah Jeremiah chapter 17 verse 10 I the LORD search the heart I try the reigns even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings in other words the Lord is constantly examining your motives the thing that drives you down on the inside to see what is causing you to act and do the way that you that you are and what is the way that God deserves the Bible says that the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart do you realize that when you come and sit in the sanctuary of the Lord and the word goes from over the pulpit the word is actually discerning what is in your heart you'll sit there and you'll say well I don't believe that or I reject that or you'll maybe even feel a little bit nervous a little bit shaky I wonder if that Minister is preaching on me tonight I wonder if he's talking to me well maybe the minister doesn't even know what in the world your situation is but yet the word is going forth and it's discerning the thoughts and intents of your heart the word is what what God uses to measure you remember the measuring line that zerubabbel used to build the temple he took them at the plumb line and he measured the temple he measured this construction work against the word he compared it with the word and that's what we're doing tonight we're comparing our lives we're looking into the edge of the scripture and as a mirror that the Bible says to see how our lives are measure up because how will you know how the only way that you can know what is down on the inside of your soul is to compare it with the word the the heart is deceitful the heart will deceive and make you think that everything's alright because you you got maybe all the examples that we've used before paving the parking lot and putting a roof on the church and all the good things playing in being a musician and in the church band and all of those things all of those things are are wonderful and needful but they are there will come to naught at the end of the road if you don't have the life of Christ on the inside to bear record for you to testify you to to make an atonement for you to purge you of all your sins the 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 verse 15 and 16 it says but even under this day when Moses is rare the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it when it the heart when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away if your heart will turn to the Lord then the veil over your eyes will be taken away and you'll be able to see Jesus for who he really is you know we think we think if we can if we can just be good if we can just get if we can just get people to wear a longer dress or if we the women to wear a longer dress if we can just get them to look different that will change things if we can just get somebody maybe if we can just shut down all the cigarette factories if we can shut down all the alcohol factories if we can pass all these laws so that you can't sell marijuana or LSD or all these different things in the street then that will change things but the problem tonight is not the laws of the land and all these different kind of things the problem is your heart that is the problem the Bible says now the Lord is that spirit and whether Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord and David said in Psalm 139 verse 23 to 24 he said cirques me O God and know my heart fry me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting I wonder tonight if there's any Christians here that are really desiring for God to search them and try them and see if there's anything any incorrect motive in their life and to probe deep and find out you know image to the point where you're not afraid for your your dirty laundry to be aired for everything there just to be made open for you to cuz I believe I believe when God gets ahold of a person's life and changes them and changes their whole direction then now you've got a testimony you've got you've got something that you can share with people and say I once was like this and now I'm like this and maybe that's one thing I want to declare up to all the young people tonight is that pretty much all the older ones in this building all right we could go around and point out different examples of people we we once were lost in seeing every person in here has a story every person has a testimony where we're not just a bunch of goody two-shoes I don't believe that God wants a bunch of good Christians he doesn't want good people he wants people that have been changed by the Holy Ghost by the power of God in their life and if God can change my life if he could change by the way his life if he can change by the Tonys life if he can change by the John's life he can change your life too we've got all these testimonies of people whose lives have been changed tonight and he can do the same thing for you we don't need to be good we need to be Christian you know you remember the stories about all the all the people in the Old Testament who gave God just a little bit of their life Samson he gave God his his faith in his gift but he wouldn't give God his heart he gave his heart to Delilah but he wouldn't give God his whole heart and and about Saul who who failed to just completely destroy the Amalekites because he failed to give God his whole heart then you've got people like David who gave their gave their whole heart to God but yet yet they would slip up every now and then they would slip up in big major ways you see the problem tonight is our heart if you've got a real genuine converted heart and you slip up and fall you're gonna go run right back to Jesus and say Lord forgive me I messed up save me repair of what I've done and and the Bible says that he's just and able to forgive you of your sins if you'll just ask him ELISA the problem the problem tonight is our heart it's the one that's sitting in your seat warming your seat tonight it's not the one sitting next to you it's not the one behind the pulpit it's not your pastor tonight it's not the song leader the problem is not your friends and it's not your parents many times we think the problem is our parents if our parents would raise us a little bit different and all this kind of thing but you remember the Bible tells us of a little boy named Josiah who was raised by ungodly parents but when he came of age they put a crown on his head and he said I'm going to serve the Lord that I've heard about listen we can there's many things that we can blame the night but the problem the problem is our own heart we are the harder problem if we could change the way if we could change our hearts tonight then we could change the church the whole church would change if we could get a heart change but we just many times we just settle for being good I don't want to settle for being good tonight the Bible says in Ephesians chapter 6 verse 2 to 4 it says honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou may'st live long on the earth and you father's provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord and I believe that the nurture and admonition of the Lord is not to train our children just to be goody two-shoes I don't want my children to be goody two-shoes where they're just going around faking a good Christian life then when they come to church they put on a big show and then when they go off with some buddies somebody can't see then they are totally different I want my children to be saved and saved and and I believe tonight that the nurture and admonition of the Lord is not just telling them to put on a show but actually loving them and being salty in front of them and letting them know that when they're when they go to bed at night that you're praying for them they can hear your prayers through the house that you have a Bible study with them you're bringing them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord but cause you're bringing them up in a way the way that they should go and that way is to love the Lord God with all their heart and with all their soul and not just to be good people I believe we've got enough good people to fill it filled with many churches around the world today we don't need any more good people we need change people Matthew chapter let's go to Matthew chapter 19 and we'll find out what good people is Matthew chapter 19 verse 16 it says and behold one came and said unto him good master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life and first of all he was coming to him thinking with all this goody-two-shoes non-seeing it's good and master good master what good thing shall I do what thing can I do that that would be really good that would warrant me eternal life and he said unto Him why call us down me good in other words you don't know what you're talking about you don't know whether I'm good or not you're just trying to try to talk up to me trying to try to get on my good side there is none good but one that is God and if there's none good but one then that's the one that you need inside to change you there's none good but one that is God but if thou will enter into life keep the commandments and he said unto Him hey he's still he's still babbling well I want to be good I'm having a problem with the thing that that being just good is not the thing that will give me eternal life he sat on him which jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself the young man said on him all these things have I kept from my youth up what like I yet what he lacked was to have a heart that was willing to make the sacrifice to do whatever it took Jesus did not care about his money he don't care about your ties tonight he don't care about it in that way but you paid ties as a scriptural obligation because it's a requirement from God that if you'll give your tithes into the storehouse you'll get a reward back but God doesn't need your money he didn't need this man's money what he needed from him was to soften up his heart and give his heart wholly to God so that he was willing to part with whatever God required of him jesus said unto them if thou will be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give it to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me listen you may be a keeper of the law tonight but have you fully surrendered your whole heart to God have you fully given over everything to God at you have you got to a place where you're just willing to lay everything out where where you don't care what people think about you where you don't care if people will mock you because of the things that you used to do you don't care if people will mock you because of the change that God has wrought in your life come to a place where you're willing to get down in the mud and the muck and the mire say God do something with me and change my life so that you could use me so that you can produce something glorious in my life the Bible says Hebrews in Hebrews chapter three verses 8 to 13 harden not your hearts as in the provocation and the day of temptation and the wilderness when your father's tempted me proved and saw my works 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always err where in their heart and they have not known my ways because they were not willing to give their heart fully to God so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed brethren lest there be any of you an evil heart of unbelief and departing from the Living God but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness and so I exhort you tonight tonight I exhort you to not be hard-hearted to be zealous toward the Lord your God why because in Psalms chapter 51 David said for thou desirest God he knew that God did not desire sacrifice what God was really after was the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart O God that will not despise could you could you imagine if you we'll just conceptualize for a moment meditate on this on this thought that what God the sacrifice is that God is really after as a heart that's so Torah they're so broken and beat down and you're just so fed up with the world that you're ready to just lay everything aside and say God filled me with your Holy Ghost give it to me Lord listen tonight if there's a heart problem there's got to be a heart solution so now I want to shift over and talk about that because the heart solution is the key the key to overcoming the key to access into the throne room the key to access to every promise of God tonight and listen tonight I believe that I've got something to share with you tonight so don't enter into the slumber awake thou that sleepest Oh wake up rise up because I've got a message for you tonight I've got a message of cheer that will help you so don't be quickly - close your eyes tonight maybe if I yell it loud enough that you won't fall asleep how could you fall asleep well just as we get to the key of the overcomer the thing that will give you power to overcome the devil then you begin to enter into the Land of Nod [Laughter] listen we were reading in Exodus at the book of Exodus about how they they took the lamb inside inside of their house they brought the lamb and they began the requirement to a message from from the prophet of the day had gone out to take the lamb and kill it and put the blood over the little of your door then bring that lamb on the inside of your house on the inside of your house and tonight tonight the inside of your house is at this house this house is that is the house that you're supposed to bring the lamb into so if you want to know what the key is the key is a very mysterious thing the key is a thing Abel was the first person in the Bible that's recorded to have a revelation of what this key was and if you go all the way back you listen let's go all the way back and look at the key that Abel found the key to this into the throne room of God because you see when Adam and Eve were ejected from from the from the Garden of Eden they were put out that the cherubim stood there in the end the garden to guard the way back to the Tree of Life and they stood there and I imagine Abel would be looking there thinking how how can I get back into fellowship with God how can my fellowship how could my access to him be restored and he would sit there on the hill maybe maybe let's let's put it personal tonight maybe many of you tonight are thinking I know that there is a God I know that he's real I've been to camp meetings I've been to services well I felt his presence I know that he's real but yet I wonder I questioned if I really have access to him and maybe Abel was sitting on that hill thinking I wonder how I can have access to him and then all of a sudden God began to spoke speak to him and quicken the word that he had already heard from his dad he shared with him the things that he had heard his daddy explained to him but it quickening him and he realized all of a sudden maybe he heard a lamb bleating because you see the key to access back into the throne room of God in the fellowship with him tonight the key is that you must have a lamb Abel needed a lamb and he knew that the process for getting back into fellowship with God is that lamb had to die and he took a knife or a rock or whatever it was all bloody and and I didn't you see he came Kings eyes were veiled to what that key was Cain could not see what that key was that that the lamb was the access the lamb was the way back and I wonder when they were down in Egypt land if there were many Egyptians and all of the people all around the surrounding all the people that were painting that blood over the lintels of their door if they began to laugh and scoff and say like Cain dear that's not the key that's not the right way to do it but it was the right way to do it and see they were they were killing a an actual lamb back then but it spoke of something that happened to thousands of years that God would give his life on the cross for you and I because you see we needed a lamb - without that lamb you would not you would not be able to have access back into the throne room the whole scripture speaks of this labrum needed a lamb when he was going up the mountain with Isaac and Genesis chapter 22 he said and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering you see how he spoke prophetically that he would provide himself a lamb the key the key to getting access to God the key the key to being able to approach to God is that lamb and if you go back into the Old Testament and and look how Paul explained that situation he started in Hebrews 11 he began to say unable by faith able by faith in that lamb and then he jumps he skips over and he begins to talk about Enoch because that little bit of faith that he had in that lamb unfolded and unfolded unfolded until Enoch was able to take a body change based upon what that lamb had done based upon what the lamb had done and we are gonna take a body change based upon what the lamb has done the lamb of God the Bible says in Hebrews 11 by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain and and verse 5 by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him before before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God the Bible says in Isaiah chapter 53 all all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all what is this talking about it's talking about that lamb that will give us access back into the throne room he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he has brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her Shearer's it is dumb so he openeth not his mouth and the Bible says in Hebrews 9:22 almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission when second Corinthians chapter 5 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him in Romans chapter 5 verses 1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace do you see the lamb is the thing by which you have access access back into the grace of God the lamb is what gives you it is the key to opening up every promise of God but you see the thing is you've got to bring that lamb into your house you've got to do what they did down in Egypt land and eat that lamb and the Bible says they had heed everything even the pertinents thereof they had to eat the the hind part the head part and everything in between you've got to eat the whole revelation of Jesus Christ everything that's been revealed down through the triple seven church ages and now especially in this age we don't just get a part a we get the entire thing we have access to the whole thing that's been revealed to us and you see the revelation of that lamb is the key that will give you access to open up the door it will give you access you can catch that revelation you know what it'll make you do it'll make you come to church when the doors are open it'll make you open your Bible when you're home in a long time it'll make you begin to pray and ask God to reveal it to you it'll make you get serious with about God because you can see what the key is then you can have an understanding of what you have to do you see you know the whole journey the whole thing starts with your house in Joshua chapter 24 15 us as an if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father's served that we're on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorite sand whose land you dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord I believe that every Christian here today is going to make that same determination that same statement as for me and my house we are going to allow the lamb to come in we're gonna allow the lamb to come in and have complete lordship over my home not one room not one door in my house will be off-limits I'm gonna let him come in and have complete sway over the whole thing he can look and examine it pull open the dresser drawers and pull open the cupboards and look wherever he wants to and examine and see if there's anything unclean allow him to do like David said and search my heart and try my reins and search my whole house and see if there's anything within me that said that's not right because when the lamb is in your house that will give you access back to God and how do you get the key how do you get the lamb in your house eat the lamb you must eat the book you must take it and you must eat it all you must eat it up because we're going out in the morning they they couldn't go on that journey without eating that lamb they could not go on that journey without that blood over the door of our house they could not go over to the Red Sea and expected the part they could not go expect to go into the Promised Land except they had accepted that lamb into their house and you see that's one thing I believe that many times we wore with this we want to jump the gun we want to find a quick way to kind of to get to the end of the journey you can't you don't build a house without laying the foundation first because you imagine a couple getting married and they don't even realize whether or not they love each other and they don't have all they don't have oh the man doesn't have a job and the woman doesn't hardly have I understand the basics of her domestic ability and all those kind of things she doesn't hardly have her foundation laid out you don't you've got to lay a foundation before you before you move on you've got to get the you know people people come to church sometimes in there and they're beginning to say well I tell me what the seven seals are tell me we'll tell me what the seven seals you how are you going to get the seven seals unless you that foundation lady you can't out there you can't you can't even begin to approach to understand the seven seals of the seven thunders until you've had the foundation laid first worry about getting the lamb in your house and then you can worry about the things that come after that and the Bible says they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with the fire and unleavened bread and all those things I'm just trying to we got this new clock and there's moving around just the same as that old clock they're just in a different way we can see he is the key the lamb is the key the lamb is the key to open up the shut door the lamb is the key the lamb was the key to allow the high priest to go into the interval and everybody would be looking at the high priest going in the interval and wondering how can I go in there - and then one day the real lamb showed up and gave His life so that you two could go beyond the veil because the lamb is the thing that gives sight to your soul the lamb is God's pardon to you it gives you access to the promises of God it gives you power to overcome the devil the lamb is the seal on your life and what is the lamb what what do I mean when I say the lamb I mean the river the lamb is Jesus Christ so the revelation of Jesus Christ is the key that opens up access to you to every promise of God I hope you can see now how to know whether you got it or not do you see Jesus let me just read some quotes here before I gonna go on into we're gonna get that down into whether metal rubber meets the road here in a second and the message Washington Jesus's feet brother Brahim said well I won't he was talking about how he thought the mayor had left him a key to the city and all those kind of things but he said I don't know whether this is the key to the city but I tell you what I want what I want is the key to the scripture the Holy Spirit and the key to the door brother Graham said what the church needs tonight is the key to the Scriptures the door isn't that strange how could you even pick that in your mind that the key to the door is the door the key to the door is the door which Christ is the door and he is the word faith in the word of the Living God unlocks every door God give us this key give us the key and in the Philadelphia interchange brother Ram said how can it be how could any man know he is the Christ until he's revealed himself to him see he reveals himself he has the key he can open it or leave it alone see I have the key to the door I am the doors what Jesus is saying I am the way I am the truth I am the light I am the Alpha and the I am the Omega I am the first and the last I am the father I am the Sun I am the Holy Ghost I am NOT I was and so on and so forth he's saying I am the key I am the one that can open up the door and if you have him on the inside he will reveal himself to you and he will open up the door to you should I read all these quotes or not let me read this let me read this this quote that questions God hiding himself in simplicity in 1963 because this is a good one that you hear ministers quote all over the place everywhere that if you if you can surrender fully in other words if you can get that lamb inside of you if you can open up the door if you can if you can yield yourself so that the lamb can come in he'll come in fully when you surrender fully he'll come in fully but until you surrender he can't come in fully surrender surrender your thoughts surrender your thinking surrender your life surrender your all surrender your prestige surrender everything to him now and he'll come in and fill you with the Holy Ghost that's what he's here to do he's already struck two or three here in the building so you see we've covered what we've talked about tonight is that the problem is not the other people in the building the problem is your heart that you need your heart to be changed and the thing that will change your heart is this key and if you can get this key the lamb is the key if you can get the key if you can surrender yourself and allow the lamb to come in then he will give you access into all the promises of God you will be able to understand the promises of God and how things work do you realize your eyes the way a key works you can give a key to a little child and say go unlock my car and bring me the thing that's laying in the seat and come back a little child can use the key but as time goes on the mystery of that key unfolds and then one day they're driving the car but you see you as a little child and the gospel can use a key you have the access to the key and the key will give you access to the promises of God but you don't have full access until you have fully surrendered yourself until you have given yourself completely over to God and how do you fully surrender yourself by eating the lamb by eating it and eating it and eating it and God reveals himself to you until you understand what you're doing here the day and now that you're living here what your purpose is you see yourself in the word you're identified in the scripture you know who Jesus Christ is and God is leading you and guiding you until you're coming down to a whole niche revelation of who he is and you can see all the world falling off all the different ones falling away but yet God is keeping you because you have the key you have the key and so the question and ideas will you open up the door and let the lamb come in will you open up the lamb and allow him and I have access to your house will you open it up tonight and allow that key to have preeminence and your dwelling place and so tonight I want to get a little bit down into where the rubber meets the road why do you resist why do you resist allowing God to come in and have preeminence in your life when you hear the gospel preached when you see signs and wonders to perform when you go to camps and see miracles performing in your sight when you go to services and see things done and you're very missed before your natural eyes and still you don't really resist to allowing the Lamb to come into your house why do you resist and I'll say this to the born-again believers - there's a reason why do you resist why do you come to a place where you're really willing to go around and around Mount Horeb and you're not willing to allow God to come in and have complete preeminence over your life why do you resist the Holy Ghost why do you resist it let's see I believe one reason you see when Moses began to preach to those children of Israel down in Egypt he was preaching a message that you've got to let the lamb come into your house you've got to allow it to come in and you've got to eat it all and they began to maybe some of them would would say well I don't understand why we got to do this that seems unnecessary that seems very ugly that seems very go to grow tests and so you see they did they they did not recognize that God was at the door of their home they did not recognize that he was in their midst and so maybe maybe tonight you've got that same problem maybe tonight that you don't realize that God is actually walking the aisles down to the pews God is actually the one right now knocking on the door of your heart but but maybe that you've allowed the devil a bit harden your heart to a place where your heart has come to a place where you don't recognize that that is who that is knocking at the door of your heart you see you can only repent you can only come to a place of repentance when you recognize the greatness of God when you recognize who that is at the door the reason people don't repent anymore is because they don't fear God anymore that's the reason why people don't reverence their parents that are good god-fearing Christians that's the reason people don't reference them to reverence the ministry anymore it's because the fear of God has left them they don't recognize who that is at the door listen I'm gonna take it back to the scripture here the Bible in Matthew chapter 10 says he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me now let's let's dive into that let's think about that a little bit he that receiveth you he's sending his disciples out he's sending his preachers out he sent in the god-fearing parents out to raise their children and the admonition of the Lord and when you as a parent lay the word out before your children and it's the same word the same gospel that the Prophet spoke it's the same gospel that came straight out of from God out of heaven and and if your children will receive that they're receiving God tonight if you will receive the gospel that I'm preaching to you it's the same thing as receiving the Lambs it's the same as receiving God Jesus said in Matthew chapter 18 verse 3 to 6 and said verily I say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven become as little children who will just say teach me i my my bowl is empty fill it up give it to me and I'll do whatever you say if you'll do like that God can do something with you whosoever therefore therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me in other words if there's just a little child that all that know how to do in the gospel is take the key and open up the car door they can't even drive yet they're just a little child that can barely know how to operate the heavy machinery if you'll receive that little child that's got a revelation no matter how small it is of the gospel of Jesus Christ it's the same thing as receiving him but in Acts chapter 7 verse 51 and they say he's stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears that's a Stevens sermon the sermon that Stephen preached that got him killed you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your father's did so do you why do you resist they resist it and why do you resist tonight do you know you know there's many people in the Bible that resisted there's many people here tonight that resisted and then one day God got ahold of them do you know that Paul resisted the Holy Ghost polls out there persecuting Christians and when God finally got a hold of him and he saw the pillar of fire Jesus's words to him or why do you kick against the pricks he was pricking at him and prod at him and trying to get him to move and he was resisting the whole law and you might tonight be resisting the Holy Ghost but I say to you tonight I open up the door of your heart the lamb come in what we need to do is recognize that he is here do you do you remember that little story that brother Bram told about the little boy the little boy that that he got sentenced to four for doing a big crime and and and his mama went to the governor and cried and everything and said let my let my boy out they're gonna kill him and and finally the governor said all right I'm going to talk to him and the governor walked in that walked into the the jailhouse and and the little boy was so so prideful and just so full of it's so arrogant I only want to talk to nobody I don't care who that is I don't I don't even want to I don't even want to see you and and as the governor was leaving somebody said you are so I'll say it my words you're so dumb how could you be so stupid how could you be so ignorant to let the governor that had the pardon in his hand walk out and leave you and the little boy with the remorse went to the gallows and gave his life knowing that the governor had come to give him his pardon because he didn't recognize who that was at the door you see how to tonight do you recognize the lamb is here at the door knocking at the door of your heart my brother Bernie said the last thing the boy said when they put the blast black mask over his face to hang him when they pull the rope up tight put the mask over him said think of it the governor stood in my cell and would have pardoned me if I hadn't turned him out and you know one of these days there's gonna be a time come when many people will look back on congregants services like this like this very night and think if I would have known that Jesus Christ was in the building if I would have known that that was him knocking at the door in my heart I wouldn't have turned him out and I wouldn't I believe that's the purpose of the phone phone ministry is to identify to you when the governor when the G when the Lord Jesus is knocking at the door of your heart to open up your eyes like a light you did with a lot Elijah prayed for God to open up his service eyes so that he could see all the chariots of fire around the hill open up your tonight and see who that is knocking at the door of your heart tonight why do we resist another reason is because we're satisfied with where we are we get to a place where we just come to church and we're going through the motions and we're just coming and we're sitting where we're happy with that position in church we're happy with playing an instrument or whatever we're happy being a deacon we're happy being a minister whatever it is because you know you can get satisfied even if you're born again God being born again does not take away your free will you can get to a place where you're just like well I'm happy I'm a Christian I'm just fine with a place where I am and you get so complacent with where you don't go studying to study the word anymore you don't keep opening up here opening up your Bible at night you forget praying I was talking to somebody at a church in another Church recently and they were saying it seems like people in the message don't even believe in praying anymore they don't they don't pray anymore they and I want to tell you tonight I believe that you feel opened up the lamb and let that lamb have access to you something within you will begin to cry out for your fellow believers for your church for the home for your children something will begin to cry out and you you'll understand what true prayer is why because you're not satisfied with where you are oh don't Lord don't let me blow my voice out I got some more to say you're not satisfied with where you are we get to pledge to a place where we just find with where you are do you know do you know the Bible says that is the problem with the Laodicean Church age and later in Revelation chapter 3 he said it says I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hard I would that what colder heart so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth lukewarm means you're just going to church you're doing your helping you're putting some extra money into the church you're doing some things but yet you grow to a place where maybe maybe you think well III I don't know if can understand anymore it seems so complicated when they talk about seven seals and the seven thunders and Daniel seventy weeks and all these things you know what I'm just gonna I'm just going to put that off a little bit because I'm satisfied with where I am I'm satisfied do you realize that if you don't catch a revelation if God does not give you a revelation of the seven thunders if the seven thunders voices do not Thunder out in your life if God does not reveal that to you you will have to go by the way of the grave the seven Thunder Revelation is a revelation of the seven seals as a revelation that God is completing the work of redemption in you and you are going to take the body change but if you get complacent and say well I'm satisfied I don't need to understand all these things that seem so complicated I don't need to get into the mysteries why do I need to understand who is this milk is today why do I need to understand Christ the mystery of God revealed it's good enough for me to let me feel the Holy Ghost to be born again and I'm not gonna go on I'm not listen there's more to this than just being born again don't be satisfied when you come to faith something in you when you get born again should be crying out should be longing for more of God to never get satisfied never get satisfied while you're there there's always more of God and if you can fully or yield yourself God will fully fill you up never get bored tired weary or pessimistic listen we I think we get so satisfied with where we are that when we come to church many times we're already plotting our exit we're already thinking about how we can make a quick exit as soon as the doors come up what I'm gonna I'm gonna say I'm gonna get out of here as soon as the doors come up when I'm gonna I'm gonna try to get my car before the rush I'm gonna I'm out of here we're thinking we're plotting because our minds are not on the service we're not we're not concerned about the Word of God we're not concerned about the Word of God so much - we're ready to just say eat at all even the pertinence thereof we're so we're so concerned with how long the preacher goes and whether our behinds get tired or not and whether we get stiff in the chair sitting at listen to the preacher that I believe now more than ever we should be more concerned with the Word of God than ever because you can see the day and the hour that we're living in now is not the time to get complacent let me read some things that brother Graham said it serves we would see Jesus he said it's because there's something in them that desires to be satisfied they won't there's a little place in a man he's talking about why people go into seeing and all these things there's a little place in a man a man's heart a woman's heart and God made that place for himself how dare you try to take the things of the world and put it in there where God made for himself to sit there God is our joy God is our pleasure God is our satisfaction that's where it belongs in here let God in and let the other things and then the other things are so dead you don't even care about them no more and then down at the bottom he says let's climb at least keep climbing higher and higher until we reach that promised land you see there's there's another another quote I have in there I'll just I'll just touch on briefly about how brother Adam said that the reason that God likens his church his bride to an eagle it's because they Eagle does not set his nest down on the ground anywhere the eagle has high aspirations the eagle is always seeking to climb higher and higher in other words the Eagle is not satisfied by being down in the chicken yard the Eagle is got to go higher and you are an eagle and you've got to go higher you've got to always be climbing higher and higher and Deuteronomy this in Deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 10 to 15 I don't know why I'm rushing let me let me slow down we got we got time I'll get off I get all nervous or something and start rushing and and y'all don't make me nervous now don't don't start don't start again droopy-eyed that'll make me want to rush my brother aaron said i like that that was pretty good Deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 10 wind out this is the warning that God gave them in there and as they were coming into the Promised Land when thou has two eaten and Artful then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee see when you eat when you eat and your fool then you start getting satisfied that's a dangerous place to be that's why he says beware that they'll forget not the LORD thy God and not keeping his Commandments and his judgments and his statutes which I command thee this day lest when thou has two eaten and are full and I spilt goodly houses and dwelt therein and when I heard and that flocks multiply and that silver and that gold is multiplied and all that thou hast is multiplied then that heart be lifted up and now forget the LORD thy God which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from their house of bondage do you realize that's what meetings here sitting here tonight have done what we've done is we've we do you remember about when you first got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you were going to the meetings and yeah it didn't care how far away it was you would drive and you were so on fire for the Lord and you were eating and you got full and then it's time went on you found you a good church and you just kind of you began to just relax a little bit well we got it made here we got some good musicians we got some good preaching and you get complacent and you get to a place where you don't you stop digging into the world there's there's always no matter how deep you go into the gospel there's more and more things to continue to unfold remember what I was explaining about Abel to Enoch Abel started off on the little key of the lamb but it unfolded unfolded until it got to Enoch and Enoch took a body change Abel didn't take a body changed but Enoch took a body changed and the revelation of Jesus Christ unfolds and unfolds in your life until you become so fool that you'll take a body change but don't get complacent don't come to a place where you're satisfied and you just stop the Bible says in Psalms chapter 63 I love reading that when I when I was a brand new Christian I would read a and it inspired me how gung-ho and fervent and zealous he was for the Lord about how he talked about his heart paining for the Lord like his heart was painting like a heart a deer that would run after the water brook that in other words he he never got satisfied he always wanted more he said my soul shall be satisfied as with Mara and fatness and my mouth shall praise they were joyful lips when I remember the upon my bed and meditate upon thee on the night watches do you do that do you remember him when you go to bed are you do you sit there and just meditate on him and till the Spirit comes and washes over you and the tears begin to fall down your just praise of God it praise God in the midnight hour have you or have you come to a place where you're just you're just so complacent that you've forgotten those things I want to encourage like brother Wayne's been doing to get back to a person who a revival where it's you and God and the personal fellowship and something's happening in your life it might be it might not be happening in the person sitting next to you in the church pew but let it happen in your life because the problem is with your individual heart because thou has been my help he says that therefore in the shadow of our Wings will I rejoice my soul followeth hard after thee thy right hand up hold of me Psalms chapter 63 he said a psalm of David when he was in the wilderness of Judah Oh God thou art my god early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for the Mocs flesh longeth for thee and a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power in that glory so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary because thy loving-kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee do like David did and always be looking always be excuse me expecting expecting for something greater when you come to church I believe what we've what we've began to do is when we come to church we start expecting it to be the regular routine monotonous service but and the problem is not the service the problem is not the preacher the problem is not the song leader the problem is our expectations the problem was you the problem is that we've allowed ourselves to grow cold and weary but we were allowed ourselves to grow grow bored with what we're hearing but when you come into the sanctuary and you begin to expect God to speak to you to you then God will listen to you do you know Solomon we dedicated the temple he got the Ark of the Covenant in there he got everything all fixed but yet he was expecting something else to happen and then he began to call upon the name of the Lord he began to cry out to God and that's when the Shekinah glory came and filled the tabernacle and field that the lamb came and a bi abode there in the holy of holies and then one day Jesus the Lamb Himself came into the temple and the Pharisees and the Sadducees had gone to a place where they didn't expect anything anymore they were satisfied with a condition they were in they were fine and they because they were satisfied they didn't recognize when Jesus came to his temple and I'll read this before I keep going on it is not I be not afraid in 1960 brother I'm said you need him we all need him I need more of it you need more of it there's one thing that I can't get satisfied with there's one thing that I can't get satisfied with enough of God Oh as much as we can let ourselves go then God can come in but we've got to get ourselves out of the way our own ideas let the Holy Spirit come in and show us things to come he said he would do it and bring things to our remembrance cause you see we need a heart change tonight the problem is our heart the problem is our heart it's not my neighbor's heart it's our heart and you see there's a lot of different reasons why we resist because we don't recognize the presence of the Lord and here's another reason why we resist and I'm gonna be closing here in a minute I don't plan to keep you long tonight so don't don't worry about your weary back and those kind of things but listen the real reason this is where the rubber meets the road one of the reasons I believe tonight that we don't open up that door is because of our pride you know brother branham would say he was he would talk about how that that back then when he would be preaching he would talk about how that your flesh is hardly worth as if you could get all on the potash and all that stuff and put it in a little container whatever and measure it out weigh it out and see how much it was worth it would all come to 84 cents do you know what he was really talking about he's talking about your death when it comes down to the end of the road and your body is in the grave and your soul is going to go somewhere if your soul is not saved then all that's left is your body your body's down in the grave and all this living and looking in the mirror and taking selfies and and building up your hair and all this kind of stuff what will it amount to it won't amount to you it will amount to 84 cents you know I looked up what the what the price is with inflation recently and the price is still under $1 you're all of the components that go into your body is still worth less than $1 that's how much you are worth and we beauty it up we think what we do is we worry so much about what other people think that we're not willing to give ourselves over to Jesus Christ and you know what pride is I looked up the definition of it a pride is a feeling of deep play a feeling or deep pleasure or satisfaction derived from one's own achievements the achievements of those with whom one is closely associated or from qualities or possessions or possessions that are widely admired in other words when we begin to think that there's something about my makeup that makes me better than you and you know what happens in a young believers life for an old believer or any real believer really as you begin that pride begins to well up within you and you say I'm not gonna open up the door of my heart because I don't want to give somebody else credit for leading me to the Lord I don't want to give a gold my dad I don't want to get a gold star to that preacher I don't want to give us a gold star to this church your pride so Wells up within you and gee you think I'm the only one that can make a decision I'm the only one that can have an influence they can say and even when you to see other people begin to give their lives to the Lord you're so prideful that you begin to hate and despise listen that pride is a dangerous thing pride when you begin to it when your parents begin to talk to you about the Lord and begin to share the gospel with human pride begins to well up within you and say I'm not gonna open up the door but exact because if I give in it will give credit to my mom and daddy listen I believe tonight that there are some real god-fearing mamas and daddies in here and if anybody needs some credit it's a grill god-fearing mama and daddy that won't walk the walk that will walk that straight in there before you that will live a godly life it will pray before you pray pray over their house and try to try to live a clean sanctified life but what it what it's time to do is time to time to lay that pridefulness down and open up the door so that God can go meaning and second Timothy chapter 3 said this now know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents see how he loves all that in disobedience to parent I don't care what gospel my parents bring I don't care I'm the one that that I think should be I think that I should be the one to have a cellphone I think that I should be the one to rule the roost I think that I should be the one to have control and that pride begins to take over and you begin to think that you're somebody listen you're not somebody you're you're not worth more than a dollar more than a book if we could really get in our in our heads that we are nothing without Jesus without that lamp if that Keys if that lamb doesn't enter into our house we are nothing and one day we'll be nothing but dirt in the ground without natural affection Keith imagine all the trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good could you imagine coming into the house of the Lord and looking around and other people that are trying to live a godly life and say I don't want to be like that because of the pridefulness of your heart the hey the enmity of your heart that that is nothing but that is nothing but the devil that has veiled your eyes and pulled the wool over your eyes to cause you to think that you're greater than the God of heaven traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof i'm search trying to wait do you know what brother branham said the power of God is this is a thing that stumbles a lot of people the power of God is the word of God the power of God is when you allow the lamb to come into your home and you might feel something and you might not but God will reveal to you his word and that will give you power to overcome the devil and that's why I titled this sermon the key to overcome because they the key the lamb entering into your home will give you overcoming power to overcome everything that the devil throws your way proverbs chapter 16 says pride goeth before destruction and in hearty spirit before a fall better is it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly then to divide the spoil with the proud I'd rather I'd rather have a humble spirit with a lot of people that did a mountain of mush in other words is what he's saying then to have great riches and how to divide it up how to figure out a way to divide it up with a bunch of prideful people a bunch of people that think that they're better than everybody else and listen that believing the message doesn't make you better than the other Church down the road or anything like that but when you get a real true revelation of God it'll make you it'll bring you down until you realize that that God has elevated you from a from a place of of turmoil and despair and all those kind of things let's let's read James chapter 4 he adulterers and adulteresses you not know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world as the enemy of God do you think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy the spirit in us is always seeking a way to make ourselves happy the spirit in us that dwelleth in us lusteth am be the spirit of us is always trying to do something but God gives us grace wherefore he saith God resists the proud but giveth grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you know that's a scripture that we quote often resist the devil and he will flee from you but it says right before there that submit yourselves therefore to God submit yourself to God and then after you've allowed God to have control of your life to come in that you've opened up the door to him then you can resist the devil and he will flee from you draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands you sinners and purify your hearts you double-minded be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness you know you think about all of all the people in the Bible that were there were examples of a pride and the end that they came to and people that were examples of somebody that we're willing to lay aside their pride that like that little woman that came to Jesus feet and went by all the mockers and the scoffers and and she she everybody knew Simon was there toning her and saying I I know what she is if Jesus knew who she really was he wouldn't let her do that because I know that this woman is a sinner he said this man if he were a prophet would have known who who and what manner of woman this is that touches him for she is a sinner but you know what she abandoned her pride and laid her pride to the side that got her sins forgiven because jesus said your sins though their many are forgiven the woman at the well didn't care when she heard Jesus when he exposed all of her faults she didn't care whether or not her past was exposed but she ran into the city and told everybody come see a man that has told me everything that I've done she didn't care if the whole world knew what she had done and listen when God gives you a testimony you don't the whole world knows what you've done and yeah the Pharisee and the tax collector he said the Pharisee looking down I think they that I'm not like other men even as this publican and the tax collector they are abandoning his pride and beating his chest and he got his sins forgiven because he laid his pride to the side pride is a thing that will prevent you from opening up the door why do you not open the door because you're so prideful we get so prideful that we come into the house of God and we're we're afraid to raise up our hands because of what other people will think about us we're afraid to say Amen because of what do you realize how silly that is I'm not going to say Amen because somebody will think well think what well think that I'm getting something from the Lord what a silly notion that the devil has has put in our ears that we can't say Amen because somebody will think well think we're having a personal revival somebody will think that we're a real Christian somebody I can't raise my hand and rejoice maybe if we get rid of pride enough that something will really happen maybe if we stop caring so much about what people think then people will look at us and say I want to be like that person you know really the devil has got us all snooker so much that hey he's trying to eat he's give puddings pride on us so much that to prevent us from being an example of what a real Christian should be my if we had turn loose one time and if we turn loose like we do when we get in our cars or in the shower or when we're along walking down the trail on the hills when we're studying the Bible we're just saying praise God if we turn loose and just let let God have his way I believe I believe some doors would open up I believe the lamb would come in and I believe the lamb would come into the sanctuary if we had a band and I pride if we just get to a place where you don't care anymore remember that was being testified about he was he was wounding the holy ghost and I forget all the names of the different people but the brother was the brother who took him down to to the to the to the MU the the the Pigpen and and he said get down in there and wall around and and he said well I'm not I'm not quite there yet but one day he was ready to get in that get in there and wall around with the pigs to get the Holy Ghost in the band said well you don't have to do that you just have to be willing to what do you have to be willing to do you have to be willing to abandon your pride you have to be willing to do whatever it takes you have to be willing to open up that door listen pride is pride is what keeps us from opening the door pride is what what what says well you know what I'm just gonna I'm just gonna put putting the gospel up in a little bottle and set it over here and one of these days one of these days I'm gonna get to it but right now I'm not ready I'm too prideful to open up the door and let let God come in I'm just gonna I'm just gonna stick it up there maybe on the shelf and one of these days I'm gonna wine my way record back around to it do you do you realize what that is that is a dangerous place to be because that's like that little boy that told the governor that they told the governor I don't have time for you right now God is the one the bridegroom is the one that does the calling he's the one that does the calling and draw and and one day one day he might get tired of you he might get impatient with you and just turn away and and your leave you with a cold a drawn up hard heart that can't be touched by the gospel anymore do you realize one of the greatest gifts in the world that one of the greatest gifts is to hunger and thirst for righteousness for they that hunger and thirst for righteousness shall be filled so when you feel that little knock on your heart when you feel that little tug on the range of your heart then is the time dopant up don't put it up on the shelf and say one of these days I'm going to get to it one of these not now but one day I'm come back around to it and open up the heart one one day I'll get back to it do you realize what you're saying one day I'm gonna get back to God one day it's like it's like you get a phone call from God and God says I want to give you the Holy Ghost and you say I know I'm gonna put you on hold right now I'm gonna put the God of glory on hold and you hang up on the Lord you don't hang up on the Lord of glory you don't hang up on the governor now when you get that call from God then as the time to open up and add and how do you open it up how do you how do you receive the lamb is by eating the book this is the disis day do you know this is the age that brought God promised to come in and sup their age that that God probably in the Book of Revelations and this is the age where God the
