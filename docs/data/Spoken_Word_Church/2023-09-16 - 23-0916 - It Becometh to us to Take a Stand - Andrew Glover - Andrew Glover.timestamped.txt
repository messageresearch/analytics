[24:44] with the Believers and amen it's just a
[24:47] special time to be serving the lord it
[24:49] seems like everything is attacking
[24:50] Christianity and the things of God in
[24:52] this generation but to be in a numbered
[24:55] is one of them I believe that's the
[24:57] greatest honor of Our Lives amen and if
[24:59] you have your Bibles today will you go
[25:01] straight to the word we want to turn to
[25:03] the Book of Matthew the third chapter
[25:05] The Book of Matthew the third chapter
[25:07] and then also we're going to look in the
[25:09] book of Ephesians the sixth chapter and
[25:12] that we also want to say God bless you
[25:13] and we sure appreciate the invitation by
[25:15] the way he's inviting us to come back
[25:17] and be with you all again and I think
[25:19] last time he asked me if about coming I
[25:22] asked him if he was going to be here
[25:23] because it's just not the same being
[25:25] here and him not here picking on you I
[25:27] think last time we was here he was uh I
[25:30] think he was out maybe in Illinois
[25:31] killing them little old deer out there
[25:33] you know I I tell you man him things are
[25:35] small out there you know
[25:36] no we're just just joking with him amen
[25:39] but we sure appreciate by the way he
[25:41] appreciate his stand for this message
[25:43] and what the church here stands for and
[25:45] just to have a burden on your heart to
[25:47] do something for the young people we
[25:49] want to say thank you Amen to stand for
[25:51] this word and give him a place to
[25:52] Fellowship amen we sure appreciate the
[25:55] burden here on this assembly for this
[25:57] word and of course it's good to have my
[25:59] wife here in Mirai I think sister uh
[26:01] June back there has already grabbed a
[26:03] little baby so we're sure sure thankful
[26:05] to have them here with us this weekend
[26:07] and in the Book of Matthew the third
[26:09] chapter
[26:10] we want to look here in the 10th verse
[26:13] very familiar scripture here the Bible
[26:15] says and now also the ax is laid unto
[26:18] the root of the trees therefore every
[26:21] tree which bringeth forth not forth good
[26:24] fruit is shown down and cast into the
[26:27] fire I indeed baptize you with water
[26:29] unto repentance but he that cometh after
[26:32] me is mightier than I whose shoes I'm
[26:35] not worthy to Bear now he shall baptize
[26:38] you with the Holy Ghost and with fire
[26:41] whose fan is in his hand he will
[26:44] thoroughly purchase floor gather his
[26:46] wheat into the Garner but he will burn
[26:48] up the chaff
[26:50] with unquenchable fire now then cometh
[26:52] Jesus From Galilee to Jordan unto John
[26:54] to be baptized of him but John forbade
[26:57] him saying I have need to be baptized of
[27:00] thee and cometh thou to me and Jesus
[27:03] answering saith unto him suffer it to be
[27:06] so now so this is not in the future not
[27:09] in the past but suffer this to be so now
[27:12] for thus it becometh us to fulfill all
[27:16] righteousness then he suffered him amen
[27:20] now what I like about that is John is
[27:22] speaking to Jesus Jesus speaking back to
[27:25] John and he's showing them this is our
[27:27] purpose or this is our commission now in
[27:30] the book of Ephesians the sixth chapter
[27:32] I just want to read two verses from
[27:34] there and we'll pray and let you be
[27:37] seated this is another very familiar
[27:39] reading to to the Believers it's where
[27:41] Paul is addressing the Christian
[27:44] Soldiers and in Ephesians the sixth
[27:46] chapter and in the 13th verse he says
[27:50] now wherefore take unto you so you gotta
[27:53] you gotta possess it you gotta you gotta
[27:55] you gotta take it take unto you the
[27:58] whole armor of God that you may be able
[28:01] to
[28:03] they and having done all to stand now
[28:08] watch this stand so he does not give you
[28:11] another option if standing don't work
[28:13] here's something else to try he said but
[28:15] when you've done all to stand stand
[28:18] therefore having your loins Girt about
[28:20] with truth and having on the breastplate
[28:23] of righteousness amen let's just bow our
[28:25] hearts together how many would say Lord
[28:27] speak to me today Heavenly Father Lord
[28:30] as your Believers have gathered here
[28:31] this afternoon we're very well aware
[28:34] that we're not in this building by
[28:36] ourselves but Lord I believe there's an
[28:38] Angelic host in this building father to
[28:41] push back against the spirits of
[28:43] unbelief the spirits of doubt and Lord
[28:45] to bring of faith into the hearts of
[28:47] your children now Lord I pray that you
[28:49] would send the anointing in the building
[28:51] for Lord without the anointing the Yoke
[28:53] will remain but Lord because of the
[28:55] anointing the Yoke shall be destroyed
[28:57] father may you destroy the Yoke over the
[29:00] lives of these young people or whatever
[29:02] the enemy would be trying to tempt him
[29:04] in their minds and bind them in their
[29:06] Spirits oh God I pray that you would
[29:08] release him by your word today and
[29:10] Father may this be an Emmaus Road
[29:12] experience Lord and we'll be sure to
[29:15] give you all the praise all the honor
[29:16] and all the glory and the wonderful name
[29:18] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we
[29:21] pray and all the believer says
[29:24] hey man you may be be seated here today
[29:26] I want you by the help of the Lord for
[29:29] just a few moments to take those two
[29:31] passages of scripture and if I'd speak
[29:33] to you today I want to title this it
[29:35] becometh us to take a stand it becometh
[29:39] us to take a stand now brother Brandon
[29:42] preaches 1961 he preaches an entire
[29:45] sermon beautiful sermon and he calls it
[29:47] it becometh us to fulfill all
[29:50] righteousness now uh those of you that
[29:52] have the table you have the folio views
[29:54] on your computer if you'll look there
[29:56] you'll find that right underneath the
[29:58] title it becometh us to fulfill all
[30:01] righteousness you'll see that brother
[30:03] random actually originally titles that
[30:05] sermon stand for righteousness so it
[30:08] becometh us to fulfill our righteousness
[30:10] and in there I remember when I was first
[30:12] studying that tape over and over and
[30:13] over you're hearing him talk about stand
[30:15] Stan Stan and I begin to wonder why is
[30:18] he focusing so much on a stand but then
[30:20] I realized he's actually preaching stand
[30:23] for righteousness now in the book of
[30:25] Ephesians Paul says having done all to
[30:27] stand he says stand therefore amen
[30:30] having your loins gird about with truth
[30:32] now when you look at this word stand the
[30:34] word means to set it means to establish
[30:37] it means to stand still it is to be it
[30:40] to stand by it is to set up in the
[30:43] presence of others Amen in the midst
[30:45] before judges before members of the
[30:47] Sanhedrin it means to place to make firm
[30:50] to cause a person amen or a thing to
[30:53] keep his or its place so when something
[30:56] is standing it's in a position when
[30:59] something is standing it is not moving
[31:01] to the left or to the right but it is
[31:03] fixed amen it is to establish a thing it
[31:06] is to uphold or to sustain
[31:09] amen The Authority or the force of
[31:12] anything it is to stand and movable to
[31:14] stand firm of the foundation of a
[31:16] building so actually the foundation of
[31:19] this building is the stand of this
[31:21] building amen another definition means
[31:23] to continue safe and sound to stand
[31:26] unharmed he meant to stand ready or
[31:28] prepared to be of a steadfast mind of
[31:31] equality I love this one it is one who
[31:34] does not hesitate or does not waver amen
[31:37] so when one is standing they're not
[31:39] hesitating they're not wavering amen
[31:42] they're standing there amen without
[31:44] waver now my next question for you is
[31:46] how are we going to stand amen without
[31:48] wavering well brother Branham says the
[31:50] only way we can stand without wavering
[31:52] is we must have an unwavering Faith now
[31:56] in the message resurrection of Lazarus
[31:58] 51 he says now look deity I'm a part of
[32:01] Charles Branham because I was born from
[32:03] Charlie Branham my Daddy I'm a part of
[32:05] him I got a forehead like him my hair
[32:07] was like him I'm a small man like like
[32:09] him I'm in the nature like him because
[32:12] he's my dad and if we become in spirit
[32:15] sons of God Amen then deity dwells in
[32:19] the man see then you talk about blind
[32:21] eyes being open he said they said
[32:23] nothing is impossible to God Amen but
[32:26] God said nothing is impossible with you
[32:28] amen if you'll believe not with God but
[32:32] you amen deities in man amen amen deity
[32:36] is in man see the very God that stood
[32:39] back there on the mythical platform of
[32:41] the eternities and rolled the worlds off
[32:43] of his hands and created these things
[32:45] give you the privilege Amen to be his
[32:48] son and you are a part of him and God
[32:52] dwells in mankind and man himself is
[32:54] deity now that that's not that's not a
[32:56] skim milk man himself is deity amen
[33:00] there you are it might choke you amen
[33:03] but God dwells in man and man becomes
[33:06] the Son of God not him and himself amen
[33:09] about the Holy Spirit that's in him is
[33:12] God Amen the Creator lives in the
[33:15] creation he said then stand within an
[33:18] unwavering faith and ask what you will
[33:21] amen and it will be done unto you amen
[33:24] if you have got the holy ghost in your
[33:26] soul amen then you're not just a son of
[33:29] an Earthly father amen and an Earthly
[33:32] mother but there's an element of deity
[33:34] amen God himself is in you amen now come
[33:38] on church because you're a twofold being
[33:40] amen you're a human being but you're
[33:42] also let me sit this way you're you're a
[33:44] human being but you're also a god being
[33:47] amen I believe that the humanity is the
[33:50] wavering part amen I believe it's the
[33:52] humanity that wavers I believe it's the
[33:55] humanity that gets discouraged I believe
[33:57] it's the humanity that gets tired amen
[34:00] but there's another part of you amen and
[34:02] greater is he that is in you amen than
[34:05] he that is in the world now come on
[34:07] church amen it's the humanity see that
[34:10] is wavering it's the deity that's
[34:12] unwavering
[34:14] now the prophet of God said what made
[34:16] that big tumor disappearing my wife
[34:18] yesterday amen just a few days ago she
[34:20] was ready for the operating table and
[34:22] now they can't find a thing it's because
[34:24] the power of the resurrection of Jesus
[34:27] Christ that token of God that he still
[34:30] lives destroyed it what does these
[34:32] things what causes them to happen amen
[34:34] it's because you're he said no he said
[34:37] you're a product see amen so hold the
[34:40] token in your unwavering faith in his
[34:43] Word of Promise Amen to hold the token
[34:46] in his unwavering Faith In The Word of
[34:50] Promise now amen I know there's two ways
[34:52] we could say this amen we could say make
[34:54] a stand and take a stand now I know
[34:57] you're probably thinking there's no
[34:58] difference but actually I got to study
[35:00] on it and I found out that there is a
[35:02] difference in making a stand and taking
[35:04] a stand I didn't I did not title this
[35:06] it'd becometh us to make a stand I
[35:09] totally it became a faster take a stand
[35:11] because when you make a stand amen
[35:14] refers to a single event or a decision
[35:16] amen but when you take a stand it is
[35:19] more often applied to taking or adopting
[35:22] amen a stance or position to actions
[35:26] amen over a period of time so if you
[35:28] make a stand it's temporary amen but if
[35:31] you if you take a stand amen it's
[35:34] something that's going to last more than
[35:36] just a service it's going to last more
[35:38] than just the Youth Camp it's going to
[35:40] last more than just a special meeting
[35:41] amen when you take a stand you are
[35:45] avowing to God that what I'm standing
[35:47] for is something I'll still be standing
[35:49] for a year from now amen or two years
[35:52] from now amen because see our stand is
[35:55] our position amen our stand is our
[35:58] position that's why the prophet of God
[36:00] said amen God may we tonight take our
[36:02] stand amen our position in Christ he
[36:05] said they're like men and women of God
[36:07] Sons and Daughters are the Creator who
[36:09] just spoke the world came into existence
[36:11] he said God we call ourselves Christians
[36:14] and can't even believe for little
[36:16] healings amen what you promised to give
[36:18] us God forgive us amen of our stupidity
[36:21] and may we rise tonight like real men
[36:24] and women Sons and Daughters of God and
[36:26] go forth in the earth conducting
[36:28] ourselves in like manner amen then as
[36:31] Sons and Daughters of God Amen it is our
[36:34] duty Amen to stand for Jesus Christ I
[36:37] love what the prophet said he said it's
[36:39] our duty to take our stand it's God's
[36:41] duty to back us up
[36:43] amen it's our duty to take the stand
[36:46] amen but it's God's duty to back us up
[36:49] amen that's why now I'm just going to
[36:51] preach for a second he said because if
[36:53] you do your part amen then you'll find
[36:55] out that God will do his amen if you do
[36:58] your part your part is taking the stand
[37:01] amen but God's part is to supply Supply
[37:04] the strength Amen to continue in the
[37:06] stand that you've taken now another
[37:08] place you said then when we take our
[37:10] stand today when men say these things
[37:12] can happen don't be fussing with him
[37:14] amen that's wrong don't fuss with them
[37:16] but pick up the sword see now watch
[37:19] here's your part amen pick up the sword
[37:22] amen look at what's supposed to be in
[37:24] this day when God give his promise for
[37:27] today he said now pick this up this
[37:29] Bible The Sword and go and all the
[37:32] goliaths will fall under it amen when
[37:35] you pick up when you do your part and
[37:37] you pick up the sword amen and go
[37:39] forward amen all the goliaths will fall
[37:42] underneath the sword come on church it
[37:45] was not David's job to put Goliath under
[37:47] the sword it was David's job to pick up
[37:50] the sword to take God at his word and to
[37:53] withstand amen that uncircumcised
[37:55] Philistine but it was God's part Amen to
[37:58] lay the life underneath the sword of
[38:00] David listen church it's not your part
[38:02] Amen to put the devil underneath her
[38:05] foot it's not your part to defeat the
[38:07] Devil amen God already defeated that
[38:10] devil 2 000 years ago amen your part is
[38:13] to pick up the faith in the word of God
[38:15] Amen and March over those Devils with a
[38:18] full unwavering faith in the Vindicated
[38:21] word of God now come on amen amen
[38:23] sometimes you've got to realize it all
[38:25] and all up to the preacher
[38:27] it ain't all up to the pastor it ain't
[38:30] all up to the youth leader amen
[38:32] sometimes you got to realize you got a
[38:34] part to play amen it was David's part to
[38:37] pick up the sword it was David's part to
[38:40] take a stand it was David's part to
[38:42] confess that God was bigger than that
[38:44] uncircumcised Philistine amen but it was
[38:47] God's part to lay glass under David's
[38:49] sword amen David was too small to do
[38:52] that David had no physical ability he
[38:55] meant to take a giant and make a and
[38:57] make a a a a a a a defeated enemy out of
[39:00] him but God had the power because David
[39:03] had the courage to take a stand you know
[39:06] I find many times that people make
[39:08] stands at camps and they make stands and
[39:10] meetings and conventions and the reason
[39:12] they make those stands is because the
[39:14] atmosphere amen is so charged and amen
[39:18] it's so easy to say that's right I'll
[39:19] I'll stand for Jesus you know amen
[39:22] getting a good hot meeting on a Saturday
[39:23] night in the power of God moving amen
[39:25] and it's easy to Rejoice it's if you got
[39:28] a sickness in your body amen go through
[39:30] a good prayer line and the anointing is
[39:32] there and the power of God is there and
[39:35] you say I'm Healed and you walk out the
[39:37] door amen now what you did was you made
[39:39] a stand amen but when you get home and
[39:41] you wake up the next morning and that
[39:43] old lying symptom is still there amen
[39:46] you've got to take a stand now amen you
[39:48] made a stand last night amen but now you
[39:51] got to take a stand remember said you've
[39:53] got to make a stand and then continue to
[39:56] stand amen you got to take a stand by
[39:59] continuing to stand I don't believe that
[40:01] God is looking for people Amen to make
[40:03] us stand temporarily but I believe he's
[40:06] looking for someone who will take an
[40:08] eternal stand now the prophet of God
[40:10] said faith cannot rest upon the shifting
[40:13] Sands of man's theology
[40:15] but Faith takes its Eternal stand upon
[40:19] the unchangeable and unshakable Rock of
[40:22] Ages and can stand there while the waves
[40:25] amen is beating the bottom out of it
[40:28] amen and the grave is open and look
[40:30] across the sea to him that said I am the
[40:33] resurrection and the LIE see amen stand
[40:36] there now I'll sit like this if you
[40:38] don't stand for something
[40:40] you're going to fall for anything if you
[40:44] don't stand for something you're going
[40:46] to fall for anything do you realize that
[40:48] there's actually only two positions
[40:50] today amen that people will find
[40:52] themselves in they're either standing or
[40:55] they're bowing
[40:56] they're either standing or they're
[40:58] bowing you say now now preacher what are
[41:00] you getting at well as Believers I
[41:02] believe that we are to stand I I just
[41:05] don't believe we're to Bow till they
[41:06] ought to see you I don't believe we're
[41:08] to bow to spirits of this world I'll be
[41:10] honest with you I don't believe that a
[41:12] church ought to bow to the spirit of
[41:13] lukewarmness I I just don't think we
[41:15] ought to bow to these things I believe
[41:17] amen that the time has come that Satan
[41:19] don't want us to stand amen but God is
[41:22] calling for us to stand but remember
[41:24] said it's so strange to see that when
[41:26] people take a stand for God looks like
[41:28] the devil throws everything in their way
[41:30] that he can Amen to throw in their way
[41:33] but do you realize we're one of the
[41:35] greatest experiences in your life comes
[41:37] from it comes from standing brother Emma
[41:40] said the greatest experience I've ever
[41:42] had is to come up against something I
[41:44] could not get over or under it but I
[41:47] just stand there amen and I watch God
[41:49] make a way through it see that's the way
[41:51] to do it just move just keep moving amen
[41:54] press your nose against it and amen just
[41:57] keep moving on God Will Make A Way amen
[42:00] then your stand is connected to your
[42:02] Victory amen your stand is connected to
[42:05] seeing amen the situation changed amen
[42:08] and God come on the scene and get the
[42:10] glory I believe that time is at hand
[42:12] Amen to make a stand and take a stand
[42:15] what about it young people I think it's
[42:17] time to make a stand but I think it's
[42:19] time to take a stand but remember said
[42:21] if you're going to make a stand for God
[42:23] make it now amen this is the time now's
[42:26] the time that we need it he said another
[42:28] place I want to go on record in heaven
[42:30] tonight that in this Auditorium here in
[42:33] this great City of Chicago in the High
[42:35] School auditorium I want to go on record
[42:37] amen that I stand for Jesus Christ
[42:41] I want to go on record today that I
[42:44] stand for Jesus Christ and for his
[42:47] righteousness another place if you'd
[42:49] lived in some days gone by when they
[42:51] crucified Jesus you'd say oh I would
[42:53] have stood for him I'd give my life for
[42:55] him amen but you have more of an
[42:57] opportunity to do that now than you
[43:00] would in them days see he said stand now
[43:03] amen the opposition is greater today
[43:05] than it was then amen well if I'd have
[43:08] been there man in the days of the
[43:10] crucifixion I would have stood for him
[43:12] amen but right here in this age they're
[43:14] crucifying amen the word of God young
[43:17] people and you've got as much a chance
[43:19] right now to take a stand amen as they
[43:22] did on the day of Calvary amen because
[43:24] the word is being crucified again but I
[43:27] believe that God is raising up a
[43:29] generation of young people who will not
[43:31] back up they will not turn around they
[43:34] will not lay down amen but they will put
[43:36] their nose to the devil and they will
[43:38] push back against that devil until
[43:40] Liberty
[43:42] come on church I think that's what we
[43:44] need in the house of God Amen it's not
[43:46] so much arrogant infested and who can do
[43:48] what who can say what I think we need
[43:50] the liberty of the Holy Ghost Amen to
[43:53] come back in the church in the fire and
[43:55] the Dynamics of the spirit of God until
[43:57] there comes a strength in the church
[44:00] now amen I don't believe that God Amen
[44:03] has called us to be weaklings I don't
[44:05] believe God has called us to be cowards
[44:07] amen but I believe it takes courage to
[44:09] make a stand I love what the Bible says
[44:11] in second Peter 1 it says the prophecy
[44:14] came not an old time amen by the will of
[44:16] men but holy men of God spake as they
[44:20] were moved by the Holy Ghost you know
[44:22] what kind of men we're talking about
[44:23] we're not talking about church members
[44:25] we're not talking about religious uh
[44:28] social gatherers we're talking about God
[44:30] called individuals the prophet of God
[44:33] said and God don't want cowards
[44:36] oh brother God don't want cowards he
[44:40] cannot use you if you're afraid to take
[44:42] his word and believe him he wants
[44:45] Gallant men amen that won't pay
[44:47] attention to nothing amen but what the
[44:50] Lord says that's the kind he has to move
[44:53] with now listen Church regardless of
[44:55] what the church says what the pastor
[44:57] says what the church stands for he
[45:00] stands for God and righteousness and his
[45:04] word amen a god-called man is not a
[45:07] coward amen A God Called man is a
[45:09] gallant man he's a man that stands for
[45:12] God his word and righteousness now as
[45:15] message Believers I know sometimes as
[45:18] young people we spend a lot of time Amen
[45:21] instilling in our young people what we
[45:23] stand against
[45:24] we we let's just be honest we do we
[45:27] stand against this and we stand and we
[45:29] do we do we we actually do stand against
[45:32] things but I just want to say this as
[45:34] message Believers we don't just trying
[45:36] to get something but we actually stand
[45:39] for something
[45:40] we're not just here standing against
[45:42] something we actually stand for
[45:45] something everybody said in the church
[45:46] age book he said now remember this that
[45:48] Christ in the true church is a
[45:51] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[45:53] Book of Revelation shows how the
[45:55] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[45:57] church and would defile it make it
[45:59] lukewarm amenformal and Powerless it
[46:02] exposes Satan it Reveals His works the
[46:05] attempted destruction of God's people
[46:07] and the discrediting of God's word amen
[46:10] right down to the time he is cast in the
[46:12] Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot
[46:15] stand it because he knows listen the
[46:18] devil knows that if the people get the
[46:20] true revelation of the true church and
[46:23] what she is now listen and what she
[46:26] stands for amen not just what she stands
[46:29] against amen but what she stands for
[46:32] that she can do the Greater Works she
[46:35] won't be an invincible Army if they get
[46:37] a true revelation of the two Spirits we
[46:40] in the framework of the Christian church
[46:42] and by God's spirit discern and
[46:45] withstand the Antichrist spirit amen
[46:47] then Satan will be powerless before her
[46:49] come on church amen the devil is not
[46:52] powerless before us amen because of what
[46:55] we stand against I'm going to preach to
[46:57] you amen because we're not the only
[46:59] people that stand against women cutting
[47:01] their hair we're not the only people
[47:03] that stand against boys not wearing
[47:05] shorts well we used to amen we're not
[47:07] the only people that stands against
[47:09] having televisions and if we used to we
[47:11] ought to do it now because it's still
[47:13] the word of God now now it's Saturday
[47:15] morning or Saturday afternoon I might as
[47:16] well preach I'm here amen what we've
[47:18] stood against then we still stand
[47:20] against today but that's not where the
[47:22] strength is coming from Amen to defeat
[47:25] the Devil and to do the Greater Works
[47:27] amen the strength is coming from what we
[47:30] stand for see he will be as definitely
[47:32] forwarded today as when Christ withstood
[47:36] his every effort to gain power over him
[47:38] and the dancer oh yes Satan hates
[47:41] Revelation amen but we love it amen we
[47:45] love Revelation with the true Revelation
[47:47] in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot
[47:51] Prevail against us but we will prevail
[47:54] against them see what she stands for
[47:57] amen not against is what produces an
[48:01] invincible Army now somebody said well
[48:03] brother Ram said there we've got to
[48:04] discern that's right amen but let me
[48:06] break this down for you Discerning is
[48:08] one thing and with standing is another
[48:13] Discerning is one thing but withstanding
[48:16] what has been discerned is another you
[48:18] know the prophet preaches an entire
[48:20] sermon called the discernment of spirit
[48:21] right he says and every Christian is
[48:24] under commission Amen to discern or to
[48:27] try the spirit amen and to prove whether
[48:29] it's of God or not right amen now listen
[48:32] it's easy to discern something and say
[48:34] well that's right or that's wrong amen
[48:37] but where the battle comes is when
[48:39] you've got to withstand what you discern
[48:41] to be wrong I can prove it to you from
[48:43] the Bible in the book of Samuel the
[48:45] Bible says that David spake to the man
[48:47] stood by him and said what shall be done
[48:50] to the man that killeth this Philistine
[48:52] and taketh away the approach from Israel
[48:55] amen now watch for who is this
[48:57] uncircumcised philistine
[48:59] that he should defy the armies of the
[49:03] Living God now watch a prophet amen pick
[49:05] this up in scripture he shows you what
[49:07] the Bible says how that David threw both
[49:10] The Lion and the bear and he said now
[49:12] this uncircumcised Philistine amen shall
[49:15] be as one of them when David identified
[49:18] this that Goliath was an uncircumcised
[49:21] Philistine who had put a reproach upon
[49:24] the armies of the Living God and
[49:26] something ought to be done about this
[49:27] therefore amen David discerned Goliath
[49:30] amen but that was not David with
[49:32] standing Goliath the Bible says that he
[49:34] went and took his staff in his hand and
[49:37] he chose him five smooth stones out of
[49:39] the brook and put them in a shepherd's
[49:41] bag which he had even in a script and
[49:44] his sling was in his hand and he drew
[49:46] near to the Philistine so David didn't
[49:48] just stand out there and say brother
[49:50] Zach something's got to be done
[49:52] something's got to be done but when
[49:54] David went over there and picked up five
[49:56] smooth stones and he got his slingshot
[49:59] and he walked out there and met that
[50:01] Goliath he was no longer just Discerning
[50:04] Goliath amen but now he was withstanding
[50:06] Goliath and I believe there's an army
[50:09] here today that's not just Discerning
[50:11] things and laodicea is wrong amen but
[50:14] there is a strength and there is a
[50:16] courage that has come into the heart of
[50:18] this generation Amen to withstand those
[50:20] Devils they said we don't just withstand
[50:22] the devil at church we withstand him on
[50:25] Monday morning we were standing on
[50:27] Tuesday week amen because we're not here
[50:29] just to say well this is wrong and
[50:30] that's wrong we're here to withstand
[50:32] these things
[50:34] but you got to take a stand now but
[50:36] membership by faith David saw the
[50:38] victory he said he saw the victory he
[50:41] said look out Goliath you've got to fall
[50:43] and when he set that loose the Holy
[50:45] Ghost amen got a hold of that little
[50:47] Stone and picked up a speed about a
[50:49] thousand miles per second and struck
[50:52] that giant between the face and he fell
[50:54] forward Hallelujah Oh my he said like a
[50:57] little Jim Crow danced up there jumped
[50:59] on him pulled his sword out chopped his
[51:01] head off said how do you like fat boy
[51:02] reached down got him by the hair of his
[51:04] head said come on boys amen let's preach
[51:07] Divine Healing and away they went he
[51:09] said you know what they done the rest of
[51:11] them seen it could be done and they cut
[51:13] Philistines Plum to the wall the come on
[51:17] Amen Goliath had every one of them as a
[51:19] bunch of cowards they've been scared to
[51:21] death to do anything amen but when God
[51:23] got a hold of a David and he discerned
[51:25] that devil and he withstood that devil
[51:28] and he cut Goliath's head off amen that
[51:30] brought a liberty into the entire Camp
[51:32] he meant to believe that God God if he
[51:35] could do it for David he could do it for
[51:37] me let me say church amen we don't need
[51:40] a thousand people here today we just
[51:42] need one believer Amen to get in contact
[51:44] with a god of Abraham and believe that
[51:47] if he did it for you he can do it for
[51:50] somebody else and in a few minutes
[51:51] devils are going to find spirits will be
[51:54] defeated listen because God just needs
[51:57] somebody to get some courage to get some
[52:00] grit to take a stand listen David I love
[52:03] how David says this in psalm 16 verse 5.
[52:06] he says the Lord is the portion of my
[52:09] inheritance and of my cup thou amen
[52:12] maintain this my lot you know what David
[52:14] here is saying brother Wade I believe
[52:16] that David is saying the Lord is my
[52:19] portion
[52:20] you agree the Lord is my portion now
[52:24] when you start looking at this word
[52:25] portion amen portion means territory so
[52:28] what David is actually saying is the
[52:31] Lord is my territory in other words he
[52:34] is all that I have and all I have is
[52:37] because of him in other words there will
[52:40] be no fight until the devil gets on my
[52:43] territory they'll be we know there'll be
[52:45] no Bloodshed there'll be no swords drawn
[52:48] until the devil gets over on my
[52:50] inheritance then there's going to be a
[52:52] battle because the Bible says in Psalm
[52:54] 73 26 My Flesh and my heart failth amen
[52:59] but God is the strength of my heart and
[53:02] my portion forever Psalms 119 57 Thou
[53:05] Art my portion O Lord I have said that I
[53:08] will keep my words Psalms 142 verse 5 I
[53:12] Cried unto thee O Lord I said Thou Art
[53:15] my refuge and my portion in the land of
[53:19] the living Lamentations 3 24 the Lord is
[53:22] my portion saith my soul therefore will
[53:26] I hope in him so David here is speaking
[53:29] of an inheritance he is speaking of
[53:31] apportion he is speaking of a Heritage
[53:33] now do you realize that we as spiritual
[53:36] Sons and Daughters of God we have a
[53:38] spiritual Heritage and our spiritual
[53:41] Heritage is none other amen then the
[53:44] word of God the Bible says in Acts 20
[53:47] verse 32 now Brethren I commend you to
[53:49] God and to the word of his grace which
[53:52] is able to build you up amen and to give
[53:55] you an inheritance among all them which
[53:58] are Sanctified amen now the word of
[54:00] Grace can justify you then it can bring
[54:03] you over into the Second Step a stage of
[54:06] restoration and can give you an
[54:08] inheritance among those which are
[54:10] Sanctified that's what the prophet of
[54:12] God said he said if God can ever get a
[54:14] people under his own control
[54:16] if you'll get a man or a woman that
[54:19] won't compromise on his word but will
[54:21] stand there like the Rock of Ages amen
[54:24] when you have been given a portion of
[54:26] inheritance among those which are
[54:28] Sanctified you have been given a place
[54:30] in the Rock of Ages and you will stand
[54:33] like the Rock of Ages stood they'll
[54:36] believe every word of it that'll believe
[54:38] that he's behind it and a man who
[54:40] believes it you must act like it and if
[54:42] you don't act like it then you don't
[54:44] believe it but if you believe it then
[54:45] act like it and you know that's powerful
[54:47] can I read that again amen if you
[54:50] believe it then act like it if you don't
[54:52] act like it then you don't believe it
[54:53] but if you believe it then act like it
[54:55] and you can put it to work and the word
[54:58] will be in you see then how is our
[55:01] heritage lost amen our heritage is lost
[55:04] by compromising when we give up our
[55:06] stand when we give up our position the
[55:09] polygon said we lost our heritage
[55:11] because we just compromised and when we
[55:14] compromise now listen church when we
[55:16] compromise eyes then we cannot expect
[55:19] God to keep his promise to us
[55:22] when we compromise we cannot expect God
[55:26] to keep his promise to us are you ready
[55:28] for this because we broke in up on this
[55:31] sacred Trust
[55:32] yeah and they found the trust that God
[55:36] gave us he said then let us keep that
[55:38] trust keep it sacred keep it holy keep
[55:42] every word of it and compromise nowhere
[55:45] then do you realize as young people that
[55:47] you did not stumble into this age
[55:50] you did not accidentally stumble into
[55:52] this age amen we have been sent into
[55:54] this age do you know why we've been
[55:56] sinning this age to prove God's word
[55:59] Paul said in Romans 12 he said I beseech
[56:02] you verse one therefore my brethren by
[56:04] the mercies of God that ye present your
[56:06] bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and
[56:09] acceptable amen now watch this unto God
[56:12] which is your reasonable service and
[56:15] being not conformed to this world but be
[56:18] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[56:21] that you may prove that you may prove
[56:23] that ye may prove what is that good amen
[56:27] and acceptable and perfect will of God
[56:29] Revenge preaches an entire sermon and he
[56:31] calls it proving his word paragraph 210
[56:34] he said he proves all of his words just
[56:37] think of it all of his words and you
[56:39] were his word he was the word and you
[56:42] were a part of this word and that's the
[56:44] reason you're sent here is to confirm
[56:47] your place in life so you didn't stumble
[56:50] people into laodicea you didn't stumble
[56:52] into this message but you were sent here
[56:54] amen by the predestination of almighty
[56:57] God Amen to confirm your place in life
[57:00] now watch a prophet turn a corner and
[57:03] say there will be a resurrection of the
[57:05] Dead there will be a Rapture of the
[57:07] church there will be a millennium there
[57:09] will be a new heavens and a new Earth
[57:11] amen and he'll prove it because his word
[57:13] said so and only the righteous will be
[57:16] there only the righteous only the ones
[57:19] who took a stand amen and they did not
[57:22] back off of the Sacred trust they did
[57:24] not defile The Inheritance they did not
[57:26] compromise one place but they stood and
[57:29] they put their nose against the devil
[57:30] and every day every week every month
[57:33] every year they fought back against the
[57:35] devil amen because they're here to
[57:37] confirm their place as a Victorious son
[57:40] and daughter of God Only The Righteous
[57:43] will be there
[57:45] oh that now can I preach to you only the
[57:48] ones that's been made part of this word
[57:50] see will be their part and their
[57:53] position in this word for this day for
[57:56] their age will be the only ones who'll
[57:58] be there because that's just what it is
[57:59] he is the word and what is a woman she
[58:02] is the image of a man what is the church
[58:05] the image of the word only the True
[58:07] Believers in his word amen know this and
[58:11] can believe it amen only the True
[58:13] Believers in his word know this and
[58:16] can't believe it then what is this
[58:18] message the message of the hour amen is
[58:21] a spiritual union to Christ by the word
[58:24] amen you are the bride of Christ right
[58:26] then listen what a prophet said he said
[58:29] the bride will know her husband will
[58:31] know her mate the revealed word then you
[58:34] are married to the revealed word there
[58:37] is a sacred trust in the revealed word
[58:40] you have got a position to confirm in
[58:43] that revealed word and this right amen
[58:45] this bride then she's not going to come
[58:47] into this Sanctified among the
[58:49] Sanctified but the way she's going to
[58:51] come in is she's going to be Washed by
[58:54] the Water of the word Paul said amen
[58:57] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[58:59] with the washing of the Water by the
[59:01] word I love what the prophet said he
[59:04] said cleanse us Lord how many say Lord
[59:05] today just cleanse us man just cleanse
[59:09] the sword amen from all unbelief that we
[59:12] might be drawn nigh unto thee as a
[59:14] Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable
[59:17] unto God Amen for this is our reasonable
[59:20] service what did Paul say he said that
[59:23] we might be washed By the Waters of the
[59:25] word do you know what a washing means a
[59:28] washing means a bath or a bathing amen
[59:30] do you know what a bath does Amen a bath
[59:33] actually separates you amen from the
[59:35] dirt now now some of you Brothers you
[59:37] come home you've been outside working
[59:39] all day dirt under your fingernails dirt
[59:41] behind your ear smell like a pole can
[59:43] amen and there's a there's a beautiful
[59:45] table spread with all kinds of good food
[59:47] you know amen you don't walk in amen
[59:50] kick your boots off go sit down at the
[59:52] table all that filth on you and partake
[59:54] of the meal but your wife says honey go
[59:56] take a shower amen and what do you do
[59:58] you get in the shower now when you get
[1:00:00] in that bath you're going to get
[1:00:02] underneath the water then there's going
[1:00:04] to be some soap now come on Amen
[1:00:07] hopefully you believe in pain
[1:00:08] gonna be some soap amen and what's going
[1:00:11] to happen is the dirt is going to be
[1:00:13] attached to you but when you get out of
[1:00:16] the shower you're going to get out but
[1:00:18] the dirt's going to stay you know what
[1:00:19] that tells me brother Mike Matt tells me
[1:00:22] that the dirt is not more powerful than
[1:00:24] the water the dirt is not more powerful
[1:00:27] than the soap there is something in the
[1:00:29] water and the soap that can a serp an
[1:00:32] authority over that dirt and cause it to
[1:00:35] take its hands off of you and let you
[1:00:37] come out clean don't you see why you
[1:00:39] need to come to church it's cause dirt
[1:00:41] gets in our lives it gets into our homes
[1:00:43] and when that word begins to lay out
[1:00:45] over the church the washing of the Water
[1:00:47] by the word amen begins to push back the
[1:00:50] dirt and you come out clean
[1:00:53] you come out clean and the dirt stays
[1:00:56] behind amen because our bath is the
[1:00:59] Waters of Separation brother Bob it's
[1:01:01] not the Waters of mixing it's the Waters
[1:01:04] of separation and the Waters of
[1:01:06] separation is by the word now we read
[1:01:09] Matthew three I love Matthew 3 because
[1:01:11] in there Jesus is speaking with John and
[1:01:14] John is asking Jesus why would someone
[1:01:17] like me have to baptize someone like you
[1:01:19] basically yeah and the prophet picks us
[1:01:22] up and says now why would a man like
[1:01:25] Jesus have to be baptized he said why
[1:01:27] would a person have to be baptized like
[1:01:29] a man coming baptism is after confession
[1:01:31] he had no confession to make because he
[1:01:34] was God see but what it is is he was our
[1:01:37] example right our example is Christ so
[1:01:41] then there must be a basis that we can
[1:01:43] put our faith on remember him said like
[1:01:45] this he said the truth of it was he was
[1:01:47] the anatype he was the high priest and
[1:01:50] before the high priest could be anointed
[1:01:52] he had to be washed amen so before an
[1:01:56] anointing there must be a washing I'm
[1:01:59] just going to preach to you what I
[1:02:00] believe for a second I believe we've
[1:02:01] tried to have too many anointings
[1:02:03] without without it without Washings
[1:02:05] they're gonna come on Amen we're
[1:02:07] screaming for the anointing but we don't
[1:02:09] want no washing amen but the anointing
[1:02:12] follows the washing it's an Ezekiel or
[1:02:14] Exodus rather sorry Exodus 29 when the
[1:02:17] Bible said shall wash them with water
[1:02:19] then shout thou take the anointing oil
[1:02:21] and pour it up on his head and anoint
[1:02:23] him see Aaron the high priest before he
[1:02:26] could ever be anointed he had to be
[1:02:29] washed with the water see the Bible said
[1:02:31] that Jesus was anointed where the Holy
[1:02:34] Ghost and went about doing good things
[1:02:35] so before Jesus was anointed with the
[1:02:38] Holy Ghost he was at the river of Jordan
[1:02:41] the water and he received the baptism
[1:02:43] amen as an example to every belief her
[1:02:46] who will believe on the name of the son
[1:02:49] of God and will be baptized in that name
[1:02:51] will come through a washing that there
[1:02:53] will come an anointing upon the life of
[1:02:56] that believer because why we are Kings
[1:02:59] and Priests unto God
[1:03:02] now the Bible says Revelation 1 5 he
[1:03:04] said we have been washed which means
[1:03:06] loose from our sins in his own blood see
[1:03:09] then the blood was greater than the sin
[1:03:11] when you went through the blood you come
[1:03:14] out but the sin stayed in the Sin could
[1:03:17] not pass to the blood because there was
[1:03:20] something greater in the blood than
[1:03:22] there was in the Sin oh if you've got
[1:03:25] Hallelujah if you can raise your hands
[1:03:28] and say God I've been sealed I've been
[1:03:30] saved I've been cleansed by the blood
[1:03:32] you ought to be the happiest person in
[1:03:34] this church today that there's a blood
[1:03:37] there's a propitiation there's an
[1:03:39] atonement and there's something in that
[1:03:41] blood that's greater than what was in
[1:03:43] your sin
[1:03:45] come on Church the blood is strong the
[1:03:49] blood is powerful program said what
[1:03:51] washed he said actually the word wash
[1:03:52] means loose he said now it was in his
[1:03:55] own blood that he loosed us completely
[1:03:57] from our sins it was not human blood can
[1:04:02] we agree it was not human blood he said
[1:04:04] now watch it was the blood of God Peter
[1:04:06] called it the blood of Christ Paul
[1:04:08] called it the blood of the Lord and the
[1:04:09] blood of Jesus it was not three persons
[1:04:12] but it was one person there's that
[1:04:14] Revelation again one God that omnipotent
[1:04:17] Jehovah God came down and made himself
[1:04:20] in a body by means of the Virgin birth
[1:04:22] and indwelt it that he might be the
[1:04:24] blood of God that would free us or loose
[1:04:27] us entirely
[1:04:30] the blood of God would loose us entirely
[1:04:33] from our sins and would present us
[1:04:36] spotless before himself with exceeding
[1:04:39] great joy Revelation 1 5 he has washed
[1:04:42] Us in his own blood Revelation 1 6. now
[1:04:45] watch after the Washington comes 1 6 and
[1:04:48] hath made us amen Kings and Priests unto
[1:04:52] God right after the washing amen comes
[1:04:55] in identification that you're not just a
[1:04:57] wash church member but you was washed
[1:04:59] for a purpose you were washed to become
[1:05:02] a king and a priest unto God
[1:05:04] oh God wash first you were washed first
[1:05:09] now come on Church you were washed first
[1:05:11] but now watch a prophet and then
[1:05:13] anointed for service
[1:05:16] it you were washed first and then
[1:05:19] anointed for service amen see you've
[1:05:21] been washed and anointed brother brother
[1:05:23] brother Elise what have we been washed
[1:05:25] for what have we been anointed for to
[1:05:27] bring forth a testimony for God said now
[1:05:31] watch in First Corinthians 5 he says
[1:05:33] read it now to whip that God was in
[1:05:35] Christ reconciling the world unto
[1:05:37] himself not imputing their trespasses
[1:05:39] unto them and hath committed unto us
[1:05:42] amen the word of reconciliation are you
[1:05:45] ready for this amen that Christ was
[1:05:47] God's testimony because God was in
[1:05:50] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[1:05:53] amen God was in Christ reconciling the
[1:05:57] so what was Christ doing he was bringing
[1:05:59] forth the testimony of God now come on
[1:06:02] church let me preach because all that
[1:06:04] was in God he poured into Christ and all
[1:06:08] that was in Christ he poured into the
[1:06:10] church then Church of the Living God
[1:06:12] you've not been brought on the earth to
[1:06:15] be a slave to depression to be a slave
[1:06:17] to Suicide to do a service under the
[1:06:20] world you have been liberated by the
[1:06:22] washing of the water of the word to
[1:06:24] bring forth the testimony unto God
[1:06:27] you're not put here to do la Odyssey a
[1:06:30] service you're here to do God a service
[1:06:32] you're not here come on don't get mad at
[1:06:34] me you're not here to do education a
[1:06:36] service you're here to do God a service
[1:06:38] come on adults you're not here Amen to
[1:06:41] put your business on the map your
[1:06:43] business on this Earth is to do God as
[1:06:45] service and everything everything
[1:06:48] everything falls secondarily to the word
[1:06:51] of God having preeminence
[1:06:56] you're here to do a service now I think
[1:06:59] it's amazing because I'm just gonna I'm
[1:07:01] gonna slow down and read this I
[1:07:03] love this because who else could go to
[1:07:05] the Book of Matthew 3 like a prophet and
[1:07:08] could go back and could rehearse to you
[1:07:10] a conversation between John and Jesus
[1:07:14] he said now and Reverend picks it up he
[1:07:16] said now he said so for this to be so he
[1:07:18] said that's right in other words now
[1:07:19] listen to this John now now John here is
[1:07:22] asking for the Bible he's asking why do
[1:07:24] I need to baptize you you need to
[1:07:26] baptize me he's got all these questions
[1:07:28] but what he don't realize is John has a
[1:07:31] position he has a place in life to
[1:07:34] confirm
[1:07:35] and Jesus says John you're a mighty man
[1:07:38] you're a great man you're a mighty
[1:07:39] prophet
[1:07:41] your revelation of me is exactly the
[1:07:44] truth you know who I am you know because
[1:07:47] your ministry didn't come from man your
[1:07:49] ministry came from God you never learned
[1:07:52] it of man you wasn't taught this in a
[1:07:53] seminary but at the age of nine years
[1:07:56] old you went into the Wilderness because
[1:07:58] you were born an odd peculiar child and
[1:08:00] from your very birth God began to deal
[1:08:02] with you and even before your birth the
[1:08:05] prophet saw you and you are alive to
[1:08:07] this day now watch this you know who I
[1:08:10] am you know who I am because God in the
[1:08:15] wilderness told you there'd be a sign
[1:08:17] following me and you've already bore
[1:08:19] witness of it and you know it and we
[1:08:21] know who each other are we know each
[1:08:23] other and it is true that you need to be
[1:08:26] baptized to me but let's suffer that to
[1:08:28] be so for John if we are the lights of
[1:08:31] this day if we are the lies of this day
[1:08:35] then we must fulfill all righteousness
[1:08:38] all of God's word must be fulfilled by
[1:08:41] us for this day for it is becoming to us
[1:08:44] it is behooving it is becoming it is
[1:08:47] like us for if we are the true Witnesses
[1:08:50] of God today then John we are the lights
[1:08:53] of this age and if we are the lots of
[1:08:55] this age there's so much scripture
[1:08:57] that's got to be fulfilled during this
[1:08:59] age and it's up to us hallelujah it's up
[1:09:03] to us to see amen that all of God's
[1:09:06] righteousness is fulfilled and what is
[1:09:08] his righteousness it's his word so
[1:09:10] before Jesus sat down and had a youth
[1:09:13] service with John on a Saturday
[1:09:15] afternoon and looked at him face to face
[1:09:17] and said John you're here for a greater
[1:09:20] purpose you're here to do more than just
[1:09:22] run the woods you're here to do more
[1:09:24] than just eat the locusts and the Honey
[1:09:25] amen but you are here because you are
[1:09:28] the light of this day John you got a
[1:09:31] commission upon your life you got a
[1:09:33] purpose upon your life and the prayer to
[1:09:35] God said every age had light
[1:09:39] I don't know how to do this maybe like
[1:09:41] this you know brother Wade it'd be like
[1:09:43] me and you sit down here you know and we
[1:09:45] talk and you're sitting over there and
[1:09:46] I'm sitting here and you say now brother
[1:09:48] Andrew we're gonna go in this building
[1:09:49] we're going to tear out the walls we're
[1:09:51] going to build a new wall we're going to
[1:09:52] lay a new floor we're going to paint the
[1:09:54] ceiling we're talking about this and I'm
[1:09:56] saying but brother brother Wade who's

[1:17:21] Noah knew his position and you know what
[1:17:23] no one knew he knew brother it was
[1:17:25] becoming of him to build the ark he knew
[1:17:28] the plan for his day Noah was criticized
[1:17:31] but listen what the prophet of God
[1:17:32] saying he said no matter how much they
[1:17:34] saved they're so they're such and
[1:17:37] there's no such a thing as the Holy
[1:17:38] Ghost there's no such a thing as Divine
[1:17:40] heal him it behootheth us it is becoming
[1:17:43] to us that we fulfill all righteousness
[1:17:46] are you ready for this that we stand in
[1:17:49] this hour of trial and pound away at the
[1:17:52] Ark of the Lord what are you saying
[1:17:54] preacher I'm saying this what is
[1:17:56] becoming to the believer
[1:17:58] is Unbecoming to the critic and what is
[1:18:02] Unbecoming to the critic is becoming to
[1:18:04] the believer that's why Peter said amen
[1:18:07] knowing this verse that there shall come
[1:18:08] in the last days scoffers who will walk
[1:18:11] after their own lust Jude 1 16 there are
[1:18:14] murmurs complainers I hope they're not
[1:18:16] here murmurous complainers walking after
[1:18:19] their own lust and their mouths speaketh
[1:18:21] great swelling words having men's
[1:18:23] persons in admiration because of
[1:18:26] Advantage but beloved remember ye The
[1:18:28] Words which were spoken before the
[1:18:30] Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ how
[1:18:32] did they told you there should be
[1:18:34] mockers in the last time we should who
[1:18:36] should walk after their own ungodly lust
[1:18:39] can I say this to you it become just as
[1:18:43] it becomes John to baptize Jesus it
[1:18:46] becomes the critic to criticize
[1:18:50] it falls their lot that's what they was
[1:18:53] brought on the earth to do was
[1:18:55] criticized well brother Andrew I tell
[1:18:57] you what one of these days precious name
[1:18:59] when they quit criticizing me I'm gonna
[1:19:01] do something for god well I'll see you
[1:19:03] in another 10 years of time tarries and
[1:19:05] you'll still be saying the same thing
[1:19:06] because the critic is never going to
[1:19:08] stop criticizing no matter if you call
[1:19:11] them up and ask them how they wanted it
[1:19:13] done and did everything to the T they
[1:19:15] would still find some little something
[1:19:17] that didn't get done and they would
[1:19:19] criticize you but you got to learn to
[1:19:21] walk as a Believer and if you're going
[1:19:23] to walk as a Believer you've got to walk
[1:19:25] unconscious of criticism
[1:19:27] the Bible said that Jesus had given us
[1:19:30] an example that we should do unto others
[1:19:32] as he has done to you remember I said
[1:19:34] now watch are you ready for this anybody
[1:19:36] ever been criticized
[1:19:38] three of you four of you you ever been
[1:19:40] criticized he said when he came in the
[1:19:42] world when there was more as much
[1:19:43] unbelief in this world right then as
[1:19:45] there ever was it didn't even slow him
[1:19:48] up
[1:19:49] he went right on preaching just the same
[1:19:51] healing just the same it never bothered
[1:19:54] him there was critics the man was
[1:19:56] criticized from the time he was a baby
[1:19:59] until he died on the cross did it stop
[1:20:01] him no sir
[1:20:05] well let me say this if criticism didn't
[1:20:08] stop the head it will not stop the body
[1:20:12] if criticism didn't stop Mr Jesus Christ
[1:20:14] it will not stop Mrs Jesus it was
[1:20:17] because of Daniel
[1:20:19] amen it was becoming of Daniel to stand
[1:20:22] for the word in the face of idolatry
[1:20:24] amen it was becoming of a Christian to
[1:20:27] be it's it's Unbecoming of a Christian
[1:20:29] to be ashamed I love what Paul says he
[1:20:32] says listen church I'm not ashamed of
[1:20:34] the gospel of Christ it is the power of
[1:20:37] God and the Salvation to everyone that
[1:20:39] believeth to the Jew first and also to
[1:20:42] the Greek brother said because it's
[1:20:44] becoming to a Christian not to be
[1:20:46] ashamed of your religion come on young
[1:20:48] people lose your lose your embarrassment
[1:20:51] of this message lose your embarrassment
[1:20:53] of the church you go to come on I'm
[1:20:55] going to preach to you amen you got to
[1:20:56] lose that you got to quit getting all
[1:20:58] blessed you know all red face when
[1:21:00] somebody asks you what you believe
[1:21:04] come on you got to take a stand and you
[1:21:06] got to let this world know I believe
[1:21:08] this message and you got to know what
[1:21:10] you believe from the Bible so you can
[1:21:12] back every devil in the corner up and
[1:21:14] say this is not a man's idea let's just
[1:21:16] not following men's words for Advantage
[1:21:18] this is following Vindicated word it's a
[1:21:21] it's a oh God and I'm not ashamed of
[1:21:24] this message I'm not ashamed of this
[1:21:26] prophet
[1:21:28] I might as well go attack another devil
[1:21:30] while I'm here and don't ever be ashamed
[1:21:32] of the church God put you in
[1:21:34] amen
[1:21:35] can I take some Liberty don't you ever
[1:21:38] be ashamed if God puts you in a word
[1:21:40] based message teaching Holy Ghost Field
[1:21:43] fire baptized church that believes this
[1:21:45] message and gives this message premium
[1:21:47] don't you let some devil of carnal
[1:21:50] comparisons amen anoint you to compare
[1:21:52] your church with some other church and
[1:21:55] say well if this church he do this and
[1:21:57] if that's her well God I'm here I might
[1:22:00] as well preach and now it's got down to
[1:22:01] where well if this church ain't doing
[1:22:03] this it's a dead church and if that
[1:22:05] church ain't doing this amen but when in
[1:22:07] God's name did we put the measuring
[1:22:09] stick in the hand that some preacher to
[1:22:11] identify what is life and what is death
[1:22:13] what identifies life and what identifies
[1:22:16] death is the message of the hour and if
[1:22:19] the church is in the word of God you
[1:22:21] want to get behind the vision
[1:22:24] it's a devil that crawling out of the
[1:22:26] pits of Hell of carnal comparisons
[1:22:30] they don't do it like we do well they
[1:22:32] ain't you
[1:22:34] listen I've been evangelizing I started
[1:22:36] preaching when I was 13. I've been been
[1:22:38] traveling since I was 16 by myself on
[1:22:41] the road preaching I preached in
[1:22:42] churches God's give me Grace to preach
[1:22:44] in churches all over this world but you
[1:22:46] know what I can't do I cannot come to
[1:22:49] Lula and see how they do it Lula and go
[1:22:51] to go to go to Alabama and tell them how
[1:22:53] to do it in Alabama like they did in
[1:22:54] Lula
[1:22:55] all right come on church I cannot go to
[1:22:59] Canada and tell them to do it in Canada
[1:23:01] like we do in Virginia every church is
[1:23:04] Sovereign in itself
[1:23:05] [Music]
[1:23:07] you know what brings us on the same page
[1:23:09] is the message of the hour
[1:23:12] so if we're all preaching the message
[1:23:14] then we ought to be able to go in each
[1:23:15] other's church and have good Fellowship
[1:23:17] because the basis of Fellowship I hope
[1:23:20] that's okay the basis of Fellowship is
[1:23:23] the message that's why Paul was saying
[1:23:25] don't you ever be ashamed of the Gospel
[1:23:26] that's what you are not ashamed of the
[1:23:29] Gospel it's the thing are you ready for
[1:23:31] this it's the thing that holds in the
[1:23:34] hours when the ship is rocking and every
[1:23:36] stars outside and the moon and the stars
[1:23:39] and the storms are blowing but it still
[1:23:41] holds it's the Gospel of Jesus Christ in
[1:23:44] Genesis 22 it was becoming of Abraham
[1:23:47] when he walked up there to sacrifice
[1:23:49] Isaac it was becoming of Abraham to
[1:23:51] separate from unbelief and acts the
[1:23:54] second chapter it was becoming of the
[1:23:56] disciples at Pentecost to go to the
[1:23:58] upper room and to receive power in Acts
[1:24:00] 3 it was becoming a Peter and to John to
[1:24:03] speak the word over the lame man it's a
[1:24:05] gate called Beautiful
[1:24:08] it fell there a lot
[1:24:12] now I'm going to close on this one
[1:24:16] said look here at Enoch
[1:24:18] in paragraph 126 it become a first to
[1:24:20] fulfill our is this okay
[1:24:22] to fulfill our righteousness in the days
[1:24:25] of Enoch just before the flood when
[1:24:27] Enoch looked out there and saw Noah
[1:24:29] building away on the ark Enoch was a
[1:24:31] prophet now watch Enoch knew that he was
[1:24:34] a type
[1:24:35] Enoch knew that he was a type and he
[1:24:38] knew that before the floods came that he
[1:24:40] had to give an example so one afternoon
[1:24:43] it was becoming to him to take a walk
[1:24:47] brother brother Wade it was becoming of
[1:24:49] Enoch it fell his lot it behooved him it
[1:24:53] was conspicuous of him to be to be
[1:24:56] translated without seeing death because
[1:24:59] Enoch knew he was a type of rapture he
[1:25:02] meant to go before the floods came can I
[1:25:04] can I lay some word to you young people
[1:25:06] it's in Genesis 5 22 the Bible said that
[1:25:10] Enoch walked with God after he began
[1:25:12] Methuselah 300 years and he began Sons
[1:25:15] and Daughters listen Enoch was a family
[1:25:18] man he had a wife he had babies he had
[1:25:21] grandbabies but all the days of Enoch
[1:25:23] were 360 and five years but in all that
[1:25:27] brother brother in all that Enoch walked
[1:25:30] with God and he was not for God took him
[1:25:33] you know what Enoch means it means
[1:25:35] dedicated you know what no matter how
[1:25:38] dedicated Enoch was he was still in a
[1:25:41] battle you know what he did he battled
[1:25:43] with the position listen sometimes we're
[1:25:45] going to battle with the position that
[1:25:47] God called us to but Enoch was an
[1:25:50] example that whatever position God calls
[1:25:53] you to you can walk with God
[1:25:55] if he calls you to be a preacher you're
[1:25:58] going to walk with God if he calls you
[1:26:00] to be a Sunday school teacher you've got
[1:26:01] to walk with God if he calls you to be a
[1:26:04] housewife come on Church you're going to
[1:26:06] walk with God because how is he not
[1:26:08] walking brother Louise by faith my faith
[1:26:11] Enoch was translated that he should not
[1:26:13] see death and was not found because God
[1:26:17] had translated him for before somebody
[1:26:19] preached with me now before
[1:26:23] before
[1:26:25] before his translation he had this
[1:26:30] testimony that he pleased God not after
[1:26:33] he was translated but before he was
[1:26:35] translated he could testify that his
[1:26:38] life was pleasing to God you know what
[1:26:40] the prophet of God said he said faith is
[1:26:42] unconscious you've got faith and don't
[1:26:45] even know it that's right Jesus Christ
[1:26:47] no matter if he was in a storm and the
[1:26:50] gaels were knocking the boat from one
[1:26:52] side of the other or he was standing in
[1:26:54] the face of masses of demons if he was
[1:26:56] hanging anywhere it never moved him he

[1:32:29] that led Israel man that same Ministry
[1:32:32] that accompanied Jesus Christ by that
[1:32:34] Pillar of Fire that had him anointed is
[1:32:35] a company in the church today scientists
[1:32:37] proved it we didn't need that but God
[1:32:38] proved it we need the ministry of Jesus
[1:32:41] Christ to fit that headstone coming
[1:32:43] Yonder that's brought the church into a
[1:32:45] place where this ministry is exactly
[1:32:47] like it was when Jesus left
[1:32:51] let our musicians come this afternoon
[1:32:54] what are you saying preacher
[1:32:56] I'm saying it's your turn to stand
[1:33:00] Noah stood
[1:33:02] Enoch stood
[1:33:04] Daniel stood
[1:33:06] Paul stood
[1:33:07] Peter stood
[1:33:09] brother branhamsted
[1:33:13] now it's your turn to stand there
[1:33:17] it's your turn to stand
[1:33:19] I want you once you stand with us this
[1:33:22] afternoon
[1:33:24] it's your turn to stand
[1:33:27] you know
[1:33:28] I wanna I wanna leave this with you
[1:33:30] right here
[1:33:32] when you brother Brandon says it very
[1:33:34] beautiful he says now
[1:33:35] when you say I believe Jesus Christ is
[1:33:38] my healer I believe this morning he's
[1:33:40] going to heal my sick body something
[1:33:42] told me to come to church I'm here among
[1:33:44] the Believers I'm taking my stand this
[1:33:46] morning I believe it I'm going up to be
[1:33:48] prayed for
[1:33:49] now what I'm prayed for they're on that
[1:33:52] stand I'll remain no matter how dark it
[1:33:55] gets or where it's at it's what I want
[1:33:57] it's what I want you to take home with
[1:33:59] you Church
[1:34:00] I'll still stand on that stand
[1:34:04] I'll still stand on that stand
[1:34:08] you took your stand because it's
[1:34:10] becoming to you after you once made a
[1:34:13] confession you must stay with your
[1:34:15] confession that's right it's behooving
[1:34:17] you as a Christian as a Believer to stay
[1:34:19] with your conviction don't let the devil
[1:34:21] push you off here and there you're
[1:34:23] always muddied up you're always off the
[1:34:25] main road you're always in and out
[1:34:26] that's why you can't stay nowhere you
[1:34:28] can't have confidence in yourself or you
[1:34:30] can't no one can have confidence in you
[1:34:32] you've got to stand
[1:34:34] and when you've done all you can do to
[1:34:36] stand then stand amen just keep on
[1:34:39] standing that's right we must do that
[1:34:42] it's becoming to us it's behooving us
[1:34:46] that we do it
[1:34:48] how many can say I want to stand there
[1:34:50] amen I take my stand
[1:34:54] my position
[1:34:56] is my stand amen
[1:34:58] my position
[1:35:01] my inheritance
[1:35:02] will not be taken from me
[1:35:05] I'm going to take my stand
[1:35:07] Peter did that's right Enoch did
[1:35:11] he said brother Andrew they all had it
[1:35:12] easy
[1:35:13] they were Bible characters they had it
[1:35:16] all
[1:35:17] they had it all easy brother Zach I mean
[1:35:18] it was just easy for them what are you
[1:35:20] doing brother said Enoch didn't want to
[1:35:22] leave
[1:35:23] do you realize Enoch left his family
[1:35:25] when he didn't want to to fulfill a type
[1:35:27] for you
[1:35:30] because there had to be a top for the
[1:35:32] seventh from Adam to take a change one
[1:35:33] day without seeing death
[1:35:36] there had to be somebody walk like Enoch
[1:35:39] walked
[1:35:40] there had to be there had to be somebody
[1:35:42] so it fell Enoch's lot to do it
[1:35:45] and he didn't want to leave his family
[1:35:47] he didn't want to leave his wife he
[1:35:49] loved his home probably
[1:35:51] they had to walk
[1:35:53] what are you saying I'm saying there's
[1:35:55] going to be times you got to do things
[1:35:57] you don't want to do
[1:35:59] but it behooves you to do it
[1:36:03] part of your lot
[1:36:05] so what do you do not do it and not
[1:36:07] fulfill the will of God
[1:36:09] or say Lord I'm gonna put my nose to it
[1:36:12] I've been anointed to fulfill this
[1:36:15] position
[1:36:16] there's going to be a resurrection
[1:36:18] there's going to be a rapture
[1:36:20] there's going to be a new heavens and a
[1:36:22] new Earth
[1:36:23] there's going to be a body change
[1:36:24] there's going to be a marriage supper of
[1:36:27] the Lamb
[1:36:28] and only the righteous will be there
[1:36:31] can I say it this way only the ones who
[1:36:33] fulfilled his word in the age and day
[1:36:37] they were living
[1:36:39] we'll be a part of it how many say Lord
[1:36:42] give me courage
[1:36:43] Lord give me courage
[1:36:45] give me courage sometimes I just get to
[1:36:48] thinking brother Bob where would we be
[1:36:51] had people give up their stand yeah
[1:36:54] where would we be
[1:36:55] I think about you in this church where
[1:36:57] would you be today if brother Dale give
[1:36:58] up his stand
[1:37:00] somewhere along the way
[1:37:02] just backed up a little bit and said
[1:37:03] well you know I guess we could probably
[1:37:04] read
[1:37:06] but he stood there
[1:37:09] declaring this message
[1:37:11] you know why because it failed his lot
[1:37:14] well it follows your life to stand in
[1:37:16] your home
[1:37:17] to uphold convictions in your home
[1:37:20] I don't know why I'm here but I'm here
[1:37:22] on this point right here do not tamper
[1:37:26] with an eternally right word
[1:37:28] for a temporary situation
[1:37:33] don't tamper with it
[1:37:35] well but then we're just going to change
[1:37:36] a few things here in the message in the
[1:37:38] word we're going to do a few things yeah
[1:37:40] I had a guy tell me that one time he
[1:37:41] said oh God I get in trouble he told me
[1:37:44] he said yeah he said brother and he said
[1:37:45] I got a television I said oh really he
[1:37:46] said yeah he said yeah when I said my
[1:37:49] son growing up he said I think he had
[1:37:51] like three or four or five boys you know
[1:37:52] had some Sons he said yeah he said I had
[1:37:54] a my son he said he wanted television he
[1:37:56] said we wouldn't get one because you
[1:37:57] know brother I'm taught not to have one
[1:37:58] that's why that's what he taught he said
[1:38:00] well I got one I said Well why'd you do
[1:38:02] that he said well I found out my son was
[1:38:04] going over to other people's houses
[1:38:05] watching it and so he thought well I
[1:38:07] just bring one in the house and he can
[1:38:08] watch it here and we'll be at least
[1:38:09] he'll know what he's watching you know
[1:38:12] I'm sitting there scratching my head I'm
[1:38:13] thinking
[1:38:15] they're all out of the house and the
[1:38:17] television's still in there
[1:38:20] hello
[1:38:22] we'll just give up a little bit here and
[1:38:23] it's okay and then before long the devil
[1:38:25] gets a foothold
[1:38:27] come on Daddy's makeup comes in your
[1:38:29] homie might as well stand with a profit
[1:38:31] because
[1:38:33] we gotta go eat
[1:38:35] the message is Right regardless of the
[1:38:37] situation
[1:38:39] regardless of who it is what home what
[1:38:41] family
[1:38:43] the message is right
[1:38:45] so if you stand on the message then
[1:38:47] you'll always be right
[1:38:49] but if you change it a little bit well
[1:38:51] we're gonna give a little Grace well
[1:38:53] it's a message of Grace So stand on it
[1:38:56] stand on your stand how many can say

[1:45:35] father I see the Lamborghinis people
[1:45:41] [Music]
[1:45:44] but of the seals
[1:45:47] [Music]
[1:45:52] [Applause]
[1:45:54] [Music]
[1:46:24] I surrendered
[1:46:30] once again
[1:46:33] [Music]
[1:46:38] generation of the sons and that the
[1:46:41] generation of the people that's going to
[1:46:44] take a Rapture and a body change
[1:46:52] [Music]
[1:47:00] amen you love the Lord
[1:47:02] let the worshiper arise come up out of
[1:47:05] this place
[1:47:06] I was thinking when you was preaching I
[1:47:07] thought man that's true God has never
[1:47:10] there's always been a cycle of God
[1:47:12] somewhere on the Earth amen may not have
[1:47:15] been in your generation at where you
[1:47:17] were standing but in somebody's
[1:47:18] generation there always was a bride amen
[1:47:21] when he come under their Pentecost he
[1:47:23] never put a gap anywhere because God's
[1:47:25] moving all the time he's moving he's
[1:47:28] moving through his people and you think
[1:47:30] well who well if you figure out it's you
[1:47:33] then you don't have to worry about
[1:47:34] anybody else hey man Enoch kind of
[1:47:37] figured out he said there's something
[1:47:39] going on here and uh
[1:47:41] I don't know I don't know what's going
[1:47:43] on
[1:47:45] but I gotta go amen because the Bible
[1:47:47] said he walked with God he didn't
[1:47:49] surround he walked with God that's right
[1:47:51] and he was not amen because God took him
[1:47:54] well that's what he's doing in the every
[1:47:55] generation God took a people but he's
[1:47:58] going to take a people by a body change
[1:48:02] correct destroying death where they
[1:48:05] stand on their own two feet it could be
[1:48:07] a young kid could be an old guy it
[1:48:09] really doesn't matter
[1:48:11] what does that matter to God but we're
[1:48:13] heading towards something we're walking
[1:48:15] as our brother said this it's a paradox
[1:48:17] though Paul said let's run but our
[1:48:20] brother said let's stand well it's the
[1:48:21] same identical thing that's right
[1:48:23] because you're not standing sleeping
[1:48:24] you're you're taking a stand on what you
[1:48:26] believe right right amen amen and as we
[1:48:29] move forward you take a stand as you
[1:48:32] move forward like I said every
[1:48:33] generation I've got a little sermon on
[1:48:35] that that's good now every generation
[1:48:36] though
[1:48:37] Aina left his generation but there was
[1:48:40] still a generation of people that came
[1:48:42] through
[1:48:42] Methuselah all the different ones and
[1:48:45] that's why the Bible gives you genealogy
[1:48:47] tells you that God has been he just
[1:48:49] there's a big strand of God that just he
[1:48:51] just pulled it out and said I'm gonna
[1:48:52] have people everywhere there's not going
[1:48:54] to be a gap
[1:48:56] and I'm gonna put the best
[1:48:58] at the last that's right I'm gonna put
[1:49:01] the best that's the last that can handle
[1:49:03] it they can take it Enoch took it then
[1:49:06] we're going to take it now but it's by
[1:49:09] listening to the word of God it's the
[1:49:10] washing of the Water by the word you're
[1:49:13] not going to get it any other way you're
[1:49:14] gonna get you're going to get watched by
[1:49:16] the word can't get it sitting at home
[1:49:18] no no you gotta get on the fountain
[1:49:21] that's right this is the fountain that's
[1:49:22] right Elijah brother said the the
[1:49:24] message of the hour is what we stand on
[1:49:27] and if it's true then we're true that's
[1:49:30] right amen I like my brother Ernie
[1:49:31] Villanueva always said he said we have
[1:49:33] plugged ourselves into the Eternal and
[1:49:36] that's what I like because it's Eternal
[1:49:37] and you decide and you plug yourself
[1:49:39] into that well guess what that does that
[1:49:41] puts the current back inside of you and
[1:49:43] makes you
[1:49:44] oh wow anytime you touch Eternal hey
[1:49:49] eternity is the only thing that can come
[1:49:50] from it and man so we we have we have
[1:49:53] plugged ourselves into the Eternal and
[1:49:54] then we're just Eternal people that
[1:49:56] think different talk different act
[1:49:57] different and we look different yes amen
[1:50:00] so let's give our brother another big
[1:50:02] ham and God bless him he's always poured
[1:50:04] his heart out he's always been a
[1:50:07] somebody that stands for the truth and I
[1:50:09] appreciate that and always have
[1:50:12] appreciated him since he was I've known
[1:50:14] him since he was about 14 years old when
[1:50:16] somebody when brother uh Bill yountz had
[1:50:18] to haul him around to preach and I
[1:50:20] remember that kid
[1:50:22] so it but he stood for the word even as
[1:50:25] a young kid when other people were you
[1:50:28] know doing other things he was studying
[1:50:30] the message and it sure has made an
[1:50:33] impact
[1:50:34] on the world he said he's going to New
[1:50:37] Zealand in about another month so let's
[1:50:40] just pray for him there there and and
