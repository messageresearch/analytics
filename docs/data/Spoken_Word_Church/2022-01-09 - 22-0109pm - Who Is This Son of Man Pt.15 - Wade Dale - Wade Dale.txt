easter meeting friday saturday and sunday the 15th 16th and 17th of april and uh brother tim cross and brother mike olteagle probably doing doing the services i i was telling bob you know we always you wonder how people um dad would do it too but you get somebody on your heart you know you you praying about i don't want to just bring anybody people here that's it's not going to help y'all i want to bring somebody here that'll help you and uh and not hurt you and uh i asked brother dan daisy one time i said how do you know if you know who you're gonna call cause he called me one time he said brother wait i can't get you off my mind you've been on you've been in my in my mind on the plane trip coming back from africa i said boy that's pretty scary but he said that's the way i get my bring people in he said he said now if i think about him one time it's not a problem he said but now if i just keep getting impressed that your name keeps coming up he said i usually call and pray you come and preach and we have good services so that's kind of the way i've been doing is praying for a couple of people i know brother mike ulti just went through uh open heart surgery but i did call him and he's been preaching um a good bit at his church so he's doing better just keep him in your prayer and just remember all these things remember the ones that are sick the ones that are not here let's bow our heads dear lord thank you for this day that you give us i ask you lord you forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make against you lord i pray father now that you'll be the active participant in this service lord that you'll take over as we were talking about this morning the lord may what be said today will be said lord straight from the mind of god and i pray that the people lord will take this and chew on it and may it be meat lord and may it be something that will nourish him lord for the week ahead we know that satan would love to destroy every one of us but lord i pray lord that you will be with us you said you would raise up a standard you said you'd be with us and never forsake us and you never put on us any more than we can stand so father we take those promises and we hold on to them lord we ask just be with the ones lord that are on the on the highways traveling back and forth we pray that you'd be with them lord be with a little bride all around the world lord take care of us we're your bride lord you said you would so lord it's been a long journey many have fought the battle but lord there's victory there's victory in you i pray that you'll just be with us now and furthermore this service in jesus name we pray amen john 1 1. in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god let's drop down to verse 10. he was in the world we were talking this morning the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of flesh nor the will of man but of god and this word was made flesh whatever we were talking about all that up there from 1 through 13 we were talking about john and then talking about the lord jesus the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory of the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word and we'll go ahead and go to hebrews 10. we've read this before but i want you to really understand that wherefore he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice an offering thou would have not in other words it wasn't the sacrifices it wasn't the offerings that didn't now it did bring jesus christ on the scene but that wasn't jesus christ the offerings in the old testament was not jesus it was a pre-figure or it was an example of the one sacrifice as we looked in the book of hebrews and bob going through it where it says that that sacrifice doesn't have to be made over and over again jesus christ was a was the supreme sacrifice no other sacrifice is needed after that i hope we see that and the bible tells us though that we need to be the sacrifice we need to sacrifice our life amen which is our reasonable service the bible tells us to sacrifice and you know i was watching the young ladies don't come girls anymore the young lady up here singing i thought god that's what you wanted that is what you saw before the foundation of the world nice beautiful young ladies long hair innocent yes virgin doing the work that they were given to do be able to sing be able to play an instrument how many instruments can you play 20 30. i don't like you i always pick on her cause she's left-handed too so she can take it i hope but no you see what i mean though you look at that picture but you go out and go look at the world listen go pick me three girls out of the world uh-uh you're not going to get that kind of character you're not going to get that and if nothing else we get out of this message of the hour that we love so well and to talk about the seals and the daniel 70 weeks and all this it's the life that we're projecting to the world that yes we are different and we can be different see that's a testimony that those girls can stand here and be above the world not do as the world i'm talking about all you sisters that do that but they were up here and i was going god that picture that picture that's what you wanted you wanted a pure virtuous sinless bride without spot or wrinkle singing the praises of god playing the instruments and not doing it for show or money or doing it for the glory of god amen amen don't ever lose that don't ever lose that young ladies young men young ladies don't ever lose that you're in this world but you don't have to be of this world this world will drag you down tear you up spit you out and never turn around and look at you again amen that's what the devil will do if he ever gets him gets you a little bit now i know we all have testimonies but i can testify myself that i wasn't a good guy but god saved my soul i wasted 20 years of my life wasted it because it gained me nothing right right oh yeah i was a good guy i was a good husband i was good at this and get that i was worthless and you're worthless without god you're worthless it's like brother john said perfect example where are you going to end up if bill gates doesn't get the baptism of the holy ghost he's going to hell i don't care how much money you make amen because he didn't accept jesus christ as a savior the simplest thing you can do and a billionaire can't do that that's the god we serve made it so simple yes i don't know why i'm doing this man but it's so simple that not one person that hits this earth and breathes a breath does not have that same opportunity every person it's all no over in india no if you have a desire in your heart god will send somebody over there amen god will send you somebody if you have a desire because you know what he said he would give you the desire of your heart and the desire of your heart is what either to serve god or serve the devil one of the two there's not anything in between amen that's why we counsel with the girls and counsel or young ladies and counsel with the young men and have these youth youth meetings and stuff to to get them to feel important number one they're important they're important to us they're important to god but to keep yourself clean to keep yourself away from the world and the things of the world because listen a lot of us didn't and we carry scholars and that's why we want to be so adamant about sheltering and preaching and teaching and doing these things for the youth so that you won't make the same mistakes we did amen so you can be a as we're talking about today a sinless virtuous bride of jesus christ because you get born again that's what you are oh you got problems in your flesh sure and problems in your spirit realm but not in your soul your soul is just as eternal as god is it is the eternal of god amen so let's continue here hebrews 10 5 a body has now prepared me we were talking about this morning there's a literal body that was prepared that came onto this earth 2 000 years ago in a city called bethlehem not on december the 25th but in april and he brought a natural body in but the only reason that natural body came is is because in the garden of eden there was a marriage between adam and eve but that marriage didn't get consummated like god wanted it consummated the devil stepped in and he consummated it to a beast and that's what caused all this that we're dealing with now but god knew that so he sent he had to come in a literal body to then begin to build his spiritual body amen that's what he was telling nicodemus he's a nicodemus your first birth is not it's what's killing you you need another birth that's fine i'll read here in just a few minutes where brother branham told us and we've read it many times but we were going to read it again where he said i don't i just don't know that we're getting them to christ and are we i want to ask you a question are we getting our kids and our um and our wives and husbands that don't serve the lord in different ones are we getting them to christ or we're just saying you got to believe this message you got to believe this message well get them to christ first you get them nailed into christ and i'll promise you promise you they'll come to the message amen they'll come to the message of the hour but they've got to get the new birth first because the new birth is not the message of the hour in that form that is just the message of the hour no the new birth is knowing that jesus christ died for your soul gave his soul a ransom so he could see his seed and that's what you are you are the seed of god as brother bob was talking about this morning so the marriage vows were were were marred in the garden jesus christ came and remember he didn't get married because he didn't need to be married he was looking for a spiritual bride that was going to though become flesh listen that's why he didn't when he created the genesis 1 26 man that was a spirit man that didn't have flesh i was a spirit man but see god didn't want to keep that because he showed what he wanted to do when he dropped down into 2 7 genesis 2 verse 7 and said i'm going to put that in human flesh that's what he wanted to do he wanted always to live with us in human flesh always that way he can fellowship with us remember he fellowship with adam he fellowship with eve he went down and through the garden and fellowship with him in the garden adam and eve that was his wife they had just not consummated the marriage and i don't think they have to consummate it like we consummated now because it's a spoken word of god not by sex is anything worth anything amen but we have to have it to get here so it's all right because um it's permitted by god okay the bed's undefiled so just don't worry don't when we talk about i don't want you to see those two schools of thought you don't want to say well sex is bad it's not if it's done right it's like brother brown said everything's right if it's done right it's not if it's done wrong so you go do it right ladies and gentlemen and then whatever that that's then that's sanctioned by god the same way with anything with god amen what brother brown said adultery is what adulterous act is against god but the right act is ordained of god amen same act but you got to go the right way all right that's why the marriage in divorce situation we don't we're not going to get into it but that's what messed up the beginning that's why brother brown had to preach marriage in divorce it's because the marriage vows is what got missing in the in the in the garden it was the adam and eve were presented and said here here this is this is what you're going to do multiply and replenish the earth satan jumps right in the middle of it and brings his own thought into it through the beast and he commits adultery we leave so then god said okay don't worry i'll put enmity between you there's a division now between me and you but i'm going to bring it back together because of the woman's seed which is the person we're talking about the literal body of jesus christ had to come on this earth so that the spiritual body could come out of it and then that spiritual body though whether we go by the grave or whether we go to the body change we're all going to be in human flesh for an eternity because jesus christ what he didn't throw his flesh away and get him a new one when he resurrected he resurrected in the same flesh or there would have been something left in the tomb huh there would have been something left in the tomb that is an empty tomb there's nothing in there because whatever was in there is out right and then he came back on the day of pentecost in the baptism of the holy ghost into your flesh and now we can say the word has been made flesh again you and i are the word made flesh if you have the baptism of the holy ghost ephesians 5 23 said for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body which that's what you and i we are the body all right let's go to colossians 1 15 i want to hurry through this and get to something at the end who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature he was born right now we can't help being born wrong not one of you decided to be born okay you did not decide that it was the divine providence of god that got you here amen mean what brother brown said he said it's more a miracle for the natural birth than it is for the virgin birth virgin birth was one seed one germ put in the womb of mary and there's baby jesus that's not don't happen with us this one and this one this one and this one why do you say that this one was bred to this one to get you here that's a miracle but he had to be the firstborn of every creature because listen our first birth killed us his first birth saved us he didn't need a new birth he didn't say nicodemus now me and you need to be born again now he said nicodemus you need to be born again because you came a different way than i did see nicodemus couldn't understand that because what's the first thing he said he said if i got to go back and get into my mother's womb see natural right and be born again no then that's going to kill you again so you got to be born jesus said what from above you're born from above you're born from heaven sitting in heavenly places but he had to be the firstborn there had to be one come to the first fruits there had to be one that lived these virtues there had to be one that lived joy peace longsuffering and all that he had to be the example we had to have an example amen and it wasn't it wasn't given to a man now listen isaiah had a part jeremiah had a part ezekiel had a part david had a part solomon had a part each one of them had a part but they weren't the fullness so they finished their work in malachi and then it took four you know when you flip that page from malachi to where it says new testament 400 years elapsed during that time that one page flip because from malachi to jesus was 400 years there wasn't a prophet on on the ground until john the baptist showed up and said behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world i've come to introduce something what he come to introduce christ the literal man to the earth it's okay to say amen those of you that are awake for in him were all things created that are in heaven or earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him before who's this him jesus christ but not the body the body developed 2 000 years ago this is the son of god this is a creator that said let there be because jesus stood one day and he said before abraham was i am now that flesh didn't say that what was inside said that amen all this and he is before all things and by him all things consist now who is this guy he's the head of the body the church the bride who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence we were talking about this morning the preeminence of god means that he has first he has first choice you make him the first choice when you make any decision that's what preeminence says he is the preeminent one when you do something in your life he's thought of first anything that's why the bible says seek ye first the kingdom of god and then all these other things will come into place what if you give him the preeminence and that's what working on brother brown says that's going to be hard for us to do really is to give him the preeminences because we've been here 2000 years after he said that and we're still here that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell all right let's go to the masterpiece and just kind of jump through this real quick what we're talking about this morning and then came finally the great head the head of all of it the rest of the body just spoke of it the foundation was laid by the patriarch but the body was built by the word which was the prophets and here comes the head of it all jesus comes on the scene now why was jesus the head of all why was he the headstone why was he the capstone why was he the head of the corner why was he the rock of stumbling of rock of a fence why was he all these things you ever asked that question ask yourself that every once in a while why does it say he's all these things because he is he came here to make a church and he's the only one who could do it the right way so he's the head he's the preeminent one that we have everything flows from him to us everything flows from him to us because he's the apex of everything he's what god manifested in human flesh no more no less so the body was built by the word which was the prophets and here comes the head of it all jesus came on the scene so listen the headship of the church is who the denomination james dobson jensen franklin uh you know name them all i just remembered those is that the preeminent one is that the one that that created well yeah they caught they got this they made this church over here the pope made the catholic church and this one started this church and it started who's the preeminent one in the bible who's the only one who can save your soul who's the only one that can put these virtues inside of you and help you live them that's one man that's jesus christ that's why we have to get back to the word of god not to a denominational idea that somebody just came up with i can't take that i can't take an idea that somebody just came up with i got to be able to read it in the bible that's why i'm telling you the other day every doctrine that we are different than the world it's written right here so whose problem is it hours no bible no somebody interjected their own thought into this thing amen there's no trinity in the bible never has been never will be none listen when you have headship you don't have four husbands you don't have three husbands you don't have two husbands one husband and if jesus is our one husband then he must be god almighty in human flesh amen or then we're married to another which is very simple but the world stumbles at it we're going to read it in just a minute everything that he did the world stumbled at it's like dad always said it's kind of like you know you you've got a football field of 300 yards or 300 feet 100 yards long 50 yards wide and you got one little rock about this big and it's right out just somewhere like on the 40-yard line i mean a herd of elephants wouldn't hit it if you send them from one end to the other but the bible says he's become the stumbling stone a rock of a fence and it's going to you're going to trip over it it's like having that big old field and you just all of a sudden you're running right toward that one stone and you're going to fall right over it why they didn't understand who he was that's what my whole point is you the world does not understand the son of man the world does not understand you and i to this moment doesn't understand it 100 but we're getting there we at least have a way to get there thank god we can open up a book thank god we can listen to a message and press play whenever we want to press it but this body was built by the word and the word got so eroded down to the church ages they added the catechism they added um um this i believe this is it i believe this is it well i believe he was born in december well i believe he was the second person of the trinity well i believe he was this i don't believe he was all the way god and i believe he was part of the way god that's how these things get started folks what listen when when paul and peter lived on this earth there was not a baptist church on every corner there wasn't a methodist church on every corner there wasn't a presbyterian church on every corner there was one church but afterwards paul said grievous wolves are going to come in peter said the antichrist is going to show up and he's going to start what what is the denomination division common denominator it's a division why would you want to be divided it's not going to be a street corner for baptist and methodist and pentecostals and that don't make us different but i'm telling you we are different we are different you better expect yourself to be different you better let the world know you're different it's like martin luther stood up that day and they said oh martin luther said the world's against you he said let me tell you today he said if it had a loud speaker i believe he said let me tell the world i'm against them i don't care if the world's against me if you love the things of the world the love of the father is not in you know what the bible's saying now we have to live in the world we have to work we have to do all these things but we don't have to love being here that's our problem we get comfortable yeah oh got a good job government's giving me 12 1500 not to do nothing we drive cars that cost more than that first little trailer that i bought i'm trying to think how much it was what about six thousand dollars wasn't that much mama said it wasn't that much i had a motorcycle was worth more than that three thousand dollars mama said is that first little trailer i was telling you about that we bought so yeah it was because i remember paying it for it okay but see what we've come from we've come from that to this but have we come from starting with god in a baby form and now more mature a better house i'm not worried about that like brother john said you know you can live in a a mansion if you want to but when you pass away they're going to put you in a six-foot box and somebody else is gonna get your house right and if you don't pay your bills the irs will get it they can have it but give me the lord it's not bad to have fine things you all know that we we've never taught to not not be to not have money i want all you kids to go to school and get a good job because that's required now it's required that you get a good education to get a job and i you know if time goes on i don't want you to be paupers i want you to have a good job because that means you pay good time there's always a motive behind it sister always a motive but the body was built by the word which was the prophets and here comes the head of it all jesus comes on the scene then this head piece was put upon it i want you to understand something watch this this head piece was put upon it all right i want you to keep that thought because later on we're going to look at something because that headpiece had to fit perfect right i don't i don't have a you know don't get me wrong sister rebecca she's a pretty girl pretty lady but her head on my body ugly right so jesus didn't come with a deformed body he didn't come with a deformed head he came to put my this is my point he came to put the perfect head on a perfect body he cut that's what he come to do he come to right the wrong what happened in the garden was wrong it was hideous it was horrible horrible so he just took all that horribleness and came down here and said i'll take care of it right i'll fit the right body on the right head i'll fit the right head on the right body i'll make this thing work you just got to believe in me right he that believes in me will have life everlasting amen not me you know jesus i'm talking about him not me now again now watch now here's watch brother brown goes through all this we find in him the perfect reflection of the word for he was the word the fullness of the word now again god has the perfect masterpiece again who's he talking about it's all about the bride that's right now the perfect masterpieces on the earth they might have been missing a foot or an ankle or an arm or or something but now today this is the complete word of god this is the open book this is listen when when michelangelo walked up to that big i think it was the statue was like four feet by three feet or something the one of moses that michelangelo took do you know that to me and you that just looked like a block of granite they rolled that granite in there and set it down on the floor and michelangelo looked at it he was a master builder he looked at it and he said i can already see the image inside there it didn't develop somewhere else it always was there it was always in there it just had to come from the mind of the builder and he had to remember to knock off listen if he just went in there and started whacking away well he might have knocked the head off of it that was in that image but no he chipped away for 2 000 years he's been chipping away and now if you'll read the masterpiece brother brown said now he said it's the honing age it's not the chipping off age you're not chipping b you know used to he probably chipped off big pieces big hunks but when he got down to that detail he used a little bitty chisel and then what's the last thing you do when you have a masterpiece you polish it that's right you take you some oh you have to go to church and listen to the preacher and he just does this right here to your flesh he he just just makes you wrong sometimes but you know what when he stood back from that thing he saw what was in his mind before the foundation of the world that's what he's seeing now folks he's seeing the masterpiece again god has the perfect masterpiece not marred with put in whatever you want to ideas of man that's why i said you you see those sisters standing up here i'm gonna say it that's the perfect example of god that you can live that the perfect example of a bride without spot or wrinkle that god is going to present it he said to himself amen but we got to get there first but there had to be a beginning that had to be a time when they rolled that big stone into or set that big piece of stone in michelangelo's uh studio and i guess me and you walk by and we look at it and go what's that big old piece of rock right but what did michelangelo say he already saw the image inside there if not he would have knocked off the wrong piece at the wrong time he actually literally saw that image well you know what did god do before the foundation of the world he saw that image and he knew as a master builder he knew how to chip it away through 2 000 years of church ages he chipped away now he's come down time where he's what he's getting the eyes right he's getting the head right he's getting everything right before the detail because remember when michelangelo stood back and looked at it he saw that image and it was so real it was so real until he struck it on the knee and said speak that's what god's waiting on me and you to come to the place where you can step back and say speak cause i see myself i finally see me i don't see a world that's out here doing the things of the world i see myself i see the culmination of what i've been thinking about for six thousand years when he said let there be light you and i are the culmination of that there'll be no other bible there'll be no other church there'll be no other bride right everybody understand that this is it right this is the masterpiece perfect masterpiece again all right let's continue on let's go to psalms 85 9. i love that scripture dad read it like i said a long time ago surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him that glory may dwell in our land mercy and truth are met righteousness and peace have kissed each other in other words god and man has become one but i wanted to stop at this this morning but let's stop at it now because i want to bring something out a little bit more truth shall spring out of the earth not on the earth spring out of the earth what happens when god and man meets that's a perfect masterpiece and it's me and you that earth right there is you because when righteousness and peace kiss that's what came to being truth shall spring out of the earth and righteousness shall look down from heaven heaven is my throne god said and earth is my white footstool right statue of a perfect man spring out remember when when the sister shepherd's dream what came out of the top of that pyramid water bursting out flowing out getting out all the trash we'll get into that later on i want to get back into the statue of perfect man a little bit later on but not now everybody okay i hope this don't bore you number two god's gift always find their places and he was a being on earth a being of time which meant that he must have had a beginning therefore he created himself a body he's the only guy that can do that we can't create ourself a body to live in like i said you didn't have anything to do with you getting here nothing it was providence of god the foreknowledge of god but he could do it because he's a creator he created himself a body for himself that by this creation he might save the lost creation that he had created listen he didn't make us get lost he knew he would get lost if he put us in flesh he knew we would get lost therefore the attribute of savior could be displayed about all right look at number three how could god be created if he's a spirit how could he be he's eternal he never was created he never will be created because he was god at the beginning but he that is the beginning of the creation of god talking about revelation 3 14 was jesus christ when he was made manifest when he was made manifest in other words when he came on the earth this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell we aren't we've already been through all that we know what happened there in the river jordan and we know what happened then that when he went to uh when he went to the uh mountain and said this is my beloved son hear you him which is talking about adoption and i want to read this one quote they do not have this but i want to read this quote from adoption series 1960. i just thought about it back here says tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of god was ever to be manifested outside of this time now when were there ever was a time in history that manifests the time to deliver all nature nature the nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of manifestation talk about romans 8. why before the atonement was made before the holy ghost was ever poured out before even the old testament on down there couldn't have been manifestations it had to be this time now all things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone and we'll get to that in just a second we'll get into shape in just a second to the manifestation of sons of god coming back and the spirit of god coming into those men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close to christ to join him in the church together join him in the church together amen so we'll get to that in just a second but let's go to psalms 118 verse 21 and that's where we kind of was tailing off this morning what is a stone what is a rock in the bible the rock is a symbol as chris was talking about this past weekend which that means what revelation right you look at a rock you think strength you think well this is this is you know this ain't gonna move that rock of gibraltar has never moved in in thousands of years you know you see that big rock on what is it prudential or somewhere you see that big rock and that's what i think of when psalms 118 verse 21 says i will praise thee for that who has heard me in art my salvation the stone which the builders refused now the stone is christ right because he's the head of all revelation he is he is the stone remember he's a stone that rolled out of babylon and broke the broke the iron in the clay and all the great image in daniel the stone which the builders refused who refused him the old testament refused him the new testament refused him denominations has refused him they've refused all they've refused some of it they'll take they'll take some but they won't take all of it the stone which the builders refuse is become the headstone of the corner that brother joe was showing me um something the brother had done and i'll bring it up next sunday or sunday after on the screen where it shows that the the same headstone here is down here all right but you got your corners because he had to become listen if they rejected him here he's going to have a church without spot or wrinkle he's going to have a bride that all these characteristics virtues are going to flow through them so it doesn't matter what man does they can start 20 million denominations god's going to have a church he's going to have a bride so what he done was he they rejected him well that just cut that off he just went down to the bottom and started on the day of pentecost down at the foundation and started building back up again he's going to have a church he's going to have a bride not 10 one right that's what i asked it i shouldn't have done it there's a new little baptist preacher there in town we were talking about something chris said something about something i said i said well let me ask you a question i said you're baptist he said yeah i said why don't you go to a methodist church he just kind of looked at me he said because i'm a baptist i said well what's the difference in you and the methodists i thought y'all all believed jesus christ was the son of god i thought you all believed in no we don't believe like they believe i said so you're telling me that they're all going to hell and you're going to heaven well now i ain't exactly saying that i said well wait a minute you're saying they're wrong and you're right of course i let him go i got him off of that because he's a good kid i let him off i didn't say any more about it but he had that deer in the headlight look i said well why are you believing this doctrine and you're believing it's this way because you don't believe this one and then y'all all going to go to heaven and what's going to happen we're going to have divisions in heaven i don't think so we're going to have one city we're going to have one earth there's going to be many heavens read your bible heavens and one earth there's not going to be a hundred earths you're gonna be one earth why because that's where you came from that's why he thought so much of you he put you in this earth right what a mighty god we serve ephesians two verse 19 says now therefore you are no more strangers than foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets you believe in prophets yeah so do i jesus christ though being the chief cornerstone chief cornerstone start the building if you start the building right right you know brother gary built some pretty houses i've seen him build several things myself personally we started with a good foundation though i don't care how the building looks you put it on a shabby foundation it will fall it will crack i don't care how big you build it it will fall over look at the leaning tower pizza pizza not pizza what it was not built on a good foundation but you and i that's why the zerubbabel that's why you had all the different ones where you had to clean the foundation off because look the foundation was jesus christ so he didn't have to be remade you just had to clean that part off and start building the right building all right so let's look here in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple of the lord that's where we're at this morning and where is that holy temple it's you and me start the building right right if you start right you'll end right amen and of all the buildings fitly framed together growth into a holy temple in the lord in whom ye also are building together for a habitation not just building the building to look at it he's not just wanting to look at you today he's wanting to dwell inside of you he's wanting to inhabit your building that's what it says right here in whom you also are building together for inhabitation of god through the spirit amen all right let's start here with first peter to go to second peter and then we'll get to something skip a little bit of this oh i didn't read this quote a minute ago i'll read it in a minute ye also as lively stones some of you right now are not very lively harrison he's good he also has lively stones or built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices how are you going to do it if you don't know the word of god you got to be taught right acceptable to god by jesus christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i land zion a chief cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be what confounded confusion that's what the world loves but listen we should not be confused folks listen we should not be confused we might not understand some things but to be confused means not knowing where you're going or where you came from now well you better know where you come from and where you're going at least you should know that shall not be confounded promise put this in the bible this is my promise he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed in other words they did away with a headstone the same has made the head of the corner in other words he is still by all these scriptures he is going down to the foundation and he is going to build a church it's not going to be off level it's going to be exactly perfectly level right and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them with stumble what at the word raise that up a little bit if you don't mind so we can all read it there what stumble at the word being disobedient what knowing when the bible tells you what to do and you don't do it that's disobedience amen being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed there are some people going to be appointed to that they're just going to manifest that and sorry they just chose it that way everybody all right skip a little bit of this and we'll get down to where we're at that's all right we'll not be too long let me read this quote i missed it a few minutes ago it's in the horizon of the sun brother i'm saying i'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting people to christ we're getting them to a church or to a theory a theory but we must get them to christ he is the only one the only one that has life he that has the son has life and if the life of a man that's dead be projected in you you will live the same life he lived you will live the same life he lived i wrote myself a note and i go back to yeah he's got it up there okay now look we must to stay and not be confounded and to be able to do the right thing we must go step by step through the word of god and let somebody teach us and we've had a good teacher still have a good teacher no excuse there then mark that one off if you have an excuse that's not one of them mark that went off i slept in church while he was teaching keep that one because you don't need to mark that one off but look we're getting people are we getting people to christ and that's what i'm telling you the son of man that's who christ is christ is the son of man listen normal revelation of the world will not get you anywhere normal revelation of the world will get you nowhere amen now look but this revelation will get you somewhere because listen to me let's go to second peter one we'll skip a bunch of that uh go down to second peter one guys i know i skipped about three pages but i don't want to i want to be too long i want to get something no just keep on going way on down second peter one verse three is right after first peter two verse five which is almost at the very end there you go according as his divine now this is second peter this is peter the naked fisherman that can't write his name i wonder who wrote that for him can't write his name ignorant unlearned it's what the bible said i'm talking about bible peter was naked on the boat fishing and you know they're pretty rough fishermen have a pretty yeah they're rough so what better a man they got turned around on their pentecost by the word of god that wanted to that wanted to fight physically and cut people's ears off and stab them and shoot them and whatever lord will not let you go he said peter before the crows this morning in other words before the morning before the sun comes up you're going to deny me three times three times you're gonna deny you even knew who i was and i bet peter inside was like yeah yeah right i'll cut another ear off if i can but buddy when they hauled him off the pilot's hall where'd he go he you can see him over there in the corner around the fire you know kind of hunkered down and that you know this man nope don't know him you know this man i know you talk just like nope don't know him and in the third person he got a little righteous indignation he didn't have a whole lot of tempers or patience at that moment because he started cursing i don't know this person but listen when he got born again amen he wrote this according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding i'll read this whole chapter there's all kind of i guess is that adjectives you know is that that'd be exceeding precious and all these all these things that is adjectives that describe something way above what it's supposed to be whereby are given unto us exceeding not just great it could have read like this whereby are given unto us great promises that don't sound very good i mean it sounds okay but when you say whereby are giving us exceeding great and precious promises that by these promises in other words you might be partakers partakers not lookers not window dressers but partakers of the divine nature of god divine nature that's why you must have the new birth before you can get these virtues you do not know how to get them you do not know what they are you might be protectors of the divine nature having what escape the corruption that is in the world through lust now look that was a wonderful dissertation peter is setting you up he's saying divine power according to divine power has given unto who us all things pertain to life and governments through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory in virtue he's talking about us all right whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust all right okay peter said oh wait a minute and besides this and besides what i just told you you got to get the new birth you got to get the you got to get the uh the divine nature of god and beside this giving all there's another one giving all diligence add to your faith your new birth virtue and to your virtue add knowledge and the knowledge add temperance into temperance add patience i believe when peter was writing this there was probably some tears running out of his eyes he's going man i used to not have any of them and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity he didn't finish there watch scroll up for if these things these virtues be in you and look there's an abound heaping over full saucers running over they make you that will make you jesus christ if you'll let it right oh i can't be yeah you can because the perfect one's inside you be there for perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect so wait a minute wait a minute hold on so where'd jesus get all these virtues out from the father the creator the one that never sinned the one that never had a problem one that never did any of those things wrong the divine nature of god was in jesus christ not another person same person but like i said this morning he let him develop out through his flesh so that he can display him so that we can read matthew mark luke and john and get this whole statue of a perfect man in just four four matthew martin luke and john that's the divine nature of god is that okay can you say amen then okay they make you that you shall neither be what barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ listen that's why these virtues are a requirement in this age who wants to be barren who wants to be unfruitful i thought we were lively stones but look but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see or understand afar off and look and hath forgotten has forgotten that he was purged from his old sin wow wherefore the rather brethren give there's that word again diligence to make your calling in election sure for if you do these things what a promise look at that you shall never fall did jesus fall no if you take that divine nature and you put it in you guess what you're not gonna fall either oh you're gonna have problems but you're not gonna fall you know why because you're a mature christian you know how to handle things you don't let little things bother you anymore just saying remember some of this but if you'll grow you'll never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom look an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly look at this whole scripture whole i mean he used some wonderful adjectives we hear a lot of bad ones out in the world so we can get some good ones here if you don't mind abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore look i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things what these things that's why we preach in this church actively preach the status of a perfect man over and over again i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things what these virtues though you know them and be established in the present day truth present day truth today is the present day truth now i'm not going to get into the verses but i want to read something i'll show you a little something i believe it'll help us because remember the head and the body spiritually has been separated everybody okay with that the body came back on the day of pentecost and it's been building the body the head's here the head's jesus christ in the seventh dimension with a glorified body the son of man everybody okay all right so it's not complete yet but there's got to come a time where it's got to be back together again everybody got that amen that's our commission colossians 1 verse 18 says he is the head of the body we read it i'm going to read it again the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence if you let these virtues work in your life you will have the preeminence i believe please the father that in him should all fullness dwell now i was looking the other day and i know brother branham he brings us a in the statue of perfect man he starts talking about um certain things about the shape of pyramids and we know what a pyramid is it's just like that that's a pyramid right and it's three-sided right not four-sided it's three-sided that right try all right now watch let's read this last quote then questions and answers 1964. the question was are you the son of man i didn't put that on there because he brings a bunch before that it's not pertinent to what i wanted you to see so i cut it short for time because he said i am not he they said brother adam are you the son of man he says no definitely not i was born in sin in other words the son of the son of man was not so i am not he i am his servant and the pillar of fire is not he and morphy we know it is but it's not what he's talking about it's in spirit form see which was upon the son of man remember on the river jordan there was an anointing came on jesus and then brother brown said in the garden of gethsemane that anointing left him the ministry left him so he could die is that right it's in spirit form which was upon the son of man and has come now to anoint sons of men to bring back what a ministry just exactly like he said it would be look in order for the head and the rest of the body watch to connect together listen if you take this cap that i've got in my hand you can't see it but you really can't see it now if i take and put this right here on there like that what happened what happened slides off gets knocked off if it's just completely straight across but if some way you can get it to stay let's pay attention for just a second everybody wake up this will be it right here we'll be done this is just something i want you to chew on but watch connect together there's no good for the head to be here in the body to be here there's got to be a connection there's got to be an invisible union there's got to be bride and bridegroom connecting all right so that what so that when you he moves you move all right everybody all right now watch just like the pyramid as enoch built and we find that in that pyramid they never did get the headstone on it why the headstones yet to come in other words all the pyramids in egypt have a flat piece just like this on it this is not on the pyramid in egypt go look at it it doesn't ever come to a point it's got a flat piece on top showing enough showing in the behind the bible of that time remember brother brown said that was what the second bible the headstones yet to come the seven steps in the pyramid we'll go through that someday i'd just like to show you how it really is perfectly with the scripture and now if you notice on your american dollar bill if you got a dollar bill you can look at it turn it over on the back that great headstone and i says the great seal it will come and notice these stones was anybody ever here at the pyramids in egypt well if you notice then there's hands that went up that had been there all right these stones are laying in there so perfect that and that top where the coppola like in the top what's a coppola it's like a cap where the coppola locking the top of it look when that stone comes what's this it'll be like a great diamond fitting right down in everybody got that now what's the shape of a diamond that's not the shape of a diamond that's a diamond that's the way it's going to fit it's going to go down in can't move can't slide watch when that stone comes it'll be like a great diamond fitting right down in there just perfect with it now that stone would not fit down at the bottom foundation that stone feel like that's not going to fit on the bottom right that's what he's saying apart watch neither will it fit on the second foundation or the third it'll only fit on the top when the entire building has become fitted to that stone bridegroom bride fit in he comes down in and you can't shake it off brother brown talks of a flange in the statue of a perfect man to shed water the bride and bridegroom uniting uniting together consummating the marriage he's the head of it all right and he's wanting to not be with us not be beside us he wants to be in us because if he's not inside of us he can't work now watch it'll only fit on the top foundation when the entire building has become fitted to the stone and jesus cannot come until the church a body of believers and the ministry that he wants will have to be the same listen as it was then and that brings them without us is not made perfect paul said hebrews 11 without us they cannot be perfected they must have this ministry to raise up the lutherans westlands and all them down through the ages a ministry a diamond and you read brother brown talks about a diamond many many many times how it reflects light and it's got all these different colors but if you look he didn't say pyramid shape he said diamond diamond shape now that's not on it's not on here and he didn't draw it i'm just telling you that's what i see because we must unite not just sit on top we must unite and be together amen a union a spiritual union an invisible union nobody's gonna know this the world's not they're going to look at us cross-eyed they do anyway when your sisters walk down the street you go what do you mean you don't wear pants why is your hair so long boy you know what how many times my somebody told my wife not too long ago there was a guy saw her that we know roger corn he's been here before he said i just love to see godly women you know with long hair and address he said i love to see godly women you know i tell you look at what the world tells us the world tells us we should look at somebody that's all painted up and made up whatever happened to natural beauty those three girls natural beauty godly beauty something i'm not ashamed of but now they some that i've seen i'd be ashamed of all tatted up and got earrings and those rings and eye rings and tongue rings and but you see how the world's i'm sorry you see how the world sees that though that's common that's normal that's okay no it's not the bible tells you not to ink your body not punch holes all in yourself just go in there okay sorry but we've got to be different you cannot make yourself different god has to make you different i mean when we were growing up going to school now joyce is not included in that because she's a lot older right then yeah you're not saying a word are you he's not he just look he's not saying nothing i'm not gonna say anything but we had sister we had girls in the church that they go to school and they'd have their britches pants in their locker room and they'd put them on when they got to school because they didn't want to get talked about now joyce fountain i've been with her ever since we've been kids and that's not happened with her but it has happened that's not right folks that's living a lie but you know what you get born again that's why we teaching you birth the way we do you get born again a born-again believer won't do that we'll never do that because you know what you're contrary to the bible you're not contrary to what this man said on a tape or what this man said 50 years ago or what the man said today behind the pulpit it's what the bible says modesty not be connected to the world we listen we're connected enough to the world amen enough to where i'm about sick of it if you don't get sick of it you've got a problem sick and tired of being sick and tired but you're not gonna see that when you get to heaven you're not gonna see tatted up people and screws in their nose and all that other stuff no you're not going to see that if listen if you see it here you're going to see it there because what you are here is exactly what you're going to be there and there if that's not included in there you're not going to be the there that we're talking about you're going to be in another there which is the reasons of the lost not trying to scare you but i'm telling you the son of man came to live what the bible said he lived it to a t now that same person came down through the church ages and look he winked at the ignorance of man well you know he did because luther was a trinitarian yet he saved him okay but it wasn't time it wasn't time for the head and the body to meet it was time to building the body but not a time to put the top on it to make a complete unit you come into our age you've got almost built to the very top and then you've got a head that's got to unite with it and when they're hitting the body unite brother brown said then that's when we're going to go in a rapture let's stand our feet you're going to go in the rapture when the head and body unites and the same ministry see you can't have the same ministry in 12 or 13 000 different ways of seeing jesus christ there's only one right and he's not going to accept anything different but all that live godly in christ shall what suffer persecution don't think it's going to be a piece of cake it's not but y'all the prettiest girls and boys i'm not boys they're not pretty they're handsome some of the handsomest prettiest people that i've ever seen is our as our young adults amen [Applause] and if you're doing it just because your parents told you to do it you're doing it wrong all right you need to do it for god you need to do it for the lord you know what james always told her her parents said why do you not why do you do the things why you just look so you know you look so um was plain looked plain so okay that's all right plane's good to me you know what i can wake up and look at the same woman i look at at four o'clock in the afternoon the world can't say that you know what i mean okay so to me that's plain and that's fine but she said if if jesus christ can hang on a cross for three hours with nails in his hands beat like hamburger meat crown of thorns pushed on his head a spear in his side beat with stripes on his back i can deal with this long hair because god said it was your glory and if you cut it it's an abomination to god amen i'm just telling you what the bible
