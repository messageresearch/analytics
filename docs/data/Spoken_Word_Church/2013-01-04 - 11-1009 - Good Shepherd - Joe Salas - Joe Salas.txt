========================================

this week they're still in celebrating that anniversary so I hope they saw the mystery on the missing hundred dollar bill I don't know today I want to continue my son and I was working on last time on uh dog door and a door but I'm in the keys along uh but mostly I want to go in the I'm a Good Shepherd today so I'm gonna speak a little bit on my door and then I'm gonna build a good shepherd so we're going to read psalms 23. I preacher usually use this on uh like a funeral so we're gonna we're gonna use this so we can take that what we're talking about the Good Shepherd the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want you make me to lie down and bring pastures he leaded me beside the Still Waters he restores my soul he needed me in a path I watched his nest for his name's sake he although I walked with a belly in the shadow of a death I will fear no evil but thou art with me thy right and thy staff comfort me thou prepares the table before man president of my enemies the anointed my head with oil My Cup right over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days I'm alive and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever David was a David was a shepherd and God made him a king there's a lot of like Moses he was a shepherd He addressed that people under Egypt he says that our fear no evil for thou are with me why greater to see that see me that he is in the world foreign Greek artists I just can't think of the man's name at that time but he had spent practically a lifetime painting this picture and you see before it can be hung and the Hall of Fame has to go through the Hall of critics first any picture you must do that he must space the critters now this picture as the artist painted when he went to the hall about critics they could find nothing wrong and finally a great credit came up and said there's one thing wrong with your picture he said it's true Jesus with a lantern is hand coming by night and the Darkness of sin you say that's good his expression with the expectation of somebody to come to the door when he's knocking you say that's wonderful and looked up upon his spirit and he's longing to hear from the inside but he says sir there is no latch on the door if he become how could Jesus get in because there's no latch on the door oh said the artist that I painted those for the last on the inside Jesus cannot come in just by his will it's got to be your your will to let him in he said Lord stand at the door knock and marry him in or here my voice and come in let me in I will come in I will stop with him of course just remember can you hear me but who is any greater than Jesus and he is turned away from more doors and all the dictators and kings and politics of the world say yes I am I stand at the door and knock If any man will hear my voice and open the door I will come and I will serve with him he said his little knocks that we get at the door many times Jesus knocks it a heart store that's where the church is today those little knocks you feel it no doubt right now what is it is Jesus trying to come in gain answers to your heart the door he just wants to talk to you a little while I just just don't want to Jesus don't want that he wants to give you something that's the reason not he's got something for you there's nothing that could be greater than what is going to give you the holy spirit is wanting to give you eternal life he said as we look and see the cause of judgment forming to hear science set is three minutes till midnight and praying to those minutes are gone that was several years ago so where are we now he said we must welcome him Lord will come into my house if there's anything if there's anything in here that you want help yourself he said I'm yours you're mine you honor me the great king the Cradle of heavens and earth that's not at my door I want you to come in Lord be my Lord pick me may you do me anything you want to any bad thing that's in me discover every secret that's in my heart go in every door search me out Lord see what's wrong with me and whatever is wrong show me Lord throw it out the door I want you in here I welcome you and to be my Lord God I haven't got that blessing Lord bring me now making my Lord I'll never open the door to him if he can't be my Lord I just don't want him to be my savior if he can reward because everybody wants to see them but they don't want to lower they want something that they can escape all the damnation of health and then they can live any way they want to or they want to you know let's just walk around the village or the heart will be stand with me another 10 minutes let's walk around the heart just a minute the first thing is going to human heart on the right side as you go in as a little bit older there it's called my private life now you don't want nobody fooling in that not if you want to do anything that's my business I'll join the church I'll go down there but preacher don't you tell me what I got to do now I know the Bible says that but I don't believe it oh Lord see now you think Jesus will ever stay in a heart like that certainly not it counts him to be Lord and that the private life oh that's a great thing now you know we want I want private life so do we want a social drink with a neighborhood that's our business if we're a woman who want to cut our hair that's what that's our American American privilege you want to wear shorts that's our business well that's true if we want to take a social drink and we want to let our wife do that you ain't got no business saying one word to us but the gospel says don't do it now whose word is right you see God's word is right say oh sure we want and we want Jesus turned it we think we got him all like that but if I wander if that Rapture could pass and we we left alone one day then one or whatever it's all that come by real but real secretly you know and that's what it's coming like a thief in the night 99 out of every half a million every million will never know the Rapture takes place you'll be gone and they won't even know nothing about it Jesus said so so that makes it right seed certainly put calm like a thief in the night now I want to go on a message why it had to be Shepherds uh because remember kind of like a Christmas message he talks about when Jesus was born and stable and why it had to be Shepherds goes up and all the civilizers whatever we don't accept them that way on the bottom of the Schofield Bible Matthew 18 10. if you haven't talked about it after 1810 . that's chapter 10 I'm sorry chapter 10 at the bottom I don't know you'll notice you said that Shepherd or Governor has three aspects as a good shepherd he said he gave his life for the Sheep John 10. 11. he's there for the door by which If any man Enter he shall be saved this answer Psalm 22 he is the great Shepherd brought again from the dead Hebrews 13 20 to care for and make perfect sheep he's a sheep Shepherd who is coming in the glory to give cross a reward to the faithful Shepherd okay Jesus said bye all you have given me I have lost none brother man said he said she keeps getting out if the shepherd loves his sheep he will bring one of his legs so he don't get out anymore that's my God if we go astray he might have to put and they put him to put us into desperation and come back to God in the message why it had to be Shepherd girlfriend said I wonder if you've ever had the privilege of talking with a Shepherd or being with one and well if you would uh don't like to say it because of my remark I'm fixing to say that the world but but the shepherd stage with the Sheep so much that until he even laughs like the Sheep he talks like the sheep and smells like the Sheep that's right because he's been a sheep that's all he knows it's a sheep now the medicated word of the truth when these Shepherds humble uneducated men what an honor I feel like it is to the shepherd to receive the message of a newborn sheep you come to nothing else but a Shepherd that's why he was born in a stable and night and a house sheep are not born in the house but I think decorated hospitals see they're born and they're born in the fields there's a reason he was there to cover it you cannot make the Sheep walk the gangway to the slaughter did you know all that in the slaughter yards they had to go it needs the sheep and when he gets up to where the killing place is he jumps out and lets the Sheep go on the cheek has to be led he can't lead himself so therefore it had to be Shepherd coming for their sushi when they found that God they extracted me for their messenger said he would be and when they found this message the message or the measure and the major exactly where the angel said it would be you know the herdsman that Jesus chose when he was here in order to hurt his sheep love those meet Peter more than these yes Lord go live feed my sheep and the Bible said the fear was an ignorant and learned man still choosing Shepherds but the Shepherds fell completely and he's in that place with God's lamb any good trip or does the same thing when a Good Shepherd told his sheep can see the word of God made plan and Vindicated what he promised to do this Shepherd's right at home I don't care what anybody else says there's God's promised in it and he did it he said through all the scriptures your adventure has been represented through Shepherds and sheep that's right he all agreed to that point it was the Shadows you can shadow in a tight and anything I never had seen my hand and I looked down here in my handshadowed and I see I had five fingers I would know that it was reflecting the negative it was reflecting and positive and that's why the message always come to Redemption by sheep because from the very beginning it was sushi and by Shepherd there he revealed himself all was shadows and kite he said now let us look at the beginning Adam and Eve standing there in the presence of God to hear his message to them they had read about along the skin a sheep the first message was ever heard was given over the top of the Dead Chef's King cheap skin and got his slew and wrecked Adam and Eve and had after they tried to make their own religion out of siblings it wouldn't work she sacrificed had been instituted for atonement since the very beginning he said now the prophets the Old Testament great themselves in sheepskin we know that signifying that faith in his word with the common coming perfect land he said now we're going to find a way to come to Shepherd than either sheepy is helpless with either Shepherd too to guide them the Sheep is perfectly helpless he cannot go by himself that's the reason God liking his believing children unto sheep they got it to be guided I watched what's going on don't get to go we'll walk you to the slaughter dance his son the holy spirit that guide us he is our guide not some man made first man by god-given first man who treat the Sheep upon food okay God was training Moses to be a to be a Shepherd to bring his people out of Egypt but everyone said that he asked Moses uh Moses where are you going he said I'm going to I'm going to over Egypt to take over with a stick in his hand so he picked up his uh wife Sephora and Milo and his sons and went over to Egypt to take over now what they did he do by The Shepherd's death not a textbook not a theology she always idea of a shepherd's death we're coming to it in a minute at Shepherd's dead he did it not a denomination prayer book by Shepherd's dead Shepherds arrived died and his sheep making the way clear as they went towards that promised a word in the land he said what a beautiful thing that is today that Shepherd's day of the day guiding his cheek to the promised man bypassing all the Theology and everything else of this world and the things of the world and the denomination of everything opening up the way and providing his work to be the truth the shepherd's death going ahead and order the same Shepherd's death that was guiding the Sheep do you believe that he's certainly didn't guide the Sheep he delivered them out of Egypt with that staff and his hand you could say more about it but to hit the highlight he said he got his sheep and send judgment upon the rejection of the Saints death that he came at blessing to one became a curse to the others the same Waters I know Noah's preaching to save him condemned the world the same stuff that let Israel to the promised land from Land gosh who refused to follow the prophet Shepherd that's right to come and stick a judgment not to all that all As We Know Israel did not receive the prophet Shepherd's word Allah Israel did not receive it I noticed he was complaining oh honey it was perfect and the Miracles he was a great fellow but when it came to this message that was different all great science follow a new message coming we know that in the wilderness there's complain in the wilderness they die by the thousands frankly there was only two of them that ever went to that was saved out of a two and a half million two out of two and a half million that's a lot saying God that Moses broke up come over Moses and proved by Phil apart that he was Jehovah that was maybe most of the God was in his Shepherd prophet that secret that she could have been in God's delusion all these years covered by his right hand Jesus said the great Shepherd took up himself out of guilt for us Isaiah 53 6 said he was wounded for our transgressions he would lose for our iniquities the chastisements that our peace was upon him with his stripes we are healed The Secret of God's healing made in the Muslim like Jesus of God he was on the right hand of God that's the only sheep that held that's the only sheep that held and he's losing the secret that's the reason that four Shadows of it that could always be a sheep the first was the Sheep the last was a sheep that's the reason I had to come to a Shepherd to know how to take care of his sheep you get it notice he was wounded for our transgressions Bruce for our iniquities the chastise mess of our peace upon him said my great Shepherd was smitten the great Shepherd Prophet when he was being smitten back there and said it is finished and that minute as soon as the shepherd was then it was over sin and settled there was no more sin they were clean the penalty was paid he Believers whose names were written in the Book of Life predestinated from their foundation of the world it was finished the very minute that Jesus said it was finished you that great Shepherd had come for his sheep it was Spanish that right hand was pulled from his version of spirit Now Easter he returned raise it up again to the bosom and extended to the down to you and I in the fallen on his work to redeem us back to the original Garden from which Saint took us from the hidden secret that his great heart was revealed by a prophet Shepherd he was revealed revealed by Shepherd Prophet Shepherd same men and women God promised in the last days that he for our spirit upon affairs he probably saying that baptism of the Holy Ghost and you call it right without spot a wrinkle he promised to do it he'll do it don't listen to the darling Shepherd they'll need you astray the Holy Spirit and Shepherd to teach you she conclude from his word he had always come by the shepherd He Is Our Shepherd listen to him you are the Sheep of his bowl in the order you're here his voice not what somebody else says you hear what he says as transposed you know nothing about well Moses uh take the people that are easy they recall that people have got and until they came out then they will call the Church of God it means they called out ones that was a Shepherd too and he has a mixed multitude and um believe and make believe it's unbelievable just like Moses did he had a next multitude and only only two made it out of the million or whatever they say we have to make sure we receive enough next time I'll try to bring something new what were you reading out of there what brother Brandon would have been reading that on there the last one um
