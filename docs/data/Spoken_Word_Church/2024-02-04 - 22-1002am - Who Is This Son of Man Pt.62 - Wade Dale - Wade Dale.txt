was good both services and the Sunday go and everything was done um brother Aaron picking up with the song service and we sure appreciate it we appreciate everything that everybody does there's no way you can um as I've always said with um when we always get together at Christmas you know the greatest Christmas gift we could give brother Dale is that we live what he preaches right that's a greatest gift you can give him everything in the world you can give him 10 cars and he can drive them and they'll just get old but one Soul saved we were talking about that last night in the Bible study one one man preaching the gospel here look where all brother dick and all the different ones came from dville way down there in Atlanta lived all in these different places and then here they start migrating brother Tom then brother Tom goes one day and starts working out in a gym and there was Gary Atkins and he presented the message to Brother Gary Atkins and then Brother Gary Atkins come to the message so you see how God is doing his mult multiplying himself this is way it was supposed to be had it not been a fall this one I this what I believe we would all come all right the bride would come in its own in their own time but you know what we've come in our own time now man so there's really nothing different we haven't upset the plan of God the plan of God is exactly the way it's supposed to be amen so thank you for all your prayers and and the uh I was telling brother Bob I'll give you just a minute for Testimony before we get in I got a pretty long list to to uh uh for announcements but there's a sister up there in Ohio and she may be watching in today which is fine her name's Anna and she's in the service and um I noticed Sunday you know I told Bob I said sometimes

which is what Redemption and this girl's just I mean she's just boooo she took communion for the first time she told Jim she said would you she said I don't know what I'm doing said Jim said I'll help you I'll help you through this Isaac he called me yesterday he said she's went and tried to find she's starting to find some dresses for her to wear thank you Lord she's under conviction of the things that she did that's the way a sinner comes that's the way somebody comes to God I couldn't remember her name I just called her sister Alabama that's all I remember but her name's Anna now but just pray for her amen just pray for her she's she's the the family that she's got a good and she's a a boyfriend of of Isaac's son brother Gabriel she's a girlfriend of his and um that she's just a sweetheart just just really a nice person and and and we're going to pray that God will help her through all this amen and being in the military you know you may have to do certain things like you may have to wear you know slacks or something during your army time but we're going to pray that God will make the he'll just put all that together listen if there's a desire in your heart God will give you a person in the pull pit he will give you a desire to come to church he'll give you a desire to be saved cuz we can't save anybody amen we can just preach the word but just preaching the word of

Freddy he's in ICU so let's remember brother Freddy this in ICU boy we had a good Bible Study last night good Bible Study last night had a good time in the Lord had a lot of people had 11 people on zoom and had a bunch of people sitting there and I appreciate all of you coming I appreciate some of you that fixed things and and brought things but we're going to we're going to also starting next year we're not going to have Bible study in November the 5th cuz that'll be the night before the wedding and we need to let that be where we can get everything ready for the wedding so we won't have it November may have it in December you know how rough December is also but starting January we're going to have in January we're going to have youth service the third Saturday of January as far as I know now brother Daryl Ward's going to be with us on that service all right then and the then we won't have Bible study we usually don't in January anyway cuz it falls on the first of the year but we're going to have Bible study on on the other odd months the like February at the third Saturday not the first so we're going to change this around and we'll be letting you know a little bit later on but we decided that last night so now take your calendar my my whole point is take your calendar and put a circle around the third Saturday of every month one month is going to be the youth the next month it'll be Bible study so just write that down in your put it in your calendar I still use one of those I have one in my phone I have my little notes but I do have a calendar brother John I walk by and I see that X and I'm like what or that star it reminds me to go to the doctor or it reminds me to have Bible study so just remember that and keep that in your prayer also um yes I got every bit of that also I want to um I want to um I some of you know that that uh when that I had created a list of people that uh and I called their names over the pulpit and it it by no means was I want to hurt anybody's feelings or call anybody out by no means CU God knows my heart but it did upset some people and it did cause a little stir I don't want that God knows I don't want that I want people saved and I believe the Lord had me write that list but I in my misinterpretation should have kept it in my Bible and prayed for them by myself that's where I missed it and I apologize that I missed that part of the discernment that I was I was zealous and I'm sorry I'd rather be zealous than asleep but in being zealous I do not want to hurt people's feelings and I apologize and if you see anybody that you know that that was here that day or that I call their name I apologize from the bottom of my heart no way in the world would I want anybody to not come to church all right everybody with me on that all right and I I I I looked up today and brother brandham did the same thing one time he did the same identical thing he said but he said I don't want to do that anymore he said it hurt to many people's feelings well some people I know I know that but listen I apologize for what I did I want you to forgive me forgive me for what I did all right that was not appropriate at the time in the moment it's not inappropriate to pray for people but it it would be inappropriate I guess to call somebody out I I was looking at a quote back here where brother Brown called a girl out one time and she missed her she missed her whole eternal life by being angry at brother brandom so don't be angry at me love me and forgive me of what I did cuz I do feel now that looking back on it that that uh that it was inappropriate to do at the time and I do apologize for that amen everybody all right with that let's move forward let's keep going we're going to keep we got battles we're on a battleship not a cruise ship right we got battles to fight we got to learn how to fight all right that's what we're doing here with the Statue of perfect man so let's turn our Bibles to um to John 1 1 this will be part 62 I want to bring out a few things extra that we didn't Wednesday night and then this afternoon uh I stumbled on something that we really really need to look at uh according to the statute of perfect man listen as we were talking about last night brother Dale brought the brought the porn out last night how many you enjoyed brother Dale last night bringing it out all right so thank God for that I appreciate that and and and you know we cherish that and he was saying about justification sanctification he said there's some it will come to justification it won't come to sanctification that some will come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost some won't come to the baptism of Holy Ghost some will come to the Statue of perfect man some won't but it's not for us to pick who they are it's for us to preach the gospel throw the net out there and whatever you get you going to drag some fish in and because we need to go to the Lost we need the lost in cuz I'm telling you the door is fixing to be shut at least I know one thing for sure thus sayith the Lord we're one day closer to the Rapture than we were yesterday right we're we're one month closer September 2022 is gone we're one month closer to the coming of the Lord and I want to be ready don't you I don't want to keep Leave Nobody behind I want to be ready all right so let's bow our heads Lord thank you for all the time that you give us with our brothers and sisters and I pray now that you'd sanctify us Lord for this journey forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make Lord you know in our heart that we want everybody to make it we don't want anybody to miss out we want we want this church full of people that with the Holy Ghost that that you can work through them and speak through them even in speaking in tongues and even even worshiping and even being song leaders and being deacons and being elders and being ministers we want Lord each one to be a part of the body of Christ and father we pray Lord that you just give us this day our daily bread forgive us of our sins bless the ones that are sick bless the here that sister Angie Brown called in about the brother Freddy that you would he and I see you we don't know what's wrong with him doesn't matter doesn't matter about distance we know one thing for sure you can go there in a split second and touch our brother Lord just touch us and lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus name we pray Amen in the beginning was the word word was with God and Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth first Thessalonians say says that every one of you should know that's what we're doing we're learning we're learning to know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor Romans 12:2 says and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God and what is the will of God his word you may be seated in the Lord as his Blessing to the reading of the word and we look and we see that we we were talking about last night and only in the son of man Ministry Judas was sitting right there beside Jesus they said Jesus who is the one's going to betray me or betray you he said the one that stops in the bowl well there was Judas with his bread sopping in the bowl and they're still going is it me is it me is it me you see how deceived they were amen you see how deceived they were but now who was not deceived the son of man was not deceived he knew knew who that was by spiritual discernment he knew that Judas was going to do what he was going to do all right so now I understand and know that if we talk about anointed ones at the end time and this thing's going to be so close until it's a Razor's Edge in between it only that there's going to be as we're talking about a few minutes there's going to be a showdown there's going to be a showdown there is going to be a time at separat because Judas looked at Jesus and What Judas what did Jesus say he said go do what you need to do and he went out that was judas's problem he left he left the presence of God what was Cain's problem back in the Garden of Eden well he didn't have a problem while he was in the garden cuz God said hey if you'll do like your brother said I'll say in other words I'll save you that was a question last night and and you know you hear people in the message preaching lineages and how that this is a serpent seed line and you can't do come on people good grief Satan even had a choice amen right he was made perfect he was made the anointed cherub he was made the right hand man of God until iniquity was found in his heart he made a choice Cain made a choice to go in another Direction It's All by choice folks my brother Lis did a wonderful job Sunday bringing it down but you know what there's a lot of people that don't that don't like that because they want to think that they were just this always was an eagle and I'm always sent in church and I'm always this and it makes brother ter said it makes them lazy it makes it where you just say okay I got it boy I just felt something right here well you know what Judas when he was preaching the gospel remember Jesus gave him power to preach the gospel cast out Devils that's why I said that somebody was talking about Judas last night the Bible says that Satan entered into the heart of Judas we read it we're going to read it in communion right Simon son to to betray him it entered in and you know brother R will say well he was the son of predition he wasn't the son of predition he was the son of Judas as whoever his mom and daddy was but when he accepted Satan's life when he accepted Satan why because here's my point the Bible Jesus looked at the people and says look bless you do that in about 40 minutes somebody my might wake up but here's Jesus and he he looks at the people and he says you call me bsub he said but Satan can't cast out Satan so if Judas was Satan he couldn't be casting out Devils when God told him but no he could cast out Devils because God give him an opportunity he gave him three and a half years to make it right and finally he had to come to a showdown in the upper room he said Judas go do what you need to do Satan entered his heart he went and did what he did and then remember the prophet of go God said if he' have made it to Pentecost he could have been saved he just he stopped that's our problem we shouldn't stop we need to keep going to what the Holy Ghost he was justified he was Sanctified but he was not filled with the Holy Ghost all right he would just but you say well this line no it wasn't this lineage right it was the for knowledge of God knowing what Judas would do when he got here that's so simple it goes over people's mind and they go like well that was it I'm stamped you know I'm I'm going to make it I'm predestinated listen everybody is predestinated every person is even Satan is predestinated don't you think God made him knowing what he would do but he made him to make a choice and when he made that choice he could be a Healer a savior a redeemer and all these different attributes that God could display because Satan made a choice listen God made a choice he chose me and you to be his bride so he made a choice he didn't have to listen he doesn't need us to exist but he wants us here to exist with him to come down into what into life into time get born again makes your soul Eternal not the rest of you and then you go what you go back to where you came from very simple in continuous we're we're being born as I was telling them last night night as the preacher the other day was talking and he said you know what he said I know you're lost and I know you're a sinner for one thing you got a belly button you were tied to a woman you know what brother R said the problem was we were born by a woman if we're born by a man we'll live so that Genesis 126 man that I love so much that theophany of God it don't have a belly button cuz it was not tied to a woman it's tied to God it's tied to the eternal ET and that's what comes to you a new birth listen if that was already in you Jesus didn't have to die what did the Holy Ghost come for that's right it's kind of simple but you know what one word off folks you say boy sometimes y'all are a little bit uh dogmatic that's all right with me they call Jesus everything in the world but God maybe we ought to try that sometime be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that that's what we got to work on cuz listen in your soul you have the mind of Christ today in your soul you are born again in your soul you're Eternal Paul says sitting in Heavenly places in Christ try that on Monday yeah get up on Monday about two hours into your day and say I'm living in Heavenly places yeah exactly see all of us know we're all smiling we know what what it on Monday you know 2 or 3:00 in the afternoon or or once you get up you got all that Monday stuff to do all right but that's your outside guy the inside guy is sitting in Heavenly places it is redeemed it is already up that statue of perfect man in itself but you and me we have to work on the memory reason conscious and affection or we wouldn't need a renewing of our mind renewing of this thing right as a man think is in his heart so is he we know the new birth changes that we were talking last night it absolutely transforms you into the children of light as the Bible says and not the children of Darkness that's why I said many times we we just look at quotes where brother R does say that you you know you were born with this seed and all you were born with representation we know that but I want to ask you a question if you have a question about what we believe here in this church let me give you one example and it should help all of you go to the Book of Luke I've been reading it for the past 3 months the Bible says the unclean Spirit goes out of a man goes out of your what Your Soul so God can't be in your soul and Satan be in your soul at the same time folks it's a two- Soul doctrine that was preached daddy fought against it for years back in the 80s that God give you a soul and sat give you a soul whichever one beat it out and fought it and whichever one the devil ain't my the devil I know is not that strong but the God I know is amen I was lost that unclean Spirit was in my soul it made me do things I didn't want to do sometimes but yes there was representation God knew before the foundation of the world that one day i' get sick and tired of being sick and tired and I come right here to this altar on December the 17th 1997 and gave my heart to the Lord I knew there was a change but I knew I wasn't finished I wasn't finished oh that's it that seed just come to life and I started just preaching and and you no I sat for six months before I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I come to church read my Bible started opening service brother Dale said well won't you teach Sunday school so I started teaching Sunday school then it was a long time after that a year or so after or the year after that and I think brother dick still got the or not him but you still got the tape there's a VHS tape that brother dick made in this church in my first sermon I preached so um and from then on guess what I made a million mistakes backslid yes we all do but we still got to keep going get up and go again get up and go again Muhammad Ali he got knocked down a couple of times but you know what he made it he was the king why but he had to suffer we're going to read the scripture here we got to suffer to rain we just don't become reigning Kings by nothing no we have to come to a place and that's why we believe in the statute of perfect man we believe in justification which what chops off your past sins sanctification where that unclean Spirit that's in your soul that you were born with this adamic nature you were born with a nature with a belly button comes from your parents and then you got to be born again amen amen by the word of God so your representation what comes down and gives you the New Birth by forn knowledge God knew all things second Peter 1 says Simon Peter and the servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that what have obtained now why would we have to obtain stuff why would we have to fight why does the bible give us all these things that we got to do to get salvation if we already got it let's just say say we were lost I like that I was lost I knew that I didn't just come to a realization listen I'd heard sermons I'd read bugs I'd listen to tapes but I wasn't born again I was lost there was an unclean spirit inside of me if you and you know what if you'll realize that you might figure out you're lost and need salvation what brother Dell always said we love to quote Brother D I love this is the best quote I had rather seek every day of my life like brother Donnie's talking about putting on that list absolutely I'd rather seek God every day of my life and know that I had it at the end than to say well I always was eternal I think I'll just I'll just sing a couple of songs yeah I'll read a couple of books and and I'll make sure I don't put a dress on I mean I'll put a dress on until somebody sees me or don't see me right on no it's a light it's a lifechanging this is a lifechanging message it's not a life listen it's not a it's not an it's not a a feel-good every once in a while attitude no it's a life I'd rather fight every day and say Lord how many of us have raised our hands and say God save me amen well where' that come you know God's not going to go oh no you won't have to say that I already know you should know by now now you got another little bird sitting on this shoulder going you ain't nothing you didn't do this you didn't do that you you thought about this you spoke bad about this one he's going to be right here and usually his volumes turned up a lot louder than this one over here I don't know if y'all I live this I don't know I'm just telling you my experience if you don't live it then that's fine pray for me but we do we all live it we all live in humanity but we got up the statue of perfect man though is what's going to work on our memory reason conscious affection imagination that all by the renewing of our mind as this afternoon we'll look at virtue virtue we when you say virtue first thing that pops up or or did would pop up in your head virgin life clean life that's okay but that's not what that virtue means that virtue means power it means power and brother Brown said power without character satanic so we got have the virtues The Virtue the virtues to become a powerful Army amen is everybody with me because listen Peter James John Paul they all had these virtues working in their life so it's not something brand new it's something we need to read in the book of Acts you read in the book of Acts you're going to see the characteristics of Jesus Christ because that's who he was in his people they had got the unclean Spirit driven out of them come on somebody in the upper room and they what was filled with the Holy Ghost then they grew in Grace and knowledge Simon Peter servant Apostle of Jesus Christ to them have obtained light precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and Jesus our lord according as his divine power divine power has given unto us all things that pertain into life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us what to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding brother BR said I reading the other day brother Brown says don't ask for little things ask for big things he's a big God ask for big things well I'm afraid he's going to be a little bit busy you ain't serving the same God I am amen lon's never busy the old song says he's always right there all right and he's never late he's always on time we may think he is but we're going to talk about patience in a little bit whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be what partakers so then we're able to partake of something we're going to partake partake of more of God yes all right if you got God in your soul you you don't need to back up and start cleaning the soul back out it's clean we just need to let it out let that soul out and let it start doing its work and that's what we're talking about and how's it going to do it by the word of God yes no other way except by the word of God all right having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so the first stag is of birth brother R says the first thing you got to do is be born again all right not realize you always was you can now you got to remember there's a there's a there's there's a twofold we look at the Bible and we see that we were talking last night there's some scriptures that we use for the Millennium some we use for the future home some we can interchange there's some that we can't right that's right so scripture has a dual meaning so brother Ram you say brother Ram's got a dual meaning yeah there's a dual meaning you got to be born again you've got to be born from above you got to be born again brother B didn't bring us a way to be born again it's already in the Bible he just brought us back to it what did he say restore the faith of the fathers how you going to restore something that's got 12 thousand different denominations how you going to restore that you can't there's only one truth amen one truth One Faith one Lord one baptism and his brother Richard Negron said he said there's one truth God you got to take me into that one truth not several truths one truth but the first thing you got to do is be born again you've got to be changed and when you're changed you become a new creation one time brother Brown said not the old old one patched up the old one patched up is just the old you you've stuck peacock feathers into your black bird flesh amen it's what brother Ram said but when you're born again it'll take care of itself when you're born again like I've always said take a hog scrub it up put a suit on it and turn him out where's he go he's going to go right back to the mud as we were talking last night you take people don't like the quotes of brother Brown where he says you were a cuckle bear you were a cuckle bir and by the transforming power of God to make you of wheat he had to take the wheat life which is him you have to take the wheat life the wheat germ and put it in the cucker it may still look like a cuar right but inside it's not a cuar anymore because it has had life not just that you all no you know what you know what came to life if you're a cuar cuar right but if you take the wheat life and put it in the cuar you'll act like the wheat life just like this right here if you take what you take the life of a pig take it out put the life of a lamb in he'll look like a pig sometimes he'll act like a pig come on somebody but deep down inside he's had a change and he won't go to that mud hole anymore he'll start acting better he'll start acting right all right you must be born again that is change there's got to be a change let's go down here a little bit further he might make a good neighbor but he isn't a Christian until he's born again that takes care of the always was right listen as we were as I brought my thought back thank you Lord but you know brother B when he's talking you got to remember he's in the mind of God sometimes and he's on Earth sometimes everybody with me he's in the Mind Of God he actually said let's go back into the back part of God's mind so he took us back there to show us that we always were Eternal if we have the new birth if we've accepted it down here all right and if you hadn't then guess what what brother Brown said he said he said what did he say about the the Pharisees he said they did not have represent what was a representation that God by forign knowledge looked down and said they're not going to accept me right therefore I don't have to keep anything for them but I'm not going to let them know that they said brother bam if this is all true of this predestination why are you preaching cuz why would you preach he said I throw the net out I throw the net out I bring it in he said I get crawdads he said I get snakes I get different things he said but I get some fish every once in a while cuz you know what we are not born the word of God as brother Luis was talking about you got to read that and who is this Mez brother Brown said we didn't come word form we came with a belly button we came with an old adamic nature Jesus now listen he came with a belly button but he wasn't attached to his mama that wasn't his mama's blood that was God's blood everybody with me he was attached by normal but remember he had to come like me and you he couldn't come different to save us and to give us New Birth why would he need to come if he just well Nicodemus come on now you're the you're the teacher of Israel you know every quote there is in the book all you got to do is just believe that no he said you got to be born again you got to be changed from what you were to a new creature in Christ that's why there's not many new births it's just a good feeling I I just want us all to be born again that's why I want us to all strive Lord save me yes but now we can't stay there though Hebrews 6:1 says leaving therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ not leaving it and throwing it away no go up higher let us go on to Perfection sure he loves us to be babies but he wants us to be adults he want he don't want us to brother Brown preach why cry why cry speak well you can't speak if you speak a mess you got to speak with the virtues working in your life as I'll read in just a little while or maybe this afternoon he said those those um disciples they waited on God and when they got a little nod they knew what to do with it that's what you and I have to do therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ look let us go on into Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance and that's okay we'll baptize we baptize 20 people we'll baptize whoever needs to be baptized we'll get you started in the right direction but you are going to have to make an effort right to get born again of the doctrine of baptism laying on of hands and resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and look and this we will do if God permit how's he going to do it how are we going to do it he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers what for the Perfection of the Saints I've said many times before and I'll say it again you can get born again we were talking about last night I keep referring back last night if all y'all had been here last night we wouldn't have to refer back to last night but anyway um last night we were talking about that for the perfecting of the Saints there was a chicken yard there was a chicken yard and brother Brown always refers to that about his little Eagle story all right see that then everybody goes oh there it is brother I always was an eagle you got to remember what what was the barnyard what was the chickens denominations he was preaching to people that were stuck in denominations that was already born again but they just didn't realize that he was the mother Eagle come come on people brother Brown's message not brother Brown his message was the mother Eagle that that went over into their church and preached the word and says come out of her Eagles you got to realize who you are right cuzz remember you were born of cuar and you had to be transferred life transferred into you for the Perfection of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till look till we all come to the unity of faith of the knowledge of the Son of God into a perfect man and the measure of the stature of fullness of Christ look that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried away with every wind of Doctrine by what the the slight of men sadly the same preachers amen carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive listen God has never ever ever spoke a false Doctrine that's right ever he can't he is the truth that's why Jesus is the truth that's why this message is the truth but they took this message and divided it up into 700 different places or different ideas but there's got to be one from whom the whole whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies we better get compacted cuz every crack we have the devil's going to stick something in it cuz that's his job that man does his job really well but I got a God that does it way better than that he's want want to heal me he's want to save me not destroy me according to effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body into the edifying itself in love a hidden life in Christ what a beautiful picture it is today of a consecrated life who once enters in with Christ dead to the things of the world hid away with God and the veils dropped around him and all the world shut off then Christianity and religion become a pleasure a pleasure to every believer if you're struggling sure we have struggles but if you're struggling with that you need to get born again I'm sorry I it's just there's two factions working here there's two Powers devil power and God's power there's not an in between all right then Christianity and religion becomes a pleasure to every believer I love coming to bible study I love coming to church I love studying to come and preach to you while you're out doing whatever you're doing brother Dale did it for years and years and years I'm beginning to understand a little bit why he went crazy I'm not talking about that I'm talking about he he would it just went crazy he would come to the house and sit down he' said put on a hunting video and I knew right then that there was a issue going on that he was having a problem with Humanity with y'all's humanity and mine cuz I was lost he was still praying for me too he said put on a hunting video he just sit there put on a hun video and I put one on and he'd watch it he said okay let's go hunting or he to talk about something like that cuz I couldn't talk he couldn't talk to me about the word of God but he had to get that out of his mind he had to get that out of his mind look at brother brandham he looked 70 something years old he just looked old he was only 56 a lot of us have already passed that he was 56 but the body look at Jesus you'd be a man not over 50 years old he was only 33 it was the work they did it you know what it was we're going to get into it the reason I said that we're going to get into it that because you drug virtue out of that man for all those years sister gails the ones that been here long we've drugg virtue out of brother Dale the good part of virtue we've drug it out of him and that's what we do we we we virtue is power you got to have it before you can draw from it that's we'll read that from Brother Bram talks about you got to have it so you got to have somebody that has it before you can draw it from them then when you draw it from them you just get weak in the knees you get brother Brown says I can't even feel my face sometimes my face goes numb amen we were praying for those people the other weekend and and and brother Ronnie and I were discussing a little bit later I cannot remember who we were praying for but all of a sudden you just kind of feel like that that somebody's pulled a plug on your electrical circuit and you just go and I know some of the ministers know that know dad knows it for sure cuz he's done it before laying hands on the sick there's a charge comes out of you and when that person receives something they pulling it from you they're pulling it out of you they're pulling that strength out of you and you know that people get and I don't go by those feelings but there is sometimes when you go man that person really got something because it just it just drains you and it just sometimes will knock you backwards almost but you know what that's the way it ought to work that's the virtue and each one of you should have virtue that we can draw from that we can go to you not like I said before if we got a problem in our Christian life you don't go to the convenience store and ask the convenience owner what to do about something in your life right you know what he's going to tell you have a drink right have a smoke now is that virtue in that no there's no virtue in that but you come and talk to a preacher you talk to a friend of yours that you know is born again and you get what you get strength from that you get virtue from that that's what we're going to talk about about knowing that you ought not to do this I you know reason I think about you look at brother Homer longor look at these ministers that are getting older and man they're just I mean I'm not saying they're falling apart don't get me wrong but they're bodywise we're not made for that kind of an anointing to just be every day just bombarding your flesh you get old looking brother Homer is having some bad issues he's getting better now but uh he that COPD that he's had and to to be a minister that's the first thing Satan should have back is his lungs cuz he can't speak he gets all clogged up and he can't speak well you know what if he shuts us all up he wins he is not going to shut us all up somebody's going to make it somebody is going to take this thing forward and we got listen what I always say lead follow or get out of the way don't hinder well why got off on now cuz that's for this afternoon but anyway but that's what virtue is virtue is not living a virgin life it's drawing strength from from from sermons and strength from even from Brother random if you got the Holy Ghost and you listen to a tape that was that was in the 40s you said boy that's pretty weak no you draw strength from that why there's virtue in that you draw virtue from all that amen even brother Ram I was reading just a few minutes ago talking about altar calls he made alter call Falls up to up to the he died but he said it's not supposed to be not supposed to there's not no supposed to be an altar call in Gentile church that's what he said he said it speak the word and that's supposed to be it he said but we still have them and we'll continue to have them amen we're supposed to come into speaking condition but we still lay hands on the sick cuz that's what the Bible says you can't take it out of the Bible amen so what you draw virtue from from that you come up here what you come up here saying well I don't know if I want that guy to pray for me or not well if you don't then find somebody to pray for you somebody you got some confidence in somebody's got some virtue cuz you know what it's something you need amen it's something you need so here we are going up to Statue of perfect man we got to start down here at the bottom at the new birth which is Faith have faith and be born again we got to have faith for the new birth and then we climb up as that Shadow shows us you start as a little kid and then you come up what to full maturity this is the only age that we're to come to full maturity amen that's right everybody else didn't didn't have the open book they they didn't know what the seals were they didn't know what these different doctrines that we know about now cuz remember the seals is for your Redemption full Redemption Body Spirit and soul working under a closed book they didn't come to the body chain they couldn't cuz they didn't have the seals open amen even Paul Peter the ones we're talking about here there's a furtherment past that you say yeah there is God wants a body change that they couldn't come to but you and I can come to it because of the opening of the seals that's why those seals are so important that's why the Daniel 728 that's why all these different doctrines have to be lined up or you will not get it like Dad said last night it doesn't dechristianize people because I understand when he makes those statements a lot of people say well he's saying I ain't a Christian no he's not saying that cuz you're baby right here if you're born again today as we were talking last night how many times have I said that we get to live in the new city because we're born again here we receive the new birth here we are bride here now there's going to be if it if it's brother BR talks about one in a million if there's one of us there's a million people going to live outside the city it's a million of us there's going to be 100 million people or more than that a billion people live out in in outside everybody with me so the new birth puts us in that position that we can go to that City not go through judgment but the foolish virgin has got to go through judgment because they came to justification and sanctification they didn't go on to the New Birth so they have to brother BR said give their life for the gospel but they going to stay dead for a thousand years and then come up at the white Throne judgment and have to give what an account of what they did I do not want to give an account of my Works do you our righteousness is filthy rags the Bible says but who stood for you the one that is righteous Jesus Christ Christ stood my sin he stood my judgment he went to judgment hall for me and you that's why that's so important to get born again because you get born again you get to live in the city now listen the ones on the outside are as just as Eternal as you are because there's only one form of eternal life there's not degrees but there is position folks come on there is position crowns you're going to be what priest and kings there is position that goes with here now what goes with a position here brothers and sisters it's why it's so important without somebody living these virtues and being sealed by a special anointing we'll talk about it way later and that Capstone which is him sitting down on the church and taking a body change we're going to still be here and just die all over the place somebody's got to come through this and manifest the son of man that's the plan I didn't make it but I sure want to be a part of it don't you you want to be a part of it say I want to be a part of it that makes it an individual I want to be a part of it then I want my kids to be a part of it want my family to be a part of it I want my in-laws to be a part of it why wouldn't you that's right he said un them if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily so you got a cross to bear as I said before there's some people that are enemies of the Cross that'll never be given eternal life you'll never see them in the Kingdom anywhere except the one down underneath all right but there is going to be a group of people giv eternal life cup of water in my name foolish virgin the ones that didn't hear the gospel brother bam said will be judged by what their works then they'll be divided as sheep to goats they'll get to live outside the city right billions of people living outside the city but there's only going to be a bride living in the city with 144,000 as servants to the bride and like I said yesterday that's the difference in the the Millennium and the future home in the Millennium the Bible says we'll build and inhabit in the Millennium that thing's already built it was built before the foundation of the world it was that Genesis 126 man that was the kingdom that was built that's going to down on the mountain after everything else is wiped off again even all this stuff that we did in the Millennium is going to be wiped off for a new Heaven and a new Earth just the way he wiped you off but look you're still here the hand that used to pick up a beer now picks up a Bible the voice in my voice in my mouth that used to curse doesn't do that anymore so he didn't destroy the frame he's not going to destroy the framework of this of this world see that's a great Revelation cuz most people think well this is just going to be annihilated and we're going to go to heaven live on a cloud play a heart I don't know that's not true this is our Earth Satan took it from me and you he didn't take it from God he took it from us yes Adam was the ruler of this Earth Adam the prophet said had the tile of deed to this earth hey when you hold a title deed what's that ownership yes he owned it but forfeited it for Eve cuz he loved her and he said I don't can't you can't destroy her without destroying me what did Moses say when he fell in the Gap he said look God if you going to destroy them people you got to destroy me too he stood in the Gap he stood as what Christ and the bride doing the bad stuff that they were doing but Jesus said I'll take their sin I'll take it on me cuz I'm going to have a bride so there's some that are what enemies of the Cross some go to the cross and get born again or get Justified or get Sanctified but there's a group of people that takes every bit of that and takes up your cross you take up your individual cross and you follow him for whosoever shall save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life from my sake the same shall save it I protest in by my by your rejoicing which I have in Christ look I Die daily I Die daily things I used to do I do them no more things I used to do I do them no more why you're changed you got a new attitude you got God is starting on the renewing of your mind he's starting to let you see things that he didn't let people see before start let you enter into what the mind of God to see now as we see as mature Christians that's why brother Bown he said it's hard to preach predes ination to a group that's not in other words not grown up right remember he said it's not a good word to use out there but the Ephesian Church you could use that word and know that those he forew he did predestinate for knowledge is always first CU it's for knowledge it was before predestination he forne therefore he could predetermine your destination by what you choose and I was thinking about this the other day brother Dale years ago preached on the the U God being infinite and us being finite God being infinite knew that if I never met June and I married the girl that I dated before which was I'm not going to call her name but y don't know who it was how my life would have ended up that's an infinite go infinite God knowing all things how that if you chose this path that's why you say well Prett prove it to me brother Bram said God's knows are the best yeses you'll ever get cuz you're going to go down there how many of us have said this is it this is the will of the Lord this is everything I've been looking for I I me Don don't don't I'm not pointing at you I'm pointing over you under I I me me I'm sorry I didn't I called your name listen but we've all been through it we've all said this is it this is the Promised Land and come to find out it was the Wasteland amen but if we would have listen to God a child of God listens to God it's like we were talking about the other day you know the guy said well God why didn't you save me uh when he got to Heaven he said Lord why didn't you Sav me he said I sent you two boats I sent you an airplane a helicopter and you said no I'm waiting on no if God sends you a helicopter you better get on it so if God says no no so there I prove my point if God says no he knows that if you're going to go down this path right here what your end is going to be and he's going to say no child don't go that way so that's why it's the best yeses you'll ever get cuz then you turn around and say hey uh there's something there's something going to happen God already sees something that's going to happen down at the end of the road here I better not go down that way thank God for that amen remember he's only obligated to his children everybody with me he's obligated to his kids so he's obligated to take care of us aren't we obligated to take care of our kids until they get old enough to fend for theirself not be Boomerang Kids throw them out they come back throw them out they come back I got one so that's okay what some of us yeah well Donnie's got a couple too so praise God you know I'd rather be there than be in the bars I'd rather be there than be in a drug house house we just got to pray for them it's all you know what give you something to pray for if you ain't got nothing else to pray for pray for your kids cuz you know what they'll make you pray for them cuz you love them they're part of you you can't just you can't just kick them out in the world I'm sorry let me get into this you're a chosen generation here we go a royal priesthood a holy nation in other words God saying I'm going to take care of you I'm going to give you a kingdom I'm gonna give you this Earth you can have it but we got to go through these what light afflictions the Earth has got to go through a couple of times of being renovated remember it was renovated in the flood right it's going to be renovated in the battle of Armageddon for the Millennium then it's going to be really renovated when God steps up and wipes everything off except us we can be standing right in the middle of it and be going man this is pretty nice and the world just being wiped completely off cuz we're what we're in glorified bodies he's we've got the new birth and we've come to a body change and we're no more less God than he is except for position we're the bride all right but he said we're bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh that's what he said but we got to come to it it's not just something that just falls on us all right don't you really wish well I do when I was in about the second or third grade I just wish that I knew calculus and algebra and I could just jump up and going into college no I it took me 12 Long Years brother John yeah being the county you I mean when you're third grade you said man I can do your I can do your taxes for you no you can't that would be a disaster please don't ever do that but that's the way God that's the way we grow in God he was an intelligent child I was an intelligent child lost it a lot afterwards but I had to still go through what the required courses I had to go through the required courses right we're going to see here in just a few minutes where where God said that these are required these virtues are required of you they're not a they're not an elective you remember you know what electives are what do they call them now AB what they call them now it's not an elective but it's what it's called oh it's still called an elective I thought called something else alternate learning or whatever it is you know you it's an elective that you really don't need that to graduate but it'd be nice I took what I took was is and and y'all know my story I love math and I was never made a bee till I got to college and and I I could understand calculus algebra that was nothing to me I took a general mathematics course my senior year as an elective didn't need that no more than nothing but you know what I learned how to do fractions and and me and T was the same way I mean we do our stuff in our head cuz he had you know he he had a u a business where he had to know figures and know different and I showed it I and that helped me more than anything oh coach Whitaker good grief he chewed to back and and spit in the in the in the can and and done other things in the classroom but he taught me how to do fractions taught me how to read a tape measure how many y'all know how to read a tape measure that's what I thought not many because you know what that wasn't a required course though now required was algebra required was calculus required were the well this you know what those are required courses yes amen that's required courses we got to go through the seventh grade 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 look that you should show forth the Praises of him that has called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in times past you were not a people oh always was well this says you weren't which in times past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy oh praise God dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims Asain from fleshly lust which war against your soul having your conversation honest among the Gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they Shall Behold glorify God in the day of visitation you're going to help somebody by the way you live or you going to hurt somebody by the way you live that's what we're fixing to get into amen you're going to hurt somebody or help somebody submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake whether it be Kings or Supreme in other words if you got to go to work tomorrow be there at 8:00 don't come in at 8:15 and say well the Lord told me I didn't have to be here till 8:15 you'll probably be asking the Lord to get you another job amen I mean you know you pray for God to give you a job and you sit it home watch television I don't know if God's going to give you one or not he's going to ask for a little effort that's just a life lesson there or unto Governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers for the praise of them that do well this is what I'm getting to for so is the will of God all right so is the will of God that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men that's what we're doing here put to silence the ignorance of foolish men how we going to do that now we got to come to full Doctrine I like good shouting meetings where we just clap our hands and shout and have a good time have a great powerful service and things dance in the bubble as it were but wait then when The Showdown time comes you don't know where you're standing so there's going to be a showdown there's going to be a showdown in your life there's going to be a showdown in in church there's going to be a showdown with the devil because he's got dibs on your body there's going to be a showdown where one day you're going to say Satan this is not yours no more amen that's right we should be starting to say that now but there's going to be a showdown a culmination in other words of everything that was a showdown when Noah preached 120 years one day God said enough that's enough get in the ark I'm going to close the door there's a showdown time in other words what he saying when you when we come and we have the great service like we did a couple weeks ago but we can't live what we preach we all fall short but we keep getting up and going there's a showdown you don't know where you're standing let's get back and find out let's find out what's making us do that listen let's find out what's making us act wrong let's find out what's making us think wrong right that's what the statute to me that's what the statute of perfect man is it's not just living in a no it's how to act to your boss it's how to act to your neighbors it's how to act to these to different people now look now what is it we'll stop right here it's easy to feel the power of God to see it when you believe but then when it comes to The Showdown are you able to possess the thing that you profess to have that's the thing brother you've got to get it we've got to take it it's ours but you'll fight for every inch Fellowship 1962 brother Brown says we're all tried every Christian every son every child that comes to God is tried what not by the neighbor oh yeah well it is but it's Tried by the word of God you're Tried by the word yes you know brother BR said he'll have a brother say something to you off kind of off to see how you'll react to it I a swallow that one have somebody say something to you to see how you act back you know what your child training my child training see if you'll be loyal to it when The Showdown comes what decision are you going to make that's it and he that cannot stand chastisement but goes on with the world he's an illegitimate child and not a son and daughter of God certainly not now but the spiritual minded catches the word lines up with it and the spirit comes down under the shed blood and takes that person amen I want to be took I want to be took by God I don't want be took by the world we've been took by the world long enough I want to be took by God I want to read this one real quick cuz this is one I we read Wednesday night it was a paradox he's talking about the Hebrew children sometimes it looks like you know brother Boyd we're heading toward a fiery furnace something in your life something that we have to overcome and we think man I'm going to get burned up I'm going to get burned up but let's talk about the three Hebrew children how that three men you know what they done all they said was they didn't say I know the seals they said we're not bowing down to that image and you know what they said if we live we live if we die we die but we'll never bow down to that image we'll never bow down to that world and you know what there was there was a F right here that they they heated it seven times it was glowing and was so hot that when the people walked up to throw them in it killed them but what did it do to the three Hebrew children they didn't even smell smoke but what did it do they were bound they were bound you know they and they' have never run away if they weren't bound they were going to give their life for what they believed in but they were bound and here they go they're headed into the fiery furnace and all of a sudden brother Michael the bands are the only thing that got burned off what they thought was going to kill them actually released them same thing with me and you the trouble and trials we go through if you'll look at it that way that hey I'm Bound by something when I get into that furnace I'm not even going to be touched by the smell of sin of this world but God is going to take these bonds and Bounds and he's just going to ashes listen that's the only thing it did let's stand to our feet that's the only thing it did see it delivered them from the bonds that they were bound with it was a paradox sometimes in our own life that Paradox repeat sometimes you're brought to a showdown where you have to make a decision you have to stand on that decision like they did and it look it all works together for the good what did it do it never hurt them it loosed them sometimes we're caught in that position first thing you've got just like the man drowning in the river you got to get that man out of the river before you can get the river out of the man that's right think about that and that's something what a man has to do is come out and make his stand get the thing out what I've been saying for a year and get him out of the thing so he can get the thing out of him then next afternoon we'll talk about we'll start talking about selfish we've got to be the most unselfish people to go up this statue of a perfect man that's right cuz there's things going to be shed away from you that you don't want to lose and our Humanity we we still want to have a little temper why patience with Joe no I ain't got to have no patience with him now he he's his problem see what I mean about selfish we can be so selfish till we make it everybody else his problem
