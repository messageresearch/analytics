[0:02] left y'all with ear plugs and you're
[0:05] here this morning
[0:14] what a waste of chocolate yeah
[0:19] all right let's go to Revelation chapter
[0:21] six
[0:37] thank you
[0:39] next Sunday
[0:41] uh brother Joe will be doing the service
[0:44] here doing the Sunday school and after
[0:47] that brother Bob will be doing it that's
[0:50] the first time I heard of that in a few
[0:51] weeks I know ain't that great
[0:53] you're awake
[0:55] I was gonna call you Friday but next
[0:57] Friday
[1:00] it'll be just fine
[1:04] all right Revelation six
[1:09] verse 7.
[1:12] when he had opened the four seal I heard
[1:14] the voice of the fourth Beast they come
[1:15] and see and I looked and behold a Pale
[1:17] Horse
[1:18] and his name that set on him was death
[1:20] and Hell Followed With Him and power was
[1:22] given unto them over the fourth part of
[1:24] the Earth to kill with the sword he was
[1:26] Hunger with death
[1:29] the Earth
[1:32] okay we're recording Revelations chapter
[1:34] 6 verse 7 let's read it again when he
[1:36] had opened the fourth seal I heard the
[1:38] voice of the fourth piece they say come
[1:39] and see and I looked and behold a Pale
[1:42] Horse and his name to settled him was
[1:43] death and Hell Followed With Him and
[1:45] power was given
[1:47] unto them over the fourth part of the
[1:49] earth to kill with the sword and was
[1:51] Hunger with death and with the Beast of
[1:53] the Earth
[1:54] all right now we're going to stop right
[1:56] there
[1:58] they got you take your Bibles and turn
[2:00] to the Book of Ezekiel 1.
[2:04] now we're going to read Ezekiel chapter
[2:06] one
[2:07] because we're going to cover the four
[2:08] beasts
[2:10] the four combat beasts because after the
[2:12] four steal remember you see no more of
[2:14] the Bride
[2:16] because they're going to Glory
[2:19] and then you start as we were talking
[2:21] about last Sunday was the fifth sixth
[2:23] and seventh seal
[2:25] has got to be in here but but to to get
[2:28] us in the body of Christ and get us in
[2:30] rapturing order
[2:31] we must have justification
[2:33] sanctification of baptism in the Holy
[2:35] Ghost and the word that you are allotted
[2:37] and everybody understand that the word
[2:39] that you were allotted okay because
[2:42] there's a group here with this word that
[2:44] is allotted
[2:46] some are gonna die there were allotted
[2:49] so much word they die but inside here
[2:53] we're going to pick up co5 six and seven
[2:55] maybe later on
[2:56] and show how that there's a group in
[2:59] here that's got to be alive and remain
[3:01] to cause this to happen
[3:04] Christ has got to be here we know Christ
[3:06] is in the word all right and we're
[3:08] anointed
[3:10] by the word of God we have the actual
[3:12] anointing but you got to remember
[3:15] look here you've got anointed false
[3:17] prophet now brother Ryan said the
[3:19] anointing ones at the end time were
[3:20] Anointed with the true Holy Ghost
[3:22] they just used it in a false manner they
[3:25] would take one word out add one word to
[3:28] it all right so there's your there's
[3:31] your Antichrist spirit
[3:34] false prophet anointed false prophet and
[3:38] then the Beast because when we take a
[3:40] Rapture that Beast is going to become a
[3:43] Carne and a pope and he's going to rule
[3:45] the world he's not going to rule the
[3:46] world he's going to begin to Rule the
[3:48] World by what flattering by coming in as
[3:51] a religious man not coming in like some
[3:53] Hitler to take over or some Mussolini or
[3:56] or act madinaj or let's get current with
[3:59] you know Al Qaeda or something like that
[4:01] no it's going to be a religious man
[4:03] it's going to be a religious demon
[4:05] that's going to be left here
[4:06] and everybody's going to be at the mercy
[4:08] of that and he's going to do great signs
[4:09] and wonders
[4:12] in so much the world's going to think
[4:14] that's that God has incarnated this man
[4:16] and he's going to take over the world
[4:18] but we we know
[4:20] number one will not be here because the
[4:23] Rapture will take place
[4:25] before this happens right here
[4:28] if you see the if you see the uh the
[4:32] Beast or the Pope
[4:35] in that condition then you've missed the
[4:37] Rapture all right now who's going to see
[4:40] that there's going to be a group that
[4:41] will see that and that's the foolish
[4:43] version right and
[4:46] dude 144 000 exactly they're going to
[4:50] see this
[4:51] this is what's going to cause my alarm
[4:53] again
[4:54] because they're all going to come down
[4:55] against Israel
[4:57] even the United States at that kind of
[5:00] problem the United States won't be very
[5:01] much but at least we'll still have a
[5:03] little military power Maybe
[5:06] to come against Israel and what's going
[5:08] to happen reason Ezekiel on over in
[5:11] Ezekiel and he'll tell you and in
[5:13] Jeremiah how that God's going to come on
[5:15] stand and fight for Israel all right
[5:17] where there's your battle of Armageddon
[5:19] Battle of forces all right and then
[5:22] you're going to have an atomic explosion
[5:23] burn everything off of the earth that it
[5:26] can and we're going to come back into
[5:27] Millennium because remember the
[5:28] Millennium in the future owns two
[5:29] different things hey during the
[5:31] Millennium we're just gonna in a
[5:33] millennium we're just going to step back
[5:34] into this Dimension and you may see
[5:36] shells of buildings and and all kinds of
[5:38] things it's not going to totally take
[5:40] everything out because the devil's still
[5:42] alive and all this subjects are still
[5:45] alive
[5:46] but they can't work on us because we're
[5:48] all
[5:49] little massage
[5:51] little Jesus is walking around the Earth
[5:53] but there is going to come a time after
[5:54] that thousand years
[5:56] that that Antichrist beast spirit is
[5:58] going to raise back up which is Satan
[6:00] incarnate himself not the pope but this
[6:03] is going to be the man Satan is going to
[6:05] come and he's going to try to fight one
[6:07] more time the Battle of Gog and Magog
[6:09] which that's God's fire that's when
[6:10] everything's going to be burnt off
[6:11] that's when all the The Souls of man is
[6:14] going to be done away with that are that
[6:16] are sinful
[6:18] and then it's just going to be when the
[6:19] future home comes down on the earth
[6:20] there's going to be nothing left after
[6:22] that all right there's not going to be
[6:23] houses laying around or things but uh
[6:27] you know many times we watch those
[6:29] movies about um
[6:31] um after the what they call some great
[6:35] apocalypse
[6:37] that might be what it looks like it's
[6:39] not going to hurt us
[6:41] you say what about radiation you think
[6:43] after we took a change and went in
[6:44] another dimension and come back that
[6:46] that's going to harm us I don't think so
[6:48] so and I'm saying this for us doing the
[6:51] Bible study in a couple weeks that the
[6:53] Millennium is different from the from
[6:55] the new Heavenly New York from the city
[6:57] it's coming down totally different now
[7:00] there's certain things that in there
[7:01] that you can replace that you can
[7:02] replace back and forth
[7:04] but during the Millennium they're still
[7:06] going to be just like brother Graham
[7:07] said they are you know they carried over
[7:09] in the ark Will Ham was on the ark the
[7:11] sand was still there all right but he's
[7:13] going to burn it off that's when John
[7:15] sees in Revelations he sees the city
[7:18] coming down as a broad adorned for
[7:20] her husband so that's due to distinct
[7:24] different things yes they do have some
[7:26] similarities of the same characteristics
[7:29] um brother Brown had many questions
[7:31] about the Millennium that he couldn't
[7:32] answer
[7:34] and ask him could babies be born in the
[7:36] Millennium he said maybe yes maybe no
[7:39] but now when you get to the Future home
[7:40] read that future home book all that's
[7:42] done away with
[7:43] there's no more doubt or or what's going
[7:46] to happen it's going to be a new city
[7:47] that we didn't build because the Bible
[7:49] says you and I are going to build houses
[7:50] and inhabit them during the Millennium
[7:52] right here you say a thousand years
[7:54] look what happened what a thousand years
[7:56] back from now
[7:58] and look how much we've advanced just in
[8:01] a sinful condition in a thousand years
[8:03] so I you know don't dwell on the
[8:06] specifics of how we're going to build it
[8:08] and all this stuff just the Bible says
[8:09] we'll build houses and have it so but in
[8:12] a future home we will not build a thing
[8:15] it's like the great husband went and
[8:17] built you a palace and you didn't have a
[8:19] thing to do with it he's just going to
[8:20] give it to you and you're going to be
[8:21] able to live in it for an eternity but
[8:24] he builds it remember according to your
[8:25] desire that's right for him
[8:28] all right so you are the city all right
[8:30] now let's turn to Ezekiel and
[8:33] um
[8:34] and let's look at this line ox man and
[8:37] Eagle you see the parallel here you got
[8:39] this zoomed into here
[8:41] to these I wrote this little little
[8:44] thing here today for you to look at kind
[8:47] of to keep in your in your mind dude I
[8:49] got a problem
[8:51] but you got it you got your line Ops man
[8:55] an eagle that's your four combat Beach
[8:57] seal one two three and four
[8:59] justification sanctification of baptism
[9:01] of the Holy Ghost we already went
[9:02] through all these and then the word
[9:04] incarnate which is all these three it's
[9:06] not a different work it's working the
[9:09] same Holy Ghost but the prophet said to
[9:11] four Palmer worm candy worm caterpillar
[9:14] and whatever that other one is
[9:16] eat it down so four life Messengers had
[9:19] to bring it back well there wasn't four
[9:20] Messengers it was Luther Wesley
[9:23] Elijah what and then the word came in
[9:25] 1963 the word came to change our body
[9:28] so we are being restored back here and
[9:31] you know what even if you die the words
[9:33] you held when you went down is what's
[9:34] going to change your body right if the
[9:37] spirit of him to dwell in you that dwell
[9:39] in Jesus dwell in you it will also
[9:41] Quicken your mortal body on this side
[9:43] and on that side it's going to bring
[9:45] that body back up okay that's why it's
[9:47] not ashamed and say well I have the word
[9:49] for my day you do and you can die with
[9:50] it but that words what's going to bring
[9:52] you back up right all right but then you
[9:55] got the Rapture after all this
[9:57] let's read in Ezekiel
[10:01] just kind of keep this as a parallel
[10:02] because after the four seal has a
[10:04] Rapture no more bride all right
[10:06] but if you weren't here last week
[10:08] remember seal five six and seven is for
[10:11] the ones that are in this group right
[10:13] here is going to take a body change
[10:15] without dying
[10:18] five six and seven that's what five six
[10:20] and seven
[10:21] not not separate that's what they're for
[10:25] inclusive of all this you got to start
[10:28] here first to get to five six and seven
[10:30] if you're not this right here now you
[10:33] forget about five six and seven that's
[10:34] what I said last night in them in the uh
[10:38] banquet
[10:40] if we can't let our light shine just as
[10:43] being husband and wife
[10:44] father mother Pastor Deacon Elder if
[10:50] your life is hindering somebody
[10:52] from becoming a Christian
[10:54] then you need to start work right here
[10:58] not right here right here because I'm
[11:01] gonna read you some quotes when we get
[11:03] into this
[11:04] where brother Brown says you're not even
[11:05] a Christian
[11:06] if your lock can't shine
[11:09] that's what he said I'm telling you what
[11:11] he said it's gonna be me it's gonna be
[11:12] him so if you got something to do with
[11:14] you can deal with the problem
[11:16] but that's why that you've got to have
[11:19] this basic
[11:21] Foundation before you can take a Rapture
[11:23] so let's read Ezekiel one we're just
[11:25] going to skip through it
[11:26] excuse me because in my Bible
[11:29] I've got it written that this is
[11:32] Revelations chapter one and four
[11:35] which one is chapter one it's the bride
[11:38] already in glory right
[11:40] you've heard that brother they'll caught
[11:41] them
[11:43] and what is chapter four
[11:45] the Rapture right there's an Open Door
[11:47] all right so let's listen now it came to
[11:49] pass in the 13th year in the fourth
[11:51] month and the fifth day of the month as
[11:52] I was among the captives by the river
[11:54] chivar that the heavens were opened
[11:59] Revelations 4
[12:01] 1.
[12:07] after this I looked and behold the door
[12:10] was opened
[12:11] in heaven
[12:14] um
[12:15] right see the parallel
[12:17] ezekiel's tell showing you the same
[12:19] thing that the heavens were open now
[12:21] back to chapter one Ezekiel maybe keep
[12:22] your thumb there at revelation
[12:24] and I saw visions of God
[12:28] what did John turn and see
[12:31] you see Jesus standing there in this
[12:33] golden candlesticks what'd he say he saw
[12:35] a bride we saw one man but we he was he
[12:38] was in in symbol form of the gird about
[12:41] the pants for the golden girdle feminist
[12:43] bride form all right
[12:46] skip verse two the word of the Lord came
[12:48] expressly unto Ezekiel the priest the
[12:50] son of buzzai and the land of the
[12:52] Chaldeans by the river shoe bar and the
[12:54] Hand of the Lord was there upon him
[12:56] and I looked and behold the Whirlwind
[12:58] came out of the North
[13:00] a great cloud
[13:02] and fire and folding itself and the
[13:05] brightness was about it and out of the
[13:07] midst thereof is the color of amber out
[13:09] of the midst of fire now what was that
[13:12] Pillar of Fire Revelations chapter one
[13:19] verse 14 his head and his hair were
[13:22] white as wool his eyes are flaming fire
[13:24] his feet like brass as if they burned in
[13:28] the furnace his voice is the sound of
[13:29] many Waters
[13:31] so who is he talking about
[13:33] you know about Jesus Christ that's what
[13:36] Ezekiel was seeing
[13:37] all right
[13:41] verse five also out of the midst thereof
[13:44] came the likeness of four now look also
[13:48] out of the midst of that whirlwind
[13:52] Ezekiel Saw Whirlwind John saw Jesus
[13:55] because he was already
[13:57] started in Bride form when John saw him
[14:00] Ezekiel he wasn't and in the midst
[14:02] thereof turned back over to verse 8 13
[14:05] chapter 1 Revelation verse 13. and in
[14:08] the midst of the seven candlesticks one
[14:11] life into the son of man clothed in the
[14:13] Garment down to the foot guard about to
[14:15] fight for the Golden Girl what was that
[14:17] showing the bride right in the midst of
[14:19] the seven Church ages
[14:21] Ezekiel seeing the same thing also out
[14:24] of the Mist thereof came the lightness
[14:25] of four living
[14:27] creatures listen to this
[14:32] and this was their appearance
[14:35] they had the lightness
[14:37] of a man
[14:39] now he saw four creatures lion ox man
[14:43] and Eagle but when he saw the vision he
[14:46] saw one man
[14:49] chapter 1 verse 13. because
[14:53] same thing Ezekiel sin Revelations 113
[14:57] and in the midst of the seventh
[14:58] candlesticks one life into the son of
[15:00] man
[15:03] very same thing right
[15:05] and everyone had four faces and everyone
[15:08] had four wings
[15:10] their street feet were straight feet and
[15:12] the sole of their feet was like the sole
[15:14] of a calf foot and they sparkled like
[15:16] the color of burnished brass
[15:19] what does brass always mean judgment
[15:22] and they had the hands of a man under
[15:24] their wings on their four sides and they
[15:25] had their four faces in their wings
[15:27] their wings were joined one to another
[15:29] they turned not when they went they went
[15:31] everyone straight forward I know Ryan
[15:33] had a problem with this one time and I
[15:36] hope I can explain it have you ever seen
[15:38] a hologram
[15:40] you ever seen one of those things where
[15:41] if you turn it a certain way Deanna got
[15:44] one with Spider-Man jumping off of a a
[15:47] building well if you turn it just a
[15:48] little bit further around he's he's
[15:51] swinging turn around a little bit
[15:52] further and he's coming right at you so
[15:54] you see that in the same picture you see
[15:57] Spider-Man I hate to use this for an
[15:58] illustration but you see Spider-Man but
[16:01] if you turn it just a little bit you see
[16:03] what you see them in a different form
[16:04] you see him swinging that's the same way
[16:06] with this there's no way that they can
[16:08] be
[16:11] like that and be lying off ran an eagle
[16:15] and they all be going in the same
[16:17] direction at the same time
[16:19] physically impossible but we're talking
[16:21] about spiritual we're not talking about
[16:22] natural
[16:23] talking about spiritual
[16:25] because actually this is your Holy Ghost
[16:28] the four creatures is the Holy Ghost
[16:30] right
[16:31] the four creatures of the Holy Ghost
[16:33] if you need an OP if you need the spirit
[16:35] of the ox he's right there with you
[16:37] going forward
[16:38] he's not dragging these behind him
[16:41] it's just what comes to the Forefront
[16:43] the hologram
[16:45] I need the spirit of the ox
[16:48] not through not for Spirits I need to be
[16:52] bold like a lion the Holy Ghost will
[16:54] come forward with that and go forward
[16:56] with the line in you not not in me and
[17:00] you
[17:01] man the intelligence of the man if
[17:03] that's what you need in your Christian
[17:05] walk he steps to the front and goes
[17:07] forward so that's is everybody is that
[17:10] okay to explain it that way yeah they're
[17:12] okay because you can't have them in a
[17:15] square
[17:16] because they said they all were facing
[17:18] outward right
[17:19] you can't have them facing outward and
[17:21] going in the same direction physically
[17:23] right but spiritually you can
[17:25] District it's also too you're never
[17:28] going to be back soon that's correct
[17:31] that's correct because if you're going
[17:32] in this Direction with the ox then then
[17:35] see what's happening to these others
[17:37] they're going in a different direction
[17:39] physically right but spiritually if you
[17:42] need the this and it's not you see how
[17:45] close Catholicism is
[17:48] prayers of the Dead Saints they've got
[17:50] traveling Saints as they pray to well
[17:53] that's basically what they get it from
[17:56] from Ezekiel
[17:58] where a spirit comes up and you use that
[18:00] Spirit to go forward with will they do
[18:01] it on a Antichrist way and say well
[18:04] we're going to give you the spirit of of
[18:06] you know Saint Francis which was one of
[18:08] the popes that walked everywhere you
[18:10] know I never I've never been
[18:13] exposed to that until we went out to
[18:15] Colorado hunting and this lady she she
[18:17] was Catholic the mouth Catholic she said
[18:19] I want to pray a prayer for you
[18:21] so she prayed to this saint so-and-so
[18:23] who was a traveling saint
[18:25] who traveled around and did good and had
[18:27] Miracles and stuff like that and all
[18:29] that in his life but he always traveled
[18:31] well they've got a patron saint of
[18:33] travel she showed me the book it's got
[18:35] little sections in it that that's the
[18:36] prayer that you pray if you're going to
[18:37] travel so that's Catholicism but look
[18:40] how close it is to this you're not going
[18:42] to be laying in the bed and call on the
[18:44] spirit of an ox right no that's going to
[18:47] be inside of you as a characteristic of
[18:50] the Holy Ghost but you're going to
[18:51] realize that when you get finished
[18:52] you're going to think man
[18:54] that's what was then made to overcome
[18:56] the same as the ox spirit being in the
[18:59] fourth age for them to overcome that
[19:01] Dark Age that's right everybody got that
[19:04] yes
[19:06] so don't be don't be don't get it all in
[19:10] your head we're not talking natural
[19:11] stuff this is spiritual this is the
[19:13] spiritual being listen and they went
[19:15] everyone straight forward this is the
[19:17] end of chapter verse 9.
[19:19] as for the likeness of their faces
[19:23] day four had the face of a man face of a
[19:26] line on the right side and they four had
[19:28] the face of an ox on the left side they
[19:30] forehead the face of an eagle so there's
[19:33] your line ox man and Eagle everybody got
[19:35] that
[19:36] these were their faces their wings were
[19:38] stretched up where two wings of everyone
[19:39] were joined one to another and two
[19:41] covered their body now listen to this
[19:45] and they went everyone straight forward
[19:48] that's what I just explained to you now
[19:50] we're talking about the Holy Ghost all
[19:52] right
[19:53] the Holy Ghost you've got inside you
[19:55] today that's where those living
[19:56] creatures are you see who it says living
[20:00] creatures not dead creatures living
[20:02] creatures
[20:03] whether the spirit was to go
[20:06] they went
[20:08] who's who's Spirit your spirit the Holy
[20:11] Spirit you got wherever the Holy Spirit
[20:12] goes that's where they're at because
[20:13] brother Brown said he said the four
[20:17] combat beasts are seen no more from from
[20:20] Revelation
[20:22] um from the fifth sea alone he said
[20:24] therefore the Rapture must have took
[20:26] place on the for sale
[20:28] I'm paraphrasing that it's not a direct
[20:29] quote but it's close enough
[20:32] whether the spirit was to go they went
[20:34] and they turned not when they went see
[20:37] they turned not they wine it's like
[20:38] sister William said they can't turn any
[20:40] other way they got to go straight
[20:41] forward all right
[20:45] as for the likeness of the living
[20:46] creatures their appearance was like
[20:47] burning coals of fire and like the
[20:49] appearance of lambs what little lips of
[20:53] Fire
[20:55] it went up and down among the living
[20:57] creatures and the fire was bright and
[20:58] out of the fire went forth lightning
[21:01] and the living creatures ran and
[21:03] returned as the appearance of a flash of
[21:08] lightning
[21:12] now as I beheld the living creatures
[21:14] behold one wheel upon the Earth by the
[21:16] living creatures creatures with his four
[21:19] faces the appearance of the wheels now
[21:22] look
[21:23] Ezekiel Saw the Wheel in the middle of
[21:25] the wheel which was Jesus Christ with
[21:27] the Israelites going through the Journey
[21:29] in the wilderness but who are we a type
[21:31] of
[21:32] Israel that Israel never received the
[21:34] Holy Ghost like you and I do
[21:37] they don't receive the new birth like
[21:38] you and I do actually those most of
[21:41] those that were in the wilderness they
[21:42] died
[21:43] and God said they were spiritually dead
[21:45] never to be revived again
[21:48] in the living oh verse 15 now as I've
[21:50] beheld the living creatures behold one
[21:52] will upon the Earth where
[21:56] also it was down here
[21:58] not in heaven we don't need a holy ghost
[22:00] in heaven we need a holy ghost down here
[22:03] all right
[22:07] the appearance upon the Earth by the
[22:09] living creatures with their four faces
[22:10] verse 16. the appearance of the wheels
[22:13] and their Works was likened to the color
[22:16] of a barrel
[22:19] and they four had one lightness and
[22:24] who's that whose image we're supposed to
[22:26] be in Jesus Christ all right
[22:29] now listen to this and their appearance
[22:31] and their worst was as it were a wheel
[22:33] in the middle of the wheel all right but
[22:35] listen to this when they went they went
[22:37] upon their four sides and they turned
[22:39] not when they went
[22:40] as for their Rings they were so high
[22:42] that they were Dreadful
[22:44] and their Rings were full of eyes about
[22:46] them four
[22:48] remember what the Bible say the eyes of
[22:49] the Lord go to and fro upon the Earth
[22:51] right
[22:52] now listen to this
[22:54] verse 19.
[22:56] and when the living creatures went the
[22:58] wheel went by them
[23:00] and when the living creatures were
[23:02] lifted up from the Earth
[23:06] the wheels were lifted up rapture
[23:09] lift it up from where from the earth
[23:11] Rapture whether so ever the spirit was
[23:14] to go they went that's why brother Brown
[23:16] could say you don't see any more of
[23:17] these combat beasts because what they go
[23:20] the Holy Ghost goes the bride goes all
[23:23] right
[23:25] verse 20. where the soul the spirit was
[23:27] to go they went
[23:28] then there was their Spirit to go
[23:31] and the wheels were lifted up over
[23:34] against them for the spirit of the
[23:36] living creatures
[23:38] was in the wheels
[23:42] the ride
[23:43] those
[23:45] verse 21. when those went these went
[23:50] there's your rapture
[23:52] when the Holy Ghost goes we go if you
[23:54] got the Holy Ghost that's the whole
[23:55] thing's going to interact it's the Holy
[23:57] Ghost right right
[23:59] and who and when those went these went
[24:01] and when those stood they stood and when
[24:04] those were lifted up from the earth the
[24:06] wheels were lifted up over against them
[24:08] for the spirit of the living creature
[24:10] was in the wheels right
[24:14] let's go to verse 34.
[24:17] 24 I'm sorry 24.
[24:19] and when they went I heard the noise of
[24:22] their wings like the noise of great
[24:24] Waters
[24:26] what is Waters in The Bible people
[24:30] like the noise of great what a great
[24:33] amount of people
[24:35] as the voice I circled that word as
[24:40] as the voice of the Almighty
[24:43] in other words the bride's saying the
[24:45] same thing is what the almighty is
[24:46] saying
[24:47] all right the voice of speech
[24:50] as the noise of an host
[24:53] when they stood they let down their
[24:55] wings now let's read 26.
[24:57] and above the firmament that was over
[25:00] their heads was the lightness of a
[25:01] throne
[25:02] as the appearance of a sapphire stone
[25:05] go to Revelation chapter 4.
[25:15] verse 10. and immediately I was in the
[25:19] spirit and behold the white
[25:20] Throne was set in heaven and one sat on
[25:23] that Throne now you all that that went
[25:25] off there all right just trying to give
[25:26] you a parallel because look Revelation
[25:28] chapter 4 verse 6 Before the Throne
[25:30] there was a sea of glass like a new
[25:32] Crystal and in the midst of the throne
[25:34] have you heard that before and round
[25:36] about The Throne were four beasts full
[25:39] of eyes before
[25:41] behind and the first Beast was like a
[25:44] line the second beast a calf third Beast
[25:46] had the face of a man fourth Beast was
[25:48] like a flying eagle
[25:51] so guess what there's your combat beast
[25:54] in Revelations 4 brother Brown said
[25:56] Revelations chapter four was a Rapture
[25:57] right all right Ezekiel chapter 1 verse
[26:01] 20. six and above the firmament that was
[26:04] over their heads was the likeness of a
[26:06] throne as the appearance of a sapphire
[26:08] stone and upon the lightness of the
[26:10] throne was the lightness of the period
[26:12] appearance
[26:14] he didn't say men it said of a man
[26:20] above opponent one sitting on the throne
[26:24] and I saw the color of amber as the
[26:27] appearance of fire round about within
[26:28] from the appearance of his loins even
[26:30] upward from the parents of his ones even
[26:32] downward in other words he's shown
[26:35] above and below
[26:37] I saw as it were the appearance of fire
[26:40] and it had brightness round about it as
[26:42] the appearance of the bow that is in the
[26:44] cloud in the day of rain what is that
[26:45] rainbow
[26:47] so was the appearance of the brightness
[26:49] round about
[26:51] this was the appearance of the likeness
[26:53] of the glory of the Lord and when I saw
[26:55] it I fell upon my face and I heard a
[26:57] voice of one that spoke to continue the
[27:00] chapter two and he said unto me son of
[27:02] man stand upon thy feet
[27:04] and I will speak unto thee and the
[27:06] spirit entered into me when he spaking
[27:08] to me and set me upon my feet now this
[27:09] is Ezekiel prophesying
[27:13] and he said in verse three son of man I
[27:15] send thee to the children of Israel to a
[27:18] rebellious Nation that's us that hath
[27:21] rebelled against me they and their
[27:22] fathers that transgressed against me
[27:23] even this very to this very
[27:25] day
[27:28] listen for their impudent children
[27:32] and stiff-hearted I do send in to them
[27:35] and thou shalt say unto them thus saith
[27:37] the Lord God
[27:39] and they
[27:40] whether they will hear or whether they
[27:42] will forbear for their rebellious house
[27:46] yes you'll know that there have been a
[27:49] prophet
[27:50] among them
[27:52] now you can go on down and you can
[27:54] parallel this from Revelations chapter
[27:56] 5.
[27:58] here in verse 10 and chapter 2 verse 9
[28:02] when I look Behold a hand was sent unto
[28:04] me a lower role of a book
[28:08] what happened in Revelations 5.
[28:11] the book was open right
[28:13] and he spread it before me and was it
[28:15] was written within and was out and there
[28:17] was written there in Lamentations and
[28:18] mornings and woes
[28:20] look at chapter three let's just read
[28:22] this see if this is not familiar with
[28:24] another chapter in the book of
[28:25] Revelation moreover resent unto me son
[28:28] of man eat that thou findest
[28:31] beat this roll now remember they had
[28:35] Scrolls
[28:36] Revelations 10 you got a book
[28:42] in intelligence Revelations 10 the angel
[28:44] come down and said eat the what eat the
[28:46] book
[28:47] eat this roll and what go speak into the
[28:50] house of Israel now Revelation is 10
[28:53] says
[28:55] in verse 9 he went and took the book and
[28:57] eat it
[28:58] and verse 11 says that thou must
[29:00] prophesy again before many people and
[29:02] Nations and tongues and kings
[29:05] eat this roll chapter 3 verse 1 Ezekiel
[29:08] and go speak unto the house of Israel so
[29:12] I opened my mouth and he calls me to eat
[29:15] that Rome and he said unto me son of man
[29:17] caused thy belly to eat and fill thy
[29:19] Bibles with this role that I give thee
[29:21] then denied it and it was in my mouth as
[29:24] honey
[29:27] same thing in Revelations 10. sweet
[29:30] remember when he went in the mouth and
[29:32] he said unto me son of man go gift into
[29:34] the house of Israel and speak with my
[29:36] words unto them for thou are not sent to
[29:39] a people of strange speech of a hard
[29:40] language but to the house of Israel
[29:42] which is who you and I
[29:44] now if you'll continue to read the four
[29:46] beasts you can still read some more
[29:48] about them over in Ezekiel but this is
[29:51] pretty much the parallel
[29:53] showing you I just want to prove to you
[29:55] that it is exactly The Book of
[29:58] Revelation
[29:59] is exactly when the seal break or the
[30:02] seals are finished
[30:03] it is exactly when you see this line of
[30:06] oxman and Eagle come up from the earth
[30:08] and go up into heaven that the bribes
[30:11] there with him so I want first seal
[30:14] second seal third seal four seal Rapture
[30:16] takes place all right
[30:18] there I got that yes the living
[30:20] creatures will sing No More why
[30:23] they're nuts
[30:25] they're gone with us they're not here
[30:27] they they're not staying here for the
[30:29] 144 000 they're going to get the Holy
[30:31] Ghost but they're not going to get the
[30:32] new birth like you and I got
[30:34] all right
[30:36] so here we are
[30:38] with a Rapture taking place
[30:42] four seal
[30:45] but remember
[30:46] as the eagle anointing is on us
[30:52] so is this anointing is bringing this to
[30:56] pass to be the Beast same thing with
[30:59] this when you receive the Holy Ghost you
[31:01] have everything you need
[31:03] but you still gotta what eat the book
[31:06] and sometimes some of us just eat one
[31:08] page at a time
[31:10] but in Revelation 10 it should eat the
[31:12] whole book
[31:13] he took the book and ate it there were
[31:15] no pages left
[31:17] let's say about last night
[31:19] that just you know it may not stir up
[31:20] your hearts you may have just felt like
[31:22] it was nothing said but
[31:24] but when that scripture says
[31:27] honor your wife wives be subjective to
[31:31] your husbands that your prayers be not
[31:34] hindered
[31:35] and folks that means a lot because we
[31:37] got him in prayers because we're still
[31:38] here
[31:40] we're still here
[31:43] so we got prayers that are hindered why
[31:44] just goes the way we treat our life just
[31:46] because the way we treat our husband
[31:49] you know I've always said if you two
[31:51] were one then you know when we took on
[31:53] the name Jesus Christ that's why Daddy
[31:55] won't do them but wait and I won't do
[31:57] one and have a woman keep her her last
[31:59] name if you do that she's not even
[32:01] married to you the way I see it because
[32:02] she must drop
[32:05] her name's Center
[32:08] I'm talking to everybody now not just
[32:10] one person we have to drop our name
[32:12] Center and become who not Mrs Jesus
[32:15] Christ human being sinner
[32:18] you Dale no we become Mrs Jesus Christ
[32:22] that's the only way two can be joined is
[32:24] one right
[32:25] that's the only way you got to take on a
[32:27] name that's what we're going to get into
[32:28] when we start next Sunday
[32:32] not next Sunday next Sunday
[32:37] and I'm sure you all come up and say
[32:38] aren't you going to start next Sunday
[32:42] what's the date
[32:45] I don't know just some Sunday so just
[32:47] don't go be here just don't be here you
[32:49] know
[32:50] but that to me though that really I had
[32:52] been
[32:53] yeah I'm burning up too I'm sweating I
[32:55] shouldn't wear this sweater that's okay
[32:58] but what we're what we're doing is is
[33:02] we're we're missing something just in
[33:05] our everyday walk
[33:07] you know what
[33:09] don't you think that
[33:11] don't you think you're missing something
[33:13] in your everyday walk yeah
[33:15] I am
[33:17] I'm missing something in my everyday
[33:18] walk so I want something to not hinder
[33:22] my prayers to God
[33:26] isn't that right that's right I was
[33:28] trying to find it back over there in
[33:30] it's first Peter what was the first
[33:32] Peter three
[33:35] so that's how many that weren't there
[33:37] last night I'll uh
[33:40] listen to this
[33:42] we're gonna get into it real deep
[33:45] verse 7.
[33:47] first Peter 3 verse 7.
[33:49] likewise your husbands dwell with them
[33:52] according to knowledge who do I
[33:54] giving honor unto the wife
[33:57] as into the weaker vessel and as being
[34:01] heirs together
[34:03] what is heirs heirs ain't like this
[34:06] Ayers is like this
[34:08] not join air with Jesus Christ that's
[34:10] the way you are with your wife
[34:12] that your prayers
[34:15] be not hindered
[34:17] and brother Brown says the reason our
[34:20] prayers are hindered is because we know
[34:21] to do something and we don't do it
[34:24] that's iniquity
[34:25] how many times have we read in Matthew
[34:27] 24 that iniquity will abound and the
[34:32] love of many will wax cold
[34:34] we're writing the scripture people we're
[34:36] right in the day like sister Brandon and
[34:37] I were talking about this morning or
[34:39] last night we were in that we are in the
[34:41] day
[34:42] we're not looking for a prophesied day
[34:44] to come no we're in the day right now
[34:46] this is the day that all this is going
[34:48] to be fulfilled and you know what it's
[34:50] like brother Khan always said
[34:52] don't come up here and say you're some
[34:54] Christian take communion and act like
[34:56] you know something and you live a hound
[34:58] dog life that's right you live behind
[35:00] dog life guess what
[35:02] you're a hound dog thank you
[35:03] you're a hound dog so we're gonna start
[35:06] working on the hound dog that's right
[35:07] all of them because we do have little
[35:09] things little iniquities that we know to
[35:11] do better that's right we know to do
[35:13] different that was striking last night I
[35:15] didn't bring a quote for brother random
[35:17] said that but he said I'll I'll bring it
[35:18] next Sunday and the next Sunday and
[35:20] probably Sunday after that
[35:22] but we got to get this straight first
[35:23] folks we got to have this right here in
[35:26] our life before we can start on a body
[35:28] change
[35:30] okay
[35:31] he give you your wife
[35:34] remember what I said last night brother
[35:36] Brandon said
[35:37] uh feel your love
[35:39] the ones I named the other day Eros and
[35:41] the other one that all had a beginning
[35:43] when we dropped down here into human
[35:45] flesh
[35:46] but that agape love never had a
[35:47] beginning and it would never have an end
[35:49] we just dropped down here in time but
[35:51] guess what we dropped down here in time
[35:52] to do to find our maid
[35:55] and then brother Brown said that mate
[35:57] will carry on with you into eternity
[35:59] when we go back up into puregopula the
[36:02] Bible
[36:03] if you'll look in your Hebrew everything
[36:06] in the Old Testament speaks of filial
[36:09] Love or human love
[36:12] but if you if you pick up love where
[36:14] Jesus says love your neighbor and love
[36:16] this one and love that one that's not
[36:17] excuse me that's not feeling your love
[36:19] everything in the New Testament go look
[36:22] in the Greek
[36:23] everything in the New Testament from
[36:25] when Jesus says Love Thy Neighbor
[36:28] it all goes into agape love it's never
[36:30] filial love in the New Testament Jesus
[36:32] is always talking about Higher Love a
[36:35] higher form of love so take care of that
[36:37] with you and take carry that with you
[36:39] during the week and just pray for next
[36:41] Sunday
[36:42] all right
[36:44] that we always
