[13:48] different topic or whatever but yes I am
[13:51] I'm going to be talking about mothers
[13:53] today um I think I think it's a worthy
[13:56] topic and uh Lord willing I'll have
[13:59] something else to talk about after
[14:00] brother Aaron took all of my scriptures
[14:02] and and just
[14:04] everything but that was that was really
[14:06] good I think that just set set the stage
[14:08] for the day and and I sure appreciate
[14:12] that let's just go to the Lord in prayer
[14:14] Lord we're so grateful to be able to
[14:16] gather around your word today Lord God
[14:17] and speak something Lord to edify your
[14:19] people Lord and I pray God that you'll
[14:21] just anoint my lips Lord God to give
[14:22] some encouragement Lord and just give
[14:24] some give a little pass some roses out
[14:26] to all the mothers and moms in here
[14:28] today Lord and maybe listening in on the
[14:30] internet Lord Jesus Lord we've got so
[14:33] much to be grateful for and we've got so
[14:34] much to be grateful for that you've
[14:36] given your life for us you given you
[14:38] give your life and and certainly know we
[14:40] know that we the reason we've got life
[14:42] here is because that you give us the
[14:44] mamas you give us some mamas that that
[14:47] we could come through and uh that that
[14:49] can mother us and and take care of us
[14:51] when we're babies and set us on the
[14:53] right path in life like brother Aaron
[14:55] was talking about Lord we're so grateful
[14:57] for you today Lord and so grateful for
[14:59] the mothers that you given to us and we
[15:01] ask Lord today that you'll just bless us

[15:15] guide his words Lord Jesus and be with
[15:16] that group and bless him Lord mightily
[15:18] Lord in your name we pray
[15:22] amen so uh my topic today is Happy
[15:25] Mother's
[15:27] Day so verse one of 1 Corinthians
[15:30] chapter 15 says moreover Brethren I
[15:33] declare unto you the gospel which I
[15:35] preached unto you which also you have
[15:38] received and wherein you stand by which
[15:41] also ye are saved if you keep in memory
[15:43] what I preached unto you unless you have
[15:46] believed in vain for I delivered unto
[15:49] you first of all that which I also
[15:51] received how that Christ died for our
[15:52] sins according to the scriptures and
[15:54] that he was buried and that he rose
[15:57] again the third day according to the
[16:00] scriptures you may be seated the Lord at
[16:02] his Blessing to the reading of the
[16:05] word I think everything everything that
[16:08] we do and everything that we everything
[16:10] that we say and our whole Christian
[16:12] journey of course is based on what
[16:13] Christ did when he died and Rose from
[16:16] the grave on the third day to prove that
[16:19] he conquered death hell and the grave
[16:21] and to make a way for that same life to
[16:24] be given back to us so now he gave his
[16:27] eternal life to us this morning I'm
[16:30] talking about life I'm talking about I I
[16:33] just want to maybe just take some time
[16:34] to just meditate on on life I I think
[16:38] that's a worthy topic to think about on
[16:39] Mother's Day you think about in the in
[16:41] the Garden of Eden uh uh that uh God
[16:44] kind of set up the pattern so that there
[16:46] would be a father and a mother and those
[16:48] two together would work together to
[16:50] bring life and he set it up that way
[16:53] that and we're all here this morning
[16:55] because we had a mother I I sure thank
[16:58] God for real mamas real mothers you know
[17:02] in the in the Garden of Eden the the the
[17:04] path was set so that you know you I
[17:06] thinking about this morning just sitting
[17:08] there in the office you when you sit
[17:10] there in the in the hospital watching
[17:12] your babies be born and all that travail
[17:14] and everything the the monitor beeping
[17:16] and everything every every few minutes
[17:18] and you know it seems like in that
[17:20] moment what a horrible time as life is
[17:23] coming forth there life and but then
[17:26] after after the the all of said done
[17:29] there's a little baby being held in
[17:31] Mama's arms and and uh you know we talk
[17:34] we know the process that brother Bram
[17:35] laid out that that uh in in her bellies
[17:38] the the baby's growing and growing and
[17:40] twitching muscles and everything and
[17:41] then the baby's born it comes forth well
[17:44] where's life at maybe the doctor will
[17:46] spank spank it and then the the baby
[17:48] takes that first breath and life comes
[17:49] in life and so we we're born with that
[17:52] that caral life that we give that God
[17:54] has given to us and God laid out that
[17:56] process that we come from Mama but you
[17:58] you see see God made it God made it that
[18:01] way that Mama would be first with life
[18:04] Mama's first mama is the first one with
[18:08] that child all that time she's that
[18:10] little baby's growing in her womb and
[18:12] and you know you know what people
[18:14] sometimes uh they they don't when the
[18:16] baby's growing in Mama's womb they don't
[18:18] recognize limits and things and people
[18:19] walk up to and try to put their hand on
[18:21] the belly and you know cuz they want to
[18:23] feel the movement they want to feel the
[18:24] heartbeat but mama's the one that feels
[18:26] that heartbeat first and Mama be laying
[18:29] there in that bed at night and she can
[18:30] feel the heartbeat feel the movement or
[18:32] maybe not feel the heartbeat but you can
[18:34] hear it when you when you you know you
[18:35] put the sonogram on there and maybe you
[18:37] put your ear up to the belly and you can
[18:39] you can hear that heartbeat and Mama's
[18:41] the one that feels it first and she's
[18:43] the one that experiences it first and
[18:46] brother Brandon would say the first one
[18:47] that receives you in this life is your
[18:49] mother no one could touch you because
[18:52] you're conceived and she Bears you under
[18:55] her heart now you think about how
[18:57] special a mama is that all that time
[18:59] that the the baby's growing and and
[19:00] maturing inside the mama that it's right
[19:02] there under her heart and she's going to
[19:04] have a special relationship with that
[19:05] baby he said she's first she's the first
[19:08] hands that touch you and wipes backs the
[19:11] tears out of your eye she's the first
[19:14] one to Pat you and to love you and to CP
[19:18] over you she's the first one to hear
[19:21] your heartbeat she's the first one to
[19:23] feel you move isn't that interesting
[19:26] just to meditate on that that that there
[19:28] in the night hours maybe that baby's
[19:30] kicking her in the ribs and Daddy's over
[19:32] there sleeping fast and he's getting
[19:33] ready for work the next morning but he
[19:35] he he don't have nothing to say about
[19:37] that experience he doesn't know about
[19:38] getting kicked under the ribs or nothing
[19:40] daddy don't but Mama does Mama's the one
[19:43] that she goes through all that process
[19:45] and all that pain and all that delivery
[19:47] cuz it's set up that way God made the
[19:49] mama special she's the first one she's
[19:52] the first one to feed you when you come
[19:54] out that I'm sorry Daddy can't help that
[19:57] I mean there's some things that Daddy
[19:58] can help you know I remember we' wake up
[20:00] in the middle of the night when when Zoe
[20:02] and Kaye were born and and and and the
[20:04] twins you know that that that nurse and
[20:06] everything and and then Kaye had always
[20:08] I could help cuz Kaye had always she'd
[20:10] get run out of food so I'd had to go
[20:12] down and heat up a little bottle and
[20:13] everything and but there's some things
[20:15] that Daddy can do but but you know
[20:17] really it's Mama's the one that feeds
[20:19] you see Mama's the one that nurses you
[20:22] and it's the first you it's usually
[20:23] Mama's voice that the the the first
[20:26] voice that baby recognizes all that time
[20:29] in that growing in that womb the the
[20:31] little baby's listening to Mama's voice
[20:32] and hearing her hearing her talk and
[20:34] listening to the outside noises and
[20:36] listening to the music that she likes
[20:38] and maybe listening to a tape that
[20:40] Mama's playing and listening to her read
[20:42] the Bible and things and listening to
[20:44] her sing to it and everything and it's
[20:46] when it's going to be Mama's voice that
[20:48] that baby recognizes and mama is usually
[20:51] when that baby's born it's mama that's
[20:53] usually the first one to recognize those
[20:55] little Milestones that brother Aaron was
[20:57] talking about the baby will take take a
[20:58] little first step and and Mama sometimes
[21:00] is the easiest thing for the baby to say
[21:02] so maybe it'll be the first word that
[21:04] the baby says and Mama ends up being
[21:07] first I thank God for real mamas this
[21:09] morning a't it wonderful that God set it
[21:11] up the way that you look you could look
[21:14] back and and see that you come from a
[21:17] real mama that Mama took care of you and
[21:19] Mama Mama was the first mama mama
[21:22] brought you into this world Mama gave
[21:24] you life and she was there to go through
[21:26] all those labor pains and all those
[21:27] things and that's why I think it's
[21:29] worthy it's worthy to give honor to your
[21:31] mother sometimes people will say well my
[21:33] mama talked bad about the message or my
[21:35] mama said something my mom's not really
[21:37] even a Christian but yet she went
[21:39] through all that for you and she set up
[21:40] your life in motion and maybe she might
[21:42] have even said some hurtful words to You
[21:44] and done some things wrong but yet still
[21:46] she gave you life and she raised you up
[21:49] and she shut you on the course of life
[21:50] and so she's got to be worthy of honor
[21:53] honor your father and mother and God
[21:55] will give you long days on the Earth
[22:00] and I I I think maybe this morning that
[22:01] might help you this morning to think
[22:03] about that your mother really is worthy
[22:05] of honor maybe if you don't even think
[22:07] she's worthy of honor but she give you
[22:09] life if nothing else she give you life
[22:11] and she brought you into this world and
[22:13] brother BR want talk about how his well
[22:16] I'll read this scripture in the Bible in
[22:18] Isaiah 49:15 it says can a woman forget
[22:21] her suckling child that she should not
[22:24] have compassion on the son of her womb
[22:27] now listen to what Isaiah
[22:29] God is speaking through Isaiah can a
[22:30] woman forget her sucking child after all
[22:33] that labor and all that travail and
[22:35] having it grow in her womb and and all
[22:37] those things raising up the child and it
[22:39] come from her and she she saw it be born
[22:42] and raised it up how can a mama a real
[22:44] mama forget her little baby and yet he
[22:46] said yay they may forget a woman can't
[22:49] forget her child but he said even if
[22:52] they do forget yet I will not forget
[22:54] thee and now we're going to see you're
[22:56] going to see as we kind of go along the
[22:58] scripture how how that God the word of
[23:00] God is almost like our mother and you
[23:01] can see how a mother in the natural
[23:03] can't forget you but yet God can't
[23:05] forget you even more even more on top of
[23:07] that that God we come from God and we're
[23:10] going back to God and if you come from
[23:12] God how can he forget you he can't a
[23:14] woman can't forget her child and how can
[23:16] God forget you oh maybe this morning you
[23:18] might be going through a bad time maybe
[23:19] you might be sitting on the ash Heep
[23:21] like job maybe you from I forget
[23:23] everything forgotten about you but yet
[23:25] God cannot forget you
[23:29] and brother Brown will talk about how
[23:31] his mother I'm talking about a real Mama
[23:33] this
[23:34] morning these old country Backwoods
[23:37] mamas that didn't have nothing how you
[23:39] know didn't have didn't have nothing but
[23:41] some grease to put on their kids
[23:43] eyes in the morning to keep the keep the
[23:45] mat from foring it didn't have no food
[23:46] Harley but some like like the old Jerry
[23:49] Clow joke some old cat head biscuits
[23:51] that you make in the morning sh they
[23:52] wern't whopping them on the counter to
[23:54] break them things open but they good old
[23:56] a real mama was making their biscuits
[23:58] from scratch and brother Ram will talk
[24:00] about how his mother would walk away
[24:02] from the table so he could have
[24:05] something to eat why because a real mama
[24:08] is going to make sacrifices now we
[24:10] talked so many times in Sunday school
[24:12] and whatnot about how a real Christian
[24:13] Life is full of sacrifices well how
[24:15] about a real Christian Mama to make
[24:17] sacrifices and that's why a real mother
[24:20] is worthy of honor you think look back
[24:22] through your own life and recognize all
[24:24] the sacrifices that your mama made for
[24:26] you all the sacri I remember just
[24:29] growing up I'm going to throw some roses
[24:30] at my mama this morning she might be
[24:31] listening in but I remember when when we
[24:34] were little she she quit her job and she
[24:36] she raised us and when we got older
[24:37] about in high school or middle school
[24:39] something like that she did go back to
[24:41] work but we'd come home and I remember
[24:43] when I was a kid just always thinking
[24:45] like we she she'd work as a school
[24:47] teacher and then she'd come home and she
[24:50] would cook dinner for us like I I was I
[24:52] I remember thinking she cook okra and
[24:55] chopped steak and mashed potatoes every
[24:57] night I was like what I'm I'm talking
[25:00] about sacrifices now sacrifices because
[25:03] it's a real a real mama is going to
[25:05] sacrifice for her children when she's
[25:06] tired she's going to pray at night when
[25:08] she's tired she's going to sit around
[25:10] that like that Fifth Gospel that brother
[25:12] Aaron was talking about and let sit her
[25:14] children around her knees like like Mama
[25:16] Wesley John Wesley's Mama gather all the
[25:19] kids around so that to kind of give them
[25:21] a little a little Bible story and teach
[25:22] them that's a real mother a real mama is
[25:25] going to make sacrifices and that's why
[25:27] they're worthy of honor why cuz a real
[25:30] mother a real mother there's something
[25:32] in there's something in a real mother
[25:34] that she just loves life she loves even
[25:38] you know when we I just I you know I got
[25:40] three daughters and there at the house
[25:43] we got all these little animals and
[25:44] things and we got little rabbits and
[25:47] little a little Chihuahua dog and you
[25:49] know like but why because there's
[25:50] something in these little girl the girls
[25:52] will just take the little rabbit and
[25:54] they'll hold it you know and they they
[25:55] take the Chihuahua dog and put it like a
[25:57] little baby because why because there's
[25:58] something in a girl that that she wants
[26:02] to be a mama and I'm that's nothing to
[26:05] be ashamed about now what one of my
[26:07] girls was telling me the other day you
[26:09] know you talk about what what do you
[26:10] want to do in life and and whatnot one
[26:12] of my girls was telling me the other day
[26:13] I want to be a mama you know the rest of
[26:16] the world thinks that that that ain't
[26:18] nothing good about that but I I I think
[26:22] I think that's something to put up on
[26:23] the pedestal because that's one of the
[26:25] to to to to want to have a desire to
[26:28] bring life into the world and mother it
[26:30] and set it on the right course of life
[26:32] that's that's something to be admired
[26:35] and you see a real mama loves life a
[26:37] real mama now it it might be Troublesome
[26:39] to go through all those labor pains and
[26:41] hear that monitor beeping in her ear
[26:43] when she's in the hospital with the baby
[26:44] coming forth but yet she loves life and
[26:47] you see these these fake masam these
[26:49] unreal mamas like I saw in the news the
[26:50] other day this this woman took her baby
[26:52] and put it in a in a garbage bag and put
[26:55] it behind a Walmart or something because
[26:57] that's that's not a real Mama a real
[26:59] mama like jocked praying down in Egypt
[27:02] while all the brother B said they were
[27:03] witches Gathering up all the all the uh
[27:06] Israelite babies and and and trying to
[27:08] kill them and stuff that that ain't a
[27:09] real that ain't a real Mama but brother
[27:12] R would say how mother lives little
[27:14] babies how she puts him on the
[27:17] chin mother would wash you now you think
[27:20] about what think about just picture this
[27:22] in your mind now mama just loves loves
[27:26] the little babies cuz there's some
[27:28] something in her she going to pick that
[27:29] little baby up and just put it right up
[27:30] under her chin and hold it all through
[27:34] the midnight hours losing sleep because
[27:37] there's something in her that she just
[27:39] that's how she's made mother would wash
[27:42] you and kiss you and would say how
[27:43] pretty you was and put you to bed at
[27:46] night if a little door would be open a
[27:49] little draft coming through something
[27:50] like that she'd run real quick and shut
[27:52] the door cover up the little baby and
[27:55] you know she taking it she loved you see
[27:58] she loved you she loved that poor little
[28:01] thing that God had give her that was
[28:04] helpless and it couldn't help itself so
[28:07] she loved that little baby and she just
[28:10] kiss her little babies and play with
[28:12] them because she was a real mother oh
[28:16] that's a real mama that'll gather up her
[28:18] little baby and and and every every
[28:20] three or four hours in the middle of the
[28:21] night it keep waking up and Mama's there
[28:23] to feed it and take care of it and
[28:25] swallow it and change it diapers and all
[28:27] those things are real mother Mother Down
[28:29] in Egypt jocked praying down in oh
[28:32] that's a real mother a real mother that
[28:34] would pray that God would give her child
[28:37] and pray that God would lead
[28:39] her and pray and brother Brown would say
[28:42] those old witches would go in there that
[28:43] killing babies and take their little
[28:45] feet and bang them up against the wall
[28:46] and kill them and throw them in the
[28:47] crocodiles the poor mother would get on
[28:49] her knees and she'd cry oh don't take my
[28:52] baby don't take my baby oh what a time
[28:55] they were having that's unreal mothers
[28:57] but there's something in a real mother
[28:59] that wants to take care of
[29:01] life now I I want to
[29:05] say this morning that sisters there's
[29:08] there's where you find you know
[29:09] everybody's got a purpose everybody's
[29:11] got a calling in their life and sisters
[29:13] this morning there's where you'll find
[29:15] your real calling and your real purpose
[29:17] to bring life into the world and I like
[29:20] how brother Aaron was framing it this
[29:21] morning that maybe maybe in your life
[29:23] you you never had the opportunity to
[29:25] have children maybe maybe you're you
[29:27] know you're a step mother and and all
[29:29] those thing we're putting all that Under
[29:30] the Umbrella of mothers this morning
[29:32] because maybe you're maybe you're a aunt
[29:34] and you're you know sometimes these
[29:36] large families mama can't really be
[29:38] their mother you know if you got 12 kids
[29:40] or nine kids or whatever running around
[29:42] and an older sister will step in and
[29:45] maybe that sister don't really have any
[29:46] kids of herself but yet she's still a
[29:48] mama I I remember Monica talking about
[29:50] one she's got one of her older sisters
[29:52] that would change their diapers and she
[29:54] was the mama and you know and and almost
[29:56] like she had a different relationship
[29:57] with that sister than the other sister
[30:00] because she was more like a mama so
[30:02] that's what I'm putting all that under
[30:03] that umbrella I'm I'm not trying to put
[30:05] nobody out your mom but being a mama
[30:08] taking care of that life taking care
[30:11] that that is where you'll find your real
[30:13] calling and purpose now that's what Paul
[30:15] told Timothy in 1 Timothy
[30:18] 2:15 when he said she shall be saved in
[30:21] childbearing if they continue in faith
[30:25] and charity and Holiness with sobriety
[30:28] that's one of them scriptures that we
[30:29] stumble over a lot of times am I going
[30:31] to be saved because I have children but
[30:33] listen to why my brother B said he said
[30:34] not by having a baby makes her saved but
[30:37] because that she's raising children
[30:41] doing her
[30:43] Duty oh when you find yourself falling
[30:45] in line with your purpose and your
[30:48] purpose this this is your purpose oh
[30:51] that's why we give real honor to these
[30:52] sisters because you're you're right in
[30:54] line with what God wants you to do and
[30:56] listen what he said he said not raising
[30:59] cats
[31:00] dogs and what more to take the place of
[31:03] a child as they do today giving it a
[31:06] mother's love so that she can go out and
[31:08] run around all night some people do that
[31:11] sorry but they do it that's awful rude
[31:13] for me to say but the truth is the truth
[31:16] they don't want a baby to be tied down
[31:19] with it now there's a real mother that
[31:22] don't mind being tied down by a baby
[31:25] that don't mind it but you see my my
[31:29] girls they go home and they pick up them
[31:30] rabbits and things and the Little
[31:32] Chihuahua dog and there's a time and a
[31:34] place for that but one day they'll come
[31:36] to a place of maturity and where life
[31:38] will just fall into place where they be
[31:40] able to fulfill the purpose in life that
[31:42] God has God has rais them up for it and
[31:44] they'll be able to hold a baby in their
[31:46] arms but you know you see you grow up
[31:48] and when you trade that when you trade
[31:50] that purpose well I'd rather have some
[31:52] little fruy dog instead of having a baby
[31:55] I'd rather hold a little fruy dog in my
[31:56] arms and baby that thing and push it
[31:58] around a little stroller and put nappy
[32:00] diapers on it and all sorts of nonsense
[32:02] like that you see you're you're
[32:03] betraying the purpose and the calling
[32:05] that God has for your life they listen
[32:08] he said they don't they don't want a
[32:10] baby to be tied down with it but in
[32:13] childbearing if she continues in faith
[32:16] Holiness and all sobriety she'll be
[32:18] saved why because she's doing what God
[32:20] called her to do God called your sisters
[32:23] to be a mother may mothers be real
[32:26] mothers this morning may brother r say
[32:28] may they dismiss that
[32:30] babysitter oh some of these things are a
[32:33] little bit rough ain't it it may they
[32:36] maybe may they dismiss that and I don't
[32:38] think any of us this morning are like so
[32:40] we wealthy and well off that we just got
[32:42] a a nanny there all the time to do the
[32:44] mothering and all that stuff for us but
[32:46] but certainly what he's saying is let's
[32:48] let's be real Mamas and take care of our
[32:50] kids cuz God raised us up for that
[32:53] purpose keep away from the barroom and
[32:55] throw down those cigarettes and dress
[32:56] like a mother ought to and be a real
[32:59] mother and a real mother is worthy of
[33:02] honor in Ephesians 6:2 it says honor thy
[33:06] father and
[33:07] mother which is the first commandment
[33:09] with promise now you think that all
[33:12] these Commandments going down the list
[33:14] Thou shalt not Thou shalt not and then
[33:16] it gets to honor thy father and mother
[33:18] and there's a promise that goes with it
[33:21] praise the Lord I my life can be
[33:23] extended if you want a long happy life
[33:27] on honor your father and mother and then
[33:30] you begin to realize how really evil it
[33:32] is to look at your father and mother
[33:35] with reproach and do them dishonor and
[33:38] look at them with hatefulness and things
[33:40] knowing that they brought you into the
[33:42] world and they went through all those
[33:44] labor pains and sacrificed and labored
[33:46] early on in their life and and and maybe
[33:48] walked away from the table so you could
[33:50] have something to eat and not give them
[33:52] honor honor your father and mother and
[33:54] brother Ram would say there is not
[33:56] enough honor that we could give to a
[34:00] mother which is why we're speaking on
[34:02] these things this morning brother R will
[34:05] say what that child will be will be
[34:07] based upon the way that mother starts
[34:09] that child on the path that it must
[34:11] travel mother has the responsibility
[34:14] from God to place that child on the
[34:16] right Road and I think that's why
[34:19] mothers has a special little touch I
[34:22] maybe maybe this morning you might think
[34:24] that you don't really have nothing to do
[34:25] in the great plan of God but you think
[34:27] that that you're like sitting back there
[34:29] with that little child and you can point
[34:31] it in the right direction and say go you
[34:35] can set it up and and get it situated
[34:40] maybe that child's going to be a
[34:41] minister one day maybe that child's
[34:43] going to lead many people to the to
[34:45] Christ maybe that child is going to have
[34:47] a great purpose one day or whatever it
[34:50] is maybe its purpose is going to be a to
[34:52] be a businessman to help the church to
[34:54] be able to uh send money overseas to be
[34:57] to missionary or whatever but whatever
[34:58] the purpose is that mother is framing
[35:01] that child's life to set it up to go in
[35:04] the direction to fulfill the purpose
[35:06] that God has for her you think about
[35:08] Moses where brother Ram said a man like
[35:10] Moses was because he had a Gods sent
[35:13] mother the reason oh Moses sitting there
[35:15] on his mama's knee being raised in
[35:17] Pharaoh's house but God positioned it so
[35:19] his real mama could sit there and tell
[35:21] him God has raised you up for a purpose
[35:24] and begin to testify to him and witness
[35:26] to him that I I've been I you your
[35:29] father and I prayed for you and and we
[35:31] were calling out to God that God was
[35:33] send to deliverer and framed it up that
[35:35] that Moses would know who he was because
[35:38] his mother framed up his life that's
[35:41] what helped mold the character that
[35:42] Moses was that's what a mother mother
[35:45] does is mold her children and set them
[35:49] on the right
[35:52] path you know we like to read maybe on
[35:55] Mother's Day that proverbs 31 that talks
[35:57] about a a good virtuous woman and
[35:59] everything but have you ever read how
[36:01] that starts off in Proverbs 31 ver verse
[36:04] one it says the words of King
[36:07] lmel and it says the prophecy that his
[36:10] mother taught him now that whole
[36:13] proverbs 31 that talks about a virtuous
[36:15] woman rising up taking care of her
[36:17] family all the things she does that
[36:18] whole thing that whole that whole
[36:20] proverb is about something that King
[36:23] lel's mama taught him that King lel's
[36:26] Mama fr named up his path and set things
[36:29] in motion so one day Kem glenil could WR
[36:32] be writing that down because as mama
[36:35] taught him in Proverbs 31:26 it says she
[36:38] openeth her mouth with
[36:40] wisdom now there's a good Mama that when
[36:43] you need some counsel and you need some
[36:44] advice you can turn to your mama and
[36:46] she'll say she'll she'll guide you on
[36:47] something that's happening in the
[36:49] schoolyard something how to deal with a
[36:50] bully how to deal with some kind of
[36:52] problem in your life H how to deal with
[36:55] that that young girl or that young boy
[36:57] that the children are talking to they
[36:59] can turn to Mama and say well what what
[37:00] should I do in this situation and in her
[37:03] tongue is the law of kindness why cuz
[37:06] she's setting the course of that child's
[37:08] life and you look back to a real a real
[37:10] good Godly mama and she'll she'll frame
[37:13] up their the the way that the children
[37:15] are so that everybody else can look at
[37:17] them and say they were raised right now
[37:20] isn't that a mama's that's the ultimate
[37:22] testimony that child was raised right
[37:26] when you can look at somebody that say
[37:27] it says yes sir no sir that's respectful
[37:30] of their Elders that honors their father
[37:32] and mother it's because that that Mama
[37:35] trained up the child that's what
[37:37] Proverbs 22:6 says train up a child in
[37:40] the way that he should go get a pointed
[37:43] in the right direction get them framed
[37:46] up so that when they're young they can
[37:48] see Mama and Daddy praying they can see
[37:50] a Godly house get them framed up in the
[37:52] way and when he is old he will not
[37:54] depart from
[37:56] it Charles Spurgeon said I can't tell
[37:58] you how much I owe to the solemn word of
[38:01] my good
[38:02] mother and and Charles Spurgeon said
[38:04] this now I I love this quote listen to
[38:06] this now he said I remember on one
[38:08] occasion her praying this now Lord if my
[38:11] children go on in their
[38:13] sins it won't be from my ignorance that
[38:16] they perish and my soul must bear a
[38:19] swift witness against them at the day of
[38:21] Judgment at if they lay not hold of
[38:24] Christ and Spurgeon said that thought of
[38:27] a mother's bearing Swift witnessed
[38:29] against me pierced my conscience and
[38:32] stirred my heart now that's a a real
[38:35] mother is she going to lay the truth
[38:36] down if if if at the end of the road
[38:39] after all I've done and all the travail
[38:42] of my life that my children get there at
[38:44] the end of at the judgment and say well
[38:45] I just never believed in Jesus that
[38:48] she's just going to have to bear a swift
[38:49] witness against him that even mama would
[38:52] do that no that's a real that's a that
[38:54] sounds harsh that sounds rough but thank
[38:57] God for for a real mama that will lay
[38:58] the truth out like
[39:00] that you know I think sometimes you what
[39:04] really Bears a good impression on young
[39:06] people is when they can hear somebody
[39:07] praying through the
[39:10] door hear those prayers coming through
[39:12] the closet door or the or the down the
[39:14] hall in the middle of the night and
[39:16] something begins to pierce your
[39:17] conscience and
[39:19] recognize that there's a need in your
[39:22] life and what like that scripture that
[39:24] brother Aaron read this morning your
[39:25] mother's instructions that she's you
[39:28] that she's framed up as you are sitting
[39:30] around her her her knees when you're
[39:32] young will actually be an ornament on
[39:34] your
[39:35] life my son hear the instruction of thy
[39:38] father says Proverbs Chapter 1 and
[39:40] forsake not the law of thy mother for
[39:42] they shall be an ornament of Grace under
[39:45] thy head and chains about thy neck now
[39:48] we joke about how we were when we were
[39:49] young you know in the schoolyard we'd
[39:51] have our our our our gold chains and
[39:53] those kind of ornaments and thing now
[39:55] you know that that's an ornament
[39:58] that you you wore in your in your sin
[40:00] and your debauchery and that kind of
[40:01] things but you think about an ornament
[40:03] that will actually set you apart from
[40:05] the
[40:06] world that will give you honor and
[40:09] distinction is if you obey what your
[40:11] mama said let's do what your mama said
[40:15] and it will make you different it will
[40:17] be it will be a a Grace and a beauty
[40:19] upon your life young ladies it will be
[40:22] uh it will be something that
[40:23] distinguishes you from others young men
[40:26] if you just do what your mom ISS cuz a
[40:28] good mama will set you on the right
[40:31] path Abraham Lincoln said like brother
[40:34] Aaron was saying again this morning I
[40:35] told y'all he was hitting all my points
[40:37] he said all that I am or hope to be I
[40:40] owe to my angel mother and you know
[40:43] Abraham Lincoln had a terrible bad start
[40:45] Abraham Lincoln's whole life was fraught
[40:46] with looked like just a lot of misery
[40:48] and and heartache and trouble and
[40:50] everything but he you now we look back
[40:52] and we say well he was one of the
[40:53] greatest presidents that this nation
[40:55] ever had and it was all because his life
[40:57] was framed by his mother he was poor he
[41:00] didn't have no background he didn't have
[41:01] any education or money or something that
[41:04] could have helped him like Washington
[41:05] had he was raised in that little old
[41:07] cabin in in up in Kentucky he never even
[41:10] owned a B book in his life until he got
[41:12] a Bible and Fox's book of Martyrs at 21
[41:15] but one thing Abraham Lincoln had was a
[41:17] good mother and you we know his brother
[41:19] Aaron was laying out for us said his
[41:21] mama died his real mama died when he was
[41:23] about 9 years old and then he had that
[41:24] good stepmom that took care of him so he
[41:26] ended up having two good Mamas that
[41:29] framed up his life and set him on the
[41:31] path and he said I remember my mother's
[41:33] prayers and they have always follow me
[41:36] they have clung to me all my life he
[41:39] said in another place my earliest
[41:41] recollection of my mother is sitting at
[41:43] her feet by the Fireside at night
[41:45] listening to her tell the different
[41:46] stories and legends that she had
[41:48] gathered in her youth he said I feel
[41:50] that whatever may happen I shall never
[41:53] forget the maternal tenderness that
[41:55] stole into my soul in the darkest hours
[41:58] of my life in other words what he's
[42:00] saying there in that in The Darkest
[42:01] Hours of his life maybe when he's in the
[42:03] middle of that Civil War battle maybe in
[42:05] in the midst of all the the trouble that
[42:07] his wife gave him because he his wife
[42:09] was just a bitter peel most of his life
[42:11] but in those dark hours he'd remember
[42:14] what his mama said cuz his mama set him
[42:17] on the right course a child listens to
[42:19] its mother some little touch about that
[42:21] mother when it's hurt it'll go to the
[42:23] mother for consolation before it'll go
[42:25] to the father because why she was first
[42:29] mama was
[42:30] first why is it that a little child when
[42:33] it gets when it falls down and scrapes
[42:35] its knee it'll run to
[42:37] Mama mean old daddy a lot of times it'll
[42:39] just run right by but it'll run to Mama
[42:42] cuz Mama was first it come forth from
[42:44] mama mama was there to nurse it and you
[42:47] know scripture scripture compares the
[42:49] word to our
[42:51] mother and Galatians 4:26 it says
[42:54] Jerusalem which is above is free which
[42:56] is the mother of of us all we certainly
[42:58] we come from the word isn't that true
[43:01] how in the gospel when you it kind of
[43:04] parallels the natural in the natural
[43:05] when you you look on your you take one
[43:07] of those DNA tests or you you look in
[43:09] your genealogy record and you can you
[43:11] can find out who your mama and who your
[43:13] daddy is and then that gives you
[43:14] confidence well when you're born of the
[43:16] word you can look back and you say I I
[43:18] know where I come from I know that New
[43:20] Jerusalem now not old Jerusalem not old
[43:22] Jerusalem of this world but a New
[43:24] Jerusalem that come forth that was
[43:26] molded by the word word of God that God
[43:28] come he brought that down from God out
[43:30] of Heaven just like he brought your life
[43:32] from God down out of heaven and you know
[43:34] where you come from because you come
[43:35] from him and and the word also compares
[43:38] to our mother because elshad oh you you
[43:41] turn to Genesis chapter 7 17 when
[43:43] Abraham was on his walk and he come to a
[43:45] place where it says El shedi came and
[43:48] talked to him and said walk with me and
[43:50] be thou perfect and it used that term El
[43:54] shedi because and brother BR laid it out
[43:56] there that El shed means the breasted
[43:59] one it paints a picture in your mind of
[44:02] the alls sufficient God that whatever
[44:04] you have need of you can turn to him
[44:06] like a little child that's been born and
[44:08] you can turn to him for whatever you
[44:10] have need of whatever you have need of
[44:13] you know the Bible says in 1 Peter
[44:15] chapter 2:2 as newborn babes desire the
[44:18] sincere milk of the word that you may
[44:21] grow thereby so when we're born of the
[44:23] Gospel we turn to him we turn to El Shi
[44:26] just like a little baby at his mother's
[44:28] breast and draw everything that we have
[44:31] need
[44:32] of what are we drawing this morning
[44:34] we're drawing strength encouragement
[44:37] we're drawing help and Care from our
[44:39] mother from from the word of God just
[44:41] like a little baby you know we were we
[44:44] were talking the other day about how
[44:45] when a when a woman has a baby you don't
[44:47] give that baby water because it'll kill
[44:50] it but what you give it is that Mama's
[44:52] milk and in that Mama's milk is
[44:55] everything that it has need of and the
[44:56] same thing in the gospel the word of God
[44:59] has everything that you need in it what
[45:01] does it what does Mama's milk has it's
[45:02] got antibodies in it it's got white
[45:05] blood cells it got it's got Li something
[45:07] called lysozyme which which actually
[45:10] will repair it will it will fix things
[45:12] that are wrong it's got some it's got
[45:15] fatty acids it's got growth factors and
[45:17] hormones it's got stem cells that will
[45:20] repair things that are wrong in that
[45:22] baby it's got and it's got a dynamic
[45:25] composition that will change change as
[45:27] the baby's needs grow over time now you
[45:30] tell me that ain't what the word of God
[45:32] does as you as your needs change over
[45:35] time you will find and else sh I
[45:37] everything that you have need of that's
[45:40] why Philippians 4:19 says my God shall
[45:43] supply all your need according to his
[45:45] riches and Glory by Christ Jesus so
[45:48] whatever your need is this morning if
[45:50] you need healing if you need salvation
[45:53] if you need a little pick me up if you
[45:54] need a fresh Assurance you can turn like
[45:57] a little baby till L shed ey and draw
[45:59] from him everything that you
[46:01] need now now Mother's Day has become
[46:05] Mother's Day has just become just
[46:06] another date on the calendar it's become
[46:09] like we say another Hallmark holiday
[46:11] something where we could just go to the
[46:13] store and we pick up flowers and pick up
[46:15] cards to give to mama you know I was
[46:18] reading about how Anna Jarvis that the
[46:20] woman that found in Mother's Day she got
[46:22] so disillusioned with Mother's Day until
[46:25] she actually wanted it to be taken from
[46:26] the the calendar because she began to
[46:28] realize that Mother's Day ain't just
[46:30] something on the calendar well we we we
[46:32] we'll send a little quick text to our
[46:34] mama or or or send some some money or or
[46:37] gift like that that ain't what Mother's
[46:39] Day is about and you can see where
[46:40] brother Brandon would even say the same
[46:42] thing he said Mother's Day is supposed
[46:44] to be something that we honor our
[46:46] mothers
[46:47] 365 days of the year not when it just
[46:50] look kind of pops up into your head well
[46:52] I I guess I guess I need to need to
[46:55] think about Mama for the this quarter
[46:57] for 30 minutes this quarter every 3
[46:59] months give her give her a little call
[47:00] home and maybe send us some money he
[47:02] said now Mother's Day like this is a
[47:04] racket make a lot of FL money out of
[47:07] flowers and things but he said Mother's
[47:11] Day should be every day not to send her
[47:13] a bunch of flowers on Mother's day but
[47:15] to love her and to care for her
[47:18] 365 days and nights Through The Years
[47:21] she'd appreciate a whole lot more now
[47:23] listen we I know on Mother's Day we give
[47:26] flowers and those kind of things but
[47:27] listen to what brother randam said she'd
[47:29] appreciate a whole lot more yes she'd
[47:32] appreciate a whole lot more just sit
[47:33] down and talk to her just a little
[47:37] bit write her a line Pat her on the
[47:40] cheek kiss her on the cheek tell her you
[47:44] love her now those are the things that
[47:46] matters to
[47:47] Mama what matters to Mama is you come
[47:50] sit down beside her on the rocking chair
[47:52] and on the front porch and just sit with
[47:53] her a little while and talk things over
[47:55] and tell her how much you appreciate her
[47:57] cuz Flowers and Things they'll fade away
[48:00] and they'll go that back to the dirt but
[48:02] what she wants is you that's what Mama
[48:05] appreciates he said it'll go a lot
[48:08] farther than all the flowers that you
[48:11] could buy from the floors now that's
[48:13] what the prophet God said that's what he
[48:15] said he said we might you think well we
[48:17] might have bought roses and cards and
[48:19] gave money and Gifts what mama would
[48:21] rather have you think about that this
[48:22] morning that Mama would rather have your
[48:24] words and your conversation
[48:28] and your fellowship and your
[48:31] companionship your
[48:32] presence your kiss your
[48:36] appreciation because it was your mother
[48:38] that gave you
[48:39] life she gave you life you think I I
[48:43] think sometimes it escapes the children
[48:46] sometime and myself included how much
[48:49] mamas love
[48:51] us how much it hurts them you know when
[48:53] we don't call home when we don't call
[48:56] them and talk to them and things after
[48:58] all the things that theyve give for us
[48:59] and sacrificed for us and all all the
[49:02] love that they' given for us they just
[49:04] want
[49:05] us they just want their
[49:07] children you think uh brother Brandon
[49:10] would use that example he said he he
[49:11] watched that Ten Commandments movie and
[49:13] it came to that place I went back and
[49:15] and scrolled through that scene the
[49:16] other night and I was watching it
[49:19] where Pharaoh's daughter in the movie
[49:21] they she her name was Bia she come in
[49:24] there to warn Moses real m Mama that
[49:27] Moses was going to come to see her and
[49:29] and then and and they're having that
[49:31] conversation don't tell Moses who your
[49:34] real mama is and beia was say and I give
[49:37] him wealth and Splendor you couldn't
[49:40] have G him nothing but the Slime Pit and
[49:43] Moses real mama says but I give him
[49:46] life I give him life that's what makes
[49:50] the difference I give him life and now
[49:54] Mama could BR give you Natural Life
[49:57] but God give us eternal life and I thank
[50:01] God this morning that because he rose on
[50:03] the third day that frames everything
[50:05] different we can look at the whole scene
[50:07] different because of life because God
[50:10] give us life thank God for life this
[50:12] morning thank God for the resurrection
[50:14] that he rose again on the third day
[50:17] because he rose from the dead it places
[50:19] us with the gospel armor at the
[50:21] Battlefront to take the place to fight
[50:23] because he rose from the dead it frames
[50:25] everything different we don't don't look
[50:27] at things with like uh depression and
[50:29] look look at things with misery anymore
[50:32] we don't look at Mama sitting there in
[50:34] her wheelchair or sitting there in the
[50:35] nursing home the same way that we do
[50:37] anymore because he rose from the grave
[50:40] on the third day it makes everything
[50:42] different because he lives I can look at
[50:44] everything differently the resurrection
[50:47] is the greatest of all the promises and
[50:49] the things of the scripture it's what
[50:51] everything is based on that Christ Rose
[50:53] from the grave and it it gives us a hope
[50:56] that mama with her gray hair and Mama
[50:58] sitting there in the maybe in a state of
[51:00] misery and things it ain't going to be
[51:02] like that forever it ain't going to be
[51:04] like that it promises brother would say
[51:06] it promises the great Union of our
[51:08] uniting together again it promises in
[51:11] the fading away of all sin it promises
[51:13] the fading away of all deformity the way
[51:17] they Place mother today as a pot of
[51:19] flour sitting by an old lady who was old
[51:22] and can't get up maybe and feeble and
[51:24] gray-headed and wrinkled as sitting in
[51:26] an armchair you know you go at maybe in
[51:29] the nursing home or maybe home where
[51:31] Mama's sitting there and she ain't like
[51:33] she used to be maybe maybe even this
[51:35] morning your mama's in the grave and you
[51:38] all you've got is memories of how she
[51:40] used to be but I thank God this morning
[51:42] that we've got that Resurrection promise
[51:44] it ain't going to stay like that
[51:46] forever someday these old
[51:50] weaken feeed grayheadedgamer
[51:57] someday that body down in the grave that
[52:00] laying there in the grave is going to
[52:01] come up and it ain't going to be like
[52:03] that forever and not only will mother
[52:05] sit there by herself but all of her
[52:08] family with
[52:09] her what a day that will be what a time
[52:13] it will be when we look upon the faces
[52:15] of those we have loved so well what a
[52:17] difference on that morning when we shall
[52:19] see our loved ones and watch what
[52:22] they'll be oh you see what a promise
[52:25] that resurrection power is is to know
[52:28] that one day everything is going to be
[52:30] changed everything all these heartaches
[52:32] and all the things of this life
[52:34] everything one day everything is going
[52:35] to be set in order and you'll see God as
[52:38] you really should see him you should
[52:40] you'll be able to fellowship with him as
[52:42] you really need want to as you really
[52:44] desire in your heart all this old
[52:46] carnality will drop away and you'll be
[52:48] able to really love him the way that you
[52:50] really should it'll now that that was
[52:54] what what were we talking about this
[52:55] morning we're talking about Mother's Day
[52:57] and that's going to be a Mother's Day
[52:59] when Mama and her kitties and all the
[53:02] family and friends are gathered around
[53:04] and everything's patched up the way that
[53:06] God really wants everything to be
[53:08] situated when we see them standing
[53:10] Yonder our loved ones our mothers our
[53:13] kindreds all our friends and to see them
[53:15] in their Immortal bodies their celestial
[53:18] bodies watching their character seeing
[53:20] how they conduct themselves with that
[53:23] sweetness and quietness no more nervous
[53:26] or
[53:27] frustrations to see them in standing in
[53:29] the likeness of the Lord Jesus Oh
[53:32] that'll be a wonderful day you know
[53:35] brother R said it'll take more than a
[53:36] resurrection it'll take an eternity to
[53:39] go around shaking hands and finding out
[53:41] things you think about even even I I was
[53:44] thinking about how many stories that I'm
[53:46] sure I don't even know about here
[53:47] sitting in church because you just you
[53:49] don't have time to talk to people and
[53:52] just in this in this little brief blink
[53:54] of an eye here that we have in life oh
[53:57] but one day we'll have all eternity to
[53:59] go around shaking hands and sit there
[54:02] sit there on the rocking chair porch of
[54:04] Eternity and talk things over that's
[54:07] what I'm talking about this morning
[54:09] things ain't going to look the way that
[54:10] they look now one day you'll see Mama
[54:12] the way that God wants you to wants her
[54:14] to be that's what brother R said he said
[54:16] then we shall see mother as God wants
[54:20] her then we shall see mother as God
[54:22] wants her that'll be a Mother's Day and
[54:25] oh think about this picture
[54:27] though it's wonderful that God can
[54:30] repair and fix up mama so she ain't got
[54:33] gray hair anymore and sit her so she's a
[54:35] young vibrant mother but that a all God
[54:38] wants to do cuz God ain't it ain't the
[54:41] picture ain't complete without you what
[54:44] makes Mama happy is you what makes Mama
[54:47] happy is her family God wants that whole
[54:49] family Circle to be there he said this
[54:52] is what brother Ry said mother would not
[54:54] be complete there without her family and
[54:56] I I hope this Pricks your heart this
[54:57] morning Mama is worthy of honor mama is
[55:00] worthy of respect and look at the life
[55:03] that your Godly Christian mama has lived
[55:05] and think about how oh what what's going
[55:07] to make Mama happy is for you to be with
[55:09] her in glory the picture ain't complete
[55:12] without you what what if this morning
[55:15] what if there's a Lo loose a loose spoke
[55:17] in the wheel what if there's a loose
[55:19] in the chain and that that
[55:21] that weak Link in the chain is you and
[55:24] mama ain't going to be happy with
[55:26] without you you're the part the missing
[55:28] piece well it's time it's time to fix
[55:31] that it's time to run to Christ what
[55:33] makes Mama happy as you that's the
[55:35] happiest time in Mama's life brother R
[55:37] said see her kitties all at home so
[55:40] don't be missing on that day when we sit
[55:44] down with our families and groups across
[55:46] the canopies of Eternity what a they
[55:48] what a day that will be then we'll
[55:53] understand now we're resting on this
[55:55] promise
[55:56] amen and he's the one that promised it
[56:00] in Revelation 1 verse 16 it says out of
[56:04] his mouth with a sharp two-edged
[56:07] sword that sword is not just something
[56:09] to read about but it's something with
[56:10] some power behind it something that's
[56:12] going to do something it's going to do
[56:14] what it says and his countenance was as
[56:17] the sun shinest in his strength now
[56:20] that's same one that that is being spoke
[56:22] of there in Revelations 1:8 says I am he
[56:25] that liveth and was dead and behold I am
[56:29] alive forever more and have the keys of
[56:31] hell and of
[56:33] death we're talking about life this
[56:35] morning and in John 6:39 it says this is
[56:39] the Father's will which hath sent me
[56:41] that of all which he hath given me I
[56:44] should lose nothing but should raise it
[56:46] up again at the last day now there's a
[56:49] promise that we can trust in oh that
[56:52] same one that out of his mouth went his
[56:54] word like a sharp two-edged sword that
[56:56] same one that said I am he that liveth
[56:58] that same one said I ain't going to lose
[57:00] none not one of them everyone that I saw
[57:03] before the foundation of world I'm
[57:05] coming to get them if they're a weak
[57:06] Link in the chain right now if they're
[57:08] broken spoken the wheel I'm coming back
[57:11] to make sure that that Family Circle
[57:13] ain't unbroken oh thank God this morning
[57:15] that he promised that he would lose
[57:17] nothing that means this morning if
[57:19] you're lost if you're lost and undone
[57:20] he's coming for you he's coming after
[57:23] you this morning and maybe you hear that
[57:25] little resonation in your your heart
[57:26] that you know that God's pulling at you
[57:29] maybe oh God is the one that's drawing
[57:32] and when God calls there's only one
[57:33] thing for you to do is to respond to
[57:35] that gospel call it's our mother the
[57:38] word that's calling us it's that it's
[57:40] that God it's that El shedi that's got
[57:42] everything bottled up in him everything
[57:44] that you need if you need something from
[57:45] him this morning turn to him because
[57:48] brother R said there's only one way you
[57:50] can lose that's sit still and don't act
[57:53] on it there's only one way that you can
[57:55] lose it this morning is to not do
[57:57] nothing there's one thing God cannot do
[58:00] he can't fail that's one thing he can't
[58:02] do he cannot fail he has to win every
[58:06] time because he's God he said I'll lose
[58:09] nothing cause no man can pluck them out
[58:11] of my father's hand he said he that
[58:13] heareth my words and believeth on him
[58:14] that sent me has eternal life and shall
[58:17] never come to the Judgment but pass from
[58:19] Death un life he said I'll lose nothing
[58:22] and will raise it up at the last day the
[58:24] musician can go ahead and come forward
[58:25] and we'll close that he said if you're
[58:28] part if you're part of the great family
[58:30] of
[58:32] God I believe this morning he's coming
[58:34] after
[58:35] you if you are that weak L little weak
[58:38] link that has separated this great
[58:40] family reunion at that day May the god
[58:43] of Heaven this morning somehow in a
[58:45] mysterious way unravel those little
[58:48] knots that's tied in your mind and
[58:51] reveal to you the love that he has for
[58:53] you may you come sweetly to ser serve
[58:56] him oh that's the god the kind of God
[58:59] that we have this morning a God who will
[59:01] love us like a mother will like he told
[59:04] I spoke through
[59:05] Isaiah a mother might forget but how
[59:08] could God forget
[59:11] you this morning I pray that these words
[59:13] will resonate in your heart to know that
[59:16] our mother our mothers are worthy of
[59:20] honor C through them came
[59:23] life let's rise to our feet and just
[59:25] worship the Lord you love him this
[59:28] morning
[59:34] amen we're missing a song leader we're
[59:37] missing
[59:42] something well brother R would say he'd
[59:45] say if there was a sinner who's present
