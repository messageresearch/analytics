Joshua 10 Hebrews 1 I just thought there was so much to be covered and we're not counting this in so don't get your numbers mixed up we're not counting this in the series on where we're speaking on on perfect our Perfection but this is an in-shot message to try to explain a few things and uh you know we just put it in anyway so we go to Joshua 10 and Hebrews father we thank you for this day and your grace unto us we thank you for the hour that we have upon the Earth and we pray that you would just bless us now with your presence and understanding that Lord that we may speak what you have to be said unto us that you come Among Us and reveal yourself you said you sent your word and healed us so we believe it tonight that Lord if we just accept what's being said that we can be delivered right where we're sitting not have any problems and and Lord to just walk in you we love you and we thank you bless each one Lord as we come up to this truly a great Thanksgiving time that Lord we are very very thankful for the Newfound way as the prophet said the the the ones who came over were proud to find a new way of religion and Lord we've not found a new way of religion we found the oldest religion that has ever been and we're just rejoicing in that and we're truly having a Thanksgiving in our hearts we love you and we thank you forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord sanctifies in you that we may walk in the light of Your Love in Jesus name they all seem to enjoy these things that we spoke on and you know so you can watch the one especially from Brother Pinkston if you want to pull it up it's not it's on the internet if you're going to watch it man Joshua 10 verse 12. then expect Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the Sabbath and he said in the side of Israel son stand thou still upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of agilon and the sun Stood Still In the moon State until the people had Avenged themselves upon their enemies it's not just written in the Book of Joshua so the son stood still in the midst of Heaven and the hasted not to go down about a whole day and there was no day like that day before it or after it that the Lord hearkened them to the voice of a man for the Lord fought for Israel now we'll go over to Hebrews one everybody knows this one God who at Sunder at times and in diverse manner striking times paste unto the father's by or what are in the prophets now what happened these last days spoken unto us were in or by his son whom he at the pointed there of All Things by whom also he made the world you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now remember the the background a few weeks ago when we were talking about the atonement and uh you know you can go ahead and pull up Exodus 32 there brother Joe and we'll we'll read it and uh because that was where we were dealing with it and uh just looking at the the scriptures and seeing that you know that God the great create part all right the great creator okay now he created all things right right world life and things like that you know letting our visitor back there with us so we always say when you're visiting here you come one time your visitor you come two times you're part of us so we're glad to have you with us tonight amen all right just feel comfortable in the Lord but now God created the world all right but then when he began to um do you know in in the world coming on down through time he started using man amen because you remember there in the scriptures one time the you know they said don't let God Speak said let you go Moses get What God Says bring it to us we'll do it all right and as it was done then see then God would use man to do things and when he would be in the writing of the word he used man in the writing of the word right and that's God's word and and you know he's the one that's that's LED as we we say you know well the Bible is just what a man wrote down well you know that's true a man wrote it down but that man see was led that we read during Hebrews by the Holy Spirit to write the word all right he was led to say what he said right like Isaiah would say a virgin she'll conceive now what probably like the the prophet or people have said you know on his way home maybe he thought you know my Lord what did I say you know I said something in this impossible the Virgin still can see but see it was the word of God all right and the Bible is full of the the things the the nuggets as we look at of doing it and and seeing that it would be those prophets would be led by the spirit of God to speak his word and like I've always told you you know uh we read things in there and we we wonder maybe sometimes how they happen you know but Abraham you know in the slaughter of the Kings and to bring him back into things and he said Lord said to him we'll give you 10 percent well why didn't he say 80 or 90 or 40 or 30 percent or I mean why did he say 10 then we come on over see and we pay our tithes and we we do things like that because we're we're counting that as being what Abraham saw and uh in doing that why didn't he says some other number because he picked up the mind of God right see that would be written in the word the Bible before the world because we read in the Bible there that the you know the lamb stood strain before the foundation of the world so if there is never wish to be a Bible or anything to come down it couldn't be anything different than God had in his mind in the original right right so then it would be ten percent all right and that would be the same for listening brother Stephen Wilson today on him talking about how the um Ella easer went down to get uh Isaac a bride and if you'll remember Ella easer when he got there he was supposed to go down to the kin folks but he was still concerned and everything and when he got down there he said now Lord he said in other words paraphrase in scripture I'm going to sit down here about as well and you let the one that's supposed to be Isaacs right come out here and draw water and said let her give me some water and said didn't let her water the camels right we'll see what was he saying he was speaking the word of God right right because what he was doing was picking up the thought because as those prophets would write the word and the things they would do they would they would pick that thought up you remember we were talking about Moses it's in the seal book there where he said that it was first God's talk he said that it was given to Moses you know what it was Moses thought he said it's not the word yet he said then Moses went out and spoke it he said then it became the word right see and God has used man to write the word by transmitting his thought down through them to where they would pin it out and and the things would happen throughout the whole Bible and it would turn out to be the word of God so then he can say well man said well it's just a man wrote it well that's all right I don't have no problem right but that man was little God right right he would let the Lord to write it and a lot of times he would say thus saith the Lord you know he prophets right well I what did that mean that meant that God was borrowing a voice to speak right the God was using the man transmitting his thought down through him and then he would speak it out and he would say thus saith the Lord in other words the Lord's telling me to say this but if you notice Jesus never did say the same to the Lord because he was the Lord amen what he was speaking was the word of God but those prophets were being led to bring the word of God into being or the Bible as we call it whatever you want to go with it and that they would be doing that it would be God speaking to us personally through those people all right now we read that in Joshua that if the voice of a man the Bible said about verse 14 now at the voice of a man God heard a man say you know Joshua said unto the Lord we read that in verse about 10. Joshua spoke to the Lord and when the Lord speaking to Joshua it was Joshua speaking to the Lord all right now but what we went through now I want you to make sure you get the background of it because the the Bible there says that just that day right after that day it's never been a day that God's used a voice in other words it looks like that's the only time it happened that's what I'm sitting up there on a deer stand I thought well I need to explain that because and let's look a little confusing because you know he says it never before or Never After well that doesn't mean that God never spoke to anybody else he couldn't be referring that because he spoke through Moses right he spoke through all the prophets so it's it has to be referring to that specific pain right you know the never before or Never After was the son standing still right it has to be referring to that because if not then you're going to make the Bible come true because you're going to go over it's Moses is going to speak and you remember there in Exodus 32 where we were we're using it how that Moses said you know if you're going to do anything block my name out right and God should I I won't I won't block her I walked stop them from going but remember they didn't get to go to the promised land right he said I'll deal with them which is you go on with him right now and you go on and head towards the land and I'll deal with them later but the prophet of God said he wondered how that Moses could tell God a better way of doing something uh you know God comes down you're going to kill him Moses stands up throws himself in the breach and when he throws himself into the breach between you know God and man the prophet said God chose Moses you remember I gave you the quote and said God could not go over Moses because he chose him for the job right I wish I could just do what he wouldn't know if God chooses you for a job you're you're going to do the job are you going to face a lot of consequences right you know when Moses did face a lot of things but still he did do it well you remember we were bringing out the scriptures there and how that Moses as he's explaining over later in the scriptures and numbers that let's see you still got an exodus anyhow let's cover that part and then we'll go on you remember the point that we were bringing about in Exodus what was the atonement that Moses made he said pre-adventure I'll go up and I that I may make an atonement what was the atonement that he made it doesn't list any animal there to be sacrificed all right and atonement there's recovery and all can be in many ways you'll find in numbers uh 16 14 16 47. that um God told Aaron the plague was falling and God told Aaron said go among the people take the sensor and make an atonement and it said the pledge were stayed what did Aaron use the sensor but he was using the words of Moses and what happened in Exodus 32. Moses went before God and said if you block them out block me out too the words of a man and God heard him aren't you'll find on over later that when he's saying it in the scripture let's see if I can find that other one I don't want to get all these scriptures in and then we'll try to get back to a point hmm yeah look at uh look at numbers 14 there what we got and look what happened now this is another case that's happening with Moses and this is really the one that brother Branham is using in his references in the scripture but look what he said heart and Moses said I received Thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy as thou Hast forgiven this people from Egypt even until now in other words you've been putting up with them all if you're going down a couple of verses I don't need to use it but if you're going down a couple of verses you'll find said they sin ten times but look what God Said and the Lord said I have pardoned according to Thy Word I have pardoned according to Thy Word the words of a man but now who is that man when he said I have pardoned according to Thy Word I said I don't understand in this you know the scripture for just rolling and I thought well I need to speak on this when I go back home maybe and I spoke out there a few times on it and just jumped about and doing but what about God pardoning according to a man right at the words of a man right guard would pardon what about brother Brown speaking of the grace of marriage and divorce what about the Apostle Paul that gave a Grace of marriage what about Moses that gave a Grace of marriage endure would that not be hardening at the word of a man would that not be a man speaking was not in a man that said going as you are I say report in Corinthians he said the law says this but I say right the words of a man the voice of a man right now if we could believe this is my point that I I want to emphasize to you tonight if we could believe that God used man to write the Bible you know and there's no contradictions in it everybody says there is but I'd like to see one right but at the words of a man could write a book so big as we have it 66 books and you know all the different authors that wrote it and yet not a contradiction in it it would have to be God using those men well truly if we could believe that God would write the word then wouldn't it be I mean should it be hard to believe the words of a man if we believe that man was speaking to us the word of God but there's a choice we have to make right right we can believe that the Apostle Paul taught God's word but see that's the way everybody ought you know everybody they're like this they could be Paul said it Peter said it John said it you know Jesus said it but we don't know about this William Brown we all talk about right well I don't know no problems you don't have to worry about it just don't make fun of it just go on right and believe right what you see my point is if we can believe that God used man to write the word why can't we believe that God used man to bring us to work right amen what should be our problem I know the prophet said it's hard to get one man to believe another man that's true but are we trying to believe the man or are we trying to believe that God is speaking through the man come on Amen now which way it was man in the Bible that I heard his name was Balaam all right false prophet caused Israel to fall all kind of things but you know what what God led him to say is in this Bible but Balaam had to say is in this Bible a false prophet he said I can't say nothing except what God tells me and that's even that the words of a man you're going to tear out that that road and his prophecy of Israel no we can't like to be the word of God because it was the truth now the other things that he brought out wouldn't be the truth and everybody that speaks don't speak true the Bible says that he said people will say things presumptuously that I didn't tell them in other words but what about the words of a man that I gave it to you and make their own the message and and brother random said it like this he said Moses actually said over in the numbers account there and you know one of an exodus he's saying you know about my name but over in numbers he says the people will say read right back up above where we were there in numbers did the people will say that God is able to bring these people out but not able to take them in he just brought him out here where he could destroy him we don't that's an odd statement because you know if God could bring them out of Egypt and would it be a problem for to do the other half and take them in right I mean but that's the way man speaks and that's what Moses said to God said the people will say if you destroy him out here said the people will say mine was able to bring him out he wasn't able to take him in and says you promised it and you know what brother random I gave you the quotes well be glad to give them to you if you want them but he said Moses wrote the word of God back in his face said you said you were going to take him into the land said you promised it Moses was just reminding god of what he said is not that what we're supposed to do if we need salvation according to Romans we believe in her heart and confess with our mouths the Lord Jesus Christ and he'll save us amen repeat it wouldn't be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or Jesus Christ versus the scripture and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that scripture right my stripes we were healed that's scripture if you find a promise in the Bible what's the problem with calling God on the scene to answer that promise right right amen right why did he say it if he didn't mean it well he didn't mean it in that case well now who are you another word's a peanut brain like you and I that's the best way of saying it for all of us compared to the prophets and writers of the word and we take our peanut brain and we say God didn't mean that you see where would they have been back there if they have not believed God spoke to them you know what it in the scripture there it says as I was with Moses speaking to Joshua I'll be with you we know Moses had a burning bush and an experience of saying pull off your shoes unless you're standing on Holy Ground Rick Joshua about one beginning over there and see if Joshua he didn't need a burning bush he met the god of the bush he said are you fires or against us he said I'm not taking sides with nobody he said I'm the captain of the Lord's host take off your shoes he had an experience with God what about you and I we actually had an experience with God to where he's real to us or is he just some kind of a thought or an ideal and then could we come up and say well man wrote this we don't know where to believe it or not well you know that's where not funny but he said well God a man wrote the Bible I said hey you're right I got enough sense to know somebody pinned it right because see a lot of people say no that ain't right God wrote it they only know what you're talking about you see God LED mankind to write this book to bring it into us God LED Martin Luther you're preacher matches you're the judge you'll live by faith a lot of people protested the Catholic Church before Martin Luther came along but none of them had it right in the scriptural line and was called to God for the hour sure he was a trinitarian jury he's sitting a pub and drink beer and smoked a pipe and talked about the Bible again it was God's man that's right amen he was used to God to bring that back unto us John Wesley was used to bring sanctification back into the church extreme the baptism of the Holy Ghost came in jewson Street in 1906. a great prophet in the Bible I mean the prophet of God said the prophet came amen God himself came in those gifts we had people don't want to have nothing to do with gifts but you see it was a word being restored again because even though we talk about the Bible that we read it George said they can't can wear Palmer wearing Locust caterpillar we'd eat it down but he said it'd be restored he said four restoration of Bright Tree and a lot of times sitting right there in Kansas I get up every morning wake get up five o'clock and after I get my dear we I still get up with him and we'd eat breakfast together and pray and and he'd go out and Hunt I'd lay down on the bed and put my iPod in my ears and laid out our sleep and listen and sleep and listen and you know then I get up about 7 30 and I just walk and pray and listen to tapes and just I've listened to the restoration of the broad tree you know where the prophets explain it four messengers of death can't one problem with Locust caterpillar I ate it down he said before massive years of life what Luther Wesley and of course and the end time with the word do you even though we could talk about that man brought us this Bible you know we can say this is God's word but something has to be made personal about it or otherwise it's just words on a page all right that's right amen thank you it's just words on the page if that doesn't come off the page into your heart you see that's why there had to be a time that that had to be restored and the life was the word to be restored to us and then the prophet would stand there and say why would you struggle that squirrels being spoken into existence stormed that things out salvation comes and he said when we believe that under the blood of bulls and goats Moses could speak Flash fleeks and frogs right but see do we believe in the same God come on tell me that God is still speaking amen him and he pardoned Israel at the works of a man right why can't we believe he pardoned through Moses he pardoned to Paul why can't we believe all of it's been a part you know what uh what Martin Luther offered a pardon right Martin Luther offered a pardon for sin but they just shall live by faith right man John Westby offered a pardon sanctification cleansing and setting us aside for service Zeus's Street offered a pardon at the words of a man right you know what happened on the sushi Street you know what the man started there in Kansas we were talking about it the other day we happened to see it on the video and the brother was bringing it back to me you know that um what's his name Seymour Seymour actually started in Kansas and went from Kansas to Texas from Texas to California and uh started to the mission there you know but a pardon was offered those people at the words of a man a man preached that the gifts was there again and they believed it that's right what do you count this message to me come on you know what I counted to be a pardon Amen brother God used a man to bring us a message that's right yeah the message is my pardon amen right man I if I believe God spoke through the man she said he's speaking to me that's why I love that scripture behold I sinned Garrisonville you say that in the Bible the Brandon found it doesn't say that in the Bible the behold I send you Elijah right amen right do you accept to me amen call for me a pardon amen a revealed word amen an opening of the word that I could look at and read and find myself right land within that word at the words of a man that's why I was trying to thinking about that see because they're in Joshua it looks like that God would never use man again if you really read that that way because he would never use the voice of the land so I said before our after Lord that ain't right right but I always use man to speak right right we went back to the message that pre-silver and Moses and then the scriptures begin to un Oh I thought when that one of the numbers there Lord that there's something about that I go back and get my Bible and read it he said at the word to a man I'll pardon you listen folks I told Brother Jim I said I'm not a Trophy Hunter come on I like to do yeah the only pleasure they ever do maybe fish them but you know what I ain't always wrong right 9 seconds Listen to Three tapes while I'm sitting on deer stand I don't see why you couldn't get your knockout stick in your pocket do your work but you see I'm listening because I want to know what the man has to say because I believe that God was using the man to speak right he brought us the word of God I don't believe he stopped speaking when the profit went off the same right right I thought we believe in the file former industry dealers were farther protecting other states right I thought we believe that God was still speaking through the Firefall industry right right yeah and the people if you don't believe that why are you going to jerk I didn't save you a lot of trouble once you stay at home he said well I said be a star cat I didn't sarcastic that's the only God's on his truth if you don't believe that God is speaking through the ministry here in the church why do you come right well you got nothing else to do but why can't we believe God is still sick a divorce of a man who said we could believe the prophet would speak and he would tell us what God had to say all right but if a five-fold Ministry tells you the same thing the prophet said and who's doing the speaking because that was the whole point I've tried to make for three services and this one I'm trying to make my brother Brown said it was Moses it was not Moses he said it was Christ in Moses amen right amen all right my Bible said if the mind of Christ being you my Bible said he's Hebrews 13 8. amen and that's what I was trying to express while ago about it that when Abraham picked that thought up see and spoken Moses picked that thought up do we think Moses was just walking around he said Aaron okay let's get some flies get some please what's wrong now he picked up the thought of God right you're right and Joshua seen the battle if you remember reading the scriptures they had kind of busted him up and they were scattered but he knew if they got back together that that created a lot of problems he picked up the dog of what was needed what was needed some stand still where did he get that thought oh okay it was not that the mind of Christ amen speaking through Joshua come on you say yeah but but brother Dale the images should be put on the man that done the speaking no you got to put the instance on the one that's doing the speaking through the man right then it's the words of a man right because what if Joshua hadn't said it right it never happened it wouldn't have took place yeah that's right there's the point see if Moses hadn't said it he could sit back over the side and said Lord I tell you now don't don't do that no more no no no he had to get up and say it when he got up spoke it then that was Christ God has always been Christ in all the men that spoke it it was Christ and around him that told us the grace of marriage and divorce he was not William Bradham right it was God speaking through the voice of a man one says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the defend the days of the man this way you can't separate the man in the voice well that's true but man can say things that's not right but God can't remember I gave you the quote there when I was reading it before that brother Brown said if God promised it God is obligated to keep his word amen so this is not Independence upon William Brown a man he's not built on the fifo ministry of Samuel Dale and and whoever would be in that Ministry it's whether or not it's not whether God's been using them to speak because the Bible says they speak presumptuously and they'll say the Lord told me even though these preachers say Hello Lord told me you ever notice the way I say it a lot of time that something told me right if it don't come to pass I got enough sense to know it would not right that's right but if it comes to price I got enough sense to know it wouldn't mean right all right Choice the voice of a man this is in you sisters and and you laughed him right to take them down to your children and to teach those children and and you know the younger the older the younger and I like that because you become the voice of God a dumb donkey told a prophet one day they expected to get killed if he didn't cut it out right right thank you all right it's divorce that we're talking about right the force of a man the man that's speaking is the Lord himself if those prophets could say thus saith the Lord that God could use them you notice right around him when he comes down to Sister Hattie right where he spoke to her about her children I believe I'm pretty sure that's one then he said you know she said unto him said that ain't nothing but the truth he said you say whatever you have need of and it'll be given unto you right amen right I say unto you go check that and I'm pretty sure that's one he seems she didn't catch it he said sister that is the saith the Lord why because she's been used to that she knew when he said thus saith the Lord it'll be right do you see in his divorce of a man the whole Bible is made by the voice of a man right the living Bible that we would call it like Luther the voice of a man or the message of the Jewish you'll live by faith Wesley Street the voice of a man the Firefall Ministry the laity the people it's in all of the Bride because it's the same voice right right when are we going to believe that amen what about brother Dale how would that contradiction Million Lives too well if I'm a liar don't worry about it I'm a liar you catch me off to work come show me come and tell me that's not right we're down in a certain place one time this big brother was there you know and he said we'll talk a little bit about this brother calling them would start to go sorry and uh he remembers it and the man said now if anything goes wrong said this in your own agrees and raise your hand well he quoted something amen that's raised my hand he said why did Brother that watch your brother didn't say that yes he did he you didn't say that brother I said here's what he said I'm running across like that this other brother was sitting there with him it was his partner you know he said he called his name and he said but then it was right another round didn't say that he said well I'll say it's my own quote I said continue this is your quote but you said brother Brown said that's right why when are we going to be to the place let's run around and said that we would look people in the eye so you're not saying what the prophet said well come and tell me if I'm not saying what the prophets say and don't worry about it if you're right then I don't have any trouble coming up here and telling me Georgia straighten me out because I thank God might get straight down I'm wrong I want to be right right but they gonna gain me a bit to be wrong I'm going to lose everything but if I can be right then it'd be all right words of a man you know today we're based on the words of a man right work to a man Webster real predictionary everything we do is based upon what somebody said done you know Etc made might have finished the words of a man what about Mark 11 . we talk about that one verse said if you say unto this mountain be moved right and doubt not in your heart that's it you got two or three quotes laying up here and again to brother Joe if you'd like to see him my brother and said it's not what he said this is what you say Amen and I hope now that you're getting the state getting it in the right place it was Christ in Moses amen that could contact God and actually not straighten him out no not tell him a better way to do it that's just the terminology but could remind him of what he's saying right that's the only way he he didn't straighten God out Hallelujah he just reminded god of what he said all right you ever noticed over in the I think it's about Genesis I can't remember but you'll remember where it said it it's in Genesis where he said it it repented the Lord that he made man right amen now can't you just see that oh Lord I'm sorry who are you talking to that's right you know I didn't think it was what won right who was he repenting to right huh you don't ever read scripture and think like that who's he repenting to right so there's any it repented God what God turned repent me to turn around God turned around from what he was spending their fixing to do he was going to wipe out every one of them he said Noah you make a boat get them in the boat he had plans to screw them all he had plans right there with Israel in Exodus 32 to kill every one of them he done told Moses step aside I'll kill them all and take you and make a nation out of you and he could have done it right right right but that wouldn't the way it's going to be that's right because there was more to the story amen they had to be people to come in the end time could realize what it means to speak the word right not if you say unto this mountain I mean not if I say under the mountain anybody knows God can move around right right but if you say right and doubt not in your heart come put it together with the rest of the scriptures that's it and what does it say I thought the Bible said there said it's not you that's asking it's the father in you that doeth the speaking you want to go straight here it's not you well brother Dale if it's not me then it's not the words of a man that's where you messed it up at because that's what you're looking at God allowed man to speak his word you agree all right well what would be the problem of him today allowing it to be spoken right what's the trouble what's your problem today with with Allowing God to come on the scene and speak through you see it right there I advert I prophecy yeah I believe he speak to brother Brown I believe you can speak through Moses but see that's what the people was back there with Jesus I said We Believe monsters oh yeah we believe everything Moses said Moses spoke of me he said all right and what Jesus said that scripture Jesus said Moses spoke a man that's right me we're Abraham's children he said before Abraham would I am right that's right in other words I spoke to Abraham right when are we going to get down to believing that God can still speak but you know what I told her when I first came into the message because everybody in the message deals with Mark 11 or has been coming down and when they talk about one of these days I said if you don't get the words you can't speak it that's right you know what I mean by that you know that probably Martin Luther don't tell them how many times he read that scripture of the just shall live by faith right he probably preached Sherman's discourses I'll talk classes no telling you but one day it opened up that's right it became alive how many times did we read the Bible I don't see brother George Canada today and I think he's still in my music I believe he said 16 times he read the Bible or something like he told me a number that he read the Bible all right but you see we can read it like I lost my glasses in the airport and I had to borrow him out there every time you know from somebody that's right you get weights you put them on here you ready to get them they got there and he goes yeah I can read it without it let's see if we can read with somebody else's glasses how many times I'm not asking for a raise of hands but how many times did you read the Bible and before you heard this message it was a trinitarian believe in three gods and could read it right out of the book right how many times did you read Acts 2 38 verse says repent everyone be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I remember brother Tatum used to say well the Tatum said he knew there's something wrong there and said when he'd be reading the Bible he'd get over there Acts 2 38 said he'd speed up you know because of you there's something burning causing a problem but how many times did we read the book and what was our thoughts when read it but then when we came into this message and God begins to open the word it became a brand new book right right didn't change the letters on the page well see that's what I was trying to tell the people I said you got to get the word for you can speak it Martin Luther read the judge you live by faith many times but one day he got this picture he got the word and he went out to smoke it you know what it created a Revival around the world is opened unto him and he saw the just shall live by faith what about it at the words of a man our whole life depends upon the fact was you there when Jesus was here on the shores of Galilee no can you prove he existed well they got directly to the other day oh yeah okay yeah they make records anything you want was you there when running around to smoke squirrels into existence you don't know where he did or not you know the only way you'll ever know whether he did or not is not for you to speak them unless we need them but for that same God to speak to you about what you have needed brother Branham said Abraham offered up Isaac right he said now it's nowhere in the Bible for anybody else to do that it was a one-time to Abraham did something personal he picked up that thought from God he was transmitted right down into his life as this message got off the pages into her heart um or is it still just quotes that's why there's so much argument about it arguing over what brother Reynolds said oh I can give you a 100 quotes for that but what about the ones that the other side uses like I heard brother I believe it was brother Maloney told me one time he read this man one man talking about uh saved by faith and he said I read it said boy man I thought it ain't no way in the world nobody else could disprove that and he said then there was another fellow wrote a book you saved my works and he said I got through reading that I didn't know which one was right he's just honest what about it the words of our voice of a man in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery of God will be revealed do we believe that God has spoken unto us do we believe that spoken word books and things I don't have one to hold up here that's close that's her name I ain't even wrote off of it do we believe that to be the words of a man or do we read it as God's speaking through us you know to us through the man for him to say it is one thing that's why I've always told you that the way I check a Doctrine is by my new birth because there's no way I'll check about folks brother that was it how many more you want conversation give me any quote like probably by memory almost gave you the book it's him to tell you how much what the prophet seemed like he said something else what about it we'll go with the Bible we're reading the Bible where it says baptize the name of the father and the son and all the others then we turn over a few pages and we read and said and we baptize the name Jesus Christ what about you if this message just become an argument something that we cannot argue people and we love to talk to other people you know because we cannot argue them but you don't have the the information we have courage to become a crashed but around October Charlie Cox said brother Charlie said the same voice that spoke one day and told you to turn around in other words your salvation he said that same voice will speak one day and call you up and we heard the voice of God or have we heard just the voice of a man is this message just arguments over what a man had to say where is it the revelation of Jesus Christ you're his voice we're running on perfect Faith said he was pleased to use Jesus's voice because he lived within him and he said if he lived in you he's pleased to use your voice he said when a Believer takes up on his heart the word of God believe that word and speaks it he said it's deity speaking but you see then everybody will get to the bases like one brother has it he said everything I say is the Lord I said there's something wrong with you God improved it it'd be nice to come along and be able to do like that wouldn't it I'm listening to a date yesterday to learn the woods hunting and listen to it and they run around and said you know how a baby gets what it wants he said it cries he said it cries it ain't got a better way in the world to figure out how to get it work and do it did he just cries he said you want something from God he said just keep crying now this is the words he said he said he loves to hear his children cry well not brother I got all these other quotes over here where I'm supposed to speak the word this just get it speak it we better do a lot of crying first is the only way we can speak his word is do a lot of crime till he gives it to us there ain't never a prayer that I prayer that I ever pray and I don't conclude one time Lord open your word Reveal Your Word because we got a hand who we got it excuse me can I say we had it come on we had it didn't we didn't we have the Bible we've had it all along but we didn't have it understood correctly that's it so now which one do you want well we understand one God do we understand one God we have we understand one God we we've got it all down do we understand one God laughs do we know that they're not the one voice of God there's thousands of Little Voices yes but they better all be saying What God Says now I got to explain that because I don't at least a loop all right we'll never around the world never get to the place that we're all saying cat and everybody around the world says cat dog or whatever you know better than that because I never have believed that we all get the same Revelation as the part of what we're getting we get to Revelation one God but there's many other there's many people who can bring and help you with that as understanding of what God has spoken to them about one God if you'll listen to them that's right people call just a big book there's a lot in it but it's all the voice of God when I'm listening to brother Brown that man is speaking to me your word to whatever my thoughts or opinions are no good like I told you sitting in the Ministries meeting one time with a bunch of preachers I laid down the criteria you the big old words you use there you know something I laid down a thing I said run around was the prophet he's the one that had domestic and you're not wrong it don't matter what we think they all agree amen about 20 something low 30 something of them I read one quote from Brother Branham and they spent an hour and a half and we never did get onto the topic they spent an hour and a half talking about well what's wrong this wasn't that way I just didn't say no more I read one quote word that right around said the bride goes up in Revelation 4 1 and not seen on 1921 and I happened to read them the one I believe is off the Feast of the trumpet Robertson that's thus saith the Lord your destiny administers running quotes and doing things well the Book of Revelation order this is I'm gonna call his name brother with women he said brother Dale I've never seen you down and out in your face I said brother when you go down the factory saying that brother random was a prophet and what he said was right and everybody else spends an hour and a half trying to tear it apart no wonder I'm down now because I thought everybody would agree that brother Randall was the prophet and he was he was the one that brought the magic right but see they were trying to straighten him out but you know one of those men today ever come back and said I was wrong brother Dale he won't do it because they never seen what I'm talking about if brother Brown says the bride goes up in Revelation 4 1 and 19 of 1921 that's thus saith the Lord he said then where are you and I that could argue about that what about Revelation 10 7 so what Prophet said it's not there well Revelation 18 4 come out I hurt my people what about it he said that's all to Israel this message folks will be what will go to Israel but not brother Brown that's right amen right it'll be through two prophets right do we believe the word or do we believe man he said what are those blue man it's the man speaks according to the word of God yes but if he doesn't he speaks presumptuous that's my brother just now got to sending me a letter about something that broke my heart to read he said please help me show us no can't send him back anything heavy he said he listens to tape so when these days I'll cover it when I cover it I pray God will allow him to hear that message right because I'm not going to get on the internet and argue with nobody you know what that does right they're just sitting out there waiting on you to do something like that and I'm not going to do it because this makes you not made already I have a little topic my last message didn't get through with it so you said what's the difference in perfect and perfection my run says you got a question and you already said it's God will put somebody on the pulpit right that's a quote but the joke came out in the office and handed me a piece of paper he said I wrote this down a couple of weeks ago you wrote what's the difference in perfect imperfection if you've got to talk to your mind something God put somebody out there little answer that no one because we believe in a living God that's right amen and I stood here and told you that my son would come back to the Lord you think that was me or was it the Lord you make your choice don't you think I'd like to say that about everybody but when he came back and also told my wife that he'd be preaching beside him was that me or was that the Lord how long could we stay here and bring out things and see if it was God or was it man what are you trying to build yourself no trying to build God because they gonna do you a bit of good to build upon me right that's right I never actually defied me like he did when I started preaching on perfection but he ain't going to stop me from bringing it blessed thank you Lord he's done everything he could close but you can't because I believe what God gives me is for him it's his responsibility to take care of it that's right what about it are we looking at a man or are we looking at God come on folks if you can't understand it God used Balaam he used to dumb donkey using a rooster it's about like that Feller said he climbed up in a tree Story Goes man walks under him and he said John you'd be looking at her words start to walk off he said John I had a while he said you're called to preach he said God's been preaching 40 years he said can I tell him that was me you know I ended up in my tree well you know what might have been the voice of God that's right all right might have just been divorce of God come on musician think about it all of the scriptures tied us together to see the voice of God when he uses man you know what I want to use your sister is that in the Bible right come on it's not just something that you don't mind you know a little monkey he uses his people he used his people to bring the word now listen as we finish then is there any problem with seeing that he's using people to make the word alive there's any trouble with that accused man to bring it people to bring it now he's using people to make it alive because that's what he's done in every age he's always had somebody to make the word alive why can't we believe we're part of it the voice of a man the son could stand still you know the story it went with the rest of that at the voice of a man the sons Stood Still the prophet said son s-o-n he said he stood still he said when a little woman needed he said he stood still the son you and I need him he'll stand still if we just listen that's right we might have to wait a little while so what as I said we may have to cry a little bit what's wrong with crying I'm blessed God I ain't gonna cry I'll just speak the word would you mind out to cry before you received too I was in the crimes when you get what you need to speak I hope you follow that point it's not if I say but if you say because it's not you speaking it's the father in you he's doing the speaking time back on these times okay 369 the red one all in here the Mighty God is Jesus Mighty God might be moving forward oh what about him he can't break it wrong it works and that's it preacher said you'll be I will say that what's up guys that's mine and what he's saying it now with your own bro I can't explain this song give me my problems but the problem was supposed to make us greater Christian far I'm probably right my way say Lord when I have the uh for him I thought we were joking I thought we were the children of God I know we 've got children so young the end of all things coming days walking unto us in history on you well what about the Bible what about The Landings you can't talk together oh man we got good foreign Thanksgiving Day great Thanksgiving foreign and I believe it see that's
