[15:46] all right but uh we just certainly
[15:47] thankful to be here yeah you know we
[15:50] might not have planned it but God
[15:51] certainly had it in his mind you're here
[15:53] because God put you here and he wanted
[15:55] you to be here this afternoon anyway we
[15:58] just thank God for that amen amen
[16:00] we're just gonna I'm just gonna take a
[16:02] little thought this afternoon and um
[16:04] um try to go through quickly maybe show
[16:07] a little bit of a uh just a few pictures
[16:09] of our missionary trip last year when we
[16:12] went to the Philippines so um I don't
[16:14] want to keep you all standing so let's
[16:15] go to the scriptures uh this afternoon
[16:17] to Colossians chapter 3
[16:19] Colossians chapter 3 starting at verse
[16:21] one
[16:25] now they were mentioning this morning in
[16:27] in Sunday school a little a little
[16:29] thought about
[16:30] uh Living Dead and zombies and stuff and
[16:33] uh for the Way Broadway didn't know I
[16:36] had already preached the message about
[16:37] that before okay and so uh uh I just
[16:41] felt led to just go that that direction
[16:44] this afternoon so
[16:46] um uh just kind of type you know about
[16:49] how the world you know uh the the things
[16:52] that the world does you know they they
[16:54] do it for a purpose
[16:56] and you can almost type everything what
[16:58] they do with with spiritual you see so
[17:01] um let's just look at this this
[17:02] afternoon amen praise God Colossians
[17:05] chapter 3 start in verse one it says if
[17:07] ye then be risen with Christ seek those
[17:09] things which are above where Christ
[17:11] sitteth on the right hand of God
[17:13] set your affection on things above not
[17:15] on things on the earth for ye are dead
[17:18] and your life is hid with Christ in God
[17:21] right now it's interesting how Paul here
[17:23] talks about he's talking about life
[17:26] but yet he's talking about death at the
[17:28] same time right you see amen verse 4
[17:31] when Christ who is our life shall appear
[17:34] amen then shall he also appear with him
[17:36] in glory mortified Therefore your
[17:38] members which are upon the Earth
[17:39] fornication and cleanliness inordinate
[17:42] affection evil concupiscence and
[17:44] covetousness which is idolatry for which
[17:47] things seek the wrath of God cometh on
[17:49] the children of disobedience in verse 7
[17:52] into which he also walks sometime when
[17:55] ye lived in them praise God Amen let's
[17:57] just buy our heads precious Lord we
[17:59] thank you once again for your
[18:01] opportunity that you've given us to be
[18:03] in the house of God lord to worship you
[18:05] in spirit and in truth Lord and to Feast
[18:07] upon your word I pray that you'd open
[18:08] our ears of our understanding Lord let
[18:11] us father God receive something from you
[18:14] not from a man but Lord God let your
[18:15] Holy Spirit just come down amongst us
[18:17] let us leave here different than what we
[18:20] came in Father God pray that you'd use
[18:22] uh these frail lips Lord God and Lord
[18:25] may you be the the spokesperson this
[18:27] afternoon Lord we had Commit This Time
[18:29] into your hands now in the name of the
[18:31] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen okay
[18:34] so you may be seeing it tonight
[18:38] just working okay
[18:49] I like to certainly put a put a smile on
[18:52] your face
[18:54] hey man
[18:56] if you're here behind here preaching you
[18:58] know if you're all nervous you'll take
[19:00] that nervous
[19:01] that's nervousness
[19:03] amen praise God but you know you should
[19:06] be nervous whenever you're speaking to
[19:07] the bride of Christ right man praise the
[19:09] Lord so
[19:11] amen so this afternoon I just want to
[19:13] take this little thought Living Dead
[19:15] amen
[19:16] Living Dead I was going to call it the
[19:18] living dead but that might sound a
[19:20] little bit too impressive
[19:22] amen but you know in this on on Earth
[19:25] right now as though as the world as
[19:28] they're showing all these zombie movies
[19:30] and it seems like zombies were dead for
[19:32] a while and now they seem to be
[19:33] resurrected backed up again Hollywood
[19:36] seems to be resurrecting them backed up
[19:38] with shows uh the Living Dead and all
[19:40] these kinds of uh things but you know
[19:43] what they're presenting only what's in
[19:45] them you see right there's death that's
[19:47] working in them they're picking up
[19:48] images and things from the fourth
[19:50] dimension right bringing them on right
[19:52] and all they can do is just uh portray
[19:55] what they really are right see Hollywood
[19:58] is nothing but death you see that's all
[20:00] right
[20:01] there's nothing you know if you enjoy
[20:04] Hollywood yeah come on hey man it speaks
[20:07] about what's going on inside your life
[20:09] but Hollywood is nothing but portraying
[20:11] that so that's that's if they're dead
[20:14] they're gonna portray zombies they're
[20:15] gonna portray demons and all kinds of
[20:17] stuff like that now if you if you look
[20:20] here what Paul said here in verse one
[20:22] that if he be if he then be risen with
[20:24] Christ amen now but Paul is saying here
[20:27] is that at some point in time you were
[20:29] dead right exactly you see at some point
[20:32] in time you were dead
[20:33] and but until Christ came on the scene
[20:36] amen then you were living right I was
[20:38] dead in sin and trespasses as the Bible
[20:40] said you were too amen you see when I
[20:43] was out in the world doing the things of
[20:44] the world I was dead right I was living
[20:46] but yeah I was dead as the scripture
[20:48] says amen but now you are risen with
[20:51] Christ amen so we know there's no Death
[20:53] Around Christ right there's no death
[20:55] within him outside that God is life amen
[20:57] amen so you're gonna have to portray
[20:59] life amen praise God if you're risen
[21:01] with Christ Jesus that's right now
[21:03] Ephesians 2 1 tells us and you have he
[21:06] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[21:09] and sins right man I mean it used to be
[21:11] dead yeah I used to be better that's why
[21:15] I always say I always thank God for his
[21:16] mercy and Grace Amen in all his mercy
[21:19] and Grace I would be where I am now amen
[21:21] right and you wouldn't be where you are
[21:23] now yeah praise God and I will never
[21:26] stop thanking him for his mercy and
[21:27] Grace amen now verse 2 tells us and
[21:30] there in Colossians chapter 3 continue
[21:32] reading
[21:33] well let's go back to verse one it says
[21:35] if ye then be risen with Christ seek
[21:37] those things which are above right amen
[21:39] where Christ sitted on the right hand of
[21:42] God right
[21:44] all right set your affection on things
[21:46] above all right what is it what is he
[21:49] talking about in other words set what's
[21:51] more important the things down here
[21:53] below are the things that are above you
[21:55] see whatever you love whatever you
[21:57] desire amen that's your affection you
[21:59] see you have an affection I have an
[22:01] affection for my wife right you see
[22:02] that's right and whatever you love
[22:05] that's what you desire right see so he's
[22:07] telling us Paul's telling here set your
[22:09] affection on things above not on things
[22:11] of the earth why because the things of
[22:13] the earth they're gonna perish amen
[22:15] Heaven's a nurse shall pass away but my
[22:18] word shall never pass away amen of the
[22:21] Christian desires to be more like Christ
[22:22] a Christian desires to feed on the word
[22:25] a Christian desires Amen to just grow up
[22:28] more in Christ amen looking up because
[22:31] our Redemption is drawn nice see but if
[22:33] you're constantly looking and watching
[22:35] zombie movies and constantly playing
[22:36] these zombie video games and constantly
[22:38] doing all these things you're looking
[22:40] down and you're not looking about it
[22:42] that's not going to help you getting a
[22:43] rap amen
[22:46] you see there's certain things that a
[22:48] Christian feeds upon right amen a
[22:51] Christian has a diet right the world has
[22:53] a doctor a patient has a doctor and it's
[22:55] not the same diet
[22:57] amen right bro now let's continue
[22:59] reading here in Colossians just kind of
[23:01] breaking these down verse two set your
[23:04] affection on things above not on things
[23:05] on the earth for ye are dead yep right
[23:08] amen and your life is hid with Christ in
[23:11] God Amen your life should be so hidden
[23:14] Christ that Satan won't even know where
[23:16] you're at right that's how head you
[23:19] should be in Christ right amen praise
[23:21] God whenever whenever you step foot
[23:23] every morning you get up amen Satan
[23:26] should be shivering amen right this he's
[23:30] gonna wake up again yeah yeah she's
[23:33] gonna wake up again she's gonna ruin my
[23:35] my ministry right yeah yeah right right
[23:38] that's it see Satan Satan watches each
[23:41] and every one of us and we can give
[23:43] Satan a hard time amen Jesus did and the
[23:46] only thing that he used was the word
[23:48] amen amen and he used none of his own
[23:50] tactics nothing nothing of the flesh
[23:52] that means the word back to the word
[23:53] amen that's what a Christian wants right
[23:56] that's the only way we can defeat Satan
[23:58] right amen verse 4 when Christ is our
[24:02] life shall appear then shall ye also
[24:04] appear with him in the Lord verse 5
[24:06] mortified Therefore your members which
[24:08] are upon the Earth right amen and it
[24:10] lists all these different things in
[24:11] order to fiction evil concupiscence
[24:14] which are evil thoughts King
[24:15] covetousness which is idolatry amen so
[24:18] these are things amen that a Christian
[24:20] should be dead to amen amen you see a
[24:24] Christian is really the Living Dead yeah
[24:27] because we should be living dead right
[24:30] amen you see what I'm saying you see the
[24:33] world what is what is taken they're
[24:34] showing us the zombies resurrecting and
[24:36] what Satan is trying to do is he's
[24:37] perverted
[24:40] what he's doing is uh for example I I
[24:43] was in 80s and 90s kid and I grew up
[24:45] with Michael Jackson and all that stuff
[24:47] yeah now how many everyone remember
[24:48] Thriller yeah yeah
[24:51] Thriller if you ever saw the video what
[24:53] Thriller was is that all these zombies
[24:55] got up out of the grave and they started
[24:58] just dancing there in the Middle Street
[24:59] with Michael Jackson and everything I'm
[25:02] doing all these different dances and
[25:03] stuff but you see all it has is just a
[25:07] perversion of what happened in the upper
[25:08] room that's right right because when
[25:11] Christ when Christ uh resurrected he
[25:14] didn't come to bite people's heads off
[25:15] or nothing like that he came to give the
[25:17] Holy Ghost which is life he breathed on
[25:20] them to give him the Holy Ghost and then
[25:22] when they went back to the upper room
[25:24] they had a little dance themselves as
[25:25] well a little dance in the spirit right
[25:28] amen all right man and so all of Satan
[25:30] is is trying to pervert all that amen
[25:32] and bringing it bringing it down and
[25:34] people identify with those things and
[25:36] the more you identify with the more
[25:38] you're dying right I see right the more
[25:40] you're done right amen now
[25:44] as we said you know each and every one
[25:46] of us we're walking dead amen before
[25:48] Christ came and touched your life yeah
[25:49] right each and every one of us have
[25:52] walked dead and you know we can bring in
[25:55] we can bring it down home no
[25:58] just because you've been in the message
[26:00] 20 30 40 years don't mean that you can't
[26:02] be walking around dead right right 30 40
[26:06] years in the message don't mean anything
[26:07] to God that's right amen amen amen is it
[26:10] the message is in you all right the
[26:12] message isn't you then you'll be living
[26:14] amen all right some of us come to church
[26:16] dragging our feet you know what brother
[26:19] Dale's gonna preach tonight yeah
[26:21] yeah all right let's see what brother
[26:23] dick is gonna watch songs he's gonna be
[26:25] singing yeah let's see what uh what
[26:27] they're gonna give me you know it's
[26:30] almost like people come to church with
[26:31] some of them some of them come to church
[26:33] with with bibs on yeah yeah and then
[26:36] there's some that come with aprons on
[26:38] you know yeah
[26:40] and then the ones that come with bibs on
[26:42] are the ones usually that kind of sit
[26:44] back there in the corner and just kind
[26:46] of let's say give me give him yeah all
[26:48] right kind of getting dirty kind of
[26:50] getting you know just kind of letting
[26:51] drip off you know and but the ones that
[26:54] are that they're ready to come you know
[26:56] not just to be served but to serve amen
[26:58] they got their ready they're ready to
[27:00] serve amen ready to work right amen
[27:03] praise God
[27:06] now
[27:07] as I said you know the world's been
[27:09] repopulated they were popularized
[27:11] zombies amen through Hollywood and art
[27:13] and we see it all all the time man
[27:15] everywhere we're seeing uh the zombies
[27:17] are coming back to life all right amen
[27:20] and you know what a zombie it doesn't it
[27:22] doesn't care what what uh uh uh doesn't
[27:24] care uh where it goes you know it just
[27:27] walks and you can kind of push it this
[27:28] way and then it goes this way you know
[27:30] and they're ready to they got this evil
[27:33] evil thing too they're ready to bite
[27:34] your head off if you're not careful you
[27:36] know and I actually looked up the word
[27:39] zombie in the dictionary and uh here's
[27:42] what the word zombie means the body of a
[27:44] dead person given the semblance of Life
[27:48] all right but mute and Willis by
[27:53] Supernatural Force yeah usually for some
[27:57] evil purpose right see it's a person
[28:00] it's a it's a it's a being that's
[28:02] walking living you see
[28:04] but they're living a perverted life
[28:07] right they're walking dead right you see
[28:10] they're The Walking Dead it's a person
[28:12] whose Behavior or responses are wooden
[28:15] listless or seemingly roped in other
[28:18] words there's an automation going on
[28:20] there yeah
[28:22] so I hope none of us none of us are
[28:25] seemingly wooden right
[28:27] you see you see because it's very easy
[28:31] as Christians to take everything as a
[28:33] routine that's right oh yeah and we get
[28:35] so comfortable with the routine and if
[28:37] it doesn't happen like this then I'm
[28:40] completely uh I go overboard you see
[28:42] it's a routine don't get me wrong
[28:43] there's got to be order you see her
[28:45] absolutely but God look what happened to
[28:48] Gideon in the Bible he was he was stuck
[28:51] in a routine in his life until God
[28:53] completely changing and said look you're
[28:55] a man you're you're a man uh uh uh uh um
[28:58] what is it I need I need you right I'm
[29:02] Gonna Get You Out of My out of your
[29:04] comfort zone because I gotta use you you
[29:06] see right and that's that's how God
[29:08] always does you see God doesn't want us
[29:10] to always be stuck in the routine
[29:12] because we get comfortable in the
[29:14] routine then we forget right what what
[29:17] else doctors do around us
[29:19] routine and I actually heard the other
[29:21] day brother Brown kind of paraphrasing I
[29:23] was listening brother Brandon said
[29:24] routines can be detrimental to a
[29:27] Christian
[29:28] if you're not careful wherever right
[29:30] right so you have to you there's got to
[29:32] be orders right right but if you're not
[29:34] careful because God sometimes gets us
[29:36] out of our comfort zone all right buddy
[29:39] that's what he specializes amen praise
[29:42] God you don't want us to be in zombie
[29:44] mode
[29:46] coming in here with zombie mode you see
[29:48] brother Dale can't help you if you're
[29:50] coming in here in zombie mode you see
[29:53] where the weight can't help you to come
[29:54] in here and zombie mod amen the whole
[29:56] that we can we can easily quench the
[29:58] spirit if we come again zombies
[30:00] they're ready to pull on the word you're
[30:02] right what what God feed me feed my soul
[30:05] I'm here to hear more of you amen praise
[30:08] God I'm here to receive from you
[30:10] from you man amen praise God
[30:14] now
[30:15] as we see as we were talking about Satan
[30:18] what he's trying to do with these
[30:19] zombies is he's just trying to pervert
[30:20] show a perversion of life and
[30:22] Resurrection right and man what Satan is
[30:24] doing is he's actually laughing at the
[30:26] world as he's showing them on a TV
[30:28] screen you see there there
[30:32] uh yeah and the TV screen showing them
[30:35] who they really are and they can't seem
[30:36] to pick it up right that's that's them
[30:38] you see
[30:40] and and uh uh um it's almost like what
[30:43] Revelations 3 tells us if in Revelation
[30:45] 3 when he was talking about in the The
[30:46] Churchill to see him he says because
[30:48] thou says I am rich and increase with
[30:50] good and have need of nothing notice
[30:52] that thou art wretched and miserable and
[30:54] poor and blind and naked
[30:55] the world is poor blind naked and they
[30:58] don't even know it right all right
[31:00] brother amen
[31:01] yeah they're in zombie mode they don't
[31:04] even know it right right that's right
[31:06] they're so stuck with American Idol and
[31:08] they're so stuck with all these Legacy
[31:10] with the Stars and all these different
[31:11] shows and all these different things
[31:13] Hollywood is just constantly bombarded
[31:15] and they just uh right yeah and then
[31:18] there's a little thing going on here
[31:19] this TV show comes on uh another TV show
[31:23] and it's just constantly that's how the
[31:25] world is you go out to the mall and you
[31:27] go to the mountain you look at people's
[31:29] faces exactly the young people today
[31:31] sure there's no life in them
[31:34] it seems like there's a force that's
[31:36] controlled but you see the bride of
[31:37] Christ has life amen amen right that's
[31:39] right the bride of Christ should be
[31:41] different that's the reason why we're
[31:42] separating people amen because there's
[31:44] life dwelling within us right right it's
[31:47] done how many of y'all heard that case
[31:49] of in Miami that took place last year
[31:51] about the uh the Apocalyptic Zombie
[31:54] it was last year last May and uh there
[31:57] was a there was a man who was on there
[31:59] these bath salts and bath salts what it
[32:01] is is uh it's a it's a code word for
[32:04] these drugs and they they mix together
[32:05] or this particular person was under
[32:08] these these uh uh these bath salts and
[32:11] he got apparently these bath salts what
[32:13] they do to your bodies they make you
[32:14] really warm From the Inside Out make you
[32:16] really hot the man was on these things
[32:18] and he got really hot and so he started
[32:21] stripping his clothes off and he was
[32:23] naked in the middle of Miami nice to
[32:25] know he finds this man this this
[32:27] homeless man and he starts beating this
[32:30] man starts tearing his clothes off and
[32:33] you can you can see what kind of spirit
[32:35] he was on a demonic Spirit right starts
[32:39] beating the man and then finally
[32:40] somebody calls the cops and they
[32:42] actually caught it on surveillance
[32:43] camera and you can actually see it if
[32:45] you could go to the internet you can
[32:46] actually see it but
[32:48] um uh the the when the police came they
[32:51] tried to tell the man this you know try
[32:52] to try to get him off and the man was so
[32:54] I mean it was demons he actually snarled
[32:57] at the cop like that and the cop they
[33:01] couldn't stop him so they finally they
[33:02] had to shoot him down right and they and
[33:04] it took five shots to to completely kill
[33:07] them right and what the man was doing
[33:09] actually to this homeless man was he was
[33:11] actually he had knocked them down hurt
[33:13] him really bad and what he was doing he
[33:15] was actually biting his face off with
[33:18] his physical teeth he was not biting his
[33:20] face off he completely disfigured this
[33:22] man's face that he had to have
[33:23] reconstructive surgery he lived but he
[33:26] had to have reconstructive surgery wow
[33:28] now you see I tell that the example
[33:30] because to show you the world one
[33:31] zombies they got zombies yeah that's
[33:34] right see they got a zombie and that's
[33:35] not the only case right there's cases
[33:37] multiple cases around the United States
[33:39] of people literally flesh eating eating
[33:42] humans you usually hear uh things like
[33:45] that down in the jungles of Venezuela in
[33:47] Africa or something like that but it's
[33:48] actually taking place among
[33:50] civilizations you see yeah there's
[33:52] nothing but demons there's nothing but
[33:54] the spirit of the age you see right
[33:56] that's the reason why let's take a look
[33:58] and see is what what are these zombies
[34:00] why is the world portraying zombies
[34:02] because the world is constantly just
[34:04] want to portray death that and pushing
[34:06] death death to our and and if you're not
[34:09] careful you can be identified with these
[34:11] things you see it on young people's
[34:14] coats and they have skulls all over them
[34:16] and all kinds of stuff you see it's just
[34:18] a tongue culture of death right
[34:22] as we read they they were also like the
[34:25] Sardis age where they had a name that
[34:28] they lived but were dead right amen and
[34:31] you can read that in Revelations 3 1.
[34:32] amen now I'm trying to move a little
[34:34] quickly here now there in verse one in
[34:38] Colossians where we were reading
[34:39] Colossians 3 verse one it says if you
[34:42] then be risen with Christ seek those
[34:44] things which are above where Christ
[34:45] sitteth on the right hand of God Amen
[34:48] so you were risen a man with Christ amen
[34:51] believer it should be risen in Christ
[34:53] all right but then in verse 3 it tells
[34:55] us that ye are dead right right yeah
[34:58] amen
[35:00] for ye are dead and your life is hid
[35:02] with Christ and God and you're wondering
[35:05] okay Paul's sitting here I'm living in
[35:08] Christ but then he sent me I'm dead
[35:09] right see what is he talking about you
[35:11] see right Amen in verse three it
[35:13] continues to say that your life is hid
[35:15] with Christ in God amen amen and your
[35:18] life has to be hidden in Christ in order
[35:20] for you to be dead into yourself amen
[35:22] right it has to be amen right there's no
[35:25] other way amen as Paul said it also in
[35:27] Romans 8 uh Romans 8 verse 8 through 10
[35:30] says so then that they uh then they they
[35:33] are in the flesh cannot please God right
[35:36] exactly but ye are not in the flesh
[35:39] right but in the spirit right if so the
[35:44] spirit of God dwelled in you you're
[35:46] right amen so you're not in the flesh
[35:48] right but you're even though you are all
[35:51] right but you're not in the flesh right
[35:53] see exactly shouldn't be living in the
[35:55] flesh amen and you shouldn't and when a
[35:58] Christian should if he fall Falls flat
[36:00] on his face amen he should have remorse
[36:03] for that and quickly repent right you
[36:05] see amen now Christian will really do
[36:07] that right amen but if you sit there
[36:09] water in your mud puddle and you don't
[36:11] want to get up amen right something's
[36:13] wrong with your experience amen right
[36:14] you see now if any uh if any man have
[36:18] not the spirit of Christ he is none of
[36:20] his right right I don't even have to
[36:22] explain that that's what makes plain in
[36:24] verse 10 and if Christ being you the
[36:27] body is dead right right all right man
[36:30] are you supposed to have life right
[36:32] right yeah right the body is dead
[36:34] because of sin right but the spirit is
[36:37] life because of righteousness amen how
[36:40] many believe he's our righteousness
[36:42] your afternoon amen so the true
[36:45] Christian as I said the true Christian
[36:47] is truly the living dead right you
[36:51] should be the you are the true Living
[36:52] Dead yeah right Living Dead to yourself
[36:54] right don't give me a run you're not
[36:57] zombies
[36:58] but you're the true
[37:00] as you're growing in Christ you should
[37:02] be dying more to yourself right amen
[37:04] because you're living in him you should
[37:06] be dying as well you see there's no
[37:08] dying going on there's no going up right
[37:10] amen there's got to be dying to take
[37:13] place in your life you see what I'm
[37:14] saying all right amen because you see
[37:16] he's dead the Christian's dead to
[37:18] himself and yet he has life dwelling in
[37:20] him by the spirit amen right amen
[37:23] that's the reason why we have to mortify
[37:25] the Deeds of the flesh right right amen
[37:28] Romans 8 12 tells us therefore brethren
[37:30] we are debtors not to the flesh right to
[37:33] live after the flesh right we don't owe
[37:35] the flesh anything in other words that's
[37:37] right there's nothing that the flesh
[37:39] wants to rise up in your life you don't
[37:41] owe nothing to that flesh because that
[37:43] flesh is going to perish amen right of
[37:45] course one day you know that it'll be
[37:47] resurrected in a glorified body right
[37:49] absolutely but I like what brother Wade
[37:52] was talking about this morning at Sunday
[37:54] school he said this this this body is
[37:57] not is not uh it's not coming in the
[38:00] word birth you see what I'm saying right
[38:02] it's perversion the way we can in this
[38:04] life you see
[38:05] but one day we will have a glorified
[38:07] body amen yes sir praise God
[38:10] Colossians 3 5 tells us mortified
[38:13] Therefore your members which are upon
[38:15] the Earth right amen so Paul here is
[38:18] making it clear amen but the only way
[38:22] you can do that is if the spirit of
[38:24] Christ is living in you that's right
[38:25] right now I know this sounds very simple
[38:27] this afternoon but you see sometimes we
[38:30] get away from Simplicity yeah we get
[38:33] carried away with the Deep things I said
[38:35] and then we forget about the simple
[38:36] things and it helps us to live in Christ
[38:39] amen but so uh the only way amen a
[38:43] Christian should be different from the
[38:46] world Amen that's right a man of
[38:48] Christians should not be in zombie mode
[38:50] constantly that's right like a lead
[38:52] that's right you know like Paul said
[38:54] from one Doctrine to the other right
[38:55] going back and forth the third Testament
[38:59] here over here and the uh what is it the
[39:01] two Soul Doctrine over here in the
[39:03] Perugia over here on the tent over here
[39:06] yeah a lot of Christians live that way
[39:08] they sure are because this brother
[39:10] sounds good and this brother sounds
[39:11] inspiring you know so I'm gonna grow
[39:13] grapple what he's yeah and this other
[39:15] brother Rises up and oh he sounds much
[39:17] better you got the people shouting he
[39:19] got them go over here see yeah right
[39:33] they're walking one way you see they're
[39:36] looking wrong way and then you push them
[39:37] over and then they turn over and you see
[39:39] and they're walking the other way yeah
[39:40] what a zombie is Right
[39:43] a message zombie to me
[39:46] amen
[39:49] so in order to keep living you must be
[39:52] dying hey man that's right praise God
[39:54] yeah amen now there's there's a there's
[39:57] a um
[39:58] there's a process in the human body
[40:01] that's actually you know that our cells
[40:04] uh they have to live and they live and
[40:07] die right right another forever you
[40:11] can't be you can't be who you are and
[40:12] you can't be living if you didn't have
[40:14] cells that were living and dying right
[40:15] see exactly right
[40:17] and that process is called apoptosis or
[40:20] apoptysis I can't remember exactly how
[40:22] you say it but and it's what it is is it
[40:25] keeps the human body in its constant
[40:27] form see yeah because for example the
[40:29] cells between our fingers right
[40:32] if the sales that were growing there if
[40:36] if we didn't if we didn't uh if they
[40:38] didn't die we would actually have
[40:40] overgrowth in our body right see yep we
[40:43] would have over good that's the reason
[40:44] why there's tumors that's the reason why
[40:45] there's cancer and all these different
[40:46] things I mean we know that demons are
[40:48] also absolutely amen
[40:51] amen but now if there's a a different
[40:54] process that if too many cells die at
[40:56] once that's called the necrosis
[41:00] and that's where where it's a form of
[41:03] traumatic cell death right and that's
[41:05] when the body actually ends up with
[41:07] deformities in the body or things like
[41:09] that you see amen so
[41:12] um spiritual apoptosis is what we need
[41:15] in the right yeah amen you have to
[41:18] constantly be living and die right you
[41:20] see as you're living you're done you see
[41:22] what I'm saying but we need is spiritual
[41:24] uptosis in our life amen amen and it's
[41:28] amazing how God you know he does that in
[41:31] the natural right yeah and that's what's
[41:32] Paul's talking about you see we can do
[41:35] it in the spiritual as well right now
[41:37] you have to live you you have to live
[41:39] and the other way to live you have to be
[41:41] dying at the same time that's the only
[41:43] way that a human body can continue
[41:44] growing you see exactly there's got to
[41:46] be cells to die in order for new ones to
[41:48] come up right
[41:49] amen right
[41:51] so a spiritual optosis has to be in
[41:54] place in a Christian's life amen there
[41:57] has to be a constant dying of self
[42:00] amen flesh amen get it out of the way
[42:02] right in order for you to keep
[42:04] spiritually living in Christ Jesus right
[42:06] right amen praise God and now on the uh
[42:09] on the other hand if there's too many
[42:11] cells dying at once yeah man you could
[42:14] hurt
[42:15] yourself as well right it's almost like
[42:18] as if you know if new people come to the
[42:19] church
[42:20] and some of us say well you know Sister
[42:23] hasn't gotten the Revelation about
[42:25] letting her hair grow out yeah some of
[42:27] her sister would just just I don't know
[42:29] when you're gonna let your hair grow out
[42:30] yeah and we were just we just you know
[42:32] we we can't rush certainly you know it's
[42:35] an individual walk of Christ you can't
[42:38] get everybody everything at once because
[42:39] you didn't grow up that way you see and
[42:42] if and if we're not careful if you if
[42:44] you're trying to put too much dying on
[42:46] them you know spiritual you can call
[42:48] spiritual necrosis on the body you see
[42:50] amen and the body won't be able to grow
[42:53] right right see right and there'll be
[42:55] deformities in the Bible right we can't
[42:57] force people into this you see right you
[42:59] can't give people the Holy Ghost it's
[43:01] got to be God to do the work amen that's
[43:03] right if God doesn't do the work brother
[43:05] Dale was the one that did the work yeah
[43:07] then some other brother over here get
[43:09] them pretty pretty easy right but if God
[43:11] did the work amen amen then then they
[43:14] have a foundation they're firming with
[43:15] anybody no matter what happens around
[43:17] them no matter what goes on no matter
[43:19] what what what kind of doctors come in
[43:21] amen they're standing firm on the word
[43:23] right amen amen and the word is the Holy
[43:25] Ghost that's right amen praise God all
[43:27] right brother Brown said I believe
[43:28] brother Brown said you know they want
[43:30] him over where the hot dog supper right
[43:32] yeah and then over here they they went
[43:34] over with a pizza or something oh yeah
[43:37] that's right that's how you go back and
[43:39] forth you know amen
[43:41] so you can't rush anyone's spiritual
[43:43] life amen that's right amen that's what
[43:45] that's the reason why we have to walk in
[43:47] the spirit amen amen Galatians 5 you uh
[43:51] tells us uh let's turn that real quick
[43:54] um
[43:57] because you know
[44:01] you know that zombies uh zombies are the
[44:04] world they all when we were dead we were
[44:06] also walking in the spirit as well
[44:08] yeah yeah the Bible says that we were
[44:11] walking the despair to the power in the
[44:13] area right amen right so the world they
[44:15] walking in the spirit as well amen
[44:20] Ephesians 2 2 where it says Where in the
[44:22] town passed you walked according to the
[44:24] course of this world according to the
[44:25] prince of the power of the Earth the
[44:27] spirit that now worketh and the children
[44:28] of Disobedience right right they're
[44:30] walking in the spirits right right
[44:32] amen but the wrong Spirit right amen
[44:36] now
[44:37] and and we read their in Galatians 5 it
[44:40] says for Brethren ye have been called
[44:42] unto Liberty only use not Liberty for an
[44:45] occasion to the flesh but by love serve
[44:48] one another amen amen in other words you
[44:50] come and then you have your apron on
[44:53] right right amen amen for all the law is
[44:55] fulfilled in one word even in this Thou
[44:58] shalt love thy right neighbor as thyself
[45:00] right but if ye bite and devour one
[45:02] another take heed that ye be not
[45:04] consumed one another right right amen
[45:07] and we get into spiritual zombie mode
[45:09] amen it's very easy to bite and devour
[45:12] one another right amen right that's what
[45:15] a zombie does goes around biting
[45:17] people's necks going around biting
[45:19] people's arms and and and if you're not
[45:22] careful if the Holy Ghost is not we're
[45:24] dealing in your life amen yeah very easy
[45:26] to be backbiting one another right oh
[45:28] yeah man gossip all over the church and
[45:30] all all that right it's very easy amen
[45:33] Satan Creeps in in that way right
[45:36] if you're if you're if you're not in
[45:38] zombie mode and you don't have to worry
[45:40] about it right yeah right yeah right
[45:42] right amen
[45:44] and in verse 16 verse 16 look what it
[45:47] tells us there in Galatians 5 because
[45:49] this is the way we avoid biting an
[45:50] Environ one another right this I say
[45:53] then walk in the spirit and you shall
[45:55] not fulfill the lust of the flesh amen
[45:57] all right so the brother brother come
[46:00] see you say hey pray for such and such

[47:03] think of life and the word life has had
[47:05] a perverted aspect to it because that
[47:07] even life itself has a perverted aspect
[47:09] many times people want to refer to life
[47:12] as having a big time drinking rallying
[47:14] and going out they say this is life how
[47:17] mistaken they are that's death right
[47:19] Miranda says see it's not life it's
[47:22] death right and then a few weeks ago
[47:24] we're in a great famous hotel in Canada
[47:26] where they put me up I went up to my
[47:28] room after my service and there was a
[47:30] young lady perhaps in their late teens
[47:32] 18 19 maybe up to 23 somewhere three or
[47:35] four of them running up and down the
[47:37] floor with just their underneath
[47:38] garments on them
[47:40] and with bottles in their hands running
[47:42] from one room to the other lovely
[47:44] looking young women yeah
[47:46] they got this movie out now uh
[47:50] it's called I think it's called Spring
[47:52] Break and it's exactly they portraying
[47:54] women exactly like brother Brandon
[47:55] talking about here right now around in
[47:58] their underneath garments with drinking
[47:59] bottles of beer and all kinds of stuff
[48:03] as I got off the elevator I stood and
[48:05] looked oh there was something in me I
[48:08] thought oh god well my little Rebecca or
[48:10] Sarah ever come to that
[48:12] and I looked at them they staggered
[48:14] across the floor I just stepped into one
[48:16] side till they passed and walked on out
[48:17] went the other way drinking and I
[48:20] stopped at the end of the hall and
[48:21] looked down again seen lovely ladies
[48:23] which could probably be a real
[48:24] sweetheart to some men and I heard one
[48:27] of them say whoopee this is life yeah
[48:29] and I thought how wrong that is that's
[48:31] death for the Bible says she that liveth
[48:34] and pleasure is dead while she is alive
[48:37] so then we find out that life what we
[48:39] call life then we sign we see signs
[48:42] today such as this where there is
[48:44] Budweiser there's life our perverted
[48:46] that is where there's Budweiser there's
[48:48] death right yeah and we see signs like
[48:51] this too life begins when the Sun goes
[48:53] down no death begins when the Sun goes
[48:55] down the people become night Prowlers
[48:56] they prowl at night and if you notice
[48:58] they take the nature of the evil evil
[49:00] always cries at night in a zombie movies
[49:03] is usually the the zombies are walking
[49:05] around at night amen and I read in an
[49:08] article in magazine one time when I was
[49:10] on an airplane it was about Hollywood
[49:11] and it said that life begins after
[49:13] midnight you should come down on certain
[49:15] streets and certain things and they had
[49:17] the picture of burlesque and so forth
[49:19] that goes on and I said how perverted
[49:21] that is you see if Satan has a kingdom
[49:23] he's got to have a false economy right
[49:26] brother Bob speaking about the economy
[49:28] this morning he's got to have something
[49:30] that he can present to them to make them
[49:33] think they are living right you see
[49:36] but it's absolutely on the vice versa
[49:39] side it's death in the form of life it's
[49:41] a perversion from real life
[49:43] amen and then he said let us settle this
[49:45] and our minds now once and forever
[49:47] there's only one way to have life that's
[49:48] right and to know him is life that's the
[49:51] only way that we can have life and no
[49:52] other way for God has only promised life
[49:54] for Jesus Christ amen amen
[49:58] so you see oh Living Dead and all these
[50:01] zombie things it's only Satan amen
[50:03] trying to fool the world right because
[50:05] Satan can only pervert Yeah you see
[50:07] right but see we have true life we have
[50:09] money why do you want to settle for
[50:11] something fake when you can have them
[50:13] Jesus Christ is the real answer yes
[50:17] praise God so we just thank God how many
[50:20] want to be living dead to yourself right
[50:23] that's right I'm gonna live more dead
[50:26] than that to myself right now so that he
[50:28] can have the preeminence in my life amen
[50:34] praise the Lord Jesus that's right Amen
[50:37] brother uh brother Joe I don't know if
[50:39] you were able to get the PowerPoint
[50:41] presentation up
[50:44] hey man just a little thought this this
[50:46] afternoon and uh um
[50:49] as you all uh some of y'all will know um
[50:51] Tuesday will be uh heading to the
[50:53] Philippines
[50:54] um
[50:55] I was invited to preach a uh uh the
[50:59] youth camp this year there uh or be one
[51:02] of the speakers there and uh so we'll be
[51:04] heading that's coming up next Wednesday
[51:06] is when it's going to start and uh
[51:10] um certainly it's a privilege and you
[51:12] know you kind of get kind of nervous
[51:13] because they're expecting to be over 500
[51:15] youth just youth there right last year
[51:18] there was about 800 wow so um
[51:21] but Lord Weldon we're going to minister
[51:23] that and I also like to be able to swing
[51:26] to Hong Kong China and there's a little
[51:28] work that's going on there and hopefully
[51:30] help those those brothers and sisters
[51:32] there amen
[51:34] um so we're kind of trying to decide I
[51:36] go there and you're kind of at the mercy
[51:37] of the brothers and brothers there you
[51:39] see when they take you wherever wherever
[51:41] they you know and you're only going to
[51:43] be aware where God wants you to be I see
[51:45] so anyway uh we're going to be with one
[51:47] of the royal Soriano most of the time of
[51:49] course y'all remember brother Royal
[51:51] um this is my wife's cousin so when I
[51:54] married Christine I kind of got
[51:57] been into the family you know and but
[52:00] it's been a blessing because it's open
[52:01] doors right but God knows God knows what
[52:04] he's doing amen but uh brother Dale he
[52:07] knows it's the Filipino people they're
[52:09] very humble they're very they're very
[52:11] nice they're very uh and they love the
[52:13] word Amanda amen but last year we had
[52:16] the opportunity to go in January and I
[52:18] just wanted to show you a little a few
[52:20] pictures I was able to stir around the
[52:23] islands about 10
[52:25] we Minister about seven services in 10
[52:28] days and uh and that was you know one
[52:31] run right after the other so needless to
[52:34] say I was pretty tired
[52:36] and uh so go ahead brother Joe we'll
[52:39] pull in uh
[52:41] I mean of course he uses some facts you
[52:43] know the Philippine Islands uh they have
[52:45] over 7 000 Islands uh uh and uh capital
[52:50] is Manila uh Lord Whelan uh we want to
[52:53] try to head down here to uh
[52:56] Palawan
[52:57] there's some works that are starting to
[53:00] uh take up uh starting over there
[53:03] brother Royal he's working really
[53:05] heavily in that area manila's over here
[53:07] so that's where brother Morel lives
[53:09] brother Danny del mundo and some of
[53:11] these other brothers that
[53:13] um
[53:13] and so he constantly goes down here and
[53:16] of course minda now down there real
[53:19] dangerous area
[53:20] so uh they haven't taken us there
[53:22] because it's real dangerous and you have
[53:24] a lot of rebels there a lot of Guerrilla
[53:26] warfare that takes place there of course
[53:28] you got a lot of Muslims
[53:30] um the total population of the entire
[53:32] Philippines as of 2010 is over 93
[53:34] million people
[53:36] so there's still a lot of work to do
[53:38] right amen right go ahead brother
[53:42] um
[53:43] when we were there last year go ahead
[53:46] and hit next brother
[53:47] Joe we were we traveled from Manila

[54:06] the area where um General McArthur
[54:09] stood and said uh I shall return yeah I
[54:12] was actually actually stood in that
[54:14] beach where he actually pulled in and
[54:16] it's kind of interesting so it's a real
[54:18] that area over there is really uh they
[54:21] have a lot of World War II artifacts and
[54:23] things like that there and after that we
[54:25] ministered uh uh there
[54:27] um we headed back to uh to Manila go
[54:31] ahead brother Jeff
[54:34] well well over there they took me to
[54:37] this cave
[54:38] um and uh it's one of those cave with
[54:40] like Limestone formations and all kinds
[54:42] of stuff and uh it's really pretty and
[54:44] it's called the kalau caves and uh
[54:47] there's brother Soriano this is Pastor
[54:49] Rafi uh he's a pastor there now amen
[54:56] this is a video there the kalal caves I
[54:59] don't know if you can play just a little
[55:01] small snippet of that or not

[55:06] you can just hit go to the next okay
[55:08] there you go
[55:14] there's some uh audio that goes along
[55:16] with it but
[55:32] okay
[55:37] the brother uh he just got he was about
[55:39] to get married the next day and uh he
[55:43] was being our tour guide
[55:44] and the next day he was getting ready to
[55:47] get married so uh they were very real
[55:49] serviceable you know they'll get out of
[55:52] the way to just you know
[55:53] good
[55:57] um
[55:59] okay brother Joe you can stop it
[56:03] all right
[56:05] uh we had a that day we had lunch and
[56:09] ministers meeting uh and and this is
[56:11] which was up north where we went up uh
[56:14] we went there by airplane it was about
[56:16] an hour uh airplane ride from Manila
[56:20] um we had lunch with them they actually
[56:21] served me uh something that they call
[56:23] Papa Eaton and they said hey you've
[56:26] heard of papayita and papa Eaton what it
[56:28] is it's uh it's usually goat contestants
[56:32] what they do is they put them in a soup
[56:35] and then what they take is divide the
[56:36] vial and they put squirt it inside the
[56:39] soup so you're eating a bitter soup and
[56:42] sometimes in some other areas what
[56:43] brother Soriano's told me is that they'd
[56:45] actually take the like in the intestines
[56:48] there's still grass and stuff that the
[56:49] goats have eaten nope pour that in there
[56:52] as well
[56:55] so
[56:56] uh I had some of that but this time
[56:58] wasn't go uh it was carabao and carabao
[57:01] is a form it's like a it's a type of a
[57:04] cattle that they have there and uh but
[57:07] it still is better and uh definitely
[57:09] they had some lemons here somewhere I
[57:11] squirted a bunch of lemon juice in there
[57:12] and uh some bananas with it yeah and
[57:16] they said they said oh you wanted to try
[57:17] Papa Ethan and I ended up eating Papa
[57:19] Eating three times that day because they
[57:23] thought they thought you know I just
[57:24] really
[57:27] you know it was okay but that's about
[57:30] that's enough for me
[57:33] foreign
[57:44] there and uh
[57:46] just had a really good time you know
[57:48] with the with the brothers there and
[57:50] just
[57:53] some of the ministers
[57:55] he's a pastor as well most of most of
[57:57] the brothers here are are pastors
[58:01] he's a pastor there in the local area in
[58:04] that same area
[58:06] so we're just having a good time in the
[58:09] Lord go ahead brother Johnny
[58:13] depression
[58:16] all right so that night we ministered uh
[58:19] in andarayan which is there in tubegra
[58:21] and uh um we Minister that brother
[58:25] Pastor Jaime tambawan which is the
[58:27] brother right here
[58:28] and um and we had a really good Timbre
[58:31] of the world was interpreted for me
[58:33] because even though a lot of people
[58:34] there in the Philippines they speak
[58:36] English and they understand it but some
[58:38] of them especially the older ones they
[58:40] they still they only speak Tagalog and
[58:43] so they still have a hard time but the
[58:44] English language but for the most part
[58:46] you can Minister over there and you
[58:48] don't need an interpreter so
[58:51] go ahead
[58:55] and there here's a little clip there
[58:57] from that I don't know if that plays or
[58:58] not
[59:01] he'll clip there from that service the
[59:03] sister right here
[59:04] uh she was Raising her hands she's the
[59:07] pastor's uh daughter I mean not daughter
[59:10] but the pastor's sister
[59:11] and uh she's got a powerful testimony
[59:14] because uh
[59:16] he was Secure uh yeah I believe she had
[59:18] cancer in the brain she fell or
[59:21] something like that and uh she's
[59:23] perfectly normal today is that praising
[59:26] the Lord and she wanted to sing and
[59:28] she's always constantly singing and she
[59:30] came back she she asked me she's like
[59:32] can uh she said uh they don't have they
[59:36] don't have drum set instruments or
[59:38] anything like that she requested she
[59:40] said because she loves music she's like
[59:42] maybe we could get a set of drums
[59:46] and uh but uh these the you see the
[59:50] instruments there because they were
[59:51] actually borrowed from another church so
[59:54] all right you can pause
[59:59] and uh from there we took a tricycle
[1:00:02] ride over to pangasinang where were the
[1:00:05] uh the beach there in uh where General
[1:00:07] MacArthur we ministered there they had a
[1:00:10] a a a church service
[1:00:13] um uh
[1:00:14] an anniversary there at one of the
[1:00:17] churches there and uh we left the area
[1:00:19] where we me and brother Royal were
[1:00:20] sleeping at and they took us in a
[1:00:22] tricycle ride it's a very popular uh
[1:00:24] form of transportation in the
[1:00:26] Philippines and so I got on there it was
[1:00:29] my first time riding on a tricycle so I
[1:00:31] had to take a little video so go ahead
[1:00:33] brother real so you just kind of I mean
[1:00:35] brother Joe does that video play
[1:00:42] and you're right next to the guy driving
[1:00:45] the motorcycle and uh
[1:00:55] they're everywhere uh

[1:17:35] amen
[1:17:37] amen enjoy the message
[1:17:42] foreign
[1:19:07] foreign
[1:20:18] hear me
[1:21:42] foreign
[1:22:58] baby
[1:23:12] baby
[1:24:17] really
[1:24:27] nice
[1:25:40] or Jesus
[1:26:38] foreign
[1:27:19] probably wonder why when we're praying
[1:27:21] for somebody that while we keep singing
[1:27:23] the same verse
[1:27:25] over and over
[1:27:26] see if you stop the music and start
[1:27:28] changing things you can kill the spirit
[1:27:31] that's right A lot of people don't
[1:27:32] realize that you can kill it you can
[1:27:34] stop it you can change the people
[1:27:36] because no matter what you're doing
[1:27:37] being prayed for if that music changes
[1:27:39] if you're gonna your brain goes working
[1:27:41] differently yeah until we just or
[1:27:44] ministers and music and all are
[1:27:46] instructed to keep singing the same song
[1:27:48] as long as we're praying for people
[1:27:50] because that way at least you can say
[1:27:52] well they may have sung that over 20
[1:27:54] times but if it keeps on going we're
[1:27:57] saying 50 times the worries but I'd
[1:27:59] rather do that than to stop and start
[1:28:01] another song and you're going to kill
[1:28:03] things
[1:28:04] tell brother Louise how much you
[1:28:07] appreciate him and the Lord will bless
[1:28:09] him we'll learn the Philippines and all
[1:28:10] the Lord and you know Lord be with him
[1:28:12] it's a like he said they are good people
[1:28:15] they're they're really friendly and
[1:28:18] really nice to you you know and
[1:28:19] everything and it's a good group of
[1:28:21] people to go visit so you know you ever
[1:28:24] get a chance go over there or anything
[1:28:25] be good but just tell him how much you
[1:28:27] appreciate I appreciate everybody and
[1:28:29] let's just pray and be dismissed and
[1:28:31] father
[1:28:32] we thank you Lord for this day our
[1:28:35] brothers are ministering unto us Lord
[1:28:37] and that's just having a little time to
[1:28:38] relax and not have to be worried about
[1:28:41] having to preacher because it's not a
[1:28:43] burden
[1:28:44] but it is hard on the body sometimes and
[1:28:46] hard on us and we just ask you to help
[1:28:49] us and guide us down bless brother Lou
