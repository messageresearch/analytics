[8:08] there's your three long range days
[8:09] november 13th december the 4th and
[8:11] february
[8:12] the 11th i like to give you that so you
[8:15] don't come up and say oh i didn't unders
[8:17] didn't hear what you said
[8:19] brother brown said improving his word
[8:20] listen to this it's another one i pulled
[8:22] up on hold fast
[8:24] you know there's a scripture in the
[8:25] bible in first thessalonians 5 21 where
[8:27] it's written prove all things
[8:30] hold fast to that which is good
[8:32] when anything is proven it will either
[8:35] be proven right
[8:37] or wrong
[8:38] when anything's proven it'll either be
[8:40] right
[8:41] or wrong
[8:43] and when there's anything in question
[8:46] it should be proven until you find out
[8:48] what is right
[8:51] and then as you find what is right it
[8:53] says hold fast in other words grip it
[8:56] don't turn it loose hold it fast in
[8:59] other words hold it tight
[9:01] so that it will not slip hold fast to
[9:03] that which is good
[9:04] after it's been proven right
[9:07] and anything that's proven not right
[9:09] turn loose over real quick
[9:12] get away from it
[9:14] don't never hold on to the wrong thing
[9:17] don't never hold on to the negative
[9:19] don't ever hold on to the wrong thing
[9:21] hold on to the positive and i believe
[9:23] this word of god has been proven right
[9:26] it will never be proven wrong it's
[9:27] always going to be proven right so
[9:28] that's what we're talking about this
[9:30] morning i'm going to put my faith in
[9:31] what the word of god says amen
[9:34] so let's bow our heads lord thank you
[9:36] for the another opportunity to come here
[9:39] and talk about you

[9:44] going to continue and go right on by
[9:46] people are doing things and
[9:48] and past these walls but lord inside
[9:50] these walls father
[9:51] may it be as the priest goes behind the
[9:54] veil
[9:55] as that veil closes
[9:58] every sound of the outside
[10:01] is done away with
[10:03] and it was just you and the priest
[10:05] behind that veil lord

[10:46] who is this son of man part 52
[10:49] we're moving right along
[10:51] i hadn't got to i was looking at brother
[10:53] tim
[10:55] pruitt's
[10:56] website the other day he's on
[10:58] 152.
[11:00] 152
[11:02] of the people of the bible so and it's
[11:06] 52 is not so bad 152. bob could you
[11:09] imagine 152
[11:12] john 1 verse 1. in the beginning was the
[11:14] word i tell you why the word's eternal
[11:16] because that's just part of it
[11:17] that's just pieces of it we just got
[11:19] pieces of it here
[11:21] in the beginning was the word where was
[11:22] with god and the word was god
[11:24] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[11:26] among us
[11:27] we beheld his glory the glory of the
[11:28] only begotten of the father
[11:31] full
[11:32] of grace
[11:34] and truth romans 12 verse 2 says and be
[11:36] not conformed to this world
[11:38] as we were talking about this morning i
[11:40] don't yeah i want you to think that i'm
[11:43] hard on people but i want us to get off
[11:44] the line get off the borderline
[11:48] you remember the story you know the
[11:49] guy's sitting on the fence and the devil
[11:51] comes up and said what are you doing he
[11:52] said i'm sitting on the fence i don't
[11:53] know which way to go he said well don't
[11:54] worry buddy i own defense too
[11:57] okay so the devil owns the fence
[11:59] we need to move away from it as far away
[12:02] as we can all right
[12:04] and be not conformed to this world but
[12:05] be transformed by the renewing of your
[12:08] mind
[12:09] that you may you may prove
[12:11] see god's transferred now the power for
[12:13] you to prove
[12:14] because god's not here
[12:16] god's not hearing human flesh anymore
[12:18] he's here in your flesh
[12:20] what
[12:22] to show
[12:23] who he is not to show that you look like
[12:25] the world and i ain't like the world
[12:27] no way
[12:28] but look be be transformed by the
[12:31] renewing of your mind
[12:33] in other words have a mind change change
[12:36] change your thinking we're tired of this
[12:38] thinking thinking that we're in
[12:41] that ye may prove what is that good
[12:44] and acceptable
[12:46] and perfect
[12:48] word of god because remember his will is
[12:50] his
[12:51] word we're here today
[12:53] reading the will that somebody left us
[12:55] they had to die
[12:57] you can't you don't read a will before
[12:59] you pass away you read will after
[13:01] there's a death all right
[13:03] so someone had to die to give us these
[13:05] promises
[13:07] and they're all written in the bible
[13:08] they're written for me and you for i say
[13:10] through the grace given unto me to every
[13:12] man that is among you not to think of
[13:13] himself more highly than he ought to
[13:16] think but to think soberly according as
[13:18] god as what dealt to every man
[13:21] the measure of faith for as we have many
[13:23] members in one body and all members have
[13:25] not the same office
[13:27] so we being many are one body in christ
[13:29] and everyone remembers one of
[13:32] another you may be seated in the lord as
[13:34] blessing
[13:35] to the reading of the word
[13:37] as we were talking about this morning
[13:39] in first corinthians 13 verse 1
[13:42] though i speak with tongue of men and
[13:43] angels this is a pretty good message
[13:44] believe right it's pretty good resume
[13:47] pretty good resume
[13:49] though i speak with the tongue of men
[13:50] and angels and have not charity i've
[13:52] become a sounding brass or a tinkling
[13:53] symbol
[13:54] though i have the gift of prophecy and
[13:56] understand all mysteries and all
[13:58] knowledge and though i have all faith
[14:00] and so that i could remove mountains and
[14:02] have not charity i am nothing
[14:04] and though i bestow all my goods man
[14:06] this pretty good guy
[14:08] it's for a good person
[14:10] but paul said it's nothing unless you
[14:12] got what the agape love of god not to
[14:15] feel your love but agape love of god and
[14:17] though i bestow all my goods to feed the
[14:19] poor and though i give my body to be
[14:21] burned
[14:22] and have not charity it profiteth me
[14:25] nothing because you know why
[14:27] there's no afterlife without agape love
[14:31] oh yeah i mean you're gonna have a life
[14:32] but you're gonna burn up in hell and
[14:34] eventually you're gonna just go away
[14:35] because hell's not eternal we know that
[14:37] there's no eternal life in hell god's
[14:39] the only one with eternal life
[14:41] right amen
[14:42] we understand those things right
[14:45] so you'll just you just burn up and go
[14:47] away but man i want to have eternal life
[14:49] where i can live
[14:50] where i can talk about what we're doing
[14:52] so i can you know what
[14:53] talk about my plan of redemption that
[14:55] god brought me because you got to think
[14:57] about your plan of redemption that god
[14:58] brought you amen it's not just a blanket
[15:01] thing where it just goes out over no and
[15:02] we're individuals we're all individuals
[15:05] in god but agape love means what
[15:07] brotherly love affection good will love
[15:09] and benevolence
[15:11] so it's not feel your love where you
[15:13] love me i love you it's not that if you
[15:16] say something bad to me i don't like you
[15:18] uh god loves you whether you love him or
[15:20] not
[15:21] forgotten love what
[15:23] whole
[15:24] world whole world he gave his only
[15:27] begotten son but
[15:28] that doesn't mean the whole world is
[15:29] going to be saved that means that you've
[15:31] got to connect back by foreign knowledge
[15:33] he knew it but you got to connect back
[15:34] to that predestined what we're going to
[15:36] talk about here in a minute to that
[15:37] predestinated determination that god saw
[15:40] you want it
[15:41] more than the next guy more than your
[15:43] neighbor
[15:44] i told you a long time ago
[15:46] i'm sitting in the airport and you go to
[15:48] atlanta airport and i mean you sit there
[15:49] at any time
[15:51] you know hour or two hours you're gonna
[15:53] see five or six thousand people walk by
[15:55] you
[15:56] business airport in the united states i
[15:58] mean it's just biggest airport in the
[15:59] world now i think but you just see
[16:01] thousands of people that have nothing
[16:05] especially them that are going really
[16:06] fast
[16:08] because they fixed trying to catch that
[16:09] flight you hear that little thing going
[16:11] you know they're trying to drag gina and
[16:12] those don't know about oh you know what
[16:14] i'm talking about bob
[16:15] no
[16:18] that's why i'm sitting there a long time
[16:20] before the flight starts and i can see
[16:23] these people
[16:24] that are dragging the wheels off of
[16:27] their luggage trying to get to a to a
[16:30] flight hello somebody so anyway
[16:35] michael where are you where are you
[16:36] going to work at you're not
[16:37] delta you leaving delta
[16:41] i guess we'll talk about it later um
[16:44] she's sinking down in this
[16:46] in the chair so anyway
[16:48] but anyway so you sat down and you look
[16:50] at people and and you look at and
[16:53] and like lisa you know just lisa we
[16:55] we observe people and you look and you
[16:57] go
[16:58] god they're good some of them are really
[17:00] good people some of them are not some
[17:02] are really good people why did you
[17:03] choose me
[17:06] and not them and not this person that i
[17:09] talked about here that that could give
[17:10] his body to be burned that knew all the
[17:12] mysteries that had faith to move
[17:13] mountains that i mean this guy that's
[17:15] just he's just a good guy and a good
[17:17] girl why me
[17:19] you know what the lord said just a
[17:21] little still small voice said you chose
[17:23] me
[17:25] they didn't
[17:27] you chose me you made a choice and
[17:29] they'll never make that choice
[17:31] to serve me but you made that choice
[17:34] so don't tell me that we're something
[17:36] special we're not but in mind of god in
[17:38] the mind of god we are special
[17:40] i mean because outside you looked
[17:41] outside there they probably didn't
[17:43] didn't look at me as anything special
[17:45] and i wasn't but then god i'm special
[17:47] because he said you chose me
[17:50] they're not going to choose you they're
[17:51] not going to choose me but you did and
[17:54] that's why i saved you because you
[17:57] wanted to be saved
[17:59] that's just simple salvation to me i
[18:00] mean it's just a wonderful thing
[18:02] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[18:04] god they are the sons of god here we are
[18:06] talking about the family of god
[18:08] that's what i was saying you're sitting
[18:09] there you know and you're in the economy
[18:11] of god you're in the last days and you
[18:13] you know thank god you were given an
[18:15] opportunity not to just be a christian
[18:18] not just to be religious but to have the
[18:22] very bible
[18:25] in the last age opened up by a prophet
[18:28] and you were able to hear that so see
[18:30] you take it from you take it from this
[18:32] big glob of religion
[18:35] to a little bit of christianity
[18:38] to just a little bitty small piece and
[18:40] then we're way over here
[18:43] we came out of her my people
[18:46] we came out of that system
[18:49] and so that makes it even more
[18:51] that i'm happy that god did cross my
[18:53] path not just to make me a christian but
[18:56] to bring me to an end time to where i
[18:58] can have not a faith
[19:00] or a hope i can have the faith of the
[19:03] son of god
[19:05] and be a son and daughter of god and
[19:06] realize that i'm a son and daughter of
[19:08] god
[19:09] son our daughter you i'm putting you
[19:11] inside there
[19:13] for you have not received the spirit of
[19:14] bondage again to fear
[19:16] but you have received the spirit of
[19:17] adoption whereby we cry
[19:19] i have a father that we just sing in
[19:21] that song we that's right that's what
[19:22] our call our call is to adoption
[19:24] spirit itself bear witness with our
[19:26] spirit that we are not going to be we
[19:28] are the children of god and the children
[19:30] then heirs like i said this morning
[19:32] whatever promise that jesus got you're
[19:34] going to get
[19:37] join ours with christ if so be that we
[19:39] suffer with him so you got to do a
[19:41] little bit of suffering
[19:44] that we may be also glorified together i
[19:46] read you that scripture this morning
[19:47] i'll read you another one where it says
[19:48] the trying of your faith
[19:50] be much more precious than gold that
[19:53] perisheth
[19:54] the trial of your face
[19:56] your faith
[19:58] so it's not gonna be a flower bed of
[20:00] ease but oh
[20:01] when we get there
[20:05] it'll all be worth it
[20:07] i have not seen
[20:08] ear has not heard but you know what god
[20:10] give us just a little bitty glimpse of
[20:13] eternity
[20:17] a little glimpse of eternity i was
[20:20] thinking or me and bob was talking about
[20:21] you know you
[20:22] they have people have pieces of truth
[20:28] people have peace and i'm talking about
[20:29] denominations i'm talking about the
[20:30] message i'm talking they're pieces of
[20:32] truth
[20:33] but jesus wasn't pieces of truth
[20:36] he was the truth
[20:37] and that's what our call is the adoption
[20:40] is to take the truth
[20:41] and then portray christ like he's never
[20:44] been portrayed on the earth before
[20:46] in a many remembered group of people
[20:49] that knows when you read into genesis
[20:52] that it wasn't an apple that you eat my
[20:54] heavenly days
[20:57] and when you get to revelations
[21:00] we just see this beautiful picture
[21:03] and everybody else is going i don't know
[21:05] what that is
[21:06] uh what's this symbol here what's that
[21:08] angel doing over there what's that bear
[21:10] that looks like a lion that's got teeth
[21:12] like a
[21:14] right we know all that
[21:17] thank god he sent us a prophet
[21:19] and then and then he set a fivefold
[21:21] ministry
[21:23] to break it down more to the people so
[21:25] that we can understand that we've had 60
[21:27] years now since the prophets left
[21:31] that we've been what breaking it down
[21:33] more to the people and we should be able
[21:34] to thank god that when we open genesis
[21:37] we know what happened in genesis and we
[21:39] open revelations we don't skip over this
[21:41] part
[21:42] we know exactly what happened in the
[21:43] book of revelation we know who we are
[21:46] we know we're the bride not the church
[21:49] because you can't get the you get the
[21:50] two confused
[21:53] also the mind of god versus what's down
[21:55] here
[21:56] we'll read about that just in a minute
[21:57] if we get to it but let's go real quick
[21:59] justification and sanctification we know
[22:01] that
[22:03] we are not
[22:05] baptist in the point that we're once
[22:07] saved always safe where if you just had
[22:10] a had an emotion and shook a hand and
[22:13] and uh and put your name whatever that
[22:15] letter means i don't know what the world
[22:16] that thing means
[22:18] um
[22:19] good grief i mean have we come down to
[22:21] that where it's just it's a letter
[22:23] that you move i had a woman one time me
[22:26] and jim were sitting at a concert
[22:28] um one of the kids were playing josh or
[22:30] one of them was playing and she was
[22:32] sitting in front of us and i can't
[22:33] remember if it was judy
[22:36] judy's
[22:37] yeah i don't know who she was judy's
[22:39] sister
[22:40] she anyway she sent from she leaned back
[22:42] she said if that preacher don't do so
[22:43] and so i'm moving my letter i thought
[22:46] okey dokey
[22:48] i mean that's gonna mean a lot
[22:50] if that preacher don't do so and so i'm
[22:52] gonna move my letter
[22:55] and i did i said what letter
[22:59] she said that letter that you know she
[23:01] was a baptist
[23:03] but i do believe it once saved always
[23:04] saved if you go through justification if
[23:06] you go through sanctification if you go
[23:08] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[23:09] like the bible teaches you
[23:11] that after you've heard the word of
[23:13] truth after you have got this faith and
[23:17] after that you put all these things into
[23:19] play
[23:23] i believe in once saved always safe
[23:27] but i don't believe once saved and then
[23:29] 30 years later they'd you come up
[23:32] and pass away and they said well he was
[23:34] a member in good standing no
[23:37] here we go again
[23:39] go to church
[23:43] i'll get off of it next week sometime
[23:47] what did brother kidri dig say he says
[23:49] i'm about to close all right i'm about
[23:51] to not say anymore back
[23:58] listen we got to sharpen our pencil
[24:01] we all do we all have to up our game
[24:04] sharpen our pencil a little bit more
[24:06] because you know what
[24:07] god cannot get and i don't have it in
[24:09] this sermon but i think a guy in what
[24:10] future one god's not gonna we're not
[24:12] gonna get these virtues if we're not
[24:14] lined up to get them
[24:16] because he's not going to pass them out
[24:18] like you go outside and you just start
[24:19] passing out tracts and you just no
[24:21] there's certain things you got to do
[24:22] that's a requirement of god
[24:24] it's required that you believe the word
[24:27] of god and that you live the word of god
[24:30] it's required now if you don't you don't
[24:32] worry about getting
[24:34] virtual knowledge temperatures godless
[24:35] brother count that's why i keep harping
[24:37] on
[24:38] make sure you're born again make sure
[24:40] you know that you know that you know
[24:42] that you've been justified that you've
[24:43] been sanctified that you what you've
[24:45] been look look at this
[24:47] the name of this sermon a hidden life
[24:50] in christ
[24:52] a hidden life
[24:53] but something you can portray to the
[24:55] world
[24:57] that we're different
[24:59] i want the world to know that i'm
[25:01] different
[25:02] i've got something different than they
[25:04] do and you know what i'm going to get a
[25:05] reward of something different than what
[25:08] they're going to get
[25:09] so are you he said he'd give you a new
[25:11] spirit now that spirit isn't god's
[25:12] spirit that's your spirit
[25:14] god gives you a new spirit see that's
[25:16] where you see that you get a uh
[25:19] as do some i'm not saying just picking
[25:21] on the baptist but they pretty much
[25:23] believe in eternal security which i do
[25:25] if you're born again but i don't if you
[25:27] just shake somebody's hand and you went
[25:29] to church with you as a kid and then you
[25:31] no then you then you can't pull that's
[25:33] what i said with uh john stump when he
[25:35] was my and he was my banker
[25:37] we were out in the water you know and i
[25:39] told johnny handed me up or he tried to
[25:41] have me a beer and i said no i said john
[25:44] i said i've had an experience i said i
[25:45] got saved and he said well praise the
[25:47] lord i have too and he's hold the beer
[25:49] up like this i said what'd you get saved
[25:51] from
[25:54] what you get saved from
[25:55] you're still doing the same thing you've
[25:57] done the last time i saw you
[25:59] but i'm not
[26:01] what's the difference i want us to look
[26:03] at the difference
[26:07] look at the difference as we said this
[26:10] morning we're gonna bring two mannequins
[26:12] in here we're gonna bring two mannequins
[26:14] in there we're gonna dress these like
[26:15] the world and dress these like a the
[26:17] bible tells you to dress they're
[26:19] different
[26:22] amen
[26:23] god wants you to be different
[26:25] oh i don't want to be different
[26:27] you have god in your life you will be
[26:30] different
[26:31] you don't have to act different you will
[26:33] be different because we're going to talk
[26:34] about that renewing of your mind
[26:37] because the thoughts you have now is not
[26:40] the thoughts of god you understand what
[26:41] i mean in your spirit in your regular
[26:43] realm not in your soul but in your in
[26:44] your spiritual realm your spirit realm
[26:47] memory reason conscious effects and
[26:48] imagination is not all of god because we
[26:51] have to be husbands we have to be wives
[26:52] we have to work we have to do the things
[26:54] of life
[26:55] but down inside in that soul
[26:59] that's your type post because so when
[27:00] satan starts beating on that memories of
[27:02] constant affection you've got a tie post
[27:04] down here that's quite different
[27:07] when i was a sinner when satan did
[27:10] something on my outside realm it just on
[27:12] the inside they said yeah baby oh yeah
[27:14] come on
[27:16] but not anymore
[27:18] satan tries to bombard you with
[27:20] something you say no
[27:24] no not now devil
[27:27] boo
[27:29] he says i'll put my spirit in him after
[27:31] this is the new birth but the thing god
[27:32] has to do is give you a new spirit to
[27:34] make your nature a little more gentle
[27:35] and settle down or he couldn't even live
[27:37] with him
[27:38] then the baptism of the holy ghost look
[27:40] since seeing you you have purified your
[27:42] souls
[27:43] like i said before
[27:45] it's just a cop-out when you start
[27:46] talking to people and they say well i
[27:48] can't live that kind of life you ain't
[27:49] perfect night perfect that's not what
[27:51] the bible said
[27:54] the bible said be therefore perfect
[27:57] even as your father look seeing you have
[27:59] purified your soul
[28:01] that's bible
[28:04] it obeyed the truth
[28:06] not some man's idea
[28:08] through the spirit under unfeigned love
[28:10] of the brethren see you love one another
[28:11] with a pure heart fervently
[28:14] i hope you see the fervents of all of us
[28:16] we all bind together and we all become
[28:18] more fervent
[28:20] i believe some have some haven't i'm
[28:22] sorry some have some have it
[28:26] but i want everybody 100 i want them in
[28:29] what was that church age messenger was
[28:30] it martin or somewhere back in
[28:33] back in the uh no it was down in martin
[28:35] or or irena's
[28:38] prayed to god and and and taught his
[28:40] people until everybody in the whole
[28:42] congregation had the holy ghost
[28:46] take care of our problems no
[28:49] tell us how to handle them better yes
[28:51] amen but look being born again not of
[28:54] corruptible seed like i said before this
[28:56] morning i'm looking at corruptable seed
[28:59] i'm looking at people that are
[29:01] getting older
[29:03] right that's corruptible
[29:06] but we are now of incorruptible seed
[29:08] inside of our soul that saul is 20 years
[29:12] old and never get any younger and it'll
[29:14] never get any older
[29:16] by the word of god which liveth in the
[29:19] body forever romans 8 29 for whom he did
[29:22] for no
[29:23] then he also did predestinate to be
[29:25] conformed to the image of his son you
[29:27] know i was thinking the other day
[29:29] brother dick come from presbyterian
[29:31] church
[29:32] and uh
[29:33] their predestination is well this is
[29:35] going to happen
[29:38] as brother dale's always used the
[29:39] illustration
[29:40] this is going to happen so i'm going to
[29:42] step off here because i know that god
[29:44] knows that's what was going to happen
[29:46] no that ain't that way
[29:48] thank god for a prophet that said god
[29:50] didn't put you in a little tube and pull
[29:51] you through and make you do something if
[29:54] he made you do it he's not just
[30:00] but he gave you a choice he lays a
[30:02] choice in front of every person
[30:05] cain had a choice abel had a choice adam
[30:08] had a choice
[30:09] the devil had a choice
[30:13] you were perfect until iniquity was
[30:15] found in you
[30:16] you were my right hand man you were my
[30:18] anointed cherub you walked up and down
[30:20] hey he walks in heavenly places
[30:24] amen
[30:25] but thank god
[30:28] one day
[30:31] when we go up
[30:34] he comes down
[30:36] he can't go to heaven no more
[30:39] because the people he's accusing
[30:42] are up there
[30:43] amen
[30:45] so he's not going to get kicked out of
[30:46] heaven until we leave when we leave and
[30:48] get out of here satan's going to be
[30:50] kicked out of heaven and you better not
[30:51] be down here when he's kicked out cause
[30:53] he's going to be one mad dude
[30:56] because he got kicked out of heaven by a
[30:58] bunch of ragtag
[31:02] sinners
[31:03] saved by grace
[31:06] and applied the blood
[31:08] where it needed to be applied
[31:11] he also did pronounce it predestinate to
[31:13] be what conformed to the image of his
[31:15] son see there's got to be on the power
[31:17] of transformation we look at all these
[31:18] renewing and all there's got to be a
[31:21] change
[31:22] what's the song oh lord there's a change
[31:23] in my life
[31:25] well is there
[31:27] the things i used to do
[31:29] i do them no more
[31:31] things i used to do
[31:33] i do them no more why
[31:36] there's been a change in your life
[31:39] i'm saying that somebody the other day
[31:40] because that's how i'm getting older the
[31:41] things i used to do i can't do no more
[31:44] moreover when he did predestinate then
[31:46] he also called whom he called
[31:49] he called
[31:50] you answered
[31:53] he called you answered yes yes
[31:56] so he justified you god forgive me in my
[31:58] past sins and whom he justified then he
[32:01] also glorified if you're sitting here
[32:03] today with a new birth in your soul
[32:06] you're already glorified
[32:08] your body just hasn't figured it out yet
[32:13] romans 11 verse 2 says god
[32:15] hath not cast away his people
[32:18] which he foreknew
[32:20] can't
[32:22] he can't erase his own mind of his own
[32:24] people
[32:28] ephesians 1 verse 10 said being
[32:30] predestinated look in whom also we have
[32:31] obtained there we go again we've
[32:33] obtained listen we got to be movers and
[32:36] shakers we got to get stuff we got it's
[32:38] not going to be poor i wish god would i
[32:40] wish i could unscrew the top of your
[32:42] head
[32:43] might find something in there might not
[32:45] find anything in there but i could pour
[32:47] this in and you just become it but
[32:49] that's just not the way it's going to be
[32:53] it scares us all to death and him also
[32:55] we have obtained an inheritance so we
[32:56] got to get it
[32:59] being predestinated
[33:01] god knew this is so simple god knew you
[33:03] would want it and work for it
[33:06] he knew it
[33:08] so therefore he can lay it right down
[33:10] the line for you and say look
[33:12] here's what i want this is the will of
[33:13] god i'll read it to you in a few minutes
[33:15] talking about faith
[33:17] faith is given for us to know the will
[33:18] of god
[33:20] and i'll explain that in just a minute
[33:23] that we should be to the praise of his
[33:24] glory look that we should be to the
[33:26] praise of his glory
[33:28] who first trusted in christ and whom
[33:29] also you trusted when after that you
[33:32] heard the word of truth listen you can't
[33:34] know you're condemned unless you hear
[33:35] the word of god
[33:40] something of the word of god has to
[33:42] condemn you
[33:44] to tell you you're lost
[33:47] that's why he sent the word
[33:50] that's why he said that seed word
[33:54] god didn't want us to be born by sex
[33:58] that's why we look in the garden of eden
[34:00] how it all got messed up
[34:03] he wanted it by what spoken word now he
[34:06] has spoken word children he has what he
[34:08] wanted before he has it today
[34:12] in him also you trusted after that you
[34:14] heard the word of truth the gospel of
[34:16] your salvation and whom also after that
[34:19] you believe you were sealed with that
[34:20] holy spirit of promise which is what the
[34:22] earnest of our inheritance until the
[34:25] white redemption of the purchase
[34:26] possession listen he purchased this
[34:28] whole thing
[34:30] just like he purchased the earth when he
[34:32] died and his blood dripped on off
[34:34] calvary and it hit the ground it claimed
[34:37] it listen the blood don't save you
[34:42] the life
[34:43] that's in the blood
[34:45] you could have two gallons of jesus's
[34:47] natural blood and it would do you no
[34:49] good
[34:50] but what's in that blood was life
[34:53] thy life is what's going to give you
[34:55] eternal life that's what he said into
[34:57] thy hands i come in my spirit and his
[34:59] natural blood did fall on the earth and
[35:02] thank god for a prophet that said hey
[35:03] there's the sanctification there's the
[35:05] cleansing process he claimed the earth
[35:08] where was your body in the earth at that
[35:10] time
[35:11] praise god
[35:14] and he said unto them and it's not for
[35:15] you to know the times of the season this
[35:17] is jesus getting ready to sin
[35:19] but you shall receive power after
[35:21] that the holy ghost has come upon you
[35:24] you shall be witnesses to me in
[35:25] jerusalem judea samaria
[35:27] lulu georgia
[35:29] and that means
[35:32] dunamis
[35:35] close enough okay
[35:37] we have a greek in our presence today so
[35:38] i have to say it right inherent power
[35:41] power residing in a thing by what virtue
[35:43] of its nature
[35:47] nature
[35:49] which personal thing exerts and puts
[35:50] forth power for performing miracles
[35:52] moral power and excellence of soul we've
[35:54] read these things many times so let's
[35:56] just read what happens after the holy
[35:57] ghost comes after that power come why is
[35:59] it power
[36:01] because what look
[36:02] they were the group that heard the
[36:04] messenger and his message
[36:07] and took it and lived it
[36:10] took it and lived it
[36:13] luther
[36:14] they took it they lived it we were
[36:17] talking about yesterday or the other day
[36:18] when i was talking to the
[36:20] to the girls at work about why women
[36:22] can't preach
[36:24] i i don't say why women can't preach why
[36:26] they shouldn't preach because that's
[36:26] what the bible says
[36:28] but um
[36:29] you know we
[36:30] we were looking at that we were talking
[36:32] about wesley which is the methodist
[36:35] founder of the i don't know why people
[36:36] have problems with us having a prophet
[36:39] i really don't you know why because he's
[36:41] contrary to all them others
[36:43] because martin luther obviously was the
[36:46] founder of the lutheran church
[36:48] and john wesley
[36:50] according to the method that he used
[36:53] become now a methodist
[36:55] and that was a man john wesley
[36:58] we had a man come
[37:00] that was filled with the spirit of god a
[37:02] church aged messenger called william
[37:03] branham and he brought us a word
[37:06] that we live by
[37:08] not something outside the bible
[37:10] but he straightened up the people that
[37:12] were trying to give it their own
[37:14] interpretation
[37:15] now the methodists are trying to put
[37:18] women and and
[37:21] i guess we can say gays we can't say
[37:22] queers gays
[37:25] preaching and even women behind the
[37:27] pulpit when the bible says and one of
[37:29] them said well that's old testament i
[37:30] said no new testament
[37:33] but it happened because of the old
[37:35] testament that's what they said well
[37:36] what happened in genesis i thought you
[37:38] should not ever ask me that
[37:41] because i'm going to tell you why a
[37:41] woman can't preach
[37:44] because she messed up in the garden
[37:47] and you know what you sisters ought to
[37:48] say thank god
[37:49] that's one burden on me i don't have to
[37:52] if i have this urge to get behind the
[37:53] pulpit you know it's the devil
[37:56] okay
[37:58] leave it to the men
[38:00] sorry it's not male chauvinism
[38:03] very clear he said i he said i say do
[38:06] not let a woman usher up authority or be
[38:09] in other words have any control over the
[38:11] church
[38:12] because she goes by our emotion that's
[38:15] something we need to cover bob on that
[38:17] list
[38:19] we'll tell you about that later but he
[38:21] and i are working on something
[38:22] but you know you say well you shouldn't
[38:24] do this but we need to have a biblical
[38:28] view of everything
[38:30] we can't say william branham said and
[38:31] that just be it not to the people that
[38:33] are coming in
[38:35] because you they say just like they did
[38:37] before
[38:38] or who is he
[38:40] it's in the bible
[38:42] everything's in the bible
[38:44] and that's why i said face final resting
[38:46] places in the word of god
[38:48] it's not in man's ideas
[38:50] because jesus stood one day and we'll
[38:52] read it in a few minutes jesus stood one
[38:53] day and said you have made my word
[38:57] of none effect to the people because
[38:59] you're pouring water you're diluting
[39:02] what i'm saying by the traditions
[39:04] of man
[39:07] i mean listen
[39:11] who told you
[39:14] sisters that you could preach
[39:16] wasn't god
[39:19] all right
[39:20] right
[39:21] because the bible tells you not who told
[39:23] you you could wear a pair of pants
[39:26] the bible says it's an abomination
[39:29] that's old testament so it's the ten
[39:31] commandments
[39:34] the bible tells us for sisters not to
[39:36] cut her hair
[39:39] that's bible
[39:41] that's not something we pulled out of
[39:42] the air
[39:44] and that's the promise of god that we
[39:46] should be living by
[39:50] so i said this morning you brothers are
[39:52] going to be held accountable for what
[39:55] your wife wears
[39:57] well i don't want to hurt her feelings
[39:58] i'm not here for feelings
[40:03] that's why a woman don't need to be back
[40:04] here because she's going to be emotional
[40:06] she's going to be over on this side of
[40:07] the emotion and not worry about the
[40:09] truth and what eve did hello somebody
[40:11] come on don't go to sleep
[40:13] you know what eve did
[40:15] she turn the word of god down she she
[40:17] listened to the twisting of the devil
[40:19] and she said okay let's do that
[40:23] but i say unto you that every idle word
[40:25] that men shall speak they shall give an
[40:27] account there on the day of judgment
[40:29] brothers
[40:30] you're going to give account for your
[40:32] kids and your wife
[40:33] but remember she don't have to give an
[40:35] account for herself you do
[40:37] so you're responsible because you're the
[40:39] strong one
[40:40] listen
[40:43] christ
[40:44] is responsible
[40:46] for his bride
[40:48] right
[40:50] we're not responsible for ourselves
[40:53] no we're not not if we're covered by him
[40:54] because that's why we don't have to stay
[40:56] in judgment that's why we're not going
[40:58] through the tribulation period he stood
[41:00] it for us our husband stood our shame
[41:04] he took upon adam took upon eve's shame
[41:09] so same way with with christ and the
[41:11] bride he took on our shame
[41:17] thank god
[41:19] what little bit we give back to him come
[41:21] on folks
[41:22] oh i'm going to be laughed at by the
[41:24] world and ridicule good
[41:26] that means you're not of the world
[41:30] i just read you if you're of the world
[41:33] you're not of god
[41:35] for by thy words thou shalt be justified
[41:38] and by thy words thou shalt be condemned
[41:42] well i don't want to hurt my wife's
[41:44] feelings
[41:44] you'll hurt them some other way so don't
[41:46] worry about it
[41:47] you've been married long enough you will
[41:49] hurt your wife's feelings
[41:52] well i didn't get any demands out of
[41:53] that but
[41:58] but you're going to give an account for
[41:59] her just like christ has now given an
[42:01] account for us
[42:03] because he's standing in my place
[42:06] and god can't go can't do anything to
[42:08] the bride because he's got
[42:10] christ standing in between the husband
[42:12] he's got the husband standing here the
[42:14] husband says i'll take her shame
[42:18] if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[42:20] lord jesus and believe in your heart
[42:21] that god has raised him from the dead
[42:23] thou shalt be saved for with a heart man
[42:25] believeth unto righteousness and with a
[42:27] mouth confession is made unto salvation
[42:30] confess is to admit or declare one's
[42:32] self-guilt
[42:33] i'm guilty
[42:35] i'm guilty
[42:37] who are you gonna throw it on throw it
[42:39] on somebody else no you're gonna be
[42:41] you're the one that's gonna stand in
[42:42] judgment not not me
[42:45] i'll stand for me you got to stand for
[42:47] you but you know what i got we've got
[42:48] one standing for us
[42:51] so when we go to when we go to the white
[42:52] throne judgment that's why we're with
[42:54] him in judgment not being judged because
[42:57] he was judged at calvary
[42:59] you and i were judged at calvary if
[43:01] you'll take it and believe it
[43:03] confess your faults one to another and
[43:05] pray one for another that you may be
[43:07] healed the effectual fervent prayer of a
[43:08] righteous man availeth much
[43:11] possess to acquire get procure a thing
[43:13] for one
[43:15] for oneself to possess to marry a wife
[43:18] that's what he did he
[43:20] he took me
[43:22] and you're either possessed of the devil
[43:24] or of god right now today there is no in
[43:27] between you're either possessed of the
[43:28] devil or you're possessed of god if
[43:30] you've got the baptism the holy ghost in
[43:31] your soul you're possessed of god if you
[43:32] don't you're possessed by the devil
[43:36] then people out there yeah they're
[43:37] possessed too they're everybody's
[43:39] possessed of something like i said
[43:40] before their spirit's with us everywhere
[43:43] we go
[43:45] we just got to fight them off and we've
[43:47] got something
[43:49] i like that we got something to fight
[43:51] them with
[43:52] the world don't
[43:53] they don't know how to handle it oh yeah
[43:55] they know how to handle it
[43:57] pill bottle
[43:59] just pop me some of this over here and
[44:00] pop me some of this over here
[44:02] take a little gospel and it might help
[44:04] you
[44:08] every one of you should know how to
[44:09] possess his vessel and sanctification
[44:11] you have to learn this
[44:12] it's a process it's not a dump on me
[44:15] today it's a process
[44:17] everything's a process you didn't become
[44:19] an adult in a couple years did you some
[44:22] of us haven't become adults in 50 years
[44:25] praise god anyway
[44:27] every one of you should know how to
[44:28] possess his vessel in sanctification and
[44:30] honor that's why the word of god is the
[44:32] will of god
[44:34] and watch this right here who is god in
[44:36] 1950 brother adam said look when the
[44:38] inspiration of the holy spirit is here
[44:40] to inspire you this is a new quote so
[44:41] you can wake up and listen to this one
[44:43] when the inspiration of the holy spirit
[44:45] is here to inspire you remember god will
[44:47] make your body
[44:49] come into your confession
[44:52] he will make your body listen
[44:54] but you got to go the way the
[44:56] inspiration of the holy spirit is here
[44:58] to inspire you that ain't nothing but
[45:00] the truth that's what hattie wright
[45:02] stepped into one day and she said that
[45:05] ain't nothing but the truth brother
[45:06] branham and he said thus saith the lord
[45:08] he said whatever you want lady he said
[45:10] you asked it and god will give it to you
[45:12] she could ask for 10 billion dollars and
[45:14] god would have laid it right there on
[45:15] the table for her but she asked the
[45:17] greatest thing she could ever ask for
[45:19] she said i need i want the salvation of
[45:21] my two children and all they just fell
[45:23] down and just
[45:24] gave the heart to god
[45:27] god will make your body come into your
[45:29] confession if you say you're a drunkard
[45:31] and want a drink don't worry you'll soon
[45:33] be one
[45:35] don't worry you'll soon be one if you
[45:38] say you're a sinner and you want to sin
[45:40] you'll be right into it
[45:43] but if you say you're a christian and
[45:45] believe it all along god will bring your
[45:47] testimony will bring you right into it
[45:50] if you believe in healing
[45:51] believe that god has healed you confess
[45:54] it and god will make your body obey your
[45:57] confession
[46:01] because he's the high priest of your
[46:02] confession
[46:05] sitting at the right hand of the father
[46:06] now with his own blood to make
[46:07] intercession for any confession upon
[46:10] anything that he died for and he died to
[46:13] rid sin
[46:15] and sickness is a result of sin
[46:18] he was wounded for our transgressions
[46:20] with his stripes we were healed remember
[46:21] that have faith don't waver
[46:23] stand on it
[46:24] blind bartimaeus some people touch the
[46:26] garment of jesus and made well
[46:28] others smacked him in the face and hid
[46:30] them in the head with sticks and spit in
[46:31] his face never felt any virtue at all
[46:34] it was their attitude of approach
[46:37] it depends on what attitude you came in
[46:40] this morning with i'm not adding to it
[46:43] i'm just telling you what brother brown
[46:44] said
[46:45] if you come believing that you're coming
[46:47] to get help
[46:49] and you're confident that you're coming
[46:51] to the right person jesus christ
[46:53] and your coming his provided way of
[46:55] approach you're going to receive
[46:57] something if you come reverently
[47:00] if you come well i'll go touch and see
[47:02] if it helps me that won't do any good at
[47:04] all
[47:05] it's your approach to god's divine
[47:07] article
[47:08] it's what does it now look here's a
[47:11] perfect example just like the brass
[47:13] serpent now what happened in the in the
[47:15] wilderness there was sickness and
[47:17] different things and and you know what
[47:18] moses couldn't get to everybody
[47:21] right
[47:22] so god set up a provision he said if
[47:24] you'll take that same thing that caused
[47:26] to fall
[47:27] come on somebody if you'll take that
[47:29] serpent
[47:31] brass means judgment so he was judged
[47:35] have you ever looked on a have you ever
[47:36] looked outside in your doctor's office
[47:38] and see what their symbol is
[47:40] you see what their seal is
[47:42] it's a snake on a pole
[47:48] now just like the brass serpent the
[47:50] serpent didn't have no virtue in it
[47:52] it was a piece of brass they brought out
[47:54] of egypt neither did the paul have any
[47:56] virtue in it not a bit
[47:58] but it was obeying what god said do
[48:01] well i don't know why i'm not getting
[48:03] anything try to obey what god said to do
[48:07] that's what brought the power what
[48:09] brought the virtue is obedience to the
[48:11] word of god that's why we're going to
[48:13] start with virtue in a couple weeks or
[48:14] maybe next week or week after next
[48:17] it's obedience that's why i keep harping
[48:19] it's obedience to the word of god is
[48:21] what brings these virtues
[48:23] and he said that's the same thing
[48:25] tonight hebrews 11 verse 6 but without
[48:27] faith it is impossible to please him who
[48:30] god for he that cometh to god must
[48:31] believe that he is what he is god one
[48:33] not three
[48:35] one
[48:36] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[48:37] diligently
[48:39] seek him
[48:41] be not conformed to this world but be
[48:42] transformed by what by the renewing of
[48:44] your mind we were talking about this
[48:46] morning you look at that renewing a
[48:47] renovate didn't pull your brain out and
[48:49] throw you another one
[48:51] no he used the brain
[48:53] that you got under carnal
[48:58] corrupt seed
[49:02] you know why because he's going to prove
[49:03] to satan that he can work through you
[49:05] just like he worked through eve
[49:07] just like he worked through cain just
[49:09] like satan's worked through all the evil
[49:10] people in the world god said that's okay
[49:12] that's fine i'm gonna have a group in
[49:13] the end times i'm gonna work through too
[49:16] and i'm going to work my perfect will
[49:18] through those people
[49:20] are you not one of those people
[49:24] the renewing of your mind that you may
[49:25] prove what is that good and acceptable
[49:27] and perfect
[49:29] word of god or will for i say through
[49:31] the grace given unto me to every man
[49:33] that is among you not to think of
[49:34] himself more highly than he ought to
[49:35] think
[49:36] but to think soberly according as y'all
[49:38] had dealt to every man the measure
[49:40] of faith we were talking about that this
[49:42] morning the height the breadth
[49:43] everything listen i want everything
[49:45] god's got
[49:46] if it's if it's in the economy of god i
[49:48] want it
[49:50] and what part of that did jesus not get
[49:52] because if he's
[49:54] if he got it
[49:56] i'm heir to it too
[49:59] to renew a renewal a renovation complete
[50:01] change for the worse
[50:04] no it's a complete change for the better
[50:07] and our own nature listen
[50:10] if you're sitting here today and you
[50:11] don't have the new birth you're contrary
[50:12] to god so everything i'm saying you're
[50:14] gonna you're gonna be fighting against
[50:16] come and read the scripture i'm gonna
[50:18] read you a quote here with brother brown
[50:19] say if you're not born again you're
[50:20] gonna fight against it
[50:23] because your carnal mind is dragging you
[50:24] over to this side
[50:26] trying to reason it out
[50:28] instead of just believing what god said
[50:32] because your own nature is over here
[50:34] it's pulling
[50:36] now you don't have in your soul but you
[50:37] got in your memory reason conscious
[50:38] effects and imagination and it's pulling
[50:40] you toward the world
[50:42] because that's satan's playground
[50:44] greatest battle ever fought
[50:47] but god said
[50:49] i'm going to renew your mind if you'll
[50:50] let me
[50:52] i'm going to give you something over
[50:53] here that'll believe the word of god
[50:55] i'm gonna give you a statue of a perfect
[50:57] man that'll help you
[50:59] that'll establish you
[51:01] make you settled and grounded
[51:03] beloved when i give diligence to writing
[51:05] you the common salvation it was needful
[51:06] for me to write unto you and extort to
[51:08] you that you earnestly contend for the
[51:09] faith
[51:10] which was once delivered unto the saints
[51:12] for there are certain men now watch this
[51:14] certain men
[51:16] crept in unawares
[51:18] who are before of old ordained to this
[51:19] condemnation listen there are preachers
[51:21] ordained to do what they're doing there
[51:23] are people ordained to do what they're
[51:25] doing all right
[51:26] the prophet of god said they'll sit in
[51:28] the congregation and refute the word of
[51:29] god now
[51:30] and they do it all the time
[51:33] ungodly men turning the grace of our god
[51:35] into lasciviousness and denying the only
[51:37] lord god our lord jesus christ what's
[51:39] what jesus said in mark 7.
[51:41] he answered and said to them well how
[51:43] isaias prophesied of you hypocrites
[51:47] think i'm
[51:48] tough that is as it is written this
[51:52] people honor me with their lips but
[51:54] their heart
[51:56] in other words their soul
[51:58] is far from me
[52:00] how being in vain do they worship so
[52:02] they're christian they worship
[52:05] so how being in vain do they worship me
[52:07] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[52:10] of men
[52:12] for laying aside the commandment of god
[52:14] you hold the traditions of
[52:16] men it really tickles me i mean it
[52:19] really doesn't of how blind people are
[52:22] because you know even in the um
[52:25] i guess you might say the
[52:27] protestant world because you got
[52:28] protestants and catholics because pro
[52:30] they protested the catholic church and
[52:32] came out of the catholic church so they
[52:33] pro protestants
[52:35] but
[52:37] read their history
[52:39] they believe everything the catholics
[52:41] believe except just a few little items
[52:44] so
[52:45] don't talk about that old mother
[52:46] because she had some kids
[52:50] for laying aside the commandment of god
[52:53] you hold the tradition of men as a
[52:55] washing of pots and cups and many other
[52:57] such things like that you do
[53:00] like things you do and he said unto them
[53:02] now this is jesus full well you reject
[53:05] the commandment of god
[53:08] full well
[53:10] that ye may keep your own
[53:12] tradition
[53:14] listen
[53:15] if it's not in the word of god it's a
[53:17] tradition
[53:20] amen
[53:22] and god can't quicken it but if we have
[53:24] come now as we have this lost faith we
[53:27] were talking about because jude said
[53:29] you've lost it
[53:30] we got to get it back
[53:32] so we have now the faith of the fathers
[53:34] listen in the book of acts
[53:37] there was no denominational idea in the
[53:39] book of acts
[53:41] there was no three gods
[53:43] there was no trinity there was no
[53:45] baptism father son holy ghost show it to
[53:48] me
[53:49] they didn't have those traditions
[53:52] they had the pure word of god that's why
[53:54] we had to have a prophet take us back to
[53:56] that
[53:59] and then we will have the faith for the
[54:01] time that's needed our faith is for a
[54:03] body change
[54:04] that lady at the that touched his
[54:06] garment she needed to be healed the
[54:08] woman come with a perfect faith for her
[54:11] time luther came with the perfect faith
[54:13] wesley came with the perfect faith for
[54:15] his time
[54:16] pentecost came with the perfect faith so
[54:18] did john smith with the baptist so did
[54:21] all the different ones that set up the
[54:22] different denominations at first they
[54:24] were good god worked through that but
[54:26] remember he moved on
[54:27] they cabbage down and said nope this is
[54:29] it
[54:30] and then what the traditions of man got
[54:33] involved
[54:35] i mean i can remember going to church at
[54:37] the baptist church in gillsville when i
[54:39] was um
[54:41] i think we left in 68 so i was eight
[54:42] years old
[54:44] they want no pants wearing a women in no
[54:46] church
[54:47] now they might have cut their hair and
[54:49] wore some jewelry but
[54:51] uh ted you're i mean
[54:53] none
[54:55] when you went to church you were
[54:56] reverent you wore a dress and you didn't
[54:58] wear one that you had to pull the seams
[55:00] down to get it below you
[55:03] now i say crotch but used to be used to
[55:06] be
[55:06] knees i'm sorry but
[55:08] it's just become pitiful
[55:10] but there wasn't none of that now what's
[55:12] happened what's crept then something's
[55:14] crept in and said you can do that now
[55:18] they're having a camp meeting over at
[55:19] lebanon over where i uh deliver mail and
[55:22] it's daddy's brother that preached there
[55:24] for years and years and years well it
[55:26] just looks like a beach party
[55:29] literally
[55:31] girls and men in shorts and tank tops
[55:33] and everything else walking around the
[55:34] campground
[55:36] how is that god
[55:38] but you know what somebody told them it
[55:40] was okay for them to do that god didn't
[55:44] god didn't tell them that
[55:48] so then look let's be let's if god
[55:51] didn't tell him to do it who did
[55:54] there's only two forces
[55:57] belief and unbelief there's only two
[55:59] forces
[56:00] oh yeah he's got all these demons over
[56:02] here and god's got all these good angels
[56:04] but all they can do is they can try to
[56:06] influence you you're the one that's
[56:07] gonna have to take it and say okay i'll
[56:08] do it
[56:10] don't blame the devil for a lot of stuff
[56:12] blame yourself
[56:14] notice now perfect faith is a master of
[56:16] all circumstances
[56:18] perfect faith masters all circumstances
[56:20] as we i'm going to skip through that
[56:22] because we were talking about before
[56:24] paul and and daniel and and even david
[56:27] we were talking downstairs you look they
[56:30] s the whole the whole story is built
[56:33] around a promise
[56:35] daniel had a promise in two years you're
[56:37] going to come out of captivity
[56:39] paul
[56:40] you got to go to rome remember the holy
[56:42] spirit they wanted him not to go but he
[56:44] said you got to go to rome and see
[56:46] caesar so paul says paul took that and
[56:49] said hey i can't die
[56:51] i don't care blow the ship up
[56:54] and he did
[56:57] god told him though said if you'll stay
[56:58] on that boat
[57:00] and all that people stay on that boat
[57:01] i'll save every one of them
[57:03] and then paul walks out and he's picking
[57:05] up sticks being a good servant that he
[57:07] is
[57:08] picking up sticks you know he wasn't he
[57:09] sitting over in the rock say bless god
[57:11] y'all go over there and get them things
[57:12] no he was up there picking up picking up
[57:15] stone picking up sticks to build a fire
[57:18] and a snake beat him on the hand
[57:21] and you know what as i said before if
[57:23] those island people looked at him and
[57:24] said well he must be a demon because
[57:26] they've had this horrible wreck and and
[57:28] now they're stranded on this island said
[57:30] he must be a murderer he must be a liar
[57:32] he must be something well buddy when
[57:34] that snake latched onto his hand and
[57:35] they're sitting there watching him and
[57:37] he's still
[57:40] hour later he's still
[57:42] stoking the fire
[57:44] you know what the bible says they said
[57:46] he must be a god
[57:51] look how that changed
[57:55] god took that
[57:56] faith that paul had
[57:58] and the faith that david had it wasn't
[58:00] so much that david was going to sling
[58:01] that you know he was so mighty that that
[58:04] rock was going to kill it really didn't
[58:05] kill goliath remember
[58:07] it only knocked him down so he could cut
[58:09] his head off because see remember david
[58:10] prophesied and say i'll kill you today
[58:12] he said i'll take your head off today
[58:15] but david knew since he was anointed by
[58:18] samuel several years later that he was
[58:20] going to be the king of israel so he
[58:22] believed what his prophet said
[58:24] and believing what his prophet said
[58:26] there's nothing going to stand in the
[58:28] way same thing with me and you
[58:31] we had a prophet tell us we're going to
[58:33] be changed in the morning in 2009 hour
[58:35] we're gonna stand here and death is not
[58:36] gonna be anything but like a
[58:39] just
[58:43] oh that's a fairy tale maybe to you
[58:45] it ain't a fairy tale to me
[58:48] james one verse 2 my brother encountered
[58:50] all joy here we go count it all joy when
[58:52] you fall into many temptations knowing
[58:54] that the trying of your faith worketh
[58:56] patience but let patience have her
[58:59] perfect work that you may be perfect oh
[59:01] really
[59:02] perfect
[59:04] in christ i'm perfect
[59:06] me i'm not but i'm in christ
[59:08] an entire wanting nothing
[59:12] james 2 verse 14 what does it profit my
[59:14] brother though a man say you have faith
[59:16] and not have words can faith save him
[59:18] if a brother or sister be naked or
[59:20] destitute of daily food
[59:22] and one of you saying to them depart in
[59:24] peace be you warmed and filled
[59:26] now here's the story
[59:28] it wasn't that you gave him anything
[59:31] you just told him to get out of him
[59:33] leave one of you says oh depart in peace
[59:36] you wear whatever you want to it ain't
[59:38] going to matter
[59:40] it must matter to god
[59:43] jezebel would have had a different
[59:44] opinion of that
[59:46] she got fed to the dogs but you know why
[59:48] she got fed of the dogs because elisha
[59:50] elijah prophesied
[59:52] that she'd be fed to the dogs
[59:54] if a brother and sister be naked and
[59:55] destitute of daily food and one of you
[59:57] say unto them depart in peace be warmed
[59:59] and filled look notwithstanding you give
[1:00:01] them nothing
[1:00:03] you give them not those things which
[1:00:05] they needed like clothes
[1:00:08] and and and food
[1:00:11] which are needful to the body what do
[1:00:12] they profit even so faith
[1:00:15] if it hath not works is dead being alone
[1:00:18] yeah a man may say thou hast faith and i
[1:00:20] have works
[1:00:21] show me thy faith without thy works and
[1:00:23] i'll show you my
[1:00:25] my faith by my works is faith expressed
[1:00:30] now believe us that there is one god
[1:00:32] that'll do us well the devils also
[1:00:33] believe
[1:00:35] and tremble
[1:00:38] most of our denominations believe in
[1:00:39] three
[1:00:40] and the devil knows it
[1:00:42] and he only believes in one
[1:00:44] like he's supposed to
[1:00:46] but will thou know o vain man that faith
[1:00:49] without works is dead
[1:00:51] was not abraham our father justified by
[1:00:53] works when he had offered isaac his son
[1:00:55] upon the altar
[1:00:57] this is a little confusing until you
[1:00:59] read what a prophet said
[1:01:01] see us thou now how faith wrought with
[1:01:03] his works and by works was faith made
[1:01:05] perfect
[1:01:06] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[1:01:07] says abraham believed god and it was
[1:01:09] imputed or accounted to him for
[1:01:11] righteousness and he was called the
[1:01:13] friend of god
[1:01:14] you see then how that by works a man is
[1:01:17] justified and not by faith only
[1:01:20] likewise also was not rahab the harlot
[1:01:22] justified by works when she received the
[1:01:24] messengers and had sent them out another
[1:01:25] way
[1:01:27] for as the body without the spirit is
[1:01:28] dead so faith without works is dead
[1:01:32] also thank god for a prophet
[1:01:34] listen to this john expressed his faith
[1:01:36] in what god had revealed to him
[1:01:39] therefore works is faith testimony
[1:01:44] when you see you acting like you're
[1:01:46] healed then you'll know you've got faith
[1:01:48] that you're healed
[1:01:50] what does testimony say saying this i
[1:01:53] have it now because i received god's
[1:01:55] promise
[1:01:56] it is now working in me i am making
[1:01:58] ready for it to happen uh-huh see that's
[1:02:01] what you that your works does well sure
[1:02:03] all right
[1:02:04] faith without works is dead cleveland
[1:02:06] ohio up there close to where we just
[1:02:08] were at
[1:02:11] it looks like paul was speaking in
[1:02:12] romans the fourth chapter justifying
[1:02:14] abraham by faith and james is justified
[1:02:16] by works
[1:02:17] but it does not contradict paul look
[1:02:20] clears it all up right here paul was
[1:02:23] speaking of what god saw
[1:02:25] james was speaking of what man saw
[1:02:29] wow
[1:02:30] paul was speaking of what god saw in
[1:02:32] abraham in genesis 6 when he told him he
[1:02:34] was going to have a child and abraham
[1:02:36] believed god and it was imputed or
[1:02:38] counted in him for righteousness he
[1:02:39] believed the promise that's what god saw
[1:02:42] and then james speaking was speaking of
[1:02:43] what man saw in genesis 22
[1:02:46] where abraham offered up isaac see what
[1:02:48] faith is
[1:02:49] what faith you have that's what god sees
[1:02:53] but what your works is is what your
[1:02:55] neighbor sees
[1:02:59] one more time
[1:03:01] what faith you have
[1:03:03] is what god sees
[1:03:05] but what your works is
[1:03:08] that's what your neighbor sees
[1:03:12] show me your works by your faith without
[1:03:14] your faith or i'll show you my works by
[1:03:16] my faith
[1:03:18] if i'm walking outside and
[1:03:20] and our neighbors they're they're
[1:03:22] they're gay men but they've asked us
[1:03:24] more questions about religion than most
[1:03:26] people in our whole community
[1:03:28] but uh and i've never seen them be
[1:03:30] intimate outside the house so it doesn't
[1:03:32] make me i don't want to shoot them i
[1:03:34] want to love them
[1:03:37] but if i walked outside and jim walked
[1:03:39] outside and shielded a pair of shorts
[1:03:41] and you know she's smoking a cigarette
[1:03:42] then on sunday we get all dressed up and
[1:03:45] we in this message thing you know
[1:03:50] we're showing that we don't have faith
[1:03:53] by the works that we do
[1:03:56] and if we go to work and i start cussing
[1:03:57] like a sailor and see what i mean the
[1:03:59] world doesn't might see like that's when
[1:04:01] they'll go oh you're not perfect
[1:04:04] i'm not either but i don't cuss
[1:04:07] i don't smoke
[1:04:09] i don't drink
[1:04:10] i don't run around
[1:04:12] all that got tore out of me
[1:04:14] is sanctification
[1:04:16] and then god put the
[1:04:18] soul of himself inside of me so you know
[1:04:20] what i try to act like god yeah you i
[1:04:22] know we're not all perfect but that soul
[1:04:24] inside of you is if you'll let that
[1:04:26] thing work
[1:04:28] let that thing out
[1:04:29] let it work
[1:04:32] you will become
[1:04:33] the perfect walking word of god
[1:04:40] listen to this now all right now
[1:04:43] you ready
[1:04:44] all right bob well are you ready
[1:04:50] our ministers
[1:04:52] our ministers every one of them has up
[1:04:54] their game
[1:04:59] every one of them
[1:05:01] they bring some stuff i'm astonished
[1:05:02] with
[1:05:06] but you know what it's not me to it's
[1:05:08] not me to judge them
[1:05:10] but when they bring the word of god
[1:05:12] folks
[1:05:15] and you get something out of it
[1:05:18] notice i believe that this audience here
[1:05:20] has faith
[1:05:22] i believe that
[1:05:24] but i believe you're afraid to turn it
[1:05:26] loose on works
[1:05:31] i believe that if you just let your
[1:05:33] faith loose
[1:05:35] what'd i tell y'all back in january
[1:05:38] let it out
[1:05:39] let it out you've got it bound so long
[1:05:42] let it out whatever it is evil or good
[1:05:45] it's going to one day whether you want
[1:05:47] to or not
[1:05:49] but i believe that you're afraid to turn
[1:05:52] it loose on works i believe that if you
[1:05:54] would just let your faith loose
[1:05:58] we've been taught right
[1:06:02] let's start using it
[1:06:04] start pouring it out
[1:06:06] sorry
[1:06:08] i'm sorry
[1:06:11] i'm sorry we'll get
[1:06:13] i got a i got a hold of this thing so
[1:06:15] big go along quote faith without works
[1:06:17] is dead in 1950 cleveland ohio
[1:06:21] if you'll go back they put these online
[1:06:22] so if you want to go back online and
[1:06:24] look that's a good message to listen to
[1:06:26] now watch
[1:06:29] at thy word 1953 now paul was justifying
[1:06:32] abraham by faith james justified him by
[1:06:34] words paul said abraham was justified
[1:06:36] romans 4 by faith and so james comes
[1:06:38] over
[1:06:39] and says that he was justified by works
[1:06:41] now both of them one confirmed the other
[1:06:43] not contradicted the bible never will
[1:06:47] contradict itself
[1:06:49] now both of them one confirmed the other
[1:06:51] now paul was speaking what god saw
[1:06:54] so today
[1:06:56] i want to see what god saw
[1:07:00] but i want the world to see what god saw
[1:07:03] in me
[1:07:04] everybody with me
[1:07:07] james is speaking what man saw his works
[1:07:10] and if you say i got faith in god and
[1:07:11] afraid to put your faith to work come on
[1:07:14] people and afraid to put your faith to
[1:07:17] work then it won't do you no good
[1:07:19] you've got to launch out
[1:07:22] that's what's the matter with the
[1:07:23] peoples today of this world many of them
[1:07:25] has faith but they're afraid to launch
[1:07:28] out with it
[1:07:30] you're just afraid to venture a little
[1:07:33] bit
[1:07:36] you hold it back
[1:07:39] somebody might one day want to speak in
[1:07:40] tongues let her out
[1:07:42] somebody maybe want to shout let it out
[1:07:46] make you feel good get it out
[1:07:49] just to say well i can i can do all
[1:07:52] things to christ who strengthens me
[1:07:55] amen
[1:07:57] number 10
[1:07:58] what is sin unbelief there's only two
[1:08:00] elements that control the human being
[1:08:02] that's either doubt or faith one or the
[1:08:04] other we've been talking about that but
[1:08:05] i want to confirm it you're possessed of
[1:08:08] one that dominates your life just
[1:08:10] depends on how much faith you have is
[1:08:12] how high you can rise
[1:08:13] dedication 1963 prophet said i would
[1:08:16] like to open that just a little bit for
[1:08:18] you
[1:08:19] if it be permissible you say sin is
[1:08:21] unbelief there's only two things two
[1:08:23] channels
[1:08:24] that you can live by one of them is
[1:08:26] faith the other one is unbelief
[1:08:28] he that believeth not is what condemned
[1:08:30] already smoking drinking committing
[1:08:32] adultery lying stealing carnal
[1:08:34] impersonations those things are
[1:08:36] attributes of unbelief
[1:08:38] if you was a believer you wouldn't do
[1:08:41] them
[1:08:42] no you do that because you're not a
[1:08:44] believer
[1:08:47] oh you say oh but i am a believer but by
[1:08:50] their fruits you shall know them see
[1:08:51] your actions speak louder than what your
[1:08:54] confession proves
[1:08:57] see when you disbelieve god's word and
[1:08:59] count it as something gone by there's
[1:09:01] well that was in the old testament it's
[1:09:03] still in the bible
[1:09:05] it says holy bible and that's pretty
[1:09:07] much covers from kevin to kevor
[1:09:09] all right when you disbelieve god's word
[1:09:11] and count it as something gone by or
[1:09:12] take some book instead and say this is
[1:09:15] just as good as that it goes to show
[1:09:17] that you're not a believer
[1:09:19] that's right you're not
[1:09:22] and if he was then you'd believe god's
[1:09:24] word
[1:09:25] he would express himself
[1:09:27] through his word
[1:09:29] now he was god's word expressed
[1:09:31] he said now if you can't believe me
[1:09:33] believe the work should i do listen
[1:09:35] jesus christ fulfilled every scripture
[1:09:37] that those
[1:09:39] pharisees and sadducees had rolled up in
[1:09:41] those scrolls
[1:09:42] he didn't deviate from he was the word
[1:09:46] the bible was written so that that man
[1:09:49] could walk on earth and show who he was
[1:09:52] and they turned him down they called him
[1:09:54] a devil
[1:09:58] so if you're god's word expressed today
[1:10:02] the world's gonna say oh you're all
[1:10:03] crazy y'all follow this man y'all in a
[1:10:05] cult yeah
[1:10:08] and it's true we are the only people
[1:10:10] who's lost our mind
[1:10:14] i believe that
[1:10:17] thank god
[1:10:20] i've lost my mind
[1:10:22] you've lost your mind
[1:10:24] yeah amen thank you thank you for
[1:10:26] noticing that
[1:10:29] search the scriptures from them you
[1:10:30] think you have eternal life and that's
[1:10:32] the very thing that tells who i am
[1:10:34] oh i wonder that's the one that says who
[1:10:36] i am the scripture tells who i am look
[1:10:38] and let me take that a little further
[1:10:39] will you
[1:10:41] everybody with me wake up just a little
[1:10:43] bit the scriptures is what tells what
[1:10:46] you are
[1:10:49] what you are
[1:10:51] that expresses you and expresses me the
[1:10:54] scriptures tell what we are
[1:10:57] it's so loud that our voice cannot even
[1:11:00] be heard
[1:11:01] our life speaks louder than our voice
[1:11:03] see and it's god's way of letting us see
[1:11:06] what we are
[1:11:08] god hiding himself in simplicity what
[1:11:10] sort of prophet let me get down to the
[1:11:11] bottom
[1:11:12] faith takes his final this is what we
[1:11:14] stopped at this morning faith takes his
[1:11:16] final resting place on the word of god
[1:11:17] nothing else not traditions of man not
[1:11:19] what this person said or what that
[1:11:21] person said
[1:11:22] faith takes his final resting place on
[1:11:24] the word of god
[1:11:26] there's where it finds this resting
[1:11:27] place you understand it's resting places
[1:11:30] on god's word so we're gonna put
[1:11:32] everything on god's word
[1:11:33] that's where noah rested he said what
[1:11:35] god said so
[1:11:37] that settled
[1:11:38] it perfect faith 1963 jesus had perfect
[1:11:42] faith he had it and it comes what
[1:11:44] because he was the word and as brother
[1:11:46] bob was talking about melchizedek i went
[1:11:48] to who is this melchizedek and i want
[1:11:50] you to understand something
[1:11:52] there's a lot of people believing here
[1:11:54] we go with a tradition of man that
[1:11:56] believe that jesus wasn't god to the
[1:11:58] river jordan that he was just a man and
[1:11:59] he walked and we've heard it right bob
[1:12:01] i'm not saying it
[1:12:02] we've heard it
[1:12:05] but
[1:12:05] who is this melchizedek totally explains
[1:12:07] it
[1:12:08] it says he was he came here the word
[1:12:11] we didn't we bypassed that part
[1:12:15] he came word watch spoken word
[1:12:18] we didn't we bypassed that
[1:12:22] but now we came to it though because he
[1:12:24] let us come in flesh and then now we
[1:12:26] have god
[1:12:28] right here and you become the word you
[1:12:30] become the word as you receive the word
[1:12:34] don't tell me you can sit home and watch
[1:12:36] everything in the world and read every
[1:12:37] kind of book in the world and not come
[1:12:39] to church and think that you've got the
[1:12:41] word of god
[1:12:42] you can't even know what to how to act
[1:12:48] if you abide in me and my words in you
[1:12:49] my words which this word abides in you
[1:12:51] then ask what you will and he'll be done
[1:12:53] for you
[1:12:53] if you say to this mountain be moved and
[1:12:55] don't doubt but believe in what you've
[1:12:57] said then you shall have what you said
[1:12:59] when you pray believe that you receive
[1:13:01] what you asked for
[1:13:03] space nothing else will ever change it
[1:13:06] don't try to change the word of god
[1:13:08] can't do it
[1:13:10] you know it's done it's already over
[1:13:12] with number 14 look 1963
[1:13:15] pharaoh did not have this potential he
[1:13:18] was offered it but refused it and when
[1:13:21] he review refused it then he couldn't
[1:13:23] focus
[1:13:25] now watch this
[1:13:26] no man
[1:13:28] after he's turned down the word of god
[1:13:30] listen no man after he's turned down the
[1:13:33] word of god can ever focus himself into
[1:13:35] it
[1:13:37] because you refuse the word that brings
[1:13:40] you into a relationship with christ oh
[1:13:42] i've got a relationship with christ and
[1:13:44] don't do what his word says
[1:13:50] really
[1:13:52] no man
[1:13:53] after he's turned down the word of god
[1:13:55] can ever focus itself into it because
[1:13:57] you refuse the word of god that brings
[1:13:59] you into a relationship with christ
[1:14:00] that's right
[1:14:01] but moses looked out of this window he
[1:14:03] believed it why moses looked by faith
[1:14:05] that's how moses looked now listen real
[1:14:07] close to this remark
[1:14:08] faith now don't forget to get this now
[1:14:10] so let's listen wake up
[1:14:12] faith is the sign this is what i was
[1:14:15] coming to this morning or this after
[1:14:17] first part of the sermon faith is
[1:14:19] designed to see what god wills and wants
[1:14:25] there's no knowledge that can do that
[1:14:28] faith alone is designed so god designed
[1:14:31] faith for you to understand the word of
[1:14:33] god put your faith your faith in it
[1:14:38] and then he'll give you that faith back
[1:14:41] so now it's your faith add to your faith
[1:14:45] faith alone is designed and give to the
[1:14:47] human race to find out what the will of
[1:14:49] god is
[1:14:51] and you take your faith that you got and
[1:14:53] it don't focus with the word then leave
[1:14:55] it alone you got the wrong faith
[1:14:58] but when your god-given faith focuses
[1:15:01] you with the word of god you're directly
[1:15:03] in line and zeroed
[1:15:06] oh my god help us this hour great hour
[1:15:08] that we live in faith designed to see
[1:15:10] what god wants
[1:15:12] how do you see it through the camera of
[1:15:14] his word his promise this is a full
[1:15:17] revelation
[1:15:18] of jesus christ that's pretty confident
[1:15:20] in it
[1:15:22] i'll read this right here and then we'll
[1:15:24] close
[1:15:25] only been an hour
[1:15:28] well for some of you 30 minutes you've
[1:15:29] been asleep together
[1:15:33] 1954
[1:15:34] faith cometh by hearing
[1:15:36] now
[1:15:37] i want you to listen this i'm going to
[1:15:38] read it real slow hope will agree with
[1:15:41] the bible everybody with me hope will
[1:15:43] agree with the bible
[1:15:45] now y'all don't read down any further
[1:15:47] stop that i see some of y'all reading
[1:15:49] stop it
[1:15:50] look watch this
[1:15:52] hope will say
[1:15:54] it's true
[1:15:58] hope will say i believe every bit of it
[1:16:00] oh sounded pretty good isn't it
[1:16:02] i believe that's the word of god and i
[1:16:04] believe that god will keep his promise
[1:16:06] hope believes all of it but hope says
[1:16:08] now i believe god will heal me but look
[1:16:10] at my condition
[1:16:13] you've lost the faith right there
[1:16:16] look at my condition
[1:16:19] now faith don't look at that
[1:16:21] faith comes around i don't care nothing
[1:16:23] about conditions
[1:16:25] god said so and it's mine
[1:16:28] you see faith burly
[1:16:30] as i once said faith has hair on his
[1:16:32] chest
[1:16:35] when it stands up and pulls his big
[1:16:36] muscles out everything else vanishes
[1:16:39] away
[1:16:40] just flies away when faith really takes
[1:16:42] a whole nothing else stands
[1:16:44] i'm telling you faith but you've got to
[1:16:47] but you've got to have hope and charity
[1:16:49] so you got to have these things bible
[1:16:51] says faith hope and charity right
[1:16:53] now look the prophet took them pulled
[1:16:54] them apart and showed you exactly what
[1:16:56] that bible was talking about
[1:16:57] if you've got real burly faith and no
[1:17:00] love with it you'll ruin your influence
[1:17:02] before the people
[1:17:05] all right so you gotta have charity you
[1:17:06] gotta have the new birth
[1:17:10] look
[1:17:11] you you'll ruin your influence before
[1:17:12] the people if you haven't got love mixed
[1:17:15] with it see you've seen people real
[1:17:17] burly what we would say excuse the
[1:17:19] expression of bulldog faith
[1:17:21] they said jack cole used to if somebody
[1:17:23] was you know had arthritis and they
[1:17:24] would bent over he just grabbed by the
[1:17:26] back he just
[1:17:27] jerked their back up you know or or
[1:17:30] whatever and you know slap them or beat
[1:17:32] them or something you know and
[1:17:33] they get healed well they put him in a
[1:17:35] jail for that too so
[1:17:37] but that's bulldog faith
[1:17:40] but watch brother branham now you know
[1:17:41] what he never did that
[1:17:44] he never jerked nobody he never knocked
[1:17:46] the hairpins out of some woman
[1:17:48] he pointed his finger at him
[1:17:50] or he'd pray for him by the shoulders
[1:17:52] he never did any of that
[1:17:54] you know why
[1:17:56] he was in control faith masters all
[1:17:59] circumstances
[1:18:02] then you
[1:18:03] did you see jesus ever do that jesus
[1:18:05] never grabbed nobody he never got
[1:18:06] nervous he never shouted at somebody
[1:18:07] except lazarus told him to come forth
[1:18:10] but other than that he just said satan
[1:18:12] go
[1:18:15] why because he mastered all
[1:18:16] circumstances
[1:18:20] bulldog faith to grab a hold but it's so
[1:18:22] rough but it's so rough with it then you
[1:18:24] see when you do that it hasn't got the
[1:18:27] kindness here to move with it brother
[1:18:29] brown said how do you cast out a demon
[1:18:31] what'd he say
[1:18:32] love
[1:18:34] love you love that person and you hate
[1:18:37] the
[1:18:38] demon hasn't got the kindness to move
[1:18:41] with it so what we need is hope faith
[1:18:43] and charity isn't that right hope faith
[1:18:46] and charity together god help our church
[1:18:48] to have it like that the people to have
[1:18:51] that combination so it takes a
[1:18:53] combination of faith it does take hope
[1:18:57] but don't stay hope
[1:19:00] my hope is built on nothing less than
[1:19:01] jesus blood and righteousness
[1:19:03] but you got to have faith faith and
[1:19:06] faith has no condition hope has a
[1:19:08] condition
[1:19:09] well i want to get healed but
[1:19:12] i want to have faith but
[1:19:14] but if you just rely on hope watch you
[1:19:17] hinder
[1:19:20] faith now hope looks for something
[1:19:24] way off
[1:19:26] but faith claims it right now
[1:19:31] see faith says god said so and it's mine
[1:19:34] that settles it i don't care if i'm
[1:19:36] still crippled i'm still blind if i'm
[1:19:39] still sick that don't have nothing to do
[1:19:41] with it
[1:19:43] amen freedom
[1:19:45] i believe it anyhow
[1:19:47] it's mine right now
[1:19:49] god says so and that settles it see
[1:19:51] that's faith
[1:19:53] but hope says god said so i'm expecting
[1:19:55] to get it someday
[1:19:58] that's what most of the world has is
[1:20:00] hope they have no faith
[1:20:02] i hope god's coming back i hope god can
[1:20:04] straighten out the united states i hope
[1:20:05] god just straightened out the politics i
[1:20:07] hope god can straighten out the world
[1:20:09] forget it
[1:20:11] you better have faith in god that he's
[1:20:13] gonna get you out of here
[1:20:19] i like what brother brown said you know
[1:20:20] the guy came by selling insurance to him
[1:20:22] and he's
[1:20:23] he said oh brother branham said he said
[1:20:25] i need to get you some insurance and he
[1:20:26] said well i've got insurance
[1:20:28] he said why he said his wife looked over
[1:20:31] at him you know like that happened
[1:20:33] knew he didn't have life insurance
[1:20:36] he said oh brother i said assurance
[1:20:39] he said well brother he said he said
[1:20:41] that won't help you when they put you in
[1:20:43] the ground he said yeah but that
[1:20:44] assurance will help me get out
[1:20:50] blessed assurance jesus is mine
[1:20:53] and as long as satan can put you off to
[1:20:55] another day see that's his tactic
[1:20:58] as long as he puts you off to another
[1:20:59] day that's as good as he wants he don't
[1:21:01] want you to disbelieve in god
[1:21:03] he just wants you to put it off
[1:21:06] to another day that's good as he wants
[1:21:07] that's right you'll never get it just
[1:21:09] believe that you got it right now it's
[1:21:12] your personal property
[1:21:14] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:21:16] for the evidence of things not seen is
[1:21:18] that right faith acts now it's positive
[1:21:21] there's no oh my i tell you sickness and
[1:21:23] everything else when faith steps in it's
[1:21:25] just like a snowball on a hot stove
[1:21:29] it ain't gonna last
[1:21:31] it just melts away everything goes away
[1:21:33] from faith because faith stands up and
[1:21:35] takes over rule when faith speaks
[1:21:38] everybody else
[1:21:40] keeps still
[1:21:42] is that your perfect man we'll stop
[1:21:44] right here musicians get ready to come
[1:21:45] oh come on you can't be born again
[1:21:47] without having faith
[1:21:49] that's right so you see on my chart here
[1:21:51] he's talking about the chart right here
[1:21:53] i got the very foundation faith is the
[1:21:56] foundation of all of it for without
[1:21:58] faith it's impossible to please god
[1:22:01] listen
[1:22:02] he that cometh to god must believe that
[1:22:04] he is and a rewarder of those that
[1:22:05] diligently seek him see he must be and
[1:22:08] when look when you are a skeptic of the
[1:22:11] bible
[1:22:13] when you are a skeptic of the word being
[1:22:15] right you just might as well stay back
[1:22:18] until first you believe it
[1:22:20] stay back
[1:22:22] what is sin unbelief there's only two
[1:22:24] elements he's done this is the third
[1:22:26] quote i'll give you that controls the
[1:22:28] human being that's either faith one or
[1:22:30] the other you're possessed of the one
[1:22:32] that dominates your life just depends on
[1:22:34] how much faith you have how high you can
[1:22:36] rise i expanded that quote a little bit
[1:22:38] but look but first
[1:22:40] it's got to be faith
[1:22:42] let me stay on that foundation for a
[1:22:43] while now faith is what you must believe
[1:22:46] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:22:47] for it's look you already have it when
[1:22:50] you have faith because it's revealed in
[1:22:52] faith faith is the substance of things
[1:22:54] hoped for
[1:22:55] see the evidence what is it what kind of
[1:22:57] an evidence
[1:22:59] a holy evidence
[1:23:01] now look again now faith does the rest
[1:23:03] of it faith does the rest so you must
[1:23:04] have faith for a foundation
[1:23:07] all christianity
[1:23:11] all christianity
[1:23:14] all you are
[1:23:15] all you'll ever be
[1:23:17] is based upon what faith in the word
[1:23:20] not faith in the man not faith in the
[1:23:22] building not faith in the government
[1:23:24] faith in the word that's the reason i
[1:23:27] believe
[1:23:28] the word then we're going to start right
[1:23:30] there next time
[1:23:31] have faith and be born again that's
[1:23:34] laying your foundation
[1:23:36] got to lay that right foundation before
[1:23:38] you can build a good house
[1:23:40] if not your foundation will fail if
[1:23:42] you're built on sinking sin if you build
[1:23:44] on man's ideas
[1:23:46] we're not built on man's ideas
[1:23:49] we're built on the word of god
[1:23:51] you love the lord
[1:23:52] let's sing a song
[1:23:53] all i want to do is love you
[1:23:56] all

[1:26:34] on the
[1:26:36] [Music]
[1:26:45] i know
[1:26:47] [Music]
[1:27:02] all i want to do is love him
[1:27:04] he loved me first
[1:27:07] he loved me before the foundation of the
[1:27:08] world he just knew i'd love him when i
[1:27:10] got here
[1:27:11] amen
[1:27:12] he's got enough love for the whole world
[1:27:14] all seven billion people and all the
[1:27:16] ones that are in the grave
[1:27:18] but only a certain group of people is
[1:27:20] going to take it
[1:27:22] amen i'm sorry i mean it's just a free
[1:27:24] moral agency choice
[1:27:26] to choose
[1:27:28] you this day
[1:27:29] who you'll
[1:27:30] serve there's only two masters there's
[1:27:33] only satan or god
[1:27:35] there's no in between there's no
[1:27:36] tweeners
[1:27:38] you either love god and serve him or you
[1:27:40] love the devil and serve him and it will
[1:27:42] manifest itself this is manifesting time
[1:27:44] this is not something where you can
[1:27:46] hide and keep going all of a sudden
[1:27:49] something's going to be revealed and
[1:27:51] it's going to be revealed who you are i
[1:27:52] want you to make sure your conscious is
[1:27:54] right
[1:27:55] make sure your soul is right
[1:27:57] that's why i love that song it is well
[1:27:59] with my soul it may not be well with my
[1:28:00] spirit it may not be well with my body
[1:28:04] but is it well with your soul
[1:28:06] do you know that you know that you know
[1:28:09] do you know that when you walk out of
[1:28:10] this building if you get killed in a car
[1:28:12] wreck or something happens that that
[1:28:15] that we'll see you again
[1:28:17] coming out of that six dimension
[1:28:19] coming out of the grave
[1:28:21] so then what are we worried about
[1:28:24] what are we worried about
[1:28:26] that's why i said he's not giving us
[1:28:28] he's not giving us what fear
[1:28:31] god if you're fearful of something god
[1:28:34] did not give that to you
[1:28:38] now we don't fear god like that either
[1:28:40] the fear of god is the beginning of
[1:28:42] wisdom so if you you know how we know
[1:28:44] how to fear god we know how to be
[1:28:45] reverent to god
[1:28:47] it's like brother ryan said he said i
[1:28:48] don't fear that you know god's gonna
[1:28:50] just be a hateful arrogant something to
[1:28:53] beat me up no that's what the devil does
[1:28:55] but he's gonna he's gonna whip me with
[1:28:57] nail scarred hands
[1:29:00] if i need it
[1:29:02] he'll give me a little smack every once
[1:29:04] in a while but you know why he does
[1:29:06] because you're his child
[1:29:09] because you know what if you're a
[1:29:10] bastard child he he can't he can't help
[1:29:12] you he's not going to help you but if
[1:29:14] you're his children
[1:29:15] the trial of our faith
[1:29:18] being much more precious than gold that
[1:29:20] perishes
[1:29:21] the trial of your faith
[1:29:23] i want us all to
[1:29:25] lift it up and let it out
[1:29:27] like brother ryan said
[1:29:30] let it let it loose
[1:29:32] let it loose
[1:29:33] loose him
[1:29:34] and let him go that's what he said to
[1:29:36] lazarus he was still bound up when he
[1:29:38] come out of the grave hello somebody he
[1:29:40] was still bound up
[1:29:41] he was alive but he was still bound up
[1:29:44] right
[1:29:46] but when jesus said loose him
[1:29:48] and let him go
[1:29:52] come the shackles off
[1:29:54] here he come out a whole man after being
[1:29:56] dead for four days
[1:29:58] lord he stinketh
[1:30:00] jesus is like forget your circumstances
[1:30:04] i hope
[1:30:06] i hope
[1:30:07] nope he said i am
[1:30:10] the resurrection in the life
[1:30:12] and that same god there's another air
[1:30:15] and joint air
[1:30:17] because you know what
[1:30:19] there's going to come a day
[1:30:21] somebody's going to be standing in a
[1:30:22] pulpit
[1:30:24] and somebody's going to say death
[1:30:27] leave this place
[1:30:29] you have no hold on me and then all the
[1:30:31] dead saints are going to come walking in
[1:30:33] the room
[1:30:34] don't need to open the door for them
[1:30:36] because they're already in glorified
[1:30:37] bodies
[1:30:38] so you won't need you don't need to lock
[1:30:40] up something to try to keep them out you
[1:30:42] can't keep god out with a lock
[1:30:44] so they're going to come walking through
[1:30:46] the walls and we're going to know one
[1:30:47] thing's for sure
[1:30:48] the rapture's on
[1:30:50] the resurrection has happened and
[1:30:51] something's going to click and you're
[1:30:53] going to say oh my
[1:30:56] well i looked at my hands
[1:30:59] and my hands were new
[1:31:02] and i looked let me say brother jose at
[1:31:04] my feet
[1:31:06] and they were too

[1:31:11] won't it be a time
[1:31:13] talking with the angels they don't even
[1:31:15] know what you're talking about when you
[1:31:16] talk about redemption they're like
[1:31:20] but you were lost one time
[1:31:22] that's why i love that song of
[1:31:24] redemption
[1:31:25] the angels all will listen for they
[1:31:28] cannot join that song the bible says you
[1:31:30] sing a new song it's a song nobody knows
[1:31:33] anything about if you're not born again
[1:31:35] you can't sing a redemption song but man
[1:31:37] if we are born again
[1:31:39] talk about able to sing a redemption
[1:31:41] song
[1:31:42] i once was lost in sin
[1:31:45] but jesus took me in
[1:31:47] then a little i from heaven what filled
[1:31:49] my soul
[1:31:51] he bathed my heart in love
[1:31:54] we know that he wrote our name before
[1:31:56] the foundation of the world but he wrote
[1:31:58] my name above
[1:32:00] just a little talk with jesus
[1:32:02] makes it right let's bow our heads
[1:32:05] lord i pray this number one you be with
[1:32:07] brother aaron on wednesday night lord
[1:32:08] that bring the words to his father that

[1:32:16] what we have inside of us father
[1:32:19] that lord we can give you the praise and
[1:32:21] honor and glory for all things you give
[1:32:22] us all these gifts of faith and of
[1:32:24] healing and of speaking in tongues and
[1:32:26] of wisdom and all the different things
[1:32:27] lord i pray that with all nine spiritual
[1:32:29] gifts lord that they'll become working
[1:32:31] in our midst father you said we could

[1:32:48] do
[1:32:49] and father we pray and thank you that
[1:32:51] you give us a prophet that we were able
[1:32:53] to see that that he was not god but a
[1:32:55] mouthpiece just like other mouthpieces
[1:32:57] have been paul irenaeus martin different
[1:32:59] ones columbia even john smith even
[1:33:01] dwight moody and the different ones lord
[1:33:03] they were your mouthpiece at a certain
[1:33:05] time but we had a major prophet come in
[1:33:07] the end time
[1:33:08] and he gave us
[1:33:09] the correct
[1:33:11] interpretation of the word of god that
[1:33:13] comes straight from you father come
[1:33:15] straight from the author there was not
[1:33:17] man's ideas mixed in

[1:38:52] school okay brother gary get one for
[1:38:54] luke yep if y'all got grandkids
[1:38:58] yes sir
[1:39:00] anybody else
[1:39:02] now this is for school
[1:39:04] all right
[1:39:05] this is for going to school
[1:39:07] and
[1:39:08] we're going to pray listen i know it's
[1:39:10] tough on kids
[1:39:11] we see all this bullying
[1:39:13] and and then here we've got our sisters
[1:39:15] that are that are dressed different
[1:39:17] and they act different
[1:39:19] and and sometimes i know when um
[1:39:23] joyce
[1:39:25] hey joyce when when joyce and we were
[1:39:27] all going to school it wasn't really
[1:39:29] that bad right joyce it wasn't because
[1:39:31] because we were in that transition time
[1:39:33] between and like i said before when i
[1:39:36] was a young man a young boy
[1:39:39] most women wore dresses you didn't see
[1:39:41] hardly any pantsuits or and you
[1:39:44] definitely didn't see one
[1:39:45] and get ace and and ensley
[1:39:48] i'll get one all right
[1:39:52] okay
[1:39:55] how many
[1:39:57] two yep okay
[1:39:59] yes sir
[1:40:00] okay
[1:40:01] uh-huh all right
[1:40:05] all right
[1:40:06] but when we was growing up it you know
[1:40:08] you
[1:40:09] women wore dresses and
[1:40:12] didn't have any of these pant suits and
[1:40:13] stuff so so like that's what i'm saying
[1:40:15] with joyce and us it wasn't so much that
[1:40:17] it was in that transition period so she
[1:40:20] wasn't ridiculed as much as maybe you
[1:40:22] guys are now because
[1:40:24] they wear whatever to school now
[1:40:27] tighter the better
[1:40:29] the more showing the better
[1:40:32] i mean it's just the morals of the of
[1:40:34] the world has gone to the pot but i want
[1:40:36] y'all to uplift that moral take that mor
[1:40:38] the moral the moral standard that you
[1:40:40] live by let it be different
[1:40:44] right
[1:40:45] martin luther
[1:40:48] pin your book bag
[1:41:00] everybody got that
[1:41:04] and it'll stay in there all year and you
[1:41:05] ain't got to wash it you're not going to
[1:41:07] wash the anointing off of it
[1:41:09] right
[1:41:10] but just believe that god's going to be
[1:41:12] here to help us like i said before it's
[1:41:13] going to be tough it's a big transition
[1:41:14] some of you are going from grammar
[1:41:16] school to high school
[1:41:18] some of you going from high school to
[1:41:19] college but you know what god can be
[1:41:22] with you
[1:41:23] if you ask him to
[1:41:25] now don't take these prayer calls in the
[1:41:27] neck like the devil
[1:41:29] okay
[1:41:30] i'm sorry
[1:41:33] martin luther
[1:41:34] the whole world's against you
[1:41:37] martin luther said i want the world to
[1:41:38] know i'm against the world
[1:41:41] amen because he was against the catholic
[1:41:43] system that covered the whole world and
[1:41:46] when he came out of that thing they said
[1:41:47] martin luther said man you're i mean you
[1:41:49] know you're
[1:41:52] by the grace of god somebody didn't kill
[1:41:53] him
[1:41:54] actually because they didn't mind
[1:41:56] killing people who didn't believe in the
[1:41:57] catholic doctrine by the crusades that
[1:41:59] they had
[1:42:00] but let's pray that they'll have a good
[1:42:01] time they won't be bullied that
[1:42:03] everybody be fine and have a good time
[1:42:06] and you know what have good grades
[1:42:08] i saw where brother brown said one time
[1:42:10] that he prayed for sarah yeah sarah was
[1:42:12] gonna have a test and he said we went in
[1:42:14] and prayed and said she had a good she
[1:42:15] had a good test score
[1:42:17] he said oh god yeah
