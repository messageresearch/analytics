[5:11] scripture that we refer to here is the
[5:14] scripture brother Branham gave in the in
[5:16] the in the sermon broken cisterns and I
[5:20] want a got a little idea I want to talk
[5:23] about and it's about you know just funny
[5:26] finding out where we draw our energy or
[5:30] power from where we where we can tap
[5:33] into and receive life and you know going
[5:37] through a little testimony of what
[5:40] happened to me there you know as I went
[5:43] and I I never I didn't brother the
[5:47] brother Billy Canada but Joseph
[5:52] explained to me that nowadays
[5:55] everything's electronically controlled
[5:58] nowadays your power grid and all this
[6:01] stuff is he like trying to be controlled
[6:03] you can stand here with your iPhone and
[6:05] adjust the temperature in your house you
[6:07] can stand here and your and turn off the
[6:10] lights on some houses you know and and
[6:11] things like that well and Timothy told
[6:15] me he says you know I had a he says
[6:18] they're actually showing me how much
[6:20] power I'm using you know I said well I
[6:23] can't put in the main the main breaker
[6:26] if I don't if I have power they're a
[6:28] little shocked me I said so
[6:30] I'm gonna remove the meter and quickly
[6:32] put it back on after I get it on
[6:34] no sooner did I do that and we ran for a
[6:38] main breaker but then we got back it was
[6:40] red-tagged
[6:41] oh no what are we gonna do so what are
[6:46] we gonna do now how are we gonna get the
[6:48] power back on you know we're gonna have
[6:49] to call it electrician we're gonna have
[6:50] to do a lot of things to get all squared
[6:53] away
[6:54] so nervous as I was I went ahead and
[6:57] started putting the box on and then
[6:58] Timothy says you know what it's it's
[7:00] fuel you're you're gonna we're gonna
[7:02] have to call her electrician we're gonna
[7:04] have to go through a lot of things
[7:05] you're trying to get this grandfathered
[7:07] in and it's not gonna grandfather it now
[7:09] gives you you're gonna have to put
[7:11] everything new and they're gonna go
[7:12] through the whole house and do have to
[7:14] do fix everything
[7:15] so I was nervous and I I worked a little
[7:18] while on and I says you know what let's
[7:19] just go home
[7:21] so I left the power box there and the
[7:24] main breaker on and I says well call in
[7:28] the morning and find out what it's gonna
[7:30] take to get the power on we'll have to
[7:32] hire an electrician
[7:33] I guess well during the night I was
[7:36] nervous I couldn't sleep and now I was
[7:38] just starting to finally fell asleep and
[7:40] I had a dream and in this dream my
[7:44] pastor's friend came over this is
[7:47] interesting about how pasture is you
[7:51] know that you can you you know you
[7:52] realize you can call on your pasture and
[7:55] you know there's a little story about
[7:59] Hannah Hannah in the Bible Hannah and
[8:03] the Bible was there was a man named Eli
[8:05] who wasn't even a good pasture wasn't
[8:08] even a good priest he wasn't taken he
[8:11] wasn't control you know taking care of
[8:13] the house of the Lord he was he was
[8:15] actually putting a blind eye to what his
[8:19] kids were doing and not taking him off
[8:21] the priesthood and all this stuff he was
[8:23] just and and the Lord required it of him
[8:26] but yet a little girl named Hannah comes
[8:28] up and she's praying asking God to have
[8:32] a baby and she he gets up there and he
[8:35] accuses her of being drunken and she
[8:38] says don't don't don't accuse me of that
[8:40] kind of thing I'm crying out to the Lord
[8:41] and he is coming he is comment one
[8:46] little comment that he made was made
[8:48] Lord give you what you're asking and she
[8:51] turned around and went home could see
[8:54] the baby and had the baby
[8:56] what was that it's respect respect for
[9:01] the office respect for the office and
[9:05] the power of God can move through there
[9:07] whether you agree with the man or not
[9:09] respect him and you'll find out God's
[9:11] Park you move through there so you watch
[9:14] so nevertheless the office so I had a
[9:18] dream about my pastor in here and and
[9:20] and one of his friends who was an
[9:23] inspector elect electrical inspector in
[9:26] New Mexico in the dream was standing
[9:29] there and he says no he says just go
[9:33] ahead and hook up the way you were
[9:34] planning to in the dream go ahead and
[9:37] hook it all up the way you're planning
[9:38] to and and I'll get the power turned to
[9:42] back on for you I says oh wow I wake up
[9:46] and ice is all Lord if it was only so
[9:48] how could this happen you know if it was
[9:50] only so so I don't know what Tim said to
[9:54] the power people and I don't know what
[9:56] but all of sudden he calls up and he
[9:57] says they're gonna find this a hundred
[9:59] bucks okay that's not bad and twenty
[10:03] bucks to come and put it back on okay
[10:06] and they're gonna hook it up with no
[10:10] questions asked what no electrician or
[10:15] nothing so I'm there I got up early in
[10:19] the morning couldn't sleep early in the
[10:20] morning I got up there and I was already
[10:22] putting the thing together and he calls
[10:24] up and you know about four hours later
[10:25] and tells me this so I just finished
[10:27] hooking everything I've got the power
[10:29] box up already we're ready to go the
[10:31] people people came up drove up put the
[10:33] meter back in power went on I turned the
[10:36] switches all on they all work great and
[10:38] no questions as well praise the Lord you
[10:43] know and then I realized the scripture
[10:45] says the footsteps of the righteous are
[10:47] ordered of the Lord so you know I'm not
[10:50] trying to do anything illegal but I'm
[10:53] only trying to you know I'm trying to
[10:55] get my son up and going so I'm glad that
[10:59] the Lord's mindful of us you know that
[11:01] just really really realized that you
[11:03] know so so the Lord's been merciful to
[11:07] me and I'm so grateful amen
[11:09] and so going back to the scripture we're
[11:12] talking about and and what we're looking
[11:14] at is you know when we when we see that
[11:17] you know it rains a lot here I had
[11:18] noticed that it's been raining and you
[11:21] know we always praise God showers of
[11:23] blessings amen and inside where the Holy
[11:26] Spirit moves we receive showers of
[11:29] blessings and it's still a blessing to
[11:31] us
[11:31] amen as the Holy Spirit moves like I
[11:33] heard in the song service as the power
[11:35] of God moves through here I realize
[11:37] they're showers of blessings but when
[11:39] brother Branham was talking about broken
[11:41] cisterns he's talking about the places
[11:44] like New Mexico it doesn't rain very
[11:45] much and out there in New Mexico since
[11:48] it doesn't rain very much they take and
[11:50] they use big old sometimes that you
[11:54] can't be driving through the wilderness
[11:56] and in order to feed the deer and the
[11:58] elk water they'll put a roof tin roof
[12:02] and they'll leading it all down and
[12:04] they'll put gutters on this roof it's no
[12:06] more than this high and you walked up to
[12:09] it and you say well what is this thing
[12:10] and it's just a tin roof and they have a
[12:13] gutter on it and it runs to a little
[12:15] tank and you walk over to the tank and
[12:18] the elk have been there there's a lot of
[12:20] track around it the up tube in there
[12:21] drinking water and animals have been
[12:23] drinking water there and and sometimes
[12:26] if it's raining enough it overflows but
[12:28] almost never overflowing but they drink
[12:31] out of there and you know notice that
[12:33] that it's pretty it's pretty nasty water
[12:38] and brother Brown explains that in their
[12:40] broken sisters tape eating bowls on
[12:42] telling you how you know they they would
[12:45] put a filter on this thing coming off
[12:48] the barn roof and of course the barn the
[12:50] cattle cattle running though in the barn
[12:52] when yours in the barn and they step and
[12:55] dust comes up at dry seasons the dust
[12:57] comes up and settles on the roof then
[12:59] the rain washes it all down into the
[13:01] cistern and people go in there to get
[13:03] there they're cooking water and they're
[13:05] in their water for drinking and their
[13:06] water for cleaning and all that out of
[13:08] the cistern because there's no real well
[13:12] made
[13:13] they're there they're saving water as
[13:15] much as they can and he says sure they
[13:19] can filter out the bugs and stuff but
[13:21] but where does the bug juices go you
[13:24] know after and I've seen I've seen a lot
[13:28] of bugs have been laying in the water a
[13:29] long time pretty soon there's hardly any
[13:31] bug and mostly juice you know so it gets
[13:35] to be where and Bradley Brown types all
[13:37] this stuff as the denominational system
[13:39] and he says you know what it's all going
[13:41] to be the mark of the beast and I was
[13:43] listening to another tape where brother
[13:46] Brown was talking a little bit about the
[13:47] mark of the beast and he said that that
[13:51] all those demons and this was in the in
[13:56] the tape Feast of the trumpets he says
[14:01] all those demons that were bound up in
[14:03] the river Euphrates he says those demons
[14:06] came back to in this day and age and
[14:10] anointed Hitler with that Roman system
[14:14] when they're killing Christians and
[14:15] actually went in after the Jews and I
[14:18] thought wow I said so all these demons
[14:21] were loosed upon the upon the world and
[14:25] and and and they came in after the
[14:28] attitude control control the the they
[14:32] came in and did the same thing they were
[14:33] doing to the Christians well they were
[14:35] putting him to death and they were
[14:36] killing off the Jews but then I started
[14:39] thinking a little bit about the you know
[14:41] when when when every time that you find
[14:44] out that when somebody gets this kind of
[14:49] influence or this kind of energy or that
[14:52] kind of power that comes out there's a
[14:54] move you know you're this move that came
[14:57] through there's a there's a power to
[15:00] resist it brother branham brother Dale
[15:03] was talking about the powers that were
[15:05] resisting all the Satan's powers that he
[15:09] put forth in the seals okay and you
[15:12] start to see that this this energy that
[15:16] came out there the time of the of the
[15:19] sixth seal you find out that they were
[15:21] they were killing the Jews and and
[15:24] and yet there there was there was a
[15:27] resistance there a power to resist and
[15:30] which which it didn't ended up moving
[15:33] over that same power had to move over to
[15:36] where it was you know when Hitler's
[15:39] wasn't what Hitler lost the battle and
[15:41] all and all that the demons didn't die
[15:44] they still moved over and brother Brown
[15:46] called it that they moved over to the
[15:48] clergy and the clergy was moving over to
[15:51] it a denominational system and that
[15:53] denominational system is still that old
[15:56] stagnant water that's coming from an old
[15:59] cistern where they're trying to and and
[16:03] and what does it do it kind of attracts
[16:05] wiggle tails in it and and it attracts
[16:07] frogs and it attracts tadpoles and
[16:09] salamanders and all these kind of things
[16:12] that that are attracted to stagnant
[16:14] waters and you find out that the the
[16:16] world is all moving towards this power
[16:21] that's that these powers that be and
[16:24] you'll start just notice that you know
[16:26] if you notice in the politics around
[16:29] when you notice all the politicians and
[16:32] the things that they're trying to
[16:33] influence they're trying to push towards
[16:35] the one world system though and you
[16:38] start to say well you know what we do
[16:40] have like you say there they were all
[16:43] excited about the about the y2k thing
[16:47] and saying oh everything's gonna shut
[16:49] down and we better have generators and
[16:51] this and that and you start to find out
[16:53] that hey there's a truth to it but yet
[16:56] there's not a truth to it nobody had to
[17:00] go have all these generators and things
[17:01] but there the truth is is electronically
[17:04] they're watching where you're spending
[17:06] your money they're watching where your
[17:08] credit card is pushed you know my wife
[17:11] gets us a signal every time I spend a
[17:15] dollar you know so she gets it on her
[17:18] phone nice as well I says you're
[17:20] watching me rather close and and I says
[17:23] well it doesn't matter I says I'm not
[17:25] afraid I shamed or afraid for her to
[17:27] know where where I'm spending my money
[17:29] but the thing is it's very very subtle
[17:33] but really quick to respond and you
[17:36] start to notice that
[17:38] in this day and age we live in they're
[17:40] gonna know where you're at what you're
[17:41] doing yeah you you you can't just get
[17:44] off the grid and you find out that there
[17:47] that there's a if you're going to if
[17:49] you're going to have any kind of a
[17:54] chance you know when the squeeze comes
[17:57] on they're good they'll know where
[17:59] you're at so the only place that you can
[18:02] find any relief from the from the the
[18:06] powers that are out there is sheltered
[18:09] when you're sheltered you know I had a
[18:12] friend one time they said III all right
[18:15] as soon as I get my check I take it all
[18:17] in cash that way they can't follow me
[18:19] they can't trace me I got it all in cash
[18:22] so and and and they says well you know
[18:25] and I don't use a credit card and I
[18:27] don't use that and I don't use that so
[18:29] they get so they can't follow me and
[18:30] they can't trace where I'm at what I'm
[18:32] doing I says why are you so worried
[18:35] about Big Brother Isis if you're looking
[18:38] if you're looking to to to get off the
[18:41] grid if you're looking to to to be a you
[18:46] know there's a friend of mine that that
[18:50] says well we at the time of Obama he was
[18:53] saving gun saving bullets and saving and
[18:56] getting getting guns stocked up and
[18:58] everything he says I got I'm gonna run
[19:00] up to the woods and be in a militia if
[19:03] in case if in case this guy goes too
[19:05] radical I says you know some people they
[19:10] take these scriptures and the things
[19:12] that God has said is gonna be and they
[19:15] take it so carnal that they don't
[19:18] recognize any of the truth that's gone
[19:20] in in our day and age they if they'd
[19:23] only had the message they only have the
[19:25] truth that's coming our day and age we
[19:27] the privileged people have been drinking
[19:29] from the fountain of life we've been
[19:32] we've been acknowledging the the massive
[19:35] message of this hour that the truth that
[19:38] God's given us in our day and age and we
[19:40] start to look and we start to see that
[19:44] in the word when we look at the word
[19:47] when we look at the way nations are
[19:51] going and how the
[19:52] how the powers of God are going you look
[19:58] at there I was I was looking at
[20:00] revelations 13 11 the mark of the beast
[20:03] let's go over there real quick and
[20:09] actually I was reading where it refers
[20:12] to America in Revelations 11 and I have
[20:17] a year it says religious it says and I
[20:30] beheld another beast came up out of the
[20:34] earth and it and he had two horns like a
[20:39] lamb but spake as the dragon and we know
[20:43] the dragon is Rome so brother Brown
[20:46] called that the USA the United States is
[20:48] coming into a power now we start to
[20:51] worry wonder where is we recognize that
[20:54] in this in the sixth seal when I'm in
[20:57] the sixth seal when the persecution came
[20:59] on the Jews that those spirits were
[21:02] released where are they today they're
[21:05] still they're still here but now it's
[21:07] become a power where there's a uniting
[21:10] time amongst the the world to get
[21:13] everybody into a war one world system
[21:15] and we realize that as Christians we
[21:19] have to be in Christ Jesus drinking from
[21:21] the fountain of life to be able to
[21:24] recognize that that that the the things
[21:27] that God has prophesied in our day and
[21:29] age are bringing us to a place where we
[21:33] can be a people of faith bringing us to
[21:36] a place where we can recognize who we
[21:38] are and what we're standing for you know
[21:40] we looked at the at some of the
[21:42] prophecies the self-driving car they've
[21:46] already got the self-driving car they I
[21:48] think the the what does that call the
[21:52] the electric car that's now out there
[21:55] that has an option where you can just
[21:58] take your hands off the wheel and it'll
[22:00] go almost down the street what's the
[22:02] name of the car the Tesla can already go
[22:05] down this
[22:06] streets without driving without holding
[22:08] your hands on a car and holding your
[22:11] hands on the steering wheel they still
[22:12] require you to sit at the seat but let
[22:15] you can let the car drive itself and the
[22:18] Google card they're saying that the new
[22:21] Google cars and several of the cars
[22:22] coming up aren't even going to have a
[22:24] steering wheel you can put your back
[22:26] towards what that seat can be turned
[22:28] away from the steering wheel area
[22:29] they'll be there that they're being
[22:31] tested in several places and uber I
[22:35] think is already using the this
[22:38] technology to to pick up and and drop
[22:42] off people and on their rentals so you
[22:45] start to see that the the the the
[22:49] self-driving car may be that it's not
[22:52] shaped like an egg maybe one question
[22:54] but you start to see that the technology
[22:56] is there so we start to see that hey
[22:59] this day we sit here and say that
[23:03] scripture is fulfilled in our day when
[23:06] we see it when we got a chance to see
[23:08] that well another thing I saw that went
[23:11] you know back when when when Israel
[23:13] became a nation when Israel became a
[23:17] nation and Israel took back over
[23:19] Jerusalem it caused me to just hunger
[23:23] and thirst I went through Daniels 70
[23:25] weeks again I wanted I wanted to know
[23:27] what what time we're living in I thought
[23:29] the coming of Lord I thought those bombs
[23:31] were gonna fly in the last vision that
[23:33] Billy Brown was talking about because I
[23:35] knew that I work in Los Alamos where
[23:37] they're making these things so I really
[23:41] thought that we were coming at the end
[23:42] end of it all at that time I didn't work
[23:45] there but I ended up working there but
[23:47] you see we start to look and we start to
[23:50] see that almighty God's Word is coming
[23:53] to pass
[23:54] step by step whether we whether we put
[23:58] our efforts to it no matter what we do
[24:01] we can turn a blind eye to it it still
[24:03] comes to pass the Word of God is going
[24:05] to come to pass and in when we start to
[24:09] look at at the work at how God Almighty
[24:14] God was is going to manifest himself in
[24:17] our day and age
[24:19] when we start to look at our our part to
[24:21] play in this economy of God when we
[24:24] start to look at where we are we can see
[24:26] where the denominations are going we can
[24:29] see where the where the prophecies are
[24:31] heading we can see where the where the
[24:33] where the the the Word of God is taking
[24:37] but we start to look taking taking the
[24:41] the world but we start to look at
[24:43] where's the Word of God taking us as a
[24:45] people as a people that believe the
[24:48] message of this hour
[24:50] what's the Word of God taking us to well
[24:53] how can we how can we be the the people
[24:56] of faith how can we have the faith that
[24:59] was once delivered to the Saints we
[25:02] start to realize our part to play is to
[25:04] believe God how can we have faith in God
[25:08] you know you know Moses when he was
[25:15] standing there at the at the Brinks of
[25:18] the Red Sea that people were saying well
[25:20] the soldiers are coming after us let's
[25:22] just deliver Moses to him so that so you
[25:25] know so that they'll spare us they're
[25:27] already talking about delivering Moses
[25:29] to the Egyptians throw him out there in
[25:31] the front of them you know so that they
[25:34] won't kill us all and we'll go back and
[25:35] serve the Egyptians as slaves you know
[25:38] take the leader and just throw him out
[25:40] there and Moses says you know they're
[25:43] talking about these things that he got
[25:45] over there behind the rock and he
[25:47] started to pray and and let's go over to
[25:50] Exodus 14
[25:51] I think it's 14 15 and Moses stood there
[26:01] it says all right and the Lord said unto
[26:05] Moses for for cras thou unto me speak
[26:09] unto the children of Israel that they go
[26:12] forward but lift up your rod and stretch
[26:17] out thy hand over the sea and divide it
[26:23] and and the children of Israel shall go
[26:27] on dry ground through the midst of the
[26:31] sea
[26:32] you see we as message believers now your
[26:39] Moses you're like Moses you know well
[26:42] you come to the place where you start to
[26:44] realize you know I have a commission
[26:47] here you know God's called me to a work
[26:51] God's called you to a work God's called
[26:55] you to a work to believe what he said
[26:57] God's called you you said well oh I try
[27:01] to get up in the morning and all my feet
[27:03] ache oh I get crabs on bruised I'm
[27:06] hurting III I'm struggling you know all
[27:09] day just it's hard you know
[27:12] old age is rough don't get old you young
[27:15] kids yeah you know and you start to
[27:19] realize you know what I get up in the
[27:22] morning yeah it hurts my feet hurt my
[27:25] legs hurt my shoulders hurt my arms hurt
[27:27] sometimes I sleep and I'm waking up with
[27:30] her yeah but you know what I I wake up
[27:35] and I said Lord you gave Joshua the
[27:39] opportunity of coming into old age and
[27:41] never losing an ounce of his strength
[27:43] and I believe the same things given to
[27:46] me as bright as your bride I believe
[27:48] your words calling me to a higher
[27:50] calling I believe it's letting me wrecks
[27:53] perience but I can believe and I can
[27:58] have I can pray and I can ask God Lord I
[28:01] don't believe the pain and by golly I'll
[28:04] get up whether it hurts or not you know
[28:06] I'll go I'll twist that muscle whether
[28:09] it's got the strength or not you know
[28:12] while back I was working on David's
[28:14] house my boys house over there in in in
[28:17] New Mexico and for some reason I started
[28:20] noticing that my arms are just losing
[28:22] strength and I didn't have no muscle
[28:24] anymore my muscles were gone and this is
[28:28] what's going on you know why is my
[28:30] muscles disappearing and stuff and I'm
[28:32] getting weaker and weaker and weaker and
[28:35] I come up to that three story I mean
[28:38] it's a it's a two-story house with with
[28:41] the pitch the roof so I get to that
[28:43] pitch of that roof and I look up there
[28:44] and there's like
[28:45] six or about three scaffolds for
[28:48] scaffolds hi and I says I gotta get up
[28:51] there I don't got no muscle to get up
[28:54] there my arms are weak so I grab hold of
[28:57] the scaffolding one two three four and
[29:01] then it i forgot this i forgot back up
[29:07] again so you say well where did your
[29:10] strength come from I don't know I
[29:12] believe it's from God whether I have it
[29:16] or not I'll use it because I believe God
[29:18] promised me that I can be whole well ho
[29:23] wholesome amen so I I I forced myself up
[29:28] and down that ladder and you know what
[29:31] eventually I started noticing my arms
[29:34] are coming back my arms are coming back
[29:37] but my strength did not leave me you say
[29:39] why because I have faith that's why I
[29:42] didn't go to no doctor I didn't go to
[29:44] check up on anything but I believe I
[29:47] don't have to drink from any broken
[29:48] cistern I can't believe I can believe
[29:50] that I can drink from that fountain of
[29:53] life I can drink from the Word of God
[29:55] that has promised me exceeded and
[29:59] precious promises it promises me my
[30:02] strength if I can see that Joshua at it
[30:04] I can have it all the way if I go by way
[30:08] of the grave I'll have it or I go by way
[30:10] of the change of the body I'll still
[30:14] have it
[30:14] amen so excuse me so I recognize you
[30:21] know that that that the Commission I
[30:23] have the Commission this bride has it's
[30:26] not to lay our and play dead you know
[30:30] the first church age that had to go into
[30:34] the ground yeah they had to go into the
[30:37] ground that was prophesied of them they
[30:39] had to give their lives but this last
[30:43] church age isn't going to do that she's
[30:46] got a third full ministry it's a
[30:48] different calling it's a different truth
[30:52] it's a different promise and we have a
[30:54] promise to be the Bride of Christ that
[30:57] by faith can
[30:58] at the word of God and say this is my
[31:01] possession this is something that
[31:03] belongs to me I don't have to drink of
[31:05] that broken cistern and say well oh I
[31:08] guess I have to have my pains and aches
[31:10] I don't I don't any and if any that's
[31:18] what like like what I'm telling you
[31:20] about Moses
[31:21] you see God was telling him Moses you
[31:25] have it in you I called you to this work
[31:29] speak speak and you learn you as people
[31:36] you as mrs. believers you that take
[31:38] whole this word you then listen to those
[31:40] tapes you can speak speak what you're
[31:44] asking God to do for you and he'll do it
[31:48] why because it's his promises exceeding
[31:51] and precious promises that have been
[31:53] given to this bride for this last day
[31:55] amen they know we don't have you know in
[32:00] the wilderness you start to look at in
[32:02] the wilderness you know when they were
[32:04] after they went to the Red Sea and God
[32:09] parted the Red Sea but you'll notice
[32:11] that in the wilderness they were going
[32:13] from dry lakebed to dry lakebed and they
[32:17] couldn't find no water and the driest
[32:21] place in the desert is one rock sitting
[32:23] out in the Sun you know and Moses comes
[32:28] and God tells him smite the rock he
[32:32] smites the rockin out of the driest
[32:34] place in the whole desert a hot rock
[32:38] poured out rivers of water the type of
[32:41] Christ
[32:42] you know the type of Christ the smitten
[32:46] rock poured out water so and if you look
[32:50] at the masterpiece Billy brown said
[32:52] that's smite in that masterpiece it says
[32:54] that's the smiting of the masterpiece
[32:57] produced the rivers the water of life so
[33:01] why what is it we're standing here for
[33:03] we're looking at the Word of God we're
[33:06] looking at what he's promised in his
[33:08] word and we're realizing hey I got a
[33:11] promise
[33:12] I got a commission God's called me to a
[33:14] higher calling God's called me to a
[33:16] deeper work God's called me to believe
[33:19] his word and by believing his word I can
[33:22] take possession of what God has given in
[33:26] this last days I'm living in a day when
[33:31] the Holy Spirit wants to pour through me
[33:34] more than once to pour through you wants
[33:38] to pour through me more than I want to
[33:40] receive it and pour it through me he
[33:43] wants to move himself through you and
[33:45] and and and and let that that that water
[33:48] move through you the Word of God in the
[33:51] faith that was once delivered to the
[33:53] Saints to pour through you to manifest
[33:56] itself hallelujah we still stand on a
[34:00] day and age when the Word of God has
[34:03] become so real that we we look at that
[34:08] that old story of brother Brown saying
[34:10] about the worst revival in the world
[34:13] revival they go to investigate what the
[34:15] world revival was and that policeman
[34:17] says it's in me it's in me
[34:21] the Holy Spirit's in you because he
[34:24] promised to be in you and that Holy
[34:26] Spirit is the fountain of life that Holy
[34:29] Spirit is a manifestation of God's Word
[34:32] in our day and age
[34:34] amen so we start to look at we're not
[34:37] going to rest on the on the on the we we
[34:42] look at that smitten rock and we realize
[34:45] this Jesus and we notice that in there
[34:48] is our healing its salvation it's our
[34:52] it's repentance it's a life-changing
[34:55] event
[34:56] you know like Peter one time let me read
[35:01] a little bit about that story I'm Peter
[35:03] st. Luke 23 32 and I was looking for
[35:13] that other place because there's another
[35:16] reference to this but I couldn't find it
[35:18] but Peter he was it was well remembered
[35:22] okay let me read this here it says would
[35:25] three I mean 3232 I mean where am I
[35:32] looking at st. Luke 32 30 23 I don't
[35:42] know I'm just lexing so I must have
[35:44] written it backwards obviously let me
[35:48] see it st. Luke
[36:05] mmm I did market here it's a same Duke
[36:12] almost 123
[36:21] where he was telling Peter that that you
[36:27] would he would deny him three times
[36:32] that's Simon Simon here it is 31 31 32
[36:40] of st. Luke 22 okay and the Lord said
[36:48] Simon Simon and he and Simon Simon
[36:55] behold Satan has desired to have you -
[37:00] to have you that you he may sift you as
[37:05] wheat but when but I have prayed for
[37:10] thee that thy faith faith fail not and
[37:15] when thou art converted strengthen thy
[37:18] brethren that's strange now let's take a
[37:23] look at Peter for one thing Peter had
[37:28] already told the Lord thou art the
[37:31] Christ the Son of the Living God that
[37:33] event had happened and Jesus said you're
[37:36] that you have the key okay and then here
[37:39] he comes down to the getting close to
[37:41] crucifixion and at the at the Last
[37:44] Supper and and Jesus tells him when
[37:47] you're repented you mean he had these
[37:50] great revelations and he wasn't even
[37:52] repented yet well then he when he went
[37:57] through the through the trial of denying
[37:59] Jesus those three times
[38:01] could you imagine Peter almost every
[38:05] morning when the crows how he felt
[38:08] remembering what he did to the Lord
[38:10] right you know it must have been really
[38:12] hard for him all through life from there
[38:14] on in but it also brought him to a place
[38:18] where even his shadow walking across a
[38:22] sick person a sick person would get up
[38:25] what made him so different
[38:28] what made him where was the virtue
[38:31] coming out of him from
[38:32] because within him was that holy spirit
[38:36] and that holy spirit so moving in him
[38:40] that he would he was he was so willing
[38:43] to to give his life for God after that
[38:47] that he would he asked them to prettify
[38:49] him upside down it's the history says
[38:52] that but then I remember and I just I
[38:55] was looking for this scripture but I
[38:56] didn't find it it said where Peter where
[39:00] Jesus had just raised from the dead and
[39:02] he goes go tell my brother and go tell
[39:04] the Brethren and Peter he reminded them
[39:08] to remind Peter well Peter wasn't Peter
[39:11] was probably really broken up at that
[39:13] moment but Jesus was mindful of him
[39:16] mindful of what he was going to and what
[39:20] if what a feeling when he found him once
[39:22] again raised from the dead we realize we
[39:27] realize that we too are have have come
[39:32] to the place where where we were where
[39:35] we recognize we've we've come to the
[39:37] place where we recognize that our life
[39:40] is nothing but our life in Christ is
[39:44] everything this bride is the Bride of
[39:47] Christ ministry but your call to us as
[39:50] believers in this Word of God that's
[39:52] coming our day and age to take him at
[39:54] his promises and to bring you back to
[39:57] the original word that was once
[39:59] delivered to the Saints is everything
[40:02] it's everything it's it's what the whole
[40:05] world is is waiting for amen brother was
[40:10] telling us about the about the
[40:12] resurrection and you start to realize
[40:14] they without us if you go to Hebrews you
[40:18] find out they without us can't be made
[40:20] perfect they need us they need us to be
[40:25] in that perfection that was once
[40:28] delivered to the Saints they need us in
[40:30] the book of Acts they need us having
[40:33] faith in believing God believe in his
[40:36] word taking him at his promise claiming
[40:38] it already said about us claiming what
[40:41] he said to us and speaking the word
[40:44] amen you start to realize that amen
[40:51] the woman at the well st. John 4:7 I
[40:56] don't think I gave that to them back
[40:59] there st. John 4:7
[41:11] for seven and Jesus I said for seven oh
[41:17] four thirteen and jesus answered and
[41:20] said unto her whosoever shall drink of
[41:24] this water shall thirst again but
[41:28] whosoever shall drink of the water that
[41:32] I shall give him shall never thirst but
[41:36] the water that I shall give him shall be
[41:40] in him a well of water springing up to
[41:44] eternal life to everlasting life we
[41:47] start to realize what is this it's the
[41:50] Holy Ghost that God's given to us in
[41:53] this day and age the Holy Ghost that has
[41:56] brought us to a reality of a Word of God
[41:59] that's been presented to us as a living
[42:03] sacrifice a living manifestation
[42:07] something that's been given to us it's
[42:10] God Almighty coming down to live in you
[42:12] and wanting you to speak his word
[42:17] wanting you to manifest the third Pole
[42:21] amen and how can we manifest the third
[42:24] pole it's by taking in its faith cometh
[42:28] by hearing and hearing of the Word of
[42:31] God as you take in the Word of God it
[42:33] brings you to a higher calling
[42:36] hallelujah we realized that Almighty
[42:39] God's bringing us to - to - to catch the
[42:42] vision you know one time there was a you
[42:49] know the Catholic Church people they
[42:51] they have they called visions of Mary
[42:55] they say and they said that one in one
[42:58] place in a desert place that Mary
[43:01] appeared and water started flowing out
[43:05] from a rock well they put a statue there
[43:08] and and that's very same place and it
[43:11] happens to be a city has grown around
[43:13] that area and and they and the water
[43:17] continues flowing out of the rock well
[43:20] there was a guy walking over there and
[43:22] this is the it was around it was over
[43:24] there in
[43:25] in where is it Vatican City or someplace
[43:29] over there in Rome there's a guy walking
[43:31] around looking and and and and people
[43:33] are getting bottles of water and halting
[43:36] at home and taking holy water from there
[43:38] and he started looking closer and he saw
[43:41] that there was a copper pipe sticking
[43:43] out of the ground they were getting city
[43:45] water and given a Terry buddy
[43:47] and it's not to myself that that sounds
[43:51] like our own house back home and in our
[43:54] place we have a place called the Sun
[43:56] twaddle and in this Sun tois Rio there's
[43:59] a there's a spot that they call it holy
[44:01] dirt well everybody gets this holy dirt
[44:04] and there's there's stories and and and
[44:07] and a bunch of what do they call those
[44:11] crutches hanging on the wall with their
[44:14] stories and all that laying around there
[44:16] and I went in there just look at the old
[44:18] sanctuary the old church it was and I
[44:20] look in there and I see all those things
[44:22] and I read a couple of and I says Wow
[44:24] I says people really have faith in this
[44:27] dirt and they keep taking the dirt and
[44:31] taking the dirt out of this hole in
[44:32] their little cups and I thought wow I
[44:35] says well that you know they I guess if
[44:38] they have faith in that dirt I guess
[44:40] they're it's okay
[44:41] but then I find out later on that a
[44:44] friend of mine was was was used to walk
[44:47] barefoot down there to the Sun patio and
[44:50] and and and and and worship there he was
[44:54] real Catholic and one day he was walking
[44:57] barefoot through the oils there and
[44:58] behind the church and he saw an old man
[45:00] picking up a couple of sacks of dirt and
[45:04] he says what do you do with that dirt he
[45:06] says all that people take so much dirt
[45:08] out of that hole I have to fill the hole
[45:09] back up
[45:13] and they all think it's a miracle that
[45:16] the dirt never runs out well you see
[45:22] what it is is this isn't a put-on
[45:25] there's nothin put-on about this message
[45:28] of this hour this truth that's been
[45:30] given us it's given to you you know our
[45:35] brother Branham was was called and they
[45:39] told him we a friend of yours has just
[45:42] gotten his his he got crushed his spleen
[45:45] is broken his livers busted he says he
[45:49] got crushed was almost two tons of
[45:50] weight and over his back or something
[45:52] like that and his liver and spleen are
[45:54] busted out and he's in the hospital he's
[45:56] asking you to come pray for him and
[45:59] brother Brown says well who might ago
[46:01] pray for him he says I haven't had a
[46:03] vision or anything he's talking to his
[46:05] wife and he says I haven't had a vision
[46:07] or anything how can I go just pray for
[46:09] the brother the the man he says you know
[46:12] if Jesus was here he says his hand he's
[46:15] got holy hands he would come down here
[46:17] and he'd he'd lay hands on him and the
[46:20] brother would just rise up he says but
[46:23] who am i he says I'm a sinner I'm I'm
[46:26] born in sin shaped in iniquity come to
[46:29] the world speaking life Who am I and how
[46:31] could I put my filthy hands on this man
[46:33] and and and raise him up I'm nobody I'm
[46:36] just as bad as he is as far as sin is
[46:38] concerned and all he says I'm nobody but
