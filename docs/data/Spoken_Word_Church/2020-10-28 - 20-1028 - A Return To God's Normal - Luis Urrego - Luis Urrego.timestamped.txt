[2:47] prayer
[2:48] they just they lost their one-year-old
[2:51] uh
[2:52] little boy last uh this this afternoon
[2:54] and this
[2:55] around 11 o'clock this morning and uh
[3:00] they've been having issues last time
[3:02] when we were there the sister was pr
[3:04] that was their second child the sister
[3:06] was pregnant with the
[3:07] with this child and uh i never got to
[3:10] meet the little baby
[3:12] but after a few months after the baby
[3:15] was born there were some complications i
[3:17] don't know exactly
[3:18] all the details but they were just back
[3:21] and forth back and forth in the hospital
[3:23] with the baby for
[3:24] for the last i'd say last five months of
[3:26] this year
[3:27] and and so finally the baby just passed
[3:31] away

[6:12] if you turn with me to isaiah chapter 43
[6:14] i'm going to do my best not to keep you
[6:16] long tonight
[6:17] i know that inclement weather is coming
[6:20] through and so we want to get you all
[6:21] home as
[6:22] soon as possible so uh we'll not
[6:25] will not take you take too much time
[6:27] tonight isaiah chapter 43 verse 18
[6:30] the bible says remember ye not the
[6:32] former things
[6:34] neither consider the things of old
[6:37] amen now isaiah was not talking here
[6:40] to not think about of course if we put
[6:43] the context in there
[6:44] he was talking to israel god obviously
[6:47] he was a prophet to israel
[6:49] but he was not telling israel don't
[6:50] think about the past
[6:52] obviously we have memories we have we
[6:54] have things that that
[6:56] experiences that we've had and and good
[6:59] memories and bad memories and
[7:01] and uh but what he's telling them is is
[7:04] it
[7:04] which is in the next verse he's telling
[7:07] don't get so consumed about the the
[7:09] things of old or the way of
[7:11] old because here god was about to
[7:14] introduce a new way amen
[7:16] in verse 19 it says behold i will do a
[7:19] new thing
[7:20] remember this is god speaking through
[7:21] isaiah now it shall spring forth
[7:24] shall ye know it i i will even make a
[7:28] way in the wilderness
[7:29] and rivers in the desert the beast of
[7:32] the field shall honor me the dragons and
[7:34] the owls because i give waters in the
[7:35] wilderness
[7:36] and rivers in the desert to give drink
[7:38] to my people my chosen
[7:40] the people have i formed my this people
[7:43] have i formed
[7:44] myself they shall show forth
[7:47] my praise amen you may be seated this
[7:49] this
[7:50] evening i'd like to just give this a
[7:52] little title a return to god's normal
[7:55] a return to god's you know we've been
[7:58] hearing a lot lately especially this
[8:00] year about a new normal
[8:02] that's a new phrase that we've been
[8:04] hearing
[8:05] a new normal and we have to remember
[8:08] that what
[8:08] god what's happening in the in the
[8:10] natural god it's also happening in the
[8:12] spiritual amen
[8:13] praise god so i i was just looking at
[8:16] reading this scripture
[8:17] and and and just thinking how god is
[8:20] telling here isaiah
[8:22] to tell the children of israel do not
[8:24] remember the former things amen
[8:26] it was great when we the former things
[8:28] and the way we used to walk and the way
[8:30] we used to
[8:30] do to to live and carry on our our way
[8:34] neither consider the things of old in
[8:36] other words don't get so fixated on the
[8:39] way things were you know sometimes i
[8:40] believe that
[8:41] that we we get we as uh as human beings
[8:44] we get so nostalgic sometimes
[8:47] i preached the message uh well i taught
[8:49] a sunday school lesson a while back
[8:51] called spiritual
[8:55] i did the things that happened in the in
[8:58] the 40s and the 50s and the 60s and the
[9:00] 70s and 80s
[9:02] and we forget what god is doing now we
[9:04] forget the present god that's
[9:06] walking amongst us and living amongst us
[9:09] and speaking amongst us and thinking
[9:11] through us amen
[9:12] because we're so fixated on the things
[9:14] of old amen
[9:16] and the things of old were great they
[9:18] were light for that time amen
[9:20] but god is still walking amen just like
[9:22] the children of israel when they were
[9:24] walking in the in the wilderness amen
[9:27] they could not
[9:28] stake their their post to the tent in
[9:30] the in the area where they were camping
[9:32] at
[9:33] for forever and think oh that's just how
[9:36] this is where i'm going to be it
[9:37] couldn't be that way because why that
[9:38] pillar of fire
[9:39] and that cloud was moving amen and they
[9:42] had to move along with it and if they
[9:45] didn't amen they would just be stayed
[9:46] back
[9:48] and the same thing goes with us saints
[9:49] if you don't move with what the
[9:51] what god is doing now amen you're just
[9:53] going to stay
[9:54] god's a gentleman he's not going to
[9:56] force you to do anything but you've got
[9:58] to move on with him in order
[10:00] amen to uh to receive from him amen
[10:04] praise god amen so he says here
[10:07] he says remember remember ye not the
[10:09] former things neither consider the
[10:11] things of old
[10:12] behold i will do a new thing now it
[10:15] shall spring forth shall ye know it in
[10:18] other words
[10:18] how this is going to happen and you will
[10:22] know about it
[10:23] amen this is something that you will
[10:26] know it's going to be
[10:27] visible it's going to be tangible you
[10:29] will know about it
[10:31] and it says and i will even make a way
[10:33] in the wilderness amen think about that
[10:36] amen that god can make a way in the
[10:39] wilderness
[10:41] god can make a way in the wilderness
[10:42] that you're in right now
[10:44] amen god can make you know those for for
[10:47] those of you
[10:47] who hunt there's probably not many
[10:49] trails in the in the woods amen
[10:53] and and sometimes you got to walk in the
[10:54] middle of trees in the middle of
[10:56] you have to use tools in order for you
[10:58] to get out amen
[11:00] if you didn't have these tools you
[11:01] probably end up getting lost
[11:03] but god is able to make a way in the
[11:06] middle of a wilderness in the middle of
[11:08] your wilderness in the middle of
[11:09] of what problem you may be having he's
[11:11] able to make a way for you in this hour
[11:14] amen
[11:15] it doesn't matter what it is that's
[11:16] right no matter if it's sickness if it's
[11:18] death if it's
[11:19] no matter what it is god is able to make
[11:21] a way and he continues to tell the
[11:23] children of israel
[11:24] and rivers in the desert now you don't
[11:27] find too many rivers in the desert amen
[11:30] but god is able to make rivers
[11:32] in the desert amen praise god so whether
[11:35] you can feed on so that you can drink
[11:38] and be satisfied amen
[11:40] it's like the the woman at the well amen
[11:43] when she came to the
[11:45] to the to the real living water she
[11:47] thought
[11:48] she was receiving uh the the water from
[11:51] the well and
[11:52] that was sustaining that was sustaining
[11:53] her physically
[11:55] but there was a man there that could
[11:57] sustain her spiritually amen that could
[11:59] give her the living water
[12:01] and that's what she was looking for
[12:03] that's what she needed and that's why
[12:04] jesus gave her amen
[12:06] praise god and she came running back and
[12:08] she told the the
[12:10] the the the city she didn't tell them
[12:12] about anything else she didn't go talk
[12:14] about
[12:14] her uh her dress or or her hair or
[12:17] anything like that she said come see a
[12:19] man who told me
[12:20] everything that i've done isn't this the
[12:22] very messiah and that's what's going to
[12:23] happen with you when you
[12:25] drink from the water of life amen you
[12:28] have no
[12:28] you don't want to talk about anything
[12:30] else you don't want to be engaged in
[12:32] anything else
[12:32] but amen to talk about jesus christ amen
[12:36] and his power and what he's done for you
[12:39] amen
[12:40] i will may even make a way in the
[12:42] wilderness and rivers in the desert
[12:43] the beasts in the of the field shall
[12:45] honor me
[12:47] the dragons and the owls because i give
[12:50] waters in the wilderness in other words
[12:52] those
[12:52] animals will be satisfied amen and
[12:55] rivers in the desert
[12:56] to give drink to my people watch my
[13:00] chosen amen are you his chosen tonight
[13:04] praise god to give my people my chosen
[13:07] this people have i
[13:08] formed for myself they shall
[13:11] show forth my praise amen you're not
[13:14] going to show forth your own thing
[13:16] you're not going to show forth
[13:17] anybody else's praise amen you're going
[13:19] to show forth his praise amen
[13:20] when you've really drunk from these from
[13:22] these rivers of life
[13:24] amen so we thank we thank god
[13:28] amen for for what god has done you know
[13:31] we thank god for what god will do amen
[13:34] but you know brother branham told us
[13:36] that there's a problem that we have as
[13:37] human beings
[13:39] even as christians is that we thank god
[13:42] for what he's done
[13:43] and we thank god what he will well he
[13:45] will do and we neglect what god is doing
[13:47] right
[13:48] now it's so easy to do that
[13:51] amen we think that right now with what's
[13:54] happening right now with what we're
[13:56] going through right now or whatever
[13:58] problem it is
[13:58] that god's not in our midst yet god is
[14:01] more
[14:02] in the midst than you realize that he is
[14:05] amen oh if we could just go
[14:08] back to when brother branham was here
[14:10] and the when the prayer lines and and
[14:12] those things
[14:13] those things were great for their day
[14:16] and as a matter of fact they were
[14:17] stepping stones for
[14:18] where we are at now we needed that in
[14:21] order to get to where we are now
[14:23] amen but we can't live in those days
[14:27] amen and neglect what god is doing right
[14:29] now because you're going to be like the
[14:30] children of israel being left behind
[14:33] you see they were walking in the journey
[14:35] they stepped through different phases
[14:37] instead
[14:37] where god was god was there in the phase
[14:41] of the 1940s and the 1950s and the 1960s
[14:44] in the in the wilderness amen but god
[14:46] moved on to the 1990s into the 2000s and
[14:49] to the 2010s and to the 2020.
[14:52] amen praise god and god is here amongst
[14:55] us i believe it because each and every
[14:57] one of you who have the holy ghost god
[14:58] is here
[15:00] amen i hope you believe that amen
[15:03] so brother branham says we thank god for
[15:04] what he did in the past and what god
[15:06] will do in the future and
[15:07] fail to thank god for the present amen
[15:10] we failed to do that
[15:12] and you have to realize that when god
[15:14] god is a present
[15:15] god he is a god of the future and he is
[15:18] the god of the past
[15:20] but he what did he tell moses when he
[15:22] appeared before him in the in the in the
[15:24] bush
[15:25] he said where moses asked them what why
[15:27] am i supposed to tell the children of
[15:29] israel when i go down there he said
[15:30] tell them that i am that i am
[15:34] american that i am that they serve
[15:36] that's the i am that i
[15:38] that i am amen he didn't say i will be
[15:41] or i was
[15:43] i am dead i am amen praise god an
[15:45] ever-present god amen
[15:48] in the time of trouble praise god amen
[15:51] amen
[15:53] but branham says in in um he says that
[15:56] all
[15:57] the natural things of the earth type the
[15:59] spiritual
[16:00] and then everything in the natural types
[16:03] types the spiritual amen everything amen
[16:07] so things that that that we're looking
[16:10] at i just want to mention a few things
[16:11] amen
[16:12] that uh just to lay a foundation to
[16:15] where i want to go
[16:16] amen but we see that the what
[16:19] we've been going through in the last
[16:20] several months and and it's been uh
[16:23] it's been weary it's been tiresome
[16:26] amen it's been it's been a lot of
[16:29] changes amen
[16:30] but god you have to remember that god is
[16:33] allowing it
[16:36] again always think about this god
[16:39] only cares about fulfilling his word
[16:43] and whatever needs to take place in
[16:45] order for the word to be fulfilled
[16:46] that's what
[16:47] that's what will happen he knows us
[16:50] better than we know
[16:51] ourselves we think that we're in the in
[16:53] in a position
[16:54] in a certain position and we're probably
[16:57] million miles away from that position
[16:59] that we think that we are
[17:02] therefore god puts us in positions in
[17:05] places and
[17:05] in certain situations to make us realize
[17:08] hey you're not where you think you are
[17:11] to make us think
[17:12] in our on our ways to make us think
[17:15] about
[17:17] what it is that i believe who it is that
[17:20] i'm really serving
[17:21] praise god what kind of example i'm
[17:25] being for my family
[17:27] my friends my the people around me you
[17:29] see
[17:30] god cares about those things and
[17:33] therefore he puts things in certain ways
[17:35] amen that
[17:36] makes you amen do according to his will
[17:39] amen praise god now the bible tells us
[17:42] in ephesians chapter 6 verse 12 he says
[17:44] for rewrestle not paul speaking for rest
[17:47] are not against flesh and blood
[17:49] but against principalities against
[17:50] powers against the rulers of the
[17:52] darkness of this world
[17:53] amen against spiritual wickedness in
[17:56] high places amen
[17:58] we have to remember amen that this is a
[18:01] spiritual battle
[18:02] right this is not a physical battle
[18:06] although we see so many things in this
[18:09] hour
[18:10] that make it seem like it's a physical
[18:11] battle everybody fighting amongst each
[18:14] other
[18:14] the race wars and all this kind of
[18:17] foolishness and nonsense
[18:18] politicizing everything and and we see
[18:21] it
[18:22] it's it's it's it's sinful it's gross
[18:25] and it's it's it's heartbreaking almost
[18:28] that's right
[18:29] but that's what's happened am i right to
[18:31] make us think see satan wants us to be
[18:33] fighting each other
[18:35] and failing and failing so that we can
[18:38] forget amen what's going on behind the
[18:40] scenes
[18:40] right so while we're fighting amongst
[18:42] each other amen we
[18:44] we we we're falling spiritually we're
[18:46] falling
[18:47] and we fail to forget amen the greater
[18:50] purpose
[18:51] and so that's what god wants us that's
[18:53] what satan would want us to do it's a
[18:56] spirits
[18:57] it's a spirit that is out there amen
[18:59] anointing people it's nothing but satan
[19:02] yeah that's right fighting each other
[19:04] all these riots all these things all
[19:05] these things going on
[19:07] that you see in the media there's
[19:08] nothing but the spirit of satan in this
[19:10] hour
[19:10] but we know that these things have to be
[19:13] these things have to be
[19:16] amen but you have to remember that
[19:18] you're not rest
[19:19] you're not wrestling with flesh and
[19:20] blood i'm not wrestling brother zach
[19:22] i'm not i'm not fighting brother don
[19:24] that no they're not my enemies amen
[19:26] as a matter of fact brother brown said
[19:27] that i am my own enemy that's right
[19:29] that's right satan's not even the
[19:31] greatest enemy
[19:34] satan just comes in and anoints your fl
[19:36] your your mind that anoints your your
[19:38] thinking and anoints your spirit amen
[19:40] and you have to wrestle with your own
[19:41] self
[19:42] every morning that you get up you have
[19:44] you have somebody there to wrestle with
[19:46] you as soon as you look in that mirror
[19:49] and it's you uh what decisions you will
[19:53] make
[19:54] what choices you will make that day what
[19:56] attitude you will have that day
[19:59] what things you will say that day
[20:01] because the
[20:02] your flesh and your spirit would want to
[20:05] go a certain way
[20:06] because it's the easiest way it's the
[20:09] easiest route
[20:10] somebody flips you off while you're
[20:12] driving hey man it's it's the easiest
[20:14] way to do it back
[20:16] it's the easiest way to to to to to to
[20:19] honk your horn and
[20:21] and then and do something back that's
[20:23] the easy route
[20:25] the hard route is not to go that way
[20:27] about that
[20:28] amen that's that's the that's the tough
[20:30] route now don't tell me that none of you
[20:32] all had had
[20:33] that problem have had that temptation
[20:37] somebody cuts you off or something like
[20:39] that
[20:40] you just stay nice and quiet
[20:49] i kind of doubt everybody has has acted
[20:51] that way
[20:52] [Laughter]
[20:55] amen but god's calling us i mean so so
[20:58] the
[20:58] the more often the more often you get
[21:00] cut off the mo
[21:02] for you to learn that lesson the more
[21:04] you're going to get cut off the more
[21:05] you're going to get flipped
[21:06] you know the more because god wants you
[21:08] to learn that lesson amen
[21:11] praise the lord jesus amen so thinking
[21:13] back on these changes amen
[21:15] remember returning to god's normal amen
[21:19] and we saw that there were very abrupt
[21:21] changes amen
[21:22] from the beginning of the year amen they
[21:24] were placed upon us pretty much
[21:25] overnight
[21:26] we were living january and february amen
[21:29] just normal like
[21:30] like nothing was had nothing was going
[21:32] on yeah we heard about a virus in china
[21:34] and
[21:34] you know kind of hearing the news and
[21:36] didn't think it was going to come here
[21:38] amen all of a sudden things changed amen
[21:41] and they they told us they told us that
[21:43] life amen was not going to be the same
[21:45] anymore and that everything is going to
[21:47] be different from now on the life that
[21:49] you
[21:49] knew before amen that's totally gone
[21:52] that's exactly what they're telling us
[21:54] now
[21:55] amen the world leaders and powers and
[21:57] powers that be they're all talking about
[21:59] a new normal as a matter of fact in the
[22:01] next few months you will probably
[22:02] continue to hear these phrases more out
[22:04] more and more
[22:05] a new normal a great reset and
[22:08] in the fourth industrial revolution now
[22:11] i don't say this you go to their
[22:13] websites and you can read about their in
[22:14] their own literature they talk about
[22:16] these things
[22:17] matter of fact they talked about these
[22:18] things even before the coronavirus hit
[22:21] this is what they want right oh yeah and
[22:23] if you if you know anything about
[22:25] the new world order this is exactly this
[22:27] is just another phrase for the new world
[22:29] order
[22:30] which the pope is in line with and and
[22:32] all the all these things all these
[22:34] people they're in line with with all of
[22:35] this
[22:37] and you're going to continue to hear
[22:38] amen so they want a radical change
[22:42] to take place what is the great reset
[22:44] what they're talking about is a complete
[22:46] change of the way
[22:48] human beings used to live they can't
[22:50] live the same way anymore
[22:53] and then they say they say they quote
[22:55] they say
[22:56] we've got to take advantage of the
[22:58] current pandemic in order to
[23:00] implement this change is there is there
[23:03] is there uh
[23:03] opportunity is what they say amen in the
[23:06] industrial revolution in a nutshell
[23:08] because we had for example
[23:10] the first industrial revolution made
[23:12] made uh was about
[23:13] using the steam and the coal a man to
[23:15] produce the engines and
[23:17] and things like that the second
[23:19] industrial revolution made use of
[23:21] electricity and petroleum and assembly
[23:23] lines
[23:24] that was around the turn of world war
[23:26] one all the way to
[23:28] around world war ii that was the second
[23:30] industrial revolution the third
[23:32] industrial revolution made use of
[23:33] digital electronics
[23:36] around the 70s till now right
[23:39] amen and then people also refer to it as
[23:41] the information
[23:42] age that's the age that we are living
[23:44] now that's the and they call that the
[23:46] third
[23:47] industrial revolution that's the age
[23:49] that most of us
[23:50] lived in that's right right amen it's
[23:53] the age i grew up in
[23:55] and it was it was nice it was it was
[23:58] nice
[23:58] the technology you know the smartphone
[24:01] came you know we didn't have to use the
[24:03] dumb phone anymore
[24:04] the smartphone came and not realizing
[24:08] that that smartphone you know it just
[24:09] tracks you wherever you go
[24:13] and then and it's it's just
[24:16] but because it takes pictures and
[24:18] everything like that you know it's all
[24:20] nice it's all pretty and
[24:21] on the back end they're doing things
[24:23] that you have no idea what's going on
[24:25] but now we're involved we're getting
[24:28] into what's called the fourth industrial
[24:29] revolution
[24:31] now you don't believe me you go and
[24:32] google these things it's there
[24:35] i'm not making none of this stuff up
[24:37] this is what they say the fourth
[24:38] industrial revolution is
[24:40] it says it's not only about smart and
[24:43] connected machines
[24:44] and systems it's a scope of the scope is
[24:47] much wider
[24:48] it's what they say it is the fusion of
[24:51] these technologies and their
[24:53] interaction across the physical digital
[24:56] and biological domains
[25:00] in other words what they want to do is
[25:02] they want you they want to mess you with
[25:04] machines some way or another i don't
[25:07] know how they're going to do it
[25:09] where you don't have to physically hold
[25:11] a tablet
[25:12] hold a keyboard use a mouse use a smart
[25:15] watch
[25:15] no you are the the machine right it's in
[25:18] you
[25:20] i hope we don't get to that oh you got
[25:22] that yeah i hope i hope i hope that
[25:24] i want to go home but this is the this
[25:27] is the this
[25:28] is what they want to take us this is the
[25:30] perversion that they want to take
[25:32] remember satan is the god of this age
[25:35] satan is the god of this of this evil
[25:38] world that we're living in
[25:39] and all satan does he hates the image of
[25:41] god
[25:42] he hates he and we and he knows that
[25:44] each and every one of us are created in
[25:46] the image of god and he hates it
[25:48] amen so he's trying to distort the image
[25:50] of god in this in this hour
[25:53] and i the things i've been i listen to
[25:55] the speeches of these people when they
[25:57] uh where they have the davos uh
[26:00] meetings and the world economic forums
[26:02] and all these things i listen to what
[26:04] they
[26:04] what they say and it it it it's almost
[26:07] creepy what they talk about
[26:09] but they talk about things regarding uh
[26:12] and it's almost it's almost like they're
[26:14] just blaspheming god
[26:16] they said our our our uh our data
[26:20] the data that they that they can they
[26:22] can grab from us that's the reason why
[26:24] you have smart watches that they monitor
[26:26] your health
[26:26] monitor your heartbeat and all that kind
[26:28] of stuff you think that's going that's
[26:29] going somewhere
[26:31] and they're going to use it and it's
[26:33] going to get it's just going to get it's
[26:35] going to get
[26:35] even worse but they say all this stuff
[26:38] is going to the clouds
[26:39] and it's going to be an a.i they're
[26:42] they're going to have an
[26:43] ai there to uh you know to manage things
[26:46] and then they say but it's not managed
[26:48] by a god above the clouds is what they
[26:50] say
[26:51] they say it's not has nothing to do with
[26:53] a god above the clouds
[26:56] but a but a god but the but the clouds
[26:58] that we have the microsoft cloud and the
[27:00] apple cloud and all these things
[27:02] and it's just such a blasphemy and then
[27:06] they talk about that these things this
[27:08] data that they're grabbing from you
[27:10] will be able to tell you if if for
[27:13] example the guy that was giving the
[27:14] speech he said
[27:15] he said i i didn't know that i was gay
[27:17] until i was 21 years old
[27:20] he said if i would have had this data if
[27:22] this data was being
[27:23] was being taken from me even at a young
[27:26] age
[27:27] it would have told me that i i was i was
[27:29] gay before i turned 21.
[27:33] see and that's what they want to they
[27:34] they they want to come to they want to
[27:36] they want to tell you the data wants to
[27:38] tell you the ai wants to tell you if
[27:40] you're a girl or a boy
[27:43] it's crazy it's crazy amen but that's
[27:46] what that's that's what the
[27:47] the that's what this world's coming to
[27:49] amen so this new normal amen that these
[27:51] that these elites in the world want it's
[27:53] it's anti-god it's satanic
[27:55] amen it's a dictatorship over you and i
[28:00] yeah
[28:00] amen but you know what saints god
[28:04] god has wanted the same people
[28:07] but not over a people and not a
[28:09] dictatorship over a people
[28:11] amen but he's been wanting to do the
[28:13] same thing but
[28:14] through a people amen he's been wanting
[28:17] to do the exact same thing
[28:19] but through a people amen ever since he
[28:21] created adam amen
[28:23] his idea was for for him to use man
[28:27] amen to rule this domain
[28:30] as a matter of fact adam had that domain
[28:32] had that
[28:33] had had that rule over the earth and he
[28:36] said
[28:37] he said adam you rule the earth and i'll
[28:39] take care of heaven
[28:40] that's right brother and of course we
[28:42] know that that sin came in the picture
[28:44] and it took all of that and that's the
[28:45] reason why animals now they
[28:47] they fear us and and when those things
[28:50] didn't even used to be
[28:51] you could go and pet a lion you could go
[28:54] pet a tiger
[28:55] and you could be with a deer and he
[28:57] wouldn't even run away
[29:00] but now all that's changed but you see
[29:03] the
[29:03] the reason why you desire to go
[29:06] for those things is because that is out
[29:08] there for you
[29:10] right yeah how many have not been a deer
[29:13] and
[29:14] and wanted to to be next to a deer you
[29:16] know to maybe pet it or something like
[29:18] that
[29:18] i know maybe some of you girls maybe
[29:20] might have felt that way
[29:22] i know my little girls i mean when they
[29:23] were younger i wish i could go pet the
[29:25] squirrel
[29:26] you know but the squirrel runs away you
[29:28] see
[29:30] so but that's not from the beginning
[29:32] amen
[29:34] god always wanted to rule amen and god
[29:36] has always been interested in
[29:38] sharing everything that he is with this
[29:41] group
[29:41] amen that's why he said in the word that
[29:44] we are
[29:45] heirs and joiners with christ
[29:48] if we are his children amen
[29:51] everything that he owns everything that
[29:53] he is we are amen
[29:55] when we receive the new birth in soul
[29:58] praise god and that is going to drive us
[30:01] a man to a body change amen
[30:04] the world wants a a technic a
[30:05] technocratic body change amen but god
[30:08] is going to have a body change for us
[30:10] amen and it's going to be a body that's
[30:12] not ever going to die
[30:14] an eternal body making this body that
[30:17] you live in amen this past house that
[30:19] you live in right now
[30:20] eternal amen right amen amen
[30:24] what great things amen that we're
[30:26] looking forward to amen
[30:29] see we are heirs and joint heirs amen
[30:32] when i got married with my wife amen i i
[30:36] didn't have much i had a little 98 honda
[30:38] civic red honda civic and
[30:40] and a little bit of money in the bank
[30:42] and then didn't have much
[30:46] but everything that i had became hers
[30:49] too
[30:50] that's right that's right you see
[30:53] everything that i
[30:54] owned the bank account the my honda
[30:57] civic
[30:59] even my clothes if she could wear them
[31:02] they were hers
[31:05] and that was hard for for for a guy
[31:07] who's used to being living single for 25
[31:09] years
[31:14] but it but but it became hers yeah right
[31:18] now she's still you know she still let
[31:19] me use them
[31:23] i'm just missing but everything that i
[31:27] had became
[31:27] hers why because we got married
[31:31] there's no such thing that you're you
[31:33] when you get married your bank account
[31:34] you have a bank account here your the
[31:36] wife and and the husband has a bank
[31:37] account here by him so that that's that
[31:39] shouldn't be that way
[31:41] that's not how that's not how god
[31:42] intended it to be and as a matter of
[31:44] fact you're going to realize you're
[31:45] going to have problems
[31:46] by having living your life like that you
[31:49] having separate banks accounts and then
[31:51] you're going to
[31:52] you're just going to bring problems you
[31:54] everything when you get married you join
[31:56] everything together because why it keeps
[31:59] you
[31:59] accountable to each other for one amen
[32:02] and
[32:03] and and it removes barriers of confusion
[32:06] amen you know where the money is going
[32:09] because it's one account
[32:11] amen but one has one account and one has
[32:14] another account or
[32:15] two or three accounts over here and
[32:17] you're wondering where's all the money
[32:19] going at
[32:20] why it's because it's not centralized
[32:23] amen
[32:24] i don't know how it got to that but
[32:25] maybe somebody needed it
[32:27] praise god so those that maybe that want
[32:30] to get married later you know
[32:32] think about those things amen think
[32:35] about those things
[32:37] so so everything that i had belongs to
[32:41] her
[32:42] amen because we got married see the
[32:44] marriage takes place here
[32:46] spiritually the marriage takes place
[32:49] here that's the reason why when you
[32:50] receive the holy ghost amen
[32:52] praise god that's a marriage amen that's
[32:56] a marriage and when we get to glory amen
[32:58] when we get
[32:59] that's that's just the wedding supper
[33:00] then that's just the celebration of the
[33:02] marriage
[33:03] praise god that took place down here
[33:06] that's the reason why when we're married
[33:08] down here amen
[33:08] is just that's why we become heirs and
[33:11] joiners with christ
[33:13] everything that he owns everything that
[33:15] he conquered everything that he is amen
[33:17] belongs to us
[33:19] praise god amen
[33:22] i love that amen praise god
[33:25] now we know that jesus christ he's the
[33:28] he's a he's a true leader
[33:30] amen amen and a true leader is one who
[33:32] is out there with the people
[33:34] right he's out there a true leader is
[33:37] out there working with the people
[33:39] getting his hands her hands dirty with
[33:41] the people
[33:42] not just telling people what to do go do
[33:44] this go do that good thing
[33:46] that no no he's out there doing it with
[33:48] them and even
[33:49] showing them how to do things that's a
[33:51] true leader
[33:53] and jesus christ this is that's that's
[33:54] what he did for us amen
[33:56] he experienced what it was to be sick to
[33:58] have a headache
[34:00] so that when you have it amen you re he
[34:02] knows what you're going through
[34:04] he knows what it is to be tempted when
[34:06] you're a young person why because he was
[34:08] a young person
[34:09] right amen he knows when he knows when
[34:12] you when there's a death in
[34:13] in the family why because he has
[34:15] experienced that as well
[34:17] he had family as well and they died
[34:21] as a matter of fact look what happened
[34:22] when when lazarus died
[34:25] he cried he cried as a human being
[34:29] but as god he said lazarus come forth
[34:32] amen and he had to come forth amen
[34:35] praise god
[34:36] amen so uh just remember in thinking
[34:40] about
[34:40] this this thought amen returning to
[34:43] god's normal amen
[34:46] now isaac newton said
[34:49] said something and and the brothers can
[34:51] bring it up i think i gave it to him
[34:54] as isaac newton being a scientist
[34:58] he said this he said everything
[35:00] continues in a state of rest
[35:02] unless it is compelled to change
[35:05] by forces impressed upon it
[35:09] let me read that again everything
[35:11] everything including
[35:13] us continue in a state of rest
[35:16] unless it is compelled to change by
[35:19] forces impressed upon it
[35:21] right amen that's how we were before
[35:24] that's all this stuff hit and we were
[35:26] just relaxed
[35:27] resting we go to church we go to work
[35:31] we come home we get and do this that we
[35:35] play with our children we do this
[35:36] nothing you know it's all just relaxing
[35:39] and restful and
[35:41] until something hits and it impresses
[35:44] upon you
[35:44] changes have to make have to make have
[35:46] to take place
[35:47] amen praise god something for example
[35:50] something uh
[35:52] something lands that's bigger over this
[35:55] pulpit
[35:56] if it comes down from the sky and
[35:58] crushes the pulpit amen
[36:00] it's going to make a change to the
[36:01] pulpit because that
[36:03] item that that it's it's bigger than the
[36:05] pulpit it's going to crush it it's going
[36:07] to make a change
[36:08] because forces have been impressed upon
[36:10] it you see and the same thing with you
[36:13] and i amen
[36:13] sometimes god saints has to impress a
[36:16] force
[36:17] upon us amen in order for us to change
[36:20] otherwise we're just pieces of daily
[36:22] daily and relaxing and thinking that
[36:24] everything is fine and dandy
[36:26] when in reality it is not in reality
[36:29] amen you're
[36:30] you're in a state of of mind that that
[36:33] oh
[36:34] it makes you want to uh because you're
[36:36] so relaxed you start devin into things
[36:38] that you really shouldn't be doing
[36:40] right brother amen have you ever
[36:43] noticed that when you're bored when
[36:45] you're bored
[36:47] when you're not really engaged in doing
[36:49] something that you should be doing or
[36:51] keeping your mind busy it's when satan
[36:53] comes in
[36:55] don't tell me you've never experienced
[36:56] that if you're not then you're not human
[37:00] if you're if you don't keep your mind
[37:02] occupied especially on
[37:04] on the things of god or doing something
[37:06] good amen that glory brings glory to god
[37:09] you better believe satan's going to come
[37:11] in there some way or another
[37:13] and totally distort that right amen
[37:19] because he knows your weaknesses he
[37:22] knows exactly
[37:23] what he can do and what buttons to press
[37:26] in order to get you to do something that
[37:28] later
[37:28] you feel condemned doing that's right
[37:33] you you feel condemned and then now
[37:36] it makes it worse now you don't want to
[37:38] read the bible
[37:39] now you don't want to pray not why
[37:41] because you feel so condemned
[37:43] and you feel like god won't hear you
[37:45] anymore amen i'm talking to somebody
[37:48] amen you feel condemned you feel
[37:51] you feel like you don't even want to go
[37:52] to church anymore i don't even want to
[37:54] see the people at church anymore
[37:56] and every time that preacher preaches up
[37:58] there amen i just get bored
[37:59] and i just sleep
[38:04] because why you've accumulated so many
[38:07] bad wrong things that you've been doing
[38:09] and now because you don't want to
[38:11] confess them you think that god won't
[38:13] hear you
[38:14] now you're living in a in a state
[38:17] of confusion in a state of backslid
[38:20] and the only one that can save you is
[38:21] god right right and the only way that
[38:23] you can he can save you is if you turn
[38:25] to him amen with
[38:26] all your heart amen amen
[38:30] praise god amen so so
[38:34] let not much rest be uh get get among
[38:37] you
[38:37] amen too much rest uh among you
[38:42] in your life amen eventually something's
[38:44] to come in as
[38:45] god's got to come in and take that rest
[38:47] too much rest
[38:49] too much relaxing too much thinking i
[38:51] got i got money in the bank
[38:53] i got two or three cars uh you know i'm
[38:55] paying high insurance on them but
[38:58] big monthly payments on but but it's all
[39:00] right i've got as long as i can make the
[39:01] monthly payment
[39:02] i know it's okay no once
[39:06] some way or another god's gonna make it
[39:08] to where
[39:09] you're not gonna rely on these things
[39:11] those things will be gone
[39:12] one day and all that's left is what
[39:14] you've done for others and what you've
[39:16] done for christ
[39:19] amen your bank account won't save you no
[39:22] right
[39:22] nope even president trump can't save you
[39:25] that's right
[39:26] everybody's just pull oh after november
[39:28] 3rd we can't wait well amen
[39:30] everything's going to get back to normal
[39:31] when president trump becomes president
[39:33] again and he gets elected
[39:35] i'll give you some news president trump
[39:38] is not going to make everything better
[39:41] he's actually one of the ones that
[39:43] visits these world economic forums
[39:46] he was there last year so whatever they
[39:49] talk about over there
[39:51] he's in on it
[39:54] so he's not gonna make everything better
[39:57] that's the reason why we got to
[39:58] amen look to the word amen jesus christ
[40:02] amen the president changes hey man your
[40:05] dad
[40:05] changes your mom changes your brother
[40:07] might change but god
[40:09] never changes hebrews 13 8 jesus christ
[40:12] the same yesterday today and forever
[40:15] and that is the only person that i can
[40:17] put my faith and confidence in
[40:19] that he will never fail me is this word
[40:23] this word never has and never will fail
[40:26] me
[40:26] no matter how much pressure comes in my
[40:28] life no matter how many changes come in
[40:30] my life no matter how many new normals
[40:32] they put in amen
[40:34] this word never fails amen the word
[40:37] never fails amen
[40:39] brother branham says this he says
[40:41] strange sometimes god does things
[40:43] off of the color that we think it ought
[40:45] to be in
[40:47] amen we thought that hillary clinton was
[40:49] going to be in the white house four
[40:50] years ago
[40:51] it didn't happen because why we put in
[40:55] our mind
[40:56] we we we fix things in our mind that
[40:58] it's got to be this way
[41:00] and and two plus two equals four and and
[41:03] this
[41:04] but yeah it's got to be that way and
[41:06] nothing can change you
[41:08] yeah until god totally does everything
[41:11] totally different from you
[41:12] and you have to re lower your head then
[41:16] and realize you were wrong but some of
[41:18] us don't admit it
[41:20] we just can't
[41:24] if you if we could just admit that we
[41:26] were wrong sometimes
[41:27] right that we fail and that we and that
[41:30] we did somebody wrong
[41:31] you know it would take us more a long
[41:34] long way
[41:35] our relationships amongst each other
[41:36] would be so much better
[41:40] amen strange sometimes god does things
[41:43] off of the color that we think it ought
[41:45] to be in
[41:46] this fellow you see was born talking
[41:48] about jesus
[41:49] this fellow was born to their opinion at
[41:51] an illegitimate birth
[41:53] his mother gave birth to him before her
[41:55] and her husband was married
[41:56] as brother don so greatly stated this
[41:58] morning it was a turning the corner
[42:01] amen a turn in the corner they didn't
[42:05] recognize it
[42:06] it usually happens that way it comes to
[42:08] that corner time
[42:09] amen that's what god is doing right now
[42:12] he's turning the corner
[42:14] he's moving amen and you've got to be
[42:16] following
[42:17] praise god and when a man overcomes in
[42:19] contact ever comes in contact with jesus
[42:21] christ he is different from
[42:23] he is a different he's different from
[42:25] man
[42:26] you're never the same when you want to
[42:27] see him if there's any spark of god
[42:30] about you amen again god's
[42:33] going back to god's normal god's normal
[42:35] has always been from the beginning
[42:38] it's never changed it's still the same
[42:44] amen and that's why he's trying to get
[42:46] us to come back
[42:48] to his standard and his standard is his
[42:50] word
[42:50] [Music]
[42:52] his normal is his word amen
[42:56] praise god
[42:59] praise god and god loves making changes
[43:03] yet he himself doesn't change
[43:07] he loves allowing you to get in
[43:10] situations where
[43:12] you don't know what to do and that's a
[43:14] good thing amen
[43:16] that's a good thing that's not a bad
[43:18] thing
[43:19] if you're a child a son and daughter of
[43:21] god
[43:22] god has a purpose for those things
[43:26] if you just hold on you will see the
[43:28] purpose amen
[43:31] amen i want to i want us to look at some
[43:32] examples amen let's look at job for
[43:34] example
[43:35] amen job was living his life he had
[43:38] uh according to the bible i think he was
[43:40] one of the wealthiest man in the world
[43:42] at the time
[43:43] you see had lots of things he had cars
[43:47] he had
[43:47] uh you know chariots
[43:52] he had nice things anything that amanda
[43:54] a wonderful family he had lots of
[43:56] children and and a wife
[43:59] amen what more could a man ask for and
[44:02] he also
[44:03] served god see he was a church-going man
[44:08] he he went to church he paid his tithes
[44:11] he he was good to the brethren he shook
[44:13] the pastor's
[44:14] hand and he listened to the word and
[44:16] took notes as he was listening
[44:19] he never fell asleep in church the bible
[44:22] says that even
[44:23] he even would offer sacrifices to god
[44:26] and would offer sacrifices
[44:28] for his children in case they had sinned
[44:31] and he didn't know anything about it
[44:33] right look how devout he was
[44:36] and one day satan comes to him and says
[44:40] have you considered have you consider
[44:42] what about job
[44:43] how come he he prospers so much because
[44:46] you are always backing him up
[44:50] and so because god had so much
[44:54] confidence in job
[44:55] he says okay touch him but do not take
[44:58] his life
[44:58] that's right you can take everything
[45:00] from him do everything that you want to
[45:02] but
[45:02] do not take his life and that's exactly
[45:05] what he did and in a moment's time
[45:07] saints
[45:07] in a moment's time when at one day joe
[45:10] had money in the bank
[45:12] he had his cars he had he had everything
[45:14] that he could want a good family and all
[45:16] those things
[45:17] in a moment's time all that was gone
[45:19] right his house was gone his
[45:21] everything was gone right except for his
[45:24] wife and then his wife even changed
[45:27] he started mouthing off of him telling
[45:29] him just curse god and die
[45:32] amen so
[45:35] there was a change but we know the end
[45:36] of the story the purpose
[45:38] see god was using god was trying to show
[45:40] satan something
[45:41] but was also trying to make job realize
[45:44] something about himself
[45:46] as well that he didn't know and would
[45:48] not know
[45:49] if that would not have happened in his
[45:51] life
[45:53] he came to a point where he said now i
[45:55] know my redeemer lives
[45:56] and in that day i'll see him amen in
[45:59] this body
[46:00] that's right amen praise god
[46:03] he would not come to that point if he
[46:05] had not went through that
[46:07] amen let's look at the children of
[46:10] israel for just a moment amen the
[46:11] children of israel
[46:13] amen when they were in goshen
[46:16] remember goshen after after they uh
[46:20] pharaoh told them that they could stay
[46:22] in the best part of
[46:23] of of egypt it was goshen
[46:28] they lived in the united states of
[46:29] america
[46:32] they were the land was was pl it was
[46:34] plenty it was it was good land
[46:36] they could grow anything i mean they had
[46:39] they had everything
[46:40] and for years they were prospering they
[46:43] were growing
[46:44] they had bank accounts they were making
[46:46] money
[46:47] buying new cars chariots
[46:51] they had gadgets everything and they
[46:54] went to church
[46:57] and it seemed like god was on by on
[46:59] their behind it was backing them up
[47:02] oh god amen i could i know god is
[47:05] is for me in it for us because look how
[47:07] our nation prospers
[47:09] look how we prosper look how look at the
[47:12] god is another business account that's
[47:15] come in oh
[47:16] thank god yes and no doubt god was
[47:19] allowing that for their lives
[47:21] but you have to remember that that
[47:24] back in early in genesis chapter 15
[47:27] i believe it was god had already given
[47:30] abraham a word
[47:32] and told him that your that your
[47:34] ancestors or the ones that were coming
[47:36] before you they were going to be
[47:37] enslaved for 400 years
[47:43] and that had to come to pass some way or
[47:45] another
[47:46] now the children of israel is they were
[47:47] living they didn't know anything about
[47:50] this
[47:50] that that word was given to abraham
[47:53] maybe they did maybe they did it but
[47:54] somehow
[47:55] it was it was it was out of sight out of
[47:57] mind
[47:59] and it had to come to pass all their
[48:02] comfort and all
[48:03] everything that they had and all the
[48:05] good things and everything
[48:07] all of a sudden came to knock came to a
[48:09] halt came to a screeching halt when
[48:11] when that pharaoh came in that new
[48:13] pharaoh that didn't know joseph
[48:15] came on the scene amen in this hour amen
[48:19] we might have a pharaoh that doesn't
[48:20] know joseph
[48:22] he sounds like he knows joseph but we
[48:25] don't know
[48:27] how do we know that's why we can't put
[48:29] trust in a man
[48:31] we can't put trust on anybody i'm
[48:33] telling you we cannot put trust on
[48:35] anybody outside of christ
[48:40] do not put trust in trump i'm telling
[48:43] you do not do it
[48:45] right because eventually trump will fail
[48:47] you and then what
[48:50] he wasn't able to stop a virus from
[48:52] coming in
[48:53] right so
[48:59] man can't do these things only god can
[49:02] praise god and so that word that was
[49:06] given to abraham needed to be fulfilled
[49:08] amen
[49:09] then what happens israel crying out for
[49:11] a deliverer
[49:12] for 400 plus years they were there
[49:15] crying for deliverer
[49:16] and it took those circumstances of them
[49:18] being whipped
[49:19] at them being enslaved amen for them to
[49:23] get down really sincere with god
[49:26] and say lord the promise that you made
[49:29] amen you've got to bring it to pass
[49:32] and we believe it and they got such
[49:35] desperation
[49:36] and god then came on the scene then
[49:38] right god then came on the scene when
[49:40] they got into desperation don't wait
[49:41] until you get into desperation
[49:43] or something terrible happens in your
[49:45] life for you to come to god
[49:47] don't wait for for your for for you to
[49:50] have a
[49:51] car accident or for one of your children
[49:54] something happened to your children
[49:55] for you to get closer to god
[49:59] amen don't wait amen for for
[50:02] for your bank account where you to lose
[50:04] your your money or go bankrupt or
[50:06] something like that
[50:07] for you to get closer to god amen
[50:10] get prayed up now for that time
[50:13] because we know bad times are coming so
[50:15] get prayed up now get prepared now
[50:18] get in the word now amen god is on the
[50:20] scene god is present amen he's ready to
[50:22] give you exactly what you need amen
[50:25] don't wait till then you think things
[50:28] are going to get better and you think
[50:29] that things are going back to normal
[50:30] they're not
[50:31] they already said that they're not
[50:35] amen amen it's time to get serious with
[50:38] god saints
[50:40] quit your foolishness put your plane
[50:43] around
[50:44] and get serious with god
[50:48] so the children of israel they were
[50:49] crying out and finally they were
[50:50] delivered
[50:51] but the deliverance didn't come to them
[50:53] the way they thought it should
[50:54] [Music]
[50:55] the deliverance came totally different
[50:58] from what they thought
[50:59] and so because it came that way then
[51:02] they started murmuring and complaining
[51:04] and then they started thinking in their
[51:06] journey
[51:08] to the wilderness to the promised land
[51:09] they were so excited at first
[51:11] and then in the middle of their journey
[51:14] they because everything got so hard
[51:16] and they they felt like there wasn't any
[51:18] food they started looking back
[51:20] at the flesh spots of egypt
[51:23] and had the garlics and the onions of
[51:25] egypt
[51:27] not realizing that there was those same
[51:29] flesh pots
[51:30] in those same pleasures amen also
[51:33] brought to them
[51:34] enslavement and torture
[51:39] but but because when when when you're in
[51:41] total
[51:42] when you forget that god is present and
[51:45] something's going on in your life and
[51:46] you forget
[51:47] that god is allowing this in your life
[51:49] amen you become blind
[51:51] and you start thinking you start
[51:53] thinking negative and you start thinking
[51:54] you start thinking that god is not
[51:56] unseen when god is on the scene
[51:58] you think god had forgotten them while
[52:00] they were in the journey when they
[52:01] didn't have quail
[52:02] god was right there the whole time god
[52:05] was right there in the form of a pillar
[52:07] of fire form of a cloud
[52:09] and they had a prophet with the word of
[52:10] the lord there
[52:12] but they had a hard time believing the
[52:16] prophet
[52:18] does that happen to us in this hour
[52:21] people that that have believed this
[52:23] message 30 40 years ago
[52:25] oh yes god sent a prophet praise god
[52:28] yes and they've shouted and jumped and
[52:30] screamed and they probably even spoke
[52:32] in tongues
[52:35] and then all of a sudden in the middle
[52:37] of their journey oh that prophet
[52:39] he says he's a prophet but i don't know
[52:41] now
[52:42] i don't know now i think i'd rather go
[52:45] back
[52:46] go back to what that's right that's what
[52:49] i want to ask these
[52:50] these people i pray for them i i you
[52:53] know i
[52:54] be i believe as long as they're still
[52:55] alive there's mercy for them
[52:57] that's just what i believe you can
[52:59] believe whatever you want to but i
[53:00] believe that there's mercy there
[53:02] for them but how in the world can you go
[53:06] back
[53:06] amen when you've experienced this
[53:08] wonderful word
[53:10] to go what to a baptist church
[53:13] how in the world can i go back to a
[53:15] baptist church when i came out of the
[53:16] baptist church
[53:18] and thought that that when i came out
[53:19] that was the greatest thing that had
[53:21] happened when
[53:21] this word came into my life to go back
[53:23] to the baptist church
[53:25] or to the pentecostal church no amen
[53:29] but that's what the children of israel
[53:30] were desiring to go back to the baptist
[53:32] church
[53:34] where they were enslaved amen
[53:37] because we don't believe the prophet
[53:38] anymore nah i don't even know how i got
[53:40] into that amen we also see an example
[53:43] with daniel amen daniel
[53:45] also they were living their life just
[53:48] fine comfortable and all of a sudden
[53:49] babylon came in
[53:50] took over amen took them to babylon and
[53:53] then they were enslaved and
[53:54] and but you see the story that that all
[53:57] that worked together for good amen
[53:59] praise god and so at this at this time
[54:02] look at the disciples amen when the
[54:03] disciples were
[54:04] were with jesus jesus was with them
[54:07] everything was just fine and dandy
[54:08] miracles were taking place uh uh
[54:12] great wonderful things were taking place
[54:14] amongst them and they thought that jesus
[54:16] would always be with them
[54:18] and then jesus would tell them listen
[54:21] the day will come
[54:22] i'm going to have to go away this is
[54:25] going to happen
[54:26] and they didn't even believe what they
[54:27] were what he was saying peter actually
[54:29] rebuked him one day and said
[54:30] not far be far from the lord
[54:34] be far from thee that can't happen
[54:37] denying the word
[54:39] and the word telling him what was going
[54:41] to happen
[54:42] so i wonder if we do that sometimes deny
[54:45] the word as the word is going forth
[54:47] amen you might not be doing it verbally
[54:49] but you might be doing it from your
[54:50] heart when you're there thinking about
[54:53] what i'm going to do at home as soon as
[54:54] i get home because i got something to do
[54:56] at home when you should be listening and
[54:57] paying attention to the word you're
[54:58] denying the word
[55:00] when you're thinking and you're
[55:01] wondering i wonder if such and such is
[55:03] listening to this
[55:05] uh uh uh oh this is for them yeah yeah
[55:08] get em get em get em get em preached
[55:10] yeah yeah
[55:11] yeah you're denying the word right
[55:14] right you're denying the word when you
[55:16] should be saying lord that's for me
[55:18] let me change so that that change can
[55:20] take place amongst others
[55:22] amen let me be the change you see right
[55:25] but we're there thinking about oh i hope
[55:27] i hope she's getting it yeah
[55:29] yeah preach on them skirts preach on oh
[55:32] yeah
[55:32] preach yeah all right buddy
[55:36] you're right a little bit down home
[55:38] right
[55:40] that's good sometimes but see jesus
[55:43] eventually went away
[55:44] and then everything changed it was a big
[55:48] change that took place
[55:50] for the disciples amen
[55:54] amen in hebrews it talks about god doing
[55:57] away with the old covenant and
[55:58] establishing a new one
[56:00] in hebrews chapter 8 the bible says but
[56:02] now hath he obtained a more excellent
[56:04] ministry
[56:05] by how much also he is the mediator of a
[56:07] better covenant
[56:08] which we was established upon better
[56:11] promises
[56:12] do you realize that the great things the
[56:14] the
[56:15] the the the superheroes of the old
[56:17] testament that we so
[56:18] say you know the david's the the the
[56:21] the the moses the the you know elijah
[56:24] and all these things
[56:25] they did every they did the things that
[56:27] they did and they did not even have the
[56:30] new birth
[56:32] they they did not have the new birth
[56:36] the way you and i can have it today in
[56:38] their soul
[56:40] they had a form of salvation they had
[56:43] they had an anointing
[56:44] you see but they did not have the
[56:47] baptism of the holy ghost
[56:49] because why could not come because jesus
[56:51] had to first
[56:52] die resurrect and come back amen in the
[56:55] form of the holy ghost
[56:57] that's why they could not have it that
[56:59] way but what about you and i am with the
[57:01] holy ghost in this hour what great
[57:03] things can you and me do
[57:06] amen amen what what kind of things
[57:09] if we are called amen for doing
[57:12] something like that
[57:13] that doesn't mean you know that you can
[57:14] just go do it randomly whenever no
[57:16] it's if god needs you to amen god will
[57:19] let you know
[57:21] amen amen if god told me tonight that i
[57:24] need to go to the hospital there in
[57:25] gainesville
[57:26] and go pray for somebody because they're
[57:28] dying of cancer
[57:29] amen and when that when i pray for them
[57:31] they're going to resurrect amen they're
[57:33] going to get better amen
[57:34] i better go do it amen and yes you can
[57:38] go and do it
[57:40] amen and something may happen or not
[57:41] happen
[57:43] but you you know but it's when god tells
[57:46] you to do it
[57:47] best you go do it praise god verse 8
[57:50] says for finding fault with them he said
[57:52] behold the days come say the lord when
[57:54] i will make a new covenant with the
[57:56] house of israel
[57:57] let's go down to verse 10 i'm trying to
[57:58] make this quick for this is the covenant
[58:00] that i will make with the house of
[58:01] israel after those days said the lord i
[58:03] will put my laws into their mind
[58:05] and write them in their hearts and i
[58:06] will be them to them a god and they
[58:09] shall be to me
[58:10] a people isn't that what happened to you
[58:12] and i right
[58:14] he's talking about the children of
[58:15] israel amen but that's exactly what has
[58:17] happened to us too
[58:19] amen and verse 13 it says a new covenant
[58:22] he have made the first old
[58:24] now that which decayeth and waxeth old
[58:26] is ready to vanish away
[58:29] ah i've always wondered why
[58:32] that was the word of god to vanish away
[58:38] did you see uh well all what it is is
[58:39] god's building on top of it
[58:42] not not vanishing his word can't go he
[58:44] can't go
[58:45] that's the foundation but it's building
[58:48] on top
[58:48] amen praise god amen amen
[58:53] and we see in second corinthians chapter
[58:54] five we're trying to move quickly that
[58:56] if any man be in christ he is a new
[58:58] creature
[58:59] all things hath passed away behold all
[59:02] things have become new amen you cannot
[59:04] be doing the
[59:05] same things that you were doing when you
[59:07] come to christ
[59:08] if you were if if you were drunk you
[59:11] can't be a drunk anymore when you really
[59:13] come to christ
[59:14] if you were a drug addict when you come
[59:16] to christ you can't be a drug
[59:17] addict anymore because all things that
[59:20] you were done that you were doing
[59:22] were old all old things have become new
[59:25] amen see god's about making things new
[59:29] amen bringing us back to that normal
[59:32] amen
[59:33] that has always been right amen
[59:35] ephesians 4
[59:36] 22 tells us that ye put off concerning
[59:38] the former conversation the old man
[59:41] which is corrupt according to the
[59:42] deceitful lust and be renewed in the
[59:44] spirit of your mind
[59:46] and that you put on the new man which
[59:48] after god is created in righteousness
[59:50] and true holiness amen praise god
[59:53] brother brown says here you know that's
[59:55] what's the matter with the church today
[59:57] it don't get in the spirit enough we're
[59:59] too much in ourselves
[1:00:02] my if you'll just get off of yourself
[1:00:04] long enough you say well you know our
[1:00:06] churches
[1:00:06] we have a regular routine oh who cares
[1:00:09] about your routine brother brandon says
[1:00:11] i wish you'd get out of the routine long
[1:00:13] enough to get saved
[1:00:14] anyhow amen get saved get out of the
[1:00:18] routine we don't care about the routine
[1:00:20] get in the spirit then you can see
[1:00:21] things done brother branham says
[1:00:24] amen when something gets out of cater oh
[1:00:28] well that's not what we do
[1:00:32] i wonder if sometimes if we hinder the
[1:00:34] spirit because we do that right
[1:00:37] because we're too much into the routine
[1:00:39] oh we don't do it like that around here
[1:00:43] and you may be quenching the spirit of
[1:00:45] god and you'll not even know it
[1:00:46] that's right so
[1:00:50] maybe god is using all of these changes
[1:00:52] saints amen for us to examine ourselves
[1:00:55] amen to examine our prayer life to
[1:00:58] examine our bible reading and studying
[1:01:01] amen if we're doing it enough to examine
[1:01:04] our sincerity
[1:01:06] are we sincere how are we sincere with
[1:01:08] each other or sincere
[1:01:10] sincere with with god amen
[1:01:13] to examiners to examine our motives
[1:01:17] what are what are our motives what's
[1:01:19] your motive for coming
[1:01:20] to church what's your motive for doing
[1:01:23] the things that you do on a daily life
[1:01:26] is it to glorify god
[1:01:30] or is it another reason god knows god
[1:01:34] knows your heart
[1:01:35] amen and to examine our relationships
[1:01:38] amen to for us to check our examine our
[1:01:41] relations check
[1:01:42] our relationships with each other i
[1:01:44] believe it's time for us to talk about
[1:01:47] things
[1:01:47] and to bring things out amen that still
[1:01:49] are bothering you
[1:01:50] if something something is going on amen
[1:01:52] in your life and you can't go away amen
[1:01:55] examine yourself right with that person
[1:01:57] make it right
[1:01:59] love the example that brother wade did
[1:02:00] the other day amen
[1:02:02] that thing that was bothering him and
[1:02:03] man he called the brother up
[1:02:06] amen i had a phone call with a brother
[1:02:09] just the other
[1:02:10] just last week about a certain thing
[1:02:14] and when we talked about it everything
[1:02:16] was cleared up
[1:02:20] it feels good to know the truth about
[1:02:22] things
[1:02:24] right right i think it's time for us to
[1:02:26] do that
[1:02:28] but sometimes we don't want to do it
[1:02:30] because we don't want to admit that
[1:02:31] we're wrong
[1:02:37] or you know if i'm wrong i want to admit
[1:02:39] that i'm wrong
[1:02:44] don't wait for for you for things to get
[1:02:46] worse for you to get things
[1:02:48] right with your brother or your sister
[1:02:51] for this first people to be dying
[1:02:54] amongst us
[1:02:54] and things like that or or something
[1:02:56] terrible to happen in your family for
[1:02:58] you to realize you know what i wonder if
[1:02:59] this is because
[1:03:00] this happened and this still has not
[1:03:03] been made right
[1:03:07] think about that
[1:03:14] amen
[1:03:18] just give me a few more minutes saints
[1:03:20] amen
[1:03:25] make you laugh for just a moment
[1:03:29] one time i was i was reading something
[1:03:31] and there was a man
[1:03:32] that was living in the backwoods of
[1:03:34] tennessee and think
[1:03:36] you know this is about regarding change
[1:03:38] change is not bad all the time
[1:03:41] change sometimes is good there was a man
[1:03:44] living in tennessee and
[1:03:45] back in the early 1900s he had never
[1:03:47] been to the city before he was a farmer
[1:03:49] he was a backwoods type of person
[1:03:51] and him and his family they lived there
[1:03:53] in tennessee and and one day he got the
[1:03:55] opportunity to visit the city
[1:03:57] amen and in the city he stood before
[1:04:00] in front of a building and this building
[1:04:02] there was a there was an elevator there
[1:04:04] of course he had never seen anything
[1:04:05] like this before and he sees this
[1:04:08] old lady you know this older lady just
[1:04:11] you know just walking in dirt with
[1:04:12] inside and pushes the button and gets
[1:04:16] inside the elevator door
[1:04:18] and he's just sitting there looking at
[1:04:20] her and like wow how this works
[1:04:22] and he just waits and he waits for a few
[1:04:24] minutes and
[1:04:25] and next thing a minute or two minute
[1:04:28] two or three minutes later
[1:04:29] this young woman comes out
[1:04:33] young woman comes out and you know she's
[1:04:36] nice looking and then
[1:04:37] and and my and all of a sudden he looks
[1:04:41] at his son he says billy
[1:04:42] come get your mother over here bring
[1:04:45] your mother over here
[1:04:48] he realized something amen maybe maybe
[1:04:51] that thing right there can change my
[1:04:52] wife
[1:04:55] he thought that was the same lady that
[1:04:57] walked in
[1:05:00] that was a good change amen
[1:05:03] that was a good change so changes
[1:05:05] changes aren't always good
[1:05:07] and this i want to finish up with this
[1:05:08] saints god right now amen
[1:05:10] everything remember in mount
[1:05:12] transfiguration amen when
[1:05:14] during the mount transfiguration god
[1:05:16] said uh uh
[1:05:18] there you know what happened and god
[1:05:20] said
[1:05:21] uh it's all it was all in him amen
[1:05:27] hear ye him amen it was all in jesus
[1:05:30] amen
[1:05:31] amen the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:05:32] dwelled in him amen
[1:05:34] praise god but now we got to get that
[1:05:36] same fullness amen that same
[1:05:38] that same jesus amen it's got to live in
[1:05:40] us amen in the form of the holy ghost
[1:05:42] amen
[1:05:43] and in this hour that's what's happening
[1:05:45] amen god is transitioning now amen
[1:05:48] it's not just god speaking through the
[1:05:50] prophet or god
[1:05:51] speaking amen but now god is using a man
[1:05:54] a bride to speak through in this hour
[1:05:56] amen
[1:05:57] praise god amen we know the we know
[1:06:00] these quotes amen we know what brother
[1:06:01] branham said about for example in this
[1:06:03] last day there is again another people
[1:06:05] in the land who under the under their
[1:06:08] messenger
[1:06:09] will be the final voice to the final age
[1:06:12] do you believe that i believe that with
[1:06:14] all my heart amen
[1:06:16] i believe that i'm seeing them right now
[1:06:19] you and i
[1:06:20] amen the final voice to the final age
[1:06:24] it's not just in the man not just why
[1:06:26] but but in in in the prophet amen the
[1:06:28] prophet's not here with us
[1:06:29] amen but the voices amen and that voice
[1:06:32] is
[1:06:33] christ's voice amen another one and the
[1:06:35] same and you can read these in the
[1:06:37] church age book
[1:06:38] yes sir the church is no longer the
[1:06:39] mouthpiece of god
[1:06:41] speaking of the nominal church it is in
[1:06:45] it is its own mouthpiece in other words
[1:06:47] it went and did his own thing
[1:06:49] so god is turning on her he will
[1:06:51] confound her through the prophet
[1:06:53] and the bride for the voice of god will
[1:06:56] be in her
[1:06:58] amen that's the that's the normal that's
[1:07:00] that's the normal that god's trying to
[1:07:02] get us back to
[1:07:03] the normal from the beginning amen when
[1:07:05] god created adam amen and adam had
[1:07:08] just to speak anything he wanted to yes
[1:07:10] sir
[1:07:12] god's trying to bring us back to that to
[1:07:14] that place amen
[1:07:16] oh and he says oh he has given a voice
[1:07:18] to the bride
[1:07:20] that voice is in the bride
[1:07:23] so if you deny that you're denying the
[1:07:26] message that you say you believe that's
[1:07:27] right
[1:07:29] you don't believe the church age book
[1:07:34] when you don't like when people sing
[1:07:35] about the voices in the bride and those
[1:07:37] types of things like that there's
[1:07:38] something wrong with your experience
[1:07:40] with god
[1:07:41] because that's what exactly what the
[1:07:43] prophet said and that's what the
[1:07:44] word says amen look what the word says
[1:07:47] in revelations chapter 22 it says and
[1:07:49] the spirit
[1:07:50] and the bride say come if
[1:07:53] if the voice if the bride didn't have a
[1:07:55] voice say man why is she saying come
[1:07:57] on amen the bride has a voice
[1:08:02] amen praise god and and
[1:08:06] in revelations chapter 21 look what look
[1:08:09] what god is gonna
[1:08:10] gonna do and god shall wipe away all
[1:08:12] tears from their eyes and there shall be
[1:08:13] no more death
[1:08:15] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[1:08:17] there be any more pain
[1:08:19] look for the former things are passed
[1:08:21] away
[1:08:22] amen and he that set up on the throne
[1:08:24] which is jesus christ
[1:08:26] said behold i make all things new
[1:08:30] the world wants a a great reset amen in
[1:08:33] the physical
[1:08:34] and they might get it but it won't last
[1:08:37] but this new that god is creating it's
[1:08:38] eternal amen
[1:08:40] it's forever and ever and we're part of
[1:08:43] it saints
[1:08:44] and he said unto me right for these
[1:08:46] words look are true and
[1:08:47] faithful that means they're not gonna
[1:08:50] fail
[1:08:52] amen they are not going to fail amen so
[1:08:55] saints it's time for you to make a
[1:08:56] decision
[1:08:58] right now it's the time of decision amen
[1:09:01] if you love him
[1:09:03] praise god then throw everything out
[1:09:06] throw everything that you have amen if
[1:09:09] you really believe his word amen
[1:09:11] throw let it go let everything else go
[1:09:13] amen
[1:09:14] and stay with the word if you say that
[1:09:16] you really love god and you really
[1:09:18] believe his word
[1:09:20] then let everything else go and get into
[1:09:23] god
[1:09:24] do the things that you need to do to get
[1:09:27] you to get you in step with god
[1:09:29] because if you don't feel that you're in
[1:09:31] step with god maybe you're not doing
[1:09:32] that thing that you know you need to do
[1:09:35] and when you're not doing that thing
[1:09:36] that you know you need to do in order
[1:09:37] for you to get closer to god
[1:09:40] that is iniquity
[1:09:44] that is iniquity
[1:09:47] and i pray amen if i have iniquity in my
[1:09:50] heart
[1:09:51] i want to make it right god show me
[1:09:55] amen i want to make it right i hope
[1:09:57] that's your desire tonight
[1:09:58] amen let's stand to our feet praise god
[1:10:01] returning to god's normal
[1:10:07] it's not a new normal god doesn't have
[1:10:08] new normal
[1:10:10] he doesn't change god's normal was
[1:10:13] established
[1:10:14] amen in in the book of genesis or before
[1:10:17] the foundation of the world
[1:10:18] amen amen god's normal was there
[1:10:27] and god knows what we are going through
[1:10:29] god knows what our futures will be
[1:10:32] and you just stay and stay
[1:10:36] concentrated in god you know sometimes
[1:10:38] when we get off of
[1:10:40] looking into the word the way we should
[1:10:41] and looking into other things and
[1:10:44] amen we get sight off of the main thing
[1:10:48] and we start getting fearful and we
[1:10:51] start getting
[1:10:52] we start getting uh uh
[1:10:55] we start disbelieving the word that god
[1:10:59] would not be able to take care of us
[1:11:01] when in reality god is more than able
[1:11:03] amen
[1:11:05] god has made a way remember that's why i
[1:11:07] read there in isaiah
[1:11:08] that he has made a way in the wilderness
[1:11:11] and has made rivers in the desert all
[1:11:14] right
[1:11:15] god can do that amen praise god brother
