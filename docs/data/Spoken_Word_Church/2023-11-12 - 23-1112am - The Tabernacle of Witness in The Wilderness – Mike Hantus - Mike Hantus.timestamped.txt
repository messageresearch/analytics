[7:01] God bless you may be
[7:15] sa amen thank you brother
[7:19] colie bless you you know that Matthew 6
[7:23] that chapter 6 is always my go-to
[7:26] chapter when I feel like um concerned
[7:29] about my situation you know whatever my
[7:32] need is you read that chapter and it
[7:35] gives you such a comfort to know we have
[7:36] a loving father that knows every detail
[7:38] about her life and I I'll share this
[7:41] just for a minute we only have one
[7:43] service so we can take our time this
[7:44] morning um that you know the scriptures
[7:47] I believe in the Psalms where it says he
[7:49] leadth Us by Green Pastures and in my
[7:53] mind I've read that since a child I've
[7:55] always thought about God just leading us
[7:57] on a big field of Green Field just
[7:59] luscious belly deep out fou for the
[8:02] Sheep you know but that's not the way it
[8:03] is I saw a video where the man he went
[8:06] to the location where David wrote that
[8:09] and showed you what he was looking at
[8:11] and it was a it was a mountain full of
[8:13] just rocks and desert and he explained
[8:17] over time and you saw the the little
[8:19] Shepherd girls leading the Sheep uh
[8:22] through the side of the mountain but
[8:24] under the rocks on that side of the
[8:26] mountain the Dew Falls every day and it
[8:29] creates these little Sprouts of grass
[8:32] and the shepherd leads these sheep to
[8:34] these little Sprouts of grass so they
[8:36] can eat just enough for that day so they
[8:40] have to rely on the shepherd the next
[8:42] day and the next day and the next
[8:45] day what a revelation that was and then
[8:48] you just think Lord if I don't have
[8:50] nothing no money no clothes I'm living
[8:53] every day in the Overflow I am living
[8:56] every day in his spirit and he's
[8:58] providing for me
[9:00] what a cfor you know that is such it it
[9:02] turned it it's like a was it a a
[9:06] paradigm shift brother Ernie he goes
[9:08] that paradigm shift that we have and I
[9:11] tell you it's just a faith builder then
[9:12] you realize your life isn't your own
[9:14] it's all about him and you're just
[9:16] living each day for him amen so I
[9:19] appreciate that brother colie you never
[9:21] know how God leads him to read scripture
[9:23] sometimes it might seem repetitious but
[9:26] if you just get in the word and hear the
[9:28] word speaking to you
[9:29] uh it opens up life to you brother
[9:32] Michael would you come this morning and
[9:34] take our ties and
[9:51] offering amen let's um let's sing that

[17:22] name this song
[17:26] um the song is uh we've been practicing
[17:30] this song and I think uh We've sung it
[17:32] here before but it really speaks volumes
[17:35] of of um kind of like that quote in the
[17:37] back of the uh Church there on Christ
[17:40] The Mystery of God and our whole motive
[17:43] of us becoming more like him is to give
[17:45] him the preeminence it's it's not about
[17:48] us it's about him and a lot of times we
[17:50] try to make it about us and and we fall
[17:53] and we crawl back to the cross and we
[17:55] realize it's all him and it's him in US
[17:59] but um you know there's times that we
[18:01] try to make it about our talent and what
[18:03] we can do and our actions and our doings
[18:06] it's what he's already done for us he's
[18:08] just claiming that by faith so if you
[18:10] know it you can sing the song with
[18:27] us

[40:00] just I'm just old brother
[40:05] Mike let me read you first questions and
[40:08] answers on
[40:10] Genesis speaking in tongues is a Divine
[40:13] gift of God which belongs to the church
[40:18] just the same
[40:19] today as it was back there in the
[40:24] beginning that's exactly the
[40:28] truth yes and d That's the Bible
[40:32] teaching it's a Divine gift and you deny
[40:37] that just the same as you deny the new
[40:40] birth you deny everything that Jesus
[40:45] taught when you try to cut that
[40:49] out now you can go wild on that many of
[40:54] them have but but I'm
[40:57] saying
[40:59] that has its place amen it's just like a
[41:04] pair of
[41:05] shoes when you buy a pair of shoes the
[41:12] tongues are in
[41:14] them and that's right and when you're
[41:18] into the body of
[41:20] Christ God has the whole
[41:24] table set full here
[41:27] amen why is not appropriate for our
[41:30] service
[41:32] today he's got a whole table set he has
[41:37] love he has Joy
[41:40] sir if I went to your table and sat
[41:45] down and you said preacher come and eat
[41:49] with
[41:50] me I believe you love
[41:53] me and you had beans and potatoes and
[41:59] carrots and and fried chicken and
[42:03] pumpkin
[42:04] pie and ice
[42:06] cream everything sitting
[42:10] there why I
[42:13] believe I'd be just as welcome to the
[42:17] potatoes that I was of the
[42:25] beans the only thing I believe I'd be
[42:29] just as welcome to the
[42:32] chicken as I was to the
[42:37] pie that's the dinner you've
[42:39] sit it's all on the
[42:42] table and the only thing I have to do is
[42:47] say would you please pass me the
[42:51] P I believe with a good free heart
[42:55] you're love to me you'd say certainly my
[43:00] brother have a nice big piece of it
[43:04] isn't that right if I would say pass me
[43:08] potatoes why certainly my brother here
[43:11] it
[43:13] is
[43:15] and every Redemptive blessing that Jesus
[43:20] Christ died for and purchased in his
[43:25] atonement Calvary it's sitting on the
[43:30] table and every believer sitting before
[43:34] it
[43:38] Hallelujah if I need healing I say
[43:43] father pass me some
[43:52] healing Genesis chapter 2
[43:56] and verse
[43:59] seven we're retrogade a little
[44:04] bit the title that I've got on the top
[44:07] of the message is the Tabernacle of
[44:11] witness in the
[44:15] wilderness there anyone here that
[44:17] doesn't believe that we are in
[44:25] wilderness
[44:26] Genesis
[44:28] 2:7 and the Lord God formed man of the
[44:32] Dust of the
[44:33] ground and breathed into him the breath
[44:37] of
[44:38] life and Man became a living
[44:48] Soul where did he get
[44:52] the where did he get the pieces to make
[44:55] the man
[45:01] from what medical
[45:04] book did he
[45:13] read it would be easier to Make a Man
[45:17] Out of the Dust of the
[45:20] earth than it would to give him a living
[45:24] soul
[45:27] dust to the Earth is
[45:29] natural you can form all kinds of
[45:33] things out of the Dust of the
[45:39] earth what does it take to give it
[45:52] life not life like a puppy dog running r
[45:56] at your
[45:59] feet not life like a herd of
[46:07] cattle here was a
[46:11] life that was a
[46:14] seed to grow into a life like the one
[46:19] that created
[46:24] it
[46:28] a message called This is a rising it is
[46:30] the rising of the
[46:34] sun notice this quickening
[46:37] power
[46:40] Zoe bringing the
[46:43] word the mind that was in
[46:46] Christ was in
[46:50] you
[46:54] then
[46:58] I'm trying to show you that
[47:03] you when you raised when God raised
[47:07] Jesus from the dead he raised up you
[47:13] also and also Quicken to life with him
[47:18] you are now quick to life although then
[47:23] you were but an attribute in his thought
[47:28] but God had
[47:31] saw all in
[47:37] him in the beginning God standing alone
[47:43] with his thoughts
[47:48] am you were one of those
[47:54] thoughts
[47:57] you are as Eternal as God
[48:06] is when God raised up Jesus from the
[48:09] dead he raised up you also
[48:13] and also Quicken to life with him you
[48:18] are now quickened to life although then
[48:22] you were but an attribute in his thought
[48:25] that's
[48:27] right but God had saw all in
[48:32] him at the Finish
[48:38] see so did you mean at the beginning no
[48:42] no at the Finish
[48:47] amen when God looked down upon the
[48:52] body the spirit left him in the garden
[48:55] of Gethsemane he had to die like a man
[48:59] the spirit left him in the excuse me
[49:04] remember friends he didn't have to do
[49:07] that am he was God God appointed that
[49:12] flesh which was human flesh and he
[49:16] did if he have went up there as
[49:22] God he'd have never died that kind of of
[49:26] death you can't kill
[49:30] God but he didn't have to do
[49:35] it but
[49:37] remember he went
[49:41] there with you in
[49:47] him you were more real to
[49:52] him at that time yes sir
[49:56] then you will ever be here on the face
[50:00] of the
[50:01] Earth because you were a part of his
[50:06] eternal
[50:11] faults there's a quite a few people
[50:16] here
[50:18] that I can remember as pretty young
[50:24] people
[50:30] looking at my daughter
[50:34] Ruth I first brought her
[50:37] here she's just a little
[50:42] fella it's not all that big now
[50:53] but but remember remember he went there
[50:57] with you in
[51:00] him you went to Calvary in
[51:07] him there's one place brother Brenham
[51:12] said you paid for your own sins in
[51:21] him God had never separated the bride
[51:24] from the group
[51:25] yet so when God looked down upon the
[51:29] body of Christ he saw both male and
[51:33] female it was all redeemed in that one
[51:37] body see they are the same same word the
[51:43] same word spoke of the groom speaks of
[51:47] the
[51:50] Bride well how can the Bride come and
[51:54] fail fa to
[51:56] manifest everything was promised of
[52:02] him and the groom
[52:05] come and he wouldn't be the
[52:10] bride but when he did everything even to
[52:14] proving it by raising himself from the
[52:18] dead
[52:19] afterwards then don't the bride have to
[52:23] do the same thing
[52:27] have to be exactly what the word said
[52:30] she would be in these last days don't
[52:33] she have to return through Malachi 4
[52:37] amen don't she have to be manifest like
[52:40] it was in the days of
[52:43] Sodom don't the word have to be just
[52:47] exactly like it is believe that amen
[52:51] these are questions
[52:53] right isn't these things a perfect
[52:59] identification of the word of
[53:02] God made known to
[53:10] us glory be to
[53:16] Jesus when we look at each
[53:20] other we are not looking at just another
[53:24] person
[53:29] those of us gathering together in the
[53:32] name of Jesus Christ when you look
[53:36] across the aisle or you you shake hands
[53:39] with your brother and sister you're
[53:42] shaking hands with an attribute of
[53:51] God with that just a word of
[53:54] introduction to those to whom I am not a
[53:57] familiar face Michael htis more commonly
[54:01] known as brother
[54:05] Mike in
[54:07] 1975 I met brother Moz and Brother Sam
[54:12] Dale how old was you brother
[54:20] Wade I pastored churches in mville and
[54:24] Jefferson in Georgia yes did an
[54:27] assistant to Stan price in Nar
[54:31] Florida well enough about
[54:34] me as the song says more about Jesus I
[54:40] would
[54:41] know more of his grace to others
[54:46] show
[54:50] am thank you Lord
[54:53] Jesus some of just saying thank you he's
[54:56] not going to continue
[55:02] singing Hebrews chapter
[55:05] 2 now when man become into that
[55:11] body he had control of all the fishes
[55:15] and fowls and beasts of the field where
[55:18] we at we're back in in Genesis 2 again
[55:21] aren't we
[55:24] amen
[55:26] and then there was no man to till the
[55:30] soil Genesis 2 he done made male and
[55:34] female but there was no man to till the
[55:38] soil then God made Man Out of the Dust
[55:41] to the Earth he give him a hand like a
[55:44] chimpanzee give him a foot like a bear
[55:48] give him he made him on the
[55:52] image and this Earthly body is in the
[55:57] image of animal
[55:59] life and it's made out of the same kind
[56:03] of
[56:05] material your body is made just like the
[56:08] same a kind of material as a horse or
[56:13] dog or anything like that it's made out
[56:17] of calcium podage petroleum Cosmic
[56:22] light you're just All
[56:27] Flesh that is not the same All Flesh
[56:32] like that is not the same
[56:35] flesh it's different flesh but it's made
[56:39] out of the Dust of the Earth where it
[56:42] come
[56:45] from and except we are alive at the time
[56:49] of the Rapture where it will go back
[56:53] to
[57:05] but the difference between an animal and
[57:07] a man God put a soul in a
[57:11] man he did not put it in the animal
[57:15] because the soul that was in the
[57:20] man is that
[57:23] theophany
[57:32] just a little piece from a message
[57:34] called the Inon as God of old when we
[57:39] hear thy ashes to ashes and dust to dust
[57:43] it reminds me of long fow who said tell
[57:47] me not in mournful numbers life is just
[57:51] an empty dream the soul is dead that
[57:55] Slumbers and things are not as they
[57:59] seem he said yay life is real and life
[58:03] is earnest and the grave is not its goal
[58:06] for dust thou us to dust Thou Art to
[58:11] dust
[58:22] returnthe opony
[58:25] amen and when we leave
[58:28] here we go in somewhere
[58:32] else whatever it may
[58:36] be I take the apostles
[58:39] word when he said if this Earthly
[58:42] Tabernacle or Dwelling Place be
[58:45] dissolved we have one already waiting to
[58:48] move from
[58:50] this to
[58:53] that
[59:02] see our
[59:06] soul brother brandom said the soul
[59:08] that's in a man is worth 10,000
[59:16] worlds and it's in you but it's
[59:23] not you're you're going to it but it's
[59:27] always been with you
[59:32] amen you say that must be Supernatural
[59:35] brother
[59:39] Mike who is this m
[59:41] jedc and
[59:44] he would hear that H
[59:47] cluck he would try his best to
[59:50] cluck he couldn't do
[59:53] it he he tried to cheap like a
[59:57] chicken but he couldn't do it see he was
[1:00:01] an
[1:00:03] eagle to start with he was an
[1:00:07] eagle he was just hatched under a
[1:00:13] hand like some church
[1:00:19] members that's about the way it is one
[1:00:22] out of a setting right
[1:00:25] one day Mommy flew over and she
[1:00:31] screamed he recognized
[1:00:36] it he had never seen an
[1:00:43] eagle he recognized
[1:00:46] it it sounded right amen why he was an
[1:00:52] eagle to begin with
[1:00:56] and this is the story brother brandham
[1:00:58] told about the man that climbed up and
[1:01:01] found this Eagle's Nest and there was
[1:01:03] two eggs in it and he took one of those
[1:01:07] eggs carried it back to his farm and put
[1:01:11] it under a
[1:01:14] chicken well the chicken
[1:01:17] had about 12 more eggs in the
[1:01:23] nest but when she sat on that one
[1:01:31] golly it was almost as big as the other
[1:01:38] 12 but Faithfully she sat on the egg
[1:01:43] until all of them hatched and then she
[1:01:47] lined up all those little chickens and
[1:01:49] took them out in the
[1:01:52] barnyard found them a nice bug
[1:01:57] grass seed weed
[1:02:01] seed and they rejoiced and
[1:02:05] clucked and they
[1:02:07] cheaped except for that big old
[1:02:12] thing my
[1:02:17] goodness that that little chick he could
[1:02:20] eat two or three seeds and he satisfied
[1:02:23] for a few minutes
[1:02:29] that big old thing he was looking around
[1:02:31] for something
[1:02:36] red it just wasn't there that's
[1:02:42] right one day his mamy flew over and
[1:02:45] screamed he recognized it that sounded
[1:02:48] right why he was an eagle to begin with
[1:02:52] that's the way it is with the gospel El
[1:02:55] or the word or the power of Jesus Christ
[1:02:58] when a man has been
[1:03:01] predestinated to eternal life he hears
[1:03:04] that true ring that scream of God am
[1:03:09] nothing can keep him from
[1:03:22] it I was a minister with the Assemblies
[1:03:25] of God when I first heard that scream
[1:03:35] amen I didn't know what to
[1:03:40] think other
[1:03:44] Mike what are you
[1:03:49] doing don't don't you
[1:03:53] know you you have been groomed and
[1:03:59] raised under a
[1:04:02] minister that
[1:04:04] prophesied he was going to
[1:04:07] be the
[1:04:13] next state of New
[1:04:16] York
[1:04:18] preser he was going to be the big
[1:04:23] guy
[1:04:28] and
[1:04:30] and and then you
[1:04:36] moved and we accepted you with open arms
[1:04:40] because you had such a
[1:04:42] recommendation from the New York
[1:04:50] district and
[1:04:53] now you're going after this
[1:05:00] Renegade what do you think you're
[1:05:04] doing I think I'm following
[1:05:11] God there was a scream I heard
[1:05:16] amen it sounded real
[1:05:20] yeah it stirred something in me
[1:05:28] that
[1:05:31] it the Constitution and bylaws of the
[1:05:34] Assembly of God never stirred me like
[1:05:37] that scream
[1:05:44] did it was something different yes it
[1:05:47] went way down inside of
[1:05:50] me not in
[1:05:53] here in was it in here
[1:05:58] yeah don't really know where it
[1:06:02] was just like I talk about my
[1:06:05] soul I don't know really exactly where
[1:06:10] it
[1:06:12] is I know it's
[1:06:17] real I know since that day I've had
[1:06:20] fellowship with him
[1:06:23] yeah
[1:06:26] amen I was predestinated to
[1:06:32] it that barnyard stuff wouldn't do for
[1:06:35] him anymore he's gone all things are
[1:06:39] possible he gets off the ground that's
[1:06:42] what's the matter with so many
[1:06:44] Christians today they can't get their
[1:06:47] feet off of the ground oh Mommy said Son
[1:06:52] jump you're an eagle come up here where
[1:06:55] I am he said Mom I never jumped in my
[1:07:03] life he said well you jump you're an
[1:07:05] eagle to begin with you're not a chicken
[1:07:09] so he made his first jump and he flopped
[1:07:12] his wings and didn't do too good but he
[1:07:15] got off the
[1:07:17] ground that's the way we do we accept
[1:07:20] God by Faith by the written word there's
[1:07:24] something in there that's eternal life
[1:07:28] you were
[1:07:30] predestinated to it
[1:07:33] sir his grandpa his grandma were Eagles
[1:07:37] he was an eagle all the way back Eagles
[1:07:41] don't mix with other things he's not a
[1:07:44] hybrid he's an eagle then after you
[1:07:51] recognized the very word of God was
[1:07:54] eagal
[1:07:55] food then you left the other thing you
[1:07:59] have been formed into the living image
[1:08:04] of the Living God you heard from your
[1:08:12] theophany if this Earthly ble be
[1:08:15] dissolved we have one
[1:08:18] waiting you say is that right brother
[1:08:22] Brenham
[1:08:25] in my humble
[1:08:28] opinion everything that brother brandom
[1:08:30] said Is
[1:08:34] Right how can I overcome he said some
[1:08:38] strange things
[1:08:44] though when you see them acting
[1:08:46] themselves out in your body and your
[1:08:52] mind
[1:08:54] your soul your theophany Rises up and
[1:08:59] shouts for
[1:09:03] Joy how can I overcome and there's
[1:09:06] always been an arc in God's
[1:09:09] economy there was an ark in the days of
[1:09:12] Noah for the saving of the people there
[1:09:15] was an ark in the days of the law the
[1:09:18] Ark of testimony in the days of the law
[1:09:21] following they followed the ark and
[1:09:25] there is a third dispensation now like
[1:09:30] Noah's
[1:09:33] time Lots time and now this time and
[1:09:39] there's an ark now and that Arc is not a
[1:09:43] denomination neither is it good works
[1:09:45] that you can
[1:09:47] do it's by one Spirit Romans 81 we are
[1:09:53] all all baptized into one
[1:09:57] body in the domain of that Kingdom one
[1:10:02] spiritual baptism no matter how good how
[1:10:06] bad whatever you're in that Kingdom by
[1:10:11] the Holy Ghost
[1:10:13] baptism see that's the only way you can
[1:10:18] overcome It's all under the shed blood
[1:10:22] his Overcomers because you cannot
[1:10:25] overcome yourself it's he that overcome
[1:10:30] for
[1:10:31] you you are
[1:10:40] resting Ephesians 28 and N for by grace
[1:10:46] are ye saved through
[1:10:49] faith and that not of
[1:10:52] yourselves it is the gift of God not of
[1:10:56] Works lest any man should
[1:11:01] boast Psalms
[1:11:04] 141:8 but mine eyes are unto thee Oh God
[1:11:09] am the Lord in thee is my trust leave
[1:11:14] not my soul
[1:11:21] destitute if like the high
[1:11:24] priest my soul has
[1:11:27] entered the holy of
[1:11:29] holies it must be in motion
[1:11:34] continually the high priest that went
[1:11:37] behind the veil he had on the bottom of
[1:11:40] His Garment bells and
[1:11:44] pomegranates and as he
[1:11:47] walked the bells and pomeranets rang
[1:11:52] together and that behind the veil there
[1:11:56] was a continual ringing cuz he was
[1:11:59] continually moving amen aren't you
[1:12:02] continually moving on Amen can you stand
[1:12:07] still in the gospel and
[1:12:13] prosper like the high priest my soul has
[1:12:16] entered the holy of holies it must be in
[1:12:19] motion continually holy holy holy holy
[1:12:24] unto the

[1:12:33] said I'm coming
[1:12:37] down to the people holy holy

[1:12:59] right remember your soul with the Holy
[1:13:02] Ghost life
[1:13:04] himself is not a type or a
[1:13:09] shadow of
[1:13:13] anything but you as the
[1:13:16] product the
[1:13:19] antitype you are what the whole Bible
[1:13:23] has has spoke of in all of its types and
[1:13:30] shadows John 1:1 in the beginning was
[1:13:34] the
[1:13:35] word and the original that word is
[1:13:41] logos in the beginning was the word and
[1:13:44] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:13:47] God yes and the same was in the
[1:13:50] beginning with God all things were were
[1:13:53] made by him and without him was not
[1:13:57] anything made that was
[1:14:00] made that includes me amen and that
[1:14:05] includes
[1:14:11] youen in him was
[1:14:13] life and the life was the light of
[1:14:18] man and the light shineth in
[1:14:21] darkness and the Darkness comprehended
[1:14:25] it
[1:14:30] not and the Webster's
[1:14:33] Dictionary comprehended means to
[1:14:40] understand in
[1:14:42] the
[1:14:44] Hebrew or the Greek that this came
[1:14:47] from the word comprehended
[1:14:52] means it had no
[1:14:55] power over that to stop it to start it
[1:15:00] am or anything
[1:15:03] else you were in complete
[1:15:09] control of that
[1:15:13] light because you are the
[1:15:20] light just as someone came up
[1:15:23] along and spoke to you they were light
[1:15:28] to
[1:15:29] you you are the light that shines in the
[1:15:33] darkness to
[1:15:37] others those that were there with him at
[1:15:41] the foundation of the
[1:15:45] world not in
[1:15:50] flesh not in thought it was greater than
[1:15:54] a thought it was more positive than a
[1:15:58] thought yes
[1:16:02] sir almost like you were a part of him
[1:16:08] yes until you could become a part of
[1:16:14] him Colossians 4 verse
[1:16:19] two continue in prayer and watch the
[1:16:23] same with

[1:16:28] us that God would open us would open
[1:16:32] unto us a door of
[1:16:36] utterance
[1:16:39] logos the
[1:16:41] same word utterance in Colossians 4:2 is
[1:16:47] the same
[1:16:48] word word in John
[1:16:52] 1:1
[1:16:57] it was not a written word on a
[1:17:01] page it was not a form that you saw in a
[1:17:06] cloud well that looks like a word
[1:17:09] no
[1:17:11] no this didn't just look like a
[1:17:19] word any appearance of it to an
[1:17:22] individual
[1:17:23] idual they know for a
[1:17:27] fact it was a
[1:17:35] Loos that God would open unto us a door
[1:17:39] of utterance to speak the mystery of
[1:17:43] Christ for which I am also in bonds that
[1:17:47] I may make it manifest as I ought to

[1:18:58] this

[1:19:04] it to the little peep that came out of
[1:19:07] the egg
[1:19:10] no it's the little peep that's still in
[1:19:13] the egg that's waiting to be hatched out

[1:23:27] destroy they destroyed the
[1:23:30] flesh they couldn't touch the
[1:23:40] soul if they had a spear as long as this
[1:23:48] Sanctuary they still couldn't Pierce
[1:23:51] their soul with it that's right
[1:23:56] amen what would you have to have to
[1:24:00] pierce their

[1:27:48] unclothed but clothed upon yes that
[1:27:52] mortality might be swallowed up of
[1:27:59] Life
[1:28:02] reality the reality of what how God has
[1:28:06] sold

[1:30:28] sight we are confident I say and willing
[1:30:33] rather to be absent from the body and to
[1:30:36] be present with the Lord wherefore we

[1:36:18] temporal but the things which are not

[1:37:30] healed I think
[1:37:33] that I Surrender my thinking I won't no

[1:37:40] more think about the disease I had I
[1:37:44] ain't thinking about nothing but
[1:37:47] what but thinking what you said
[1:37:55] now right out in front of you stands a
[1:37:59] person just like you was a few minutes
[1:38:03] ago you were sick down
[1:38:06] here but there's a well
[1:38:09] person standing
[1:38:12] there Jesus Christ is calling you to
[1:38:16] that well person right Beyond
[1:38:20] it
[1:38:21] now you just by faith as you close your
[1:38:27] eyes walk right into that well
[1:38:31] body amen see then you just keep on
[1:38:35] walking am just keep on
[1:38:37] going I surrender all the Lord bless
[1:38:42] you we're almost
[1:38:49] done like in in this world everything
[1:38:52] comes to an
[1:38:55] end I've only got one more page to
[1:39:05] turn at the end of this will be the
[1:39:07] beginning of something
[1:39:14] else end time
[1:39:16] evangelism oh I think they're so cute
[1:39:20] little fellas
[1:39:22] I like all people but children but I
[1:39:25] think children and then old people when
[1:39:29] you get old some old man or woman come
[1:39:32] down along the way so feeble and I think
[1:39:35] they're just pitiful like you know and I
[1:39:39] just think we should never you see them
[1:39:42] crossing the street
[1:39:44] stop what if that was your daddy or your
[1:39:47] mother see somebody so respect them and
[1:39:53] they talk maybe
[1:39:55] slow and a long time maybe even like
[1:39:59] brother
[1:40:01] Mike see them crossing the street stop
[1:40:06] what if that was your daddy or mother
[1:40:09] somebody so respect them and they talk
[1:40:14] maybe slow and a long time maybe maybe
[1:40:17] sometime they repeats too and maybe
[1:40:21] things that you don't want to
[1:40:24] hear but
[1:40:26] remember you may get
[1:40:30] old you may get old too someday so just
[1:40:35] always respect them and them little
[1:40:40] fellas who could mistreat one of
[1:40:44] those by the way you should never do
[1:40:48] that you know Jesus said to take heed
[1:40:52] that you despise not one of these little
[1:40:55] ones for their
[1:40:57] Angels always behold my father's face
[1:41:01] which is in heaven yes right remember
[1:41:05] they have an
[1:41:07] angel when you're born it stays with you
[1:41:12] all through
[1:41:15] life and now and then when you get
[1:41:19] saved and now
[1:41:21] then when you get saved you have the
[1:41:24] Holy Spirit then and it guides you and
[1:41:28] directs
[1:41:31] you questions and
[1:41:35] answers now he would if you notice
[1:41:39] Matthew
[1:41:41] 18:10 he was speaking about little
[1:41:47] children they was little children Little
[1:41:49] Tots three four years years old picked
[1:41:51] them up they brought them unto him
[1:41:54] children child children comes from the
[1:41:57] word name of child a child is just a
[1:42:00] little fell not an infant but between
[1:42:04] that and teenagers see he's not
[1:42:07] responsible yet for
[1:42:10] himself now he said take heed that you
[1:42:14] don't
[1:42:15] despise if you really take that
[1:42:18] interpretation of that word is mistreat
[1:42:22] see to mistreat one of those mistreat a
[1:42:27] child you should never do that they're
[1:42:31] children they don't know
[1:42:34] see and now notice because their
[1:42:39] Angels always beholds my father's face
[1:42:44] which is in
[1:42:47] heaven you see in other words that their
[1:42:51] Angels their Messengers their bodies the
[1:42:56] Angelic bodies that they'll go to if
[1:42:59] they
[1:43:00] die are always before my father's face
[1:43:05] in
[1:43:08] heaven it's not written on the page
[1:43:11] right there but it's written on all
[1:43:13] these Pages it's their
[1:43:18] theophany it's their soul
[1:43:28] always before my father's face in
[1:43:35] heaven Hebrews chapter 2 now when man
[1:43:40] becomes that body he had control of all
[1:43:43] the fishes he's back in
[1:43:47] Genesis all the foul and beast of the
[1:43:50] field
[1:43:51] and then there was no man to till the
[1:43:54] soil he done made man male and female no
[1:43:58] man to till the soil then God made Man
[1:44:01] Out of the Dust of the earth give him a
[1:44:03] hand like a
[1:44:05] chimpanzee give him a foot like a
[1:44:09] bear he made him on the
[1:44:13] image and this Earthly
[1:44:16] body is in the image of animal life
[1:44:22] it's made out of the same kind of
[1:44:25] material your body is the same kind of
[1:44:29] material as a horse or a dog anything
[1:44:32] like that it's made out of calcium poage
[1:44:36] petroleum Cosmic light All Flesh like
[1:44:40] that is not the same flesh it's
[1:44:42] different flesh but it's made out of the
[1:44:45] Dust of the Earth where it come from but
[1:44:49] the difference
[1:44:51] between an animal and a
[1:44:55] man you are not an
[1:45:01] animal you have flesh like an animal but
[1:45:06] you were not an
[1:45:09] animal God put a soul in a man and he
[1:45:14] didn't put it in the animal because the
[1:45:18] soul that was in the man is that
[1:45:25] theophany last one unchangeable word of
[1:45:28] God oh my you go down at the restaurant
[1:45:32] get a bowl of soup and there' be a
[1:45:34] spider in it you'd sue the
[1:45:38] restaurant then you'll let the devil
[1:45:40] cram cigarettes tobacco and sin down
[1:45:43] your throat to damn that Soul that's
[1:45:46] worth 10,000
[1:45:48] worlds and then talk about
[1:45:53] civilization oh my the wheels turn
[1:45:56] backwards again yes
