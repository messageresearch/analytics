[10:09] and sister Esther too amen I hope you
[10:12] all enjoyed and uh a lot of people came
[10:15] back and they they were sick when they
[10:18] came back but you know change of weather
[10:20] and and and being around with different
[10:23] people I guess that does it to you so
[10:26] just pray for those individuals I know
[10:27] Bella she she she fell under the weather
[10:30] a bit and and so but um we're just
[10:33] pressing on amen amen I know that they
[10:36] had a good time we had we hear good
[10:38] testimonies that came back from the um
[10:41] personal testimonies that happened even
[10:43] on my side of the family that I'm I'm so
[10:47] so happy about
[10:49] that God God definitely answers prayer
[10:52] and maybe maybe maybe we can I can touch
[10:54] upon that uh as later on in the in the
[10:57] service um I'm sure my sister wouldn't
[11:00] mind at all but uh God is God is good I
[11:04] I'll tell you this God will do whatever
[11:07] he can whatever he must do for just one
[11:11] person he he'll Shake Heaven and Earth
[11:14] just for your
[11:15] soul and I believe that he did that this
[11:17] past
[11:18] weekend and if you if you ever if you
[11:21] get a chance to even go back and watch
[11:23] the services I I I recommend that you do
[11:26] because for one you know brother brother
[11:28] Andrew Glover wasn't even supposed to be
[11:30] there Noe and he and and and brother
[11:33] Donnie Reagan was the one who was
[11:34] supposed to be there to preach and
[11:36] brother Andrew was supposed to be in New
[11:38] Zealand
[11:39] somewhere and that got cancelled so
[11:42] brother Jason Watkins asked if he could
[11:44] come and and speak at the at the at the
[11:47] at the camp so he he said yeah and
[11:51] that's exactly what my niece is
[11:55] needed that's exactly what what they
[11:57] needed not that brother Donnie Reagan
[12:00] wouldn't have done a good job or nothing
[12:02] like that no it's just that that's what
[12:03] they needed and and and you know what
[12:07] happened last week as well or two I
[12:09] guess it was last week brother Donnie's
[12:11] daughter she passed away where brother
[12:13] Donnie couldn't couldn't be there so you
[12:16] know you you might think well you know
[12:19] sad things happened but then good things
[12:22] happened in that results out of that and
[12:25] I believe that with all my heart so so I
[12:28] just thank God and give him all the
[12:29] glory for it amen praise the Lord Jesus
[12:33] amen maybe I might get into the details
[12:36] of it uh later on but let as as you're

[16:28] amen this evening Amen to keep the fire
[16:31] alive because that helps us that helps
[16:34] us and we need that in this hour amen
[16:36] amen praise the Lord Jesus so while
[16:38] you're standing let's just read real
[16:39] quickly a few verses here in in
[16:41] Leviticus chapter 6 and this was about
[16:44] this is uh in in regards to the offering
[16:47] of the daily sacrifices there uh in in
[16:51] in in the Old Testament and it says here
[16:53] in verse 8 Leviticus 6:8 and it says and
[16:57] the Lord spake unto Moses saying command
[16:59] Aaron and his sons saying this is the
[17:03] law of the burnt offering it is the
[17:05] burnt offering because of the burning
[17:07] upon the altar all night unto morning
[17:11] and the fire of the altar shall be
[17:14] burning in it amen and with that you can
[17:17] just be seated and we'll continue
[17:19] reading here
[17:20] amen and the priest verse 10 and it says
[17:23] and the priest shall put on his linen
[17:26] garment and his Lin britches shall he
[17:29] put upon his flesh and take up the ashes
[17:33] which the fire hath consumed with the
[17:36] burnt offering on the Altar and he shall
[17:39] put them beside the Altar and he shall
[17:42] put off his garments and put on other
[17:46] garments put on other garments and carry
[17:49] forth the ashes without the camp unto a
[17:51] clean place and the fire upon the altar
[17:55] shall be burning in it notice this is a
[17:58] second time is talking about that fire
[18:00] keep keep that fire burning it shall not
[18:03] be put out amen and the priest shall
[18:07] burn wood on it every morning so there
[18:10] was something that the priest had to do
[18:12] every morning in order for that fire to
[18:14] keep burning right there was something
[18:17] amen that the priest had to do
[18:18] physically and there's something that
[18:20] you and I have to do to keep going this
[18:23] fire going amen it'd be nice if God if
[18:26] we just lay in and God just lays it all
[18:28] on our lap amen but there's something
[18:30] that you and I have to
[18:32] do in order to keep this fire burning
[18:35] amen that's right and praise the Lord
[18:37] Jesus it shall not be put out by the
[18:40] Commandment of the Lord and the priest
[18:42] shall burn wood on it every morning and
[18:45] lay the burnt offering in order upon it
[18:48] and he shall burn thereon the fat of the
[18:50] peace offerings in verse 13 and it says
[18:54] the fire shall ever be burning upon the
[18:57] altar three times right three times he
[19:00] says here the fire shall ever be burning
[19:03] upon the Altar and it shall never go
[19:06] out praise the Lord Jesus amen why did
[19:09] God not want that fire to go out amen if
[19:13] you think about it the children of
[19:15] Israel at that time they were supposed
[19:17] to offer sacrifices unto the Lord amen
[19:20] and there were yearly sacrifices but
[19:22] then there were also Daily sacrifices
[19:24] that were to be offered as well by the
[19:27] priests these were the Commandments to
[19:29] the priest in order to offer daily
[19:33] sacrifices right so you you you think
[19:35] about this Saints the children of Israel
[19:38] that fire had in the altar had to keep
[19:40] burning and I can imagine the people of
[19:43] Israel outside of the outside of the
[19:45] Tabernacle outside of where where they
[19:47] would offer the the the the the
[19:49] sacrifices and they would they could be
[19:51] doing whatever the the the the father
[19:53] could be there sawing and and making
[19:56] something and the and the and the mom
[19:58] could cooking the meal and the children
[19:59] playing amen but they could just look
[20:01] back at the camp amen back where the
[20:04] where the S where the altar is and they
[20:06] could see that that fire is still lit
[20:09] they could see that that fire is still
[20:10] lit and they're like well all right the
[20:12] high priest is still doing what he's
[20:14] supposed to do the priests are still
[20:16] doing what they're supposed to do amen
[20:18] because every morning they had to go
[20:20] back there and put fire in it in order
[20:23] to keep that thing burning and it wasn't
[20:26] their idea it was a command of the Lord
[20:29] for them to keep doing that amen that
[20:32] was the only way to keep the fire
[20:33] burning Saints and amen in this day
[20:36] Saints amen there's something that you
[20:38] and I must do Amen in order to keep the
[20:40] fire of God burning in our Souls praise
[20:43] the Lord Jesus amen the the the time at
[20:45] the camp amen that was wonderful and
[20:47] that was good young people listen to me
[20:49] it was wonderful what you experienced
[20:51] and and what you went through amen but
[20:53] now you come to to to daily
[20:57] life you're back at the
[20:59] routine you're back at doing homework
[21:02] you're back at doing your your your your
[21:04] home school again you're back at at at
[21:08] brushing your teeth in your own bathroom
[21:10] now and doing everything that you were
[21:12] accustomed to doing back at church back
[21:15] at seeing the people that you see every
[21:17] week amen but it is not time amen Satan
[21:21] will come in if you're not careful and
[21:23] let's say you're back at the routine now
[21:25] let's get back to doing what you were
[21:26] doing before camp
[21:30] been there done
[21:32] that I got the t-shirt and the mouse pad
[21:36] too and the
[21:39] hat Satan That's what Satan wants you to
[21:41] do get back to your routine so get back
[21:45] to your
[21:46] coldness get back to to to to to uh to
[21:50] uh not reading the word oh that you had
[21:53] the word at the camp you had everything
[21:55] at the camp but now amen it's time to
[21:57] bring the same fire amen into your daily
[22:00] living praise God these priests had to
[22:03] keep that fire going
[22:05] daily praise the Lord amen and I like
[22:08] what it says here in verse in verse uh
[22:10] uh I'm I'm going to read it in the
[22:12] Contemporary English version because
[22:14] it's more understandable understandable
[22:16] in that in that in that version but it
[22:18] says here in verse 11 it
[22:21] says change into your everyday
[22:24] clothes the Lord was telling them to
[22:27] change they they would put the sacrifice
[22:30] or the animal there uh the night before
[22:33] and they would keep that fire burning
[22:35] and the whole night that that that
[22:37] sacrifice or that animal was burning the
[22:40] next morning the priest would come they
[22:42] would take the ashes and the Bible says
[22:45] here that he they he would they would
[22:47] have to they would have to change back
[22:49] from their Priestly clothes into every
[22:52] day
[22:52] clothes and then go back and dispose of
[22:56] the ashes amen so it's in your everyday
[23:00] walk with God Amen they still had to do
[23:02] what God
[23:03] said they still had to obey amen the
[23:06] word of the Lord because that was the
[23:07] word of the Lord to take the the sins
[23:10] and the weights that do so easily beset
[23:13] you amen and take him outside of the
[23:16] altar amen and then come back and the
[23:19] morning after amen put more wood in
[23:21] there so that fire can keep burning amen
[23:24] praise the Lord Jesus so it was their
[23:27] Duty and it was the responsibility to do
[23:29] that so that the people amen could offer
[23:31] the Lambs offer them the the the the
[23:34] things that they needed to offer in
[23:36] order to have their sins forgiven amen
[23:38] and it's up to you the Bible tells me
[23:41] Amen in Romans chap I can't remember the
[23:43] chapter but it's in Romans where Paul
[23:45] says amen that to offer yourself as a
[23:49] Living
[23:50] Sacrifice amen you must offer yourself
[23:53] as a Living
[23:55] Sacrifice praise the Lord every camp
[23:58] meeting no no every

[32:50] applies to you too because this is your
[32:52] this is the word I believe we're going
[32:54] to the greatest Youth Camp there's ever
[32:56] been amen there every exist I I believe
[32:59] that with all my heart so uh you can
[33:02] harp about youth camps you get we're
[33:03] going to one you come against them we're
[33:07] going to one and we're going to have fun
[33:09] so if you're not having fun now I don't

[33:13] we're going to enjoy ourselves amen but
[33:16] it's got to start now praise God you got
[33:18] to love the word of God now in order to
[33:20] love it there right praise God because
[33:23] nothing that doesn't love the word of
[33:24] God isn't going to be there right I'll
[33:26] just tell you that right now amen you
[33:30] enjoy amen the word enjoy being at
[33:32] church enjoy being with his people enjoy
[33:35] Fellowship praise the Lord amen amen
[33:39] hallelujah there's something about that
[33:42] amen that that that that helps you amen
[33:44] when you come to the house of God Amen
[33:46] not only is it for you to just warm a
[33:49] bench which that does happen and that's
[33:51] wonderful the bench loves you for that
[33:55] but you're here also Amen to receive a
[33:59] blessing but also to be a blessing
[34:02] somebody in here needs to receive your
[34:05] blessing the blessing does just doesn't
[34:08] come from the preacher or from the
[34:10] Deacon or from the song leader the
[34:11] blessing comes from you
[34:13] too amen so young people we need your
[34:17] blessing we need you to bless us we need
[34:21] amen every now and then amen spark us
[34:23] amen with what God has given you I want
[34:25] to learn from you amen praise God I'm
[34:29] sure any any minister or any or any
[34:32] person a true Christian amen would say
[34:34] the same thing amen I'm not too high or
[34:37] great or big amen to not learn from you
[34:41] amen I want to learn amen as much as I
[34:43] can whether they're older than me or
[34:45] younger than me but if it's something
[34:47] that's going to help me amen I want to
[34:48] know right because it's going to help me
[34:51] be more like Christ am amen that's what
[34:53] a minister truly is I've said I've often
[34:56] said it's one that one that Rose yeah
[34:59] right let me just explain that there for
[35:01] a moment one that serves amen how many
[35:04] watch that the movie benur yeah do you
[35:07] remember the the the the the that scene
[35:09] uh in benur where they were rowing in
[35:11] the boat and that gruesome scene amen
[35:15] where there was arms you know limbs cut
[35:17] off and stuff like
[35:18] that
[35:21] anyways that's not all I remember about
[35:24] Ben her
[35:25] but but there was an accident that
[35:28] happened there but as as they were
[35:29] rowing as they were rowing they were
[35:32] rowing to the tune of the one of the
[35:35] master right and they were the the the
[35:38] the one that was in charge of them and
[35:39] he was playing the drums now the word
[35:42] minister in that days if you take the
[35:44] word back Minister Minister means one
[35:46] that Rose in other words one that keeps
[35:49] in tune with the sound of the master
[35:53] Bo so if the master starts being faster
[35:57] he he he start drawing faster amen if he
[36:00] goes a little slower he goes a little
[36:02] slower amen he's only paying attention
[36:05] to the sound and to the what that Master
[36:07] is doing and beating on that thing
[36:09] because he's a minister he's ministering
[36:13] in order to keep the boat amen afloat
[36:16] cuz if he stops uh rowing amen the whole
[36:19] boat is sunk or the whole boat goes amen
[36:22] so it's important amen that us amen we
[36:25] as ministers amen we're serving you
[36:28] you're not serving us I don't want you
[36:30] to serve me I want to serve you what can
[36:33] I do Amen to help you amen amen I
[36:36] believe that that's what a true Minister
[36:38] wants to do
[36:39] amen and the greatest Minister we've
[36:42] ever had amen is the Lord Jesus
[36:45] Christ and you know what he did he
[36:47] washed dirty
[36:50] feet and he humbled himself the god of
[36:53] Glory the king of Heaven amen he got
[36:57] down and washed the disciples dirty feet
[37:00] right
[37:02] amen and why and why is it that we can't
[37:05] offer ourselves in in Full Sacrifice and
[37:08] do whatever it takes in order to
[37:11] minister back to him amen amen driving
[37:15] in a little driving a few minutes or or
[37:17] a couple of minutes Amen on two two
[37:19] nights a
[37:20] week two days a
[37:22] week some of us can't even do that I
[37:25] understand if you can't if you truly
[37:27] can't but if you can and you won't
[37:30] that's right that's the difference yeah
[37:34] amen so five sure ways to keep the fire
[37:38] alive after youth camp and my goodness
[37:40] the fire is alive under this coat I'll
[37:42] tell you
[37:46] that
[37:47] yeah praise the Lord I'm having fun
[37:50] Saints amen you guys are are pulling
[37:53] really nicely amen number one give all
[37:57] the credit to God
[37:59] Amen if God gave you something amen if
[38:02] you if you if you've truly been changed
[38:04] amen give Jesus that credit amen amen
[38:07] you didn't do nothing to to to come to
[38:10] it amen it was it was it was God Amen
[38:13] because you it's him that draws you amen
[38:17] so if the Lord amen did something for
[38:20] you at camp or any time of your life
[38:22] amen give him the credit give him the
[38:25] glory give him to honor amen amen praise
[38:28] the Lord Jesus amen in 1 Corinthians 4:7
[38:33] in the Contemporary English version it
[38:34] says this what is so special about you
[38:38] what do you have that you were not given
[38:40] and if it was given to you how can you
[38:42] brag amen how can you brag I I like
[38:45] reading it in simple terms like that
[38:47] amen so you can young people can
[38:49] understand it amen because Saints the
[38:52] the the camp can bring excitement amen
[38:54] but but the Lord amen is the the only
[38:56] one that can bring transformation in
[38:58] your life amen and and and and that's
[39:01] that's key amen the the camp can make
[39:04] you excited and it can it can start that
[39:07] in your life amen but it's it's a
[39:09] continual daily fire burning amen that
[39:11] brings transformation in your life amen
[39:14] praise the Lord and that's what we all
[39:16] want we want to be transformed and not
[39:19] conformed Amen to this world Amen but
[39:23] transformed John 3:27 says John replied
[39:26] man can receive only what is given him
[39:29] from Heaven praise God Romans 12:3 and
[39:32] as I said I can give you these and you
[39:34] can go through them yourself for by the
[39:36] grace given me I say to every one of you
[39:40] do not think of yourself more highly
[39:42] than you ought to amen but think of
[39:44] yourself with sober judgment according
[39:46] to the measure of faith God has given
[39:49] you amen amen praise the Lord amen don't
[39:52] don't don't be sad thinking that your
[39:54] experience that you had in camp that you
[39:57] left it there no that same experience
[40:00] comes with you cuz the word comes with
[40:03] you amen if and the Lord Jesus Christ is
[40:06] the same yesterday today and forever and
[40:09] he's ever presentent help in the time of
[40:11] trouble amen so don't tie it into just
[40:15] one place amen it comes with you
[40:18] wherever you go amen Psalm 461 says God
[40:21] is our refuge and strength and at very
[40:23] present help in the time of trouble John
[40:25] 16:3 tells us how be it when he the
[40:28] spirit of Truth has come he will guide
[40:30] you into all
[40:33] truth all
[40:35] truth praise the Lord Jesus I love that
[40:39] amen amen for he shall not speak of
[40:42] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[40:45] that shall he speak and he will show you
[40:46] things to come amen as I said I think a
[40:49] couple of services ago amen not just
[40:52] guide you into all truth about about his
[40:54] word amen but all truth about your life
[40:59] amen he will show you I believe that and
[41:03] maybe he he maybe he he won't maybe
[41:05] there's things because even Paul in his
[41:08] walk with Christ amen there was
[41:10] something that was happening to him that
[41:13] he didn't he asked God five times I
[41:16] believe to take it away from him and God
[41:19] told him he said my grace is sufficient
[41:22] and I don't need to explain anything to
[41:24] you you just move on with my grace Paul
[41:27] praise God so but there's other times
[41:31] where things can be expl why am I like
[41:33] this why am I why did I go through this
[41:36] what happened here amen God can reveal
[41:38] things to you but God won't reveal
[41:40] things to you outside of his word amen
[41:44] therefore it takes for you to read the
[41:45] word and stay in the word praise the
[41:47] Lord Jesus that's amen how be it oh I
[41:51] would just read this brother brand says
[41:53] this but they never in Jehovah jyra 1961
[41:56] but they never did know what it was them
[41:58] things because see it's not what good
[42:00] does it do see God gets glory and as
[42:03] long as we try to take glory in man then
[42:05] you got it all wrong right amen this is
[42:09] so important Amen to who are you looking
[42:13] at at church wherever you go who is your
[42:19] inspiration is it the Lord Jesus Christ
[42:21] or is it the man behind the
[42:23] pulpit or is it who who is it it should
[42:27] be the Lord Jesus
[42:29] Christ amen The Man Behind the pulpit
[42:31] can can go right he may not be here with
[42:34] us all the time but who's going to be
[42:35] your inspiration after that right so you
[42:39] have to have inspiration amen by God
[42:42] amen amen he be your inspiration amen
[42:46] cuz he he's he's the one that promised
[42:47] that he would be with you amen The Man
[42:50] Behind the pulpit can't be with you
[42:53] forever The Man Behind the pulpit will
[42:55] be with him at some point in time but he
[42:58] can't be with you but the Holy Ghost can
[43:01] amen praise the Lord Jesus so don't pin
[43:04] it all on just the one man pin it all on
[43:07] the Christ the son of man because then
[43:10] he'll help you praise the Lord Jesus let
[43:14] brother brandom stay out of it he says
[43:16] here I'm just skipping it here I seen
[43:17] the Lord Jesus Christ and he laid his
[43:19] hands on me I put my hands on him I
[43:21] wasn't even in the prayer line I just
[43:23] sat there and believed and he turned
[43:25] brother Brandon around and said so and
[43:27] so there you are that's it that's the
[43:28] real thing amen praise the Lord Jesus
[43:32] not knocking prayer lines that's right
[43:34] praise the Lord that's not what he
[43:35] trying to do amen but God does it the
[43:38] way he wants to do it because he knows
[43:40] what you
[43:41] need he might he might he he he might
[43:44] know he might see our young people amen
[43:47] they need something physical you can't
[43:50] take that away from them some of us
[43:53] might might be able to sit at our seats
[43:55] and believe it
[43:57] right you've you've grown into that our
[43:59] young peoples are not at that point
[44:02] therefore we can't criticize when there
[44:04] is prayer lines or when there is things
[44:06] like that we have to stay balanced
[44:09] because that's what they need later on
[44:11] let them grow to to where they can
[44:13] receive it from their seat then praise
[44:16] God so you have to amen you have to keep
[44:18] things in Balance amen because they
[44:21] we're all growing in different in
[44:23] different levels amen praise the Lord
[44:26] Jesus and number two all right we're
[44:28] moving quickly fall in love with going
[44:31] to church and I already talked a little
[44:32] bit about this but we just going to talk
[44:34] about it a little bit more amen because
[44:38] uh you know your church probably doesn't
[44:40] match up with what happened at
[44:43] Camp right hey the the the music is
[44:46] probably not the same the the the the
[44:49] the the style of preaching is probably

[1:01:51] boxes up you know you break them down
[1:01:53] and I was we was up at the top of the
[1:01:55] stairs and oh my those cardboard boxes
[1:01:58] look look good to slide
[1:02:01] down I just I wanted to my wife didn't

[1:02:09] old I got a family I got to keep
[1:02:14] going I can't break my neck right
[1:02:18] now can't do that so we're here use
[1:02:22] wisdom sometimes right got to use wisdom
[1:02:25] amen amen 1 Corinthians 10:12 says this
[1:02:30] even if you think you can stand up to
[1:02:32] Temptation be careful not to fall if you
[1:02:35] if you think you could do it don't even
[1:02:38] go there no just just stay away from it
[1:02:42] cuz it's if it was a Temptation before
[1:02:44] it's going to be a Temptation again
[1:02:46] right it's going to be a Temptation
[1:02:48] again amen number four we're moving on
[1:02:52] here find Good Company amen find friends
[1:02:57] good company good friends that you can
[1:02:59] learn from that you can grow with that
[1:03:01] you can pray with that you can amen that
[1:03:04] you can uh uh uh uh just grow together
[1:03:07] and that you can sharpen one another as
[1:03:10] the Bible says iron sharpens iron amen
[1:03:13] make sure to have positive influences in
[1:03:15] your life amen and if you don't have any
[1:03:17] influences in your life then find some
[1:03:21] if you don't have good influences in
[1:03:23] your life find them
[1:03:24] and I I think the first place to go is
[1:03:27] church that you can start right there
[1:03:30] amen amen find those positive influences
[1:03:33] in your life that you can learn from and
[1:03:35] that you know that when you're around
[1:03:36] that person your spirit isn't going to
[1:03:38] be downtrodden you're not going to be
[1:03:40] sitting there and just be made fun of
[1:03:42] you're you're going to learn something
[1:03:44] from that person find those good
[1:03:46] influences in your life amen amen amen
[1:03:50] don't don't try to make it alone no none
[1:03:53] of us can make it alone
[1:03:55] God didn't make us Amen to make it alone
[1:03:58] God didn't make us to be Islands to
[1:04:01] ourselves if that was the case he would
[1:04:03] have just made us and put us in bubbles
[1:04:05] like they were trying to do back in 2020
[1:04:08] amen that doesn't work that totally goes
[1:04:12] against what God made Humanity to be
[1:04:16] amen you can't be a bubble to yourself
[1:04:19] it's tempting to do so
[1:04:21] sometimes it's because people people get
[1:04:23] on your
[1:04:24] nerves right and sometimes we get on our
[1:04:27] nerves to to people and then you don't
[1:04:29] know
[1:04:30] that brother the boy you get on
[1:04:32] somebody's nerves I
[1:04:34] [Laughter]
[1:04:35] don't right but you that is the way to
[1:04:41] cope with those things is to be around
[1:04:43] people and have positive influences in
[1:04:46] your life amen praise God 1 Corinthians
[1:04:49] tells us this do not be deceived evil
[1:04:52] company corrupts good habits
[1:04:54] in other words bad friends bad people it
[1:04:56] corrupts what you've learned amen
[1:04:58] through your life amen it corrupts you
[1:05:01] it'll corrupt you a bad apple in a in in
[1:05:04] a good in a good batch
[1:05:06] eventually corrupts the whole batch
[1:05:09] right yeah just one bad apple right one
[1:05:12] bad friend in your life will eventually
[1:05:15] corrupt
[1:05:16] you so you've got to be you've got to
[1:05:19] watch that Proverbs 13:20 he that
[1:05:22] walketh with wise men shall be
[1:05:24] wise all right but a companion of fools
[1:05:28] shall be destroyed in other words wise
[1:05:30] friends make you wise but you hurt
[1:05:33] yourself by going around with fools
[1:05:36] righten you're hurting yourself by going
[1:05:38] around with foolish people right amen
[1:05:41] Amen
[1:05:44] brother if somebody's always got the
[1:05:47] word talking about the word of God and
[1:05:50] praying and and you see you could see it
[1:05:52] in people amen gravitate towards that
[1:05:55] person yeah amen see what you can learn
[1:05:58] amen or maybe you know that'll be a good
[1:06:01] friend to

[1:06:05] comes back to being at church for
[1:06:07] Fellowship amen it it just does that
[1:06:09] that's where you can start amen and in
[1:06:11] Proverbs 27:17 it says as iron sharpens
[1:06:13] iron so a friend sharpens a friend amen
[1:06:17] what does that mean it means you help
[1:06:19] one another amen amen iron helps to
[1:06:22] Sharp iron amen praise the Lord and
[1:06:26] going on quickly here Sam brother Brown
[1:06:28] says this Samson got into Bad Company
[1:06:31] and you always can remember that when
[1:06:32] you are in Bad Company you are out of
[1:06:34] the will of the
[1:06:36] Lord all right my old southern mam used
[1:06:39] to tell me if you lay down with a dog
[1:06:41] that's got fleas you'll get up with the
[1:06:44] fleas it's just common sense that's a
[1:06:46] rather rude expression but it's it's a
[1:06:48] good all lot of common everyday sense to
[1:06:50] it you just can't associate yourself
[1:06:53] with the things of the world and expect
[1:06:55] to stay spiritual and humble before the
[1:06:58] Lord right you're known by your company
[1:07:03] there's an old saying show me your
[1:07:05] company and I'll tell you who you
[1:07:08] are and when the church begins to keep
[1:07:10] company with the world and it's no more
[1:07:12] than the world it gets out of the
[1:07:13] Fellowship of the Holy Spirit gets out
[1:07:15] of the company of God and and of angels
[1:07:18] and of God's Heritage when it begins to
[1:07:20] flirt as Samson did amen amen amen amen
[1:07:24] so who is someone that that that that
[1:07:26] you can turn to amen that can help you
[1:07:28] be that influence amen that can help you

[1:08:37] experience that you've had there at Camp
[1:08:40] amen much of what happened there was
[1:08:42] because the word of God you were exposed
[1:08:44] to the word of God right right a lot of
[1:08:47] the word of God was being exposed amen
[1:08:49] but I I've got good news the word of God
[1:08:53] goes home with
[1:08:55] you the word of God didn't stay over
[1:08:57] there the Bible comes home with you amen
[1:09:01] so that so you amen can continue that
[1:09:05] same exposure amen open the word of God

[1:13:56] amen let me tell you what
[1:13:59] Saints you know and brother Wade read it
[1:14:02] this this past Sunday amen but you know
[1:14:04] that the disciples and Jesus when they
[1:14:06] went to mount
[1:14:08] Transfiguration they had a little camp
[1:14:10] meeting there did you know
[1:14:12] that you know we know all the all all
[1:14:14] that that that represents and and but
[1:14:17] but but you know it was a little camp
[1:14:18] meeting for them and Jesus personally
[1:14:21] invited them to go to the camp Meeting
[1:14:24] those three disciples I was three or
[1:14:26] four disciples I can't remember Peter
[1:14:28] James and John I believe amen
[1:14:31] three and Jesus transfigures himself in
[1:14:35] other words changes before him before
[1:14:38] them
[1:14:39] amen praise God they didn't even know
[1:14:43] amen Jesus did all that for them and
[1:14:45] they get excited they get excited about
[1:14:49] God and they say and they say Lord
[1:14:52] because Elijah and and Moses they appear
[1:14:55] as well amen they even joined the camp
[1:14:58] meeting they even wanted to join that
[1:15:01] camp meeting was so good I mean
[1:15:02] everything was I mean they was having a
[1:15:05] good time it excited amen uh uh Peter
[1:15:08] and they say let's let's make three
[1:15:10] Tabernacles here one for you Jesus one
[1:15:12] for you Elijah and one for for Moses and
[1:15:15] it got him excited amen and all of a
[1:15:18] sudden amen the the voice comes out and
[1:15:21] says this is my beloved
[1:15:24] son hear ye him amen it ain't not about
[1:15:28] you Peter it's not about what you want
[1:15:31] and it's not about Moses all about Moses
[1:15:33] it's not about all about Elijah it's
[1:15:34] about the Lord Jesus Christ he is the
[1:15:38] one that you need to keep your eyes
[1:15:39] focused on Amen the Bible says amen that
[1:15:43] they got scared amen they were terrified
[1:15:46] when they heard that voice amen but then
[1:15:49] Jesus amen comes up and and opens up and
[1:15:51] says there was nobody left but Jesus and
[1:15:54] says fear not I'm here amen but he says
[1:15:59] don't tell this to anybody no and they
[1:16:02] went down the they went down the
[1:16:03] mountain back to the mountain and I bet
[1:16:06] you Peter amen it was it was a quiet
[1:16:08] walk back down the mountain I'm
[1:16:11] sure man I did we just see what we just
[1:16:15] saw I mean Jesus am man he had white
[1:16:17] vestures a cloud around
[1:16:20] him
[1:16:22] amen just like your brother said ain't
[1:16:24] nobody going to believe
[1:16:27] us we ain't how who are we going to tell
[1:16:31] this about to to what are we going to
[1:16:33] say but see it was their own
[1:16:35] experience but let me tell you what they
[1:16:38] saw great things up in that up in that
[1:16:41] camp meeting yeah but it's still they
[1:16:44] still had to continue walking with Jesus
[1:16:47] in order to get to Pentecost to receive
[1:16:49] the Holy Ghost to be born again that
[1:16:52] experience as good as it was and as
[1:16:54] everything that they saw Jesus
[1:16:56] transfigured before they still had to be
[1:16:58] born
[1:17:00] again so let me tell you Saints young
[1:17:03] people you went to the camp meeting you
[1:17:06] got to make sure no matter what you felt
[1:17:08] no matter how good you felt how much you
[1:17:11] jumped how much you shouted that is all
[1:17:14] good that is the you needed that so that
[1:17:18] you can continue
[1:17:19] on to go get the new birth
[1:17:23] maybe you did get the new birth there
[1:17:26] but only that's between you and God that
[1:17:28] experience amen that Peter and the
[1:17:30] disciples receiv received that was only
[1:17:31] between them and Jesus that's why Jesus
[1:17:33] said don't tell this to nobody until the
[1:17:35] the son of man be risen from the dead
[1:17:37] again amen that was between them and God
[1:17:40] Amen and so what you experienced was
[1:17:42] between you and God but keep that thing
[1:17:45] going do you you you you see Peter and
[1:17:48] the disciples they had to keep that
[1:17:50] going and I'm sure they would never they
[1:17:53] never probably stopped thinking about
[1:17:54] that it took them amen that that that's
[1:17:58] that that probably that thing held Peter
[1:18:00] even though he he he he denied the Lord
[1:18:03] three times even even though amen he he
[1:18:06] did he tried to back away from even
[1:18:07] serving from I'm going back fishing but
[1:18:11] he probably would thought think about
[1:18:12] but I saw him transfigured I even saw
[1:18:15] Moses and Elijah there with him amen how
[1:18:18] can I leave this word where else can I
[1:18:20] go he's the only one that has the word
[1:18:23] of eternal life
[1:18:25] amen Jesus knew that about
[1:18:28] Peter amen and therefore amen he was
[1:18:32] able to go up to the upper room yes sir
[1:18:34] and receive the promise of God
[1:18:36] personally so he wasn't now just looking
[1:18:38] at the Jesus before them but now is
[1:18:41] Jesus amen inside of them by the by the
[1:18:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's
[1:18:46] what's the best amen that's what will
[1:18:49] keep you amen that's the true experience
[1:18:54] amen the the the the indwelling of the
[1:18:56] holy spirit because if we could see
[1:19:00] Jesus we could see lights we could see
[1:19:01] all kinds of stuff that but that won't
[1:19:03] save you though that didn't save
[1:19:06] Peter but it's the indwelling of the
[1:19:09] Holy Ghost that's what will keep you so
[1:19:12] young people amen keep the fire lit amen
[1:19:15] keep it alive keep putting that wood in
[1:19:17] it amen and I promise you you'll be
[1:19:20] become more like that fire that's right
[1:19:23] and who is that fire amen the Lord Jesus
