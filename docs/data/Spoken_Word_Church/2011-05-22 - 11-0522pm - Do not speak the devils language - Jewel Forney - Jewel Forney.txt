TRANSCRIPT
========================================
jesus said here i said to you they have out of word a man shall speak they shall give an account in the day of judgment right right now the prophet exodus and by the bible hey the bible says jesus say let your yes be yes and nobody knows some people got a yes and enough for everything some people know everything if you ask them a question they just knew it yeah it right or wrong but they got to know it how did it show it anyway that will become oh you know one thing you know joking about maybe something that's fiction a fiction joke but you know but to tell something that's true that happened you know and the things happening it's just funny in life you know worse you know i mean this thing happened for that funny life i tell the story of my own uh i don't want them i got the attitude i was looking in the mirror i weighed about 270 pounds and i was flexed there must have been a spirit talking to me because i saw myself like tony atlas and i was just standing in front of that mural and the devil was saying look at this you're a tony atlas and my wife walked in there and she says to me i hope you don't think you look good you know he said he's in anything not the joker would want to see god will make you give and account for every other word that you speak do not do that the bible says that you have to give an account for every other word so what what kind of people we ought to be people that frankly stern love and sweet kind never never a bunch of nurses always going along so we got to bring it to the point that lord i'm trying to get my mind in order i'm trying to keep myself here the best thing for me to know if i don't see it in the word let me leave it alone we don't want to get in to that but the question is just evening young people all people just saying the only thing that we got that we know is true is the holy spirit we can hear these outer words out of this come here uh jesus is coming on a uh this year and somebody tried to put a date on it somebody said he's out in the desert at least they don't even go out there and believe that he said that's out of work how did they say he's in the secret bride trent chamber he tell us not to even believe in things why because where he is he's not in the secret bride trainer he's not in the desert he's in you so we just need ask god to open the eyes of my heart and let me see jesus christ in me hey you know we need to see jesus christ i mean the only way i want to see jesus christ i got to find somebody with the baptism that holy ghost right i gotta find somebody that got the word on the inside we don't realize the significance of somebody you know sometimes we got somebody that we're against you know and then you know we don't realize what we say and we shouldn't we should if we got somebody with just we need to get on our needs and pray to god to take and give me creating me a clean heart so i can deal with it so we'll see that person that we're against and the first thing we shake his head what we say god bless you well you should not bless you know what he's gonna be blessed and you think oh why you ain't dealing with it because you keep blessing him how did because if you keep saying bless him he's going to keep on getting good of him out of your own mouth you need to curse or bless somebody right how did the old testament i said sometimes if you know we need we need to do this what are we doing now yeah we we we dedicate our children we dedicate them to the lord we say lord i want you to put a blessing on this child i look through life in here we try to dedicate them and put a blessing on them how do we try to dedicate their blessings our main word international word is god bless you and the people just keep getting blessed and then they just keep on getting blessed because why it's in your mouth something that you don't like you got to say lord give me the divine love that i can overcome this spirit you've got to speak it so your body can come to it right honey it don't just happen by accident a chance you've got to speak the word right we we got to come to that point you know how we get a bad service you know what korea had a bad service the mouth right and i'm so tired because i'm sitting back in the office i'm getting asleep so good what talking about here they speak their way out of it i don't feel like i just feel like tonight after they think the church is going to be so down speak that right speak that and you will create an atmosphere to pull the spirit of god down i have no idea you come back in here on a sunday evening have you done it real good and the only thing that everybody on their mind a big fluffy king-sized mattress but the point of it is the people cursed your own self right it ain't god putting it on you god has healed you but they just how you feeling i'm sick but thinking this sickness to say that you got to curse your own self because you've got power either out of your mouth to is that my power in your words and we all got to come through that and i got to go do that right lord let me get control of my tongue and the only thing that can control the tongue is the baptism of the holy ghost i preached a message years ago no nobody ever preaching him but the one thing i the message i picked years ago that what out what adam lost control of was the power of this term because adam was created to speak the word and adam lost control of the power of the speech right adam should have been able to speak and the devil should have left right right adam had power to get rid of the devil right now do you realize that you're right out of them had power to get rid of the devil adam i'm giving you dominion over the fishes i'm giving you dominion on the peace of the field i'm giving you the media adam the word of god is in your mouth he had to probably get rid of it i don't want you to exist anymore it wouldn't have been no such thing as a devil right he had the word to speak about existence exactly how god gave him that dominionship now god has given you the same diminishing he giving you power over the flesh over the devil and over the world now how you gonna overcome the world the same way that jesus did jesus had to speak the word get behind me say get the head it is written amen how did he had to speak the word i didn't in order for us to get rid of the word the world has bought enough we got to start speaking the word holly young people if you battle with rock and roll music you battle with lush you fighting with internet pornography or whatever it is only when you can help them come over come here you got to raise up and make them in your mind greatness in me the heathens in the world you've got to start telling your faith you want your body amen exactly i told you no i believe i told this the last time i was here but didn't i tell you i said when i was a when i was out here before i was saved one of my main things i was a football player fan i was a baseball fan you know i didn't do nothing never really interest me i was into boxing i love boxing it just wanted everybody at the end today oh i love boxing i mean i i just love boxing and uh and one of my greatest the most man i admired the most when i was in the world and i was into the boxing the man i gave the most respect for he was the coldest of the greatest all right anybody right old man muhammad ali and i said what made him the greatest it ain't because somebody told him he was great and then because somebody educated him he was great what made him great he declared himself right he told himself i am the greatest right that's all you have to do tell yourself you don't have to be defeated by circumstances all right everybody had their opinion about that everybody said what was he talking about what made him think he's the greatest he believed it right he believed that he was the greatest and because he believed it his body was a common subject to the confession now confession is something you don't change right so when muhammad ali got defeated he never accepted the defeat he never got down in the body and he never went back on his testimony he got up because he did not realize he was being beat he didn't realize that he was defeated right so when he got back up since he didn't realize anything he declared himself i'm still great right you said but man you just got beat but he didn't know it right how can you get beat by the devil when you don't know it right how the only reason you get beat you know you got beat and you get up and you can thank that the devil knocked you down honey have you ever done this to me i'm a muhammad ali he did not confess i've been beat he got up with the confession i'm the you greatest and he didn't even know what you know he didn't even have the message he believed in the different bible did you believe but he had faith in what he believed and he took his confession and he made his body come subject to that right and only not only did muhammad ali believe it that he was the greatest comer but muhammad ali would be fighting if you ever seen him been fighting she stand up in your mouth i'm glad i can beat you he always be leaning on a man like this and you think he's just leaning he's not resting he's telling this man in his ear i'm the greatest he'll leave it in i'm the greatest you've ever seen what is he doing he's not only telling himself he's great he's making his his opponent believe that he's a great guy he put his idea in his mind honey he's making his opponent testify that he's aggressive george foreman said when he fight muhammad ali george foreman says he would hit muhammad ali with everything he had he's i was giving muhammad ali my best and he says to enjoy it as you foreign oh honey he's not hard as you can hit george oh george are you hitting like a girl he hit and what he in the world you've got a right to confess he made his opponent confess that he was grace and i looked at it i look at hypocrisy at the end of the day they brought george foreman they broke ken norton they brought speech they brought home they brought all those former fighters that he didn't fight it and he sat down around the table and every one of the guys had been joe frazier that would have got one time been a champion and they standing right there sitting around the table and muhammad ali said now and he's looking at him and they tell him how they were degrading and what they did in that day and mom and dad looked at the whole table he's hiding the greatest and they want i am the greatest greatest he is in me the heathens in the world would not he would not accept defeat on any grounds he did not decept defeat or any ground he would not even let his dream yeah he would not even let a dream defeated he told this young man he says you know how we all have dreams we all get big ideas muhammad ali one year he said if you ever have a dream and you go in your subconscious and you go to sleep and if you ever dream that you beat me and knock me out he said when you wake up from your sleep you go to the mirror and you apologize to me yeah i'm happy now that you let the devil i'm gotta pull we gotta say amen to the word of god we're gonna do the pools and presents and when god come into the congregation anything happen but we gotta we gotta release something we gotta let god know how long some young person you don't have to go down the druid range you don't have to go down to the coast of this world right all you need to do is who inside of you start speaking great as he has in me how he is in the world make your body all right you are not just a conqueror you are more than a cousin the devil don't want you to believe that he don't want you to talk about that because he if he didn't know if you started saying i'm more than a cover your body gonna come something today young lady he knows these thoughts saying that your body gonna come something today the devil don't want you to speak to
