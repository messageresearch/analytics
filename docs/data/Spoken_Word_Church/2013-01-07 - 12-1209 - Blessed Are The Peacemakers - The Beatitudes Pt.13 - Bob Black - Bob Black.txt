========================================

all right we're still having issues with the computer so just do the video this morning I don't have any slides so we'll just discuss you can see you yeah I can see myself she's kind of scary we're on Matthew chapter five Matthew chapter 5 of Beatitudes the last time we were talking about the pure and heart shall see God and I put the Zodiac in there not really it wasn't really a lesson on the Zodiac it was a lesson on seeing God when God opens things to you then you can see him and maybe unexpected places when he comes into your in your life in your heart and like that Deacon and brother downstairs you can see him uh in your life and nature and just everywhere you look you can see them in places where other people can you know many times you might be in church and uh the holy spirit will just drop down right on you and open up something to you that the person right next to you might not see in the way that you see it right because um God is opening up and in that way you in that moment you God opened something up to you that um makes it personal to you and then uh we're going through the Beatitudes blessing of the poor in spirit blessed are they they're more and blessed are the meat blessed are they which hunger and thirsty for righteousness for they shall be filled and now you're filled with the Holy Ghost and you become merciful you can show Mercy you're pure in heart and now we're on first nine ballistic are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God and peacemakers because God gives you peace and God give you uh you know think about during the creation um and just all of the stories in the Old Testament all the way up to uh this this time when Jesus was made manifest to the world he came to the Earth in a little manger and at that time all down through history as usual looking back at their history at the writings of Joshua and all of their the Old Testament history of how they Ward with the Gentiles and there was no peace in the Earth and and uh then the Shepherds were in the field and an angel came to them and said um he told them where to look there's going to be a you go into the City and you'll find a little baby in a manger and all of a sudden a host of angels appeared and said glory to God in the highest and peace on Earth a good will toward men because all the all down through history man had been uh trying to get to God trying to come into the get into the holy of holies where we could have fellowship with God and it was a great goal between us and God and uh what the Angels were declaring was that our our warrant against the Flesh and all of this uh warring in ourselves was going to come to an end by this little baby in a Manger who's going to come and bring peace in our lives set up one day a new kingdom on Earth where peace would rain but uh first peace would have to come into our hearts where um Peace by the Holy Ghost you know you go through when you're seeking the Holy Ghost you're uh your uh wondering your uh like going through the the holy place in the in the Tabernacle where there was no place to rest there's you either got the table of showbread and uh all the different all the different uh Furnitures and in the Holy place the only place to rest was on the mercy seat that was the only seat in the Tabernacle the only only resting place the only place that you can find true peace is in Christ now let me pull out my notes so um the Shepherds were in the field and the angel declared look for the Angels declared glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace and Welding toward them in now in this day of all days pieces is so uh it's it's so uh it's something the world can't understand it's like like Rahab when she was actually on the wall but she had peace because she had that little cord hanging outside of her window and now we uh you look around and you see all the turmoil and uh worry about who's going to be the next president and uh all of the different earthquakes and diverse places and things that the prophets foretold at the end time and the only only way to have true peace the only way to rest easy at night is to have the peace that only comes from God and God wants us to have peace he doesn't want us to uh there's so many promises that if you read through the New Testament about having peace in your life and if you have peace in your life then you will make peace you're not when people say ill about you you don't rile up and and uh oh I'm gonna face because you're spitting mine that kind of thing and God Christ was our example when he was here on the Earth all the time uh but it's interesting that it's kind of paradoxical paradoxical paradoxical because the the Declaration from the Angels was peace on Earth oh um all you don't have peace now you all these through history you've Ward and things but now a savior is coming to give you peace but in Luke 12 51 Jesus says suppose ye that I am come to give peace on Earth but I tell you Nave but rather division far from his fourth there shall be five in one house divided three against two and two against three the father shall be divided against the sun and the son against the father the mother against the daughter and the daughter against the mother the mother-in-law gets her daughter-in-law and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law because when God gives you that peace then it creates divisions it just naturally creates enmity with those that don't have the same peace the people that you work with see uh it causes strife and division it's just a natural law in the in the beginning when God created he made life to come into existence and then he separated the light from the darkness it's like when he shines the light of the Gospel into your soul then you become separated from Darkness from the things of the world I mean job 22 21 he said acquainted now thyself with him and be at peace thereby good shall come unto thee and in Colossians 1 19 23 for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in heaven and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked works yet now hath you reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unbelievable in his sight if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of gospel which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven Paul the peace comes from being reconciled to God by the Holy Ghost thank you and it uh like Paul said it's it's to them that will receive it in uh Shalom 1964 brother Brown said remember when the full Bible listen and closing when this full Bible has been thoroughly Vindicated then there will be an eternal Shalom Eternal peace he come and said he was peace on Earth a good will towards man but the world didn't receive it see he was peace to everyone that come to him for peace see peace on Earth to build a will to man he was the Peace at that new year beginning New Year of God thank you I believe that God wants us to have peace in our lives you um he doesn't want us to have to struggle with sleeping or not he uh you know you hear about or maybe you've had problems sleeping at night and things going through your mind and and uh you know we've all struggled with that but God's promises are to give us to give us peace and uh he will give that to us I believe Mark 4 38 39 said he was in the Hindu part of the ship this is a story of Jesus when uh they took a little trip they went they were going to take a trip in the boat to go across a body of water and along the way a storm came up and uh just like Rahab on the wall they looked around and everything around him was internal maybe we could see the same kind of thing in our lives today y'all everything around this world system seems to be just falling apart but um in our lives if we're safe inside of him we should be we should have the same kind of peace that The Peacemaker had when he was in that boat down in the bowels of it and they wanted to find out where is Jesus was he all upset was he all worried about everything and they went down and they found him asleep on a pillow in the bottom of the ship because he is the author of IRS he is The Peacemaker when they went down to wake him up and said they awake him and say in a master care is not that we perish and he arose now remember we were talking about how John and uh and Jesus when they were at the River Jordan they both knew what their place was they both knew what they were supposed to do remember brother Randall talked about how David when he had been anointed he didn't fear the life because he knew what his place was in life he knew what he was supposed to do and I wonder if maybe when we get on the other side if we could look back and see how God guided our path through life maybe we wouldn't worry so much about things that happened to us now and Jesus knew when he was on that ship he knew what his purpose in life was he knew that nothing was going to happen to that while he was on it and he arose now the piece that was inside of him because he is The Peacemaker he'll sleep on the pillar when he arose a piece that was inside of him came out and he arose and reviewed the wind and set under the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm now if he's The Peacemaker and we have The Peacemaker inside of us and we will be peacemakers just like he was or he is because he's the same yesterday today and forever Philippians 4 6-7 he said be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving lets your request be made known unto God and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus and I was I was looking at this last night and I was listening to some music while I was studying and just as I got to this scripture it the the music started playing oh what piece we often for first oh what needless pain we bear all because we do not carry Everything To God In Prayer and you know the man that wrote that song is he he was going to get married if you hadn't heard the story he was going to get married and the day before his wedding his wife his fiancee died and then he came from Europe to the states and he fell in love again he was going to get married to this girl and she died and um and and then his mother fell ill and he wrote a poem called pray unceasing or pray without ceasing and they originally put that form to Words which became this song of what peace we offered forfeit and I believe that he had a revelation of what peace comes peace doesn't come from the things of the world it comes from being settled in God laughs and uh out you know I was reading this in Philippians but be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be known unto God so why are you in your prayer with Thanksgiving because you believe that the things that you ask for God will bring to pass and brother Branham said the start to begin your prayer when you pray you may be wondering how should I pray he said start your prayer off with praise and then ask the things that you need of believing and then according to Philippians finish up with Thanksgiving because the things that you if you come to God with faith and you believe that he will give it to you according to his promises in the Bible then thank him for it and uh he'll bring it to pass the whole purpose of the Gospel is peace in Romans 10 15 and he said how should they preach he said maybe sin as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things in Ephesians 1 9-10 having made known as The Mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one thing all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on Earth even in him because that was the purpose that was the Declaration that the Angels made to the Shepherds that this Rift that was between us and God we couldn't have Fellowship that was his purpose to bring peace to unite everything back together all in him our lives and uh you just to bring to make him all at all and then uh I'll finish up real quick so that um we can do the little a little bit of thing in 1955 the uncertain sound brother Branham said that a Believer will make peace just like Jesus did when he was on the boat every man or woman that's ever tried to live for God is accused of ungodly things he's a witch he Bewitched in Greece he had so much power of God in him so much not witchery but what was it the hidden power of God that was in him he looked like a man he eat like a man he slept like a man he cried like a man he was in him he was a man but God was in his man the blessing was in the man blessed is the man said David no uncertainty to him that man knows what he's talking about I don't care what the world says what you say about him try to make you mad you won't get mad I don't care how much you talk about it he won't pay no attention to it he will go on because he's got a blessing in here he will pray for you that's right you might do anything in the world he paid he never pay no attention to it he won't back by his neighbors and go around and stir up trouble he will be a peacemaker he will do everything he can for he's a child God blessed is that man you can see how the blessed is the are the peacemakers ties into the the final the eighth beatitude blessed are they that are persecuted now when they persecute you and you will be persecuted as a Christian because it's a promise from God you will people will say hateful things about you and uh I was watching one of the uh years ago there was this brother at brother business church that the people that worked with him would take him out and throw him in the dumpster because he was a Christian and uh maybe you might not have had something that bad happen in your life but um we'll talk about that in the next couple more lessons how you will be persecuted and uh I'm gonna turn it over to June times
