brother Stevens he's used to teaching because he's brother Jason's a really good teacher and he's on series and I'm on series part 69 when we're all Southerners so we're all slow even y'all lower Alabama ones and all you ones from South Carolina we're from Georgia so we're just a little bit slow but that's all right the turtle always wins a race in that book I have never read that book where the hair ever won the turtle won the race every time even when I was a little kid mom would read it to me the turtle one I read into my granddaughter the turtle one and yes there were books when I was a little kid okay sorry hmm she here yes Josiah's girlfriend's here okay your mama June up here taking care of you when your real Mama's not here good to have you here sister Watkins talk about her daddy and she's back there oh boy good to have you I didn't say I didn't say you about that but good to have you with us so let's read the scripture and be seated but we're on the topic of who is this son of man and we've started this series 69 weeks ago and we haven't even got to the first virtue yet so but we're trying to get a foundation and today we're going to talk a little bit more about that Foundation but we're looking at the scripture and John once and then the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made in your flesh two thousand years ago is good that's fine but if he's not coming your flesh amen then he came for naught he came so that what you and I could be his victory you and I could be his glory amen and the Word was made flesh so let's not take two thousand years ago we're going to take it today and dwelt Among Us that's the you that's why I said shake your hand shake the hand to God I'm not worthy well the Bible says you are amen amen like brother John said the whole the whole program's been right here the whole time right here amen no self-help book we don't need Joel Olsteen or somebody tell us how to live better we need the Bible amen and the Word was made flesh and Goth among us and we behold his glory which is today the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth go ahead and be seated and we'll read these first Thessalonians 4 verse 4 says that every one of you should know look how positive that is should know how to possess his vessel now not your neighbors not your wife Not Your Daughters not your neighbor yours how to possess your vessel in sanctification and honor Romans 12 verse 2 says be not conformed to this world that's what we've been talking about for the past few weeks and we'll continue on a little bit more and I want to speak maybe next Sunday on a topic that's maybe a little bit strange but but it all connects together but the power of a thought think of the power of a thought because what brother Brown say he said it was a thought first then it became a word then it became expressed and the Word was thought of before the foundation of the world but that world that word became flesh when he spoke through Isaiah and said a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a child all right but be not conformed to this world but be what transformed not just turn over a new Leaf not just have a good thought like we're going to talk about next Sunday Lord with him by the renewing of your mind the Bible tells us which folks have the what the mind of Christ by the renewing of your mind because you were born this way right here with my hand you were born this way yes everybody in this building came the same way all right there's no secret to that every person except for Jesus Christ that ever began by desire everybody with me all right so you've got to have a renewing of that carnal mind because that carnal mind is what it's enmity it's a division between you and God that God put there that's right but God had a plan pray to God God had a plan and a purpose the prophet of God told us and he sent us a prophet to make that purpose not different to but to make it more clear than any other person ever brought on the face of the third they never understood Jesus Christ because they didn't have the new birth so I said we spent so many of those 69 sermons probably what 50 of them was on you must be born again you're right because brother Brown said you got to be born again not in your spirit but in your soul right you gotta what by the renewing of your mind that you may want that you may prove yes yeah you may prove it's in your lap now we know God's infinite we know he's Eternal we know he never makes a mistake we know he never never had a bad thought what about me and you he's going to transfer that to me and you and if we have the mind of Christ we're supposed to think like god wow prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God Matthew 12 34 we'll get to these a little bit later old Generation of Vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart all right out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh your thoughts come from your listen your thoughts do not originate in your brain whoa you're all enough your thoughts originate in that inside guy your brain is just a computer that you punched in just like you do now it's a hard drive you have to punch in the information then it spits it out and sometimes we do spit out some misinformation and everybody says amen all right good so I want to make sure we're still in this message Church I'll ask her several times brother Steve how many people believe brother Brown was the prophet make sure you raise your hand okay for how the abundance please do for how the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh look a good man out of the good Treasure of the heart not not this thing that but the center of you the cardia we're going to talk about in just a minute before they get to work Cardiology from a good man out of the good treasure the heart bringeth forth good things an evil man out of the evil treasure that's where we were before we were born against everybody say Amen all of us we our thoughts were evil continually nobody with me now listen we may still have those evil thoughts oh if you hadn't please pray for me okay please pray for me all right I just don't express them like I used to express them before because what because like we were talking last Sunday that fountain that water has been made what it's not bitter anymore that Fountain is a Fountain of Living Water that Fountain is something that we want you to drink from that's what we're going to get to Virtue if we ever get to it we'll get to Virtue that is that fountain that everybody wants to drink from all right now the statue of perfect man brother I'm tells us so now that's the way it is trying to manufacture Christianity listen I don't want any feathers to stuck in no I want the eagle feathers that's already produced from the eagle all right if you've got eagle feathers and you're an eagle and you got eagle feathers yeah but if you're just chicken and you stuck some eagle feathers in you start coming to a message church and wearing your hair long and dressed anyway I don't want that from the abundance of the heart amen the mouth speaketh and you and there's one thing for sure for those of you that are visiting today I told the church first of the year right what did I tell you let it out whatever you got inside of you it's going to come out anyway just let it out whether it be bad that's okay if you let it out and then if it's good you let it out so that others can what drink from your fountain or can smell your roses or smell your Lily or whatever you want to say so the first thing you got to do is what be born again you got to be changed you're not just going to say you're not going to take just a mind change though it's a heart that's why God chose the heart Satan chose what the mind and that's what we're the greatest battle ever fought is is not in Warfare out there it's in the Battle of your mind because listen that's where your thoughts originate from the heart now here we have a chart that's what we've been talking about for 69 sermons but we started down here at the foundation and we believe here in this church that you got to be born again we don't believe that you came here with this eternal life in you no you came with representation you came with the foreknowledge thought of God that that seed was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world but you were born lost I was born dead or I didn't need Sanctified I was born there I didn't need Justified and I was born dead if I didn't need a new birth my first birth would have been right the first time that's right that's right and man we know those quotes we know those things but I want us to understand you were lost you were lost as lost could be before God got a hold of you and said hey be my child and you either what you either chose to be or not to be right amen and we hope today that them too say I will Over Yonder and I do okay that's a choice they're gonna have to make a life choice I like that let's get brother John one more hand that was good I enjoy I enjoy you know I uh me and Jim we started with Financial Peace a long long time ago and we taught some of the courses and and uh and they're all biblical it's not just a self-help book I mean it's all all biblical that you need to what you need to not be Laden with dead I know we do have some debt we've got your house payment you but you don't need four cars with four car payments everybody say Amen all right just want to make sure we're still in the same place where John brother John was from the same we went and went and switched buildings but but we we go back to where brother Branham was telling us and I just tried a background a little bit for the ones that's not been here that that we believe in justification sanctification we believe in the new birth and we believe that that starts at Faith not up here at the top of the pyramid it seals you more at the top of the pyramid it sells those virtues inside of you everybody with me say Amen all right and then brother Brown told us said that God came back on the day of Pentecost or Jesus did as the Holy Ghost most as the Son of God dispensation is everybody with me now that was the spirit gods that came inside those 120 in the upper room and gave them the new birth and it's been giving the new birth all the way up through the church ages but now in the end time we got to look at another dispensation change and that would be the son of man they didn't get the revelation of Son of Man the son of man stood on Earth word was made flesh dwelt among us there was The Headstone there were the seals there were all the all the revelation of God was standing in Jesus Christ right but he went away and came back to be the what foundation stone or the Cornerstone of the church but in the end time according to what Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 7. God was going to come back in the end time and write all the wrongs because remember under the Son of God revelation there was some father-son Holy Ghost baptism going on there was some trinitarian Doctrine going on hello somebody but God honored that and the prophet said winked at their ignorance knowing that you and I though he's not weakening our ignorance today you're not ignorant if you've been in the message church at least a year you should not be ignorant of these trinitarian doctrines and all the other things that we've that we take for granted right so the Son of God Revelation could not take a body change there's no way you can have your body changed with with false Doctrine inside of you everybody with me but now the son of man Revelation I asked you many times before how many times was Jesus wrong how many times did he say well I didn't do what my father said today I think I just did what I wanted to do did he no no he said how old I only do that what the father tells me to do I owe somebody and that's what's going to happen to me and you we've got to subject our Humanity that's why we've got to have renewing of our mind because remember the virtue here on the pyramid is not being a virgin you'll be a virgin all the days of your life and die and go to hell sure you can have knowledge Temperance there's a lot of people that that have bad temper but there's a lot of people in this earth it's not even born again that you could beat them up over the head throw them under a truck and they wouldn't they just say okay because brother Ralph said some of these virtues are naturally given but when you get born again what's going to happen when you get born again you come under that change and you got to now become aware of that temper come on somebody listen to getting a new birth didn't do away with your temper if it did some of y'all needs Born Again get born again I said some of us I'm sorry some of us but what he's still working on me right but the son of man Revelation is what came back in the end time let's just bring it all back together to the opening of the seals because the seals are Jesus Christ the seals are what the sealing of the book of redemption it's opening that book so that we can read it and read that there was no trinitarian Doctrine listen do you know what we'll talk about next Sunday do you know that thought that they had that thought that they had at nicaea was the thought of the devil but the religious World accepted it so the thought of God had to come back in the end time through a little man yeah and that pure God of God he would speak and he'd say hey I saw you yesterday you were outside you had on a red shirt you live at 4 26. where'd that come from I didn't come from William Branham but remember that wasn't his message that was to get the attention of the people bait on the hook he said not in the years of preparation not in the healing campaign but when the word what the son of man when he stood one day and he said I had my father are one Amen brother Brown said he said when the bride says I am my father are one and these other things she'll be an invincible Army I'll tell you some of the visitors here I know you all know it but I think as the Bride of Jesus Christ we beat the Oneness up we beat the trinitarians up but we've been tuned this our whole life Jesus over yondering us over here and y'all even understood I said Yonder and you understood what I said but Jesus over there me over here I'm not worthy I'm this I'm not I'm this I'm not bury Johnson father I pray that they may be one they as we are one now how was the father in Jesus one no one we are the further manifestation of God through Jesus Christ everybody with me we are not Tunas we're Oneness true Oneness Adam and Eve were truly one they were literally bone of the bone and flesh of the flesh they literally had their own DNA now you and me and my wife been married 43 years Mom and Dad have been married 60 something years some of you have been married a long time but you never won you'll have two dnas you'll have two thoughts you'll have two ideas oh come on somebody say Amen okay all right I stopped me and Jim was the only one I'm glad to worry about it here but uh Adam and Eve though were one body but yet two separate beings standing here brother Brown said that's true Oneness true Oneness was God could come down talk to Adam and Eve in the garden treat them co-equal somebody only after the fall wasn't like this but co-equal so what about the Bride of Jesus Christ no heirs and Joint heirs with Christ whatever he gets we get he got a body change we get a body change he was the son of man we're the son of man [Applause] so now we've looked at a higher form of justification a higher form of sanctification not that we just Die daily but that sanctification has totally wiped the thing out brother Brown said the real you didn't do it amen amen and you got to realize that oh but I was just thinking the other day how bad I was God did extremely we go fishing a lot of times and to see a forgetfulness we go dragging all that old stuff back out and God's like can you just leave it alone stop fishing in this Pond all right I can't remember what you did what a mighty God Amen so now what are we doing we're not we're not we're not we're on the Son of God Revelation but we're heading toward the son of man we're the son of man where we're going to watch speak the word and what the Rapture is going to take place but we're going to speak the word first and the resurrection is going to take place listen we in this church believe one thing for sure I'm not looking for the rapture boy get them quiet and for Rapture Rapture is a culmination of the body change uh them coming out of the ground first so let's preach Resurrection then let's preach body change then let's get out of here because Rapture is ecstasy it means what the culmination the height the what something you want you're going up to but we got to get the dad out of the ground first listen you gotta destroy death in this thing first and through the son of man Revelation that's exactly what we're going to do so let's move on if that's all right y'all foreign the other day we were talking about the three Hebrew children brother Brown was telling a wonderful story and I've just got part of it so I'll paraphrase some of it you know y'all all knew what I was talking about what happened with the three Hebrew children we talk about trials and tribulations that we have in our life and we think man this is so insurmountable what was insurmountable was is that they were looking at a furnace that was heated seven times hotter than it was supposed to be so have you ever been to a campfire and put something in like a burn barrel or something that thing starts glow you know not to touch that they heat it so hot the people that were taking them in died but you know what it did to them it didn't kill them what it does brother Brown said it loosed them from what they their bonds it just burnt their bonds off same way with you and I tribulation we go through we say all this is the end my kids are gone my wife's this my husband my family my church maybe if you'll keep walking toward the fire keep walking toward the fire baby you're bounds what you bound with is gonna be loosed you know what they didn't even smell like smoke that's how much God protected them but watch this brother Ryan says sometimes in our own life that Paradox repeats sometimes you're brought to a showdown where you have to make a decision I've been preaching on making a decision because you got to make a decision whether you won't go up to statutory man or not where you have to make a decision you have to stand on that decision like they did they stood up one day and said hey that's all right you worship whoever you want to we're not worshiping that image which was the image of who oh well and then a prophet think about that for a minute they said but we're not bowing down to that image if we die we die if we live we live we're going ahead we're heading toward the furnace oh no I don't want that for you got to go through fiery trials to burn off the bands that you got wrapped around your head or your arms or your feet and listen even when Lazarus was raised from the dead he was still bound remember Jesus said loosen and let him go we need to lose it we've had a resurrection in our soul we've had a resurrection but what about our loosening to let us go so that we can go up the statue of perfect man and we could be a living moving instrumentality of God everybody with me you have to stand on that decision and I'm going to tell you something folks God is going to make you make a decision you've heard me say it many times before he's not going to let you be wishy washy all the time he'll put up with you every once in a while but somewhere or someday you're gonna have to stand and say I'll take it or I won't take it right I have decided to follow Jesus like they did and it all worked together for the good what did he do it never hurt him it loosed them and I like what brother Brown said in that rest of that quote he's talking about the man that was drowning in the water he said you got to get the man out of the water first before he can get the water out of the man amen hey man you gotta get the man out of the water preach repeat repentance get them out of the water and then get the water out of the man in other words get them out of the world and then get the world out of them amen by what preaching the word of God not stomping shouting Thorn them throwing them across the aisles no the word of God defeats more demons than anything in the world Jesus Christ look these son of man if we're going to be that character I believe in prayer lines I believe in laying on hands you know what but Jesus never had to do that he didn't have to he did he did because of them he wanted to do it the Gentile way oh you just say the word and it'll happen got called a dog one of those Gentile women did and she said but dogs eat from the master's table so us Gentile dogs have assembled today to eat for the crumbs from the master's table amen amen but we have been transformed by the renewing of our mind what into the Bride of Jesus Christ that what we sit at the table all the time now amen but we got to get to a place brother Brown said look committed to him the greatest weapon I know of a Christian today is what committal to God Camille to God give me time that's right when you can't do nothing about it just commit it to him and what God will take care of it amen greatest battle ever fought I believe it's the greatest battle it's ever fought is look 1962. he said it's now ready to go into action you think man that's going to action since 1947 back in spursion and all no he said right here it took a prophet to tell us now the battle is fixing the rage and it's going to rage Satan against the bride listen the devil the devil care about them people out there he's not got the bride defeated and even in the bride you know somebody said many times ago many years ago they said oh the bride really looks bad or looks awful it looks bad for the never has right you're looking at the mixed multitude you're looking at the ones that's hanging around for the fishes in the loaves you're not looking at the true bride because the true bride will always always stand forward always be the best and always take what God Said Amen always and I believe it's the greatest Bible Ever Fall is now ready to go into action now so that's the prophet he told us now it's ready to go into action what when the seals open that opened up the mind of God but remember it also open up the mind of the devil too because he's got to Incarnate a beast down here at the end time and he don't know how to do that until God incarnates me and you because remember he's a copycat he's not an originator he don't know how that's why he's watching you that's why he came to church he got here for you dude some of you brought him with you I believe that God has been selecting his soldiers that's us I believe he's been dressing them training them for 60 years since the prophet left training them in the Battlefront is now set getting ready to start where in the mind of the individual when this great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to raise now look that battle began where in the human mind we know that because that's why he preached the greatest battle ever fought everybody with me all right and that Battleground began in the human mind it didn't begin in the heart because you were dead and lost if Satan was in your soul amen so that's not that's the choice you got to make to drive that unclean Spirit down and let God come in Seal you in as a unit everybody with me okay chief he said now in me after he gets born again listen I didn't have a fight when I wasn't born again did you know am I talking to the same people I didn't fight I did what I wanted to do said what I wanted to say drink what I wanted to drink go where I wanted to go why it's all black but oh when the Holy Ghost comes here burns out that black Satan knows he can't get it's like that hot furnace say you're trying to grab your shoulder he's like oh but you got a spirit realm I can get into that Spirit realm and I can play that's my playground that's why God took the heart now Satan's not in your what your heart your soul then the Battleground begins in what in your mind there is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of battle where it was beginning that is because the decisions are made from the mind the head brother Brown tells us in the church age book you have to suffer the rain remember sister Larissa this is not a cruise ship we're not on a cruise ship voyage Fantasy Island bring me a no I don't drink my ties what I was going to say that for bring me bring me something don't be laughing but this is a battleship your own it's a big difference on the cruise ship the cruise ship is fine on about are you going to kill somebody we're going to kill the devil I want him daddy you know what God's given us the ammunition he's given us an Army full of Believers that needs to put on that armor but you got to suffer a little bit remember five-star generals were not made in the mess hall five-star generals was made in the battlefield he made the right decision based on what based on his intelligence he made the right decision and then what he saved many lives he won the battle so therefore he gets five-star or whatever how many on his shoulder so it goes to what suffering to rain the reason for this is that character is never made without suffering characters of Victory not something you were born with even at the new birth well don't get quiet on me now it was a victory to get born again but now you got other battles to start with all right A Man Without character can't Reign because power what the Holy Ghost without character is satanic um but Power with character is fit to rule all right say bye with me brother Robert said why am I against organized relation religion now many times we've heard people preach on the Statue of perfect well actually we won't hear many people ever preach on the Statue of perfect man but a lot of them preach it with the pyramid turned upside down you've got to get all these virtues before you get to Holy Ghost yes there is a doctors that I've heard it before brother Dale has two and Aaron has two that you got to get all these virtues to get the Holy Ghost how you gonna get Holy Ghost virtue without the Holy Ghost amen amen that's the devil putting a thought in your mind but that Holy Spirit seals you in remember if you've got a little crack the devil's gonna stick his finger in it a little bit of crack in the building have you ever seen a building though you go see the building you see a little crack if there's nothing done about it what's going to happen in about five years crack's gonna be about this alone by five more years after that in other words you and your battle in your journey your armor is going to have a crack in it Satan's gonna stick his finger in it but remember folks look if what is purpose to the church that's me and you the life that was in Christ isn't reflecting in you don't you stand still until you haven't got until you've got haven't got patience virtue and all these things Temperance godliness and all these things are required it's a requirement amen that we preach on this it's a requirement that you come to these virtues then of course I I I'm not going to background much on this but you've heard the expression it's all in your head amen God's all in your head because remember when you see that it means it comes from your head it's imaginary made up psychosomatic while it indeed is from your head it implies that it was created by your mind not that it's from your brain we come on the internet must be right it means if something is all in your head you have imagined it and it's not real how many times have we had a thought that we formulated we've created we've colored it and it never come to pass God is not that way when he has such a man got involved in not seeing all the different ones and it was all in their head yeah yeah they formulated an idea that God was three they formulated that the father son Holy Ghost was a Doctrine and that there was a purgatory and that there was this and that and the other that was a formulation but you know what man didn't think of it all herself Satan had a what he had partied because why he can get in your mind he can run around in your mind and he can make you think these things that's what he did with Martin Luther Martin Luther was born again believer in his soul but what a paradox that it was in his soul never believed what he was preaching somebody say Amen because that couldn't there's no way a father said holy ghost doctor and originated from his soul if he was born again that's right it originated of a formulation of a spirit that he got on him come on somebody that's where all doctrines come from it's a spirit that gets on you good or bad so is it all in your head James 1 says be careful but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the seed driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord a double-minded man I'm reading the Bible it's unstable in some of his ways oh it says all y'all can read that it says all his ways oh that word double-minded actually means wavering uncertain doubting look divided in interest some of you say here today with thoughts in your mind and you're in you're somewhere else [Music] I'll have my hand up there's something Sometimes some people been preaching my mind went somewhere else Elvis had left the building but don't we though you formulate ideas especially either the excuse you make of well I'm not listening to him because I don't understand him I don't like him he's not wearing my favorite vest he's but if you bring those thoughts the Bible says in captivity to the word of God bring those thoughts that's what we're going to talk about next Sunday bring those thoughts listen cast down imagination listen uh brother Dale tells a story about this one brother was real honest with him back when he was preaching uh brother comes out up to brother Dale after the service and brother Dale said I want to tell you I what oh he said I'll he said I figured out how to fix my tractor while you were preaching right foreign Place y'all don't do that to me that hurt my feelings I want to think that everybody's getting it all getting everything [Music] at least he was honest he learned how to fix this but that was him that was his thoughts [Music] cast down imagination we're going to talk about that maybe next remember you you can't you can't help the birds that fly over your barn but take a double barrel shotgun and blow them in the head and they won't build a nest in your house I promise you that you can use a single barrel if you want to but the double barrel Works twice as good but brother Ram tells us even the right mental attitude the right mental attitude toward any promise of God now not the right mental attitude toward what you want no the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise you're right mental attitude toward God's Divine promise will bring any promise to pass now maybe you don't believe that you say well my faith is weak I wouldn't confess it see don't let the devil know it I always say I've got good faith I believe God with all my heart see don't testify nothing all the devil made me do it now I'm like brother Dale there's a lot of things you blame on the devil you did yourself he just might have encouraged you to do it and when you stepped out into his field guess always remember Church God's words are true I believe the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise of God would bring it to pass if you can look at look if you can look at it in the right way but remember here's my standard in life and I read this because this should be our standard in life because what brother John was preaching this morning the first thing I want to find out whether it's the will of God or not and what is his will as well as his word yeah it's like I told you about your brother the brother comes up to the pastor of a church several years ago and says says brother God has impressed me now bro Steve don't you try this God has impressed me to go to work on Sunday well he was right there out of the will of God to go to work Sunday to make this extra like double time that is this place he volunteered for it so I can give all the money to missions well this motive and objective was right sure sure but the will of God it was not so that stopped the whole plan right there if it's not the will of God whether whether you're motive and objective listen they are some hungry people overseas that he didn't feed I'm sure but about a year from that he didn't start he wasn't even going to church he backslid see he got out of the will of God first first name brother Brown said look find out whether it's the will of God or not then I know it's God's will the next things he moved on I know it's God's will the next thing he moves to watch see if my objective to it and my motive in doing it then if it's the will of God my objective is right my motive is right see if that brother would have said well I've got an opportunity to work double time on Saturday and I'll take that double time money and I'll pay it to Mission work that would have been fine God would have honored that all the way through but he went the first one he dropped out on the very first one all right because first is the will of God no I'm sorry let me back up native fish the will of God my objective is right my motive is right I have faith that it'll be done because first is the will of God and I have my motive is to glorify him and my motive is to my objective is to glorify him and my motive is to give him all the glory so there's no selfish motives about it if you have a selfish motive it won't work listen we're the most selfish people in the world we got selfies we got selfie sticks we take selfie pictures we have Instagram we have Twitter we got all these different things that you take a picture of yourself thank you yep first time I was ever exposed to that was several years ago when I went to Philippines all them folks has got them they're the little short things anyway and they got one of them things that just stands out I thought what it was like a fishing pole but on the end don't laugh at the end of it with the phone and they're holding that thing way out like this they're all going I said that's what that's for yeah yeah that's what it's for selfish motive if you have a selfish motive it will not work if your objective is to make money for yourself or something you'll never succeed brother John was talking about this morning and then try to do something outside of the will of the lord it's not the word to begin with okay listen to this is brother Brown look I go on record in other words this is thus saith the Lord I go on record I say this about the word of God being a seed if you can take the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise of God why are you harping on this brother wait because look our attitude our mental human attitude is to not do any of that mm-hmm the mind the rock crown okay just want to make sure if y'all switched over another one came in look you want human knowledge you want to have a temper hello Regina you know you wanted to have one it pleased you to have a temper when you were not in a willow when you were not born again I told you I could I didn't have to hit you with my my hand I hit you with this yeah I cuss you every name in the book make you feel about that tall well God didn't remold my mouth he put a new nature in now hopefully that same mouth is trying to get you to do the same thing to yours so he's not going to take the vessel and destroy it he's going to repurpose it amen he didn't cut your arm off if you draped beer he didn't cut your arm off and put you in your hand on there because this one had Michelob in it or whatever it was no what he transforms you by the renewing of your mind that you don't want stuff anymore but it didn't bother you to have a temper you sure didn't want to have patience and some of us have that problem already all right everybody with me and brother kindness out the door our Bible said hate your neighbor as you hate everybody else and I ain't talking about your physical neighbor in your house I'm talking about everybody we had hatred listen all those things the Bible tells us what we had in our nature defiled things we they were just nasty yeah oh I know I wasn't no your Halo may have been held up by horns but if you can get yourself in position to believe that that promise was to you if you can what get in position to believe that that promise was made to you what was the promise the promise is we're going to win this battle he's going to equip us how's he going to equip us I left that out but I've been reading it so many times you ought to know it he gave us Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists and you can press play if you want to that's fine but you're not going to get you're not gonna grow that statue of perfect man just by pressing play I promise you that you're gonna have to listen to it live man I know brother Jason believes in that it's live Ministry somebody look you in the face and say we all go on to health we don't do the right thing hey either Faith or doubt yeah right ain't no halfway we got to get down to the battle here which side are you on you know what they call somebody that's kind of wishy-washy they call them a traitor and you know what usually he ends up dead usually he ends up dead and a lot of times the people he was doing the training with get him because they think he might be doing this over here well guess what I promise you the devil is a traitor he may try to get you to do stuff under the auspice that it was God yeah yeah you're right because remember brother Brown said you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost on your spirit every day of your life Miracles preaching and dying go to hell that's how close it is so I was telling you the other day somebody came up to me and we were talking about something they said man when I read anointed ones at the end time he said that sermon scared me to death it should yeah they should it's so close that it would deceive us if God didn't put that little thing inside of us that we went to church and we listened to a five-fold Ministry and that fivefold Ministry taught you the word of God to drive that unclean Spirit out of you like I said before Jesus never screamed at one demon not one actually they screamed to him listen the Devils called him God and the religious world called him a devil right all your bills above and then those demons when he walked up to those demons those demons say what are you doing here they were looking in the spirit Realm they saw this all the fallen angels that it fell from glory and they said we recognize you what are you doing here you're the son of God Jesus said hold your peace just leave can we just let's get out of the building folks I wish every devil in hell would do that now please leave this building we want God to be comfortable but we want the devil to be so uncomfortable until he leaves the building we want to be so uncomfortable in you until he leaves you according to his Divine as his divine power hath given unto us all things I can't believe people don't believe again I get born again there's nothing Divine but God there's no divine power in the devil that you weren't born with a divine power you were born with hatred malice gods and all those things the Bible said but according as his divine power hath given unto us us some things oh you want me to make it a little bit bigger it says oh things that pertain unto life and godliness to the knowledge of him that's called us the glory of virtue whereby are giving unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature from the get-go because he's going to say it besides this but that's what besides getting bored again add these things to you yes giving all diligence what is diligence haste earnestness uh well I I think I'll try I think I'll try to do it I don't know that furnace looks really hot you know what you're bound number one your mind is bound you're professing and confessing something that you shouldn't listen that's the imagination of your mind to say that God can't do to you what he done to others that's binding you you're binding you who's your worst enemy the devil mouth you're your worst enemy right absolutely hey so besides this giving all Earnest giving all giving all diligence add why we need that we already got it I think that word add means to add to add to your faith now it's your faith it's not God's faith anymore it's your faith because you've what you've molded or melded with the faith of God vulcanize the prophet said and now add to that Faith virtue our Chasse virtue face because you don't lose Faith all the way up that pyramid you got to have faith that you'll have the faith of God the virtue of God the knowledge of God the temples of God and I believe when I look this up it really impressed me because you looked that word ad you say oh it's just plus and read what the Greek meaning of that is to minister until there's no way you might be able again like I said to press play and get born again but you'll never press play and continue that way and add these virtues to your life you can't do it you got to have a live Ministry to deal with life problems with live issues and the things that go on in our life from Sunday to Wednesday till Sunday to Wednesday till Sunday to Wednesday till we get out of here so ad means to minister nourishment Minister unto so you got to have a minister amen all right listen to this a person of virtue makes the progression from knowing what is right to doing what is right you get born again you're a babe in Christ all right you're going to fall you're going to cry babies cry right babies cry all right we cry out by father tells us in the Book of Romans that's because we were newborn babes right Desiring the sincere milk of the word but what Paul tell us what grow up there's meat I had a glass of milk this morning with my egg it was good but I don't want glass of milk for lunch and a glass of milk for supper we do believe in supper around here dinner's in the middle of the day suppers at night I just want to make sure that's clear on that because it was the Lord's Supper not the Lord's dinner that was in the evening the Bible tells us all right but you learn everything when you come here something you shouldn't some you shouldn't but look it's going from knowing what's right to doing what's right so now we gotta do this yes we gotta do this we know what's right now we got to do it look he or she intentionally chooses what to say do in value reaching beyond the good toward the best look this is not self-help yeah this is the Bible all right you can read self-help books that's okay but the Bible is where you're going to get your nourishment from The Prophet's message is where you're going to get your nourishment from reach beyond the good toward the best in every situation a virtuous person knows that they have an opportunity to honor the Lord power without character it's satanic but Power with characters what fit to rule and reflect him to others it's not that we hold these virtues and we keep them in first thing you want to do is let it out first thing you want to do is somebody come up to you and say it's like I said before um well Steve I said if you have a headache or or a problem or an issue with your wife or or anything that goes on like that your kids you didn't get that did you do you go to the convenience store and ask that guy to pray for you why there's no facing brother to Mars brother different one hey I need some help will you pray for me why because there's virtue there yes right there's something you can pull from right get on the phone and call a brother a sister you don't call a convenience store operator or the guy you know he may be a good guy I don't say anything about it but still you don't want to pray for it because there's no virtue there there's no life because he said the beer and wine and cigarettes and all the other stuff so all right everybody with me all right so reflect him to others real quick I don't have to be real quick we ain't got to be there at four o'clock I'm preaching till three so I told y'all already I warned you pack your lunch listen how many times did Monica tell us not to be there early I'm just ain't doing what Monica said to do okay so if we leave here if we preschool three we leave at 3 3 15 we'll get that four we'll be fine I'm just kidding kinda but these virtues listen it's not just at virtues the first first ad these are all virtues everybody with me all right so that whole word of of that is moral Excellence value Merit meritiousness like we were just talking before specifically moral excellence not just be morally good there's a lot of people that are morally good sure a lot of people there's a lot of people outside me and you I don't know if you know them but I know a few of them okay but there's something inside though that makes us want to go a little bit further just a little bit further not that they're bad that's something they don't have maybe you got something you give them but like Daddy said before he said many many times he said maybe your kids don't want this message because you don't live it in front of them blame him don't blame me I'm just quoting brother down and that's what he said for years he's never backed off on it mine too I mean everybody all of us what look around we go home and talk about the preacher yeah I'm fixing to get into something right now you go home and talk about the preacher your kids hear that then they start making little snippy little comments cause you made them first or if you can't start talking about it or you answer your uncle's anybody you don't say hey shut your mouth we're working on he's still working on me and he's still working on you right no we don't do that you know what we do here I'm gonna put that log on that fire I'm gonna put that bigger log on that one I won't see it burn no no folks I need to sweep out her own door first I'm talking about all of us I got something I got kids that don't don't come to church so and I didn't I did I tried to live the best I could and that's what you got to do you got to try to live the best you can around them but do they hear you talking about the preacher they hear you talking about the Deacon they hear you talking about this you hear you say well brother Brian really didn't mean that he brother well we're not going to listen to that tape anymore because he hello somebody he's still working on me real quick these virtues affect your senses think about it the thoughts you have when brother Branham said virtue first thing pops in your mind a virgin life he said that's not it wow what do you mean brother that's not no that's not it it's not what he's talking about he's done by strength right okay uh well you got to have the knowledge uh oh we've got knowledge we've got DD's llds and Double D's and all these other uh college education no brother Ryan said that's not what I'm talking about he said it's knowledge to know whether the Bible's right or wrong you see what it means so there's a paradox there's something going on that we all believe this over here as the virtues and brother Brown says no that's not what that means it means it's over here yeah yeah change a renewing of your mind because your mind goes over here we got to take our mind and put it back over here put it in the word of God knowing that it is knowledge but it's Heavenly knowledge all right Heavenly thoughts yes yeah sitting in Heavenly places I'm trying to understand God I say trying because we all try we're trying to understand God all right so it does affect your senses but it starts in that heart or the soul of you and that's just faith and doubt that's it there's no in between you're either a born again believer today or you're lost I'm sorry I didn't write the book he did right and you might be justified and Sanctified that's okay but until you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're not born again you're not a Christian right you're trying absolutely a lot of us are in that are in that place but you got to come to where you got to put that state down and say God you you know me you and him the only two that know each other real well well the devil does too but say God I'm done I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired this stinking thinking has got he's got me over here on this side nothing's going right that's why I pray when I pray for my kids and I pray for your kids I say Lord stir their water don't let them sleep until they find you just what Josh told us one time but we were praying for him and and and thank God he's back in church and that's great been a while but we were he just comes up and he's just having a goofy time he acts like me now he's not my wife it's goofy time he's out of the goofy time he's running hitting people he was you know speeding and he was getting put in jail and poor old mom and dad had to go get him one time and that's all he's back there now he's yes is right he comes up to us one day and he says would y'all stop praying then I was there would y'all stop praying to me you said what do you mean he said I know y'all praying for me to do right he said I'm out here trying to do all this and y'all praying for me to do right in my whole life being messed up he said what yeah it's not working make them so uncomfortable God make them so uncomfortable so miserable with this life that they want this life I told y'all many times before the holy ghost or not but you know what I wanted I wanted what that man had right there be my natural daddy or my spiritual Daddy I wonder what that man had because I knew there was a fair mom too there was a lie I wanted that Lifeboat see I didn't call it a holy ghost you can call it whatever you want to I wanted that life why because it was virtue it was something that what was in there and it came out I didn't look at the mistakes they made sorry Mom I the hardships of Life yeah hey look at that I looked at the what will of God purpose and what they were going to try to do right brother Dale wore his he wore his body out all ministers wear their body out why because they're giving so much trying to what get your sorry self in I'm one of them sorry sales okay I'm sorry yeah why I'm sorry South sin right yeah but where's him at look at brother random he was 56 years old when he died he looked like he was about 70. yeah if you look at it if somebody's got a picture of it somewhere you can see his hands just a picture of his hands when he was doing a wedding his hands were all crinkled up looked be about 80 years old why because what he was doing he was doing it for me and you why he was letting the virtue in knowledge there's no way you can't say brother random what a manifest the Son of God then all these virtues were working through well that was just for the profit and he left no I don't think so no that's for me and you amen everybody all right we can't go just a little bit further not everybody said amen at least you're not sleeping look do not yet understand that whatsoever entereth into the mouth and goes out to belly is cast out in the drought praise God it ain't got nothing to do with the diet right brother that's right but those things right which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart that's what defiles a man for out of the heart perceive is what evil thoughts murders adulteries fornication theft false witness blasphemies and I'll quote you where um Paul said in Corinthians I said he said and such were some of you but you're washed but you're sanctified I like that word bud every once in a while but you're washed these are the things which defile them that's hands to file is not a man remember the I said oh he's eating food without washing his hands well I'm a chief of centers because I don't I'm not a good hand washer sorry I eat with my Fork not my hands watch this right here though but watch what watch what Paul said in the Book of Romans Romans 6 verse 16. know you not that to whom you yield yourself servant to obey his servants you are to whom you obey lean this way lean this way all right whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness so let's do two choices all right by the abundance of the heart soul but God be thanked that you were the sir you were the Servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered to you according to Ephesians 4. prophets pastors teachers evangelists being then made free from sin you became the Servants of righteousness Paul a prisoner of Christ can you say you're a prisoner of Christ no I've got this I'm in this prison house and I mean be a prisoner of Christ one time I speak after the manner of man because of the affirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your member servants to uncleanness and to iniquity and iniquity unto iniquity even so now look yield your members what brother Brown tell you now here's a great prophet the greatest Prophet that ever lived before besides Jesus Christ the greatest Prophet we listen I mean edge of our seat brother Branham what I do if I'm stingy what'd he say no let me tell you in that good Kentucky English he said do the vice versa you know what that means do the opposite no now we need to pass and he said if you're stingy start giving money away some of y'all preached Indy all right but now look look that's what Paul's saying look even so now yield your members service to righteousness just ill listen we yield to the devil enough Amen to God and that word heart means cardia all right that's where we get the word Cardiology from it denotes the center of all physical and spiritual life the center and Seed of spiritual life the soul or mind as it is the Fountain and Seed of the thoughts passions desires appetites affections purposes Endeavors of the understanding The Faculty the seat of the intelligence that's why you don't you don't think you don't with your brain your brain's a processor it processes what comes out of here everybody with me yeah right as a man thinks in his heart not in his mind all right the faculty and see the intelligence or the will and character of the Soul so far as it is affected and Stern in a bad way are good or of the soul that is as the seed of the sensibilities the affections emotions desires appetites and passions it's the middle and center of you Matthew 12 34 says for out of the abundance of the what heart the mouth speaketh all right a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringing forth good things that evil man have evil Treasures bring forth evil things then brother Brown real quick let me let me run through these I want to read because I want to read you something you know those five senses are what memory reasoning conscious affection imagination that's five out here now look see tastes Phil smelling here is to contact the world with they can be absolutely fooled absolutely so see they spell smelling here it's not something you need to depend on go deeper memory you know that's our problem you've heard me say it many times before our problem is in that second realm because what we remember what we reason our consciousness our imagination yeah what's what's your old saying don't let your imagination get the best of you happens a lot and then the last one is affection we know that's not agape love that's paleo love that's the love you have down here brother Brown said agape love is from heaven and if you're born again you have agape love in your soul so your Soul's in heaven I've already told you many times before I believe your soul is in another dimension now Not Over Yonder is still here but it's working in another dimension because look this ain't so to it this is falling this is something your soul should never touch if it's born again because evil and good can't live together you can't mold them together to our memory reason conscious affection and Imagination is what's killing us and brother Adam tells us right here God of this evil waves 1965. and as I've said many times before folks this is going to really stun some of you that are that are here for the first time your body flesh does not sin think about it it's on a v only a vehicle because what's motivating inside just like I said before you say you prove that Jesus told him one day because in the Old Testament the Pharisees could stand and say I've never touched that woman I've never committed adultery never touched her but Jesus went a little bit further he said if you just think about it so it wasn't the flesh part it was the thought part so let's don't say what my flesh made me do it no your flesh is something to hold on all right hold your guts together in your real heart and all that other stuff it's a capsule that holds you together but you what out of the heart perceives everything all right so don't blame the lies My Flesh maybe no Jesus said the flesh is weak but the spirit's willing but he's vice versa for the disciples because they fell asleep so the five inner senses five outer senses five inner senses are memory reasons conscious facts and Imagination I told you one time before I wanna but I want to read this again your memory your memory is what you remember and you can't erase that I I hope to God this that you know there's a lot of things that we did when we were younger that we remember but there's a lot of things we did that we don't remember I mean you vaguely remember something you know that happened well as time goes on time what time heals all wounds time the bad stuff because remember the Bible says the former things will be passed away what in your mind God's gonna wipe your hard drive but he's going to leave the good things he's a good god he's going to leave the good at the time you had a wonderful time in a service the time you got born again the time you married your wife come on somebody the time you kids came to the Altar and gave their heart to God the time you came to the altar you're going to remember those things but the heartaches and tribes and the things that we lord Jesus the things we set up and and all night long we worry about stuff can't do a thing about them and when we get over there you ain't even gonna remember they happen so why worry about them now but what we're about to worry warts right we worry about everything but that's just a human part but with what we got to yield our members over here to where there's positive not to the negative all right one more thing and then we'll close memory reasoning what we reason things out it's a decision or or we think a logical sensible way you know when they were when they were at nicaea they didn't come in and go I think could have get the people to believe this this Doctrine no they went in believing that was the doctrine that Jesus said right now the devil was inside going I'll get him I'll get them but the outside man they were trying they were trying but they what they yielded themselves to the devil and not to God all right everybody okay with that ain't God knew that wink at their ignorance but now now today okay you can't be ignorant book's been open there's nothing hid nothing so that gives us power to take the word of God like it's supposed to not take a false Doctrine these people kill you over a false Doctrine when it's actually killing them all right memories and conscious we talk about conscience that's just the conscious part of you that's when you go to sleep at night you have them crazy silly dreams that you don't know where they came from yeah okay just wanted to make sure I wasn't the only okay it's just State that's just the humanity part that's just a firing mechanism in your brain that's putting all these things together all right imagination is the act or power of forming a mental image of something not present to the senses or never will be that's exactly what it is imagination is what you imagine something not present to the senses or never will be never will come to reality we need to get rid of that one I don't like that one at all but let me tell you this right here and then we'll close musicians come on Aaron I'll read you this real quick brother Brown said in Christ the mystery or Christ revealed in his own word they said they don't have this I just pulled it up a few minutes ago you can't love with your body you love with your spirit your body only what projects it all right everybody with me all right because remember the Pharisee is in their heart they wanted to do what they couldn't do to that girl yeah because he's afraid they'll get caught or or and they were under the Bible in the Old Testament as long as you didn't touch them you were fine but Jesus said no you sit there and formulate these things in your mind that you want to do with them you're just as guilty all right let me read this real quick now this is about affection but I thought it timely if we have a wedding coming up this is a timely read right here we'll stop that we'll continue with that a little bit later on listen to this let's go and stand our feet in time-tested memorials was talking about men losing their affections for their wife and don't love them as they did when they were sweethearts shame on you wait a minute everybody believed brother Brown was a prophet everybody hold their hand up you don't you didn't believe it okay all right thank you thank you all right you ought to do it she's always your sweetheart absolutely that's the part she should be and you should treat her like that oh never let that little honeymoon cease hmm yeah because it isn't going to in heaven don't let that honeymoon cease because it isn't going to in heaven praise God it's going to be just perfectly one there looks like some women ought to said Amen to that don't it he said you never hear you always hear me about balling out women says sister Hickerson why don't you say something Mr Hickerson why didn't you say something or somebody oh thank you sister Cox that's very good brother cops that's for you I'm just reading quote and we should never forget to honor each other always be sweethearts never let it sneeze Kathy boy came to me not long ago his wife was separated he said Billy I hate to come to you I'm Catholic and you're a Protestant said but a priest run me out of my house or I'm out of his house a minute ago and I said what's the matter with him he said well he told me he says I drink a little all right he said of a night I worked hard and said my wife thinks I ought to come in every night and kiss her and hug her and make it out I'm telling you what brother Brown said and make out just like we were fixing to get married [Music] see you must always remember I said she's 40 years old now at that time and she really needs your attention hmm so they had a divorce court and I'm not doing this is kind of funny I don't know what to do I said go call her if I go out there as a Protestant she won't listen to me he said oh she likes you and I said you go call her and tell her that you've changed your mind and so the next day I called the judge and talked to him so brother Brown went and talked to the judge for him and I told the boy I said I'll be sitting right down beneath the floor where the judge is going to give you a raking over I'll be praying for you don't tell her about it all right he said so I was down there praying after a while I heard some little clicking coming down the steps and here they come arms around one another just smiling I said well hello there he said brother Branham it's been some time since I seen you in parentheses he said yeah just about 30 minutes ago sometimes since I see you and she said well Reverend Branham I haven't seen you in a long time glad to see you again I said thank you why you look like your sweethearts I said we're just doing fine aren't we honey she said yes we are there she said I have to say it sometime Reverend I said thank you very much say goodbye to him went by the old boy turned around and waved back like this they were all happy now listen that's right look love conquers everything even feel your love even feel your love conquers everything agape love conquers it all but look what he's saying that's right conquers everything just love you can have all your signs and evidences but just give me love he said that'll settle it for me Just Give Me Love that's right wonderful right around I hadn't seen you in a long time he said I saw him 30 minutes ago it's kind of funny he let him tell a little fib and he didn't take him to the Altar and smack him upside down why it was the cover-up that he'd been talking to Brother by Adam because his wife would go you've been talking to him how some women are you've been talking to him yeah well we have to talk to people every once in a while but I thought brother Brown he said look Love Will Conquer everything and I'm telling you when we get to when we get to that love right there that's not love that that a normal person has that's not filial love that's agape love and that's the epitome that's the love that Jesus had when he went to the cross and said not my will but thy will be done when he went and said I'm not going to save myself I'm going to save you that's the ultimate sacrifice but you know what we could do the same thing and and still die and go to hell but he had the Holy Ghost inside of him and he said that Lord I'm going to come back and I'm going to give it to them see I can't get my I can get my life for brother Aaron but I can't put my soul in him he probably wouldn't want him but so in him but the love of God the agape love that he had when he was on the cross that was the part that you are now and he was able to come back into a believer and that's why we believe in the New Birth here more than anything you if you're not born again you're lost you might be heading in the right direction that's fine but until you get sealed in Satan is right there with his grubby hands and he's going to claw you and do everything he can to get you but you know what greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world let's sing a song God bless you and I will not leave remember we don't need to get over there at four o'clock we need to get over there if you get over a little bit earlier I mean at 3 30. but that's okay but just don't go in the facility because there's not a lot of room but let's just eat about here and then leisurely take our drive over there so God bless you we love you with the love of the Lord thank you all of you to cut for coming today and I'm pressing on the upward way new Hearts I'm gay every day still praying [Music] Lord plant my feet on higher ground Lord lift me up and let me stand by faith on hand the table land a higher Point Let's Get just a little bit higher a little bit more and a little bit more [Music] doubts and fears dismay the summit dwell what is above my prayer my name is Lord lift me up and let me stand by faithfulness table lamp a higher plane left my feet on higher ground [Music] I believe we can I believe we're able to do that but still I pray tell Heaven I found Lord lead me all too high

church maybe we should but when we get ready to leave on a trip we stop put that car right there in the driveway and park and we pray before we leave and when we pull in the driveway what's the first thing we say Jim thank you Lord sister Brady told us that years ago when we go to Jamaica all those many times we'll go over there and boy you sure enough you're on the road about that wide and the cars were about that wide and sister Brady should we get out it'd be two o'clock in the morning we'd get out and she'd say thank you Lord and she meant it listen if God didn't protect us Satan had loved to kill us he'd love to take us out he does not like us he hates us he hates us because there's something he can't get to he can pick all he wants to but he cannot get into your soul if you're born again let's sing a song as we dismissed Lord bless you we love you with lover Lord we'll see you over there if you're going uh but we're going to eat something downstairs before we go so we'll be
