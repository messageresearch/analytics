[3:49] on this
[3:50] lord jesus we thank you
[3:52] we love you
[3:54] we desire one thing lord and that's for
[3:56] you
[3:57] to have the preeminence in all of our
[3:59] hearts and our lives
[4:00] for us to be what you want us to be
[4:03] for us lord to
[4:05] just commit ourselves to you
[4:08] and to just walk up right in your love
[4:09] and grace
[4:11] we love you and we thank you we ask you
[4:13] to be with each one of these be with the
[4:14] sick among us
[4:16] and just touch each one you promised us
[4:18] so we believe it bless brother gary our
[4:21] lord as he'll be going through all of
[4:23] the things getting ready for the
[4:24] operation
[4:26] friday and just blessing god to take
[4:28] care of it we still believe that you can
[4:31] take care of everything and he don't
[4:32] even have to be operated on
[4:34] because we don't worry about it we know
[4:36] who the healer is
[4:38] irregardless of which way you want it to
[4:40] be done
[4:41] we ask you now to guide and bless in the
[4:43] service open the eyes of our hearts as
[4:45] we sing
[4:47] unto you lord that we may see
[4:50] you living among us
[4:53] in jesus name amen
[4:57] hebrews 11 1-2 then we'll go to verse 8.
[5:01] now faith is the substance of things
[5:03] hoped for the evidence of things not
[5:05] seen
[5:06] for by it the elders obtained a good
[5:09] report
[5:10] all right now what are we doing taking
[5:12] the reports that they gave
[5:14] verse eight
[5:16] by faith abraham when he was called to
[5:18] go out into a place which you should
[5:20] actually receive for an inheritance
[5:23] obeyed and he went out not knowing
[5:25] whether he went
[5:26] by faith he sojourned in the land of
[5:28] promise as in a strange country
[5:31] dwelling in the tabernacles of isaac and
[5:34] jacob the heirs of with him of the same
[5:37] promise
[5:38] for he looked for a city which hath
[5:40] foundation whose builder and maker is
[5:44] god you may be seated the lord add his
[5:46] blessing
[5:48] to the reading of the word
[5:50] now we covered
[5:51] in doing you know sunday
[5:54] about
[5:55] we were talking about
[5:57] abraham's journey
[6:00] and uh trying to pick up the things you
[6:02] know
[6:03] in all of that and tonight we want to
[6:05] talk about our journey
[6:08] the bringing it down more because what
[6:10] have we been dealing with
[6:13] we've been talking ever since we started
[6:15] on this
[6:16] series 22 messages ago
[6:19] were talking about a positive attitude
[6:22] and that anybody in the bible had ever
[6:24] amounted to anybody anything had a
[6:26] positive attitude
[6:28] and they had a contact with the god of
[6:31] that word
[6:32] you know they they had personal
[6:35] personal experience
[6:37] and i've kept on asking you and i the
[6:39] question
[6:40] have we had a personal experience
[6:44] and and not to just talk about somebody
[6:46] else's experience but to talk about our
[6:49] own experiences
[6:50] in in in god
[6:53] and and doing that then because it's
[6:56] personal to you and i
[6:58] and uh remember there's only one
[7:00] uh
[7:02] moses
[7:04] there was only one noah
[7:06] there was only one enoch
[7:08] you know
[7:09] and they had their part that they
[7:11] fulfilled in their lives and they're
[7:13] doing you know so you know and realize
[7:16] that my point is what if
[7:19] what if it is for us or to you
[7:22] for god to give you something
[7:24] that's personal to you
[7:26] now he even said it like this one time
[7:28] talking about a preacher he said god
[7:30] could train you 40 years
[7:33] to give you a 30-minute sermon
[7:36] well i'm just hoping sometime somewhere
[7:38] out of this 40 something years that i've
[7:40] been preaching that i've got at least a
[7:42] 15-minute sermon out of it anyway you
[7:45] know and got to to go on with the lord
[7:48] and uh you know to understand but
[7:52] you know
[7:54] paul speaks of
[7:57] abraham as we were talking about sunday
[7:59] as being the father of us all
[8:04] so we covered that he was the father of
[8:06] the jews
[8:07] he was the father of what would be known
[8:09] as the arabs or whatever you want to
[8:12] call them the gentiles
[8:14] and things and knowing that we're that
[8:17] abraham himself was
[8:19] was not a jew because that word jew
[8:21] didn't come along until later on in the
[8:23] scripture you know over into jude before
[8:25] it ever appears in esther all right and
[8:29] uh
[8:30] in that then abraham
[8:33] had a journey
[8:35] that if you and i will look at it
[8:37] we'd understand why brother branham
[8:39] would say
[8:40] on who is this melchizedek progress
[8:43] 64-66 said every son of the faith
[8:47] will absolutely do the same thing
[8:52] every son of the faith
[8:54] will take the same journey
[8:56] that abraham took
[8:59] abraham's journey was laid out there in
[9:01] the scripture remember and they lived it
[9:04] for
[9:04] an example
[9:07] you and i and they they didn't really
[9:09] know
[9:10] uh what they were doing you know in
[9:12] doing that uh josh uh we i
[9:16] viewed one of her message the other day
[9:18] and boost us up a little
[9:20] because you all have to correct that
[9:22] between the two of yous
[9:23] but we had to very well run the volume
[9:26] out to be able to do and some here say
[9:29] is that you know that when i get down
[9:31] and slow and going down they don't hear
[9:33] me real well so pull it up you know
[9:36] until
[9:37] where that it don't kill the eardrums or
[9:39] the ones that can hear good but also
[9:41] allow the ones that you know can't hear
[9:44] for them to be able to hear
[9:46] of what we're doing and and it'll keep
[9:48] it in that line all right
[9:50] now
[9:52] so if ever son of the faith
[9:55] we claim to be the seed of abraham by
[9:57] faith
[9:58] we claim to be the children of god
[10:01] all right that's fine but where are the
[10:03] children of abraham by faith
[10:07] by revelation
[10:09] for god to reveal himself to us
[10:13] and showing us who we are
[10:15] all right
[10:16] now then we don't have to worry about it
[10:20] see we we used to think well we're here
[10:23] we believe god's using us we believe you
[10:25] know this that or the other but we
[10:28] really don't know
[10:29] exactly what we're here for or maybe we
[10:32] don't you know follow it and don't look
[10:34] at it like that well
[10:36] then
[10:37] why not go back into the bible and
[10:40] that's what i've been trying to do
[10:43] is to get us to take the ones in the
[10:45] scriptures
[10:47] who went through things
[10:48] for
[10:49] our examples
[10:52] all right
[10:53] then we can follow that and see
[10:56] what is coming next
[10:58] all right so then we can go through
[11:01] the things in the life of abraham
[11:05] and and i'll just skip some of it
[11:06] because wade done a good job on what he
[11:09] was bringing but i just want to hit a
[11:11] little bit
[11:12] because looking at his life it's exactly
[11:16] showing
[11:17] what we are
[11:18] and where we are right now
[11:21] and what the next thing is
[11:23] all right
[11:25] the next thing is the change of the body
[11:28] see and abraham went through those
[11:30] things
[11:32] all right
[11:34] in his journey
[11:36] but
[11:36] now remember
[11:38] of the story
[11:40] his name is not abraham to start with
[11:44] it's abram
[11:46] all right
[11:48] now the covenant
[11:50] the promise
[11:51] now listen very carefully
[11:55] it was not made with abraham
[12:00] that's a way over in his journey
[12:02] the covenant the promises and all was
[12:05] made with abram
[12:09] see we want to take and pull up a little
[12:11] bit slide away from off of this way
[12:13] don't know how to undo him but we got
[12:14] abraham we're we're the seat of abraham
[12:18] we just remember
[12:20] what the journey he went through
[12:22] is the same journey we're going to go
[12:24] through
[12:25] if we're the seed of abraham if the
[12:28] prophet's right
[12:29] and we believe it
[12:31] that he said every son of the faith
[12:33] would go through the same journey
[12:37] that abraham did
[12:39] all right
[12:40] now see we want to get on to the silly
[12:42] parts and
[12:43] and the things but it does fit in but we
[12:46] don't want to go out and give our wife
[12:48] away and do this out of the other
[12:50] it's what i say we're uh that's what i
[12:52] talk about sunday we become too educated
[12:55] you know us educated idiots uh we like
[12:58] to show how smart we are
[13:01] when we're really showing how dumb we
[13:03] are
[13:04] all right but think about it now
[13:08] abram
[13:09] you know that the covenant was made with
[13:11] abram
[13:12] do you know that that comes over to a
[13:14] way into the journey before his name is
[13:17] changed to abraham
[13:22] well see then we're dealing with abram
[13:27] all right
[13:28] and in that he meets god many times
[13:33] in his journey
[13:36] and those things in the way he meets god
[13:39] we by way of the prophet we take those
[13:42] things and relate them to our journey
[13:49] we say
[13:51] genesis 12
[13:54] abram come through justification
[13:59] we say
[14:00] genesis 15
[14:03] abram comes through sanctification
[14:05] because of the things that are happening
[14:07] there
[14:08] and in genesis 17
[14:10] he finally receives the baptism of the
[14:12] holy ghost and he's still abram
[14:19] see we're trying to make it some split
[14:21] condition
[14:22] to try to get away from these things but
[14:24] my point is
[14:26] is that
[14:28] in my journey as a christian
[14:32] i remember meeting god
[14:40] well brother dale i've never met god
[14:44] are you born again
[14:47] well you met him somewhere
[14:50] okay
[14:54] it's time to wake up
[14:56] and start thinking about really where
[14:58] we're standing and what we've done
[15:00] and where we're at you know in doing
[15:04] in our life and our journey
[15:07] what do you think happened to you
[15:09] at justification
[15:11] or where you first repented
[15:16] oh if i was like abram if i was like
[15:18] abraham and god had talked to me
[15:23] who called you to repent
[15:32] who called you to clean up your life
[15:39] who called you to
[15:41] a new birth
[15:45] but yet we don't believe
[15:47] that god is speaking to us like he's
[15:49] speaking to these people that we can
[15:51] read of and we say if we were only like
[15:54] that
[16:00] look back through your life
[16:03] that's the thing i'm trying to get us to
[16:05] do
[16:07] look back through your christian journey
[16:12] that when you first repented
[16:17] and when you first asked god to forgive
[16:19] your sins
[16:22] the bible said the goodness of god
[16:26] calleth thee to repentance
[16:30] all right
[16:31] now you didn't do something good
[16:34] to get him to call you
[16:38] abraham was a gentile abram was
[16:41] he was a gentile from the the land there
[16:45] what it chaldees
[16:47] the era of chinese all right
[16:50] and he was
[16:53] he was a gentile
[16:58] he was just an ordinary person
[17:02] he wasn't a super-duper
[17:04] uh thing he was just an ordinary person
[17:10] and god came down and spoke to it
[17:13] and like i've said to you many times
[17:16] see we want to make it a
[17:18] predestinated and and oh we got to get
[17:21] everything involved in it
[17:23] but
[17:25] i wonder how many
[17:26] people talked that god talked to
[17:29] even in the days of abram
[17:35] we went through that he talked with cain
[17:37] as well as abel
[17:43] but see we we got it all we think we've
[17:45] got it all figured out
[17:47] we got into the message and again get
[17:49] begin to get a little uh intellectualism
[17:53] into our thinking
[17:55] and we think we've got it all figured
[17:56] out
[18:01] but abram was a gentile
[18:06] lord spoke to him and said
[18:08] get out of this country
[18:10] go to a land
[18:12] i'm not going to tell you where it's at
[18:14] you just journey
[18:17] and when i decide to let you know about
[18:19] it i'll let you know
[18:21] right
[18:22] so he starts on a journey
[18:26] and immediately that was right at the
[18:28] beginning of genesis 12.
[18:30] immediately about the seventh verse of
[18:32] 12th chapter
[18:34] the lord appears to
[18:39] brother tell you mean do you think that
[18:42] that
[18:44] god would appear to us at
[18:47] justification
[18:49] well what do you think happened
[18:53] i'm serious
[18:57] but we don't look at it that way
[19:01] we think we repented
[19:03] we think we tried to clean ourselves up
[19:08] and don't think that god was making
[19:10] contact with us
[19:14] and talking to us
[19:16] but god don't talk to nobody but the
[19:18] prophets
[19:19] where's that in the bible
[19:21] where is it brother brown's message
[19:23] well i don't want it then
[19:26] all right
[19:28] but you see church
[19:30] we're not taking it as for what it is
[19:37] god
[19:40] called you
[19:42] to repentance
[19:46] all right
[19:48] we can read about it in abraham
[19:50] of how that but all of it in abraham was
[19:53] it it doesn't really show a great big
[19:55] amount of things except one thing
[19:58] abraham gets up
[20:01] and he starts walking
[20:05] you know it's not even recorded that
[20:07] abraham cried
[20:11] and went through a whole lot of things
[20:13] at his justification
[20:21] but yet if we don't have some form of
[20:24] emotionalism parts to us
[20:27] we don't want to credit that as being
[20:29] authentic
[20:33] well you're right in the middle of the
[20:34] devil's trout do you
[20:36] that's the best way to say it
[20:38] you order by now at least begin to
[20:40] realize
[20:41] that you can't depend upon
[20:44] anything but god's word
[20:47] and god's word said
[20:50] that
[20:52] he spoke to abram
[20:54] get up
[20:56] leave and go
[20:59] all right
[21:01] he starts on his travel on his journey
[21:05] he meets him in chapter 12
[21:08] verse 7.
[21:10] it was good enough for him to call him
[21:11] and tell him to come out
[21:13] but it's the bible art said the lord
[21:15] appeared unto
[21:17] abram
[21:21] and remember he's just a repentant
[21:23] sinner as we'd type it today
[21:26] and we would top it to our journey
[21:31] you don't remember
[21:34] god talking to you
[21:39] you know speaking to
[21:42] you no we think all of that is us
[21:47] all right
[21:49] but look
[21:51] we get on over in the 13th chapter
[21:54] and it says the lord spake
[21:56] abraham
[21:59] he's still this abram
[22:02] 14th chapter he hasn't even come to
[22:04] sanctification yet
[22:06] and he meets melchizedek
[22:12] come on i wasn't the one that told the
[22:14] story i wasn't the one that wrote the
[22:16] book
[22:17] so don't get upset with me about it
[22:19] think about what's being said do you
[22:21] understand what i mean by that wrote
[22:23] around and said ever seed of the faith
[22:26] would take the same journey
[22:33] that abraham took
[22:36] all right
[22:39] so when are we going to settle down with
[22:40] that and say okay let me read what
[22:42] happened to him
[22:46] you don't remember when you first
[22:47] repented see i was 18 years old so that
[22:50] puts me more in a category
[22:53] wife and i were married
[22:55] you know and that puts me in a category
[22:57] of more of a remembrance i guess than
[23:00] maybe you in your younger years of
[23:03] 10 12 years old or something when you
[23:06] repented you know in the things in your
[23:08] your first repentance but you can
[23:10] remember when you repented don't you
[23:12] you remember something happened to you
[23:14] don't you
[23:16] you remember a change come in your life
[23:18] don't you
[23:19] well what caused that
[23:25] well i just decided to be better
[23:28] no
[23:32] god come down
[23:34] and begin to contact you
[23:38] at justification
[23:43] moving on into sanctification
[23:47] the
[23:47] 15th chapter
[23:49] but he's done met him if you're
[23:50] listening to what i'm talking about
[23:52] genesis 12 it's the lord spoke to him
[23:55] 12 7 the lord appeared unto him
[24:00] 13 14 the lord spake to abram
[24:03] 14th chapter of genesis in 18
[24:06] he met melchizedek
[24:09] the king of salem
[24:16] and he ain't even got the sanctification
[24:18] yet
[24:21] all right
[24:24] 15th chapter
[24:27] where we talk about him being
[24:28] sanctification
[24:32] meets the lord
[24:35] the covenant is made
[24:37] in the 15th chapter of the animals and
[24:40] the thing remember he's still abram
[24:46] right
[24:47] he's still abram he's not changed
[24:48] abraham
[24:50] all right
[24:52] he's still abram
[24:53] but yet he's done met god about four
[24:55] times
[25:02] but yet can you talk about your
[25:04] experience
[25:05] of where you started as a christian and
[25:08] what god has been doing with you
[25:10] and how he led you through these things
[25:17] you don't remember that you joined a
[25:20] church
[25:22] but yet after a while you just wasn't
[25:23] satisfied at that so you maybe moved to
[25:26] another church
[25:34] some of us like me
[25:36] wound up being deacons
[25:41] just sanctification
[25:46] being
[25:47] sunday school teachers
[25:49] training union directors
[25:54] is sanctification
[26:04] you see if you ever get that down you'll
[26:05] understand why brother dale can be like
[26:08] he is
[26:09] if you just realize your own journey
[26:15] mr hazelfanboy has played the piano for
[26:17] 17 years
[26:19] about i don't know exactly how many
[26:20] years of that
[26:25] and she was still smoking
[26:31] i ain't let no woman smoking be a
[26:34] okay
[26:37] it's not your church
[26:39] okay so don't worry about it just call
[26:42] me an unbeliever
[26:44] do what you want to
[26:51] because you see i remember where i came
[26:53] from
[26:57] that's the hardest thing in the message
[26:58] ain't it because people boy they well
[27:00] bless god
[27:01] i've seen that
[27:03] first time it was said i've seen it and
[27:06] i'm sorry i got too good of a members of
[27:08] remembrance some of you it took me six
[27:11] months to a year to get you to see one
[27:12] god you done got baptized and
[27:23] but you see church we don't think about
[27:25] the contact that god has made with us
[27:30] do you mean he would actually
[27:32] contact a man back there
[27:36] that is not coming to the basis of
[27:39] redemption
[27:41] in being the the uh
[27:44] becoming a family of god or the children
[27:46] of god
[27:48] and he'd be more personal to him than he
[27:50] would to you
[27:54] see church it's time to get rid of
[27:56] churchiology
[27:59] well i'm in the message what else do you
[28:00] want
[28:02] you know
[28:04] but you see
[28:06] abram
[28:08] comes to meet god
[28:11] in chapter 15.
[28:16] and it's on over
[28:19] later
[28:22] the 17th chapter that the prophet covers
[28:24] it that that that would be the
[28:27] baptism of the holy ghost
[28:34] what about it
[28:40] seemingly
[28:44] that he appeared to abram
[28:46] more in the beginning of his journey
[28:50] as to even meeting melchizedek
[28:53] and fed him to caif into different
[28:55] things
[29:00] and then
[29:01] later on his contacts don't seem to be
[29:04] as strong with him
[29:06] in personal things
[29:09] but we just go to church we're all right
[29:12] brother dale i just i just one day i
[29:15] just i just said lord forgive me and i
[29:17] just walked in church and i've been
[29:18] there ever since and and you know i
[29:20] really don't know when i got saved
[29:23] well then you're not saved
[29:25] that's the best way to say it
[29:29] i had a definite experience
[29:32] of justification
[29:34] i didn't know that was what it was what
[29:36] about you
[29:38] i had a definite experience
[29:42] at sanctification
[29:45] i didn't know that was what it was
[29:49] but what about you
[29:51] can you talk about can you preach your
[29:54] your experience from the bible
[30:02] if you can't then maybe you haven't had
[30:04] the experience
[30:07] but see a lot of times we've had
[30:08] experiences but we didn't know that was
[30:11] what it was
[30:16] right
[30:18] we didn't know that was
[30:20] god dealing with us
[30:26] that said go to this church stay there a
[30:28] little while leave that go to this
[30:29] church go in here go in there searching
[30:32] talking to people
[30:36] but we don't count that as god
[30:40] dealing with us
[30:46] so then if we're going to do as the
[30:47] prophet said
[30:48] abraham in his journey was a type of the
[30:51] pure pure believer
[30:54] then we go to justification
[30:56] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[30:59] ghost
[31:06] i said i had a definite experience of a
[31:08] time of justification
[31:10] i had a definite experience of a time of
[31:13] a cleansing within my life
[31:16] and a definite experience for the
[31:17] baptism in the holy ghost
[31:19] not to just say i believe the message
[31:22] not even because i've seen angels not
[31:24] even because i've seen the lord
[31:26] in a church when i was 12 years old i
[31:27] never put none of that there
[31:31] but how many of you have ever had an
[31:32] experience of justification
[31:38] have you ever repented of your sins and
[31:39] felt a great big load go off of you
[31:45] no i just went to church
[31:47] well you need to get an altar
[31:52] have you ever had a time when something
[31:55] began to deal with you and say you're
[31:56] not supposed to be living like that
[32:02] you know
[32:03] if you're going to be a christian you
[32:05] are not be living that way
[32:10] but what are you going to call that
[32:15] so you can be going through the journey
[32:17] and actually having experiences but then
[32:20] not knowing what it is and not being
[32:22] taught because they never taught us
[32:24] those ways
[32:26] and we don't really know what was going
[32:27] on
[32:32] then when i talk about the baptism of
[32:34] the holy ghost as being the person
[32:38] the prophet says of jesus christ coming
[32:41] and living in you
[32:43] well now brother dale lattice
[32:46] i don't know about that i'm just
[32:49] i'm just i just do the best i can
[32:51] i just
[33:03] but you see if you haven't come through
[33:04] that you don't have the new birth
[33:14] abram gets a name change
[33:19] right
[33:22] type in a new birth bringing it right in
[33:24] relating in 17 and 18 both of them
[33:26] together
[33:29] you know that brother random said when
[33:30] you become a christian
[33:32] you get a name change you remember that
[33:36] he said
[33:37] what you used to be was sinner said now
[33:39] you're a christian
[33:45] but you don't count that as a part of
[33:46] your journey
[33:53] and here we come to the message of the
[33:54] hour
[33:59] and we're in the message of the hour but
[34:01] yet we don't count that as an experience
[34:06] and i didn't say coming in the message
[34:07] an hour was the experience of the holy
[34:09] ghost as a new birth because i never
[34:11] taught it that away
[34:15] but it's an experience
[34:18] it's part of my journey
[34:20] i love to hear
[34:21] you tell your journey
[34:29] no matter what you call how simple it is
[34:35] are unimportant
[34:39] i like to hear your testimony about how
[34:42] god has directed you
[34:47] you know there might be a lot of things
[34:49] in our lives that could be
[34:50] major things
[34:54] that we didn't even think about it being
[34:56] it
[34:59] we thought it was just a happening
[35:03] you know
[35:05] the person you marry the the church you
[35:07] go to the
[35:09] the things of life
[35:12] that can all be connected into your
[35:15] experience
[35:24] i'm talking about our journey now we
[35:26] talked about abraham's journey sunday
[35:30] in the two of the things in relation
[35:35] and i want it to be personal to me and
[35:37] you tonight
[35:42] you know to think about
[35:45] what we have went through
[35:50] to come to where we are now
[35:54] right
[35:56] honestly now think of it
[36:03] look what you gave up to come into this
[36:05] message
[36:10] positions things in other churches
[36:17] the right to just be any way you want to
[36:19] and live like the devil and still go to
[36:20] heaven when you die because that's what
[36:23] they taught you
[36:30] and yet you come into a message that
[36:33] is
[36:34] hard on the human flesh
[36:39] because the flesh is having to be
[36:41] brought under subjection
[36:43] that was never taught to us by
[36:46] other churches irregardless
[36:50] you know the best they could do they
[36:52] never taught anything in the
[36:54] relationship
[36:56] of coming to a change of the body
[36:59] because everybody come along with the
[37:00] idea we're going to get a new one what
[37:01] do you need to change for it you're
[37:02] going to get a new one
[37:04] right
[37:06] right well worry about this whole body
[37:11] smoke him cigarettes because this body
[37:12] here is not going it's gonna die it's
[37:14] gonna go to the ground
[37:20] can you put your journey in the bible
[37:26] and you relate yourself to anyone in the
[37:29] scriptures
[37:30] and the best thing to start off is a
[37:32] doubt in thomas
[37:34] right it's the best place to start
[37:40] but that's where we all started
[37:44] in a journey
[37:46] a journey
[37:49] to
[37:51] bring us to be the children of god
[38:00] what about the things that happened
[38:02] in this journey
[38:06] could you say you met god
[38:12] come on i'm serious i'm
[38:15] can you go back in your life and think
[38:17] about
[38:18] where you came from and what you've done
[38:28] and how you lived and what was going on
[38:36] well why can't we
[38:38] do that
[38:44] he wasn't concerned with god when you
[38:46] were little
[38:48] i was
[38:50] very concerned but
[38:52] don't even count that as salvation
[38:54] though
[38:55] after i found out what it was
[38:58] but you know what that's part of my
[38:59] journey
[39:02] and i'm glad to tell you my journey
[39:06] but yet people thinks that you think
[39:07] you're exalted or some kind of a prophet
[39:10] or something because you can say that
[39:12] you saw god when you was about 10 11
[39:14] years old standing in a church
[39:26] what about it
[39:29] didn't something leads you
[39:32] something call you
[39:34] to repentance
[39:36] call you to a clean life
[39:42] and didn't it call you to the end time
[39:45] message
[39:49] or is it because your wife's in the
[39:50] message your husband's in the messenger
[39:52] or anytime something or whatever daddy
[39:54] mama was
[39:57] when you do it that way you won't last
[39:59] long
[40:02] but when you get something personal
[40:06] i'm talking about our journey
[40:11] and before abram gets over to
[40:15] a lot of things has happened in the
[40:17] man's life that he was in contact
[40:19] personal
[40:20] contact
[40:24] with almighty god
[40:34] we can see truly if we go back in
[40:36] genesis 15 through 17.
[40:40] and see as i said the covenant was made
[40:44] with abram
[40:47] that's why paul comes along later maybe
[40:49] you don't follow him when he says when
[40:51] was it made it was made when abraham was
[40:54] in circumcision or before circumcision
[40:58] he said the covenant with covenant was
[41:00] made before circumcision
[41:08] circumcision is an outward manifestation
[41:11] of the fact that something has taken
[41:13] place
[41:18] but what do you think
[41:22] have you ever really repented
[41:27] you know just ask god to forgive you
[41:31] and really mean it from the bottom of
[41:32] your heart
[41:39] and really labor in the basis of
[41:42] trying to
[41:45] do the best we can living
[41:53] it's not a hard thing to do
[41:58] you know
[42:01] yeah but if i become a christian i just
[42:03] have to give up too much
[42:06] no
[42:06] what are you giving up
[42:10] giving up the world
[42:12] which is killing you
[42:15] destroying you
[42:25] that's where i was going to go on and
[42:28] into sarah and her journey we're gonna
[42:31] maybe be a little surprised when we get
[42:33] into the next one
[42:34] because we want to beat on sarah real
[42:36] hard
[42:38] but you know what there was a time come
[42:41] so you come to the right place
[42:45] that's what i'm trying to get me and you
[42:46] too
[42:56] the abram got a name change
[42:59] and made him abraham
[43:05] he appears to him
[43:08] talks with him
[43:10] tells him throughout that journey
[43:12] you're going to have a child
[43:16] abram he misunderstands because he
[43:18] doesn't get it right he said the
[43:20] disciple might walk before you
[43:26] and even after
[43:28] he gets a change of the body
[43:31] you know he's made young again i want to
[43:33] separate that in a second
[43:37] even after his body is made young again
[43:40] he turns around gives his wife away the
[43:42] second time
[43:46] why
[43:48] because he wasn't a born-again believer
[43:54] right
[43:56] he was scared to death
[44:05] he gives his wife away twice you
[44:07] remember back over in the
[44:08] in about the 12th chapter somewhere in
[44:10] there
[44:13] sarah was 65 years old i remember
[44:16] calculating that up one time
[44:18] getting it down to see and she's 65
[44:19] years old and that's when the first time
[44:22] that abraham was going to give her away
[44:25] she must have been a beautiful woman
[44:29] because she was already 65.
[44:33] well they just lived longer back there
[44:34] days is the same 24 hours you know still
[44:37] the same
[44:44] but yet it comes over later
[44:48] and he's turned back to a young man
[44:54] and he's still scared to death about his
[44:56] neck and his own doing
[44:59] do we get sarah to lie to the king
[45:02] that's my sister
[45:04] and well
[45:06] it wasn't technically alive so that
[45:08] makes it the worst
[45:10] technically that was his sister
[45:13] but that's the worst lie
[45:17] right
[45:19] a little bitty live worse than great
[45:20] bigger all right
[45:22] but think about it now
[45:29] abram
[45:31] finally
[45:33] through what god does and that's why
[45:36] he put him to sleep he took him out of
[45:38] the way he made all of the covenant
[45:40] everything abraham didn't have anything
[45:42] to do with it
[45:44] he's totally asleep
[45:47] all he's got to do is wake up and start
[45:49] walking
[45:52] well i wonder how many times god spoke
[45:54] to you and i
[45:56] in our journey but we didn't understand
[45:58] it
[46:03] i walked out of that baptist church
[46:07] because i knew i had to leave there was
[46:08] no choice it wouldn't that they didn't
[46:10] run me off
[46:12] and i walked out i went home that night
[46:15] and i got in my old barbecue pit out in
[46:17] the back of the house
[46:20] and said when the lord
[46:22] i really have messed everything up now
[46:26] because there's just no way back
[46:30] and i'm sorry that i've messed it up
[46:32] so now you're gonna have to come make
[46:34] something out of what's here
[46:36] because there's no way for me to go back
[46:38] there's nothing else i can't do
[46:40] because i believe you
[46:44] i believe you spoke to me
[46:48] and you call me
[46:52] you believe that god spoke to you
[46:56] and called you to repentance
[47:00] see then getting something personal
[47:04] a positive attitude about your
[47:05] experience
[47:09] trying to relate it to you as uh some
[47:11] things we can talk about
[47:14] that happened in your life
[47:21] and see i don't even count as i told you
[47:24] i don't count the fact that i saw an
[47:26] angel or i saw the lord when i was 10 11
[47:28] years old i don't count that to new
[47:29] birth
[47:32] you say well boy that would be a great
[47:34] thing for me to talk about i don't count
[47:36] it that way because i know how i lived
[47:39] after then
[47:42] and i know when he stopped me the second
[47:44] time
[47:48] when i was 18 years old
[47:54] i know i had that contact with him
[47:58] what does he look like that's what
[47:59] everybody wants to know
[48:12] but how many of you have ever had an
[48:13] experience
[48:15] that you can talk about
[48:20] not because you quit drinking and
[48:21] smoking running around with women
[48:23] remember that's under sanctification
[48:26] justification is just chopping off your
[48:28] past sins
[48:30] and dealing with that
[48:33] sanctification starts dealing with the
[48:36] unclean spirit going out
[48:42] well i didn't know that had to be that
[48:44] way i just thought i just believed it
[48:46] and got it
[48:47] no
[48:48] that don't exactly work
[48:53] abraham didn't do that he had
[48:55] experiences
[48:56] he met god
[48:58] over and over throughout his experience
[49:02] do you realize what i mean by when he
[49:03] gets over the earth
[49:04] and meets melchizedek in the 14th
[49:07] chapter
[49:10] he meets melchizedek and brother brown
[49:12] said that was almighty god
[49:21] and he's still not born again
[49:28] you see we want to count our experiences
[49:30] in our life to make them our born-again
[49:32] experience well see i would be
[49:35] justified in saying that i seen god i'd
[49:37] be just if i didn't say it i've seen an
[49:39] angel three times in my home
[49:41] but i count none of that to do with my
[49:43] salvation
[49:48] maybe god let that happen to me
[49:51] where i can talk to you about it
[49:55] to keep you from building it on some
[49:57] form of fanaticism
[50:03] you know
[50:06] i'd rather have just a slow
[50:09] day by day walk
[50:11] in my christian journey
[50:14] that i just keep moving on
[50:16] and i keep climbing higher and higher
[50:19] i'd rather have that
[50:21] than all
[50:22] the great experiences that you can speak
[50:25] of
[50:28] because satan can impersonate
[50:30] every one of your experiences
[50:34] but he can't walk day by day in the word
[50:39] so i'd rather have the word being
[50:41] revealed to me
[50:45] and in finding out that we're talking
[50:46] about faith being a substance the
[50:48] substance is a revelation
[50:54] and that's why i keep asking you
[50:56] has god revealed anything to you
[51:01] something that nobody can't take away
[51:03] from you
[51:07] something that can't be explained away
[51:13] something personal to you
[51:22] you can go through a lot of things like
[51:23] wade did and you get an abraham and
[51:25] savior and the name changes
[51:27] excuse me and all kind of things
[51:31] but my main point is for you and i
[51:34] to
[51:37] check in abraham's life
[51:39] of how many times god came down
[51:41] and met with the man
[51:45] in his journey
[51:52] how many times has he guided you and
[51:54] directed you
[52:02] some of you that are from overseas in
[52:04] different countries
[52:06] you know
[52:09] and poor old sister milka
[52:12] her mama and daddy sent her over here to
[52:15] get her away from the message
[52:18] right
[52:19] that's the reason
[52:21] he's laughing probably on the internet
[52:23] now about it
[52:26] they sent her over here to a
[52:27] missionary's home to get her away from
[52:30] the message
[52:32] and she gets a job and a lady she's
[52:34] working inside of as a believer in the
[52:36] message
[52:39] invites her to go to church
[52:44] right
[52:46] well yet all the way over here i've
[52:48] lived and talked with her about it and
[52:49] she agrees i said all the way over here
[52:51] you just crying lord i've been trying to
[52:54] follow the truth i was following the
[52:56] word and now you let my family just pick
[52:59] me up and dumped me to where i don't
[53:00] even have a family i don't have nothing
[53:04] and all the time he's just leading her
[53:05] right into the word
[53:10] she asked this lady
[53:12] and the lady says yeah but same lady
[53:15] says there's another church too
[53:17] if you'd like to go
[53:20] so she comes up here
[53:21] and you know what she's been here ever
[53:23] since
[53:29] what about it sister trudy
[53:33] we say black trudy white trudy i hope
[53:35] everybody on the internet don't get that
[53:36] messed up in their mind that's the only
[53:38] way we can keep up with trudy macmillan
[53:40] and trudy
[53:42] you know
[53:43] but what about it trudy cassandra what
[53:45] about it
[53:46] where'd you come from
[53:48] how did you get over here
[53:56] somebody introduces her to the message
[54:00] right
[54:02] how do we get where we're at
[54:05] oh brother anderson he was out there in
[54:06] california doing great
[54:11] and just gets a contact
[54:19] why can't we think about our journey of
[54:21] life and think about it in a wonderful
[54:23] way and realize what god has been doing
[54:28] to bring us to where we are right now
[54:36] and thinking about how greater could he
[54:38] have done
[54:48] and bringing us down to the end time
[54:54] to were
[54:56] that abraham done one more thing
[55:00] now
[55:02] we've got to get our story correct so i
[55:04] want you to follow me for a second
[55:08] abraham and sarah were turned back young
[55:12] we use the word change brother random
[55:15] uses the word changed
[55:17] that's all right but they were really
[55:19] not changed
[55:22] they were reversed from being old
[55:29] right
[55:30] the process of them aging
[55:33] reversed
[55:34] and they wound up back a young man and a
[55:37] young woman
[55:42] because they never got the change that
[55:44] you and i are going to get
[55:46] but they spoke of it
[55:49] because they never got the new birth
[55:52] that they spoke of but we got it
[55:56] right
[56:01] and see then it comes down to where
[56:03] we're at
[56:05] are we just wanting to be young again
[56:12] or do we want what god wants
[56:15] what about it
[56:16] i just want to read these couples about
[56:18] three quotes
[56:20] to think on this point
[56:23] go ahead brother and start with getting
[56:25] in the spirit 1961
[56:27] 428
[56:32] you're on abraham's
[56:36] yep
[56:38] i got the other way because that that
[56:40] would be e49
[56:42] we're on over on number three
[56:44] come up to number three okay
[56:47] we get it right
[56:49] e15 getting in the spirit
[56:52] now watch
[56:54] he's talking about changing the moment
[56:55] the twink of an eye
[56:56] i want you to listen to his reading
[56:58] because we know this but i want you to
[57:00] listen to his reading and then make the
[57:02] point see what we're talking about
[57:04] all right
[57:05] and we'll have to have a changed body
[57:09] now sarah and abraham
[57:12] in that kind of a body
[57:16] turn back young now listen
[57:19] could not receive the promised son
[57:24] watch him now they were 100 years old
[57:27] couldn't receive it that way but when
[57:29] they're chained when they're pulled back
[57:30] to a young person they still can't do it
[57:38] there's a difference in being turned
[57:39] back to young and being changed
[57:43] but yet the word is interchangeable so
[57:45] do all right but now what abraham and
[57:47] sarah in that kind of a body old people
[57:50] could not receive the promised son they
[57:52] were 100 years old
[57:53] he had to change their body
[57:56] not turn them back so much as to young
[58:00] which he did but also changed them
[58:03] because they'd been like they was at
[58:06] they they'd been like they was at the
[58:10] first place
[58:11] you understand
[58:13] you understand what he's explaining
[58:16] if god turned them back to young man and
[58:18] a young woman
[58:21] they couldn't have children when they
[58:22] were a young man a young woman right
[58:25] they lived together all her life did not
[58:26] know children if he put them back young
[58:29] so we had to change them
[58:34] so we won't just want don't want to be
[58:36] young again we want to be changed right
[58:39] and he changed their body in such a way
[58:42] that they could receive the sun
[58:44] right
[58:46] so they couldn't get the sun up here
[58:48] right
[58:50] that they could receive the son and now
[58:52] we find
[58:54] the next thing in order for the church
[58:56] now
[58:57] is a changed body
[58:59] not us old people go back
[59:02] and be young so much
[59:04] but we will
[59:06] and we will be there young
[59:09] just as certain
[59:10] but we got to have a changed body in
[59:13] order to receive the sun
[59:17] because we're going to meet him
[59:19] in the air
[59:21] we're going to meet the sun in the earth
[59:24] right
[59:25] rapture will come a change in a moment
[59:27] the twinkling of an eye all right
[59:30] so now what's he explaining so he goes
[59:32] on again and abraham
[59:36] and his seat after him
[59:38] whatever number four
[59:44] he 95 so and look
[59:46] what if he just turned them back to a
[59:48] young man than a young woman like there
[59:50] was at the first place
[59:52] they couldn't have had the baby in
[59:55] they couldn't have had the baby anyhow
[59:58] because they lived together when they
[59:59] was young man and woman he had to change
[1:00:02] their body in a different way
[1:00:06] in order to receive
[1:00:08] get the son
[1:00:10] a different way
[1:00:11] than just being going back to being
[1:00:13] young right
[1:00:14] is that right
[1:00:16] their body had to be changed in another
[1:00:18] way
[1:00:19] they'd received the son
[1:00:21] and we cannot
[1:00:23] if we would go back to be young men and
[1:00:25] women we still can't meet the son
[1:00:29] because we're going to meet him in the
[1:00:31] air we've got to have a changed body to
[1:00:33] meet in the air
[1:00:35] the rapture
[1:00:37] art are you listening
[1:00:38] one more
[1:00:41] this is off the message true easter seal
[1:00:45] paragraph 143
[1:00:49] now watch
[1:00:52] as he said as it was in the days of
[1:00:54] sodom so shall it be
[1:00:57] in the coming
[1:00:59] of the son of man
[1:01:01] now you ought to see what the connection
[1:01:03] the son of man is going to have to
[1:01:04] change there ain't going to be no change
[1:01:06] if the son of man didn't come
[1:01:10] if this message is not right there's no
[1:01:12] change of the body
[1:01:16] right it's all related to whether the
[1:01:18] message is right or not
[1:01:20] all right we see that taking place right
[1:01:22] now what was the next thing to change
[1:01:25] the body
[1:01:26] now show that this we are looking for an
[1:01:29] expected son
[1:01:30] glory is that right we cannot meet him
[1:01:33] in these bodies
[1:01:36] if we are changed back to young men and
[1:01:38] women still we can't meet him
[1:01:41] because we have to meet him in the air
[1:01:48] all right now what's the point in a
[1:01:49] second now
[1:01:51] that's why it's it's the word caught up
[1:01:54] there had to be something done besides
[1:01:57] change us
[1:01:59] there has to be something done besides
[1:02:02] change us back to young men and women
[1:02:04] we've got to be changed and caught up in
[1:02:07] the air to meet him and the next thing
[1:02:09] coming is the rapture of the church and
[1:02:12] the change of the body
[1:02:14] of the sleeping saints to meet the lord
[1:02:16] jesus in the air
[1:02:18] now think about it
[1:02:20] that's why it says
[1:02:23] caught up
[1:02:25] it doesn't say rapture because it's not
[1:02:27] in there
[1:02:28] it's caught up
[1:02:31] and even though you and i could be made
[1:02:33] young
[1:02:37] we can't go to meet the lord in the air
[1:02:39] at that point
[1:02:44] if everybody in the world was made young
[1:02:46] right now
[1:02:47] we still couldn't meet him in the air
[1:02:51] why because abraham and sarah doesn't
[1:02:52] show that
[1:02:53] abraham and sarah couldn't have any
[1:02:55] children when they were young and
[1:02:56] married
[1:03:01] and when he got they got old and he
[1:03:02] turned them back to being young they
[1:03:04] couldn't have any children
[1:03:06] then the change come
[1:03:11] this message
[1:03:14] is to bring you and i to a change
[1:03:19] to meet the promised son
[1:03:22] we've got to meet him in the hour now
[1:03:24] let's go for the lice when i'll be
[1:03:25] through
[1:03:27] look what he said on for abraham and his
[1:03:29] seed after him
[1:03:31] paragraph e96 we read 95 while ago
[1:03:35] it's a very short one so look at it
[1:03:38] number six brother
[1:03:41] are we looking for the sun
[1:03:44] what kind of sun
[1:03:45] are we looking for
[1:03:52] what kind of a sun are we looking for
[1:03:55] the son of god rising with healings in
[1:03:59] his wings
[1:04:02] there's your body turned back young
[1:04:08] we're looking for
[1:04:10] we're going to meet the sun and the
[1:04:11] earth right
[1:04:12] he doesn't come here so we're not having
[1:04:14] to worry about looking at
[1:04:19] are we looking for the sun
[1:04:21] what kind of a sun are we looking for
[1:04:23] the son of god rising with healing in
[1:04:26] his wings hallelujah abraham and his
[1:04:28] seed after him do you understand
[1:04:32] you follow what i'm saying
[1:04:37] we
[1:04:38] are going to have to have
[1:04:42] be made young yeah
[1:04:45] but that wouldn't qualify us because
[1:04:47] we're going to meet the sun in the air
[1:04:50] it's the sun of righteousness that rises
[1:04:53] with healings in his wings
[1:04:55] and i thought that was to be
[1:04:58] in you and i
[1:05:03] i mean that's my understanding if i've
[1:05:04] missed it i'd like to know that the son
[1:05:07] of righteous riding with healing his
[1:05:08] wing was a healing campaign went out in
[1:05:10] the last days for the son of man
[1:05:14] i remember
[1:05:15] the son of man
[1:05:18] the son of man is related down to the
[1:05:20] change then
[1:05:22] all right
[1:05:24] see the son of man
[1:05:29] was the sign of the resurrection
[1:05:32] are you with me
[1:05:34] the son of man see that's why jesus was
[1:05:36] the son of man
[1:05:39] brother branham was a son of man that
[1:05:41] the son of man manifested himself
[1:05:43] through
[1:05:48] and that the son of man
[1:05:51] is the sign of the messiah
[1:05:55] but if random had the son of the messiah
[1:05:57] i mean sign of the messiah
[1:06:01] which was the discernments in the things
[1:06:05] but it went further than just
[1:06:07] discernment it went on to the raising of
[1:06:09] the dead
[1:06:12] right
[1:06:13] the son of righteousness
[1:06:15] uh
[1:06:16] malachi
[1:06:18] says
[1:06:20] will rise with healings in his wings
[1:06:24] the prophet says we can't meet that son
[1:06:27] we've got to be changed
[1:06:30] before we go there we said what kind of
[1:06:32] a sun are we looking for
[1:06:37] we're not leaving off the earth and then
[1:06:38] be changed
[1:06:40] we're going to be changed here
[1:06:43] not just made young
[1:06:49] you remember what i said a while ago see
[1:06:51] then abraham in his typing
[1:06:54] could go so far
[1:06:56] and you can speak but you've got to stop
[1:06:58] because abraham and sarah now listen to
[1:07:01] the wording they were made young
[1:07:04] but they were not changed
[1:07:06] as we must be
[1:07:10] they were made young right
[1:07:12] but they both wound up getting old and
[1:07:14] dying
[1:07:16] right
[1:07:18] but you see you're not when we come to
[1:07:20] that
[1:07:22] turn back
[1:07:24] then we're changed to go meet the lord
[1:07:26] in the air
[1:07:27] there ain't going to be no starting over
[1:07:29] again
[1:07:33] one says you changed in a moment of
[1:07:34] twinkling of an eye
[1:07:37] we're going to go meet the literal lord
[1:07:39] jesus in the sky
[1:07:42] right
[1:07:43] but if the sun of righteousness don't
[1:07:45] rise with healing in his wings
[1:07:48] and you and i
[1:07:51] because of the message the prophet has
[1:07:53] brought us
[1:07:56] we know right where we're standing
[1:08:01] there's not going to be another prophet
[1:08:02] with signs and wonders
[1:08:05] because there's no examples in the bible
[1:08:12] it's the change
[1:08:14] it's the son of righteousness to rise
[1:08:17] in you and i
[1:08:19] a great healing campaign
[1:08:22] right is that the way the prophet said
[1:08:23] son of righteousness right
[1:08:25] great healing campaign but he said this
[1:08:27] is a
[1:08:28] special healing in other words
[1:08:31] this is a change of the body
[1:08:33] not just made young
[1:08:35] can we go right back and do again what
[1:08:38] we used to do it would be even worse
[1:08:41] you think oh if i was just young what i
[1:08:43] could do if you was young you'd turn
[1:08:45] back young and lust and everything else
[1:08:50] abraham and sarah did
[1:08:54] he's not listed as much of sarah but
[1:08:56] abraham went over and married another
[1:08:58] woman had about seven kids fire
[1:09:01] sarah died pretty quick
[1:09:04] but listen folks
[1:09:06] our journey
[1:09:09] we look at abraham's journey
[1:09:13] we see abraham's journey is to just show
[1:09:16] us
[1:09:18] the journey we take
[1:09:23] that's what as far as an example to show
[1:09:26] us
[1:09:28] the rising of the sun
[1:09:31] go get that message down listen to it
[1:09:33] it's rising of the sun
[1:09:37] that son of righteousness is rising now
[1:09:40] with healings in his wings
[1:09:44] that's why i've always encouraged you
[1:09:46] about healing and things instead of
[1:09:48] being like all these other
[1:09:50] brothers seemingly well we don't we just
[1:09:52] don't have what they had we just don't
[1:09:54] have what was back there we just don't
[1:09:56] have one here
[1:10:00] and i know i always get in trouble
[1:10:02] because i explain it
[1:10:05] but you take the faith of the fathers
[1:10:07] you take peter in them and stand them
[1:10:09] here today
[1:10:11] under the situation we're under
[1:10:13] and let's see
[1:10:16] what would take place
[1:10:21] that's not justifying nothing that's a
[1:10:23] god's honest truth
[1:10:27] brother branham come back
[1:10:29] and start around the country in a
[1:10:31] healing campaign do you think
[1:10:34] there would be
[1:10:37] a lot of people that want to hear him
[1:10:42] no no
[1:10:46] because the day's gone
[1:10:48] it's finished
[1:10:51] we're in the cooling off the coasting
[1:10:54] but the greatest thing that could ever
[1:10:56] be
[1:10:57] is among us today
[1:11:01] they're getting you and i to a place
[1:11:03] that we can be changed
[1:11:07] this message is what's doing it
[1:11:12] what do you think i've been preaching on
[1:11:14] see has not it been the whole point to
[1:11:16] you to say
[1:11:19] have you had an experience
[1:11:21] of god dealing with you
[1:11:27] or you just got what somebody else had
[1:11:32] have you had an experience that you can
[1:11:34] stand on
[1:11:45] what would happen today if all of the
[1:11:46] ministry in this church was arrested
[1:11:49] some of you have a good excuse for not
[1:11:50] coming
[1:11:55] what if all the ministers in this church
[1:11:57] was arrested today
[1:12:00] what would you do
[1:12:11] i know what a man made a statement one
[1:12:13] time
[1:12:15] and you'd say he was stupid but you know
[1:12:17] what a man made a statement one time
[1:12:19] about all these things upon the earth
[1:12:20] coming upon us he said a good time to
[1:12:22] just go smoke a joint
[1:12:25] you remember that one
[1:12:29] he was as straight and honest as could
[1:12:31] be
[1:12:32] because he knew that was nothing else
[1:12:33] could happen he said just go smoke a
[1:12:35] joint
[1:12:42] because he knew there wouldn't be no
[1:12:43] hopes
[1:12:45] if you miss it there would be no hope or
[1:12:47] was it matter
[1:12:52] but you see church
[1:12:55] god has made a way for you and i
[1:12:58] he's given us the new birth
[1:13:02] he's given us the message of the hour
[1:13:04] he's come down personally among us and
[1:13:08] vindicated himself as to being true
[1:13:11] here in the little church at lula
[1:13:13] vindicated himself as to be in god
[1:13:23] can we put all of our life on that word
[1:13:25] that's
[1:13:30] enrolled where are we at we're at the
[1:13:33] change
[1:13:36] because the son of righteousness has
[1:13:38] already risen
[1:13:40] with healing in his wings
[1:13:44] so the next is going to meet him in the
[1:13:46] air
[1:13:49] and that don't have to that's just kind
[1:13:50] of like an automatic process you know
[1:13:54] because that's just the after effect
[1:13:57] that's why abraham and sarah never made
[1:13:59] it to that
[1:14:01] they made it to the turn back to young
[1:14:02] young man a young woman
[1:14:04] and then went off and died later
[1:14:07] we're not gonna die
[1:14:10] somebody's gonna catch it and not have
[1:14:11] to die
[1:14:17] can you look back there and see then the
[1:14:19] things in your life
[1:14:20] relates to those that was before us
[1:14:28] that actually we're seeing greater
[1:14:30] things than abraham saw
[1:14:35] what brother dale now i'm going to get
[1:14:37] this point quick
[1:14:39] but brother dale i've never met
[1:14:41] melchizedek
[1:14:47] remember that was a quote we started
[1:14:49] with
[1:14:50] that every son of the faith would do as
[1:14:52] abraham done
[1:14:54] abraham met melchizedek god
[1:14:59] came down to abraham
[1:15:07] i thought we believed that melchizedek
[1:15:11] was god
[1:15:13] in morphy
[1:15:19] yet you can say that it was a theophany
[1:15:24] and then you can say that theophany is
[1:15:26] the word
[1:15:29] but now you understand what the prophet
[1:15:31] is saying
[1:15:32] every son of the faith is going to meet
[1:15:34] the word
[1:15:36] we meet the word that is the son of
[1:15:38] righteousness why i said there at the
[1:15:40] last a moment ago the son of
[1:15:41] righteousness had already risen
[1:15:44] with healing in his wings we're past
[1:15:46] that part in the opening of the word
[1:15:51] we're at the basis of the change
[1:15:58] every
[1:15:59] son of the faith
[1:16:01] is going to meet the word
[1:16:03] gonna end it with that talk
[1:16:06] well abraham met melchizedek which was
[1:16:10] the word made flesh
[1:16:13] all right
[1:16:16] you and i
[1:16:17] are going to not just meet melchizedek
[1:16:21] we're going to be the word made flesh
[1:16:25] whether you
[1:16:26] think about it or not
[1:16:28] we are to be the word made flesh
[1:16:33] we are to be melchizedek
[1:16:36] in another form
[1:16:38] call the bride
[1:16:41] which is the word for the day and the
[1:16:43] hour that we're living
[1:16:47] you see why the prophet and what he said
[1:16:49] every son of the faith is going to meet
[1:16:50] the word
[1:16:53] every son of the faith is going to go
[1:16:54] through the journeys that abraham went
[1:16:56] but every son of the faith is going to
[1:16:58] meet the word
[1:17:03] isn't it odd that
[1:17:04] the best thing people says about us is
[1:17:07] all they want up at lula is word word
[1:17:09] word
[1:17:12] no
[1:17:14] you know i feel pretty good
[1:17:16] that makes me feel good that's all i can
[1:17:18] come up with
[1:17:21] that i just brag too much about the word
[1:17:25] you know
[1:17:26] and try to get to people to see who they
[1:17:28] are
[1:17:31] and where the word might flesh come on
[1:17:33] musicians
[1:17:35] where the word made flesh
[1:17:38] i thought we believe the word made flesh
[1:17:40] was the light of the age
[1:17:45] it's in your flesh
[1:17:50] right
[1:17:51] it's in your flesh
[1:17:55] see why brother branham could not be the
[1:17:57] son of man but the bride of jesus christ
[1:17:59] around the world can be
[1:18:02] the son of man
[1:18:04] the word made flesh
[1:18:08] how close could we be
[1:18:12] walking off the earth
[1:18:21] that's up to him
[1:18:24] and really i'm not much worried about it
[1:18:26] because i'm sure i'm enjoying the
[1:18:28] opening of the word while we're here
[1:18:31] you know
[1:18:33] and when it's all over with
[1:18:35] then we'll get to meet him what do we
[1:18:37] got
[1:18:40] think on these things
[1:18:42] our journey
[1:18:44] the same journey that abraham took
[1:18:48] but our journey takes us one step
[1:18:50] further
[1:18:51] than abraham went
[1:18:54] but abraham went to the grave
[1:18:58] when he got turned back to a young man
[1:18:59] the young woman he didn't make it
[1:19:01] see because that would end all the types
[1:19:03] there just couldn't be no other way
[1:19:09] but i remember there was a man
[1:19:12] before abraham
[1:19:16] it was not because god took him
[1:19:19] i remember there was a man named elijah
[1:19:23] that got in a chariot and just rode off
[1:19:25] the earth
[1:19:27] so the things are there in the bible
[1:19:30] to show what we're doing and what's
[1:19:32] going on
[1:19:33] go ahead brother that's trying to 279
[1:19:37] and our journey is the same as abraham
[1:19:40] take
[1:19:42] time to
[1:19:43] be
[1:19:53] anybody have a need
[1:20:08] make friends with god
[1:20:27] is
[1:20:34] our sister's memory is what she's
[1:20:37] after
[1:20:40] and we pray
[1:20:41] we give her this prayer claw to believe
[1:20:44] and to show that we agree with her
[1:20:47] that by your stripes she's healed
[1:20:49] and you'll bring that memory back
[1:20:52] of the good
[1:20:54] not the bad jesus
[1:20:56] we don't need the bad we all have all of
[1:20:58] that memory that we need but we need the
[1:21:00] good part
[1:21:02] the memory of you lord
[1:21:04] the member of you guiding us and keeping
[1:21:06] us and directing us saving us and
[1:21:08] leading us
[1:21:10] and we pray that you'd restore under our
[1:21:12] sister
[1:21:17] just take that and keep it with you now
[1:21:31] let
[1:21:33] him be thy god anybody else
[1:21:50] enjoy
[1:22:08] still trust in his word
[1:22:13] yes take
[1:22:15] time to be holy

[1:22:38] make friends with god's two
[1:22:42] children
[1:23:19] with
[1:23:21] jesus alone
[1:23:25] by
[1:23:26] looking for jesus
[1:23:31] like him
[1:23:44] and we pray
[1:23:45] that no matter what they're trying to do
[1:23:47] with all this drugs who've given it to
[1:23:48] her
[1:23:49] that you'll take away the effect that
[1:23:51] they're having upon her
[1:23:54] that she'll come out of this
[1:23:55] come back to herself and get to the
[1:23:58] doctor and get everything straightened
[1:23:59] up
[1:24:00] because we believe you
[1:24:02] and we thank you
[1:24:03] we know we can ask
[1:24:05] we believe that we can receive that you
[1:24:08] can even make the medicine revert wrong
[1:24:10] for what they're giving her and make it
