[1:52] continually
[1:53] be in my mouth
[2:03] i'll magnify the lord with me
[2:06] and let us exalt his name together
[2:12] [Music]
[2:16] they looked unto him and were
[2:18] enlightened
[2:19] and their faces were not a shame
[2:29] the angel of the lord encount brown
[2:33] about them that fear him and delivers
[2:35] them
[2:38] that the lord is good blessed is the man
[2:41] that trusts
[2:42] in him oh feel the lord ye his saints
[2:46] for there is no want to them that fear
[2:48] him
[2:50] young
[2:50] [Music]
[2:58] come eat hearken unto me i will
[3:02] teach you the fear of the lord
[3:06] that deserves life
[3:12] keep that tone from evil in that lip
[3:14] from speaking gal
[3:22] the eyes of the lord are upon the
[3:25] righteous and his ears are open unto
[3:27] their cries
[3:36] the righteous cry and the lord hears and
[3:39] delivereth them
[3:41] out of their troubles
[3:51] many are the affliction of the righteous
[3:53] but the lord delivereth them
[3:55] out of them all
[4:02] evil shall slay the wicked and they
[4:05] that hate the righteous shall be
[4:08] desolate
[4:09] the lord redeemeth the soul of his
[4:12] servants
[4:12] and none of them that trust in him shall
[4:16] be deathless
[4:18] god bless you maybe something
[4:26] um you you can you can pull it up yeah
[4:31] amen you know those are two of my
[4:32] favorite scriptures many are the
[4:34] affliction of the righteous but the lord
[4:36] delivereth
[4:37] him out of them all and the reason is is
[4:39] because the angel of the lord and
[4:41] campeth about those who
[4:42] fear him and deliver him
[4:45] always keep that fear in your heart not
[4:48] a fear like you're afraid
[4:50] but that respect that love for god
[4:54] if i could describe it as like standing
[4:56] at the ocean and seeing how great it is

[20:08] if you were out and a police officer was
[20:12] to stop you
[20:15] and you said i surrender with your hands
[20:18] down he might pull his gun
[20:22] because he don't know what you're going
[20:23] to do because you haven't surrendered
[20:25] completely
[20:26] and this is even worse
[20:30] because he don't know what you're doing
[20:31] with this hand back here
[20:34] i believe it says i surrender oh yes
[20:37] when you get both hands up that police
[20:40] officer is going to feel at ease he's
[20:42] going to say okay there's nothing he can
[20:43] do he has surrendered everything he has
[20:46] so we're going to sing that one more

[24:30] our brother samuel allowing us to to
[24:33] stand here before you
[24:34] uh we're just family and so i'm just
[24:37] going to relax and i'll just preach to
[24:39] you like you're my family
[24:40] and we'll just enter into worship
[24:43] together and
[24:44] see what god has to say but uh
[24:45] appreciate uh the wade opening up his
[24:47] yard to us we're uh
[24:49] we're uh staying in the camper there and
[24:51] so we're camping roughing it a little
[24:53] bit but we're uh
[24:54] uh we're um appreciate the hospitality
[24:57] and uh
[24:57] i won't take a lot of time because i
[24:59] know i don't have a lot of time and uh
[25:01] so
[25:01] uh we get to know one another between
[25:04] services so uh
[25:05] we'll just jump right into the word so
[25:07] if you would take take your bibles and
[25:08] turn with me to second corinthians
[25:10] chapter four
[25:11] and we're going to read the entire
[25:12] chapter but focusing from about eight on
[25:15] but i want to
[25:16] allow you to get the context of what
[25:17] we're speaking of here
[25:19] and so uh you can go ahead and turn
[25:21] there and we'll take a reading
[25:25] and uh you love the lord this morning
[25:27] amen
[25:28] amen i can feel this presence this
[25:30] morning and and wherever the presence of
[25:32] the lord is there's liberty
[25:35] so therefore seeing we have this
[25:37] ministry as we have received mercy we
[25:40] faint not but having renounced the
[25:43] hidden things of dishonesty one
[25:45] not walking in craftiness nor handling
[25:47] the word of god deceitfully but by
[25:49] manifestation of the truth
[25:51] commending ourselves to every man's
[25:53] conscious and conscience and the sight
[25:55] of god
[25:56] but if our gospel be hid it is hid to
[25:58] them that are lost
[25:59] in whom the god of this world hath
[26:01] blinded the minds of them which believe
[26:04] not lest the light of the glorious
[26:06] gospel of christ
[26:07] who is the image of god should shine
[26:09] unto them for we preach
[26:11] not ourselves but christ jesus the lord
[26:15] and ourselves your servants for jesus's
[26:18] sake
[26:19] for god who commanded the light to shine
[26:21] out of darkness has
[26:22] shined in our hearts to give the light
[26:25] of the knowledge of the glory of god and
[26:26] the face
[26:27] of jesus christ but we have this
[26:30] treasure
[26:31] in earthen vessels that the excellency
[26:34] of the power
[26:35] may be of god and not of us
[26:38] we are troubled on every side yet not
[26:40] distressed
[26:41] we are perplexed but not in despair
[26:44] persecuted
[26:45] but not forsaken cast down but not
[26:48] destroyed
[26:50] always bearing about in the body the
[26:52] dying of the lord jesus that the life
[26:54] also of jesus might be made manifest in
[26:57] our body
[26:58] for we which live are always delivered
[27:00] unto death for jesus sake
[27:02] that the life also of jesus might be
[27:04] made manifest
[27:05] in our mortal flesh is that what you'd
[27:07] like to see is for christ to be man
[27:09] manifest in this flesh so then then
[27:12] death worketh in us
[27:13] but life in you we having the same
[27:16] spirit of faith according as it is
[27:18] written
[27:18] i believed and therefore have i spoken
[27:22] we also believe and therefore speak
[27:25] knowing
[27:25] that he which raised up the lord jesus
[27:28] shall raise
[27:29] up us also by jesus and shall present
[27:32] us with you for all things are for your
[27:35] sakes that the abundant grace might
[27:37] through the thanksgiving of many
[27:38] red down to the glory of god for which
[27:41] cause we faint not
[27:42] but through our outward though our
[27:44] outward man perish yet the
[27:45] inward man is renewed day by day for our
[27:49] light affliction which is but for a
[27:50] moment worketh for us
[27:52] a far more exceeding and eternal weight
[27:55] of glory
[27:56] while we look not at the things which
[27:58] are not seen
[28:00] but at the things which are not things
[28:02] that are seen but other things are
[28:04] not seen for the things which are seen
[28:06] are temporal
[28:07] but the things which are not seen are
[28:09] eternal
[28:10] let's bow our heads father we just thank
[28:13] you for your word we thank you for
[28:14] uh lord just the the what you've told us
[28:18] just here
[28:18] and simply in scripture this morning
[28:20] lord uh
[28:22] what power what to what promise here and
[28:24] i as we look into it i pray god that you
[28:26] would anoint it to us and as we
[28:28] look into ministry and how it works i
[28:30] pray god that you would
[28:32] open our eyes to it even as we sung that
[28:34] song open our eyes that we might see
[28:36] jesus we want to
[28:38] see you in your word and we want to see
[28:40] you in each other
[28:41] and god we ask you to bless the service
[28:43] now in jesus name
[28:44] amen you can have your seats so this
[28:48] morning i'm going to be speaking on
[28:49] ministry paul
[28:50] spends a lot of time here in second
[28:51] corinthians and
[28:53] chapters three four and five and a
[28:54] little bit into six and and of course he
[28:56] spends a lot of time in timothy and some
[28:58] other epistles he spends time speaking
[29:00] about ministry so it must be an
[29:02] important thing
[29:03] and and i'd like to speak on ministry
[29:04] and unless any of you grab some
[29:06] pitchforks and start throwing it back
[29:08] because you're not ministers know this
[29:10] that
[29:10] every one of you has a ministry so when
[29:13] i'm speaking about ministry and i'm
[29:15] speaking about ministers know this
[29:17] you're all included and so uh when we
[29:19] look at this and second
[29:20] if we back up a chapter uh in second
[29:23] corinthians chapter three verse three it
[29:24] says
[29:25] for as much are you as you are
[29:27] manifestedly or
[29:29] or obviously declared to be the epistle
[29:32] of christ ministered by us you are the
[29:35] letter
[29:36] just like paul wrote letters to
[29:38] different churches he wrote epistles to
[29:40] the corinthians he wrote
[29:41] epistles to different ones you are the
[29:44] letter that christ
[29:45] wrote to the world amen you are the
[29:49] letter and so he says you you're
[29:51] declared to be the epistle of christ
[29:52] ministered
[29:53] by us written not with ink but with the
[29:56] spirit of the living god
[29:58] not in tablets of stone but in fleshly
[30:01] tables of the heart so god is writing
[30:04] his word on the tables of your heart
[30:06] that you might declare to this world
[30:08] his word that's part of your ministry
[30:11] and the pulpit ministry
[30:12] is is to uh enable the holy spirit to do
[30:16] that that we're part of that process but
[30:18] this
[30:18] this whole thing is a ministry working
[30:20] together to declare to this world
[30:23] the final voice to this final age this
[30:26] is what god is doing and so brother
[30:27] brahman says this in revelation chapter
[30:29] 4
[30:30] uh 1961 he says now everybody can't be a
[30:32] preacher
[30:33] but you've got a voice and if you can't
[30:35] preach the people a sermon
[30:37] if you're a preacher you're called to a
[30:38] pulpit to preach but if you're not
[30:40] you're still a preacher
[30:41] but live the people a sermon let your
[30:44] sermon be lived it's the voice of god
[30:46] that'll bring reproach to them who
[30:48] reject it
[30:49] see that that voice is echoing out that
[30:51] he that written epistle
[30:52] read of all men it's out to this world
[30:55] and and what they do with it
[30:56] that's between them and god but your job
[30:59] is to minister to the world
[31:01] to shine that light to the world to to
[31:03] give what god has given you
[31:05] to them amen all right and if they
[31:08] reject it
[31:09] that's not your deal they say no one
[31:11] could put a finger on his or her life
[31:12] they're sweet
[31:13] living if there ever was a man of god
[31:15] it's that man or that woman see
[31:17] live your sermons don't try to preach
[31:19] them if you're not called to be a
[31:20] preacher you'll get all mixed up anyhow
[31:22] messed up you'll get people tangled up
[31:24] and you won't know you'll ruin them
[31:26] and yourself too so you you stay in your
[31:29] lane you stay where god has called you
[31:31] just leave your sermon the preacher is
[31:33] called to preach his
[31:34] and to live it too so don't think we're
[31:36] exempt from that
[31:37] if you can't live it then you stop
[31:39] preaching it now now we're always
[31:40] preaching a little higher than where
[31:42] we're living because
[31:43] we've got to grow right amen there's
[31:46] always that room to grow
[31:48] we ain't there yet friends none of us
[31:51] have crossed the line
[31:52] and the good news is we're all going to
[31:53] cross it at the same time
[31:56] the apostle paul is waiting on us amen
[31:58] oh
[31:59] luther is waiting on us william branham
[32:01] is waiting on us
[32:03] we're all going to cross at the same
[32:04] time so you might think you're not as
[32:06] spiritually far as somebody else but
[32:08] know this
[32:09] there's going to be a quick short work
[32:10] and we're all going to cross that line
[32:12] right at the same time so you're you're
[32:15] supposed to live it he says
[32:16] oh how we need it in jeffersonville
[32:19] thousands of
[32:20] lived voices lived voices the thunder of
[32:23] god thundering out and sweetness and
[32:25] holiness purity
[32:26] undefiled lives walking around the earth
[32:29] today without blemish
[32:30] yes sir real christians that's the
[32:32] thunder against the enemy the devil
[32:33] don't care how loud you can haul her
[32:35] he don't care how much you can jump how
[32:37] much you can do this or that or shout
[32:39] what that
[32:40] hurts the devil is to see that
[32:41] sanctified holy life consecrated to god
[32:44] say anything to him call him anything
[32:46] and he's just as sweet as he can be and
[32:47] move right on
[32:49] oh my that throws him away that's the
[32:51] thunder that shakes the devil
[32:53] and so we're talking about ministry
[32:55] we're talking about a life here and
[32:57] and as we look here at the what paul is
[33:01] saying here about ministry
[33:02] uh there's uh he's speaking here and
[33:05] he's talking about
[33:06] uh the fact that ministry is not an easy
[33:09] thing
[33:10] and that's what we're going to be
[33:11] talking about today and and whether it's
[33:13] a pulpit ministry or your individual
[33:15] ministry
[33:16] know this life is not easy
[33:20] all right and if you're called to be a
[33:22] christian if you're called
[33:23] by god it gets just a little harder
[33:26] because now you've got all hell working
[33:28] against you
[33:29] he don't care about what the world's
[33:31] doing he's got them his guns are trained
[33:33] on you
[33:34] and so anybody who who tries to tell you
[33:37] well once you give your life to christ
[33:38] once you surrender to him once you get
[33:40] the holy ghost everything's going to be
[33:41] easy everything's going to be smooth
[33:43] you're not going to have any bumps
[33:44] i'm sorry friends but they're selling
[33:46] you something there you need to
[33:48] you need to this is why jesus says
[33:52] make your decision man don't look back
[33:55] you you look forward you could if you
[33:57] put your hand to the cloud don't look
[33:59] back
[33:59] but understand it's going to be a rough
[34:01] road
[34:03] we're not trying to sell you something
[34:04] here today we're letting you know
[34:07] it's not going to be easy you're either
[34:09] in
[34:10] a trial or you're coming out of a trial
[34:15] or you're about to go into a trial
[34:17] because you aren't taking anything with
[34:19] you out of this life but your character
[34:21] and it is through trials that god molds
[34:24] and shapes those characters
[34:26] james tells us to rejoice when we're in
[34:28] trials
[34:29] now he's not being a masochist he's not
[34:31] he's not into
[34:32] pain and suffering but he's it's a
[34:34] reality of of knowing that god
[34:36] uses those things to shape and to mold
[34:39] us
[34:40] and so he tells us in galatians 6 not to
[34:42] be weary and well-doing
[34:44] because we we can begin in whatever our
[34:46] ministry is whether whether
[34:48] you're a truck driver you've got some
[34:49] type of ministry if you're a housewife
[34:51] you've got some type of ministry if
[34:52] you're standing in a pulpit you've got
[34:54] some type of ministry
[34:55] if you're working the sound board you've
[34:57] got a ministry if you're working
[34:58] the instruments here that is a ministry
[35:01] and you can you can think nobody
[35:02] appreciates it nobody cares nobody sees
[35:04] it but know this
[35:05] god keeps good books
[35:09] god knows he knows the secret things he
[35:11] said don't stand on the corners and
[35:13] and pray out loud and look all somber
[35:16] and all this stuff in front of the
[35:17] crowds he said the ones who do that they
[35:19] have their reward
[35:20] the people are they're there for the
[35:22] attention and they get it and that's all
[35:23] they'll ever get out of it
[35:25] but he says what you do in secret god
[35:27] knows and he will reward you for it
[35:29] so don't get weary in what god's called
[35:31] you to do don't think
[35:32] don't think that god doesn't see it
[35:34] don't think that god isn't working don't
[35:35] think that god isn't moving
[35:37] don't think that god doesn't appreciate
[35:38] you
[35:40] he keeps good books amen yeah and what
[35:42] what would you rather and this is the
[35:44] point of this chapter as we get to the
[35:46] end here and not trying to skip
[35:48] but but when we get to it is we we tend
[35:50] to focus on the temporal
[35:52] we tend to focus on the earthly we tend
[35:54] to focus on the
[35:55] the the moment rather than realizing
[35:58] that we're
[35:58] in this for the long haul there's a much
[36:02] bigger picture to look at and this is
[36:04] why paul
[36:05] could dust himself off after being
[36:07] beaten in the street and left
[36:08] stoned they thought he was dead paul who
[36:11] was in a city
[36:12] and the rumor was out that they the men
[36:14] had forsaken food and promised they
[36:16] would never take another meal
[36:18] until paul was dead that he had to be
[36:20] snuck out of the city at night
[36:22] let down in a basket over the wall paul
[36:26] could could forsake all of the the the
[36:28] trappings of the pharisees and all the
[36:31] the renown and reputation and the fancy
[36:34] meals and the fancy clothes and
[36:36] the the brand new cadillac camel he
[36:38] could he could forsake all of that stuff
[36:41] because he could see the eternal he knew
[36:43] that there was christ waiting at the end
[36:45] of the road
[36:46] and that held him through all of those
[36:49] circumstances
[36:51] and so we see that he tells us not to be
[36:53] weary brother branham echoes this
[36:55] don't be ever be weary in well-doing for
[36:56] you will certainly reap in due season
[36:58] if you faint not always do that which is
[37:01] right
[37:02] doing that which is right always is not
[37:05] the easiest road
[37:07] whatever that god has said in his book
[37:09] you believe that
[37:10] and you can hang your soul on any phase
[37:14] of the word of god it's good to know you
[37:17] have an absolute
[37:18] in a day in an age where people they
[37:20] don't even know which restrooms to use
[37:22] they don't they're so confused we don't
[37:24] even know how they don't know how many
[37:25] genders there are
[37:26] things that were pretty simple man i
[37:28] thought i had down in kindergarten we've
[37:30] got adults trying to scratch in their
[37:31] head trying to figure out
[37:33] but we have an absolute and we know that
[37:35] god's word is eternal and we can hold to
[37:37] it
[37:38] he says you believe that don't you he
[37:40] says whatever he has promised in his
[37:42] word
[37:42] that god will do because he's under god
[37:45] obligation
[37:46] to his word he's not under obligation to
[37:48] your feelings he's not under obligation
[37:50] to your concerns
[37:51] or your worries he's under obligation to
[37:53] his word amen
[37:55] and so well if we go back here to verse
[37:58] 13 it says this chapter 4 verse 13 if
[38:02] you want to throw it up
[38:03] it says we have the same spirit of faith
[38:07] according as is written i believe and
[38:10] therefore have i spoken
[38:12] and we also believe and therefore speak
[38:14] so he says
[38:15] he says this was as it is written so
[38:18] anytime i find in the bible where it
[38:20] says as it was written
[38:22] i like to know where it was written
[38:26] what's he talking about where is he
[38:27] what's he referencing so
[38:29] he's actually quoting psalms 116
[38:32] verse 10 i believed therefore have i
[38:35] spoken
[38:36] but if you throw up psalm 116 go ahead
[38:39] and throw it up there verse 10 if you
[38:40] got it
[38:41] i'll take another drink while you do
[38:44] that
[38:48] you you love him this morning amen amen
[38:51] so
[38:51] psalm 116 verse 10 it says this i
[38:55] believe
[38:55] therefore have i spoken
[38:58] i was greatly afflicted
[39:02] see when paul quotes this in second
[39:04] corinthians he quotes twice
[39:07] what was written and he quotes the first
[39:09] part there i have spoke
[39:11] i believed therefore i've spoken i
[39:13] believe therefore i speak
[39:15] he's quoting this scripture and he
[39:17] leaves out and in psalm 116 verse 10
[39:19] there's a colon there and that colon
[39:21] connects the two thoughts
[39:24] remember that from grammar school the
[39:27] colon connects it
[39:28] i believed i spoke i was afflicted
[39:32] and paul leaves this out because he had
[39:34] already said we're troubled on every
[39:36] side
[39:36] not distressed we're perplexed but not
[39:38] in despair we're
[39:40] persecuted but not forsaken were cast
[39:42] down but not destroyed
[39:43] he had already laid out affliction is
[39:45] part of the package
[39:47] and so he's he's laying out the rest of
[39:49] it and these three things
[39:52] are the the spokes of the wheel upon
[39:55] which the gospel rides
[39:58] so i'm just letting you know right now
[40:00] if anybody sold you a deal
[40:02] that hey become a preacher it's an easy
[40:04] life
[40:06] know this this is the ride
[40:10] believing speaking being afflicted
[40:13] amen suffering for the sake of the
[40:16] gospel
[40:16] this is what it rides upon and and so
[40:19] don't think it's an easy road and know
[40:21] this that your ministry
[40:23] no matter how insignificant you think it
[40:25] might be
[40:27] rides on the same wheel god doesn't do
[40:30] anything different for the fellow behind
[40:31] the desk as he
[40:32] does for the ones out there it's the
[40:34] same manner brother branham says that
[40:36] this man
[40:37] the the the holiest of the holy manna
[40:39] it's the same manna
[40:40] it's just set aside with a special
[40:42] anointing but it's the same manner
[40:45] you gotta go sit down the same road
[40:46] friends
[40:48] so we see that faith speaking suffering
[40:51] this is
[40:51] the three spokes of gospel ministry uh
[40:54] the cycle upon which we
[40:56] we move and and you're always in one
[40:58] step of this cycle and sometimes you're
[40:59] all in all three at the same time
[41:02] anyone who stepped in the pulpit knows
[41:03] that sometimes you're suffering while
[41:04] you're speaking and struggling to
[41:06] believe
[41:07] amen yeah we struggle sometimes too
[41:11] friends
[41:12] and so we're on this wheel and he says
[41:14] he says faith moves us to speak
[41:16] which brings problems which drives us
[41:19] deeper in
[41:20] christ that is the purpose of the
[41:22] affliction
[41:23] to look the devil don't like when you
[41:26] talk about god
[41:27] he don't like it when you share the
[41:28] gospel he don't like it when you share
[41:30] your testimony
[41:31] but it's by your testimony and the blood
[41:34] of the lamb
[41:35] that we overcome and so that's all i can
[41:38] do as a minister is all i can do is
[41:40] testify
[41:41] what this word has done for me i have to
[41:43] speak from experience any
[41:45] true ministry is one that speaks from
[41:48] experience
[41:49] and you get experience not by sitting in
[41:52] an easy chair
[41:54] not by coasting but by going through the
[41:57] cycle of believing
[41:58] and speaking and suffering for it the
[42:01] devil
[42:02] don't like it he's going to bring
[42:03] suffering but god
[42:05] takes and my two favorite words in the
[42:08] entire bible
[42:09] are these but god yeah right amen
[42:12] i don't care what your situation is you
[42:15] need to throw
[42:16] what god at the end of it yeah well i
[42:19] i've got some heart trouble and the
[42:21] doctors just don't give me much hope
[42:23] but god who is rich in mercy amen
[42:26] is more than able to take care of the
[42:29] problem
[42:30] but god are the two greatest words in
[42:33] the entire bible
[42:35] and so we see that that god moves in
[42:39] and and he uses this mechanism
[42:42] because when when you begin preaching
[42:45] when you begin
[42:45] sharing your ministry when you begin
[42:47] testifying the devil hears it
[42:50] and i know you all just had a 50th
[42:52] jubilee
[42:54] know this the devil heard it
[42:58] all right buckle your seat belts amen
[43:02] i i'm trying to help you here to let you
[43:05] know
[43:06] whenever you brag on god the devil hears
[43:08] it and he don't like it
[43:10] and know this affliction or suffering
[43:12] will follow
[43:14] he's going to bring it on and so we we
[43:16] see that it
[43:17] but this affliction it drives us to
[43:20] to a place with god this is what it is
[43:22] meant to do
[43:24] it's to drive us deeper in our need for
[43:26] god
[43:27] drive us deeper in our faith right amen
[43:30] we go deeper we reach we the harder the
[43:34] pressure the
[43:35] the bigger the affliction the more we've
[43:37] got to get down on our knees
[43:39] and reach out to an almighty god who can
[43:41] lift us above the circumstances
[43:44] and that is the purpose of the
[43:45] affliction and what comes out of that
[43:47] is a greater faith a greater trust
[43:51] a greater love in god and from that
[43:54] we believe more of his word and and it
[43:57] inspires us to speak more of what god
[43:59] has done
[44:01] and the cycle keeps spinning friends
[44:03] this is how it moves this is how it
[44:05] operates
[44:06] i it's as simple as it is
[44:10] don't miss the mechanism upon which god
[44:14] moves
[44:16] deep faith inspiration revelation
[44:18] enliven us
[44:19] fire us and under the burden of the word
[44:21] to seek the face of god
[44:23] and like moses to bring that glory to
[44:25] the congregation in the hopes that they
[44:27] too will seek a deeper faith
[44:28] and walk with christ it inspires us to
[44:31] speak to cry out the glories of god to
[44:33] encourage others
[44:34] to nurture the weak to correct the way
[44:36] we're to enlighten the uninformed
[44:38] and to become and it becomes a fire
[44:40] inside the minister
[44:42] and so we speak we can't help but speak
[44:46] can't help but minister i'll just say
[44:48] this preachers preach
[44:50] no one no one has been called to push
[44:53] play
[44:54] hey man
[45:00] it's not in my notes but i tell you this
[45:03] and i and i'm saying this as a preacher
[45:05] so
[45:05] i am obviously biased
[45:10] but preachers preach why would paul
[45:13] spend so much time
[45:14] talking about preaching talking about
[45:16] the burden of the word talking about the
[45:18] the requirements talking about all these
[45:20] things
[45:21] we preach you get two preachers alone
[45:25] together and i tell you what they'll be
[45:26] preaching to one another for hours
[45:29] preachers wives i feel so sorry for them
[45:33] they get preached too more than any
[45:34] other group of people upon the face of
[45:36] the earth
[45:38] got to share god you got to tell
[45:39] somebody and so boom there it goes
[45:44] brother branham out there preaching the
[45:45] squirrels i know he did sometimes
[45:48] preachers preach they can't help it and
[45:52] first peter chapter 4 verse 10 is every
[45:54] man hath received the gift
[45:56] every man amen has to receive the gift
[45:59] even so
[46:00] minister the same one to another as
[46:03] good stewards of the manifold grace of
[46:05] god
[46:06] each of you has a gift of ministry and
[46:08] you're you're to use that ministry one
[46:10] to another
[46:11] and your gift is in my gift and my gift
[46:13] isn't your gift and each gift is unique
[46:15] i'm never gonna be a jewel forney as
[46:17] much as i think he is an awesome
[46:19] preacher
[46:19] he has a unique gift he has a unique
[46:22] talent and i'll never take his place and
[46:23] he can never take my place and
[46:25] i would never even seek to try
[46:28] we have a unique gift don't try to be
[46:30] anyone else be genuine
[46:33] find what god has called you to do amen
[46:37] and it says if any man speak so if we're
[46:39] going to speak let him speak as the
[46:41] oracles of god
[46:43] not as paul said we're not preaching
[46:45] ourselves
[46:46] we're not brother samuel doesn't preach
[46:48] himself none of these ministers preach
[46:50] themselves they're preaching christ to
[46:51] you
[46:53] and so we let them speak as the oracles
[46:55] of god and if any man minister let him
[46:57] do with the ability which
[46:58] god give us that's it i can't be anybody
[47:02] but who i am
[47:04] when the spirit of god moves on me
[47:05] sometimes i cheer up and i bawl like a
[47:07] big baby
[47:08] and i wished it was not so right but
[47:11] that is who i
[47:12] am amen brother wade has a unique gift
[47:15] each one of these ministers have a
[47:16] unique you have a unique gift
[47:18] and you use it how god has given
[47:21] you to use it you'd figure it out i've
[47:24] had people tell me how
[47:26] how how what's your process for coming
[47:28] up with a thought me and brother wade
[47:30] he's got a certain application he's got
[47:32] a certain way he
[47:33] studies and thoughts come to him and he
[47:35] puts it down and he does things
[47:37] and my way is just haphazard he just
[47:39] comes at me just flies at me
[47:42] and other ministers they have a whole
[47:43] different process her brother donny
[47:46] reagan said sometimes he's two three
[47:47] months
[47:48] out on his next sermon i'm usually two
[47:51] three hours
[47:52] out on my next sermon
[47:57] if i had two three months i'd rewrite it
[47:59] 50 million times
[48:03] if i get too much time i i've done
[48:05] thrown the thing away a half dozen times
[48:07] and started over somewhere else
[48:08] each man has a different gift and god
[48:12] is the ability which god giveth that god
[48:14] in all things
[48:16] may be glorified through jesus christ to
[48:19] whom he prays in dominion forever and
[48:21] ever
[48:22] god has that variety for a purpose
[48:24] because my ministry
[48:26] and brother wades and brother samuels
[48:27] and brother bob's and all
[48:29] they each have a different niche in
[48:31] which they operate to the fullest
[48:34] that's why we don't have just one pastor
[48:36] this is why we don't just have
[48:38] one evangelist one teacher and one
[48:40] prophet god uses all those gifts to
[48:42] reach into different niches and
[48:44] different things because
[48:45] your experience and your perspective is
[48:47] different than mine
[48:50] peter and john had totally different
[48:52] perspectives on things
[48:54] peter was cutting ears off and john was
[48:57] talking about love
[48:59] that's why god sent them out together
[49:04] you cut the year off and i'll put it up
[49:05] and bandage it and god bless you we'll
[49:07] pray for you keep you in prayer you're
[49:08] hearing okay thank you very much
[49:10] have a nice day sorry about that
[49:14] two different approaches but the same
[49:17] god working
[49:19] read the books of john they're all about
[49:21] love they're all about this and
[49:23] your brother is very deep very poetic
[49:25] paul peter's just very matter of fact
[49:30] worry about your conversation god
[49:32] destroyed the old world
[49:34] worry about how you conduct yourselves
[49:36] peter had a different outlook
[49:38] than john did but it's the same god
[49:42] brother braham says this so they think
[49:43] today that the reason christianity has
[49:45] become to the people
[49:46] a nut is because we've got a bunch of
[49:49] reproductions and not genuine christians
[49:53] this is why people think we're crazy
[49:54] we're different
[49:56] i tell you anyone who who would give up
[49:59] their sunday
[50:00] to sit in a crowded hot building to
[50:03] listen to some man sputter and stutter
[50:05] and spit at you
[50:07] for a couple hours you're a little crazy
[50:11] a little crazy could be fishing
[50:14] could be golfing could be doing all
[50:16] kinds of things right
[50:18] but i'd rather be a little crazy
[50:22] and gain eternal life
[50:26] then be all got it together like the
[50:29] world does
[50:30] and lose it all amen so the world might
[50:33] think we're nuts but it's the nuts to
[50:35] hold the thing together
[50:39] so a bunch that has to he said uh uh not
[50:42] genuine christians a bunch that has to
[50:44] be babied and
[50:45] sprayed in order to stay in church i can
[50:47] imagine the very first church
[50:48] that they were compared to the
[50:49] reproduction of today that we would be a
[50:52] cheap reproduction of what the first
[50:54] church was oh god help us not to be that
[50:57] that rugged believers in god with the
[50:58] holy ghost you babied not
[51:00] them you didn't have to pat them and
[51:03] tell them you take them
[51:04] in this one and if they got tired of
[51:06] that one they go to another one and
[51:07] you'll make them a deacon if they'll
[51:09] come over here and leave that other one
[51:10] he said that's a hybrid reproduction i
[51:13] was thinking of michelangelo's original
[51:15] painting i believe the last supper when
[51:16] he painted it
[51:17] you realize that the original what it
[51:19] would cost you
[51:20] it would be countless thousands of
[51:23] dollars
[51:24] would would never touch the original
[51:25] because it's beyond price
[51:28] it's so valued so high but you could buy
[51:31] a cheap reproduction of it for about two
[51:33] dollars
[51:35] that's why people today can't understand
[51:37] the ruggedness of
[51:38] real genuine believers they become a nut
[51:41] you know the world gets in such a rut
[51:43] until every once in a while
[51:44] uh that's a little different and he's a
[51:46] nut to that generation
[51:48] i was thinking the other day who who is
[51:49] abel who today
[51:51] is not a nut
[51:55] and this is in 1964 when he preached the
[51:57] oddball he said who today
[51:58] isn't enough who today isn't crazy
[52:01] and if the world was going crazy in
[52:03] 1964. here in 2021
[52:05] i tell you friends you'd be hard-pressed
[52:09] to find anybody to find this saying
[52:10] that's right amen
[52:12] he preached about the neurosis and the
[52:14] problems of that day
[52:16] oh we're so far beyond that man
[52:18] depression and everything
[52:20] this this last pandemic the number of
[52:23] suicides during that time
[52:25] was what five to ten times what had been
[52:29] the world's losing its mind friends he
[52:31] says you're somebody's nut
[52:33] i believe the world is completely going
[52:35] in and saying
[52:36] you know it's a time that people can't
[52:38] judge between right or wrong
[52:40] and truth and error yeah this is the
[52:43] time we're living in
[52:45] and so satan doesn't like it when we
[52:46] testify he doesn't like it when we share
[52:48] god's word you'd be genuine in the
[52:50] ministry that god's given you
[52:52] satan doesn't and he's not going to like
[52:53] it i'm warning you
[52:55] i'm warning you he's not going to like
[52:57] it
[52:59] when you're doing right people always
[53:01] wonder i've done right
[53:03] i've done this i've done that i've done
[53:05] this why are bad things happening
[53:08] because you've done right
[53:14] that's why bad things happen to good
[53:17] people
[53:18] that's the world we live in amen he
[53:20] doesn't like it when we talk about the
[53:22] lord he's going to bring the heat
[53:24] so speaking it brings suffering or
[53:26] affliction when you talk about what
[53:27] god's done when you testified about god
[53:29] done
[53:30] when when you get up in church how many
[53:31] of you could raise your hand and say
[53:32] well
[53:33] you know i got up and testified in
[53:34] church and what god did or i testified
[53:36] somebody at work i testified this
[53:37] and man the week after that was just it
[53:39] seemed like everything going wrong
[53:43] been there done that got the t-shirt
[53:49] wonder not that's right it's part of the
[53:52] process
[53:54] suffering will either bring you to your
[53:55] knees and desperate hope and a widening
[53:58] faith
[53:59] a deep calling to the deep
[54:03] or it'll crush you
[54:06] it'll make you better or it'll make you
[54:08] bitter so in this time of affliction or
[54:11] suffering
[54:11] this is where we're being trained where
[54:14] we're being molded
[54:16] and why christ speak brother abraham
[54:17] said this he said now moses being called
[54:18] for this purpose but he was a man and
[54:20] god trained him 80 years
[54:23] before he was ever able to use him amen
[54:28] 80 years 40 years in the palace 40 years
[54:31] in the wilderness and god can train a
[54:33] man
[54:34] take him 100 years for
[54:37] 30 minutes of work god knows how
[54:41] to train amen amen all right
[54:45] 100 years of work i did
[54:48] i found it i was looking for the wrong
[54:50] thing but i found it
[54:52] a hundred years of work for 30 minutes
[54:55] of ministry
[54:59] we want to talk about a grinding
[55:00] mechanism amen
[55:02] suffering for 100 years being trained
[55:04] and molded and so that you might
[55:06] speak for 30 minutes he's building your
[55:10] faith
[55:11] so that when you speak it's with
[55:13] demonstration
[55:15] and the power of the holy ghost and not
[55:17] with men's wisdom
[55:21] and so you're gonna suffer paul says
[55:23] this in second timothy or
[55:25] uh yeah second timothy 3 11 it says
[55:27] persecutions
[55:28] afflictions which came into me in
[55:29] antioch and iconium and lystra
[55:31] what persecutions i endured but out of
[55:34] them all the lord delivered me
[55:36] yea and all that live godly in christ
[55:38] jesus
[55:39] shall suffer persecution amen
[55:42] second corinthians 1 verse 8 for we
[55:45] would not brother this is paul in the
[55:47] same book just a few chapters
[55:49] prior here we were in chapter four now
[55:51] we're going back to chapter one verse
[55:52] eight
[55:52] for we would not brethren have you
[55:54] ignorant of our trouble which came to us
[55:56] in
[55:56] asia that we were pressed out of measure
[55:59] above strength in so much that we
[56:02] despaired
[56:03] even of life amen paul said i got into
[56:06] such
[56:07] dire straits that i thought this is it
[56:10] this is the end i'm giving up i'm giving
[56:13] in
[56:14] there's what's the point of even living
[56:17] this is paul the man who was caught up
[56:18] to the third heaven this is paul
[56:22] who saw the the light
[56:25] knocked off his high horse he saw all
[56:28] those things and yet he was at a point
[56:30] he was so
[56:30] pressed for the wade his whole pushed so
[56:33] under pressure he despaired even of his
[56:35] life
[56:37] he said but we have the sentence of
[56:38] death in ourselves
[56:41] this is the thing people they take that
[56:43] scripture now first corinthians 10 13
[56:45] that there's no temptation taking you
[56:47] but which is common to man but god is
[56:49] faithful he will not suffer you to be
[56:50] tempted above that which you are able
[56:52] people people take that and say god will
[56:54] never put on you more than you can bear
[56:56] i beg to differ god will put on you more
[56:59] than you can bear
[57:00] in yourself paul said
[57:04] in ourselves we were pressed out of
[57:06] measure
[57:08] under the sentence of death that we
[57:09] should not trust in ourselves
[57:12] god pushes you beyond what you're able
[57:14] to bear
[57:15] so you won't trust in yourself here's
[57:18] what he did
[57:19] but in god who raiseth the dead
[57:23] he says i thought it was over i thought
[57:24] it was dead i was at the point of just
[57:26] giving up and
[57:27] and laying down and dying but god who is
[57:30] able to raise the dead
[57:32] came and stepped into the situation amen
[57:35] who delivered us from so great at death
[57:38] and duck deliver us and
[57:40] will deliver paul came out of that
[57:44] experience with a deeper
[57:45] faith that is the purpose of trials
[57:50] to give us a deeper faith to to drive us
[57:53] to our knees
[57:54] to drive us to a place of desperation
[57:56] drive us to a place where we recognize
[57:59] uh and we admit as our brother said
[58:02] we raise our hands and say i surrender
[58:04] all
[58:05] i recognize i cannot do this i need the
[58:08] almighty to step
[58:09] in and to hold my hands up amen
[58:17] and that's why paul could say in
[58:18] philippians 4 13
[58:20] i can do all things through christ who
[58:23] strengthens me
[58:25] amen so suffering drives you deeper in
[58:29] faith
[58:29] until you buckle under the weight of
[58:31] suffering if you aren't careful
[58:34] because if you do it'll make you a
[58:35] castaway and that breaks the wheel
[58:39] you got to have at least three spokes in
[58:40] a wheel
[58:43] got to have three they've tried to make
[58:44] it with two and they just don't look
[58:46] right
[58:48] it's got to have three you ever seen a
[58:50] stool with two legs
[58:55] it's a little awkward
[58:59] and he's the third leg you gotta have
[59:02] faith
[59:03] yeah amen it's going to drive you to
[59:04] speak right amen
[59:06] and you're going to suffer for it right
[59:07] amen and that
[59:10] is the foundation upon which the gospel
[59:12] stands
[59:15] so first corinthians 9 25 27
[59:18] says and every man that's striving for
[59:20] the mastery must be temperate
[59:22] mastery is temporary in all things now
[59:23] they do it to obtain a corruptable crown
[59:25] but we an incorruptable
[59:27] i therefore so run not as uncertainty
[59:30] and so fight not as one that beateth the
[59:31] ear but i keep my body and bring it
[59:33] under subjection lest that any means
[59:35] when i have preached to other i myself
[59:38] might be a castaway
[59:39] paul is saying i gotta i gotta make sure
[59:41] that i don't buckle under affliction i
[59:43] don't fall under suffering i don't fall
[59:45] and or the suffering of good times
[59:48] all right amen come on now yeah
[59:51] israel suffered and buckled under good
[59:53] times yes they did
[59:55] they forgot what god had done for him
[59:58] i tell you sometimes we need
[1:00:01] pressure yeah amen
[1:00:05] need pressure to perform things get too
[1:00:08] easy and we just
[1:00:09] drift and we'll talk about that maybe
[1:00:11] this afternoon but
[1:00:12] but we we need a little pressure to keep
[1:00:14] us moving and so leaderships and
[1:00:16] callings
[1:00:17] bring suffering and you're all called to
[1:00:19] something
[1:00:20] and the higher the calling the higher
[1:00:23] the suffering
[1:00:25] there's many people who would love to
[1:00:27] have had the ministry of william brown
[1:00:32] i remember when i was young and dumb
[1:00:37] i used to think it would be awesome to
[1:00:39] have that that
[1:00:40] discernment that he had
[1:00:44] but could you imagine walking out and
[1:00:46] shaking somebody's hand
[1:00:49] and having them tell you i love you
[1:00:52] appreciate you do anything for you i can
[1:00:55] and you didn't have the discernment to
[1:00:57] know that just five minutes prior they
[1:00:59] stabbed you in the back run you down
[1:01:03] didn't feel that way at all about you
[1:01:07] and he would smile and shake their hand
[1:01:10] give them a big hug said i love you
[1:01:14] that's christ
[1:01:17] i as a mortal man couldn't do that for
[1:01:19] him amen
[1:01:21] that's christ on display
[1:01:25] so we see the suffering the the greater
[1:01:27] the calling the greater the suffering we
[1:01:28] can we can look at
[1:01:29] that and and when i talk about suffering
[1:01:31] i want you to know this
[1:01:35] i'm not talking the first church we tend
[1:01:37] to when we read the bible
[1:01:39] we tend to think of a suffering for
[1:01:41] christ and things like that we think
[1:01:42] about
[1:01:42] we think about the first church he was
[1:01:44] fed to lions
[1:01:46] who was actively beaten and and
[1:01:48] threatened and did things like that
[1:01:50] but i tell you the the strain that we're
[1:01:53] under
[1:01:54] we're not under an oxage we're under a
[1:01:57] different age
[1:01:58] and the strain is right here
[1:02:04] the greatest battle ever fought is right
[1:02:07] here
[1:02:08] this is where the suffering takes place
[1:02:10] what people said about us
[1:02:12] what people have done what this and that
[1:02:15] and all these different situations
[1:02:16] we got we got uh uh and leadership in
[1:02:19] the ministry it's
[1:02:20] it's people constantly uh questioning
[1:02:22] the leadership moses had to deal with
[1:02:24] that
[1:02:24] uh criticizing people being critic
[1:02:26] critical all the time of every little
[1:02:28] thing people
[1:02:29] people leaving the church discord among
[1:02:31] the body uh
[1:02:32] marriage has become strained joy is lost
[1:02:35] in the home and the family and these
[1:02:36] things and these pressures begin to
[1:02:38] mount
[1:02:38] and your failures because we we have
[1:02:41] failures
[1:02:42] they accumulate and and when things
[1:02:44] don't go as expected and people
[1:02:45] people start looking for someone to
[1:02:47] blame
[1:02:48] remember david at ziklag
[1:02:52] his mighty men of valor the ones who
[1:02:55] would fight through a line of
[1:02:56] philistines to get him a drink of water
[1:03:00] were the same ones at ziklag who picked
[1:03:03] up stones
[1:03:04] to stone him but god was shaping that
[1:03:08] man for a throne
[1:03:09] right amen ziklag was his final test
[1:03:13] before he took the sermon amen right
[1:03:16] there
[1:03:17] and david had no one to encourage him he
[1:03:19] had he could have given up he could have
[1:03:21] walked away
[1:03:22] but he encouraged himself in the lord
[1:03:25] amen he fell on his knees and dug a
[1:03:27] little deeper
[1:03:28] and his faith rose to the occasion
[1:03:32] amen and we can see we can see the
[1:03:35] pressures mount moses
[1:03:37] in exodus four uh and for the sake of
[1:03:39] time because i'm running out quick
[1:03:41] for the sake of time we can see moses
[1:03:43] the strain on his family life
[1:03:46] ministry doesn't just it's not just the
[1:03:48] fellow behind the pulpit
[1:03:50] preachers kids yeah i heard a few
[1:03:57] the pressure the spotlight the
[1:04:00] the the demand upon that has such an
[1:04:04] effect
[1:04:05] that's an affliction all these all these
[1:04:08] pressures and all these things molding
[1:04:11] and shaping
[1:04:12] and to do what not to cause us to drift
[1:04:15] not to cause us to fall not to cause us
[1:04:17] to give up
[1:04:18] amen but to drive us to a deeper place
[1:04:21] with christ but moses himself
[1:04:24] and in exodus chapter four and beginning
[1:04:27] verse 18 and
[1:04:28] for you uh you can read it on your own
[1:04:30] but god gives goals as a commission
[1:04:32] you're going to go down
[1:04:33] load up load up the car put your wife
[1:04:35] and kids in it
[1:04:36] and you're going to head down to egypt
[1:04:38] and you're going to tell pharaoh to let
[1:04:39] my people go
[1:04:40] and you're going to deliver them with a
[1:04:41] mighty hand and he's not going to listen
[1:04:43] to you
[1:04:43] and in that same chapter in verse 24 it
[1:04:46] came to pass
[1:04:47] by the way in the end that the lord met
[1:04:49] him and sought to kill him
[1:04:54] under the pressures of ministry moses
[1:04:57] forgot about
[1:04:58] his own family
[1:05:05] you all weren't ready for this today
[1:05:06] where are you good
[1:05:10] see it's not all better roses up here
[1:05:15] we can't just oh we're here we still got
[1:05:18] to take care of all this
[1:05:19] still got to manage all of this and you
[1:05:21] know
[1:05:23] his wife gave him what for
[1:05:28] what am i following you for i'm doing i
[1:05:29] have to do it all myself
[1:05:33] so we see the straight it puts strain on
[1:05:35] marriage
[1:05:36] preachers wives there's a huge strain
[1:05:39] there
[1:05:41] huge strain there people don't
[1:05:42] understand it i think they ought to be
[1:05:44] this way and they think they ought to be
[1:05:45] that way
[1:05:46] preacher's wife her ministry primary is
[1:05:49] take care of your husband
[1:05:50] amen i got a few amens on that one all
[1:05:54] right amen
[1:05:56] but we have all these expectations we
[1:05:57] have all these things and these
[1:05:58] pressures and all these afflictions that
[1:06:00] come against us and
[1:06:01] all these things mount up and and if we
[1:06:04] don't
[1:06:05] find that hidden place if we don't
[1:06:09] get down on our knees if we don't and
[1:06:11] and i'm not just talking about pulpit
[1:06:12] ministry you
[1:06:13] have the same pressures maybe not to the
[1:06:16] same degree but maybe not in the same
[1:06:17] avenue but you
[1:06:19] have the same pressures you men you've
[1:06:21] got a pressure to lead your home
[1:06:22] to to be there to provide for them to
[1:06:24] take care of them to
[1:06:26] to make sure they have all they have and
[1:06:27] if you don't you're worse than an
[1:06:29] infidel and have denied the faith
[1:06:31] that's a pressure that you you've got to
[1:06:33] either pick up and and shoulder and
[1:06:35] carry
[1:06:36] or you'll buckle under it amen
[1:06:39] and it's meant meant not for you to
[1:06:42] collapse
[1:06:43] but for you to come to the real the
[1:06:45] whole purpose of the law
[1:06:47] was to play so much burden upon the
[1:06:48] people that they realized they could not
[1:06:50] do it and needed a savior
[1:06:55] amen we see moses
[1:07:00] moses we can see that how the pressure
[1:07:04] at one point god says you know what i've
[1:07:05] had it with the people i'm just going to
[1:07:06] wipe them all out
[1:07:08] start over with you moses you're going
[1:07:10] to wipe everybody out start over with
[1:07:11] you
[1:07:12] moses throws himself on the feet of god
[1:07:14] and says no don't do it
[1:07:16] he stands in the gap for the people
[1:07:20] moses his faith drove him there
[1:07:24] that 80 years of experience was so that
[1:07:27] when when
[1:07:28] he got to that moment of affliction
[1:07:32] he didn't collapse amen oh he fell to
[1:07:35] his face he fell on his knees but i
[1:07:37] tell you he stood taller that day than
[1:07:39] he ever had before
[1:07:40] because god wouldn't look when god
[1:07:42] looked upon that he said that's
[1:07:44] that's the line running through that's
[1:07:46] the seed manifesting itself
[1:07:48] that's christ on display laying his life
[1:07:51] down
[1:07:52] for the people
[1:07:55] but amen also had bad days
[1:07:58] yes speak to the rock moses oh you bunch
[1:08:02] of rebels
[1:08:08] and moses lost his spot in the promised
[1:08:10] land
[1:08:12] buckling under the afflictions buckling
[1:08:16] under the persecution but look the
[1:08:19] scripture tells us
[1:08:21] not to look at things that are temporal
[1:08:23] but to look at things that are eternal
[1:08:24] amen
[1:08:27] moses may have lost his spot that day
[1:08:30] but when jesus stood on mount
[1:08:32] transfiguration
[1:08:37] moses was home
[1:08:42] he may have never stood up in that
[1:08:45] promised land with this physical body
[1:08:47] but i tell you he was there on the
[1:08:49] mountain next to jesus
[1:08:52] in the promised land friends and there
[1:08:55] was no devil could take that from him
[1:08:57] couldn't even find his body god had it
[1:09:00] reserved for a special day
[1:09:03] we think of god molding men shaping them
[1:09:05] for a hundred years for 30 years
[1:09:07] 30 minutes of ministry and and i think
[1:09:09] of jonah
[1:09:11] jonah brother graham says i thought of
[1:09:13] jonah a man of god a prophet
[1:09:15] who spoke who was spoke by god and sent
[1:09:18] down in nineveh with a message to those
[1:09:19] people and god was so
[1:09:21] determined and filled him so full of his
[1:09:23] spirit till he stayed alive three days
[1:09:25] and nights in the belly of a fish in the
[1:09:27] bottom of the sea
[1:09:28] and it came out with such power in his
[1:09:30] speech
[1:09:31] until the people listened to him and put
[1:09:33] sackcloth on their
[1:09:34] animals on the hills the whole city so
[1:09:38] ignorant one didn't know some of them
[1:09:39] didn't know the right hand
[1:09:40] from the left hand and but repented
[1:09:42] before god and spared the city and then
[1:09:44] after that inspiration left jonah he
[1:09:46] went
[1:09:46] he wanted to die and sat under the tree
[1:09:49] and asked god to take his life
[1:09:51] but god knew brother him
[1:09:54] there's various different quotes but he
[1:09:56] said that jonah was not out of the will
[1:09:58] of god
[1:09:58] when he wound up in the belly of that
[1:10:00] whale god
[1:10:02] knew he was going to have to get jonah
[1:10:04] to a place of desperation
[1:10:06] for the task ahead and you read read the
[1:10:10] book of jonah carefully jonah hated
[1:10:11] those people
[1:10:15] he did not want to preach to him he did
[1:10:17] not want god to spare them
[1:10:20] but god knew that if he spent three days
[1:10:24] in the belly of a whale when he come
[1:10:26] roaring out of that fish
[1:10:29] he would preach with a fire there ain't
[1:10:31] a preacher on this earth that's ever
[1:10:33] heard before
[1:10:35] he preached so hot they made sure not
[1:10:37] only they had things taken care of they
[1:10:39] made sure their animals had things taken
[1:10:41] care of
[1:10:42] god knew how to prepare that man
[1:10:45] for those sermons three
[1:10:48] three days in the belly of a whale to
[1:10:50] get him ready
[1:10:51] to preach to that one crowd
[1:10:55] amen he was afflicted
[1:10:58] so that while in the belly of that whale
[1:11:00] in affliction
[1:11:02] he turned toward jerusalem
[1:11:05] and it was only by the inspiration of
[1:11:07] the holy ghost he knew which direction
[1:11:08] to turn
[1:11:09] he might have judged well i know this
[1:11:11] fish is going to nineveh so it's
[1:11:13] probably about right there
[1:11:16] amen but here he is backslidden
[1:11:19] suffering
[1:11:20] afflicted in the belly of a whale and
[1:11:22] his faith reaches out
[1:11:24] yes amen and he knew that solomon said
[1:11:26] if they turn their face towards that
[1:11:27] city god would hear their prayer
[1:11:28] [Music]
[1:11:30] amen and his faith rose to a place
[1:11:33] that when he spoke it was with power
[1:11:38] and demonstration amen amen scared the
[1:11:41] life out of them
[1:11:48] and under the strain if we're not
[1:11:50] careful minister can begin to buckle and
[1:11:52] he can say you know what i'm done
[1:11:55] you can start to say you know the more i
[1:11:57] try to serve god
[1:11:58] just seems the worse things get
[1:12:02] that's natural
[1:12:06] the the devil's going to come against
[1:12:08] you amen
[1:12:10] don't buckle under buckle down
[1:12:14] dig a little deeper call upon god let
[1:12:17] his face
[1:12:18] build inside of you
[1:12:21] and jeremiah got to such a point with
[1:12:23] his preaching
[1:12:24] and the affliction that came from it he
[1:12:25] said i'm not going to do it i'm not
[1:12:27] going to do it anymore
[1:12:28] i said in jeremiah 20 verse 9 he says
[1:12:30] then i said i will not make mention of
[1:12:32] him
[1:12:33] i'm not even going to talk about god
[1:12:34] anymore i'm going to talk about them
[1:12:35] anymore
[1:12:36] nor speak any more of his name but his
[1:12:40] word was in mine heart
[1:12:42] as a burning fire shut up in my bones
[1:12:46] and i was weary with forbearing
[1:12:49] and i could not stay amen
[1:12:53] preachers preach
[1:12:57] amen brother man brother branham went
[1:13:00] through the same
[1:13:00] same thing how many of you listened to
[1:13:03] standing in the gap oh yeah
[1:13:04] amen brother branham went to a time he's
[1:13:07] he he said
[1:13:08] you know i'm going to give up on this
[1:13:10] thing he said uh well he said
[1:13:12] in chapter 108 he said uh paragraph 1
[1:13:15] wait he said so i come down from canada
[1:13:17] and with fred in them and the other day
[1:13:18] and in my mind i had it made up
[1:13:20] if these people don't want to hear my
[1:13:22] message all right they didn't have to
[1:13:24] getting an attitude under
[1:13:28] affliction under suffering
[1:13:32] began to build a complex and got to a
[1:13:35] point he says well if they're not going
[1:13:36] to listen to me then i'm just
[1:13:37] going to preach to him he did
[1:13:40] he he talked about it i'm not making
[1:13:42] this up he says i had preached now for
[1:13:44] about 35 years in the last 15 to 18
[1:13:46] years i've done nothing but
[1:13:48] just to the lord i've tried to live so
[1:13:50] close to him not say a word until he
[1:13:51] told me to
[1:13:52] first everything and people say now
[1:13:54] brother brahm tells you he's coming to
[1:13:56] remember look out for a meeting because
[1:13:57] he's come in the name of the lord and he
[1:13:58] won't do nothing to the lord tells
[1:14:00] that's right i waited till he told me he
[1:14:01] said i didn't move until he told me and
[1:14:03] then he he got so for the last few
[1:14:05] months he didn't tell me nothing about
[1:14:06] places to go there you go
[1:14:09] brother branham began to under the
[1:14:10] affliction and the suffering of
[1:14:12] a ministry got to a place
[1:14:15] where he says you know what i'm going to
[1:14:16] do and for the sake of time i'm just
[1:14:18] going to
[1:14:19] tell you the story and you can listen to
[1:14:20] it it's a good one
[1:14:23] brother branham said you know what i'm
[1:14:24] going to do he says i'm going to take my
[1:14:26] wife
[1:14:28] and i'm going to take her up on one of
[1:14:29] these mountains tell her i'm going on a
[1:14:30] hunting trip
[1:14:32] it says when i i get a kick out of this
[1:14:34] i'm going to grow my hair long
[1:14:37] that's what he said grow my hair long
[1:14:40] grow beard
[1:14:42] he's just going to let himself go and
[1:14:44] when god gives me a message i'll just
[1:14:46] come storming off the mountain and i'll
[1:14:47] bring it to the people and i'll head
[1:14:48] right back on up there
[1:14:51] that was his plan and him
[1:14:54] and billy are coming down out of montana
[1:14:55] and they pull into a diner and they're
[1:14:57] sitting there
[1:14:57] and they're they're sitting down at the

[1:16:37] the man that called men sissies for
[1:16:38] having long hair
[1:16:42] but that's the image that he wanted to
[1:16:45] be
[1:16:46] what got him there pressures
[1:16:51] suffering the everyday grind
[1:16:55] right of ministry people questioning him
[1:16:59] people uh uh uh fussing and fighting and
[1:17:02] this and that and the other and
[1:17:03] and meetings being uh him being uh uh
[1:17:07] scheduled to go places he hadn't even

[1:17:13] people coming in and out all the time
[1:17:15] had to throw somebody out of the
[1:17:17] basement was just wandering around
[1:17:21] the pressures got to a place brother
[1:17:24] branham
[1:17:25] i just watched that's it that's what i
[1:17:26] want to do give it all up and just be
[1:17:28] that
[1:17:30] and about that time he said he looked in
[1:17:32] the back and
[1:17:34] two bums come getting out of the out of
[1:17:36] a
[1:17:37] uh one of the booths and we're trying
[1:17:40] between the two of them to pay for a
[1:17:41] little cup of coffee and billy looked at
[1:17:44] him said that looks just like you
[1:17:46] and fletcher bro
[1:17:50] and it shook him right it shook him
[1:17:57] god was giving him a warning that third
[1:17:58] spoke
[1:18:00] of faith is wavering because
[1:18:03] suffering was getting a bit much
[1:18:09] and he was warning them you gotta find a
[1:18:12] place of rest
[1:18:14] you gotta turn to me you gotta
[1:18:17] let your faith increase
[1:18:23] brother's going down and you can read
[1:18:25] the story but brother
[1:18:26] he shares just a few paragraphs later he
[1:18:29] shares
[1:18:30] the the the prophecy that was given to
[1:18:33] him
[1:18:35] it says this now here's what it said
[1:18:37] because thou has chosen
[1:18:39] the narrow path the harder way
[1:18:43] thou hast walked in your own choosing
[1:18:47] now i can see that moses had to make his
[1:18:50] choice too see
[1:18:51] thou has picked up the precise and
[1:18:54] correct way
[1:18:55] correct decision and it is my way
[1:18:59] the holy spirit speaking back because of
[1:19:01] this momentous decision
[1:19:04] see that when that spoke of faith
[1:19:08] is under the weight of suffering you are
[1:19:11] at a moment of decision
[1:19:14] that's right amen you're going to buckle
[1:19:17] in
[1:19:18] or buckle down all right you're going to
[1:19:20] give in
[1:19:21] give up or give him praise
[1:19:26] what are you going to do yeah the choice
[1:19:28] is yours amen
[1:19:30] brother branham had a choice and god was
[1:19:32] showing them if you if you choose your
[1:19:33] way
[1:19:35] this is what will happen but because he
[1:19:38] chose
[1:19:39] the right way all right amen it says
[1:19:41] what oh
[1:19:42] it says because of this momentous
[1:19:44] decision a huge
[1:19:46] portion of heaven awaits you what a
[1:19:49] glorious
[1:19:50] decision what a glorious decision now
[1:19:53] has made this
[1:19:54] in itself is that which will make and
[1:19:56] come to pass
[1:19:57] the tremendous victory in love divine
[1:20:00] amen
[1:20:02] because he made the decision in the
[1:20:04] suffering
[1:20:06] and chose faith instead of his own past
[1:20:10] yes amen there was a reward not only for
[1:20:13] him
[1:20:14] but for us that's what
[1:20:17] ministry is for that's what it's all
[1:20:19] about this is why jesus said in
[1:20:21] in in mark 10 29 jesus answered and said
[1:20:24] verily i say unto you there is no man
[1:20:25] that has left house
[1:20:26] or brethren or sisters or father or
[1:20:29] mother
[1:20:29] or wife or children or lands for my sake
[1:20:32] in the gospel but he shall receive a
[1:20:34] hundredfold
[1:20:35] now in this time houses and brethren and
[1:20:38] sisters and mothers and children
[1:20:40] and lands with persecutions
[1:20:43] and in the world to come eternal lives
[1:20:48] oh i and i know it's a dad joke but you
[1:20:51] know
[1:20:53] ministry is it's not the greatest
[1:20:56] employment it's not the greatest job
[1:20:59] but it has an out of this world
[1:21:01] retirement plan
[1:21:09] this is why
[1:21:13] and we're closing so the musicians get
[1:21:15] get ready
[1:21:16] hebrews 11 24 says this by faith moses
[1:21:21] when he was come to years refused to be
[1:21:24] called the son
[1:21:25] of pharaoh's daughter but choosing
[1:21:27] rather to
[1:21:28] suffer affliction with the people of god
[1:21:32] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:21:35] season
[1:21:36] he had a choice you have a choice
[1:21:41] esteeming the reproach of christ greater
[1:21:44] riches than the treasures of egypt for
[1:21:46] he had respect unto the recompense of
[1:21:48] the reward
[1:21:49] by faith he forsook egypt not fearing
[1:21:52] the wrath of the king
[1:21:53] for he endured as seeing him
[1:21:57] who is invisible and that's what paul
[1:21:59] says we don't look to the scene
[1:22:01] but we look to the unseen we hold to the
[1:22:04] unseen
[1:22:05] we anchor to that to that which is
[1:22:07] eternal
[1:22:09] and that's what keeps us going that's
[1:22:11] what keeps the wheel spinning
[1:22:12] that's where you reach to when you're
[1:22:14] under the weight of affliction
[1:22:17] and through faith he kept the passover
[1:22:20] because moses made the right decision
[1:22:23] the children
[1:22:24] of israel were saved amen
[1:22:27] you're not in this alone ministry is all
[1:22:31] about
[1:22:32] someone else
[1:22:35] you got to take care of yourself too
[1:22:38] you can't you know the whole you're an
[1:22:40] airplane when that when the
[1:22:42] the pressure is released the mass drop
[1:22:45] they tell you to
[1:22:47] cover yourself before you turn to the
[1:22:49] child or to the elderly
[1:22:52] and that's what i'm telling you today
[1:22:54] don't try to save the world until you
[1:22:55] get
[1:22:56] to a place of complete and total
[1:22:58] surrender to god
[1:23:01] and he gives you the faith and strength
[1:23:03] because the
[1:23:05] you can endure on your own amen right
[1:23:08] but i can do all things
[1:23:10] through christ who strengthens me amen
[1:23:13] god bless you
