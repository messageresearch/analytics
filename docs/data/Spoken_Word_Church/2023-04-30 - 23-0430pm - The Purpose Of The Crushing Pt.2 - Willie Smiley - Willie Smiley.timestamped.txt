[13:06] and and freedom to be able to know the
[13:09] mind of God not guess that it's the mind

[22:11] amen singing that song just kind of
[22:14] brings back memories of sister Lewis uh
[22:18] I had the privilege of pastoring her for
[22:21] a few years that's brother Jack's that's
[22:24] my aunt and brother Jack's hot I she's
[22:27] my aunt through marriage and that's
[22:29] brother Jax uh his mother's sister and
[22:33] uh there'll be times in church you a
[22:36] preacher be preaching and she'd be
[22:38] writing songs
[22:39] it's just so unfortunate that she she
[22:43] passed away uh when she did because she
[22:47] left behind hundreds and hundreds of
[22:49] songs that she never had the opportunity
[22:52] to just even put music too
[22:55] and uh we don't even know where to find
[22:58] half of the things that she wrote uh
[23:01] that we could try to put music but we
[23:04] thank God for the things that uh she did
[23:07] and my my wife kind of put the always
[23:11] had to put the tune to it they would
[23:13] write it but my wife would kind of put
[23:16] produce it for him so we appreciate it
[23:19] it's a blessing to know that that song
[23:22] has
[23:23] circled the world
[23:25] amen amen let us read our scripture uh
[23:29] this evening
[23:30] um Philippians chapter four we just like
[23:33] to say how much we've appreciated it's I
[23:36] know it's it's the kind of a whirlwind
[23:38] short trip but uh sometimes that's the
[23:42] way that you have to do it but I've I've
[23:45] felt welcome since I've been here and uh
[23:48] like I say I salute uh brother Samuel
[23:52] Dale for uh all of the efforts that
[23:54] those uh Elders put forth to make it
[23:58] easy so that we could begin to even
[24:01] understand what we had and what what we
[24:03] we were preaching I remember when I
[24:07] first started preaching uh uh I didn't
[24:11] really know what I was preaching didn't
[24:13] really have a grasp and and then God
[24:16] threw me in the deep and say now you're
[24:18] going to take this church over and I'm
[24:20] like huh
[24:22] you got to be kidding me no it's no joke
[24:25] you got to do it and and uh so by the
[24:29] grace of God it was it was a blessing
[24:31] that we had the opportunity to uh by way
[24:35] of of uh medium to just come across
[24:39] Great Men of God that had already uh had
[24:43] it kind of broken down so that we could
[24:45] halfway understand it and then the rest
[24:47] God had to just kind of Quicken it
[24:51] to us and so uh my hat's off to them and
[24:55] I appreciate him uh very much for his
[24:59] his just his effort and his stand in
[25:02] this area I know that it was not easy
[25:06] with my little portion that I've been
[25:08] able to do I know it hasn't been easy so
[25:12] them coming up during a time where it
[25:14] wasn't broken down we didn't have mp3s
[25:17] and we didn't have all of this you know
[25:19] Brothers used to come to the poor pit
[25:21] with a stack of quote books like this
[25:24] see uh I'll call that the tail end of
[25:28] those area those errors but we thank God
[25:31] for him and for his his wife he never
[25:35] could have done it by himself we thank
[25:38] God for her right we we like to salute
[25:42] the men of God but also without the
[25:44] women of God you know by that side
[25:47] giving them strength you know uh behind
[25:50] the scenes uh
[25:53] they wouldn't be able to do what they do
[25:55] so we appreciate the Lord also brother
[25:58] Dale's wife where she's at brother Dale
[26:01] okay there she go so we we we appreciate
[26:05] y'all so standing in standing in the gap
[26:09] amen and that just goes for every
[26:13] Minister that just goes for all of us we
[26:15] we what are we without our wives amen
[26:18] okay let us let us read the scripture
[26:20] and uh we'll we'll just kind of get
[26:23] started and just see how the Lord will
[26:26] lead us uh the 18th verse you said but I
[26:29] have all and abound and I am full having
[26:32] received of I'm not going to try to
[26:35] pronounce that the things which were
[26:37] sent from you and odor of a sweet smell
[26:42] a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to
[26:45] God but my God shall supply all of your
[26:49] needs according to riches and glory and
[26:51] by Christ Jesus gracious father we just
[26:53] thank you we praise your God this
[26:55] evening we just trust that you'll just
[26:57] have your way in the service of God this
[26:59] evening we thank you for all things in
[27:01] Jesus name amen amen
[27:03] you may be seated uh we like we say
[27:06] we're using it as a topic uh the purpose
[27:09] of the crushing in this morning we were
[27:13] just trying to draw a background and
[27:15] just help us to understand that you know
[27:18] we we serve a sovereign God and and
[27:22] you know when you could understand the
[27:26] purposes and the whys this it's like you
[27:29] know driving a car you know we we have
[27:32] things in it and to the carnal mind you
[27:35] might why why is all this in there
[27:38] well it's the thing that's needed it's
[27:41] the things that's necessary to be able
[27:43] to get that thing down the road
[27:45] right amen no matter how pretty it
[27:48] pretty it is if you don't have no matter
[27:50] if you got electrical carb you got a gas
[27:52] car without the batteries and electrical
[27:55] that thing ain't moving it look nice in
[27:57] your yard
[27:58] you've been shining and you can polish
[28:00] it all you want to you know but but you
[28:03] gotta you gotta have some batteries so
[28:05] you gotta have some some gas and things
[28:07] of that nature something the power so so
[28:10] you have to keep those different things
[28:13] in mind you just don't want to we just
[28:16] don't want to be like the carnal world
[28:17] today and and you know people have their
[28:21] own opinions about things well this
[28:23] ain't necessary and that ain't necessary
[28:26] and and you know God this and God that
[28:29] see for me it's easy for me I feel like
[28:34] the anything that God does God did it
[28:37] because it was necessary it had to be
[28:41] done
[28:42] I like to say that again
[28:46] it had to be done and it had to be done
[28:50] the way that it was done
[28:53] right amen I mean when we think about
[28:57] when we think about you know the fall
[28:59] and sin coming into existence you know
[29:03] it it wasn't by chance that you know uh
[29:07] God will Veil himself come down
[29:10] a price had to be paid but the the
[29:14] cruelty
[29:16] right of sin and the price that had to
[29:20] be paid and him having to go through
[29:23] through capital punishment
[29:26] right but if if you look back at at the
[29:30] picture when when when Adam got the
[29:34] Revelation or not Adam oh God y'all got
[29:37] y'all gave me food
[29:42] gave me food
[29:46] able when Abel my mind
[29:52] food is sleep don't work good
[29:55] but but able when able got the
[29:59] revelation of what was what was
[30:01] necessary or what was needed by God
[30:04] right he he he dragged he dragged a a
[30:08] lamb and you know it wasn't pretty
[30:12] you know I don't know if we would have
[30:15] made it you're right so folk cause we
[30:18] like pretty things Kane Kane brought
[30:21] something that was beautiful something
[30:22] that he cultivated within himself
[30:25] something that you know in today's
[30:28] society you know people like nice stuff
[30:31] and you know Kane came out there man got
[30:35] the lamb and he went to just power
[30:38] just hitting it right blood blood
[30:42] everywhere but he needed something that
[30:44] he could identify himself with right
[30:47] and so so you know Christ could not have
[30:51] come
[30:52] and had an easy a easy death if the
[30:56] representation
[30:58] of Christ died under
[31:02] that was cruel
[31:03] come on yeah cause let's think about it
[31:07] if somebody held you down to start
[31:08] hitting you with a rock
[31:11] you'll be laying there like
[31:13] hey that's cruel buddy
[31:15] that that hurts and I'm bleeding yeah
[31:19] you know but the lamb the lamb uh uh uh
[31:23] sacrificed himself for you or not it
[31:26] wasn't a pretty picture
[31:28] right it wasn't you know when Eastern
[31:32] time come you see pink bunny rabbits and
[31:34] you see all of this and it's like y'all
[31:36] don't get it
[31:38] y'all really don't get it it was nothing
[31:41] nice Calvary wasn't nothing nice about
[31:43] Calvary
[31:44] to be drugged there you know you gotta
[31:48] cross you you'd have been beat you you
[31:51] and let let's let's say this all of that
[31:55] was necessary for the program of God and
[32:00] see here's what I like about it as as
[32:03] gruesome as it was it benefited me now I
[32:07] don't know about y'all
[32:09] I don't know what it done for y'all but
[32:12] I benefited from the cruelty God God
[32:17] allowed himself to go through that
[32:20] right because the price had to be paid
[32:24] I like that right it wasn't nothing nice
[32:28] you know thank God that you know he
[32:31] didn't choose me fellas because we
[32:33] wouldn't have been redeemed
[32:36] you know it was difficult so much that I
[32:40] mean let's let's be realistic Jesus with
[32:42] the Gethsemane and he was like what is
[32:45] there any way I could get out of this
[32:47] right right just just having an a
[32:51] knowledge of what he had to go through
[32:53] because let's let's face it your flesh
[32:56] don't want to hurt no
[32:58] no your flesh don't want to die
[33:01] is that right when the when the man of
[33:03] God is preaching the word of God trying
[33:05] to bring this subject to the word it
[33:08] don't want to die it don't want to give
[33:11] up it don't want to give in it just kind
[33:13] of want to have its way yeah you know
[33:16] and so that's why we look funny at the
[33:18] preacher when they preaching
[33:21] and we don't hardly give them a man
[33:23] sometime if right because you know it's
[33:28] it's something cutting and there's
[33:29] things in our lives that that we want to
[33:32] do you know and but God's like no that
[33:36] ain't gonna get you get you where you
[33:38] want to go is right
[33:41] see and so you you kind of got a doubt
[33:44] of that
[33:45] right amen but you know when I look at
[33:48] Calvary
[33:50] uh and it in the picture of Calvary it
[33:52] wasn't nothing easy but it it was it was
[33:57] necessary
[33:59] it was necessary right and and we
[34:04] benefit because of it right I might
[34:08] maybe want to read us a little quote uh
[34:12] as we kind of get started y'all all
[34:14] right
[34:16] uh quote from I know 1960
[34:20] and uh
[34:23] we want to start maybe somewhere around
[34:25] the 74th or 75th verse maybe the 75th
[34:30] verse it says see it it takes a
[34:34] crucifixion
[34:35] right
[34:37] amen uh we think that Christianity is
[34:41] just this
[34:42] you know nice something hey somebody
[34:45] should have told me I thank God for it
[34:47] now when I first became a Christian I
[34:49] didn't I didn't know what was going to
[34:51] take place you know I was just like
[34:53] praise the Lord I'm glad I'm saved
[34:56] right but then I started realizing yeah
[34:59] you say But You Gotta Die there's a
[35:02] there's across the bear
[35:04] right
[35:05] amen he said it takes a crucifixion it
[35:09] takes a crushing of a flower
[35:12] right to bring the perfume from it yeah
[35:16] it takes a crushing of a life
[35:20] I like this part to get the best out of
[35:22] it
[35:27] was kind of preluding to some of the
[35:30] things that I want to say it
[35:32] I now you know more than ever I
[35:35] understand why God allows and I've I've
[35:38] been going through a lot of things the
[35:39] last five years right but I realized
[35:43] that
[35:44] God saw that it was so important
[35:48] to just crush me yeah
[35:56] I realize I got a greater understanding
[35:59] now right right it's like God crushing
[36:03] me realizing that there was more there
[36:08] that he wanted to kind of get out
[36:11] of me
[36:13] to make a better make me a better
[36:16] version
[36:17] of my previous self
[36:21] and and that was the only setup that
[36:25] only provided way in order to get out of
[36:28] us
[36:29] what's in US
[36:32] is that right
[36:35] amen God purpose that yeah right to to
[36:40] crush
[36:41] right that's just God's method yeah
[36:44] right and sometimes we don't like it
[36:47] especially modern-day Christianity
[36:50] right we like this this cute religion
[36:53] now yeah
[36:55] if you kind of look at the nominal World
[36:57] they got this real cute religion with
[37:00] cute Sands you know a modernistic uh
[37:06] easteristic if I could use that term
[37:08] type of Christianity of beautiful
[37:12] flowers and and and uh you know praise
[37:16] and everything is nice and and nothing
[37:20] is crushing nothing is cutting
[37:24] right but everything is nice
[37:27] right but I don't want that because that
[37:31] that won't bring out the the realness
[37:35] right the fullness of Christ
[37:38] right amen it it takes it takes a
[37:42] crushing amen
[37:44] amen see I was enjoying the brothers
[37:45] Sunday school lesson see it it takes
[37:49] that ideology away so that we we can
[37:52] really understand
[37:54] God's provision and how God uses things
[37:57] right and what God does things so when
[38:01] when God starts to crush us we don't
[38:04] bail out
[38:07] right we we just kind of say Okay God if
[38:10] if you brought me to it you'll bring me
[38:13] through it
[38:15] all right if you're allowing me to be
[38:19] crushed it it has its purpose it's it's
[38:23] for a reason that's something that you
[38:27] know you're trying to get out of me get
[38:29] from me
[38:30] and it just takes this
[38:34] it takes this it took a crushing
[38:39] glory to God Amen see it takes the the
[38:43] crucifixion it takes a crushing of the
[38:46] flower to bring out the perfume
[38:50] no crushing no perfume
[38:53] right glory to God amen amen it's got to
[38:57] be God's provided way you know God has a
[39:00] provided way for a baby to get right
[39:05] we you intellectualize it and okay baby
[39:09] you know when you need something put
[39:13] this little bell up here
[39:15] baby like I gotta bail for y'all right
[39:18] you go here too
[39:20] it's gonna be loud and long till you get
[39:23] up in here
[39:25] it's kind of you know and I'll say that
[39:29] we we've got to be careful even around
[39:31] the word of God now I don't gotta
[39:33] believe in legalism but I I you know I I
[39:36] still believe that you gotta come God's
[39:38] provided wait also right
[39:41] so if God sees this it's necessary
[39:44] uh uh it's necessary
[39:48] amen who starts supersedes the thoughts
[39:52] of God
[39:53] who who did God consider when he was
[39:57] putting his plan in program
[39:59] amen uh into order if I could use that
[40:03] term right
[40:06] glory to God I he definitely didn't want
[40:09] my opinion
[40:11] because I would have been like whatever
[40:13] you do you could crush them don't crush
[40:15] me
[40:18] I don't want to go through anything
[40:20] right but it don't it don't work like
[40:23] that it don't work like that amen glory
[40:27] and I'm and I'm grateful for that more
[40:30] so now than than ever you know as we're
[40:34] we're nearing the coming of the Lord and
[40:37] and we're trying God is is trying to get
[40:39] us you know and and Rapture and
[40:43] condition
[40:45] um I believe he got the crutches a
[40:47] little bit more
[40:49] you gotta crush this it's still so much
[40:52] that I think that you know we we're
[40:54] converted but we're still things that
[40:57] we're holding on too
[41:00] glory to his wonderful day
[41:03] I'm guilty too
[41:05] I'm not one of those types of preachers
[41:07] because I I got a suit and a tie but I'm
[41:10] a human being yeah right and that's
[41:12] human elements and and the world is
[41:15] sticky
[41:17] right right and and we all in a contest
[41:21] right and the devil's trying to pull all
[41:23] of us so it's it's I'm in a battle every
[41:27] preacher could say he's in in a battle
[41:29] my battle may not be brother Dale's
[41:31] battle but I'm quite sure he's got a
[41:33] battle as if it's as long as he's a
[41:36] human being now if he's a robot or
[41:38] something maybe he may not have the same
[41:39] battle
[41:40] battles but I'm quite sure he's Flesh
[41:43] and Blood right
[41:44] oh hallelujahs so he says it takes a
[41:48] question of a life to to get the best
[41:51] out of that there is he says that's the
[41:55] reason Jesus had to be crushed
[41:58] to bring forth what he was
[42:02] and we cannot stop right there
[42:05] is to bring out what we are as Sons and
[42:09] Daughters of God we got to go through
[42:11] this crushing the crushing of a life
[42:15] right the question of not just your dad
[42:18] the young people too amen right you got
[42:22] to be kind of crushed see it takes a
[42:24] crushing of a life to get the best that
[42:27] it is that's the reason Jesus had to be
[42:29] crushed to bring forth what he was he
[42:32] could not stand before the crucifixion
[42:36] and say all power in Heaven and Earth is
[42:39] given up into my hand but after the
[42:42] crucifixion so you see how necessary
[42:45] that was right he couldn't stand and say
[42:48] our power and Heaven ever is given uh to
[42:52] my hand but what he did do it taken a
[42:55] crucifixion first it taken the crushing
[42:59] right it it see that it took that that's
[43:04] that that's what it it takes
[43:07] right let's let's look at a a a quote
[43:11] from the cruelty of sin 1953.
[43:15] I think it's starting at verse 8.
[43:19] um brother brother Branham
[43:21] uh and one of the things we know Sin is
[43:25] Sin is crew yeah we we can see this this
[43:30] is a true age that we living in we we're
[43:34] seeing things that uh we did not see
[43:38] years ago
[43:40] now I I I'm reminded and you know
[43:44] people a little bit older than me talk
[43:47] about they used to could leave their
[43:49] doors opening go to the market and stuff
[43:52] like that and you only have to really
[43:54] worry about nobody coming into your
[43:55] dwelling right right
[43:57] you can't do that now
[44:00] I locked my doors I lock my car doors in
[44:04] my yard
[44:05] and I live on an acre why you knocking
[44:08] your doors because people have no
[44:10] respect it used to be a time where
[44:13] people would need you and you have to
[44:15] worry about a person coming up in here
[44:17] and but because there was a reverence
[44:20] for for ministers there was a reverence
[44:22] for churches now
[44:24] reverence for nobody
[44:26] right
[44:28] amen but we thank God that Jesus Christ
[44:31] you know went to carry he says uh God
[44:35] made every individual here go home
[44:38] tonight with this on their mind thinking
[44:41] of what a sacrifice
[44:45] we that's I think that's with that
[44:47] statement we we should always think
[44:49] about what a sacrifice was made for me
[44:55] because it's an individual thing right
[44:58] what did it cost to redeem yeah
[45:03] right
[45:05] and pay the price
[45:07] right I needed redeeming but I couldn't
[45:10] pay the price
[45:12] and to think about what he went through
[45:16] I benefit from that's what I like
[45:22] what what as cruel as it might have seen
[45:26] Capital uh Roman capital punishment
[45:30] right I benefited from that I'm able to
[45:34] stand here tonight because of that
[45:38] right could could you imagine think
[45:41] about it if that hadn't out of happened
[45:46] how could we ever begin to talk about a
[45:50] man Redemption
[45:52] I mean we saw different things under the
[45:54] shadow
[45:55] right right but we we needed a real
[45:59] reality to those things
[46:01] is that right even John on the island
[46:04] Patton would say who who is Worthy
[46:07] that could move he started weeping
[46:12] right
[46:13] but but thank God Amen God had
[46:16] Provisions yeah
[46:19] yeah right so that so that we could
[46:21] benefit from those things
[46:24] because of those things let me tell you
[46:27] something I'm grateful for that amen
[46:30] tonight
[46:32] being an ex drug abuser y'all don't
[46:35] really know how how much I appreciate
[46:40] what he did for me
[46:43] is that right and and his leadership to
[46:49] bring me a man to this amen present-day
[46:53] life
[46:55] come on church now I'm up here preaching
[46:58] and you know but man when I read quotes
[47:01] like that I really know because I'm
[47:04] really no real real bondage
[47:07] see if you've never been on crack and
[47:10] all of that
[47:12] you you might know a little bondage but
[47:14] let me tell you something when those
[47:16] things get you heroin and crack cocaine
[47:19] and all of that stuff brother let me
[47:21] tell you something that's real bondage
[47:24] alcohol and you know all sorts of
[47:27] perversion is that those are real real
[47:29] real bondages man that you need a real
[47:32] real real delivery
[47:38] and then let me tell you something I
[47:40] look back 35 years
[47:42] right I got I you know I know I would
[47:46] say it in the mind of God but 35 years
[47:48] ago I recognized who I was you know uh I
[47:53] always in the mind of God but I came to
[47:56] and a birth took place right
[48:00] and now I could see the word let me tell
[48:03] you something I don't I don't take these
[48:06] things for granted right I don't take
[48:08] these things lightly I really appreciate
[48:11] it appreciate these things right amen
[48:14] amen glory to God
[48:18] he he says what what a sacrifice
[48:21] what it calls to redeem
[48:25] what did it cost God yeah
[48:28] yeah right it it costs it costs God the
[48:33] greatest Price
[48:34] it caused Christ his life
[48:37] amen right
[48:39] man he was the rose of Sharon but to get
[48:43] the perfume out of the Rose you have to
[48:46] crush it up
[48:48] right his beautiful life was crushed
[48:52] a young man 31 and a half
[48:55] 33 and a half right that we watch this
[48:59] next statement that we might live
[49:04] you don't really know life until you
[49:07] convert it
[49:10] you know you don't you don't really you
[49:14] can't really comprehend what real life
[49:17] is until you convert it
[49:19] you know like I say yeah I was 15 before
[49:22] 16 and young and in church I thought man
[49:26] that's just for old folk I got time and
[49:28] you know I felt like all of that but
[49:30] then as you know you start getting older
[49:34] you realize ain't no age limit to it
[49:36] that I'm gonna tell you something the
[49:39] earlier the better
[49:42] yeah even the prophet makes statements
[49:45] like that he wish he would have got and
[49:46] he got he got said a relatively young
[49:49] age but you know what I wish I wish
[49:52] something would have really struck me at
[49:55] a really younger age where I didn't go
[49:59] out and and Scar my life
[50:03] right
[50:04] by the world I didn't score it all up
[50:07] and and I still have to live even though
[50:11] I'm converted and God don't remember

[1:04:55] You gotta be responsible and that's why
[1:04:59] you got to be crushed and that's why I
[1:05:01] enjoyed the the testimony this morning
[1:05:04] right
[1:05:06] oh my I like that I'm having a good time
[1:05:10] amen he said but let's get back to it he
[1:05:13] says I I feel good look Jesus he was the
[1:05:16] rose of Sharon he was offered to God as
[1:05:19] a sweet smelling savor
[1:05:22] and and then when he become then when we
[1:05:26] become unbearable for God what US
[1:05:33] I'm going on cause y'all gonna say
[1:05:35] that's the tyrant
[1:05:37] that's the tyrant
[1:05:40] cause sometimes we do we we become
[1:05:43] unbearable before god let's think about
[1:05:46] brother Branham and and you know his his
[1:05:51] mindset when he walked into that
[1:05:54] restaurant that day
[1:05:56] and he saw he saw he saw this this old
[1:06:00] woman and the police and and just the
[1:06:03] the scenery and just look at his
[1:06:06] attitude yeah
[1:06:07] yeah you know he he like almost like
[1:06:10] Lord bring Jasmine down on this guy like
[1:06:13] whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait
[1:06:15] a minute wait a minute wait a minute I
[1:06:17] think you need to go through some more
[1:06:19] yeah
[1:06:20] yeah right come on come over here let me
[1:06:22] talk to you a minute
[1:06:23] right let me let me let me give you a
[1:06:27] real View
[1:06:29] right of of you yourself we talk about a
[1:06:32] A God Called Prophet
[1:06:35] right but but he needed a little crush
[1:06:38] and we know he got a crushing at the
[1:06:41] early part of his ministry
[1:06:43] right and that let me that that was
[1:06:46] heartbreaking right
[1:06:48] to lose to lose as a young man your wife
[1:06:52] and and your daughter
[1:06:55] that that will
[1:06:58] I don't know if I could have handled
[1:07:00] that I don't I don't know how many men
[1:07:02] that would have been strong enough to
[1:07:04] handle that you lose your wife and your
[1:07:06] baby and almost lose you baby boy you
[1:07:10] you know because of disobedience
[1:07:14] right right because her her daddy
[1:07:18] right got in the way of what God's will
[1:07:21] was for your life
[1:07:23] and God just had to show you who was
[1:07:25] boss
[1:07:26] I'm bigger than you I'm bigger than your
[1:07:28] father-in-law now
[1:07:31] you know I have ordained you you were
[1:07:34] born for such a time as this
[1:07:37] amen you was born to fulfill scriptural
[1:07:40] purpose that will be fulfilled
[1:07:45] right
[1:07:47] right amen you know I I think it was a
[1:07:51] lot more to it than even that because
[1:07:53] brother Branham said watching his little
[1:07:57] Sharon Rose suffer the way that she
[1:07:59] suffered
[1:08:01] right he said every time cross-eyed
[1:08:05] children would get in the prayer line
[1:08:08] they've been why
[1:08:11] I like this
[1:08:13] the sovereignty of God
[1:08:16] see we could we we look at brother
[1:08:18] Branham and and and and all things work
[1:08:21] together for the good
[1:08:23] right yeah
[1:08:25] it might not be good
[1:08:28] but but
[1:08:30] God's plan
[1:08:31] that's right God's purpose right amen
[1:08:35] glory to God God allowed that to happen
[1:08:39] right God God allowed that to happen for
[1:08:43] the purpose
[1:08:45] knowing that there would be so many
[1:08:48] cross-sided children see we see this
[1:08:52] part but this part mattered to God too
[1:08:55] yeah glory to God this part mattered to
[1:08:59] God by the time by the time where
[1:09:01] brother random thought I'm paraphrasing
[1:09:04] talking about you know praying for this
[1:09:06] and you know different people and
[1:09:08] different things and and God sent the uh
[1:09:12] a mother possum to him
[1:09:17] right yeah
[1:09:19] God was concerned
[1:09:24] come on right yes when Humanity probably
[1:09:26] want to just take the gun because I know
[1:09:28] if that was me
[1:09:30] In the Flesh and no leading I thought it
[1:09:34] was just random house got a gun just
[1:09:36] boom
[1:09:37] right
[1:09:39] absolutely but God
[1:09:42] was concerned
[1:09:46] right about that mother possum yeah God
[1:09:49] was amen not that Humanity was
[1:09:52] right but God was God said I got a man
[1:09:55] on the Earth
[1:09:58] go to him he'll get you he he'll get you
[1:10:01] what's needed
[1:10:03] right right
[1:10:04] I've crushed him enough
[1:10:08] right yeah yeah in him is is
[1:10:11] ability to pray right he'll get you on
[1:10:15] your feet
[1:10:16] right glory to God right so it's
[1:10:19] necessary
[1:10:22] see what was in Jesus Christ I need it
[1:10:26] yeah yeah man
[1:10:28] I need it I need it blunt right right
[1:10:34] I need healing because you can't preach
[1:10:36] one without the other you can't believe
[1:10:38] Redemption without healing
[1:10:43] and I heard him talk about sick people
[1:10:47] right so that was needed God knew that
[1:10:49] which is Stripes right
[1:10:53] man oh that was cruel it was
[1:10:57] yeah you know what sometimes you know
[1:10:59] thinking about what people go through
[1:11:02] things aren't always nice
[1:11:06] right that we go through
[1:11:09] right but it's so necessary sometimes
[1:11:12] for us to go through that to experience
[1:11:15] these things
[1:11:17] glory to God
[1:11:19] see I could talk about things that if if
[1:11:24] you never was on drugs you can't really
[1:11:26] talk about
[1:11:27] it see you can't really really
[1:11:30] intellectually maybe if you study enough
[1:11:33] books or something well I don't have to
[1:11:36] study books
[1:11:37] to talk to you about you know drug
[1:11:40] addictions and gang violence and all
[1:11:43] that I don't have to talk to you about
[1:11:45] from book knowledge I could talk from
[1:11:48] personal experience right right
[1:11:52] and and we're living in an age now of
[1:11:55] gang culture more so than it's ever been
[1:11:59] right
[1:12:01] and the influence and the impact yeah
[1:12:06] right
[1:12:07] and these things got to be preached
[1:12:09] around the revealed word
[1:12:12] because there's a constant tug and pull
[1:12:15] on our Young Generation
[1:12:18] I mean you know this this like I said
[1:12:21] earlier
[1:12:23] this this building shouldn't be able to
[1:12:26] hold uh
[1:12:28] bye
[1:12:30] the amount of people that's probably
[1:12:32] come in and out in the families and
[1:12:35] their children and you know sometimes
[1:12:37] their children's children I think back
[1:12:39] you know coming up and and and and you
[1:12:43] know in the different churches the
[1:12:45] churches that I pastored and the
[1:12:46] churches are more part of the amount of
[1:12:49] people that have come in the doors and
[1:12:51] sat for a season and and and all of that
[1:12:55] if if they were there and their families
[1:12:57] and their children and their children
[1:12:59] and children my God we'd have to build
[1:13:01] big buildings
[1:13:03] but I guess the scriptures say fear not
[1:13:05] little flock
[1:13:07] and so you just have to appreciate being
[1:13:11] a Christian amen
[1:13:14] hey you gotta appreciate you gotta pre
[1:13:18] really appreciate having uh servants
[1:13:22] like you know uh I've met today and that
[1:13:26] I've known you you can't take that for
[1:13:28] granted no
[1:13:29] no right
[1:13:31] uh that's not that's not skim milk to
[1:13:33] have somebody
[1:13:35] who who
[1:13:37] is willing to put themselves on the line
[1:13:42] right right
[1:13:43] and Pastor in the church for 23 years I
[1:13:46] think just about everybody in the
[1:13:48] building talked about me
[1:13:51] in a negative life
[1:13:53] and all I was ever trying to do was to
[1:13:55] point them to Jesus Christ
[1:13:57] better smile I need to talk to you okay
[1:14:01] I I just talked about you and I just
[1:14:10] they're not gonna fully tell you what
[1:14:12] everything they said
[1:14:14] but they just gonna tell you just enough
[1:14:16] I totally and then they break down and
[1:14:19] crying and all that and and I'm a man
[1:14:23] I'm a human being you know you have to
[1:14:26] you have to say sister brother you know
[1:14:29] I forgive you
[1:14:31] you know and come out the next service
[1:14:34] and still preach Christ to him and and
[1:14:38] not be offended
[1:14:40] not holding it animosity uh nothing
[1:14:44] nothing of that nature cause you got to
[1:14:46] realize they were anointed by the devil
[1:14:50] to give you a try that's right to crush
[1:14:52] you
[1:14:54] to make you to make you that much more
[1:14:57] dependent upon him
[1:14:59] all right bro right glory to God I was
[1:15:03] telling him when I was when I was
[1:15:05] preaching this message at home you know
[1:15:07] uh and I probably get to the quote here
[1:15:10] but I just kind of get it out there you
[1:15:13] know he was the lily of the valley
[1:15:16] and and from that and from that Lily
[1:15:19] when it's crushed we get opium
[1:15:24] right we get opium
[1:15:27] opium
[1:15:32] is is for
[1:15:35] uh soothing yeah
[1:15:38] yeah I don't know about y'all but
[1:15:40] I think I I wouldn't be here this this
[1:15:43] this afternoon if it wasn't for the
[1:15:45] opium
[1:15:47] come on
[1:15:50] something something that'll give me a
[1:15:53] piece
[1:15:54] that are quiet
[1:15:58] right that something that that that
[1:16:00] quiets my spirit when it just seemed
[1:16:03] like you know my world is falling apart
[1:16:07] and I don't have the answers to the
[1:16:10] questions right
[1:16:12] it just this this something that I
[1:16:16] because of Calvary that that's been
[1:16:18] given that I benefit
[1:16:22] right I benefit from it
[1:16:25] see this this opium it keeps me
[1:16:30] llow it keeps me from like Ping
[1:16:36] you know it just keeps me even kill
[1:16:40] even kill no I try to I try to be yeah
[1:16:44] every now and then I get a little riled
[1:16:46] up but then he comes in to keep me
[1:16:48] settled
[1:16:50] especially especially you know all of us
[1:16:53] because we rub elbows with the world
[1:16:56] most of us still in the workforce and we
[1:17:00] dealing with bosses and and and just
[1:17:03] people who aren't converting and things
[1:17:05] of that name you need something that'll
[1:17:07] give you a peace when you come home
[1:17:09] when you want something that settles you
[1:17:12] when you clock out and you sit in your
[1:17:14] car and you take a deep breath and say
[1:17:18] boy I'm glad the mate I was over
[1:17:22] something that'll give you a piece that
[1:17:25] when you get to the door of your house
[1:17:27] you don't explode on your wife when she
[1:17:31] say hey honey yeah
[1:17:35] and you know come on somebody

[1:17:46] kids screaming and hollering
[1:17:48] and you like yeah
[1:17:51] yeah

[1:17:58] steps
[1:18:00] right and that was good when they was
[1:18:02] out but when they was home
[1:18:04] they were everywhere
[1:18:07] into everything
[1:18:08] but they were screaming and that was
[1:18:10] hollering and that was having a good
[1:18:12] time but Daddy just got off work
[1:18:16] work hard construction is hard yeah
[1:18:20] yeah
[1:18:21] construction is hard on the body
[1:18:23] especially the older you get
[1:18:25] and then not only that Daddy got a
[1:18:28] church
[1:18:30] and people be calling you
[1:18:32] and you got to study and they Holland
[1:18:35] they don't care
[1:18:39] because they're kids
[1:18:41] and you just can't always say out
[1:18:43] and shut up
[1:18:46] you gotta let them be kids
[1:18:48] you gotta let them unwind yeah
[1:18:52] this might be helping somebody who ain't

[1:20:40] person on a personal note right amen
[1:20:43] right I thank God

[1:20:50] express more of the god that's in me
[1:20:54] right amen amen
[1:20:58] his character's a victory yeah
[1:21:01] you got to go through some stuff see
[1:21:04] amen and listen others others benefit
[1:21:09] right
[1:21:11] but what we've gone through
[1:21:14] see I benefit by by what brother uh Dale
[1:21:19] and and those other ministers Mike all
[1:21:23] Teague and some of those those guys you
[1:21:26] know the fights that they had right
[1:21:29] Glory somebody had to do it
[1:21:33] somebody had to do it
[1:21:36] and God ordained for them to do it
[1:21:40] right and and I benefit from that I
[1:21:44] don't take that for granted yeah
[1:21:47] yeah that's that's a blessing to me
[1:21:50] and and even in my many years of of
[1:21:53] ministering uh you know sometimes I go
[1:21:56] back to the the older ministers right
[1:22:00] and just you know still gleam
[1:22:05] glory to his wonderful name glean from
[1:22:08] the things that that you know
[1:22:13] they might not be spinning around like
[1:22:15] the young guys
[1:22:16] but they have so much to say so much
[1:22:19] wisdom
[1:22:20] you know uh
[1:22:22] I don't I don't too much run the aisles
[1:22:26] anymore and kick and stomp but but out
[1:22:29] of all the years you know God has given
[1:22:32] us something that we could help this
[1:22:35] oncoming generation
[1:22:37] right amen and and we could give to the
[1:22:41] younger ministers coming up
[1:22:43] and help them to see it's it's a lot
[1:22:46] more to it than kicking and stomping and
[1:22:49] getting the people riled up
[1:22:52] you know but but to give them a
[1:22:54] substance right that when they leave the
[1:22:57] church they could ponder over they could
[1:23:00] think about something that that are
[1:23:03] helped in their growth
[1:23:05] right because when you 20 you ain't went
[1:23:08] through much of nothing yeah
[1:23:11] I just have to say it like that uh but
[1:23:15] by the time you get 40 and 60 right you
[1:23:18] got really got something to say right
[1:23:21] right because you you don't went through
[1:23:23] a whole a whole lot of a whole lot of
[1:23:26] stuff
[1:23:27] like like the brother who was saying

[1:26:05] like me when I got married I just wanted
[1:26:08] to be married
[1:26:10] God gave me a wonderful uh sister in the
[1:26:15] message and you know and I was yeah but
[1:26:18] I didn't have a clue
[1:26:21] because I didn't have I had a daddy but
[1:26:24] he wasn't much because he didn't have a
[1:26:26] vision for my mama
[1:26:28] and then she you know all of the the
[1:26:31] stepdads I had they didn't have a vision
[1:26:33] they couldn't tell me nothing
[1:26:36] so so so I I walked into those things
[1:26:40] blindly
[1:26:42] right and you know for me I don't want
[1:26:46] for a younger generation of men young
[1:26:48] Christian men to do that
[1:26:53] always educate yourself keep educating
[1:26:56] yourself amen right yeah
[1:26:59] every year try to educate yeah that
[1:27:01] that's just you know also it's older
[1:27:03] older guys too we got to continue to
[1:27:06] educate ourselves and have a vision for
[1:27:09] our wives and for our families you know
[1:27:12] uh that nothing falls through the cracks
[1:27:15] I I trust that that was all right

[1:27:34] I learned that as you get older
[1:27:37] you know you don't try to
[1:27:39] because you can't tell it all at one
[1:27:41] time
[1:27:43] it's it's it's just too much
[1:27:46] it's constantly be unfolding but we we
[1:27:50] trust that we were able to express a
[1:27:53] little something that was on our heart
[1:27:55] and that that
[1:27:57] um you just take your portion
[1:28:00] from what was said and and you ponder it

[1:30:25] tonight we just thank you for all things
[1:30:27] in Jesus name amen amen
[1:30:32] [Applause]
[1:30:40] amen
[1:30:43] it's good when you come to church and
[1:30:44] you hear the word of God and you get
[1:30:45] some life lessons to go with it because
[1:30:47] you know what we're Christians but we
[1:30:48] got life
[1:30:50] what's the old saying life happens
[1:30:52] yeah but when you get eternal life that
[1:30:55] life happens happens a little bit
[1:30:56] different let's let's give our brother
[1:30:59] another good hand
[1:31:05] you know as we were we're speaking on
[1:31:08] the Statue of perfect man he and I were
[1:31:10] we were talking about it
[1:31:12] that takes a crushing too
[1:31:14] it takes a crushing it takes a crushing
[1:31:17] all the time to crush us out so that
[1:31:19] Christ can live in squeeze us I mean
[1:31:23] Ring us out
[1:31:25] and that's why a good preaching when you
[1:31:27] when when you hear good preaching it it
[1:31:29] it should release you and it should take
[1:31:31] some of the burden off of you and it
[1:31:33] should help you to tomorrow on Monday to
[1:31:36] uh to to go to work or to live your life
[1:31:39] just a little bit different because you
[1:31:42] know old Diablo he's going to be here
[1:31:43] you know he's the devil's going to be
[1:31:45] around
[1:31:46] but you don't have to you don't have to
[1:31:48] do what he says right you don't have to
[1:31:50] do what he says there's no way he can
[1:31:53] make you do what he tells you to do you
[1:31:56] have to do it willingly so we'll just
[1:31:58] resist the devil and he'll flee from us
[1:32:01] and we appreciate our brother and let's
[1:32:04] let's sing a song if anybody has a need
[1:32:06] or anything else let's think of a couple
[1:32:08] of verses and then we've gotta get him
[1:32:11] to Atlanta to get on a plane so let's
[1:32:13] sing a song Let's worship just for a
[1:32:15] little bit
[1:32:17] you will survive
[1:32:20] D behind
[1:32:23] us
[1:32:24] [Music]
[1:32:31] protected
[1:32:36] think about it yes he was
[1:32:44] [Music]
[1:32:48] and what do you do he thought of me
[1:32:51] it wasn't for him it was for me and you
[1:32:55] above all sing it to him
[1:32:59] [Music]
[1:33:06] laid behind the
[1:33:09] storms
[1:33:11] you live to die
[1:33:16] rejected and alone
[1:33:20] like a rose
[1:33:23] [Music]
[1:33:31] he did
[1:33:34] and he thought of me and you Jesus
[1:33:37] [Music]
[1:33:43] thank you Lord
[1:33:44] [Music]
[1:33:49] You're the property guy said he said
[1:33:52] don't ask to forget Calvary I know we
[1:33:56] become
[1:33:57] Believers and
[1:34:05] gave us the opportunity to be here
[1:34:09] and give us opportunity to hear the
[1:34:11] message of the hours our brother said
[1:34:13] what greater opportunity
[1:34:17] I know we all have opportunities to do
[1:34:20] better in our life
[1:34:21] but man
[1:34:24] you look out in that world and you see
[1:34:27] they never and some of them are never
[1:34:28] even gonna know
[1:34:30] who Jesus Christ is amen unless you tell
[1:34:34] them about him and if we can't get to
[1:34:36] all of them
[1:34:38] I feel sorry for them all
[1:34:41] that's why we need to tell people about
[1:34:43] Calvary first before we tell them God
[1:34:45] sent a prophet amen God did send himself
[1:34:49] first
[1:34:50] then he sent us a prophet to give us
[1:34:52] Clarity and to give us
[1:34:55] um more Revelation than than the world
[1:34:58] but not without Calvary no without Jesus
[1:35:03] Christ the Bible says you can't even
[1:35:05] know him without the Holy Ghost and now
[1:35:08] we know how to get the Holy Ghost
[1:35:09] because we God sent us a prophet it
[1:35:11] wasn't shouting it wasn't speaking in
[1:35:12] tongues it wasn't shaking the hands my
[1:35:14] brother said it wasn't writing on a book
[1:35:16] or writing on a on a piece of paper no
[1:35:19] it's a birth yes it's something you have
[1:35:23] to die
[1:35:25] to get amen if he had to die to give it
[1:35:28] to you you got to die to get it you got
[1:35:31] to die to yourself and let him crush us
[1:35:33] you think man that's tough but you know
[1:35:35] what a crushing blow
[1:35:38] at the Garden of Eden
[1:35:40] there was Adam he never felt a pain in
[1:35:42] his life
[1:35:45] Eve never felt the pain in the in her
[1:35:48] life never a heartache or a trial
[1:35:52] um
[1:35:53] the Lions could walk through the kitchen
[1:35:55] and right out the back door and no
[1:35:58] problem
[1:35:59] right
[1:36:01] everything was in harmony
[1:36:04] and then all of a sudden
[1:36:06] something happened
[1:36:08] it was a crushing blow to humanity
[1:36:11] but it had to happen
[1:36:13] so that God could come and be crushed
[1:36:15] and give us eternal life please let
[1:36:18] don't ever forget that don't ever forget
[1:36:20] what he did for us
[1:36:23] and the way we show it back
[1:36:26] is we tell people you know brother Brown
[1:36:29] says tell people how you got how you how
[1:36:31] you like got lit well tell them how you
[1:36:33] got crushed
[1:36:34] tell them how God took a piece of clay
[1:36:38] you know you Mary Magdalene when she was
[1:36:42] at the feet of Jesus
[1:36:44] she had a little box
[1:36:46] right
[1:36:48] the song you know about the alabaster
[1:36:51] box amen there was no way that odor
[1:36:54] could have got out
[1:36:56] until she crushed him
[1:37:00] that odor no matter how sweet
[1:37:03] no matter how odorous it was it was
[1:37:06] trapped inside that piece of clay
[1:37:10] until she broke the lid
[1:37:14] and everybody smelled it because Judas
[1:37:16] was complaining about using all of it
[1:37:18] and everybody was smelling it
[1:37:20] only by being crushed
[1:37:23] did people get to smell the odor
[1:37:26] that was in that Alabaster Box sometimes
[1:37:28] he has to do that with us he has to
[1:37:30] crush us
[1:37:31] he has to give us a blow that sometimes
[1:37:33] it maybe you know we're not gonna we
[1:37:35] just don't feel like we're gonna make it
[1:37:37] but we're here
[1:37:39] we gotta fight be brave as the song says
[1:37:42] against all evil
[1:37:45] right and keep moving forward
[1:37:48] keep going on with God if you got issues
[1:37:50] in your life just keep praying keep keep
[1:37:54] doing whatever you need to do to get
[1:37:57] that thing cleared up right we're here
[1:37:59] to help you all we can help you if you
[1:38:01] need help we're here to listen to you to
[1:38:04] you and and you know you you take
[1:38:06] somebody like brother brother Smiley and
[1:38:09] and um and you you just you watch even
[1:38:13] the mannerisms you haven't lost being a
[1:38:15] pastor you know so you you just see the
[1:38:18] mannerisms of how he how he does it so
[1:38:20] much care about your flesh
[1:38:26] he said I ain't worried about your flesh
[1:38:28] I ain't worried about your feelings I'm
[1:38:30] talking to your soul today I'm talking
[1:38:32] to that real person down inside of you

[1:38:36] but what brother they'll always tell us
[1:38:38] what are you tell us to put our feelings
[1:38:41] in our pocket and sit on them
[1:38:45] brother Willie's smiling he's probably
[1:38:46] heard him if he's hurt him enough
[1:38:48] and that's what we need to put our
[1:38:49] feelings and not let our feelings get
[1:38:51] involved but we're human beings and
[1:38:52] guess what we're full of feelings from
[1:38:54] the top of our head to the ball of our
[1:38:55] feet so we've got to what Crush that

[1:40:15] need to do
[1:40:21] your face is red
[1:40:26] we're going to try to do something about
[1:40:28] that but it is kind of rough having to
[1:40:30] if you need to go to be in there and got
[1:40:32] to walk down through here but uh but
[1:40:35] we're just family members we should feel
[1:40:36] comfortable around each other even
[1:40:38] though we came from totally different
[1:40:40] Mamas and totally different daddies
[1:40:41] Earthly we came from one heavenly father
[1:40:44] if you're born again
[1:40:46] and we've got his genetics running
[1:40:48] through our veins now and we we've got
[1:40:50] as brother Brown says we've got his
[1:40:51] potential right as brother Willis said
[1:40:54] he's got him he was broke though so he
[1:40:56] could give us those or he just took them
[1:40:57] all with him
[1:40:58] no he didn't want to do that his whole
[1:41:00] purpose was to have a group of people
[1:41:02] that acted like him
[1:41:04] that's what he wanted a group of people
[1:41:06] that act just like him that's why he
[1:41:08] gave us a statue of perfect man that's
[1:41:09] why he give us three and a half years of
[1:41:10] his life and died and then came back and
[1:41:13] went inside of you not to be with you
[1:41:15] but to be in you amen and then take
[1:41:17] complete control
[1:41:18] of your life and we we're heading toward
[1:41:21] that right amen all mine's clear y'all
[1:41:24] pray for us that there won't be any
[1:41:26] traffic
[1:41:27] and we'll get down to the airport and
[1:41:29] and get him back home to Okeechobee
[1:41:32] Florida ain't nothing down there but a
[1:41:33] big old Lake
[1:41:35] and some fishing
[1:41:37] but we sure want him to come back again
[1:41:38] we don't want it to be uh
[1:41:41] um years and years and him and brother
[1:41:43] Jack both that we just appreciate
[1:41:45] ministers that come in and and
[1:41:47] um and pour the heart out and that's
[1:41:49] what I want that pour the heart out

[1:41:54] women and I were talking you know like
[1:41:56] Dad and different ones the older ones
[1:41:58] it's a it takes a toll that brother
[1:42:00] Brown told us that one sermon was an
[1:42:02] eight equivalent of working eight hours
[1:42:04] think of how many sermons y'all preach
[1:42:07] after your eight hours you worked right
[1:42:09] right you know Dad worked at GM and
[1:42:12] brother Whitley he hanged sheetrock and
[1:42:14] and finishes so he's not just got a desk
[1:42:17] job he works hard thank goodness he's
[1:42:20] taller I told him he didn't need stilts
[1:42:21] to stand on but he said he still did
[1:42:24] wear stilts every once in a while but he
[1:42:25] don't get on him now he said if he
[1:42:27] followed hurt himself that's right so
[1:42:29] they won't let him on stilts anymore so
[1:42:31] uh no more he said no more well it was
[1:42:34] good to have brother brother Smiley with
[1:42:35] us and we appreciate him and just just
[1:42:37] pray for her
[1:42:38] we'll get him back maybe later on in the
[1:42:40] year but just pray for us as we go down

[1:46:05] around the table we'll get to do that
[1:46:07] one day sister cleat and I were talking
[1:46:09] today and she was talking about
[1:46:10] remembering things
[1:46:12] you know the Bible says behold all
[1:46:16] things will be made new the former
[1:46:17] things will pass away thank God see we
[1:46:20] carry that with us and that's the load
[1:46:22] that we carry is the things we did as
[1:46:23] brother Willie was talking about he
[1:46:25] can't deny his life he knows what he was
[1:46:27] at where he was at but one day that's
[1:46:30] all going to be a load gone man that's
[1:46:33] enough to shout about yes sir amen that
[1:46:36] all that's gone I mean we know it's gone
[1:46:38] already in the mind of God but it's gone
[1:46:40] from me and you God will so wash our
[1:46:43] brain till we have nothing but new
[1:46:45] thoughts
[1:46:46] and we remember the good things we'll
[1:46:48] remember we had kids we'll remember that
[1:46:50] we had you know parents and and things
[1:46:53] like that because we can't forget them
[1:46:55] uh brother Brown said you'll know who
[1:46:57] you were married to so so everything's
[1:46:59] not going it's not going to just totally
[1:47:01] blank your mind no you're going to
[1:47:02] remember the good things the time you
[1:47:04] got saved I don't think you'll ever
[1:47:06] forget the time you got saved that's
[1:47:08] right amen I think that's something that
[1:47:10] you'll remember and you'll know it
[1:47:11] cherish it and it'll be part of you for
[1:47:14] eternity you'll know the day that you
[1:47:16] got born again
[1:47:17] and I appreciate the Lord for letting us
[1:47:21] keep that part and keep the part of all
[1:47:24] the good things that we have the good
[1:47:25] times we've had together the talks that
[1:47:27] we've had to eat with each other and the
[1:47:29] fellowship to go out and eat or sitting
