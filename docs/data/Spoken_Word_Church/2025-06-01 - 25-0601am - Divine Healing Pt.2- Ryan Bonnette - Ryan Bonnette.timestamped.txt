[0:00] Lord, we thank you for your presence
[0:01] here, Lord. And we thank you for uh
[0:03] being with all those who are away, Lord,
[0:04] brother Bob and family traveling, many
[0:06] others who are away traveling, Lord, be
[0:07] with them. And um and help all the
[0:10] Sunday school classes, Lord, the lesson
[0:11] up here to be a blessing to the adult
[0:13] class. And then um the teenagers
[0:15] downstairs, all the young people, Lord,
[0:16] bless them and the Sunday school lessons
[0:17] there as well. Pray you be with
[0:19] everybody who's still on the way here,
[0:20] Lord. Keep them safe traveling and thank
[0:22] you for taking all the sickness from our
[0:24] midst, Lord. And we love you. Thank you
[0:25] for all your blessings and thank you for
[0:26] helping Brother Way ministering for us
[0:28] also today in Jesus name.
[0:31] Amen. All right, there it is. Okay, so
[0:34] I'm going to do a little review of my
[0:35] last lesson uh first of all. And that uh
[0:38] last lesson I had been talking about u
[0:40] divine healing kind of stepped aside
[0:42] from my love lesson series for a little
[0:44] while because the Lord laid that on my
[0:45] heart. And so just kind of do a quick
[0:48] overview of what I talked about last
[0:51] time. Brother Ben from the Queen of
[0:53] Sheba
[0:55] uh he said they're all Christians. As
[0:57] long as you believe, that's all right.
[0:59] The minute you begin to think that
[1:00] you're not, that's the time you start
[1:02] sinking right there, that's the time
[1:04] your testimony is negative. Divine
[1:06] healing lasts just as long as your faith
[1:07] lasts with it. Your salvation the same
[1:10] because everything of God is by faith.
[1:13] Nothing of God can be proven by natural.
[1:16] So just remember that. Keep a positive
[1:19] confession. Don't sign for nothing the
[1:21] devil brought. Refuse to have it. Refuse
[1:23] to see it. Okay?
[1:26] Just a few more of those slides. Uh, as
[1:29] I was with Moses, brother Brenham said,
[1:30] "You believe it. It's an impossibility
[1:32] for you not to be healed." Let me repeat
[1:35] that. It's totally impossible for you
[1:38] not to be healed if you believe it. To
[1:40] me, if you didn't have any other
[1:42] scripture or quote to stand on that's
[1:44] firm enough to stand on for anything you
[1:46] need, any promise of God. I'm not sure
[1:49] why this is not taking up the whole
[1:51] screen. And it seems like it's kind of
[1:53] like not really full screen, but can
[1:55] y'all see it in the back? Okay. All
[1:57] right. So far so
[2:00] good. Uh, we come to Christ for
[2:02] salvation. This is just a comment from
[2:04] me. Still having temptations and
[2:06] failures. Keep going. Believing and
[2:09] confessing that you're saved. Likewise,
[2:11] we come to Christ for healing and still
[2:13] have symptoms and bad doctor reports.
[2:15] Keep going. Confessing, believing divine
[2:17] healing takes time. Salvation takes
[2:20] time. Resist the devil and he will flee
[2:22] from you. But not right away. He's
[2:24] persistent. He's perseverant. So we
[2:26] likewise have to be persistent and
[2:30] perseverant. So from perfect faith,
[2:33] we're to have perfect faith in this
[2:35] perfect word and resist Satan. Another
[2:38] very powerful comment from brother
[2:40] Brandham. Keep believing God no matter
[2:42] what happens. Real love produces
[2:44] confidence, trust, and faith that God
[2:47] knows what he's doing and he'll work out
[2:48] the promise in his time.
[2:51] All right, I don't have this in my
[2:53] notes, but if you want to follow along
[2:55] in Hebrews chapter 11, I just thought
[2:58] last minute about reading this passage
[3:00] from uh Hebrews 11:8. If you have your
[3:03] Bible, you're welcome to follow along.
[3:05] By faith, Abraham, when he was called to
[3:08] go out into a place which he should
[3:11] after receive for an inheritance,
[3:12] obeyed, and he went out. And this is a
[3:15] key here, not knowing whether he went.
[3:17] That's going to tie in with my lesson
[3:19] for today. Not knowing whether he went
[3:22] by faith he sojourned in the land of
[3:23] promise as in a strange country dwelling
[3:25] in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the
[3:28] heirs with him of the same promise. For
[3:30] he looked for a city which hath
[3:31] foundations whose builder and maker is
[3:33] God. Through faith also Sarah herself
[3:36] received strength to conceive seed and
[3:38] was delivered of a child when she was
[3:40] past age
[3:41] because he was uh she does faithful who
[3:44] had promised. Therefore spring there
[3:46] even of one and him as good as dead. So
[3:49] many as the stars of the sky and
[3:50] multitude and as the sand which is by
[3:52] the seaside innumerable. Going to skip
[3:54] on down
[3:55] to verse 15. And truly if they had been
[3:59] mindful of that country from which they
[4:01] came out they might have had opportunity
[4:02] to return to have returned. But now they
[4:06] desire a better country that is in
[4:07] heavenly. Wherefore God is not ashamed
[4:09] to be called their God. For he hath
[4:12] prepared for them a city. By faith
[4:14] Abraham when he was tried offered up
[4:15] Isaac and he that had received the
[4:17] promises of offered up his only begotten
[4:19] son of whom it was said that in Isaac
[4:22] shall thy seed be called accounting as
[4:24] he was that God was able to raise him
[4:27] even from the dead from whence also he
[4:31] received him in a figure. Um I was
[4:34] thinking about what brother waited
[4:35] preached on I believe it was Wednesday
[4:36] night. you know, we we're not um we're
[4:39] of that group that's going on, you know,
[4:41] not not to be left behind and not
[4:43] staying behind, going on to the promised
[4:44] land. And that means we need to pray. We
[4:46] need to seek God with all of our heart
[4:48] and keep on going. So, uh this love
[4:52] lesson is uh number 13, uh your love
[4:56] story. That's what this one is about,
[4:57] your love story.
[5:02] So throughout the Bible, God worked in
[5:05] the lives of Bible characters. They
[5:07] lived their normal daily lives like
[5:09] Abraham there, not knowing where they
[5:10] went, not knowing exactly what they were
[5:12] doing, but God was leading them. And
[5:14] he's doing the same to y'all today, to
[5:16] us as the bride. That's my whole point
[5:18] today. They live their normal daily
[5:20] lives not realizing that God was
[5:22] ordering their footsteps, writing the
[5:24] story of their lives as they live them.
[5:26] Making them living examples to reveal
[5:29] part of his character. All this is about
[5:31] the glory of God to reveal his
[5:33] character. Now don't think I don't
[5:35] believe in free choice. I believe in
[5:36] free moral agency. God makes things
[5:38] happen in your life. He puts things in
[5:40] front of you. He leads and guides you.
[5:42] But he knows your choice. So
[5:44] predestination is based on God's
[5:46] fornowledge of your choice of what
[5:48] you'll choose here. So it's his
[5:50] fornowledge that he knew what you would
[5:52] choose. So it goes back to what you
[5:54] decide today. Today is the day of
[5:55] salvation. So don't think I'm saying
[5:57] saying that God is making things happen
[6:00] like forcing you into something. It's
[6:02] just that he knew before all this
[6:04] started what would happen. And he can
[6:06] put the right books, the right people,
[6:09] the right church, the right song, the
[6:11] right prayer, the right thought,
[6:13] whatever he needs to in your path to
[6:14] lead you in the way you go. God orders
[6:18] the footsteps of the elect. We still
[6:20] make a choice.
[6:23] So he still does the same thing today in
[6:25] our lives. That's our love story. So as
[6:27] my my title is here, that's what I'm
[6:29] referring to is your love story, meaning
[6:33] God's redemption to you personally. how
[6:35] he drew you, how he called you, cooed to
[6:37] you even while you were still a
[6:40] sinner. The benefit of seeing your love
[6:42] story is that you will be encouraged
[6:44] realizing your life has not been random,
[6:47] but planned by God.
[6:50] So Jeremiah 29:11, for I know the
[6:52] thoughts that I think toward you, sayith
[6:53] the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of
[6:55] evil, to give you an expected end. I
[6:58] think I taught this lesson up here years
[7:00] ago called the great playwright, maybe a
[7:02] couple years ago. And this is roughly
[7:04] based on that same theme. So if you see
[7:07] any slides repeated, that's I drew a lot
[7:09] from that because it's kind of along
[7:11] that same
[7:12] lines. So you're not having a dja vu if
[7:15] you see any repeats. Many times our love
[7:18] story written by the same author as
[7:21] those in the Bible replicates those in
[7:24] the scripture. So, this is um not always
[7:27] it it won't always be exact, but you
[7:29] know, God can do things that's not
[7:31] written in the Bible, but at the same
[7:32] time, the same God that wrote the Bible
[7:34] can relive those stories in your life.
[7:36] And I love to see that. And I think
[7:38] everybody here has seen that at some
[7:39] point in your life. If you'll meditate,
[7:42] if you'll think about your journey,
[7:43] think about that crazy weird thing that
[7:45] happened that you think when it happens,
[7:47] I've always tried to avoid this thing,
[7:49] Lord, and now it's happening. Why? you
[7:51] know, and you go to meditate on it and
[7:53] you think, well, maybe there's something
[7:54] to that. Think about the bad things even
[7:57] that have happened in your life and you
[7:59] just wonder why. Sometimes just think
[8:01] about all the people, places, things,
[8:03] times, events, and everything involved
[8:04] with it and you'll begin to see this
[8:06] these stories in the Bible repeat. So,
[8:09] here's some examples. There's tons, but
[8:12] kind of just a few examples I put
[8:14] together here. Brother Brandham, this
[8:15] was quoted recently. Um I think a couple
[8:18] preachers recently quoted this story
[8:19] about the Memphis, Tennessee woman that
[8:23] um brother that she said u when you know
[8:25] brother Ben's plane got grounded and he
[8:27] went walking and and uh he found this
[8:29] woman and she said I that type of woman
[8:32] that tsunami type of woman and and then
[8:34] you're the Elijah. Well anyway that was
[8:37] a repeat of a story in the scripture and
[8:39] it relived modern day brother Bam's life
[8:42] stories. Why did he even tell his life
[8:44] stories so much? You know, he told his
[8:46] life story over and over again. And if
[8:48] you go back and and listen, there's so
[8:50] many things that replicate scripture and
[8:52] stories in the Bible. I want to say
[8:54] probably a lot of people have had a Mark
[8:56] 4 trial. You remember Mark chapter 4. I
[8:59] didn't reference it to make sure that's
[9:00] right. I believe that's the place where
[9:02] Jesus was on the boat with the
[9:04] disciples. Sea got stormy. It I believe
[9:08] it was at night and the sea got uh sea
[9:10] got stormy and and he was asleep on a
[9:12] pillow on the back as if he didn't care.
[9:14] and they got afraid. So they went to
[9:16] wake him and said, "Master, carest thou
[9:18] not that we perish?" He rebuked them and
[9:21] then he rebuked the winds and waves. He
[9:22] rebuked them for their unbelief. And how
[9:24] many times have you seen that in your
[9:26] life? Maybe when you're going through a
[9:28] trial and you say, "Lord, don't you care
[9:30] that this is happening? Where are you
[9:31] at? Why are you not here? Why are you
[9:32] not working?" And then he'll come, if
[9:34] you're really paying attention, he'll
[9:36] come in and rebuke you through your
[9:38] daily Bible reading or through a
[9:39] preacher behind the pull pit and say,
[9:41] "No, why didn't you believe me? You knew
[9:43] I was there. you knew I was in control.
[9:45] I was just waiting to see what you would
[9:46] do. And here he comes and he rebukes the
[9:48] winds and the waves. That happened. I've
[9:49] I've testified about me and Gabby with
[9:52] Iva dying at 3 days old. Uh at day
[9:54] number two, I went out of the hospital
[9:56] and said, "Where are you at, Lord?"
[9:57] That's literally what I said. That was
[9:59] me waking him from the pillow in the
[10:00] back of the ship, saying, "Lord, carest
[10:03] thou not that my baby's dying in the in
[10:05] the hospital, but we're going to the B
[10:07] Bible study anyway. We're going to serve
[10:08] you anyway." And then at 2:00 the next
[10:12] morning, Sunday morning, we met that
[10:14] doctor and she said, "Your baby's
[10:16] dying." Right before that, I read 1 John
[10:18] 4 and that was my rebuke. It said, "He
[10:20] who fearth is not made perfect in love."
[10:22] And then the doctor says, "Your baby is
[10:25] stable." She's dying, but you know,
[10:27] right now she's stable. And I later
[10:29] realized that that was my rebuke and me
[10:33] acting out like the disciples, calling
[10:34] out, "Lord, carest thou not. My baby's
[10:36] dying." And then my rebuke in the
[10:38] scripture and then Jesus calmed the wind
[10:40] winds and waves. He said she said uh the
[10:42] doctor said your baby is stable and she
[10:45] never had to have any more the the
[10:48] surgery they were going to do. They
[10:49] didn't have to do it. They didn't do
[10:50] anything different down there. Same
[10:51] medicines. They told me she turned
[10:53] around on her own. That's what they
[10:55] said. That was God taking over the
[10:58] scene. This Mark chapter 4, we relived
[11:00] it. How many of you have relived a
[11:02] Goliath story? You're facing some big
[11:04] giant in your life. It can be lust,
[11:06] temptation, sickness, all kind of
[11:08] Goliaths we face. And then just like
[11:11] David, we take that sling and that faith
[11:14] and we attack that Goliath. You know, so
[11:16] many times we faced a Goliath. Elijah
[11:18] and the widows, Zarapath, I think is how
[11:20] you say it. Uh recently preached here, I
[11:23] don't remember who was talking about
[11:24] that. One of our ministers preaching
[11:25] about that. Elijah and that widow. And I
[11:28] think they told a story of some woman in
[11:31] India who relived this story and didn't
[11:33] even know it was in the Bible. She lived
[11:34] it. Same God working. Even if you don't
[11:37] know that particular story at that
[11:38] particular moment, it's the same God.
[11:41] The same playright
[11:43] now. I'm going to see if I can skip
[11:46] ahead here. I'm not sure exactly how to
[11:48] do this. Hold
[11:50] on. I've had this on. Uh I got to work
[11:54] out. Me and technology got to get along.
[11:56] We don't get along so
[11:58] well cuz I thought I had these in order.
[12:01] The love story applies to each of us.
[12:03] Christ came looking for you his bride
[12:06] through time but he found women flirting
[12:10] with worldly wisdom carnal things uh
[12:13] going to the u to the backside this is
[12:15] the format okay of my of the rest of my
[12:17] lesson basically talking about the story
[12:19] of the armor meat packing boy and what
[12:22] brother uh Manuel called the ranch bride
[12:25] I like that title he gave her the ranch
[12:27] bride and the armor meat packing boy so
[12:29] going to the backside he found those who
[12:32] were willing to take on his mind and
[12:34] character, not swayed by the wisdom of
[12:38] mankind. Okay. So, which group are you
[12:41] that you have to answer that question
[12:42] for yourself? Are you one of these
[12:44] flirty girls that's going to flirt with
[12:46] man's wisdom and knowledge and ideas and
[12:48] be easily swayed from one side to
[12:50] another like pliable, the character in
[12:52] Pilgrim's Progress downstairs. I've been
[12:54] going through Pilgrim's Progress with
[12:56] the teenagers and been talking about
[12:58] pliable. Ironically, when I was talking
[13:00] about pliable and abstinent or abs, I
[13:03] can't remember his name, whatever the
[13:04] name was. Brother Bob was up here that
[13:06] same Sunday talking about that same sort
[13:08] of thing in first Corinthians. And I
[13:10] went back and listened to that. I said,
[13:11] the same time, we're talking about same
[13:12] thing upstairs and downstairs, but which
[13:15] one are you? Are you that pliable one
[13:16] that can be swayed back and forth? Are
[13:18] you the Christian in that pilgrimage
[13:20] progress that's absolutely resolute?
[13:22] You've got your bearing your burden on
[13:24] your back. You're bearing your burden of
[13:25] sin and you're going on anyway. you're
[13:28] absolutely certain that you're going on
[13:29] with the Lord and nothing's going to
[13:30] stop
[13:31] you. Not ready for that slide. Sorry
[13:34] again. The way to see this love story in
[13:38] your life is read the Bible and pray
[13:40] every day. Then meditate on your journey
[13:43] and look for God in your daily life.
[13:45] This is a method. This works. Okay? I've
[13:47] done this for years. I believe firmly in
[13:49] meditation. Set aside some time every
[13:51] day. Read your Bible. That's most
[13:53] important. But then when you're done,
[13:54] take some time and say, "Now, Lord, show
[13:57] me where I'm at in the scripture. Let me
[14:00] think about the events in my life. How
[14:01] did I get in this church? How did I get
[14:03] to the message?" Some of you were raised
[14:04] in the message, but you had to have a
[14:06] backside of the desert experience, too,
[14:08] and stop riding pastor's coattail, mom
[14:10] and daddy's coattail. So, you met God on
[14:12] that backside like the the armor meat
[14:15] packing boy. You met him on the
[14:17] backside. Um, and I came from um, you
[14:20] know, from the Baptist church totally
[14:23] random. I mean, to me it seemed random,
[14:25] you know, I came through into a dating
[14:27] relationship and then, um, got
[14:29] introduced to the message and from then
[14:31] it's been just the Lord just unfolding
[14:33] it to me. Didn't see myself here, you
[14:35] know, never did see myself as being here
[14:38] from the Baptist church. So many of you
[14:40] come from Catholic and all kind of
[14:41] different
[14:42] denominations. That's God working out
[14:45] your footsteps, bringing you to where
[14:46] you're supposed to be. And this is a
[14:48] good scripture for meditation. I've
[14:49] mentioned many times Philippians 4:8.
[14:51] All those things in red, identify each
[14:54] of those in your journey. See Christ
[14:56] working in your love story, drawing you
[14:58] to him. Okay? Because they're in order
[15:00] of your journey of redemption. First you
[15:03] hear about the truth. Then you hear
[15:05] about, you know, it caused you to be
[15:06] honest with God, honest with yourself.
[15:08] Repent. That's just and pure. It's
[15:11] sanctification. Lovely is the baptism of
[15:13] the Holy Spirit. Good report. your life
[15:16] becomes a good report to Christ then you
[15:18] know uh your angel so to speak and carry
[15:20] a message back he's he's acting just
[15:21] like you um Lord he's acting just like
[15:24] it he's a he's a chip off the old block
[15:26] and then if there be any virtue these
[15:29] virtues and the statue perfect man there
[15:30] being any praise that capstone think on
[15:32] these things identify where each of
[15:34] these happen in your life it can be over
[15:36] a period of 10 20 years it didn't have
[15:39] to happen overnight that's for sure for
[15:41] most of us it
[15:42] doesn't so like the characters in the
[15:45] Bible It can be fulfilling scripture,
[15:46] reliving Bible stories, not realizing
[15:48] that you're actually a character in
[15:50] God's great drama. Your life is not a
[15:53] random series of events, but rather very
[15:55] carefully orchestrated plan with layers
[15:59] of perfection to bring you to him. I
[16:02] mean, layers. This thing just goes deep.
[16:04] If the more you meditate on it, you'll
[16:05] see it's he's been there the whole time.
[16:08] Looking unto Jesus, the author and
[16:09] finisher of our faith. He authors it.
[16:11] He's the writer of it, and he will
[16:12] finish it if you'll just keep going.
[16:14] Hebrews 12. Yeah, Hebrews 12. So, we
[16:19] might have been sure that our lives were
[16:22] not biblical, but it's inevitable they
[16:25] are biblical. We are reliving the Bible
[16:28] stories written by the great author of
[16:30] the great love story, Jesus Christ.
[16:31] Second Corinthians, ye are our epistles
[16:33] written in our hearts, known read of all
[16:35] men. For as much as ye are manifestly
[16:38] declared to be the epistles of Christ,
[16:39] ministered by us, written not with ink,
[16:42] but with the spirit of the living God,
[16:44] not in tables of stone, but in fleshly
[16:47] tables of the
[16:49] heart. All
[16:52] right. And all those forgot to mention
[16:55] too, all those characters in Hebrews 11,
[16:57] I just read one little uh excerpt from
[16:59] it, but you can read all of Hebrews 11.
[17:01] All their lives are what I'm talking
[17:02] about. They all re lived some part and
[17:05] showed some part of the character of
[17:07] God. So, here's a a remake of that story
[17:10] of the ranch bride and the armor meat
[17:13] packing boy. So, it has a little twist
[17:16] at the end. It's kind of surprising. So,
[17:17] just listen. So, there was once a boy
[17:20] aed 21 who worked for a meat packing
[17:23] company. Now, this is a true story. He
[17:27] had been praying for a while for for a
[17:29] while for some time. He went to a youth
[17:32] gathering where there were many eligible
[17:34] young ladies. Many of the girls at the
[17:36] gathering seemed flirty and the boy did
[17:38] not like that. So he went to the
[17:40] backside of the gathering trying to
[17:43] evade flirtatious girls. You know, just
[17:45] boy boy crazy girls, you know, it's the
[17:47] way they act and boys do some of the
[17:49] same stuff. Anyway, reaching the back,
[17:51] he met a certain young lady who carried
[17:54] herself quite differently from the
[17:55] others. She she dressed very modest, was
[17:58] not flirtatious, but rather backward and
[18:01] bashful. She was an orphan girl who had
[18:04] recently been adopted. She was
[18:06] accustomed to a life of
[18:09] servitude. The boy walked over to the
[18:11] girl and knelt down beside where she was
[18:14] sitting on a rock between two trees. He
[18:16] extended his hand and introduced
[18:18] himself. He said, "Hello, my name is
[18:20] Ryan."
[18:22] Being so bashful, she hesitatingly
[18:24] reached her hand toward his and replied,
[18:26] "Hello, my name is
[18:27] Gabby." That entire story, I mean,
[18:31] almost down to the detail of the the
[18:33] ranch bride and the army packing boy
[18:36] replayed on that day, October 14th,
[18:39] 2006, when me and my wife met for the
[18:41] first
[18:42] time. We didn't know the story. I was
[18:44] fairly new in the message. I'd heard
[18:46] brother Ben talk about it, but it didn't
[18:47] hit me the realization of what was
[18:49] really happening in that story. I didn't
[18:50] see the significance of it. Gabby wasn't
[18:52] really familiar with it, but it
[18:54] happened. And we were married for years
[18:56] before we realized this happened. Right
[18:57] under our noses. All right. And right
[19:00] after we met, the youth in the camp put
[19:02] on that play, as you see in that bottom
[19:04] picture called The Promise. They played
[19:06] the Cochman family song called The
[19:08] Promise based on that story and acted
[19:10] out that story after it had just
[19:13] happened on the whole camp in front of
[19:15] everybody. No one saw it. Even thus us
[19:18] that were in the play, me and my wife
[19:21] were main characters in the play. We
[19:22] didn't see it happen. Why did God do
[19:24] that? I don't know exactly, but I do
[19:26] know that story is everybody's story
[19:29] because it applies to everybody.
[19:31] Wherever you met the Lord on the back
[19:33] side of that camp or on the backside the
[19:35] back porch if you will where you left
[19:38] denominational denominational churches
[19:41] left the message ideologies the you know
[19:44] man's creeds and dogmas and ideas your
[19:46] own ideas and things that were off the
[19:48] word of God and you met God you got
[19:50] along with him met him for the first
[19:51] time so just like in that story uh Gabby
[19:54] and I got married one year later in that
[19:56] same town where we met just like the boy
[19:58] in the story that our prophet
[20:01] told. So, let me uh get caught up here
[20:04] in my notes. So, um the story has layers
[20:07] to it. There are so many layers to that
[20:09] story. First of all, it's God's story
[20:11] with his bride. It's the story of the
[20:13] natural story that took place. I believe
[20:14] it's a true story that brother Brown
[20:15] told as far as I know that actually
[20:17] happened, you know, out west and they um
[20:20] of the boy meeting the girl, but also
[20:21] mine and Gabby's story, but also every
[20:23] individual person's story. You know,
[20:25] there's there's so many layers to that
[20:27] story. It's very it's a it's a wonderful
[20:29] thing. And that's not even in the Bible.
[20:31] It's not a Bible story. It's just I
[20:33] believe God likes the story cuz it's him
[20:35] and the bride.
[20:39] So, and then uh we must each meet him on
[20:42] the back side of the desert. Now, faith
[20:43] demonstrates to the eye of the mind the
[20:46] reality of those things that cannot be
[20:48] discerned by the eye of the body. Faith
[20:51] is the firm ascent of the soul to the
[20:54] divine revelation and every part of it
[20:57] and sets to its seal that God is true is
[20:59] a full approbation of all that God has
[21:03] revealed as holy, just and good. It
[21:05] helps the soul to make application of
[21:08] all to itself with suitable affections
[21:10] and endeavors. And so to its designed is
[21:14] so it is designed to serve the believer
[21:16] instead of
[21:18] sight and to be to the soul all that the
[21:21] senses are to the body. Matthew Henry
[21:23] that's from B the Bible commentary about
[21:25] Hebrews 11. So just meditate on this
[21:30] uh through the week as you think about
[21:31] these things and think about your
[21:33] journey. And I I really encourage
[21:35] everybody to often, not just every every
[21:37] so often. I mean, I don't do I don't
[21:38] meditate on my journey every day, but
[21:40] you know, it's pretty often I go back to
[21:42] it and and begin to think, now why did
[21:43] that happen like that? Lord, where were
[21:45] you at in that? So, after the first
[21:48] meeting and proposal, the ranch bride
[21:50] started making herself ready. So,
[21:52] there's something for her to do. It
[21:53] wasn't just like, "Yay, he proposed to
[21:55] me. I'm going to get married and I'm
[21:56] going to go back to my daily chores
[21:57] now." No, she started making diligent
[22:00] ready uh diligent um uh time of
[22:03] preparation doing her wedding dress, you
[22:04] know, staying up burning the midnight
[22:06] oil, so to speak, staying up late at
[22:07] night. She kept up with her chores
[22:09] during the day, but at night she'd be
[22:10] working making that dress ready. And
[22:12] that's what we're to be doing. So,
[22:14] Revelation 19, let us be glad and
[22:16] rejoice and give honor to him, for the
[22:18] marriage of the lamb has come, and his
[22:20] wife hath made herself ready. Once we've
[22:23] accepted his proposal, we need to be
[22:25] diligently making ourselves ready. Okay.
[22:28] Uh you uh musicians can go and make your
[22:30] way up here if you will.
[22:32] Um had this I believe that was my last
[22:34] slide. Yeah.
[22:37] So just to review a couple of the things
[22:39] here, our footsteps are ordered of God
[22:42] and there's there's definitely, you
[22:44] know, a work of God going on in our
[22:46] midst. And just keep thinking about it
[22:48] and keep dwelling on it. And just don't
[22:49] ever think your life is insignificant.
[22:51] Don't ever think that your life is
[22:52] random and and just give give heed to
[22:55] those things and think about those
[22:56] things
[22:57] often. I believe that's all I have for
[22:59] today. So, thank you. God bless you.
