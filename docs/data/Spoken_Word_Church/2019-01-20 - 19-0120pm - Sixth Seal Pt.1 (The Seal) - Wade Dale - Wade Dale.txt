know so he told me to take a few minutes just right before he comes out but I wanted to give a follow-up a testimonial about something that I talked about on Wednesday all right the brother brother Eric the brother who we helped buy new tires for his truck and we call his truck a miracle truck I'm in that truck you know it's a it's a 1997 truck and he still tries to run it and everything I mean he has no money to buy something else so he tries to do with what he's got you know in his ministry well on the 31st of December I was ministering at his church and that was the day that it was the moment my wife and my and my anniversary after we I ministered at his church that night he went to take some brethren back to their home and before he left he checked the oil his oil light came on on his truck he wanted me to tell you all this because this was for the glory of God he his oil light came on in his truck and he and he looked at the at the oil stick and and there was no oil whatsoever in in the in the car nothing at all I mean he said he says I know there was nothing and so the brother that was there I still stayed back at the church me and my wife and my family we stayed back at the church with everybody else he said let me take these brethren home and the brother that was with him he said let's just drive up to my house I got about a quart of oil there in my house that you can put in there that may be enough for to take you back home and the drive from his church to his house it's about an hour drive so he said ok so they they went and they put the oil in and though he went back to pick us up from from the church from the brothers sister's house that we were waiting for him out so he told me he said but least listen my old light came on there was no oil in there but I thank God you know that that that the brother had a quart of oil he said that might be enough we're not sure he said but why don't we just pray let's just talk let's just pray and say Lord refills so we prayed then we asked the Lord he said we said Lord even if you if you have to just fill this car up with new oil if you have to right so we got home and we got home that night and and he did the little surprise party for us because he wanted to rush because they had that they had that going for us as well and Bella was all in it and she didn't even tell us and everything so anyways so the next days when we had to leave to go back to Nicaragua and brother Eric said that on this that was the first but then on the second he he needed to leave back again use the truck but before he went wherever he needed to go he said I'm gonna stop by the mechanic first about this oil thing to see where the oil is leaking so he went before he does that he always has to fill his radiator with water before he leaves because he's always constantly having problems with his radiator so he filled it up with water and he checked the oil he checked the oil stick and he said he said brother Luis God is my witness that oil stick was filled to where the top was that he said he said I don't I know the brother only had just a little bit of oil that he put in there so he said well let me do this I'm still gonna take it to the mechanic the mechanic looked at it he said he said sir he said that car is full of oil and there is no leak anywhere whatsoever and he said maybe that maybe it was an electricity problem you know the oil light came on and there was electricity pong gaming he took it to the electrician there and he looked at it and he said listen if the oil light came on in that truck you know that means there was no oil in the car and he said brother Luis God answered our prayer that night he filled that car up with all and I don't even know we only put just a little and tiny bit in there and so he wanted to let the church know that because you know he thought it was outstanding he said my goodness I know I know him I know he's still the same yesterday today he cares about our bodies just as much as he cares about anything you know that you need to use for his glory amen and that's not the only first time I've seen you know God working mechanically on a car you know he can do it so I just wanted he just wanted me to tell that for his glory amen and also he wanted me to mention that that a lot of the people of when you saw some of the pictures there there's people around his community that are new people that are coming into the church from just around town or he's got a lady that wants to be baptized and then somebody else that came to the Lord so after we we had left so who knows we you know we just plant the seed and then the Lord takes care of the rest amen praise God so we just thank him for that amen so we're gonna have brother Wade come and let's sing open the eyes of my heart let's stand to our feet I feel like I'm missing something there anything else okay open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to see you I want to see you open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to see to see you to see you [Music] shining in the light of your glory around your power we sing holy holy holy I lived at all shining in the [Applause] pour out your power [Music] as we say holy holy holy aim at me live today holy holy holy holy holy holy [Music] I want you see hey man turn around shake somebody's hands they God bless you good to be in the house of Lord today brother Matthew braces too blessed to be stressed too anointed to be disappointed to predestinated to be hated I like it while we're standing turn around and look at a sister and tell her thank you tell the sisters thank you and let's give him a great big hand when one of the sisters from another church he said how do y'all do it was such a big we had 122 people here yesterday and fed them all and you know what would see what we had leftover so sister asked me said how do you do this I said well I said we're not an organization but we are an organism even brother Branham talks with us being we're aren't organism an organism has to work together and that's what we did we or we were an organism we all work together and and you see how it works when everybody works together it works out great so food was good preaching was good fellowship was good I'm getting to that next turning looking a brother I got that right here on my nose turn around looking a brother and thank the brother especially our young people for helping putting stuff up taking stuff down it was a group effort on organism so now there's anything else the students I needed to talk about uh-huh the father's took care of the babies while the mothers did some work and give their minds and the food was outstanding I mean it was like real good and may I help clean up and it just worked out really well amen so for those of you that weren't here yesterday you missed a good fellowship meal so and I know we can't beard everyone these are not required functions but it is good to get with brothers and sisters I've like precious faith so if you got your Bibles let's turn to revelations but we're gonna start revelation 6:1 I'm gonna read through some of the seals and also some of you got this book most of us all did now the purpose of this book is it is a study book done by a good brother of ours a brother Trevor Edmund he's from Jeffersonville and he's been here a few times before but he compiled this book brother Dale looked over it and I look through it and it it's with brother Dale doing this the church ages starting into the church ages if he ever gets in them starting in the churches it's a study for every church age so take it home get with your wife get with your children and study brother jokes that he's still got a few people maybe they're not here but if you're if you're here and you got one you need to see brother Joe so you can so he can give them to you and you can start in them but it's really it's done extremely well and very professional so it's a good study guide go home listen to the seals and take the little test in here it's good to to help the jog the old memory so on think brother Joe Canada for bringing that to our attention all of our Oliver I was thinking yesterday all of our young guys they're so sharp and and all of us are getting so dull till we need the sharp ones I mean listen listen to me you can have dull knives in a drawer but you gotta have some sharp ones don't abs are for butter and stuff like that sharp knives are for steak so you need them both let's don't throw them let's no let's don't throw the the knives away their little not as sharp as they used to be so but it's good to have young people in here to to look at these things and bring it to our attention and you know get approval and and then do it in the right channel and doing it in the right channel makes everything it's an organism so but I thank them for for doing that for us the younger younger guys being able to find these things for us revelation 6 I'm just going to read through the seals and then we'll get down to number 6 now the sixth seal is going to be we're going to cover the sixth seal and then we're going to cover there is a thing called an interval between the sixth seal and a seventh seal we'll cover that I believe we need to cover it extensively because I think it's very important for us to see what God's done and what he's doing and what he's gonna do but my brother Dale said and it's very true this Bible was compiled you know I was thinking did you catch window what brother Dale was preaching cuz remember Paul and I Paul wrote part of the Bible but Iranians didn't Iranians did not actually listen I don't know that he actually read his church age in the book of Revelation skill John didn't write it till 1896 you see what I'm saying what I'm saying is Irina's didn't stand up and say now God told us with his way we're supposed to add no they acted that way because God knew they were gonna act that way and he put it in the Bible for John to write and for us to reflect on you know I'm saying Irina's didn't turn over to the Book of Revelations there was no Book of Revelations when I rainiest was was preaching and when the people of of the second Church age the Smyrna church age when they come to be this wasn't written in a book somewhere for them to read it but they did live it out just exactly though what God saw because why he was in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks with his quality in each church age at different different qualities God's got a variety he used all those like we were talking about this morning God uses fingers toes hands feet everything is all important we're all important in the body of Christ everybody is important so let's bow our heads and we get started on the sixth seal the Lord Jesus thank you for this day Lord we pray that you'd just be with us now you'd be the one that does the speaking Lord you'd be the one that does the revealing because without you Lord we're nothing you have sent us the greatest message on the face of this earth to the greatest people on the face of the earth so lord I pray that we would activate that faith that we have in this church age Lord that we were told that it was almost total darkness but there is a little bit light shining in goshen Father forgive us of our sins Lord we just got news that a family friend of ours wife passed away last night just be with a Charles Turk family they're just young people Lord and I pray that you'd just be with that family and touch them and give them comfort Lord we pray these things in Jesus name Lord be with the ones Lord in the foreign fields bless the missionaries Lord give them fruit for their labor bless us today and keep us in Jesus name we ask all these things amen all right let's just read through the seals and then we'll be seated and then we'll get started huh good to see sister Milka and the young man with us ben-hur mean and michael benjamin smile thank you good to have him with us today man I've always told you she's my idol single mama raised kids bless her heart that's what I mean she says she's done good job I mean she's just in really she knows I've told her that many times before revelation 6 verse 1 she's an inspiration there's people in your life that are inspiration she's an inspiration to me even though I'm in gym or not single parent but she's an inspiration for any other single parent that says I can't do this well talk to Milka she tell you had done number one you put God first and put a smile on your face that no one can take off right hey man man I tell you I'm gonna tell you this story before I do but Malcolm and Jim we're going where were we we were Miami what's he we were some yeah we were Miami or somewhere and you were helping us she was you know working in the chicken to see we were flying standby and she'd send us a message looks like you're gonna get on this flight nope nothing like you're gonna get on that one yep look like you're gonna get on this one nope don't like doing get on this one she's back and forth and back and forth and I but she was sweating as much as we were so but thank God she was there at least letting us know we weren't gonna get on the flight which we didn't we spent the night in Miami Airport no thanks to her are it's okay if your face would be red and be ready Melanie and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see I saw him behold a white horse and he that selling him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer him when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and they went out another horse that was red and power was given him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword the reason I'm reading this I want to bring it back to your memory because you know what subliminally subliminally inside your brain you are thinking about what's been preached before whether you are thinking there's no way you can think it through fast but each seal comes up and you're like okay that's justification okay that's sanctification okay that's the Holy Ghost okay and I heard him when he had opened the third seal I heard the third beast say come and see I'll be held in a little black horse and him to set on he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his name I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for penny three measures of barley for a penny see thou hurt not the oil and the wine the Holy Ghost in the stimulation and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast they come and see I look to behold a pale horse in his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth and when he had opened the fifth seal this is when we just got finished with I saw under the altar the souls immediately you know we're in another dimension now because there's no other Beast the Beast powers are gone and they're not here anymore on this fifth seal all right I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given under every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow-servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were now see that's gonna tie in with this next seal coming up should be fulfilled and I beheld now watch because watch what John says I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals number one and when he had opened the second seal and when I'm reading here in verse five and when he had opened the third seal and when he had opened the fourth seal and when he had opened the fifth seal now john changes his wording he changes his wording on this seal he says I beheld when he opened the sixth seal he's bringing it down to right here and I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake why because what happened John watch what I'm saying John saw people persons the first seal whether it was a whoever he saw he saw a man sitting on a horse right second seal he saw a man sitting on a horse third seal he saw a man sitting on the horse fourth seal he saw a man sitting on a horse fifth seal he sees people souls under the altar here he doesn't he goes into nature all right everybody see that same man and when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood no people happenings events nature all right there be ok with that and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll this was a long long one but we got a cover and the heaven departed as a scroll when it was rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places now he comes he's not talking to the bride and he's talking about people that are now on the earth during this song he sees this first and then he comes up and here pops up and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men now that's all people that are left on the earth that's not the bride we already gone upon a for sale all right so we're not hearing the fit the fifth seals not the bride this sixth seal isn't that's not the bride the men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand a man you may be seated in the Lord that is blessing to the reason we're who shall be able to stand well that's not us that's not even the fifth seal gee that's not the 144,000 that's the Kings and natural men of the earth that alright say ma'am alright that's the natural kings of the earth so let's dis seal in it thanks sir thank you for the day this seal starts out with John looking at nature John looking at something that's going on on the earth after the rapture amen after the church is gone the the fifth seal Jew is not standing there literally right the man fifth seal Jews not there in that he's looking actually in this dimension that we're talking about this is Adam it this is our dimension he's back on the earth he's talking about earthquakes happening right here on the earth thereby alright with that cuz that's where you stick we got to bring this six Elam as being something that happens to nature something that happens to a natural world we've been talking now the first seal sure it had a natural meaning but it also had a spiritual meaning too because it was to purr there's always two powers God's power and Satan's power when you see a horse rider when you see a man get on a horse and ride through the first future changes as we were discussing a long time ago over a year ago now when we started we saw that that was a power in opposition to what had already been there because remember God is the originator Satan is not the originator of anything he's a pervert er of what's already original so they were men on the earth in the first church age preaching the truth of the gospel then satan comes in and perverts what God's already doing all right so that was your seals that we were talking about the seal one through three is the first two three they okay with that we know where we're at we've been we've been here we don't want to background too much but this is church age one two three is showing the first seal second seal is the fourth church age which is the red horse black horse was during Martin Luther and John Wesley and the fourth seal has to be in this age because we take a rapture after the fourth seal so the fourth seal happens I mean the rapture happens on the fourth seal so we go up so this is all bride I mean the bride just vacates the building we're going we're not even in this dimension all right then you bring a fifth seal Jew which is in another dimension they were in this dimension but they were killed so they're in another dimension that John looks in that dimension but as I told you before maybe maybe we got it maybe within maybe want to go back over to him but when you come to these first four we look at these first four seals and I want you to see this we have actively been involved without those seals actively been involved which is justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost in the word main manifest or we can look back through the book through what brother Dale is gonna start on the church Agence we can look in the church age book and brother Branham gives us the history of every one of the church ages and what happens all the way up to here so we have been actively participating in all these because this is your Redemption this is your this is the bride's this is our revival right here we're in our own but this was the revival coming out of what Calvary where Christ divorced the Jews divorced Israel in the Old Testament and married a Gentile bride I was thinking today do you know you cannot have a bride without a groom because you say I'm the bride of if there's no groom you can't say you're a bride know you may be betrothed and you may be going with somebody what we call used to call going steady you know we swap numbers phone numbers back then you know that was us going steady or going out or going with somebody but when June and I were setting a marriage date she then became what potentially she became my bride but now live she can't be a bride without a groom but a groom can't be a groom without a bride think of that God is not complete without me and you God he didn't just have to have a bride he wanted the bride and you know what he didn't want a divorce Israel but let's I was telling us in school downstairs this morning during Moses his life we see the commentary of Moses goes obviously after the fact but God you ever step in make every time he'd fall every time he'd get up every time he do good every time you do bad God saw every bit of it but Moses didn't Moses had to live through what God had already saw you and I have to live through these church ages and thank God for a prophet that went back and told us every Church age what happened connecting it to a city connecting it to a star because remember when brother Dale got to those seven stars your 7 stars are the 7 messengers and we put a lot on the messenger it's the message it's the message behind the messenger and then it's the message that God is using that conduit of arrhenius Martin Columbo Paul Luther Wesley and brother Brown of a conduit to use so that you are not what did I say last Sunday who's gonna take a rapture who's gonna take a body change so it's personal you're not gonna take a body change because brother Dale does you're gonna take a body change because you come to a place that you say I and my father are one amen that makes it real personal Jesus walked up one day and he didn't he didn't say now if you'll say thus saith the Lord that mountain of move Jesus never said thus saith the Lord he was the Lord so now you and I have to live in the age of thus saith the Lord brother Brent said the brothers have thus saith the Lord or she'd be still that didn't say he didn't say she'd have thus saith the Lord that was it because brother Branham said when you begin to say I and my father are one and these other things the show could pull away see a lot of people cannot swallow that your God without having to go through brother Branham ain't it the truth like brother Forney was talking yesterday appreciate yesterday it's Jesus Christ is who we gotta help he breathing room can change your body brother Dale can change your body but if you say I am is gonna change your body and you say ok there's going to change your body that's why I said we're we're a lot Tunis it's either God knows and then like somebody said oh brother and he said then it's got God brother branham on us that makes us a Trinity again and not you know listen and I think we say it kind of hard here because of all the but brother Forney said it last night he it's william branham cannot change your body he brought us a word that we can look to and clear back all the stuff because even we were talking about this morning brother Lewis mentioned the quote broke where we're gonna take a body change folks it's gonna be Jesus Christ is gonna change our body no one has come to immortality except that one man no one so him in you will bring the body change amen and it's trusting in the word that's already been wrote when Jesus said it was finished at Calvary he needed nothing else brother Branham said if he Jesus Christ were to come and stand right here tonight in a three-piece suit he cannot heal you or save you all he could say is I've already done it that's all he could say I've already done it so when we come to these seals you say while they open up the clothes the big debate well if you don't believe them they're closed if you believe them and live them they're open amen and what a great thing that a prophet brought us all these messages and we were able to collect them in tape and book form and able to know that he's not talking about himself he's talking about Jesus Christ amen he's talking about it does us no good to realize brother Branham was at the headstone doesn't make you no big thing if you realize brother they'll come to headstone you got to put yourself in the picture what are we doing we're diverting our our faith to if it's like I told brother Homer likes now listen sit down and think for a little while we're all a bunch of Catholics where the Browns gonna come back save us all well no he's not he ain't say nobody welcomes this place we go he's gonna take a rapture who's gonna take a body change all right well then it's God in you it says in the Bible Christ in you the hope of glory and to me Christ is the seals because what is this this is the plan of redemption all right so we've become intimate with these first four seals because that is if you're born again today and you're breathing if you're born again in your breathing your your your your going higher in God okay I said if you're born again and breathing in that order you can be breathing and not born again but if you're breathing and born again and you come and sit under the spout that you've been given something's got to happen something there has got to be a growth or you just don't have it something's got to be inside you going I need some more of that I need some more of that see I need some more you say well the fourth seal we take a rapture what else do we need we got to understand how this guy gets changed because up here when we look at this seal one through four what who was it somebody oh somebody said you're gonna hate me for this but people have been born again never heard of William Branham even been born again as never heard of the seals but people have never been born again and not heard of Jesus Christ so let's put that in the bottom line never has a man got born again without knowing Jesus Christ as a personal Savior now then what's he gonna do like brother funny said the Holy Ghost is what's going to turn you and lead you and guide you into all truth all right so you get born again first but our Commission let's think about this our commission today is to take a body change that's our Commission that's our that's my commission and you know do the same thing go to the point like this it's your commission to take a body change but we're waiting on brother Nell to preach and so we camp Jesus has already preached it hey listen Jesus already preached the seals he's already died he's already had a resurrection he's already had glorification a glorified body and he's already ascended somewhere we know where it is but I'm just telling you somewhere right what's he waiting on waiting on Who I am to realize that the I am is not back there and I like what brother again what brother Jason Watkins most people that are in their denomination and this is true you think about when you come up you are getting maybe not born again but saved by historic God Jesus died on the cross two thousand years ago yeah but what about the day of Pentecost when he come back and what about when you were sitting in an old church some wearing some preacher with the Holy Ghost speaks to your heart that's not a dead man talking to you that's a live man talking to you that's live God speaking through a man to you and then that what that bursts you into the body amen but the Bible says being born again so we have to come through these four seals but we have to like I said before we have to laugh them back and put five six and I can I'm gonna put seven over here just for a cuz there's a gap right here a pretty good one too but we'll get into that later on I don't want them I don't want to get into that today but you see that there's a gap you read six seals there's a gap you reach six trumpets there's a gap you read all these different ones after six there's a gap even brother Branham preached six seals and what do you do he stopped and had questions and answers and then he preached the seventh seal always a gap somewhere in there there's a gap between six and seven all right so and we'll discuss that because I believe I under kind of understand what's going on with that but seal number five was what it's not just justification in a baby form it's a justified group of people that never sinned and you gotta realize that you don't just it's been here say for so many years oh we're coming to something oh we're coming to something [Music] well is he I am coming to something and I am as an ever-present and even at the burning bush God got Moses his attention with the bush burning but when he said I said who are you he said he didn't say just say I am he said I am that I am he's saying I'm that one that you've been looking for I am that I am not that I am that I am he's not double saying itself he's telling him I am that I am that I am what Jesus when he come on earth he said I'm what I'm the sheep for I'm the sheet I'm the shepherd I'm the sheepfold I'm the door I'm the root I'm the offspring he named everything he was you know what he was saying I am that I am I'm that I let me just put it in Georgia language I'm I am and that's what I am I am I am that's I am I am I am that and he was identifying himself who he was now you and I got to do the same thing well yeah we know he would we're kicking it back no that's and I was and yes and I'm gonna be this is an I am this right here is the I am amen so the fifth seal shows us a group of people that were saved or born again not born again but given white robes I guess you stay safe given white robes for nothing they did nothing but because God blinded his own children's eyes at Calvary divorced Israel took a Gentile bride he said I'm gonna save that group of people you know what he done he's done the same thing to you he said to seven church age is the worst Church age there is no like there's no way but now brother Brown said I drew a little light in there why there's got to be a born-again group there's got to be like brother faughn he said where there's light there's blood I like that was good yesterday for the shorter length I mean he pries that was really good but where there's light they had to see to be able to put the blood over the doorpost they had to be able to see where to put the thing they had to be able how many of you tried to cook in the dark I fly brother Warren he said I don't want to eat your food he's that something moving he said you know yeah but if they have lights on it you can see how many of your sisters for the blindfold on and cook you can't do that you cut your finger off for some ingredients and I'm going to get there what do you say Castrol is two casseroles did a vegetable oh well that would be a revelation oh man but that's what it would be but so without light coming and like said without light coming in the end time listen you're born again today you're light you're the light of this church age you're the light of God from the age that you were born in but this light is not going to be damned our lights not now the world is but our lights never going to be dim God's lights never dim down oh please come on people that would make God become weak and then stronger and win oh man his light has been when God said let there be light that light has never been put out of course we know that's not the Sun in the moon we know that don't we because they were created a little bit later than that light was me and you because Jesus when he come and said I am the light of the world you were in him and he said then you're gonna be the light you're gonna be the to the first church age the second church age third fourth fifth sixth seventh alright that alright say man you are the light of the world who's the light of the world good job man good class today good class today so you know what subliminally now that would mean in your subconscious mind we know we took a body change right here but now the force field in it didn't explain how but subliminally now we're going to look with this the reason I'm bringing that word in because in the sixth seal now the fifth seal is pretty cut-and-dry it shows a group of people that was given eternal life that didn't want it and that you and me but it also it's showing me too and you that God's gonna save a group of people regardless of anything regardless that brothers like brother Forney said yesterday when when that when that body change comes and when that revelation comes it's gonna roll right into a rapture you can't stop it Satan can't stop it it's gonna roll you right into the wedding supper it's gonna roll you right into the future home it's gonna roll I mean the Millennium roll you right into the future you can't miss it those who his glory so I said that they didn't those who his glory justified he's already those who he justified right here he's already glorified now who's the only person has been glorified the seventh seal who's the seventh seal Jesus Christ he's standing today in a glorified body no one else is or the Bible is wrong when it said what only one man has reached immortality right and that's Jesus Christ he was once a mortal and now he's immortal no one else is that way I you explained any other way you want to about Elijah and all these other people I'm going by what the Bible says Bible said the only one person reached the immortality and that's Jesus Christ in other words he was immortal now he's in mortal you know you could brother Dale was reading something this morning but Lazarus could step up and say oh if you read revelations one in there where he says I was dead now I'm alive I'm alive forevermore Lazarus could have said part of that scripture I was dead now I'm alive but he died again anybody's been resurrected from the dead has died again so they can't say I'm dead and alive and alive forevermore only one man can say that that's Jesus Christ now that's the man we got to get here to change your body and then that's the man we got to get here no other man no other Church a messenger no other prophet priest our King has reached this except one man and that's Jesus Christ and he has already told us how to do it we just got to believe it so the fifth seal we got finished with it now the sixth seal the ones that reason I said subliminally because under the sixth seal there's going to be some things that we're gonna have to touch on like brother Branham remember he preached the sixth seal Anini says we're gonna preach the trumpets remember seven at seven not the Feast of the trumpets he preached that oh but he was gonna take each trumpet one running after the other right gonna get the school gonna get all these things and do that and then what do you do he said I had a hard time with that many of you preached the sermon a few ministers you-you-you man I mean you're like Elijah you want to plow in that field right there and you feel like you've bumped into that row and here you're going all of a sudden you your mule ain't moving right right brother Bob right by Larenz I'm your brother Luis bollo oh you brother Larry some of you you want to go this way so bad and you bout bloody left mules mouth trying to get it to chain hang on James why God wants something else done so that's why he was her brother Bryan brother Brown member you got to remember he said I was gonna preach him he said I didn't feel right something didn't come he kept saying something's wrong something wrong and then God revealed to him after he had already preached the sixth seal he said you preached him supernaturally under the sixth seal so he was preaching two messages in one I asked what he said he was preaching the trumpets under the sixth seal now then he comes in priest to feast of the trumpets that's a little bit different because that's the Feast of the trumpets besides one two three four five six seven and even if you'll read in your Bible trumpet one through six there's an interval then the seventh trumpet alright so you see there's an interval to that too so subliminally or supernaturally ever how you want to pronounce that there is something going on on every one of these seals and we know what that is that's the thunder that's the voice of God speaking to you I sent up here and I can give you a dissertation for hours hours we've been at it a year February is when I started last year on the seals we've been a year we're just on number six I mean we're well we're starting on number six but you see how this word of God is eternal but you cover what you can but you would the Holy Ghost has got you have got to fill in the gap you fill in the love letter because you know what it's not a love letter to me it's a love letter to the I am hey that's pretty good from the I am to the I am you know what I don't hear say here say is when you go from one person to another individual but when that same person speaking to you that all right damn it all right so that's how we're gonna set this sixth seal up we're going to go through the natural part of the seal just for a minute we're gonna close in just few minutes I don't have you look on your paper you don't have a bunch to read but we've come to the fifth seal where we see purely justification grace that's the Great Seal of the Bible brother Brown said now we've come to a sixth seal which we're going to read in a minute brother Brown says that's the tribulation seal of the Bible okay so we're going to take the natural part of the tribulation I know we're not going to be in it but we need to understand a few things because you know what your tribulation is now it's not your tribulation that will pray for me then yeah pray for Thank You Louise pray for me Lisa's wife's been gone for a week he said some tribulation I'll guarantee you keep up with two girls I was just glad to handle the same shoe I mean you know I just make sure one of them one black one went red Zoe's is right out there in the hallway so let me break in here just a minute we need to pray for brother homeland Laura he's struggling he's having a hard time hard time he was telling June he said when we got when sister Margie and her brother of home I mean brother jewel was talking about coming her coming back you know a glorified condition coming back you know what happened when brother branham go when he went across the curtain of time he said his first wife came and said to my precious brother and hugged his neck he said it's Marge you did that to me I'd stop her and go no no no you're mine you're mine he misses that woman I'm telling you he misses her bad so let's we need to pray for him what's the to or one they meant the tour one he just had he's he's struggling he's he's okay but you know what he was married for another sixty years and now she's not there so let's pray for him we're still humans we got human things we have to deal with you don't know why God took her but you know what I don't question it he doesn't either he doesn't question God he questions itself a lot but he doesn't question God all right so let's read right here just a few minutes and then we'll be done now the sixth seal is the tribulation seal so we are gonna have to go through a tribulation before we get a body change not a natural tribulation not a three-and-a-half-year tribulation but you're gonna have to go through hell on earth though this has never happened look at Jesus Christ he didn't have it wasn't easy for that man either the devil still beat on him right up to Calvary brother Brahim said that death whatever was buzzer or something was buzzing around you know buzzing buzzing but right at death theythey says I got you now well he just didn't know he what he got same way with me and you he thinks he can do that to me and you but when once we come to where we're sealed in I was thinking about Rodell so my job this is why I look at it you and I are all earthly human people that have human jobs we have human families we have human thoughts in our mind we're just human all right but there is I love that song the lily of the valley cuz I love the phrase that says there's a wall of fire around you you have nothing to fear what did he lie shisei tuga haze' go hazel there's more for us than they are for them and go hazel with no revelation he goes one to ten thousand one to ten thousand Elijah said God open his eyes open his eyes and it wasn't that they came they were already there cuz he lasha by revelation was already seeing him if not he will ki couldn't said when he said he said open my servants eyes and then when he opened his eyes what do you see he saw ring of fire angels around that servant well that's the same way with me and you when we move God moves with us there's a wall of fire all he done with job was as he left them he let the flame down just a little bit and let Satan do what he wanted to do with his life couldn't kill him though God listen God the only one who can kill you only one now you can die death but God's only one can allow it let's get you a Christian but I just think of a wall of fire and then as you walk that fire just stays with you that's your guardian angel that's your protection is that fire around you because what fires the most it's the most thing it's a pure fire what fire is so there's a wall of fire around me there's nothing now to fear he's the lily of the valley and he's right there with you all the time amen 50 let's read this let's read these quotes and then we'll finish I was just gonna try to get the sixth seal what the sixth seal is gonna do is it's going to show something is going to happen in nature that's never happened before now listen there was one time that God destroyed the world by nature by water but that wasn't nature as far as nature being the animals and all the you understand what I mean he destroyed it by water man this is not just water did you all read that with me as everything else it's I'll get the right piece of paper what to do with it what is it it's earthquake son becoming black moon becoming blood stars falling to the earth amen heavens departing as a scroll that's never happened before every mountain and Island were moved out of their place a total brother Brown says disruption of nature 50 and I notice here when we come to this fifth seal now there's no writer goes for it there's no beast to announce that John just the lamb open it and John saw it there was no one there to say now look come and see I just told you that notice no power of the living creature are there on the sixth seal there's no beasts to announce it either in other words and on the seventh seal there's no beasts to announce it no power to announce that no one does look after the fourth seal there's no announcement of any beast power from the six six six fifty six or seven not at all all right why because this is my revelation we know one thing's for sure the we go up on the fourth seal and those four combat beasts is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is inside of you but the fifth sixth and seventh seal is personal more personal than just a new birth you see how personal can you be you got to become God you got to become Jesus Christ you are Jesus Christ in your soul but you need he was Jesus Christ body spirit and soul so why can't you have the Holy Ghost in your spirit I just a question just question yeah I'm just asking questions here just throwing something out there throwing a nugget out let you think about because we don't cover I mean really Jesus's Spirit was the Holy Spirit he had no carnal mind and I thought he said he came to do away with your carnal mind see is this as this thing builds I'm telling you this thing builds you gonna gain you've got to be able to gain more confidence in what God's already said not what he's gonna say not that there's coming angels around us not that there's coming a wall of fire when we need it no there's a wall of fire around you all the time they meant when Adam and Eve walked through the Garden of Eden brother Branham said they had a Holy Ghost Baylon and that kept them away because they had no carnal mind they weren't born babies they weren't born by sex they were created hello ain't no what we going back to because when God changes this body it's not gonna be what come out of mom and daddy anymore we'll have a body the Bible says like unto his glorious body will be changed in the atoms that all right six seal number two I'm sorry number two we got guys training in the back and that's great I appreciate joing them and they're able to sit out here brother Anderson brother Joe was able to sit out here and enjoy the service now brother Bob he's a different story anyway well I'm not telling anyway bob was in the back and I watched the service the other day of mine and I was a little more adamant and moving around a little bit well I didn't know who was running the camera but it would be on this quote and I'd be over here writing something about the time I got finished right here he'd switch over there and I'd be over here and then I you'd hear my voice and I wouldn't be anywhere I said Bob he said bro wait I was so caught up in what you were saying he said I forgot what I was doing which is fine that's okay but there's people watching that might want to see something so I told him I said we need to get out no I'm not gonna I did I made a horrible statement I said well I don't know we might get him saved I said we need to find a Center off the street let him come in here run the camera he might get saved you might want to do that but the kids do a real good job not that they don't pay attention but their mind is sharper than some of ours but I watched that thing and I'm like who did I thought Bob see brother wait I was just froze ionise and then I'd realize I'd having to run the camera in he'd get by the hand Bob's come a long way [Applause] if we hadn't said that to him five or six years ago he'd been a floor now he I'm sure his hands are dripping wet but we're an organism it takes all of us all right but they are training some some helping the band that's great I love cross-training man that means if somebody's out somebody step right in step four Bob somebody can step right hey but you know what some jobs you want to get fired from you want to get fired from that job that's good all right let's get back to what we're told by this six seal is the Tribulation Period that's what takes place now look the bride's gone do I need to stop for a moment or what sure okay yes yes okay oh yeah oh yeah he's entered into another dimension that's not what I thought when I was watching the thing though but I was actually thinking other things that I had to repent for but but see that's God working that's that's God working so that's okay right Bob he's like never touching that thing no more but the six a list of tribulation period that's what takes place but the bride is gone you said brother now why don't we have to cover this by the way why do we have to cover this because it is you it is you it is a disruption of your nature it is something that God has got to do to you that he's never done to a nice group of people before he's done it one time oh yeah that was tipped listen Abraham got a temporary body changed but Abraham could not say I'm alive forevermore no he had seven more kids and he died he's in the grave somewhere waiting on you and I okay so there's whole things waiting on us to come to a place so we're going through our tribulation now your sisters walk through Walmart it's a tribulation for the people that look at you and either laugh or scoff or say why do you have to do that right that's the tribulation you have created a tribulation pyrrha the tribulation doesn't start until we leave the real one the natural tribulation why because you're here because they're not going to start a tribulation with his old bride inside that tribulation no we're going to be gone the bride has gone see there's no living creature nothing there to say it it's just now God is not dealing with the church no more look after we leave that even the sixth seal brings in 144,000 but that's not the bride that's not the bride remember he's divorced his Jewish bride he cannot remarry her again but they can come back his sermons now God is not dealing with the church no more it's been gone he's dealing with Israel 144,000 this is the other side this is when Israel receives the message of the kingdom by the two prophets of revelations 11 remember we are not here when they start their message because the anointing that comes off of us goes right over to the Jews two witnesses first and then 144,000 after that in 1260 days I believe it is remember Israel is the nation God's servant nation and when Israel is brought in it'll be a national affair Israel the kingdom agents were David the son of David set some throne there brother I'm doing that all the way to the Millenium because remember the Millennium is not to us the Millennium is to the Jews there was a promise Oh what we know there's a promise that that will live a thousand years because a thousand years of the day and God said the day you eat there we know all that but still bottom line is to the Jews it is a honeymoon for us we're there to observe and but listen we're going to be sitting beside King David because we're says bride hey man not literal David the son of David Jesus Christ is going to be sitting there but those 144,000 and whoever else is there fifty of juhi that whoever is going to be there will know that we're not Jews we're his Gentile bride because we're a mini membered body but they're gonna have tribal order will read it later on they'll have tribal order each one will have their tribes Dan Ephraim and all those all right I'll have their tribes they'll have their place to live there's a Millennial temple that's got to be built all these different things listen that Millennial temple does have nothing to do with me and you but when we walk into that temple according to brother Branham according to the six fold purpose of daniel seventy weeks the last one is to anoint the most holy it's not the jews coming back into the temple it's you and i because it's us and our husband it's the bride in the bridegroom walking into the temple anointing the temple with what not sacrifices not bad your skin human skin change human skin amen number three real quick number three we're stealing a 6-cell we find out now John said I beheld and when he had opened the sixth seal there was a great earthquake then all nature was interrupted God's been doing great things like healing the sick open the eyes of the blind doing great works but we find out here that nature takes that took a tumble yes all nature look what taking place the earthquake the Sun was black the moon wouldn't give its light and the stars shook and fail and why why everything happens see right at the time of the opening of this sixth seal so you and I don't get the literal opening of the seal it opens remember what brother Brown said the two prophets open the seal all right so we're not here but we get the spiritual implication we get to what the supernatural element that's underneath that seal you and I get it you and I have to have something happen to our body that no one has ever had happiness that one man and it's not us coming to like Bozo said easy move my hands young but the rest of them it's not you know and I still got these back problems but why Allah got some good hat no it's your total body your body is going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and not a piece is gonna be left off and why everything happened right at the time of the opening of this sixth seal that's when it takes place right immediately after the announcement of those martyrs who are the martyrs fish seals you the martyrs had been finished in other words the martyrs been given white robes they're done actually they're in a place hello they're in a place John saw them in a place and they're there in a place until the hundred forty four thousand gets killed that's what the Bible says all right now number four now the earthquake let us compare scripture now you got pencil on paper I want you to do something for me if you want to write write these because unless you're going to take the tape now I want you to read with me as you do compare scriptures of this great event that we will see that this great secret or mystery that was under the sixth seal of the book of redemption so he's sliding that stick seal still in the book of redemption now remember these are hidden mysteries and the sixth seals altogether not I think he meant and I'm not interpolating here but I guess I am he's meaning six seals because the six seals not one book all six seals mate one book because remember the book of redemption is only six seals I'll read your quote okay back there six seals finishes Redemption that's all we're going to talk about the finished redemption is six seals the seventh is just a silence in heaven for half an hour that's all but you got to have him here to do all the to do the six alright that's the problem we we don't have him here all the way he's here we're just missing something something maybe we'll just quit missing stuff and the sixth seal altogether is one great big book just seat Scrolls rolled together and it unwinds the whole book of Redemption that's how the whole earth was redeemed and that's remember when we asked when he talks about Earth ain't talking about this ball because this earth will never get Redemption until you get redemption in your earth so who's you waiting on thank you you're getting Donnie you getting pretty quick me I figured you over there with that sunshine we'd be saying German talking cake anyway number five if that is so now for we know that this seek seal is the judgment seal so anything that happens under the sixth seal is a judgment I'm just reading what he said it's a judgment it's the judgment seal exactly what it is now see we've had the Antichrist ride seen the church go now it's finished goes up then we see the martyrs he's on the fifth seal of them Jews back there under the altar now here is the breaking fourth of the judgment upon the people were out of this tribulation judgment will come forth 144,000 redeemed Jews I'll prove to you they are Jews not Gentiles they have nothing to do with the bride not a thing and the bride we done seen the bride's gone you can't place that anywhere else don't come back until the 19th chapter of the book of Acts he means the 19th chapter of the book of revelations we know that now notice for the sixth seal is the judgment seal of the word thereby alright with that say men now what's gonna happen here let's go to Matthew 24 and I want to stop here just a second just for a second mm-hmm if you've got your Bible if you want to turn to it you don't have to but what happens is in Matthew 24 Jesus preaches the seals right he preaches him right down the line till he gets to number five and then he stops because the sixth seal is Matthew 29 through 31 look in your Bibles his history okay he separated it out because I believe the sixth seal to me that's your body change that's the change of your body right Jesus wants you to think about a little bit he's all right there's a guy he talks about something else right he talks about something else and then he says hey immediately after the tribulation of those days what the tribulation of you getting the body change now don't you think it's going to thunder and lightning and earthquake when your body gets changed when something eternal steps into this dimension and brings a bunch of people with it six dimension people come into this dimension man that's more eternal than you've ever seen on the face of this earth at one time all right this world is gonna go into chaos even for 30 to 40 days it can go into chaos that's not gonna bother you because you're gonna get a body change and you stand right in the middle of a nuclear explosion and it will not hurt you you say give me an apple while this thing blows up let me eat something I mean really didn't Jesus walk through a wall say give me some fish well what's the difference in walking through a wall and standing in front of a nuclear bomb none we just think old nuclear bomb will be all that no hey that's all down here has nothing to do with what you're gonna get immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the Sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of heaven shall be shaken doesn't that really sound like revelation and then shall the sign of the Son of man that and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven what's your silence on a man resurrection resurrection and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory and he shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other now we're gonna cover this I just want to read this kind of you know drop some breadcrumbs all right revelations 11 we're gonna read this because this is where the two witnesses come in and then we'll close because the sixth seal is probably going to take a little while to piece it all together and that was given me a reed like unto rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that worship therein but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles Jim Thompson going out of court and the Holy City shall they tread under foot forty and two months all right that's 42 months how long is that three and a half years according to the 30-day calendar they got that same am we covered the thirty day calendar brother Branham did that's your prophetic calendar not thirty one thirty twenty-eight thirty days to a month and then he topped out with your sisters you understand 28 to 30 days you understand the cycle of life goes through the same thing and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore which what is 3 times 2 6 so it's a thousand two hundred and sixty days clothed in sackcloth so they're gonna preach 1260 days now that's three and a half years not according to our calendar that's why you can't calculate Daniel seventy weeks down to a point because God uses his calendar of 30 days and we use 31 or the Gregorian or the Julian calendar which is up and down and we explained all that I don't think we did up here but we did downstairs the reason they have all that remember you're 29 days in February because if you didn't keep counting that extra day over four years summer spring and you'd be having winter in the middle of July so they do that to reverse everything by because why because the Earth's tilted now during the millennium I don't think there's gonna be tilted I think it's gonna be standing straight up because when you and I come on this earth we're gonna be straight up right now we're kind of stooped over about 30 degrees yeah that was plenty weather really I mean really you know you won't be stooped over when you're 20 you went stooped over you stood straight on axis and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy 1203 score days clothed in sackcloth these are the two olive trees the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth what is it two witnesses if any man will hurt them fire not literal fire they're not going to be fire-breathing dragons what the word whatever they say it's going to happen devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed wow these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy which was Elijah three and a half years and have power over waters to turn to blood Moses in the Nile River and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will the whole worth like I said it's not just Jerusalem and not just his ruin Syria and whatever cuz you know what everybody's gonna try to kill them two guys and they're just gonna say nope that's not gonna happen you're dying and you understand what I'm saying and when they shall have finished their testimony I want to bring in a little fault right here it just it just came to me now you and I couldn't be the two witnesses we know that right because we're not Jews but we couldn't be the two witnesses and be the bride you wouldn't do that if you would stand on this earth and do that to somebody in other words you have no brotherly kindness you have power without character now I'm not saying they don't have power without character but there's prophesied of what they'll do but a true bride won't do that so they're not bride they're giving the baptism of the Holy Ghost but they're not bride hey man hey man they ain't gonna have time to preach statue of a perfect man they're gonna be perfect inside but look you and I can't do that we stole money this morning you got to Paul said in Romans 11 you've got to love those that hate you love them you got a agape love them not feel you love them you got a cop I love them it's easy for me to love brother Kali you look but what about somebody that hates your guts it's now I'm supposed to love them the same identical way as I love brother Kali or I have a problem with my brotherly kindness but it's real easy for me to love brother Kali but what about somebody in out in the street out here that's just none you're wrong and done everything in the world to you that's why brother Brown said that fifth seal Jew could not be bribed cuz they're saying avenge our blood what are you gonna kill these people when you gonna take them all the way another word avenge our blood but now you've never said that I hope being a Christian you've never said God avenge me on somebody else now that's not true you better not do that that's why brother Brown said power without character you've got the Holy Ghost even when you start but you can't go out there and start speaking things you might speak your boss out of existence one day and I'd be messy really I mean really we don't call judgment on nobody why the Bible says don't judge sure we're gonna stand in judgment no doubt but that's after all this is finished but we can't stand here and ain't say wow that guy cut me off Lord I wish you just flip his car over three or four times right we wouldn't do that would we it's not like L said O Lord see it wouldn't be in our character but these guys right here somebody does something to them they do it right back to them Moses and Elijah Old Testament prophets not born again sure they get the Holy Ghost but they're not bribed they're not they don't have sure they've got to have some part of the character of God but they nothing do this not and do that they can't brotherly kindness and if somebody does something to them they'd kill him if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed now you you might have thought that in your in your human yeah right yep thank you brother dick brother dick says they deserved it well see that's the way we look at it we look at why something happens something they deserve that no you noticed a Christian you don't say that you don't say that you have compassion Jesus said even on the cross they done nailed him to the cross and stripped his clothes off naked and pulled most of his beard out put a crown on his head and he said Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing see that's that's the bride hang in there that's not that's not that's not this that's the bride hang in there Father forgive them they know not what they're doing because what did Stephen do Stephen was being stoned by his own brethren that was his people that was stoning him and he said Father forgive them see that's the that's the Christian attitude that's the Holy Ghost filled born-again Christian attitude is that and then I just wanted to bring that out cuz sometimes you see that you go man they're really you know they don't have a lot of patience or something you know but they that's their Commission though it's when they come on this earth the Holy Ghost is gone the only listen the only people with the Holy Ghost when we leave is empty prophets in the whole world talk about demonic powers coming in and trying to kill them there's no bribe there there's no word to keep them except for two people out of seven billion people will see now we've got I'm going to just say we've got several million bribed around the world so we kind of keep a little white brother Larry around the earth but what if we're going to people in one little place called Israel we'll have the Holy Ghost and then which of course with no 144,000 will but that's why the whole the whole place is gonna cave in on them but that God's got to save them until the time I didn't read the rest of it but what happens at the end remember God kind of does like you did Jobe he said oh you know I'm gonna withdraw a little bit cuz he's gonna die they're gonna die but they're gonna resurrect back up and they're gonna go over another dimension and then that's what we're gonna look at in just a little while maybe next we're not next Sunday but the two prophets are that seal now what time we'll make a comment here and then we'll close musicians go in come brother branham said when the sixth seal I read it next Sunday when the sixth seal open he had to get up and walk out of the room something open to that prophet that he had not seen before that those two prophets were that seal all right I'm just gonna leave that with him we'll talk about a little bit later but he come to a realization that it takes a prophet to open the seal we know the prophets the Lord Jesus Christ but he needed an outlet or a conduit called william branham to open the seals amen hey the seventh seal preached to other cells on the earth and nobody got it okay now we had a little prophet come and he got it and he give it to us now we got to get it so who's going to get it man one more time who's gonna get it okay confession let's stand confession you confess you show bro wait that makes no if you know who the real I am is you're not saying you the human person you're saying you the Holy Ghost that you have in your soul what was singing Louise plays 98 in the spiral book let's sing song god bless you thank you again for what you did this weekend we'll have I'm sure we'll have lots of chances to do it again let's just sing a song just remember before we get started helmet Billy this six sale when it opens it's like something's never been on this earth before but now when it happened to Jesus when Jesus come to a place we know where there was an earthquake we know that the Sun darkened right mill today Sun became black there was an earthquake there was a lot of things happen that was one man but when a collective body does it this earth has got a shape because we're connected to this earth and it's got a shake when those millions break that barrier of that dimension into this dimension and then we're changed in the moment there's something gonna happen to this earth but something's got to happen to this earth first [Music] Lord is coming back to earth again take it to it Oh Lord is coming by to earth again yes our Lord is coming back to earth again Satan will be bound up thousand ears will have no temper then after Jesus shall come back to earth again Jesus coming back will be the answer to our soaring crime for the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the earth the sea and Scott God shall take away all sickness and the suffers tears will dry when our Savior shall come back to earth again Oh Lord is coming again he's here oh yes our Lord is coming by toward the gate Satan will be bound a thousand years will have no temple even after Jesus shall come back to earth again oh yes the ransom of the Lord shall come to Zion then with joy and it all is holy mountain nothing hurts our shall destroy perfect peace shall reign and every heart love without a Lord after Jesus shall combine let's take the last verse then the sin and sorrow pain and depth of this dark world shall cease in a glorious reign with Jesus of a thousand years of peace all the earth is groaning crying for that day of sweet release for Jesus to come back to earth again Oh yes our Lord coming my torch again and we'll be found a thousand years will have no pimp through them after Jesus shall come back birth again you know under the revelation that they had when they wrote this song that's right but we know he's not coming he's here and we're not waiting for him to come back to earth again yeah we're waiting for the physical man but that physical man cannot come back to this earth until he's changed your body and my body and we go to a wedding supper we come back to earth see there's that one thing was well when Jesus comes back listen you can't see him without seeing us you can't see him without seeing us see that's the mystery in the end time it's the bride is she and she is him she has made manifest in another form called Jesus Christ Jesus coming back will be the answer to Earth's soaring cry for the knowledge of the Lord we know that's all gonna happen but what about now what about now there's not a millennium ever gonna happen until me and you take a body change will not happen cannot happen it's like brother Brown said Jesus was barred from coming out of the tomb right by scripture that was the bar there that said you had to be in the earth three days and three nights or whatever it was same way with me and you came to millennium - until the bride takes the body change steps over in another dimension let's God and I mean let's man wipe this thing off it'll be it'll be man's battle that want to be man's battle then we'll come back into millennium and we'll be able to just enjoy but really that's not our home that's not our house that millenium temple it's not our house that whole thousand years is not ours it's an allotted piece of time for the Jews to learn what they missed learn about what they miss sure they knew about amen they know about the temple they know what this thing is right here but they gonna meet the person that that was all about and then they're not just gonna see one person they're gonna say all y'all we say yeah we got the same mind he's got if you need an answer to a question just ask for Louise he'll tell you about that temple you ain't got me don't find Jesus we just all a bunch of low Jesus's around here seeing then at that thousand years over they're gonna get a surprise hey man they're gonna get a surprise Satan's going to be totally destroyed and there's gonna be a city come out from somewhere it's gonna materialize on a mountain read your future home I love that message that pyramid city pushed well the mountains gonna push up and they ain't gonna be a city coming up out of the ground it's a mountain then the city's gonna sit on top of it which will be me and you now that is our
