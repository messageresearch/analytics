[24:04] pieces I never heard that message but
[24:06] when brother Dale was preaching
[24:09] on Revelation 5 the throne I think part

[24:32] for days and then what happened was one
[24:37] day I was
[24:40] uh got to had to go to work I work at
[24:42] 6:00 and I heard brother way and I'm
[24:45] fall asleep and I fall asleep and all a
[24:48] sudden I heard somebody say hey wake
[24:51] up
[24:54] said good grief 15 minutes come on oh
[24:58] that's that's and I woke up that's
[25:02] that's your ringtone now that's my
[25:03] ringtone now anyway so now here's here's
[25:07] the thing I just this is how God worked
[25:10] so here I'm coming up with the message
[25:12] coming up with the message I'll come to
[25:14] Bob black and Bob black is freaking
[25:18] here's the daughter of the son of
[25:21] man and I looked at that and I looked at
[25:24] this it was snatching pieces Yen right
[25:28] there right there and I said oh looking
[25:31] I'm coming like this it didn't da on me
[25:33] but when he pointed this and there it is
[25:36] matching peace that's right so I just
[25:38] want to leave that with you
[25:46] guys the whole story to that is he
[25:48] started in
[25:49] 2015 um and we didn't know anything
[25:52] about it he was doing it in
[25:55] secret but he presented it to to his
[25:57] hard-headed I mean his
[25:59] sons amen he says and they're like no we
[26:03] don't see none of that no we don't see
[26:05] none of that and then all of a sudden
[26:07] they saw some of that Dad just kept
[26:09] being persistent Hey listen to this
[26:12] watch that and now they now they watch
[26:14] my color code
[26:17] shirt yeah brother brother Richard say
[26:20] Hey Brother way preached in a red shirt
[26:21] go listen to that one or a blue shirt go
[26:24] listen to that one so but now they're
[26:26] all here and that's kind of why the Ohio
[26:28] group
[26:29] is
[26:31] here because of him because of the
[26:36] Lord there was a desire in a man's heart
[26:40] he wanted to know more right not saying
[26:44] anything about where he came from
[26:46] absolutely he just left that church and
[26:48] just
[26:49] disappeared and but he wanted to know
[26:52] truth not that they weren't preaching
[26:54] truth he wanted more
[26:56] truth he asked God he said and God said
[26:58] I'm going reveal the seals to you well
[27:00] he can't reveal the seals to you just
[27:01] sitting at home so when he got on the
[27:04] internet and saw all people weren't
[27:05] preaching then you know brother Dale has
[27:07] been preaching the seal since 1982 so I
[27:09] mean that's you know to us it's I hate
[27:12] to say this but to us it's just
[27:14] common because we hear it all the time
[27:17] but to somebody from the outside that
[27:18] hears it it's like man we never heard
[27:21] this before so so he he finally got his
[27:25] sons to to pay attention and his and his
[27:29] daughter and uh that's where they're at
[27:31] now so it's good to have uh good to have
[27:34] a daddy that stood with the word of God
[27:36] and and you know what he claimed his
[27:37] kids just like just like all of us are
[27:39] claiming our kids and and he claimed his
[27:41] kids they were out in the world all
[27:43] right yeah they were out in the world
[27:45] and he claimed them and then here
[27:47] they've come in and now his son's a
[27:49] pastor of a church
[27:55] so also now Sister m
[27:59] MSA to fit the puzzle together sister
[28:02] Melissa comes from the outside you know
[28:04] and she comes into this group of people
[28:06] and she just accepts the message with
[28:08] open arms and and she's just a part of
[28:11] the church and and part of the body of
[28:14] Christ and and and come on up here but
[28:17] as you come up here Franklin stand up
[28:21] brother that is Sister Tabitha's
[28:26] brother
[28:30] for those of you that went to Ohio with
[28:32] us remember I baptized his
[28:35] son in the at the in the Lake Erie and
[28:39] then he was standing close by and I
[28:42] could feel it and he could feel it but
[28:44] he just didn't it wasn't the right time
[28:46] and and and then well brother Isaac
[28:49] baptized him not too long ago in the
[28:51] name of the Lord
[28:56] Jesus
[28:59] he drove 10 hours yesterday to get here
[29:01] last
[29:02] night he's turned around driving back
[29:05] home tonight just to be
[29:13] here how am I supposed to follow
[29:16] that you can you're a nurse you've seen
[29:20] wor oh yes uh again I'm sister Melissa
[29:24] I'm Elisha's wife and like he said I was
[29:26] just I married into a wonderful family I
[29:29] really did
[29:30] um uh and yes I've I've just came in uh
[29:35] in 2020 um I was not raised a Christian
[29:39] I was not raised in the message and U
[29:42] like brother Michael was talking about
[29:44] it would have been vital to have a
[29:46] family and be raised in a home and
[29:48] brought up in a Christian home um and
[29:51] you really don't know what you didn't
[29:52] have until you find out what you do have
[29:54] so I tell Elisha every day how great
[29:57] grateful I am that just to be able to
[30:00] see a family that was raising the
[30:01] message and thank Brother Richard every
[30:03] day for that for giving me a husband
[30:06] that was raised the message and he's
[30:07] just so you know in love with Christ and
[30:10] it's really what attracted me to him was
[30:12] his love for Christ and and family and
[30:16] um uh
[30:19] so um so since 2020 I've been you know
[30:23] growing and learning and uh the Lord's
[30:25] been so good to me all my life really
[30:28] just never really not I never really
[30:29] knew that I've been through so much in
[30:31] life and I'm just like how am I here now
[30:33] and I learn it was just through the
[30:35] grace of God he was he was bringing me
[30:36] to a place and uh um so so yeah he
[30:41] mentioned I am a nurse I work for the
[30:43] Cleveland Clinic I don't know if
[30:44] anybody's heard of that it's a major
[30:46] corporation it's a um I even wrote it
[30:49] down here so
[30:50] it's um a
[30:52] 6,665 bed Health System um and they have
[30:56] 22 hospitals uh all over the world
[30:59] mostly in Ohio Vegas Abu Dhabi things
[31:03] like that so it's it's it's major it's a
[31:05] big Corporation it's it's very
[31:06] intimidating to work for a place like
[31:09] this you kind of just you're just a
[31:10] little peon in their system you know you
[31:12] just work for them and um never really
[31:15] feel like you have a voice you're just
[31:16] part of
[31:17] something um but I love my job I'm a
[31:20] nurse in the O and uh a lot of strong
[31:24] personalities in the O I mean surgeons
[31:27] uh staff members things like that so I
[31:29] kind of just you know come in work you
[31:32] know try not to cause any waves or any
[31:35] issues or anything like that um but uh
[31:38] since 2020 you know as my faith has been
[31:40] growing I never really thought to bring
[31:43] you know push your faith on others so
[31:46] you know people have noticed the change
[31:47] at work and it's not been easy I've had
[31:50] some things said to me and you know to
[31:52] try to discourage me or you know I was I
[31:56] was a completely different person before
[31:58] you know I gave my life to the Lord so
[32:00] it's hard to see others and and and I
[32:03] I've battled with you know and I've
[32:04] talked to my husband I've talked to my
[32:06] sisters about how you know I would love
[32:08] for for them to see Christ in me and
[32:10] it's been more recent than not because
[32:12] I've been stepping in faith and and not
[32:15] caring what others think of me and just
[32:17] pushing forward pushing through amen um
[32:20] and this year it it's interesting how
[32:23] they place people in your in your life
[32:24] so I mean I have sister Tabitha who's an
[32:27] amazing amazing uh person to lean on and
[32:31] um our uh her nieces is and nephews as
[32:34] well um but her niece was getting a job
[32:37] and she was really excited about it a
[32:39] care a caregiving job Kina she was I
[32:41] think she came down here before too and
[32:44] um she we were having a conversation
[32:46] with the sisters and you know she looked
[32:48] at me and she's like sister what do you
[32:50] what do you wear to you know what do you
[32:51] wear to work and I never really thought
[32:54] about it I was you know I would just go
[32:55] to work wear my uniform I had at work
[32:57] work it's what they gave us it's what
[32:58] they provided there was no other options
[33:00] and it was a scrub top and scrub pants
[33:04] and she's like oh she thought that I
[33:06] wore you know a scrub skirt cuz she had
[33:08] pulled some out that she had bought and
[33:09] I'm like you know I never really thought
[33:11] to ask my boss about this or anything so
[33:14] it was on my heart and then me and
[33:16] Tabitha talked about it and I said well
[33:18] how could I you know how could I go to a
[33:20] a place like this that nobody is wearing
[33:23] scrub skirts nobody's doing these things
[33:24] and I was really nervous and she kind of
[33:27] helped me um write out a couple of
[33:29] things um um to kind of help my
[33:32] testimony and went to my director and
[33:35] spoke with her about it and she seen how
[33:36] nervous I was and how you know she's
[33:39] like this really means a lot to you and
[33:41] I'm like yeah I said but how could I do
[33:42] this this is not the you know the policy
[33:45] it doesn't say anywhere in the policy I
[33:46] have to wear what you guys provide and
[33:48] she's like well you know we'll find a
[33:49] way we'll talk to our HR department
[33:52] we'll talk to whoever we need to talk to
[33:54] and she was very very helpful she was
[33:56] very um kind to me I the response I got
[33:59] was not what I thought I was going to
[34:01] get um So within like a couple of weeks
[34:04] you know we we waited and I got the
[34:06] response back that I you know that I
[34:08] needed and she came she was so happy for
[34:10] me and she's like as long as you
[34:12] purchase them you know and bring them in
[34:14] and then we'll reimburse you and we'll
[34:18] allow you to wear them we have to have
[34:19] them laundered here because it's a
[34:20] sterile environment so we went through
[34:21] this whole um process and I was able to
[34:24] wear them and not realizing it you know
[34:27] you really don't see things until you're
[34:28] walking and but um walking to the
[34:30] hospital people are just staring you
[34:32] know at my you know at my dress they're
[34:34] like I didn't even think that was a
[34:35] thing and and others and we have a lot
[34:37] of Arabic women who don't know that they
[34:40] can wear you know wear the the skirts
[34:43] and dresses and things and so they had
[34:45] asked me and a lot of them come from
[34:47] other countries so they don't speak
[34:49] English well and you know just ask the
[34:51] question and oh can you help me so I've
[34:53] helped a couple
[34:54] of other women you know so
[34:58] um but yeah so you know we felt it was
[35:01] it was a nice wi to be able to just be
[35:03] able to walk in your faith at work as
[35:05] well you know all around 24/7 so uh so
[35:08] it was great so then um so and then more
[35:11] recently um I think it was like a couple
[35:13] weeks ago that we I received a a message
[35:16] an email I guess it had been something
[35:18] talked about among the different
[35:20] committees and different things in
[35:21] hospital and I got a message for an
[35:23] email from our laundry our director of
[35:25] our laundry services and he says um that
[35:28] there's actually myself and a couple of
[35:31] others who have asked to have their
[35:34] their skirts laundered um so it just
[35:37] perked some interest in some um you know
[35:39] within our management system and so he
[35:42] said well I guess I'm going to be
[35:43] ordering they're going to be providing
[35:46] the the scrub SKS for yeah they
[35:50] found so it's nice I mean we have it's I
[35:54] never really thought that I could help
[35:55] others I just wanted to walk in my I
[35:58] want to choose for myself but it's
[35:59] become you know an awareness that and uh
[36:04] so I guess eventually it's going to be a
[36:06] story for our magnet committee so I'll
[36:09] be able to share my story to the whole
[36:12] Cleveland kic system and it's 77,000
[36:15] caregivers
[36:19] so thank
[36:23] you ask are you going to testify she's
[36:29] like she must have lost that somewhere
[36:31] between there and here so but what a
[36:35] testimony God didn't just put it on one
[36:37] person now the whole system is affected
[36:40] by it so that's what the that's what the
[36:43] Lord will do if you'll stand for it
[36:45] he'll stand for you am man Sister Rose
[36:47] the same way you know she wears her
[36:49] skirts in there and then sister SAR and
[36:52] uh some of our Amy different ones we got
[36:55] sisters in here you stand for for the
[36:56] Lord he'll stand for
[36:58] you the Bible tells us to do these
[37:02] things all right now we're going to um
[37:05] we're going to bring brother Isaac out
[37:07] here in just a second but y'all stay
[37:08] right here cuz he's they're going to

[37:21] here and we sure pray for him he's like
[37:24] all of us he's going through trials and
[37:26] tribulations and you know the devil he
[37:27] turns every gun remember what brother
[37:30] Brown said you know why am I having
[37:32] these problems cuz I'm a Christian well
[37:34] you know what cuz Satan knows he lost a
[37:37] good
[37:40] guy Satan knows he lost a good soldier
[37:43] so he's going to try his best to get him
[37:45] back he's a good recruiter but we got a
[37:48] greater one it's called the Lord Jesus
[37:50] prise Lord so sister Tabitha thank you

[49:41] be and and I just lost it because I yes
[49:46] amen I thought about uh I thought about
[49:50] the queen you know Queen Esther when uh
[49:52] the king he sitting next to his wife and
[49:54] he said you you tell them you decree
[49:57] right so that's what it reminded me of
[49:59] and I said that's a wonderful testimony
[50:01] on top of the fact it was 77,000 people
[50:04] 77 is my favorite number cuz I was born
[50:07] in 77
[50:13] so but uh yeah just keep me in prayer
[50:16] I'm a little nervous you know it's it's
[50:18] a it's a great honor to be here um you
[50:20] know brother Wade had enough confidence
[50:22] to allow me to come here and speak to
[50:24] you today so um I I don't feel like I
[50:26] have any deep things and stuff like that
[50:28] but I'll just share what I what I can
[50:31] just in my heart you know so um it's a
[50:35] blessing to be here so um let me put
[50:37] this aside hopefully my Bible ain't
[50:39] upside down oh no we're
[50:41] good let me go here all right so we'll
[50:46] uh if you guys don't mind standing as we
[50:48] read the
[50:49] word all right let me get this plugged
[50:53] in
[50:54] here
[51:01] okay so to today a little bit we well
[51:04] let's open to Ephesians 3 Ephesians 3
[51:08] and we'll be speaking from 17 to 19
[51:10] today little bit and what I got up here
[51:13] is this um I was telling brother Wade I
[51:16] said uh hopefully none of y'all get
[51:17] offended but it's going to be a little
[51:18] bit about my testimony and how I had to
[51:20] deal with bitterness in my life so but
[51:24] uh pray that's all L of here today
[51:27] right but uh yeah so um and uh just so
[51:31] y'all know uh I was talking to brother
[51:33] Michael uh ear earlier my brother
[51:35] Michael was giving his mother some some
[51:37] roses some flowers you know and I went
[51:39] up to him I said man I I'll be giving my
[51:41] dad some flowers today
[51:43] so so so if you got a love one give him
[51:46] some flowers it don't do no good when
[51:48] they're gone
[51:50] right so uh before we read let's go to
[51:53] the word in prayer the Lord in prayer
[51:55] Heavenly Father Lord we come before you
[51:56] today Lord I I ask Lord that you move me
[51:59] out the way
[52:01] Lord Lord I just love you Lord I just so
[52:03] grateful for everything you've done for
[52:04] me Lord Lord I pray father that I stay
[52:07] right where you want me to be Lord we
[52:09] just love you and thank you Lord in
[52:10] Jesus name
[52:13] amen so here in Ephesians 33 it says
[52:16] here and I pray that you being rooted
[52:19] and established in love may have power
[52:23] together with all the Lord's holy people
[52:25] people to grasp how wide and long and
[52:28] high and deep is the love of Christ and
[52:30] to know this love that surpasses
[52:33] knowledge that you may be filled to the
[52:35] measure of all the fullness of God so
[52:39] you may have your seats um and I didn't
[52:42] even turn in my Bible forgive me I'm a
[52:44] rookie I know it's important to read
[52:46] from the Bible but I'm
[52:48] learning forgive me for that but uh um
[52:52] so what I want to speak about a little
[52:54] bit today I went around and around so I
[52:56] had months to prepare for today brother
[52:59] Wade said a long time ago you going to
[53:01] be coming up and I'm like wait you know
[53:04] what I mean but he he did tell me and so
[53:07] I had a long time to prepare so I
[53:09] probably got about three or four in here
[53:11] that it's like I'mma do this one n you
[53:14] ever had that and then the Lord just you
[53:17] ain't doing none of those you doing
[53:18] something
[53:21] else yeah so so just hopefully it all
[53:24] makes sense but
[53:25] I kind of want to talk about light today
[53:27] and U you know things like that and
[53:29] bitterness how that ties in you'll see
[53:30] here in a little bit but the Lord will
[53:32] tied in hopefully for us but you know
[53:34] bitterness is is sharpness of taste and
[53:37] it means lack of sweetness so think
[53:39] about that lack of sweetness you know so
[53:43] you know how this all started for me was
[53:45] um and I'll give a testimony here about
[53:47] my father but you know I was sitting at
[53:49] a I was getting ready to do an
[53:50] inspection on the house I'm an uh
[53:52] electrician by trade I'm an electrical
[53:55] safety Spectre now cuz I'm lazy now I
[53:57] don't like to work with my tools no more
[53:59] they're Rusty they're sitting in the
[54:00] garage somewhere but um I was sitting at
[54:03] an inspection and what happens is when a
[54:04] house has been down with power for more
[54:07] than so so much time they they pull the
[54:10] meter so there's no electricity there
[54:13] and then the house depletes real quick
[54:15] if there's no life in
[54:17] it it's amazing how when there's no life
[54:20] in a house it just wow it's just so so I
[54:23] was looking at this house and I was
[54:24] thinking about my life when I was young
[54:26] you know you know that's me you know and
[54:29] and and and I had bitterness and why did
[54:32] I have bitterness so I grew up in a
[54:33] chrisan in the message I was about N9
[54:35] months my dad came in and um you know
[54:38] growing up through it back then one with
[54:40] the parents the way uh
[54:42] Michael you hit it man you was right on
[54:45] it but back then you know the way the
[54:47] parents was raising the kids back then
[54:49] there was uh they they ruled with uh not
[54:52] so much love there wasn't too much love
[54:54] you know what I mean it was more the
[54:55] hammer you know what I mean and just the
[54:57] way it's going to be you know and some
[54:59] people caught soap in their mouths and
[55:00] you know all kinds of stuff we were
[55:03] talking about that last night yeah yeah
[55:05] look at Terence back he all proud of
[55:07] that but anyway
[55:10] so but uh so it a situation to where you
[55:13] know my my my dad was raised a certain
[55:15] way so you know he he only did the best
[55:17] he could at that time right and how he
[55:19] knew the racist so he come to the
[55:21] message and um man he's all ran and
[55:24] raving about things he would talk about
[55:25] things like that didn't even understand
[55:27] it but it's up there on the wall we had
[55:29] it on our wall since I was a baby real
[55:31] real big you know and um they didn't
[55:34] understand it at the time though you
[55:35] know it wasn't this appointed time right
[55:37] we know about the appointed time but so
[55:39] you know we grew up in a home where my
[55:41] dad was in the message he was doing
[55:42] prison Ministries and this and that and
[55:45] but I'll be honest I didn't see Christ
[55:47] in
[55:48] them you know I didn't see the hugs and
[55:52] help me with my homework and tuck me in
[55:53] bed at night and pray with me stuff like
[55:55] that you know so I grew up
[55:59] bitter I'll be honest I grew up bitter
[56:03] and so I says well if that's if that's
[56:05] God I don't I don't really want that you
[56:08] know what I mean so I went out into the
[56:10] world and um funny thing about it is is
[56:14] in high school 94 I met my wife we were
[56:16] dating in high school even though I was
[56:18] out in the world I was still talking to
[56:20] her about serpy the Lord this and that
[56:23] you know what I mean so it was kind of
[56:25] it was a kind of it it was it was
[56:27] amazing it really was but she accepted
[56:29] it very quickly and it's amazing when
[56:31] she gave her life to the Lord all the
[56:33] makeer everything was gone like I'm like
[56:36] wow I I there was no fight just gone I'm
[56:40] like that's good for me I picked the
[56:42] right one you know because she didn't
[56:45] she didn't war with a lot of things she
[56:46] was just very
[56:48] obedient and and that was that's another
[56:51] message I had but I won't go into that
[56:52] one but you know I asked the Lord one
[56:54] time I said what is Faith you know a lot
[56:56] of times preachers and people ministers
[56:58] will will try to express what is Faith
[57:01] and I could never grasp it I could never
[57:03] get it so one day the Lord just gave me
[57:05] another word to pair with it
[57:09] obedience so I said obedience so I
[57:11] started looking and I started seeing a
[57:14] trend was you know when you're
[57:18] obedient there is no laws there's no
[57:20] laws when you're obedient there's no
[57:23] laws so you know it's a situation to
[57:26] where I just needed a new
[57:28] spirit right cuz the spirit I was born
[57:30] with wasn't the right one so you know it
[57:33] was a situation where I started seeing
[57:34] these things and I want to preaching it
[57:36] I'm I got a lot of new people so we went
[57:39] from just the family to I want to say a
[57:43] solid 20 maybe 26 to 28 people right now
[57:46] which we started with about 13 it was
[57:48] just my family so yeah I got people
[57:50] calling me off the streets now like
[57:52] friends that I had I would hang out with
[57:54] the family at the barbecues they're
[57:56] calling me now like and they just dump
[57:59] on me they come to the house and they
[58:02] grown men with big muscles tatted up
[58:04] they sitting there crying then I start
[58:07] crying cuz I'm a I'm Hispanic so
[58:09] Hispanics we like to cry well not the
[58:12] cholos up in Mexico they don't cry too
[58:14] much but the ones up north we cry
[58:17] babies so you know I'm sitting here with
[58:20] you know these uh two there two two men
[58:22] I'm thinking about and they they come to
[58:24] me and and uh I dragged Franklin into it
[58:27] cuz Franklin gave his life to I'm all
[58:28] over the place but Franklin gave his
[58:30] life to the Lord recently and um I would
[58:33] talk to Franklin for
[58:35] years years his eyes are glaze over you
[58:38] can see it just falling right off how
[58:41] about the Browns yall know you guys got
[58:43] the Falcons up down down this
[58:46] way but uh so you know I would talk to
[58:50] Franklin for many years and uh and um it
[58:53] just just to no avail and then one day 2
[58:55] 2 3 2 3 in the morning me and my wife we
[58:57] get a a text and a phone
[59:00] call I love God that's all it said and
[59:03] I'm like confused looking at it and uh
[59:06] the next day I called him he's like the
[59:08] Lord visited me in my
[59:11] room now I want y'all to know we was
[59:13] down our way down here uh was it two
[59:15] years ago or a year ago was it two years
[59:17] AG years two years ago we were on the
[59:19] way down here to visit and my wife got
[59:21] the call he had a heart attack and died
[59:23] on the table twice
[59:26] he Flatline twice on that table and me
[59:28] and my wife we she started crying and
[59:30] know we prayed together in the car on
[59:31] the way here we were wondering it's turn
[59:33] back or not but we just said we'll just
[59:35] keep going but but uh anyways uh he's
[59:37] here
[59:38] today
[59:40] yeah and uh I I like for you to I would
[59:44] if it's a possible maybe the second
[59:45] service it be nice to have him up here
[59:47] and give his little testimony but um so
[59:50] you know now I can't he's always on my
[59:52] front porch now
[59:57] oh man so yeah one of those gentlemen
[59:59] going back to those gentlemen one of
[1:00:01] those gentlemen was at the house we were
[1:00:02] talking and uh Franklin just walks in
[1:00:05] you know it's his house right we love
[1:00:07] him so he just comes walking in he's
[1:00:08] like oh is it a bad time I said nope
[1:00:11] come on over here so I said you going to
[1:00:13] start working for the Lord too so we've
[1:00:15] been putting him to work uh his he helps
[1:00:17] me when when the these men come in he'll
[1:00:20] come over and we'll pray together with
[1:00:21] them and you know you know we want to
[1:00:23] try to get them to see and through this
[1:00:26] ministry here the most important thing
[1:00:28] is the new birth right through this
[1:00:31] ministry that's what we're learning it's
[1:00:33] not about the Deep things and all this
[1:00:35] and that it's just no let's get you up
[1:00:37] here to the Cross you got to realize you
[1:00:39] need a new spirit because them old skins
[1:00:41] you got they cracked they dried they
[1:00:44] ain't going to hold any kind of
[1:00:45] Revelation right so we got to get you we
[1:00:48] got to get you some new
[1:00:51] skins some new
[1:00:53] Nikes
[1:00:55] so yeah we uh so Franklin's learning now
[1:00:58] with me and uh he's he's great to have
[1:01:00] by my side and he keeps in context
[1:01:02] there's a lot going I didn't realize how
[1:01:03] much goes on with when being a
[1:01:05] pastor it's uh when brother brandom says
[1:01:08] you the ox of the team you the ox of the
[1:01:10] team you know what I mean and and it's a
[1:01:12] great thing it's a good thing the Lord
[1:01:14] saw fit that I can handle it and she he
[1:01:16] gave me a good support system with my
[1:01:18] wife so I always have my wife on my side
[1:01:21] you know what I mean and and um and
[1:01:23] things like that so we're learning we're
[1:01:25] growing together and and um it's nice
[1:01:28] when we can get away sometimes and and
[1:01:30] uh you know we get back to it and get in
[1:01:32] the grind so just keep me in prayer keep
[1:01:34] us in prayer that way but um so let's
[1:01:37] see if I can keep on going here y'all
[1:01:40] should have seen me like the last 24
[1:01:43] hours I'm like pacing around I didn't
[1:01:45] sleep last night I'm up praying I'm like
[1:01:47] all over the place and and I'm like Lord
[1:01:49] you know there some great people have
[1:01:51] stood behind this Pulpit you know so I
[1:01:53] feel like a a student I was telling
[1:01:55] brother Wade I'm I'm just a little
[1:01:57] student but anyways looking at this
[1:01:59] house you see the lack of warmth no life
[1:02:01] not inviting dead cold dark and
[1:02:04] something I want to kind of get into
[1:02:06] today into today was you know I didn't
[1:02:08] have light the Bible says here in John
[1:02:11] in fact let's go to John here John 1
[1:02:15] we'll go to it
[1:02:17] now let's see
[1:02:21] here in John 1 here it says
[1:02:24] and uh I know brother Way's been read
[1:02:26] reading this for a long time now he's
[1:02:28] been on a a series there but the
[1:02:30] wonderful series but in here at John 1
[1:02:33] Chapter 4 it says in him was
[1:02:36] life and the life was the light of men
[1:02:41] and the light shineth in the darkness
[1:02:44] and the Darkness comprehended it not so
[1:02:48] you know when you look at this house the
[1:02:50] problem is it doesn't have any life in
[1:02:52] it and if it it needs life to have light
[1:02:57] because life in it turns the light you
[1:02:59] don't commune with somebody in the dark
[1:03:01] right people come over to the house you
[1:03:03] invite them in you turn on the lights
[1:03:05] you know what I mean so so that and and
[1:03:08] I was thinking about light I've been
[1:03:09] pondering light lately and and they
[1:03:11] can't measure it they've tried to
[1:03:13] measure light but they can't all these
[1:03:15] scientists Einstein come up with
[1:03:17] relativity um I can say it this time I
[1:03:20] can never say that I'm all over the
[1:03:22] place but um and then um uh what's the
[1:03:26] other one
[1:03:27] uh no what's
[1:03:30] that no um
[1:03:32] sorry I'm
[1:03:34] sorry no there was there's another
[1:03:36] scientist that did um
[1:03:40] um uh ah well it'll come it'll come when
[1:03:44] if it needs to but anyway you got
[1:03:45] different scientists they get most of
[1:03:48] the puzzle but they don't get all of it
[1:03:50] God God makes them come up a little
[1:03:52] short you know what I mean cuz he gets
[1:03:53] all the glory
[1:03:55] Glory so but what they're not getting is
[1:03:58] that light and and what they're trying
[1:03:59] to measure is sitting in this room right
[1:04:03] now they're trying to measure it but
[1:04:05] they can't find it it's right in front
[1:04:07] of them when they go to the grocery
[1:04:08] store and they see a sister walking into
[1:04:11] a Walmart with a long dress on all right
[1:04:14] that's the light they're trying to
[1:04:15] measure but they can't find it you know
[1:04:17] so you know it's a situation to where um
[1:04:20] you know but but to get there but to get
[1:04:23] there right in your when you receive the
[1:04:25] new birth right there you push Satan out
[1:04:28] your soul the
[1:04:30] darkness now what I noticed about
[1:04:32] turning a light on when the light comes
[1:04:33] on it's effort the lights effortlessly
[1:04:36] it doesn't have to
[1:04:38] push it's just
[1:04:40] effortlessly you see what I'm saying so
[1:04:43] it it's a situation where the darkness
[1:04:45] it's like it's like a the best way to
[1:04:47] explain it to you is like a man floating
[1:04:48] in space you push him with your finger
[1:04:50] and he just keep going that's the
[1:04:52] darkness that light just come in in and
[1:04:55] the Darkness just have to go you could
[1:04:56] light a small little candle and that
[1:04:58] you'll see that light pushed to the Far
[1:04:59] Corners of the room you understand and
[1:05:02] so what God's trying to bring us to with
[1:05:04] with brother Wade's Min uh what he been
[1:05:06] ministering on the son of man what God's
[1:05:08] trying to bring us to is now that we
[1:05:10] have life in our
[1:05:11] soul we must push that Darkness out of
[1:05:14] our spirit realm
[1:05:17] right and so we push it out by what
[1:05:19] trials and you know I want more patience
[1:05:22] well you go down I was telling the group
[1:05:24] uh it's been a little while so I'm good
[1:05:26] now but I was going down the highway and
[1:05:29] this guy came up behind me at like 100
[1:05:31] mph so I'm like whoa I need to slide
[1:05:33] over a little bit so then I slid over
[1:05:35] and then he come in front of me and put
[1:05:36] his brakes on he brake checked me I'm
[1:05:39] like this man trying to kill me so I
[1:05:40] said you know what I'mma to pull up next
[1:05:42] to him I'm be like hey man let's pull
[1:05:43] over and talk about it so I was trying
[1:05:45] to get him to pull over so we could talk
[1:05:47] about it I said oh I can't do that so
[1:05:48] now I got to go back to the church and
[1:05:50] apologize so I went back to the church I
[1:05:53] this was like 3 months ago maybe so but
[1:05:56] the Lord was giving me a test on
[1:05:59] Temperance right and I'm not going I'm
[1:06:01] not going you know it's not something
[1:06:03] once you pass it you got it it's a
[1:06:06] constant right I heard brother Wade say
[1:06:08] years ago in one of his one of his
[1:06:10] things he said them lines should be
[1:06:11] going up and down I believe that I
[1:06:14] believe that cuz it's a constant you
[1:06:15] know so yeah so Temperance I'm like oh
[1:06:19] boy so yeah anyway I I I told my I told
[1:06:22] the Lord I said Lord if that man ever
[1:06:24] pulls up next to me I'm come on let's
[1:06:25] talk about I going to give you a hug I'm
[1:06:28] sorry you know what I mean but uh anyway
[1:06:30] so yeah he'll keep testing until you
[1:06:32] pass
[1:06:33] it and when he testing he go silent
[1:06:36] right when they give the test it's
[1:06:38] silence so you ain't got no help you on
[1:06:40] your own on this
[1:06:42] one but
[1:06:45] anyway so you know you know uh so you
[1:06:48] know speaking about bitterness and
[1:06:50] myself with my father when I was young
[1:06:52] and and just for the record
[1:06:54] he's my best friend now I love him I
[1:06:57] wouldn't trade him for nothing I
[1:07:00] wouldn't trade him for nothing because
[1:07:02] my dad is uh brother brownon preaches a
[1:07:05] message called
[1:07:07] oddballs my dad's an eyeball he really
[1:07:10] is he you know he'd be in in in
[1:07:13] congregations and you know never was
[1:07:15] voted for nothing or you know uh never
[1:07:18] invited over for nothing you know what I
[1:07:19] mean we was poor stuff like that but he
[1:07:22] loved the sing and all the we've gotten
[1:07:26] stuck Through The Years with all the uh
[1:07:27] eyeballs all all the Castaways and you
[1:07:30] see a you see a tread here Jesus he love
[1:07:33] hanging out with those type doesn't
[1:07:35] he oh yeah all the unres like brother
[1:07:42] Louise but uh so you know it's a
[1:07:45] situation to where you know my uh I had
[1:07:48] that bitterness in my life and you know
[1:07:50] holding grudges and resentment but you
[1:07:52] know the the Lord did put Brothers in
[1:07:53] the church church he put mentors in the
[1:07:55] church at the time they kind of seen
[1:07:57] that and they took me under the wings
[1:07:59] and they talked to me and and um uh they
[1:08:02] were pretty rough on me too but it was a
[1:08:04] different kind of love I guess cuz I
[1:08:06] remember one time I was up in the club
[1:08:08] me and my wife we was up in the club and
[1:08:11] uh we like to dance you know Spanish
[1:08:13] people love to dance but we was up in
[1:08:14] there dancing I'm swinging her
[1:08:18] around you know what I mean stuff like
[1:08:20] that and and I get a phone call and and
[1:08:24] I don't know do some of you guys know
[1:08:25] brother Yvonne he's he's a you know
[1:08:27] brother yvon okay yeah he come he come
[1:08:29] from lra but he got a church in in New
[1:08:30] York City right now so he's got it he's
[1:08:33] got the rough ones out there New York
[1:08:36] City but uh so anyway he had called me
[1:08:39] but I was compelled to answer it like I
[1:08:42] had to answer it you know knowing this
[1:08:44] is a brother from church and I'm like
[1:08:46] Dan looking at the phone but I am I said
[1:08:50] hello brother Vine he said yeah he said
[1:08:53] you know what Isaac
[1:08:54] he's like I've been in my prayer room
[1:08:55] all day and you've been doing nothing
[1:08:57] but tormenting me that's how they dealt
[1:09:00] with me straight up they but I like that
[1:09:03] that's how the Lord knows how I like I
[1:09:05] like something straight up if I'm in
[1:09:07] eror just tell me you don't beat around
[1:09:09] and and then let's fix it so I'm one of
[1:09:12] them guys I don't you know the back then
[1:09:14] I had a grudge from against my father
[1:09:16] but what I'm going to now is the Lord
[1:09:18] deliver me from that where where that's
[1:09:20] where I'm headed but so it was a
[1:09:21] situation to where um he called me he he
[1:09:24] was saying these things and I sobered up
[1:09:26] I sobered up immediately I grabbed her
[1:09:28] hand we went home and I just pondered
[1:09:30] but I had situations like that
[1:09:32] throughout my life people call people
[1:09:34] text right at the right moments you know
[1:09:36] and it was the Lord that he just stuck
[1:09:38] in there for me and and he didn't give
[1:09:40] up on me you know I had a brother tell
[1:09:42] me one time he said you know brother
[1:09:44] Isaac God's only obligated to call you
[1:09:46] once right and that makes him just think
[1:09:49] about that but for 38 years of my life
[1:09:54] he just kept wooing and just kept laying
[1:09:56] in there and just kept he was so
[1:09:58] patience and long when I read scriptures
[1:10:00] like longsuffering I that's my guy right
[1:10:03] so it's a situation to where you know
[1:10:05] he's stuck in there so you know it's Our
[1:10:07] obligation to stick in there for others
[1:10:09] right that's where I'm headed that's
[1:10:11] that's where I'm headed you know if I
[1:10:13] can get there but but here's a picture
[1:10:15] here this was me you know what I mean
[1:10:19] the Lord was dealing with me when I was
[1:10:20] 18 but I had that that bitterness my
[1:10:23] Foundation was
[1:10:25] right you know what I'm saying when
[1:10:27] you're serving the lord you got to get
[1:10:29] it when that light comes on it it
[1:10:31] Darkness has to go and what I'm trying
[1:10:34] to say is you know we're coming up
[1:10:36] through the spirit realm because we're
[1:10:37] trying to take a body change right
[1:10:39] that's the goal the Bible says there
[1:10:40] will be something that will take a body
[1:10:42] change that's us I believe that so you
[1:10:45] know it's a situation where um I had
[1:10:47] something there I had to go back you
[1:10:49] know what happens is I'm sorry I'm sorry
[1:10:51] this is the only one good one I could
[1:10:53] find the guy I ain't got a shirt on so
[1:10:54] please forgive me um but you know it's a
[1:10:57] situation where sometimes God's he's
[1:10:59] going to take you back you got to go
[1:11:01] back to that you got to we had a men's
[1:11:03] meeting recently and um what was on my
[1:11:07] heart was you know sometimes we as uh
[1:11:09] brothers and sisters we have hurts right
[1:11:12] you got hurts you got things that's
[1:11:14] hurting you well that's going to that's
[1:11:16] an imped on your
[1:11:19] growth that's an imped on your growth
[1:11:22] right think about it Jesus Christ was
[1:11:25] hurt they beat him spit on him called
[1:11:28] them names he opened up not his
[1:11:31] mouth right but we quick to say well you
[1:11:34] you you gave me Injustice or you did
[1:11:37] this to me or I'm not you know and then
[1:11:40] that's the impedance on your
[1:11:42] growth the best thing to do is free
[1:11:45] yourself from that yeah you know so
[1:11:48] that's what I did right that's what I
[1:11:51] did I said I told Brother wait I going
[1:11:52] be speaking about bitterness
[1:11:54] but it's going to be me so I hope your
[1:11:55] church don't get bitter towards me cuz
[1:11:57] they thinking it's them no it's not I'm
[1:11:59] just this is my testimony this is what
[1:12:01] what happened with me right so you know
[1:12:03] it's a situation to where uh I was going
[1:12:05] across the bridge uh when I was 18 and
[1:12:08] we got a bridge we got a couple Bridges
[1:12:09] there but we were going the Henderson
[1:12:11] Bridge and the spirit of the Lord came
[1:12:13] in the in the vehicle the sh of

[1:12:34] voice came again go apologize to your
[1:12:36] father and I said yes Lord I went home I
[1:12:40] walked in the house I was crying by then

[1:13:34] Spanish is uh have respects for your
[1:13:37] elders right you know what I mean it was
[1:13:40] always it was but I've learned through
[1:13:42] the years it ain't really like that you
[1:13:44] know you have respect for them as long
[1:13:46] as they're on the word when they get off
[1:13:48] the word you got to stay with the word
[1:13:50] so now you got a decision to make what
[1:13:52] you going to do right right but uh
[1:13:55] anyway so yeah with my dad it was a
[1:13:57] situation I went home and apologized to
[1:13:59] Dad and I said Dad I love you I'm sorry
[1:14:00] for being the son that I had through the
[1:14:02] years and I was a knucklehead I was a
[1:14:04] knucklehead I always went against him my
[1:14:07] brother my brother was the good
[1:14:09] son he was a good boy he always worked
[1:14:12] on the house with them the cars I was
[1:14:14] always out with my friends causing
[1:14:15] troubles and stuff but but uh you know I
[1:14:18] went back and apologized but you know
[1:14:20] that thing left that
[1:14:21] day and it's never been
[1:14:23] B Never Been
[1:14:26] b now now now it's a situation to where
[1:14:30] if I'm I'm at odds with someone I can't
[1:14:33] sleep I can't pray you know um I I'll be
[1:14:37] honest brother Ebenezer that's your name
[1:14:39] brother yeah brother Ebenezer so what
[1:14:42] happened was I was telling brother Wade
[1:14:43] about it what happened was a year AG was
[1:14:45] it a year ago we were here for
[1:14:47] Valentine's we were here and and me and
[1:14:49] brother Ebenezer we walked past each
[1:14:50] other we made eye contact but I didn't
[1:14:52] stop
[1:14:54] I didn't stop to shake your hand brother
[1:14:56] and that ate at me this whole year I
[1:14:58] said I can't wait to get down and shake
[1:14:59] your hand that's why I shook your hand
[1:15:01] does it make sense
[1:15:03] now so but you know we made eye contact
[1:15:06] and I didn't stop that's not you know
[1:15:09] that wasn't good so I'm glad I was able
[1:15:11] to make that right
[1:15:13] brother um so you know it's a situation
[1:15:16] to where I was looking at what brother
[1:15:18] brandom says you know he's talking about
[1:15:19] The Crow and the Dove and he talks he
[1:15:23] always Associates G of bitterness you
[1:15:27] guys notice that when you're in your
[1:15:28] studies with brother brandom there he
[1:15:30] always talks about a g of
[1:15:31] bitterness and you know and I was just
[1:15:34] pondering it and and I started thinking
[1:15:36] about it and I'm going all the way down
[1:15:37] to the end of my message here now but
[1:15:39] you know
[1:15:41] Jesus Satan always came to T Jesus
[1:15:44] Satan's Darkness we know that right and
[1:15:47] he always came to tempt Jesus but even
[1:15:49] unto his death he tried to give him a
[1:15:51] gall of
[1:15:53] bitterness try to put it in his mouth
[1:15:57] but he wouldn't accept it you know and
[1:15:59] that's for us right Satan tries to come
[1:16:03] against us and we got little schisms in
[1:16:05] the church right now I'm preaching
[1:16:06] against schisms in the church that's
[1:16:08] where I'm at because I want the body
[1:16:11] change and as long as you got schisms in
[1:16:13] the church and I don't like the color he
[1:16:15] got on or I don't like how he did this
[1:16:16] or that this we ain't going to get
[1:16:19] there it's not about the secrets and the
[1:16:22] Deep things it's about me dying to
[1:16:26] myself and preferring those next to me
[1:16:29] and so that's where I'm at right now so
[1:16:33] if y'all want to know where my thoughts
[1:16:34] are and where we're at with the churches
[1:16:35] I'm just trying to you know uh we had a
[1:16:37] situation with uh um gossip coming to
[1:16:40] church recently just in a little church
[1:16:44] it got the Sheep all
[1:16:45] skittish all the Sheep are skittish and
[1:16:48] you can sense it you know brother Wade
[1:16:50] and brother Samuel I'm sure they can
[1:16:51] sense it and I don't I don't know some
[1:16:53] of these ministers here when when you
[1:16:54] preach to people can you sense sometimes
[1:16:56] things just falling flat or or you can
[1:16:58] sense nervousness or things okay so yeah
[1:17:01] well I'm learning I'm learning these
[1:17:02] things but you know it's a situation
[1:17:04] where I'm like I got to get to the
[1:17:05] bottom of it cuz this is going to kill
[1:17:07] the church well we got to the bottom of
[1:17:09] it you know we got it out and we're
[1:17:11] moving forward now and um we're just
[1:17:14] grateful and now I'm not saying it ain't
[1:17:15] going to try to come back
[1:17:17] right that Bird's gonna fly over but as
[1:17:21] long we just keep swatting at it you
[1:17:23] keep swatting at that thing you hit it
[1:17:24] with the
[1:17:25] word and don't let it make Roost but uh
[1:17:29] you know so yeah that's uh kind of
[1:17:31] what's going on right now but let me see
[1:17:33] if I got something
[1:17:34] here usually what I do at at home is I
[1:17:37] just read they they get I know they get
[1:17:40] a little weary on it but I'm just so um
[1:17:43] there's a little more freedom I guess
[1:17:45] and you know I'm just I'm trying not to
[1:17:47] look uh like a
[1:17:49] rookie but uh
[1:17:53] no there's uh there's been people
[1:17:55] praying and fasting for this for this
[1:17:57] day and I'm just grateful for that you
[1:17:59] know what I mean and and and and and I'm
[1:18:01] very appreciate appreciative of those
[1:18:04] things but you know when I was looking
[1:18:05] at brother Brown talks about Ravens and
[1:18:07] and doves and stuff did you know Raven
[1:18:09] and Crow they can hold a grudge up to 5
[1:18:12] years they know faces they know language
[1:18:16] our language and they can hold a
[1:18:19] grudge but a dove doesn't imagine that
[1:18:23] brother brandom talks about us being uh
[1:18:26] like a dove
[1:18:27] right now you see why you know brother
[1:18:30] BR talks about if if if if Jesus was
[1:18:32] walking and he had the spirit of the
[1:18:34] wolf that Dove would have never came and
[1:18:36] sat he needed to have that Spirit of a
[1:18:38] dove gentle sweet right and so that's
[1:18:43] where we must come to we got there's
[1:18:45] there's no way around it we got to get
[1:18:48] we got to we got to die folks you got to
[1:18:50] become a sacrificial lamb
[1:18:53] every
[1:18:55] day and but but the reward is great cuz
[1:18:58] he's going to rise you up make you Kings
[1:19:00] and priest right and you'll and you'll
[1:19:03] judge the you'll judge the Earth but
[1:19:06] first of all there's work to be done we
[1:19:08] must judge ourselves and we got to push
[1:19:10] that Darkness not only out of our soul
[1:19:12] but out of our spirit realm once we get
[1:19:15] that out our spirit realm and we're
[1:19:16] we're good to go and won't be much time
[1:19:19] I was telling brother Wade I believe
[1:19:21] this and and you can correct it if
[1:19:23] you're if I'm wrong brother way but I
[1:19:24] was telling him yesterday I honestly
[1:19:26] believe that the fivefold ministry will
[1:19:29] be done away with when the dead in
[1:19:31] Christ
[1:19:33] rise there'll be nothing else left we
[1:19:36] done merged the
[1:19:39] dimensions you know what I mean so and
[1:19:41] in that and in that I also believe that
[1:19:44] God's going to show Satan one full moon
[1:19:48] cycle 30 to 40
[1:19:50] days that in time I had a wife a bride
[1:19:55] that defeated
[1:19:57] you so you take it for what it is you
[1:20:00] check in what your pastor but that's
[1:20:01] what I believe that because I I was I
[1:20:04] was pondering and questioning why did
[1:20:05] Jesus say 30 why did why why was it 3040
[1:20:08] days well according to the Jewish
[1:20:10] calendar they're big on moon
[1:20:13] cycles every 30 days that's their that's
[1:20:16] their calendar so why what what does the
[1:20:19] Jewish have to do with us well you know
[1:20:20] there's types right we know there
[1:20:22] there's types but yeah I believe that so
[1:20:24] and then after that it's going home
[1:20:27] time I was telling brother Wade in there
[1:20:29] I said man I said as nervous as I am
[1:20:31] right now I'm so glad I met you I'm so
[1:20:33] glad that in God's
[1:20:35] thoughts that he had brother Boyd he had
[1:20:39] brother brother Wade all the brothers
[1:20:41] here and uh what's your brother dhy is
[1:20:43] that brother dhy brother dhy okay
[1:20:46] brother D with brother Kylie brother
[1:20:49] Kylie you know what God's thoughts he
[1:20:52] says is I'm going to have all these Fine
[1:20:53] Brothers
[1:20:54] together and we'll be we won't be
[1:20:57] separated Brother
[1:20:58] Anderson and brother
[1:21:00] John brother John man you been you been
[1:21:03] hitting me with some Financial uh yeah I
[1:21:06] like it man keep keep hitting
[1:21:09] us you know we don't think of things
[1:21:11] like that oh no man before we go home we
[1:21:14] got to have every we got to have light
[1:21:16] on
[1:21:17] everything there can't be no darkness in
[1:21:20] your wallet you can't be hiding no you
[1:21:21] know no bills
[1:21:23] you got to shed light on all I'm paid up
[1:21:26] all right let's
[1:21:28] go you know so um what's the
[1:21:32] time okay all right all right Lord just
[1:21:35] keep helping me 2 Thessalonians 28 it
[1:21:38] says for the mystery of iniquity doth
[1:21:40] already work only he who now lth will
[1:21:43] let until he be taken out of the way and
[1:21:47] then shall the wicked be revealed you
[1:21:49] see that how's the wicked GNA be
[1:21:51] revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[1:21:54] with the spirit of his mouth and shall
[1:21:57] destroy with the brightness of his
[1:22:00] coming you see that's why it's important
[1:22:03] for us to shed the light on for for the
[1:22:06] spirit of God to be in us right through
[1:22:08] the new birth us working up through the
[1:22:11] stature up in the spirit realm you know
[1:22:13] and that's important for us to have that
[1:22:15] the new spirit you know I I had uh
[1:22:18] painted a picture for the guys uh there
[1:22:20] at back at home I had a a high way on
[1:22:23] the highway I had 50 mph which it
[1:22:26] probably should be about 75 mph or 70
[1:22:28] mph but I said that's the letter see the
[1:22:31] letter the letter kth right but the
[1:22:34] spirit gives life and so what I had was
[1:22:36] I had two cars driving one at 70 M
[1:22:39] obeying the speed limit right that's the
[1:22:42] new birth that's the new spirit your
[1:22:45] obedience in obedience right there's no
[1:22:47] law to to a person that's in obedience
[1:22:50] but then I had a guy speeding down with
[1:22:52] with his nice little red convertible
[1:22:54] going 100 mph see that man's going to
[1:22:56] wind up killing somebody killing himself
[1:22:59] right so we must have a new
[1:23:03] spirit so it says here uh it says and
[1:23:08] and brother brandom speaking here says
[1:23:09] and a dove I want to tell you something
[1:23:11] a dove does not find water for a bath
[1:23:14] think about that you don't have to go
[1:23:16] searching for the Holy Spirit out here
[1:23:18] somewhere it's in you God gave you
[1:23:22] everything you need to grow and for
[1:23:25] cleansing right it says here it says did
[1:23:29] you ever pick up a little D rub your
[1:23:31] hand over him he's oily there's
[1:23:33] something from the inside comes out and
[1:23:35] keeps him clean oh my his body's oil
[1:23:38] from from oil from the inside coming out
[1:23:41] amen I don't want to get started on that
[1:23:44] I'll get off my subject but he keeps his
[1:23:46] body his feathers his garments clean
[1:23:48] inside and out now you know you see here
[1:23:51] this garments he keeps him clean inside
[1:23:53] and out he was he's wearing white
[1:23:54] garments but he's white from the inside
[1:23:56] out you know we just went through I was
[1:23:58] telling brother way we just went through
[1:23:59] the church he just we just finished them
[1:24:02] up and uh in Le O deia the the sheep
[1:24:05] from that region Beed black
[1:24:08] wool and so Leo de sea was very rich so
[1:24:12] in those times they wore
[1:24:14] black and and it it's very fitting
[1:24:17] because it's a situation where I
[1:24:19] actually know an architect who's very
[1:24:20] wealthy he all he vers is
[1:24:23] black because it's a it's a symbol of
[1:24:26] status you know what I mean and so U
[1:24:29] that's why God challenges him a white ra
[1:24:31] a white rment because they wore black
[1:24:34] back then maybe when you guys get into
[1:24:36] it I don't know way said he was going to
[1:24:38] be going through but uh yeah I found it
[1:24:41] interesting too hopefully I'm not
[1:24:42] telling too much about it but I found it
[1:24:44] interesting is you know the the Bible
[1:24:47] says you're lukewarm right well what
[1:24:50] happened was they ran out of water they
[1:24:52] had money cuz they were the banking
[1:24:54] system they had money but they didn't
[1:24:56] have water so hopis a city above them
[1:25:00] hopis had a hot spring and a city below
[1:25:03] them colasse where the book of
[1:25:05] Colossians was written they had a Cold
[1:25:07] Spring and so what they did was they
[1:25:09] helped Leo de out by pumping water to
[1:25:12] Leo deia by the time it got there it was
[1:25:15] lukewarm and and and what happened was
[1:25:18] calcium were build up so now became
[1:25:20] toxic so a lukewarm chrisan
[1:25:22] sitting in the pews is the
[1:25:26] toxic understand that so I leave that
[1:25:29] with
[1:25:30] you you clean that up no but you know
[1:25:34] but listen we should be we should always
[1:25:36] be looking at ourselves right or
[1:25:39] self-reflecting is good the problem is
[1:25:42] we we look at other people's mirrors
[1:25:43] what you dressing what you doing you
[1:25:45] know what I mean look at ourselves now
[1:25:47] is the time for us to judge ourselves
[1:25:48] according to the scriptures so that you
[1:25:51] may be a good judge
[1:25:53] when the time comes right there'll be
[1:25:55] nothing you know the Lord he going to be
[1:25:57] he Lord the Lord going to be he's just
[1:26:00] going to be so excited and happy he's
[1:26:01] going to be looking over there you did
[1:26:02] good look at you oh yeah you judged it
[1:26:05] just like I judged it Adam named the
[1:26:07] animals just like he would name them
[1:26:10] right so he's going to look at you and
[1:26:12] say that's exactly that you get a A+ on
[1:26:14] that I didn't see too many A+ is growing
[1:26:17] up but hopefully I'll get a
[1:26:20] A+ yeah I was telling somebody I
[1:26:22] graduated with a 1.8

[1:28:10] there at one time and we sat there and
[1:28:12] uh this gentleman that was one of my
[1:28:14] bullies he was sitting right over kitty
[1:28:16] corner right here like that I said David
[1:28:18] Noble he's like Richard and so we just
[1:28:20] can't give each other hug was just

[1:28:32] something it taught me to love
[1:28:36] harder you know I remember playing
[1:28:38] football one time and we had a a young
[1:28:41] man there and he was a big boy he
[1:28:43] couldn't move fast he was just a big boy
[1:28:46] but you know the Lord was starting to

[1:28:49] know back then I was you know wide
[1:28:51] receiver f ass you know you know the two
[1:28:54] step burn somebody and go but you know a

[1:29:03] we pulled the huddle together I said
[1:29:04] look I want all y'all to go this way and

[1:29:21] bouncing off him left or right I said
[1:29:23] man we we got a power here we need to
[1:29:25] utilize that but you see the good things
[1:29:27] that come out of what sometimes we
[1:29:30] perceive like well he's built for that
[1:29:32] or he's fit for that and God used
[1:29:34] something totally different you know we
[1:29:37] just got to have that heart we got to
[1:29:39] had a heart like Ryan B Ryan uh how you
[1:29:42] say your last name Bonnie man I told

[1:30:12] different I'm you know like I said
[1:30:14] sometimes your life the way your raise
[1:30:16] forms and shapes you but that's not an
[1:30:18] excuse right it's not an excuse like you
[1:30:22] know people come to church the way they
[1:30:24] you come to church the way you are but
[1:30:25] you ain't going to stay that way right
[1:30:27] if you're growing you're going to see
[1:30:29] growth you know and and that that's
[1:30:31] something we've been seeing with brother

[1:31:50] be he'll work it out
[1:31:53] so you know uh now that I'm thinking

[1:32:01] face and he's like I think I found my
[1:32:03] calling I said Amen brother we're going
[1:32:05] to support you as long as we need to and
[1:32:07] as long as it's on your heart that's
[1:32:09] another thing don't do something you
[1:32:11] know if it if you don't have the fire
[1:32:13] for

[1:32:21] cold so I got tired of put my car hearts
[1:32:23] on and the you know the you know what
[1:32:25] I'm talking about so one day I woke up
[1:32:27] but my wife's funny because for about 6
[1:32:30] years I had complain I come home

[1:32:41] smart they in the books and yeah I can't
[1:32:45] achieve that and there she go pussing
[1:32:47] pussing pussing and about 6 years later
[1:32:50] I woke up one day I said H I think I'm
[1:32:51] about to let go be an
[1:32:53] inspector so I started studying yeah I
[1:32:56] started studying and then uh uh for
[1:32:58] about nine months I was studying and
[1:33:00] each test was $200 and there was
[1:33:02] two-part test uh residential commercial
[1:33:05] and um I went and took the test and and
[1:33:07] I remember uh walking into the test and
[1:33:11] uh the first one I I flunked three hours
[1:33:13] later I flunked it so I started getting
[1:33:16] a little weird you know man Hy I told
[1:33:18] you and go back and take it again so I
[1:33:21] went back took it again I passed it and
[1:33:24] then the commercial one came up I went
[1:33:26] and took that one I flung that one three
[1:33:28] times so about $1,200 later became an
[1:33:33] inspector but
[1:33:36] so but it it's a beautiful it's a
[1:33:38] beautiful job I do love it it's it's a
[1:33:40] you know I get to work with the craft
[1:33:41] still to trade and I get to talk to
[1:33:44] people I love talking to people meeting
[1:33:45] people I'm always waiting for an open
[1:33:47] door you know somebody's always
[1:33:49] struggling you know recently I had a a a
[1:33:51] young man at in Toledo Ohio Toledo is a
[1:33:53] very very rough neighborhood and um I
[1:33:56] was out there in Toledo and this man was
[1:33:58] in a wheelchair and uh I was talking to
[1:34:01] him and he was like we were talking and
[1:34:04] uh I was like can I ask you a question
[1:34:07] can I ask you why you in that wheelchair
[1:34:09] he said yeah man I just got shot three
[1:34:11] months ago three months ago yeah I was
[1:34:13] working on the house some guy came up to
[1:34:15] me to rob me I went like this to pull up
[1:34:19] he thought I was pulling a pistol out so
[1:34:20] he shot me young kid and uh it separate
[1:34:23] his spine and he became paraplegic
[1:34:26] paraplegic and I said well can I leave
[1:34:28] you with something I says he I said when
[1:34:31] you going to court he said I think I was
[1:34:34] like it was supposed to be like a month
[1:34:35] or
[1:34:36] something I said can I leave you with
[1:34:38] this I says whatever you do find it in
[1:34:42] your heart to forgive that
[1:34:45] man I says because if you hold on to a
[1:34:48] grudge and you hold on to the bitterness
[1:34:50] that this man shot you
[1:34:52] you gave him the
[1:34:53] win but if you can forgive this man and
[1:34:57] you move forward not only that you're
[1:35:00] free from that but now you didn't impede
[1:35:02] your walk with God and so he's looking
[1:35:05] at me listening like I like I had his
[1:35:08] attention you know and I said another
[1:35:10] thing too wear gloves go out get you
[1:35:12] some gloves because I got a buddy that
[1:35:15] his hands are gone and his rotator cuffs
[1:35:18] are gone and he's about giving up on
[1:35:20] life he's older now he's
[1:35:22] 60 maybe 65 67 or something oh 60 about
[1:35:27] 60 yeah it's my dad's best friend but so
[1:35:30] you know it's a situation where I gave
[1:35:31] him some advice on those things and and
[1:35:34] it's nice that when you can wait for
[1:35:36] opportunities and wait for times you
[1:35:37] know we should always be instant in
[1:35:39] season and out of
[1:35:42] season but you got to be prayed up you
[1:35:44] got to be your spirit's got to be right
[1:35:46] cuz people know people know you know and
[1:35:48] when you're talking to somebody you know
[1:35:50] you can sense when when uh my brother's
[1:35:53] won
[1:35:55] so pretty soon you going to get out of
[1:35:57] time Elisha you going to get out of time
[1:35:59] but when my brother's stressed out about
[1:36:01] time and I get next to him man it's like
[1:36:03] the magnets that push away from each
[1:36:05] other cuz I used to the reason why I
[1:36:07] know I know that is cuz when I was in
[1:36:09] business I was that way there's not
[1:36:10] enough time in a day you're trying to
[1:36:13] always you know you call the customer
[1:36:15] order materials you're thinking about
[1:36:17] the job tomorrow your wife's at the
[1:36:19] table and you're just your mind's gone
[1:36:20] you know what I I mean so you're
[1:36:22] stressed up because you care good
[1:36:24] business owners they don't have much
[1:36:27] time right good Christians they don't
[1:36:29] have much time to
[1:36:31] waste you understand what I'm saying so
[1:36:34] it's a situation to where yeah so I said
[1:36:36] we I give them a hug though you all
[1:36:38] right man yeah and then you start to
[1:36:40] feel that thing die out a little bit
[1:36:41] then the magnet turns around and it
[1:36:43] comes back together all right we in one
[1:36:45] Spirit
[1:36:46] again but anyway so I think I'll close
[1:36:49] on that brother Wade so what do I do
[1:36:52] next oh musicians all right musicians
[1:36:56] come on
[1:36:59] up
[1:37:00] [Applause]
[1:37:09] amen oh you may stand I'm sorry you may
[1:37:13] stand I'm G move
[1:37:19] out I know
[1:37:24] I'm going here excuse
[1:37:28] me that's life that's
[1:37:32] life and as a Christian you see
[1:37:35] them even from the couple years we've
[1:37:37] known them
[1:37:38] and you see that there's number one is
[1:37:42] it's it's
[1:37:43] honesty that way all the
[1:37:46] time not hiding nothing we ain't better
[1:37:49] than nobody else we come right through
[1:37:51] the same situations that everybody else
[1:37:53] come through maybe a little different
[1:37:54] way but we all come from
[1:37:57] somewhere but once you become a
[1:37:59] Christian you know where you're going
[1:38:01] yes that world don't know where they
[1:38:03] going Franklin you know that see see
[1:38:05] brother Franklin he was in the Army
[1:38:08] right wh which war was that you Iraq
[1:38:10] Iraq he was in Iraq saw a lot of his
[1:38:12] friends get get get blown up he'd go
[1:38:15] this direction they go that direction
[1:38:18] they' all get killed or or man
[1:38:21] you go this way wasn't your fault
[1:38:23] brother that was
[1:38:25] God turning that hummer this way to get
[1:38:29] you here
[1:38:31] today do you believe that it wasn't your
[1:38:34] fault these people got blew up got blown
[1:38:36] up no that's just man that's man's stuff
[1:38:38] but God turned you in that direction to
[1:38:40] get you here cuz he knew when you got
[1:38:42] here you'd want it more than anything in
[1:38:44] the world to me predestination is so
[1:38:48] simple God knew you'd want it he had it
[1:38:51] here for
[1:38:52] you and you took it you accepted it and
[1:38:56] if we take all the other Frills out
[1:38:57] that's true
[1:38:59] Christianity to know that God got you to
[1:39:01] a place to where he could talk to you
[1:39:03] amen many many people he may have talked
[1:39:05] to them along the way they didn't
[1:39:07] listen but Frank you listen you just
[1:39:10] keep going buddy you just keep you just
