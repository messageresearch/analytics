don't you because that's my desire my point and good to be in the house of the Lord remember the announcements um brother Aaron will be preaching this coming uh Wednesday Saturday will be the

study April the 5th brother Claude will be with us on April the 6th your Easter Gathering will be April the 12th the fellowship meeting will be May the 17th here brother Ernie Villanueva will be with us the Lord will it so remember these Brother Anderson said that they was going to be leaving a little early today go to take Mom back to the airport we enjoyed her being here with us and this great the Lord with will be with her as she travels and then she'll be back Lord willing uh in April who enjoyed having you there here with us amen in Matthew 13 and in Luke 1. let's just pray are we that all of meetings we got tried to give them an order where we'd remember them Heavenly Father we thank you for this day in your grace and love we know and realize without you there wouldn't be nothing here anyway you created all things and everything is for your being and your point that you desire for us to be is what we want to be and we ask you to just help us guide us now forgive our sins cleanse us and guide us and as we speak about you Lord you come on the scene and you manifest yourself through what we're trying to speak about and just have your way we love you Lord thank you for everything and just bless all the sick among us we know that you are the Healer and Lord we need you to come and speak to us about the sicknesses and the things and to heal each one Lord you promised it so we believe it you said that you sent your word and healed us father we know you sent your word so now the healing has got to be there in The Virtue to follow have your way with us now as we read your word you come and speak to us in Jesus name amen so we'll go to Matthew 13 36. remember you go back over um in the beginning of Matthew and it'll be the uh the second mystery that this is the mystery explain so it's reason we're going that way then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the towers of the field he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tires are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the Angels and therefore the tires are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world the son of man shall send forth his angels and they Shall Gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and then which do iniquity now notice the angels from the son of man were what gather out of this Kingdom you're gonna they're gonna drive him out of it uh you know and shall cast him into a furnace of fire there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the son in the Kingdom of their father who hath an ear to hear Let Him hear now let's go over to Luke and just read the one we were reading this morning the one verse 24 Luke 21 24. and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be a letter away captivity into all nations and we know that happened back Yonder you know woe unto them that are with child and give Shook and all that was back to her and Titus coming forth in A.D 70 and surrounding Jerusalem and then what in Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles unto all the time of the Gentiles be finished you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now not to back up a lot but for those who maybe won't hear uh this morning to make sure that they know kind of what we're talking about and to get our minds into the right Channel because that's what we want uh we were talking about this morning and we'll keep the same title this afternoon we'll stay with the title of dispensations and uh we read here in Luke that it says in the time of the Gentiles the prophet used it and said in the dispensation of the Gentiles so then that was my point was trying to get us to this morning to look at it that dispensation deals with a time wise that we're looking at are you know what's taking place in in the day and uh dispensation more or less refers to lack of stewardships or something like that is the natural word or even pulling from the Greek and it doesn't give I believe the true meaning of what we need to see but I you know I'm not trying to change anything I'm trying to speak of what is there in the word that it is the time of the Gentiles the dispensation or the times and I'm trying to get our point to looking at times and not looking at something that what wouldn't not fit together with all of the word of God and uh that way see it's all got to fit because the Bible can't as I said this morning you can't see if you say well brother random said we had a dispensation in the Old Testament dispensation in the new dispensation of the law dispensation of Grace and that's true we believe that but remember he goes on to say then I'm not much on a dispensationalist actually he said he was well if you ask me today you'd say brother Dale or you're a dispensations I said yeah according to my understanding of dispensations but maybe according to a lot of people's understanding of that I would not be one because I believe it's the same God in the Old Testament is revealed in the New Testament all right see it's not two different gods it's the same God all right you'd say well now if the Old Testament reveals one dispensation you say well that's a dispensation of a father and you know that being one God and then the New Testament being a dispensation of the son and it being a different God then I'm not a dispensationalist either you know I believe that's the former idea of the point that he was saying when he said I'm not on that but he went on to say the quotes I gave you the three he said the Gentile dispensation right in the same quote Parts you know so my point is uh I believe in one true and living God revealed throughout the entire word of God all right now I believe that the revealing of God was not complete now take my wording and listen are finished even in Jesus Christ and even though he was the fullness of the god hid bodily all right and he was the son of man but that was not the completion of it all right because there is a bride to be revealed and the prophet said she's part of the mystery and must be revealed all right now I believe that's Christ in history I'll get back to those points later but see I believe that it's the same God being revealed all the way through and I believe like in the ages then that it's uh not him revealing himself in one age is something and the other age is something else the ages is the revealing of God to us of the part that was not made known back there in human flesh as he was walking the Earth he was the fullness of the godhead bodily yeah but we had to be in him all right so we're not something added that would be a dispensation like mankind is looking at at something here and something here different no we are not anything different we are him made manifest in a mini-membered body whereas it was once in one body see now we are the body of God upon the Earth and he's revealing himself in the way that is to be done all right we'll cover in a little bit that down through the church ages he was revealing himself as Son of God all right then in the end time he'd be revealing himself a son of man right now I want you to watch this real careful in a minute I'll say it and then repeat it because I want you to follow the line and I remember in my early years of studying it and we had an old battery-powered type player for the seven inch real recorder you know thing that we we carried to work and back and we'd listen to run around preaching as we'd go to work you know and coming back and we would it was a battery powered and we didn't always have hookups in the car you know so in the old days so we'd have to run batteries and I have sit there because it'd have enough battery to keep the voice I've sat there with a pencil and actually turned the thing halfway home because I was interested in hearing you know I'd turn it myself make it go and the rest of it you know because I wanted to hear and I remember we we hit something I've mentioned this before to you but we were probably and we'd always just choose you know like I choose one day brother moat would one day brother Holland one brother Lewis and for some reason one week whenever any of us chose but one type we had the unveiling of God and uh so we played that for five days you know it just went that way we just didn't bring another one well you know about the fourth day I really caught what he was saying and uh you know it really dawned on me the point that he was making and it cleared up the Scriptures it cleared up a lot of things to me as to my understanding of the one true and living God now we'll read this in a minute so then we'll go back through it but see he's revealed as three sons name right so the man Son of God Son of David all right but see if you don't see it in the correct order look what you'd be going and then when we would cover that son of man was Dire profit dying giving his life come forth Son of God in the ages then you'd be looking at the next thing to be would be son of David well you'd be totally out of the scriptures you know even though you're quoting identically because there's only three sons names the Son of God or son of man Son of God Son of David all right but you've got a little key in there that you got to understand and we'll read it in a minute but see then it just clicked when he said it one day it's either any son of man prophet God himself in human flesh come to die not son of man wrote Son of God come forward to church ages Son of God in the end time he comes back a son of man and then you'll go to that to Israel as son of David and see then the scriptures beautifully fit the things that he was trying to explain begin to unfold is it dead then that's where I preached that the bride would be there in 1969 that the bride would be the son of man in the last days all right and uh because you think about it look how you would mess up your scriptures son of man is Prophet is we'll review these in a minute because I want you to let him say it I'm saying it and getting your thought in your mind that he was son of man and he died it was prophet son of man because you couldn't kill Son of God there was no way see that that the Son of God at Calvary had to exit out of the body or the spirit of God the very life of God had to exit out of the body all right then on the Pentecost the Holy Ghost could come back the and be Son of God Through the Ages but if you went right straight on the son of David how are you going to get there you can't go and I thought how many of us has missed that and knowing this all these years and tried my best to appreciate unto you you know it surely gets more interesting every day you can't go from Son of God the son of David you've got to come back to a human element wise you know you've got to come back to that son of man so I'm saying this if you miss the message you know at least what I'm trying to say it's got to be then that Luke 17 30 would come into line and and it would be falling into place and see then once he comes in fully into bride and son of man you can go right onto Israel but you know what he'll start off to Israel Son of God New Birth all right what you want to call it for them not in the Kingdom but eternal life you don't have to die again to give it to him but he'll give them the Holy Ghost then they'll see through those two Prophets The Son of Man and then they will see and realize that he is now son of David to them all right we'll read a quote here in just a minute where brother Ryan said he's the son of David to us now I love him little things it's laid in there and then it makes me Ponder consider what is being said you know because you see he's revealed to you and I as son of man Son of God and Son of David he reveals himself to his bride while she's here living all the manifestations that he'll ever be to anyone he's made known to her so he's the son of David in my Revelation but yet he's the son of man yet he's the son of God because it's the same God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ all right so if you missed the message now you'll know that's what I'm talking about so we'll let him let him do the reading all right now watch as we go through it and watch this the point that we were talking about dispensations because then he's going to be the dispensation of the son of man and we'll let the prophet read it to you that where he says he couldn't be the son of God now that don't mean he's not Son of God he was born son of God right right and there's a quote in there with a prophet you know because he just time after time he says that he never revealed himself his son of God he said he never called himself Son of God he never referred to himself as Son of God that he referred to himself the son of man all right but see he was born the son of God because that's God in human flesh and he growed in Grace and knowledge because he was born to Emmanuel but then he never mentioned son of man until he enters his ministry then he begins to talk about son of man and isn't it odd how that I've always said to you that none of the scholars called it schofield's got some good points about it even Paul Peter didn't write about son of man but then when brother starts out in his ministry just immediately when he enters his ministry as to preaching start talking about the son of man that's no coincidence to me that's exactly what it's supposed to be all right now we've quoted this many times to you the prophet of God said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for he said Satan will be powerless before you think Satan could handle or could now let me quote it and get it straight what brought around said none of us is a match for the devil no no no Luther wasn't a match for the devil no way but yet when God revealed that just shall live by faith Satan with no match for that message that came forth in Martin Luther they said Martin Luther don't you know the world is against you he said I want them to know that I'm against them see nothing could tackle that message they could pick on the man and look what they're doing now nobody can tackle this message or the hour that has been given unto us but look what even inward ranks are coming forth and now they would not have dire said a word while he was alive but now they're running forth with their own messages well you know what I believe they're doing they're running without a message because they run out of this message into their own all right but think about it now and just watch the point and remember when we read it that he never referred to himself as son of man because that was not his office at the time that was not his dispensational of revealing himself the in any even goes to Peter you know who the man say I the son of man am Peter said darn the Christ the son of the Living God he never said Peter now hold it hold on hold it I'm not the Son of God now let me tell you I'm gonna straighten you out you know no because he knew that's all they can handle so he said Peter you didn't answer my question because you don't understand son of man I said you've got the right point that I'm the son of God and upon that Revelation I'll be over my church on the revelation of Son of God I said in the end time I'm going to come back in the day when the son of man is to be revealed you know all right think on these things see then that way I'm not a dispensationalist to believe in changing of gods or changing of that I believe every Church aged there was God made manifest for the age they were in all right but I believe he puts it all in the end and not giving us anything any different because I believe what Luther talked I believe what Wesley taught I believe the truth of what they talk I believe what the Baptist taught the Presbyterian talk the Pentecostals talk I believe the truth of it God is part of God's word see that way I'm not rejecting anything I'm not an isolationist or what you'd call it you just don't want your brain about no anything I guess we're lulaites we just that's what I believe that we're trying to be what God wants us to be for the hour we're in okay now watch as he begins to as it begins to unfold and and you'll see the pattern coming down in the dispensations will fall into place are the times or the revealing will fall into place to where we can see it so go ahead brother Joe I guess I mean who's my car Dave Bob and Joe I guess the other day I was looking around I said they must have this thing on automatic all right look what he says I wish you would listen to the unveiling of God the Mighty God unveiled especially those two messages and study them and then like I said you'll see there's words in there that'll if you'll really study what he's saying and then when you do you'll see something and it'll just open up the beautiful picture of the Plan of Redemption from God all right now watch he came in three names three sons name he came into son name of the son of man the son of David and the Son of God now he didn't put them in order but yet we know the order because he puts you know the message did he put them in order then he explains it now now he came first in the son of he started to say David and or whatever because they put the point there he said Son of Man so he came first the son of man because he was a prophet now Jehovah himself called Ezekiel and the prophets son of man what's this thou you know son of man Jesus never referred to himself as Son of God he referred to himself as son of man because the scriptures cannot be broken right now look how specific the prophet with no education could talk it baffles me because maybe you don't follow it the way I do you know maybe that's good that you don't but look he never referred to himself as Son of God he never referred to himself as Son of God he didn't say they didn't write that he was the son of God look at Perfect maybe you don't follow scripture like that I mean those things mean great to me the Bible could call him the Son of God when he was born the Bible can put him into lineage and call him a son of God right well he says he Jesus never referred to himself as Son of God how perfect is it being it is he referred to himself as son of man because the scriptures cannot be broken I like going to the next that was paragraph 60. this is progress 68 same message the unveiling of God notice he came first as the prophet and they crucified him his own crucified him he came as the son of man then after the Holy Spirit came he was then the son of God is the spirit he was the Holy Spirit Son of God he lived through the church ages as Son of God watch him now in the Millennium it'd be son of David sitting on the throne of his father David he is the son of David now he is to you and I and he is the son of David he just wasn't making himself manifest to him he was the son of David but you know he didn't change God's he was the same God as what I tried with all this about dispensation that gets you to look at it very Stewart Son of God Son of Man son of David standing on Earth but he was not making himself known in that way he was making himself known as son of man because you can't kill God which would be the Son of God and he certainly can't kill the son of David me so he had to come as a human man to release that life that was within him that's why it's called son of man see watch it but look at the point he says what caught me they were listening see he's the son of David sitting upon the throne of his father and remember between the son of God and he just kind of stops in the lady you'll see an age they put him out who and be real careful with me they rejected this message and let you see her and they put brother random out because he started out preaching the 400 000 wasn't preaching the 30. you know 30 people or something or less and see they turned him out and just like it was to Samuel when God said they haven't rejected you Samuel they've rejected me they wanted Samuel in their organizational systems of this world wanted the great prophet of this day to come and have healing campaigns one thing was to draw money for their own benefit but yet it was to benefit the people of healings and great things but when he began to preach right what did he say when you begin to say I'm my father one all right so then look at what it's doing now I want to I want to be slow if I have to real slow I want you to get this I've got notes written now that would take if I appreciate four more sermons and I've never been that far ahead I hadn't I've never been that far ahead in 40 something years of preaching remember the son of David and the ladies in church a son of God's gift they put him out he said we'll put it down they didn't put out the Holy Spirit not like not wanting it they wanted to be there to the great signs and wonders but they don't want the word that is related to this Holy Spirit so you see what they're putting out you return down the word you automatically turn down the spirit and you can holler and scream all you want to I got the Holy Ghost right and you dress and act and do like the world now don't tell me too late huh it's even that way you can say I love the word it's only up to a certain degree right so father what we're going through and then Luke watch look at the point they put him out they put the Holy Spirit out of the church you remember Wade Wednesday night and what he was bringing from what brother Brown said that the Holy Ghost has been bound for 2000 years at the door of Creeds and dogmas but to be loosed in the end time by thank you the last Angel's message right so the Holy Ghost even in the Great Book of Acts you look right over it and there it was right in the church beginning to Fall Away see then the Holy Ghost never really been loosed for 2000 years that's me back before count that's back before it came right you get the point the Holy Ghost is never worked the way he wanted to work but is to do that in the end time but look the latest teenage they put him out now Son of God so looked like he should have been saying and next he revealed himself as son of David that's supposed to be the next in line isn't it so the man Son of God Son of David one two three well look son of man Son of God son of man so David and just in case some of you out there are so smart that you think four is an antichrist number I happen to know that is white black red and pale but I happen to know that four is a restoration number right justification sanctification baptismal ghost and then the word right so then we think we're so well I just cut him off he don't even understand four you got to pulpit all I want is to ask you a question how can you go from Son of God to son of David to go to son of David you've got to come back to earth and something right so watch him and in Luke now he's put out of the lady of cnh Son of God and in Luke he said he'll be revealed as son of this as son of man the prophet come on fulfilling the rest of it see the scriptures ties perfectly together son of man Son of God Son of David the mystery is hidden right there in a few words it needs to come back from Son of God to the ages and the end time is to come as the son of man a great mystery but yet everybody knows all about the prophet came amen thank God but remember the prophet is just like Luther Luther preached the message of the just shall live by faith but the Catholic Church never got scared of him it was when the people began to believe the message Satan's wouldn't have scared of brother random he couldn't tackle him he knew better to try it but yet when he passed off look what he'd done they've attacked this message from every form of could be thought of it but look the scriptures tie perfectly together son of man Son of God Son of David what was it it's the same God all the time just changing his form in morphe right he's just changing here it's a great drama to him he is acting it out displaying himself as son of man the prophet God to come and die right can't kill Son of God can't kill son of David right son of man right had to come but then he comes down to the ages of Son of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost but in the end time he's being revealed as son of man then he can go to Israel the son of David to me that's marvelous I saw it then and I rejoiced and you know I've cried and done everything in the book try to get people to see that well I just don't know don't get confused don't worry honey you already are he was born and I was born confused it's going to take the Holy Ghost to straighten this out and just because that he went from because now I'm going to show you something that's going to you're going to think I'm against brother random we're going to give you a quote after while I or this maybe not this evening where he said he died son of man and Rose Son of God I I thought the son of man raised I taught the son of man flesh was one that appeared to Mary I didn't know it was just some theophany form of Son of God it's the way he's explaining how it's going to change dispensations it's going to change the way he's revealing himself because as I said when he said who the man said I was on a map they didn't get it we said all right I gotta bring the church ages but what's going to be amazing is when we get about two more sermons over and we'll come back into what we've preached all 40 something years he stands in the midst of the seven gold and candlesticks one like unto the son of man because she's going to give birth to him whether we believe it or not whether we want to be a part of it or not that's our choice all right what is it same God all the time just changing his form well who is the life form of God in the Gentile dispensation of course the way most people believe it it was right around them brother random was a part of the body of Christ because he was a born-again Christian that's right but he was not to complete a morphe of God or the form of God we've been through all that we've preached it over over but follow it now remember between the son of God and remember between the son of God where would his thought be going when he would be going between the Son of God and what Son of God and Son of David he's going to come back as son of man does everybody what do you believe what I'm saying or not do you understand I can't reveal that and I can't make you see it right but do you understand what I'm saying well we don't believe you we believe brother Brandon well I just read what he said no you argue with him well what about it look how he keeps referring and like I said isn't it odd because these all these quotes and things I deliberately brought in things about the the end time prophet of Malachi 4. is to keep our thoughts in the line the son of man would not be in The Bride of Jesus Christ in the end time unless God fulfilled his word to bring Malachi 4 into being in Luke 17 30 and Revelations 10 7. let's go or I don't need no Prophet I'll just be what I'm supposed to be I'm going to be God made manifest now you're the devil that's as plain as I can put it because you got it in the wrong line if it ain't lined up straight we're not going to come out to the right thing and even if it's lined up perfect until it's revealed he does us no good that's right well it's been revealed to me because I read it that don't make a revelation you read the Bible before you heard the prophet why wasn't it it was revealed to you well because God has to reveal it okay let's go on now and get to thought look at the next one number seven God's provided place of worship 65 425 paragraph 192. tell them about to come into the Lord Jesus for the Holy Ghost and the living presence of the Living God Jesus said in Saint Mark here he said in that day the son of man will be revealed that's in Luke and brings it out in Mark also now remember not Son of God he came in three sons names son of man Son of God Son of David when he was on Earth he come as the son of man he was a prophet now Sid is it coincidental that there had to be a prophet you know a man on Earth to bring the message in the end time if that don't give the honor and glory to the position that brother Branham held in I don't understand you and your thinking go that puts the whole dependence upon whether or not God sent the man there's been a lot of good men and good thoughts and good preaching and things but see we're putting all I or I am at least I have everything I've got I don't have no extra basket you know in financial matters you don't put all of your eggs in the same basket well I don't have many eggs so it don't matter how many baskets I could put them in four baskets and wouldn't have to worry about too many in the baskets all right but in religious matters that's what I tried to say this morning if you're talking about a dispensation that reveals a different God from one time to the other then that's then that's the doctrine of dense sensationalist theology that goes into the unified part of mankind trying to bring it out but to see the same God revealed in many forms for yet the same God that's wonderful to me I mean but look he came in three sons and I saw the man Son of God Son of David when he was on Earth he comes son of man he was a prophet so the man is a prophet Jehovah himself called the prophets Jeremiah and them son of man what's his style Jesus come because he had to come according to the scriptures he had to come ask the son of man Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like an unto me now he was referring to his own self wouldn't he because he referred to the prophetic side and he had to be a prophet son of man but after his death burial and Resurrection now he has been Son of God the supernatural the Holy Spirit so that's what come back on the death Pentecost because that son of man died to release that Holy Ghost and after his Ascension and the things that happened to that human element of his and I believe he raised in an eternal body so then you you're losing your son of man contact point I was just trying to bring out an illustration a moment ago that the prophet is right when he died son of man then he rose Son of God on the dead Pentecost the Holy Ghost came to prove it so it's going to be Son of God down through seven Church ages right all right and look what he goes on to say it's the great Holy Spirit this is the unveiling of God paragraph 65. now notice now as he came he had to come as son of man because the holy spirit said that he would God would raise up a prophet to them so he could not come calling himself the Son of God because it wasn't that dispensation you got it I need to walk back down we got him we got it we got it okay he could not come calling himself the Son of God because it wasn't that dispensation all right he was the son of man prophesying to fulfill and reveal to them all the things that had been done and taught what he was then he was on the earth as son of man and I say Luke 17 30 says he'll return us son of man it's no coincidence that God would send a prophet in this age in time right promised in the word now these are familiar statements but let's just get at least one out of it go ahead with number nine and think about what he's saying now we're in a changing dispensation and ever change just like building a building you come to the corner you have to make that bend it's strange everybody wants to run a straight line on down you'd have just one big wall but we're building a building and we've come to the corners and you've got to change those Corners that's Brother Don price so well he and so well stated it not long ago at those changes is where the Trouble Comes where the it's hard on that corner to make cut that corner and make it just right simple illustration we built a house in 1965. we had the you call them batter box boards or what is it called batter boards that you put out and you square everything up and you you get it you run your strings you know and you you get that right and you start out and and it don't matter what this building you can take that corner to that corner and it's the same thing as that corner to that corner is square right it's Square if you ever want to do anything and you want to get his choir just measure from you know this is not Square so we'll cut it down a little these measure this corner make sure it's same back on you guys squared you can fool around all you want to you grind parade doing what you want to trying to Market just do that and it'll simply be square we had to do things a little different in our day the easiest way to level a house a room they got it new today because they got a water hose a water glass is the most simple thing if you wanted to see if this Pulpit was level set a water glass fill it to the brim if it's off right it won't be right so what's he saying he said we're in a change in a dispensation all right he said everybody wants to down the wall That's Pentecost and different ones because it's easy if you can get one string to the other one to just keep things going we underpin the house one time and old house we lived in and already had some kind of pillars in it and we were doing them well I came in one day and my little wife she had laid about uh 10 not 6 by 10 sex in the blocks and it was good the only problem she had she laid according to the Contour of the land because she didn't know you go over step down step down she she just let him go into well she done it and she just took pieces of concrete and just put it in the top it was perfect we were going to stucco it anyway so what did it matter all right what you see anybody can lay a straight line if you got a strain to go with it's easy you just get some rain but when you come to a corner as I saying about that house we booked the the batter boxes or what you call them put them up well one day this cow decided she wanted to go through where the building was going to be so she tore down the corner well I asked the man I said what in the world am I going to do he said we'll try to square it like we do corner to corner and do the best you can so we drove back to Stakes we put them up well it looked pretty good and they laid the blocks according to the strain I put back but when we got ready to put down the floor joists we come to find it out that it wasn't exactly Square you know how you do it with floor joists if you want to make sure they're Square just take your four by eight she do plywood and nail it down on one corner it's going to square it so when they got over that corner to come find out it was sticking over about two inches then we had to do a little scabbing on you know but my point is I wouldn't a carpenter but a real man that can make today that take that corner a real Carpenter can start right here on this corner and you can wear yourself to death he can go to another corner and start if he really knows what he's doing brother random knew what he was doing that's what he said he come to change the corner right God sent us a prophet to change the corner but what did he say we're doing we're not building a bill uh blind a wall he said we're building a building what it had to be that last Corner turned to make this building come out right and let's say that a real Carpenter he doesn't have to have all of the modern things of line strong for the Gary he can tell you you get three corners you can get the other Corner if you know what you're doing might be all for half an inch quarter inch on a big house which not much we got a problem for that I'm going to solve her we was doing something up at terrence's one day he looked at it and he said daddy that ain't Right Said that corner is off so there's a gap there I said we're just going to fill that up we're caulking he said but Daddy they don't make three-quarter inch caulking all right check everybody a little bit but we're changing he said changing dispensation another known down below there we're talking about changing dispensation see when he come into the when this Prophet came into being in the last days he knew that he wasn't just laying a straight line but you know what he had to do now he says me okay when Azusa Street came in see Luther Wesley Pentecost when Azusa Street came in they had the lines going straight supposed to be in the start with all right it was up to him to find that corner so what did Brother random do remember he had to back up to the Pentecostals and relay every bit of that have you heard him enough I want to say that you know his message didn't begin until 1963. but in the years of preparation he said and I will restore the years of the cankerworm five more Locust the caterpillar so he had to back up to that line of Zeus's Street and know that was exactly right and shoot that line and get that line straight and rebuild the wall but then he had to make a corner to make that finalize change or dispensation to turn that corner to hit it back to hit back with Luther it had to be a prophet so then God would be promised in Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 7. to send us a prophet to be able to take that word and turn that corner and square back up to be able to hit exactly on that other one today folks you draw a line at 100 100 feet draw to 50 feet and if you don't get it exactly squared you can be an inch off in a hurry you remember the prophet you shoot the gun what about it you shoot a gun he said you're off a higher here right you just twitch the barrel you let somebody touch the barrel move it or something Danny's shaking his head these shooters know what I'm talking about 100 yards you're way off right see he couldn't afford that God knew what he's doing so he went back and let that man relay all of that building he laid Luther in Foundation he laid Wesley he laid the Pentecost brought it all back to Restoration and then he made the corner now but when he made the corner I thought now I'm just honest and just always believed this I believe what the Bible says that the apostles prophets pastors evangelists teachers is for the perfecting of the Saints and once brother Branham got to Corner laid and turned with his message now you and I can go straight down that line as long as we stay with this message but remember we're trying to hit where Luther left off we're lining up the right way they say Tony and I believe he's the best tall layer in the country but if he don't like what it looks like and it ain't exactly right and you'll take it up and do it again that's a good tile layer you say well it's just a sixteenth of an inch I'm laying some at Richards the other day and I told him I said he said that sure is funny looking over one corner I said yeah but it had been a whole lot more fun here if I hadn't leaned it see instead of putting it down Squire and being over the wall and all that being perfect I turned it made this wall straight and that wall come off about that far and if that and this wall over here would look like that on one end and that way on the other end you ever hung vinyl you don't hang vinyl from the bottom you measure from the top down right and if you've got to put anything out of line put it out of line on the bottom and then lay it all and you come up to the top and you got 14 feet or 20 feet or 100 feet you want it to look right because you sure don't want it to look like that on one end and that on the other one it shows up you don't know what you're doing so when you get out of level down who's going to look at the bottom and say oh that ain't level no let me see real random put it right this message is right amen he laid that corner perfectly his message is laid that corner he said we're not building a wall we're building a building well I thought the building that we were supposed to be building is the body of Jesus Christ into the statue of a perfect man and I believe the five full ministry you see them now my Lord they come one time when God did and he said I want you to come to help me well you won't know and I know you can lay blocked I've seen you said we're building chicken houses 300 foot long if you can do it I said yeah but I said you went on to work my way he said what I said if it don't look right I'll tear it down start again I'm Tony with that he wouldn't like it for three days later I'm still tearing the wall down putting it back because I wanted to be right see this message is Right folks the prophet came and turned that corner he gave us all the dimensions all of the things and told us look at Dental Wade's house remodeling it and we had a guy with a transit to shoot it you know perfectly in line perfectly level we laid afford to Foundation Alex saw that out we started laying two or three blind I said this thing ain't right I said well he shot it with a Transit I know I helped him I drove the stage and I marked the mark and put the state right he said what do you mean I said it's out about two inches and we can't afford that go to the house it's gonna be sitting off the corner you see that's how people are sometimes made for jobs of doing things whether Gary does a marvelous job of building that's right it's good to build behind him you know it's good to work on something he's worked on because you can depend on it being squire things will be right well see that's what we are in the five-fold ministry the five-fold ministry is to Build That Wall after the prophet turned the corner now what do we build it with he gave us all the material he gave us everything I don't have to worry about laying blocks I just line up with a message man and look down through there you get into machinist work then you have your machinists in here with a Donnie I know he's worked kind of around that but you know there's people that can see five thousands of an inch in machinist work that's how good the eyeball is five thousands that's a good chewing gum paper they ain't even that thick hey we're that particular why wouldn't we be particular he doesn't know what Paul says be careful how you build upon the foundation is that scripture you get it lined up straight we've got the string strung from one corner to the other one we just keep laying it right on Down the Line four 40 years later we're still laying somebody's going to complete this building it's going to be finished because we're changing dispensation it is on a wall it's a building he builds a house and there's many cuts and turns that he's predicted here in the Bible why don't we believe it what are those turns and cuts let's deal with it just a little amen we're going to have another sermon out of this one look at number 11 number and we're kicked off ten we're gonna number 11 64 427 of Mercy is called a trial in Tucson Arizona to paragraph 235. now Jesus never said in the days when the Son of God will be revealed he was revealed in the church age I read it he was revealed in the church age Son of God but the church hath put him out that's what they put out they put out the son of God they didn't want it not when it began to be lined up when that Prophet began to get them corners and bringing it down they didn't like it too straight too straight to talk to women about cutting their hair painting the face wearing pants different things men long hair too straight I'll go somewhere where they don't preach on them things you'll build it I hope you got that point on me well look he was revealed in the church ages the son of God it's been the Holy Ghost in every Church age come on 464 silver justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost and another great prophet sent he refers to and I'll give you the quotes before Azusa Street is referred to as the prophet he said the Holy Ghost came himself on the day of Pentecost Noosa Street Pentecost then the word comes 2 36. then he would really reveal this son of man when the son of man is being revealed God manifested amongst the human beings like it was then son of man prophetic Malachi 4 is Promised a Seer to come forth with a voice come on Ron well how do you read that God manifests amongst the human beings well that was brother Branham when he come to preach he was amongst the human beings Glory that's good well now in a minute when we read it's in the people are you going to shout about that remember this morning raise your hand if you think he got the Holy Ghost raise your hand if you think he brought raise your hand if you believe the bride's going to be the fullness well I'll go so far wait a minute my hand not getting up very good but see that's what most people believe that's saying when the son of man is being revealed God among God manifested amongst the human beings like it was then son of man Prophet okay we go brother Brandon was the prophet he had the resurrection message he had the dead raising message physically and spiritually all right well now let's read on a little go to the next one number 12. which is the unveiling of God 1964. paragraph 73. far for his acts now remember he's in the acts of a play it's on the unveiling of God if I was taken he said and that he just acted the part of death because all of this is acting but remember you got to have characters if you're going to have acting right for for his acts to change he changes his form then he came the son of man now what divide that so don't read that he came the son of man and then thank the next go watch he came the son of man now it starts you sinning for the reformers age Wesley Luther and all down through then we find out they got it so bundle up just like the Israelites did then when he does appear in the last days in the Pentecostal age as the Holy Spirit they reject it they did the same thing Israel did and what does he do now he's going to be rejected in any returns as son of man and then from that Senator David see how close we are son of man son of David Son of God is revealed in the last days of Son of Man according to Malachi 4 all the rest of her prophecies pertaining to this hour no more dealing with the church after he they put him out on the outside knocking at the door some predestinated seed in there yet we he must get to them now we know brother random was put out we know that you know they finally got where they wouldn't even Marley nobody wanting him but really where is he at now the first sermon I preached in this Lula was not at this church it was the week before in my home and in the next week here was going Beyond man's camp because that was 71. and it already started camping down and I preached going Beyond man's camp and you know what they've done we're going Beyond man's Camp let us go out unto him you realize if he's out of church sister Gail we better get out of it you remember the Catholic priest on the message he said we've either got to get to church straight or get out of the church he's seen that much if God is outside the church where you want to be right right but I'm going in there to try to help him yeah they went to nice here to try to help them and they brought out a trinity Doctrine and finally developed what do you want and I'm not against going anywhere as a matter of fact I've told you I ain't saying I won't go nowhere else and preach I didn't say that but I'm through with trying to preach outside of this church but I'd rather go right over there and preach in that Baptist non-denominational church than to try to go to people in this message and preach you can say what you want to about me you want internet anybody we ain't paying you and you ain't paying us because they've already shut you out oh yeah I can call them up on the phone I'm going to be in your community next week you know I thought it might come by and preach for you that's what they tell me you know well how can you turn down a guy which tells you that fella came one time me and brother dick was outside the man came up he was supposed to come and sing he called me one to come and sing I said come right on I never mentioned preaching brother dick knows what happened man came up me and brother Dick and him were standing there talking he reached over in his car and he said I want to preach today I better get my stuff in you under get ready brother dick looked at me and said he gonna preach I said I reckon he is I mean but my phone don't never ring to go anywhere to preach well I'm not sad at that I'm glad my voice is wearing out my body's wearing out it's the best for me to just to stay home be the best I can I'm just if I quit I just sat down here do not worry about it but why me be concerned with trying to go help somebody you go preach in their Church amen Wade went one the other day man got it behind him you know and said now if there's any seed in it not work seed to just throw it out I got up and said tell me where the seed is you know but that's the way things will go where are we at we turn the son of man then son of David how close we are look where we're at go to the next one he's outside the church the Son of God trying to reveal himself as son of man and look as I said brother Brandon was welcomed in his early Ministry everybody wanted him oh he's got some strange Doctrine about serpent seed but we still want him because he draws a big crowd and we get the big old keep my money out of it you know and we get a lot of people come in our churches well isn't it odd that's the way it was with the Lord Jesus the young Prophet From Galilee was welcomed but when he began to say I'm my father won he wasn't too welcomed look what he said on the unveiling of God paragraph 8184. oh brother sister are you catching it congregation says amen look don't don't you see it it's been veiled through these ages okay according to what God Said and it will be opened in the last days those Seven Seals would be broke and the full thing would come into view of the people what's took place all along the hour of the seventh Angels message black all the mysteries of God should be made known in that Elijah this last hour how that Christ is put out of his church the son of God how he is revealed the son of man again how that the church is to be put in order and everything for the last days they no Creed no denomination you remember that quote from the message on the fullness of the godhead bodily put it around and said no leaven among her brings the fullness of the godhead no Creed no denominator absolutely the word living in the individual I'll take one and leave one now you ain't dealing with just a prophet right I'll take this and leave that one that's just there's no strings no denomination no bindings or nothing it's the it's the heart with God in him alone he said see look at the next one the rapture preacher 65 1204 paragraph 117. and now that's the age that we're living in right now the seventh Church age now it's all to be manifest in the grain of wheat at the end now are you with me did have the all of the message that I preached about the grain of wheat original to come back if you lost that if not not back about three months ago and start listening over and come up to where we're at you'll see what I'm talking about notice it's all to be manifested in the grain of wheat at the end another comeback now if you'll take Luke the 17th chapter and the 30th verse he's referring to the grain of wheat and it wasn't today so start of social being the coming of the son of man when the son of man begins to reveal himself what is revealed make his revelation of what he is in this day revealed reveal out to the people the word that's made known for the day revealed to the People by the manifestation of the Holy Spirit making that Jesus live among us all right that's a promise for this age let me get okay point of wheat bypass 15 go to 16. the unveiling of God paragraph 3 18 and the remember the grain must be germatized see come back to Perfection back to regular grain again all right the grain must be germatized see if it don't it won't live see none of that was outside of them messages will ever come to life look how straight a man could talk huh you'd have to be dramatized to it but remember the same life that was in the stalk is in the grain it's just maturing itself right back see there see he revealed himself what son of man the grain that went into the ground get the message congregation says amen oh boy ain't that something amen where are they now the Greek said to him we would see Jesus he said except the grain of corn fall into the ground see all right now the end right there by saying this go listen just sir as we would see Jesus and see if it's not referring that when they come to Jesus they come to see God you'll get the message when they come to see Jesus sirs we would see Jesus they wouldn't say and we want to see Jesus you know they knew that had to be part they wanted to see God come on get it listen to the table see what your Prophet said they wanted to see God I'll bring it in the next message nothing else when they got to her they wanted to see God but what did God say God said lest the corner wheat dies and go to the ground it'll abide alone if it goes forth he'll come forth a month before they wanted to see God the only way you'll ever see God is through the grain of wheat that goes into the ground the grain of wheat is the word the son of man is the only sower of the seed that there is that's why brother Branham listen could stand here in the end time to not give us a different Revelation but could tell us what no man could ever tell you the Lord Jesus preached six seals in Matthew 24. he didn't preach the seventh am I right and see a Prophet come taking us into not what Jesus didn't preach I don't believe that I don't believe brother Randall could bring anything to you and I that wouldn't end the word of God see Jesus knew he was the corn of wheat that was going into the ground and you remember the message the corner of wheat had to go into the ground in the dark ages to the church are you with me still in the message but promised to be restored to the full original grain again in the end time in The Bride of Jesus Christ I'm just trying to tell us who we are I wish to God at some way and I had a great education some words or something to be able to express it somebody has got to make the word manifest I didn't write the message I wasn't the prophet that said the bride is to vindicate Malachi for vindicate Luke 17 30 vindicate Revelations 10 7 and these other things well I didn't know he'd said that you got a computer running in if you ain't call me when I put it on the message a dozen times the man told me one time he said something I said you hang on a minute I gotta go far at my computer because my natural computer says right around said so and so that's my brain but you don't you won't believe my brain so if I can't find it if I can't find that quote for you and he just said what I said I'll send you an apology and you can send it to the world that I'm a false prophet I said because I know he said it I just don't have the memory to tell you the page number I reckon he figured if I was that straight about it then I knew what I was talking about but that's where people think well I don't know he said that that's why I read it you can't argue with me about what I read right come on musicians we'll make a number three out of this thing let's see church I'm just trying my best because you and I to realize what God has made us it is he that hath made us the scripture said and not we are saved the Bible says you can't even that was written before to come up with all his paintings to said you can't add no color to you however nowadays they add color to it you can't add one heart to it now you just go get your transplant and I'm not against that I'm just saying what the Bible says it used to be a movie I remember years ago you probably remember was called a million dollar man I got blowed up and they had a few parts left and they had you know parts of it and they put it back and they just made him a bionic body told him a Million Dollar Man Danny sitting back there he's almost a million because he got a million yeah he pretty close he goes by he goes by a guy or Cannery they take his gold hung up in there but now they've got almost total bodies made from material brought around and said they broke into God's Laboratory it's amazing what mankind can do but his member is because God give him the ability let's stand well number three anybody have a need go ahead they come from thank you something bothering her in this sinus problem let's just believe doctors have done all they can do and you know but we know who the real healer is right so let's believe father in the name of Jesus Christ the one we've talked about today we lay our hands upon our wife as a poor example but as to do what your word said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover Satan replace the blood of Jesus Christ between our wife and you about this hurting and our wife's jaw or her sinuses or whatever it is and her teeth or gums and we ask you Lord Jesus to just stand there in the way and forbid Satan in this that he's trying to break up on the body we believe you and we thank you and we thank you Lord for your love in Jesus name amen think about it be free for me what happened the holy place I can't sing so you help me go ahead the way what is it is a wonderful hour that we're living in just recognize Who We Are fun you raise your hand in the same we believe with the bride of Christ I'm just trying to get you to look at what the Bible and the prophet said about this ride the Bible gives a beautiful picture like Wade was saying Wednesday night you get over Revelation 21. John deceives the city describes the pride season Brian describes the city you can't tell the difference because it's what he'd done for us don't see it why I believe everything that Prophet says I believe he was a mild piece of God well why can't you believe what he says about you well I believe he would talk about somebody but I'm not good enough thank you well neither are they you know I mean you name me somebody do you think is good enough you know we are in the days when they can't get somebody to run for president because then every time they start to they're going to start and pull out something hidden in his closet and you pick out somebody this message and you say well that's a perfect person I want to be like them well we dig in the closet a little bit and find out there's some problems there because we're all human beings all around and the waters Galilee he shouted foreign foreign think about it as you're listening to the words of the song turn the water into wine water and wine all around that people don't believe in nothing but the word up there they don't know what kind of a praise and honor that's giving her people have said y'all are just word word people amen amen thank you have you done that in your heart heater on internet around the world today number one and that 40 years ago would have been impossible even for brother Branham right 40 years ago brother random wasn't around the world on any internet system he could be on a telephone hookup across the country but now the message goes around the world you know they got him on there playing 24 hours a day on this message is going around the world gallery multitude that's all the things he's doing in there you know what all he's asking us to do is just be what he said with all anybody in the Bible never minded anything had to believe that God was speaking to them about them and then they cut them out or something that's all he's wanting us to do father we just ask you to be with each one unless everybody on the way home give a safe journey we were waiting Brother Dean and them traveling back let your loving grace be with each one of us be with the sick ones Lord to wander on the internet that are sick that they're hearing this today we pray that by your stripes they are healed and we believe you father we ask you to just forgive us of our many sins and forgive us of being Lord in the wrong way sometimes Maybe but we're just so hard of trying to get the people to see Who We Are who you say we are Lord just have your way and guide us keep us in Jesus name amen anybody pray for brother Aaron be preaching Lord within Wednesday remember each one we love you you dismissed everybody
