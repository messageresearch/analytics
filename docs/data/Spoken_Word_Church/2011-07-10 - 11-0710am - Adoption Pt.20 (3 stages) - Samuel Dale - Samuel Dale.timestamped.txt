[40:41] then remember wade will be preaching
[40:43] this afternoon trying to get these out
[40:45] of the way one side of my notes
[40:47] and then
[40:48] um
[40:49] we have a couple of testimonies and no
[40:51] we prayed there the other day for a
[40:53] little levi
[40:54] and you know the lord touched him and
[40:56] the doctors told him that they just need
[40:59] to take him off a lot of juices so that
[41:01] was that's they can tell you the rest of
[41:03] the story but
[41:04] you know and the lord would take care of
[41:06] everything so just keep praying for him
[41:08] it'll all clear out of his body and get
[41:10] everything in the right order and uh i
[41:13] know sister julie told me this morning
[41:14] about brother gary said it

[41:18] of them and the storms was coming up
[41:20] real bad and he just asked the lord to
[41:22] remove it and take it away and
[41:24] everything's all right so you know rain
[41:26] very little upon them so we believe god

[41:30] still in a delivering business he's
[41:32] still god
[41:34] we thank god for it you know for all of

[41:44] back some of the meetings and things
[41:46] they've been to and so remember these
[41:47] amen did i forget anything else

[41:56] reading in ephesians
[41:58] 1 and then we'll be in romans
[42:01] 8

[42:05] father we thank you for this day and the
[42:07] hour that we're living we thank you
[42:09] because most of all without you what
[42:12] would there be anything we wouldn't even
[42:15] exist because we would not have no way
[42:18] to come without you
[42:20] bringing us into this world we love you
[42:22] and we thank you we cherish you lord and
[42:24] we ask you to just be with us today in
[42:26] your presence
[42:27] as we try to speak about you
[42:30] that you would bless each one lord
[42:32] that's here and those that are by way of
[42:34] internet and things that will be
[42:35] listening we pray that you would just
[42:37] bless each one and the hearts and lives
[42:40] of all the people because that's all
[42:42] we're trying to do is just talk about
[42:44] you
[42:44] and then let you lord make yourself
[42:46] manifest among us because that's what
[42:48] we're looking forward to
[42:49] we love you and we commit everything to
[42:51] you forgive our sins cleanse us from all
[42:54] unrighteousness and guide us in your
[42:56] living grace in jesus name
[42:59] amen
[43:01] remember our wife's going for some
[43:03] testing all this week and uh thing that
[43:06] they're gonna have to do to
[43:07] inject some fluid into her back and i'll
[43:10] do is remember that and remember
[43:12] the things you know that
[43:14] god would be with each one of us
[43:15] ephesians
[43:17] 1
[43:18] verse 3 blessed be the god and father of
[43:20] our lord jesus christ who have blessed
[43:22] us with all spiritual blessings in
[43:23] heavenly places
[43:25] in
[43:26] christ according as he had chosen us in
[43:29] him before the foundation of the world
[43:31] that we should be holding without blame
[43:33] before him in love having predestinated
[43:35] us unto the adoption of children by
[43:37] jesus christ to himself according to the
[43:40] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[43:42] of the glory of his grace wherein he
[43:44] hath made us accepted
[43:47] in the beloved all right go back turn to
[43:50] romans 8.
[43:54] i'm going to start reading it verse 5
[43:58] down through about verse 13
[44:01] then we'll pick up in a minute after
[44:03] we're seated and continue on with it
[44:05] verse 5 says for they that are after the
[44:07] flesh do mind the things of the flesh
[44:10] but they are that that but
[44:13] they that are after the spirit the
[44:15] things of the spirit for to be carnally
[44:17] minded is death but to be spiritually
[44:19] minded is life and peace
[44:20] because the carnal mind is enmity
[44:22] against god for it is not subject to the
[44:24] law of god
[44:26] neither indeed can be so then they that
[44:29] are in the flesh cannot please god but
[44:31] ye are not in the flesh but in the
[44:33] spirit if so be that the spirit of god
[44:36] dwell in you
[44:38] now if any man have not the spirit of
[44:40] christ
[44:41] he is none of his
[44:43] and if christ be in you the body is dead
[44:46] because of sin
[44:48] but the spirit
[44:49] is life because of righteousness
[44:52] but if and the prophet said that's a
[44:54] question page 19 of the rise of the sun
[44:57] if it's dark right
[44:59] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[45:01] jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[45:04] raised up christ from the dead shall
[45:06] also quicken your mortal bodies by his
[45:08] spirit that dwelleth in you
[45:10] therefore in other words conclusion to
[45:12] it
[45:13] brethren we are debtors not to the flesh
[45:16] to live after the flesh
[45:18] for if we live after the flesh we shall
[45:20] die but if we through the spirit do
[45:23] mortify the deeds of the body we shall
[45:26] live you may be seated or that is
[45:28] blessing
[45:29] to the reading of the word now we'll be
[45:31] in
[45:32] romans there
[45:34] uh
[45:36] the message you're so after this i know
[45:39] and so just think on these things
[45:41] you know i'm talking about the romans
[45:43] that just read the scriptures there
[45:45] but
[45:47] see we tried to bring out a point this
[45:49] last wednesday
[45:51] that i hope you had an understanding of
[45:53] what i was trying to say
[45:55] and and everything and
[45:58] that you know people thinks that
[46:02] they're in the message and that makes
[46:04] them
[46:04] you know
[46:05] well we we prove we got the holy ghost
[46:07] we do this that or the other because
[46:09] we're in the message
[46:11] well
[46:12] could it be that we're just like the
[46:14] disciples were that was what i was
[46:15] trying to get across wednesday could it
[46:17] be that
[46:19] we could be like them
[46:21] because there in in luke it says that
[46:24] when jesus appeared among them that he
[46:27] opened their understanding of the
[46:29] scriptures right all right but you know
[46:32] that didn't give the new birth
[46:35] that didn't give them eternal life
[46:38] right
[46:39] that was opening their understanding of
[46:41] the scriptures
[46:42] in preparation
[46:44] for eternal life
[46:46] see in other words making a way or are
[46:49] defining what would have to take place
[46:51] and and how that these things would have
[46:54] to be
[46:55] and that he would have to be crucified
[46:57] and all of that and and give his life if
[47:00] not then we could not have you know
[47:02] eternal life
[47:04] so then you know that's that's the point
[47:06] i was trying to get to us that you know
[47:09] we could say well we've been in the
[47:10] message well oral roberts university has
[47:13] it and
[47:15] is there available for them the students
[47:17] to read so if they read what brother
[47:20] branham said then would it not be that
[47:22] their understanding would be open
[47:25] as to the end time
[47:27] see
[47:28] you know
[47:29] if you can read
[47:31] your understanding can be open but that
[47:33] does not give us eternal life it is not
[47:36] a revelation just because you're able to
[47:38] read
[47:39] to quote
[47:41] to uh the things you know that's not
[47:43] eternal life it's when the word is
[47:46] revealed
[47:47] amen unto us
[47:49] that's eternal life it's not just a
[47:51] quote it's not just you know a concept
[47:54] or a thought the prophet of god said i'm
[47:56] convinced we're not getting people to
[47:59] christ we're getting them to a church
[48:01] now he was it openly to admit that
[48:05] about himself
[48:06] he didn't say now what i'm thinking
[48:08] you're not being able to get them he
[48:09] said now we're not getting right
[48:11] see because he knew that the natural
[48:14] words of a man
[48:16] the the natural things of a man
[48:19] is
[48:20] not going to save us
[48:23] it takes a revelation from al almighty
[48:26] god all right now because we're talking
[48:29] about the stages of redemption and we've
[48:32] been on it now for quite a while this is
[48:34] message number 20 and uh we'll probably
[48:36] be on it 20 more so that's all
[48:38] millennium will take place we'll still
[48:40] be here
[48:41] but
[48:42] you know getting ready yeah
[48:44] but see
[48:47] what i want to do is to make sure you
[48:49] follow with me
[48:51] because we've gotten down to
[48:53] basically verse 23 of romans 8
[48:57] and to talking about to whip
[49:00] the redemption of the body it doesn't
[49:02] say to redeem the body there
[49:05] it it cause that's not the point the
[49:08] point is is to understand to whip
[49:11] to understand the redemption of the body
[49:15] right all right and because if we don't
[49:17] understand the redemption of the body
[49:20] then thereby we will have to go by the
[49:22] grave
[49:24] you know and wait on someone else who
[49:26] can have that understanding and come to
[49:29] the position to bring us out of the
[49:31] grave by their understanding
[49:34] it's not going out to the graveyard and
[49:36] hollering and telling them to come on up
[49:38] i've never believed that you know i
[49:41] didn't believe that as a bad dish but
[49:43] let's see it's not that way
[49:45] but it's to understand how this body can
[49:49] be redeemed right
[49:52] you know
[49:53] and understanding it then see we can
[49:55] come to the position it can be
[49:58] we can quote all we want to it's already
[50:00] redeemed right i mean be sure we can
[50:02] give the quotes and we'll get through
[50:04] those things and read them but it's not
[50:07] redeemed until
[50:09] just like i said about the lord jesus
[50:11] his body was redeemed at the river
[50:13] jordan
[50:14] that's what your prophet said from this
[50:16] part of the earth the future home said
[50:18] i've redeemed this body and i'll come to
[50:20] live in it and said from that part i'll
[50:22] redeem the rest but it was three and a
[50:24] half years before he went into a change
[50:28] and i'll give you a key that he went
[50:30] into a change on the mount of
[50:31] transfiguration
[50:33] before he could go on to
[50:36] uh you might or look up some words
[50:38] around there of you know transfiguration
[50:42] translate
[50:43] glorify
[50:45] glorified
[50:47] i'm just giving you a little
[50:49] idea ahead of time you model to look
[50:51] those things up
[50:53] because we may be missing the point of
[50:56] uh
[50:57] of all of the scriptures and things
[50:59] what's being said because it's just like
[51:01] i'm saying here
[51:02] it doesn't say they're in romans the
[51:04] redemption of the body it says to
[51:06] understand
[51:08] the rejection of the body all right now
[51:11] it can only be understood by the
[51:12] revealed word right would you agree
[51:15] the lord jesus was the only one that
[51:17] understood the rejection of the body
[51:20] because even paul could speak of it
[51:24] but remember you can speak of things and
[51:26] even be
[51:28] god's word
[51:29] when paul said change them on twitter
[51:31] and i etc like that that was god's word
[51:34] but the man himself that said that
[51:37] never attained unto that position
[51:41] so that was waiting for you and i
[51:44] but somebody will have to to come to
[51:46] that place and we'll have to uh you know
[51:49] get there to the point but see now
[51:52] opening our understanding of the
[51:54] scriptures
[51:56] because i think after 40 years we've
[51:59] been at lula this past sunday was our
[52:01] 40th which is actually monday was their
[52:03] 40th uh years here in this church july 4
[52:08] 1971 we started and i believe after 40
[52:11] years we ought to have a little bit of
[52:13] understanding open
[52:15] as i said the other day people would say
[52:17] beware of those who have you know beware
[52:20] of the man that thinks he's got all the
[52:21] answers tonight and i said well be aware
[52:23] of those people after 40 years and don't
[52:25] have any answers at all
[52:27] i mean that's that's
[52:29] you know well i'm just simple you know i
[52:32] just want to be simple well you can be
[52:34] simple and go by the grave
[52:36] but we can get a revelation and have a
[52:38] change of the bible
[52:41] now
[52:42] paul then is giving us understanding
[52:47] to
[52:48] about this redemption
[52:51] because it's got to come from the
[52:52] scriptures
[52:53] right all right
[52:55] so then as we read then now we'll come
[52:57] back to this on the 11th verse and all
[53:00] but we'll come back to see you know that
[53:03] this if the spirit of him that raised up
[53:05] jesus from the dead be in you it'll
[53:06] quicken your mortal body all right we'll
[53:08] get back to that in a minute but i want
[53:10] you to do something with me let's just
[53:12] read the scriptures and go back and turn
[53:14] to romans there now and let's just start
[53:17] off
[53:18] and let's just read the scriptures
[53:21] because
[53:22] to me the scriptures have the answer
[53:25] we were talking about this at the bible
[53:27] study last night
[53:28] and uh see when you're reading the
[53:30] scriptures
[53:32] read the scriptures as
[53:34] uh
[53:35] you know
[53:36] what we've we've cut to a point i guess
[53:39] we call it we want to be so revelated
[53:41] until we read the bible searching for
[53:44] great mysteries
[53:46] and we read over the very simplicity of
[53:48] the mystery that god has revealed
[53:51] to looking for some kind of a mystery
[53:54] you know like uh the bible speaks of a
[53:56] stumbling stone
[53:58] a rock of offense right well you know
[54:00] that was the revelation of jesus christ
[54:02] exactly right
[54:04] but everybody wants to find this and
[54:05] find that and then brother branham's
[54:07] message they want to do this they want
[54:09] to read this and they just read well
[54:11] i've got a quote
[54:14] what is the quote saying right i could
[54:17] take the bible and do like the prophet
[54:18] said maybe he could read the bible and
[54:20] show you go
[54:21] judas went and hung yourself turn over a
[54:23] couple of verses and read go you do
[54:25] likewise you know well i told you the
[54:28] bible
[54:29] right let's see
[54:30] that was you know self-interpretation
[54:33] right upon wording but read the bible
[54:36] and see what the text is in
[54:39] we were talking about life not just as
[54:41] an example talking about
[54:43] hatred
[54:44] or hate
[54:46] which is works of the flesh that we've
[54:47] been on
[54:48] all right
[54:49] and see to take the word hate and run it
[54:52] across it's a big old word but you keep
[54:54] dropping down
[54:56] in the understanding of it
[54:58] and you'll find out that god hates sin
[55:00] right right
[55:03] but he don't hate the sinner
[55:06] so then you gotta break that down
[55:09] as to coming from our word hate
[55:13] and dropping it down to see that god can
[55:16] hate and you can hate sin or you can
[55:18] hate this that or the other and it not
[55:20] be scripturally wrong
[55:22] but it's according to your understanding
[55:25] so then you've got to go in and read
[55:26] what it's talking about and i was
[55:28] illustrating to them last night you go
[55:30] look it up in your strong's concordance
[55:32] that the word spirit
[55:34] where it's like re you know you're
[55:36] reading like in you see spirit
[55:38] they
[55:39] they don't give you a difference between
[55:41] the word from spirit speaking of holy
[55:44] spirit than they do from the word spirit
[55:46] speaking of man's spirit
[55:49] it's just using the word spirit
[55:51] all right and see then doing it you must
[55:54] read the before
[55:56] and the after to see whether it's
[55:58] talking about the holy spirit or man's
[56:01] spirit
[56:02] but the bible's got its own answer right
[56:05] you know and we just read the before and
[56:07] after part of it and we can understand
[56:09] so let's just read now
[56:11] see paul is putting the
[56:13] things in and we we've got down to our
[56:15] this past wednesday and a little bit the
[56:18] sunday evening i think it was or the
[56:20] wednesday before i forget when i
[56:22] preached a lot of times but we had got
[56:24] down to talking about the scripture in
[56:26] romans 8 30 that those who he justified
[56:29] he had already glorified right
[56:32] all right now what i want you to do is
[56:35] think with me as we read
[56:38] we're going to read from verse 20 where
[56:41] we'll start verse 14 to save time but no
[56:44] let's drop back to verse 11 in romans
[56:46] and let's read all the way over to verse
[56:49] 30
[56:50] or 31 right along in there
[56:52] all right see because paul
[56:55] if he's going to tell you about the to
[56:59] wit
[57:01] you know
[57:02] the redemption of the body
[57:04] in other words we need an understanding
[57:06] paul is saying right
[57:09] we need an
[57:10] adoption we need a bringing forth of god
[57:14] to the position
[57:16] that we can have a man of
[57:17] transfiguration experience within our
[57:20] hearts and lives that will bring us to
[57:23] the full opening of the word right and a
[57:25] full understanding because brother brown
[57:27] covers matthew 17 you know and how that
[57:30] even thou represented moses and elijah
[57:33] and the things that was represented and
[57:35] then seeing jesus glorified
[57:37] but in doing it
[57:39] see paul speaks we can talk about how
[57:41] justified he's already glorified
[57:44] but see what i want you to see is how
[57:45] that's done
[57:47] well what do you mean it's just this is
[57:49] just done it's just no
[57:51] there has to be a way for it to be done
[57:55] and you know so say these notes if i
[57:57] don't get through with them i'll pick it
[57:58] back up wednesday night i mean the
[58:00] quotes i'm giving you all right let's
[58:01] just start in verse
[58:03] because we just read down through what
[58:04] it's talking about to be carnally minded
[58:06] if you yield to the flesh then you know
[58:09] it would be wrong but let's start with
[58:11] verse 11 and just read it and just make
[58:14] a few comments as we go along
[58:16] and remember my point
[58:19] when paul finishes it up talking about
[58:22] glorified
[58:23] he has explained to us
[58:26] the understanding or giving us the
[58:29] understanding of how this adoption to
[58:33] wit is going to take place
[58:36] now see that's the way you need to read
[58:38] the bible
[58:40] read it to get an understanding out of
[58:42] it but don't read it to try to figure it
[58:43] out
[58:45] because if you try to figure it out
[58:46] you're going to get further away
[58:48] just read what it says and let god tell
[58:50] you what it says amen and then you don't
[58:52] have to change it right see you can read
[58:55] it for yourself that way because that's
[58:57] the way i read all right
[59:00] verse 10 and if christ be in you the
[59:02] body is dead because of sin but the
[59:04] spirit is light because of righteousness
[59:08] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[59:10] jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[59:12] raised up christ from the dead shall
[59:14] also quicken your mortal bodies how
[59:17] by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[59:21] this is not an exterior thing right
[59:24] right
[59:25] you know
[59:26] this is not an anointing to fall
[59:29] down from somewhere right that is to
[59:32] bring these things the anointing is
[59:34] supposed to be within you amen if you
[59:36] have the spirit of christ that's why the
[59:38] prophet said rise in the sun there's a
[59:40] question if you have it right if you
[59:43] have the spirit of christ it can quicken
[59:45] your mortal body all right see
[59:48] what therefore brethren we are debtors
[59:50] not to the flesh
[59:52] to live after the flesh
[59:54] for we live after the flesh
[59:56] for if ye live after the flesh he shall
[59:58] die
[59:59] much
[1:00:00] but he threw the spirit
[1:00:02] the inward man
[1:00:05] not as i said now just an anointing
[1:00:07] falling down
[1:00:08] from the inward man
[1:00:11] must come forth
[1:00:13] something that will be able to mortify
[1:00:18] the deeds of the body
[1:00:21] if it does we can live right
[1:00:25] from the inside out i gave you some
[1:00:27] quotes we'll get to it after a while
[1:00:29] your resurrection is inside of you
[1:00:32] all right
[1:00:33] see then it's from the inside out that
[1:00:35] things take place all right now what's
[1:00:37] he saying for as many verse 14 as
[1:00:39] they're led by the spirit of god they
[1:00:42] are the sons of god they and they only
[1:00:44] the original city
[1:00:47] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:00:49] bondage again to fear but ye have
[1:00:51] received the spirit of adoption
[1:00:53] whereby we cry out by the father
[1:00:57] now there is the stage one we've been
[1:00:59] talking about there's the new birth amen
[1:01:03] that's what he's saying over here if the
[1:01:05] spirit of christ be in you
[1:01:07] then he gets to verse
[1:01:09] 13 and he's still on that point that
[1:01:12] it's got to be the spirit that is within
[1:01:14] you
[1:01:15] if the spirit is within you then it can
[1:01:17] mortify
[1:01:18] or die make to die
[1:01:20] the deeds of the flesh you know the body
[1:01:23] of mankind
[1:01:24] and now he's telling you how this being
[1:01:26] done what by the spirit that is within
[1:01:28] you
[1:01:29] for you have not received the spirit of
[1:01:31] bondage again to fear but ye have
[1:01:32] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:01:35] we cry out by father now watch the
[1:01:37] spirit itself beareth witness with our
[1:01:40] spirit that what that we are the
[1:01:42] children of god right
[1:01:45] right
[1:01:47] by the new birth
[1:01:49] right we are the children of god amen
[1:01:52] that's right
[1:01:53] now he's not talking about human fleshly
[1:01:56] right
[1:01:58] right human flesh live with our children
[1:02:00] of the world and they're really the
[1:02:02] children of the devil right people don't
[1:02:04] like that you know they think there's a
[1:02:06] body so great and glorious but just
[1:02:08] remember it ain't worth nothing
[1:02:11] all right so what does he say verse 16
[1:02:13] the spirit
[1:02:15] now that's holy spirit why because it's
[1:02:17] referring not just because it's spelled
[1:02:19] with a capital point but because it's
[1:02:22] referring to the point
[1:02:24] of where it's at the spirit itself
[1:02:26] beareth witness with our spirits
[1:02:29] all right
[1:02:30] now
[1:02:31] what that we are the children of god and
[1:02:34] his children
[1:02:36] look at the position the newborn baby
[1:02:38] comes into
[1:02:39] and his children then heirs
[1:02:42] heirs of god
[1:02:44] now what do you get from god eternal
[1:02:46] life
[1:02:48] right
[1:02:49] eternal life
[1:02:52] heirs of god you get eternal life see
[1:02:55] and join ours with christ
[1:02:58] now
[1:02:59] what does that mean and join ours with
[1:03:01] christ
[1:03:04] whatever he inherits we inherit
[1:03:08] all right
[1:03:10] you say yeah but he was god i agree with
[1:03:12] you he was god and that's the point of
[1:03:14] it if we're the children of god
[1:03:18] we can only be the children of god by
[1:03:20] the spirit of god that came from jesus
[1:03:22] christ and his crucifixion
[1:03:24] all right see then we're joint heirs
[1:03:27] not of just eternal life
[1:03:32] the bible says that we're out of all
[1:03:33] things
[1:03:35] right i've listened to the book of
[1:03:36] revelation where we're heir of all
[1:03:38] things
[1:03:39] all right
[1:03:40] now if we're out of all things in this
[1:03:42] world and all the other things it's not
[1:03:44] just a spiritual new word there
[1:03:47] we're heir of all things what by being
[1:03:49] joined ours with christ
[1:03:51] what did he do he came down and
[1:03:53] inherited this world
[1:03:55] because he came out of this world you
[1:03:58] agree to the son of man came out of this
[1:04:00] earth the body
[1:04:02] and that way then he'll always have the
[1:04:04] connection to this body you know this
[1:04:06] earth and the things i get the point now
[1:04:09] i i'm wanting to get down but
[1:04:11] it's hard to do without
[1:04:14] and if children do the heirs of god and
[1:04:17] join heirs with christ
[1:04:20] if so be that we suffer with him
[1:04:23] that we may be also glorified together
[1:04:26] amen
[1:04:28] amen
[1:04:29] have you ever looked up
[1:04:31] i'm giving you an assignment okay
[1:04:34] have you ever looked up glorified
[1:04:37] i don't need to look back i know what it
[1:04:39] is
[1:04:40] all right what is it
[1:04:46] he is not talking
[1:04:49] about your mortal
[1:04:52] being
[1:04:55] your mortal being is involved
[1:04:58] right
[1:05:00] so i'd go home and look up glorified and
[1:05:02] why you had it look up trends
[1:05:04] transfigured
[1:05:06] translated
[1:05:09] uh look these words up
[1:05:12] you might find some interesting things
[1:05:13] that we'll begin to discuss about it
[1:05:15] okay
[1:05:16] because remember we are still here
[1:05:19] that's my point
[1:05:21] okay
[1:05:22] we're still here
[1:05:26] we can read that we're already glorified
[1:05:30] you see it may take don't tell us how
[1:05:32] many years for that to take place to
[1:05:34] bring us into
[1:05:36] an immortal body right amen and there's
[1:05:38] a lot of stages between here and there
[1:05:42] so look at that okay
[1:05:45] see because i wrote it like this what i
[1:05:47] want us to notice is the point
[1:05:51] paul's saying we're already glorified in
[1:05:53] verse 30 there
[1:05:55] you know 8 and 30.
[1:05:59] but he's showing us that the the
[1:06:02] understanding in verse 23 of to wit the
[1:06:05] understanding
[1:06:06] of the adoption is what's going to bring
[1:06:09] us to the state of complete
[1:06:11] glorification
[1:06:13] all right so now that's what we're
[1:06:14] trying to read all right verse 18. for i
[1:06:17] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:06:19] present time are not worthy to be
[1:06:20] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:06:22] revealed in us
[1:06:25] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:06:27] creature waited for the manifestation of
[1:06:29] the sons of god
[1:06:31] waiting for the sons and daughters of
[1:06:33] god to make god manifest
[1:06:36] right
[1:06:37] because how did we cover it manifest is
[1:06:39] to make known we are to make god known
[1:06:44] by preaching the gospel telling people
[1:06:45] about jesus christ witnessing etc
[1:06:48] and then what does he do he makes us
[1:06:50] known
[1:06:51] right by signs and wonders and things
[1:06:54] like that right
[1:06:56] so then we need to read that and get the
[1:06:59] understanding see making known to the
[1:07:00] sons of god for the creature now that's
[1:07:03] whole creation everything
[1:07:05] was made subject to vanity in other
[1:07:07] words put under the fall
[1:07:08] right
[1:07:11] not willingly see not of its own but by
[1:07:14] reason of him who has subjected the same
[1:07:16] in
[1:07:17] hope
[1:07:21] in hope
[1:07:25] the world has a hope
[1:07:28] the animals have a hope
[1:07:30] the trees
[1:07:32] the creation
[1:07:33] has a hope
[1:07:36] right that's it all right and if they
[1:07:38] can see and they saw it for a moment
[1:07:41] in the manifestation of the prophet of
[1:07:43] god in our day now the lord jesus
[1:07:45] manifested in fullness
[1:07:48] but in our prophet in the last days with
[1:07:50] the storms et cetera the things
[1:07:54] nature saw its master
[1:07:58] because that's what we're supposed to be
[1:08:00] to speak a storm out of existence
[1:08:02] right
[1:08:03] it
[1:08:04] shows that those things are back into
[1:08:06] being
[1:08:07] for the sick to be healed shows those
[1:08:09] things are dire all right now watch them
[1:08:11] see but now remember it only brings the
[1:08:14] world and the creation to a hope
[1:08:22] which is an expectation of fulfillment
[1:08:26] you know basically at a later time would
[1:08:29] be the best definition of hope in other
[1:08:31] words i hope
[1:08:32] all right now watch we get them down in
[1:08:34] just a minute and what's that word
[1:08:36] so that's that's the creation
[1:08:39] which might subject to vanity not
[1:08:40] willing to but by reason of him who has
[1:08:42] subjected the same in hope
[1:08:45] me
[1:08:46] all right
[1:08:47] because the creature itself also shall
[1:08:49] be delivered from the glorious bondage
[1:08:51] of corruption into the glorious liberty
[1:08:53] of the children of god that's why it
[1:08:55] brings a hope to the world right
[1:08:58] look at all the earthquakes and the
[1:08:59] things are around the world don't you
[1:09:01] think the world is like you know uh
[1:09:03] would like to be delivered amen
[1:09:06] for we know that the whole creation
[1:09:07] growth and travail
[1:09:10] everything groaning and travailing
[1:09:12] mankind the world etc creation
[1:09:16] in pain together until now
[1:09:19] now bring that now on over here
[1:09:23] because he's prophesying bringing it
[1:09:25] down so it's down to where we are now
[1:09:27] all right i like the way brother brown
[1:09:29] says christ the mystery of god revealed
[1:09:30] he said to see how this is unfolded that
[1:09:32] step down into this present hour
[1:09:36] you know he brought it right down to
[1:09:37] where we're living all right what's now
[1:09:41] and not only they but ourselves also
[1:09:43] which have the first fruits of the
[1:09:44] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[1:09:46] ourselves waiting
[1:09:49] for the adoption
[1:09:50] to wit the redemption of our body
[1:09:54] waiting
[1:09:58] paul is saying that he's waiting he's
[1:10:00] saying i'm not dire
[1:10:04] i'm not at that point
[1:10:07] right to fully understand
[1:10:10] i've even spoken of it
[1:10:13] in the spirit you know change them on
[1:10:15] twinkle 9 all of this and the other he's
[1:10:17] even told us how it would be that the
[1:10:18] lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:10:20] with a shout the voice of an archangel
[1:10:22] that was great that's a revelation to
[1:10:24] the prophet
[1:10:26] you know paul but he never reached it
[1:10:28] right
[1:10:30] he had to go by the grave
[1:10:31] see because he knew that something was
[1:10:33] going to happen like brother rather said
[1:10:35] he was trying to get us to see that god
[1:10:38] wasn't coming then
[1:10:40] that's what paul was doing see we
[1:10:42] thought paul was saying oh you'll be
[1:10:43] here in 15 minutes and i get to
[1:10:45] preaching
[1:10:46] no
[1:10:47] he was trying to get it out of her of
[1:10:49] the minds of people that he was coming
[1:10:51] there
[1:10:53] there would have to be things of falling
[1:10:54] away that have to be all kind of things
[1:10:56] would transpire before it could make it
[1:10:58] into the finality all right now listen
[1:11:03] people what's it doing even our our
[1:11:06] sales grown within ourselves
[1:11:08] waiting for the adoption to wit the
[1:11:12] redemption of our body
[1:11:14] now paul wanted the redemption of the
[1:11:16] body
[1:11:17] he prophesied of the redemption of the
[1:11:19] body but he never experienced the
[1:11:22] redeeming of the body
[1:11:24] right he could say it by spirit
[1:11:29] that we're already glorified
[1:11:31] he could tell us how it would transpire
[1:11:34] to change the moment twinkle line the
[1:11:35] lord said he could tell us all those
[1:11:37] things but he never achieved that
[1:11:38] position right
[1:11:42] so then that means somebody's going to
[1:11:44] have to reach that place right right
[1:11:45] amen
[1:11:47] and paul is laying there brother dick
[1:11:50] talks about it in hebrews 11 40 i guess
[1:11:52] it is where they without us cannot be
[1:11:54] made perfect
[1:11:57] they're waiting on us right amen what
[1:12:00] they said was reality but they're
[1:12:01] waiting on us
[1:12:05] whatever anybody would think about
[1:12:07] brother branham coming back to
[1:12:08] resurrection and preaching and all that
[1:12:10] it's still dependent upon the people of
[1:12:12] god to get that back here that's right
[1:12:14] amen because if not what is the
[1:12:16] dependence that's right
[1:12:18] see then when he comes back he can
[1:12:20] preach all he wants to do without 30 40
[1:12:21] days
[1:12:23] we know as i sit there and look at what
[1:12:25] the lord
[1:12:26] resurrection no no no it's not going to
[1:12:28] be that way right
[1:12:30] but that's all right
[1:12:32] now watch then after he says this now
[1:12:36] that he's waiting
[1:12:38] for the adoption to wit the redemption
[1:12:40] of the body
[1:12:42] look what paul says
[1:12:48] for we are saved by hope
[1:12:50] right
[1:12:52] now paul didn't say
[1:12:54] but i hope i'm saved
[1:12:56] now that's not to understand it all
[1:12:58] right
[1:13:01] this hope is not the understanding of
[1:13:03] the verse
[1:13:04] up above there that we stopped and
[1:13:06] identified on verse 20 that the whole
[1:13:08] creation was subject to the same in hope
[1:13:12] the world only has a hope of being
[1:13:14] changed that's right
[1:13:16] all right
[1:13:18] but we better have more than a hope
[1:13:21] listen because he explains that for we
[1:13:23] are saved by hope
[1:13:27] not hoping he's saved
[1:13:30] watching
[1:13:32] but hope that is seen
[1:13:35] is not hope
[1:13:38] what is hope that is saying faith
[1:13:41] right
[1:13:44] right faith is the substance of things
[1:13:47] hoped for
[1:13:49] the evidence of things not seen faith is
[1:13:52] not hope
[1:13:53] that's right paul explains that
[1:13:56] see watching for we are saved by hope
[1:13:59] but hope that his scene is not saved for
[1:14:01] what a man sees
[1:14:02] what did he yet hope for it
[1:14:05] brother said why would i want a shirt
[1:14:07] i've got one
[1:14:12] he said that's a scientific fact
[1:14:16] that i have on a shirt
[1:14:19] see this is where he's getting it from
[1:14:21] that's what paul's saying
[1:14:25] we start out as people in the gospel of
[1:14:28] hearing about jesus christ
[1:14:31] we hear about eternal life we hear about
[1:14:34] uh the change of glorification we hear
[1:14:36] about all of the things
[1:14:38] you know what that does that brings a
[1:14:39] hope to you
[1:14:42] right right because it puts us with the
[1:14:44] rest of the world
[1:14:46] but once that is made in revelation
[1:14:50] you're no longer hoping for it right
[1:14:54] if you have eternal life you're not
[1:14:55] hoping for eternal life that's right
[1:15:02] it's already a reality that's what he's
[1:15:04] saying
[1:15:05] for
[1:15:06] we are saved by hope
[1:15:08] but hope that is seen is not hope
[1:15:11] for what a man see it
[1:15:13] why did he
[1:15:15] yet hope for it
[1:15:16] listen
[1:15:17] but if we hope
[1:15:20] for that we see not
[1:15:25] now
[1:15:26] right
[1:15:27] paul
[1:15:29] by the understanding from the scriptures
[1:15:32] and the revelation
[1:15:35] had a revelation of the change
[1:15:37] of faith the substance
[1:15:40] but you know what at that point of time
[1:15:44] it has only brought a hope
[1:15:47] of reality into him
[1:15:49] now more than
[1:15:50] than i'm saved hoping i'm going to be
[1:15:53] changed
[1:15:56] right
[1:15:57] paul would say i hope i'm going to be
[1:15:58] changed after he doesn't sing the change
[1:16:02] it just brought a reality of life that
[1:16:05] one day this will take place but while
[1:16:07] i'm still here
[1:16:09] i'm having to wait
[1:16:14] i'm having to wait
[1:16:16] all right do you understand what he's
[1:16:18] saying but if we hope for that we see
[1:16:21] not
[1:16:23] know what
[1:16:24] then do we with patience wait for it
[1:16:31] this message has brought a hulk to you
[1:16:33] and i yes
[1:16:36] now come on
[1:16:39] you know that we basically believed
[1:16:41] before the prophet came
[1:16:42] that we were going to get a new body
[1:16:45] right
[1:16:47] all right
[1:16:48] so through the opening of the
[1:16:50] understanding of the scriptures by way
[1:16:52] of the prophet messenger
[1:16:54] we ought to at least come to hope
[1:16:58] and brother adam will say it like that
[1:17:00] he said you mean there's a hope for a
[1:17:02] change of these bodies
[1:17:08] he's not just hoping
[1:17:11] right he's saying right
[1:17:14] paul is not hoping
[1:17:16] he's saying what i've seen by revelation
[1:17:20] right
[1:17:21] right will one day have to come into
[1:17:23] reality because i've got the substance
[1:17:26] right that's right
[1:17:28] there's where we got to come to
[1:17:31] see to wit to understand
[1:17:34] to have a revelation
[1:17:36] not to just have an intellectual concept
[1:17:39] or a thought of of the redemption of the
[1:17:41] body
[1:17:42] but it's like i've told you then how
[1:17:44] come my lord half of the people this
[1:17:46] message probably still believes gonna
[1:17:48] get a new body after all the prophets
[1:17:49] said in the bible saying well you can
[1:17:51] see that it didn't get a hole well i
[1:17:53] guess that's what excuse me they got a
[1:17:54] hole
[1:17:57] they gotta hope they don't have a
[1:17:58] salvation they don't have a reality
[1:18:00] so all they've got is a hope
[1:18:03] but see
[1:18:05] why would i hope for a pair of glasses
[1:18:07] i've got them in my hand
[1:18:10] right
[1:18:11] i can see it
[1:18:15] why do i hope for it
[1:18:18] what do i desire for i've got it better
[1:18:24] see i already have the thing in reality
[1:18:27] and one day when we're changed
[1:18:31] we will then have in reality right
[1:18:36] what has been a hope within us
[1:18:39] brought by the revelation of the
[1:18:40] scriptures
[1:18:43] it's like the lord jesus said
[1:18:45] for three and a half years
[1:18:48] he was the revelation amen
[1:18:51] but his dependence was upon the
[1:18:53] scripture right amen
[1:18:56] brother brown said he died on the cross
[1:18:59] believing in one scripture
[1:19:02] not leave his soul in hell or suffer my
[1:19:04] holy one to seek reduction
[1:19:09] he believed that
[1:19:11] but he was waiting
[1:19:13] for it to be translated you know we're
[1:19:15] taking place
[1:19:16] he had went through a matter of
[1:19:17] transfiguration experience
[1:19:20] of showing pure glorification
[1:19:26] joining glorified right
[1:19:29] but yet hanging there or being beat how
[1:19:31] do you think he felt
[1:19:34] right don't think he felt now when they
[1:19:37] get to beating me i'm i'm gonna be
[1:19:39] glorified
[1:19:40] i don't know i don't quite think that
[1:19:42] away folks
[1:19:43] i don't think you and i would do it
[1:19:45] right
[1:19:46] he was going through pain and agony
[1:19:49] but he had to
[1:19:50] because that was the word amen
[1:19:53] that had to be fulfilled
[1:19:56] see we we've got scriptures i tried to
[1:19:58] preach that remember a few weeks or
[1:20:00] months or so ago that there's a word for
[1:20:02] each age
[1:20:05] we've got scriptures for this age that
[1:20:07] we must fulfill
[1:20:10] because all scriptures got to be
[1:20:12] fulfilled
[1:20:14] i don't agree with the man you know what
[1:20:15] said him and bill was talking and said
[1:20:17] they're talking about scriptures it
[1:20:18] wouldn't even be fulfilled well i i
[1:20:20] can't go along with that i don't care
[1:20:22] what the man says or what he thought
[1:20:23] brother ryan said i got too much where
[1:20:25] brother brown said all the scriptures
[1:20:26] got to be fulfilled
[1:20:28] i just can't go that way
[1:20:31] you know maybe he heard something but he
[1:20:33] didn't hear the right way
[1:20:35] right but listen
[1:20:38] so paul says
[1:20:41] why would i hope for something if i see
[1:20:42] it right
[1:20:44] but until i see that
[1:20:49] until i see it
[1:20:51] i can see it now by revelation
[1:20:54] changing them on the twinkling of an eye
[1:20:55] and see how it's done the lord himself
[1:20:57] feel the sin
[1:20:58] i can see all of those things
[1:21:01] but it brings me to a hope of reality
[1:21:04] not a hope right
[1:21:06] raise the word hope i see above from the
[1:21:09] point amen
[1:21:11] he had a revelation about the change but
[1:21:14] the change is not transpired
[1:21:17] we can have a revelation of the change
[1:21:20] but until the the revelation is
[1:21:22] transpired and we are changed it brings
[1:21:24] us to a hope right
[1:21:27] i hope there is more than i hope i'm
[1:21:29] going to be changed
[1:21:31] it's a reality but it's a fact that you
[1:21:33] can't see it that's right amen
[1:21:37] you say i see it by faith that's true
[1:21:42] you're healing my stretch i'm healed
[1:21:44] it's revealed to you it may be a long
[1:21:46] time before it's a reality
[1:21:50] because that's
[1:21:52] where you're coming back then to a hope
[1:21:54] of that not a hope i'm saying hope i'm
[1:21:56] healed no get the point
[1:22:00] there has to be somewhere in between
[1:22:02] their understanding of a word
[1:22:04] that is to be brought to the basis that
[1:22:06] we can actually what we've seen in the
[1:22:08] in the prophet's message brings that
[1:22:10] hope to you and i
[1:22:14] of a change
[1:22:15] of reality
[1:22:17] through the opening of the word all
[1:22:19] right now watch what he says
[1:22:22] now he's laying his background
[1:22:25] and get what i'm saying they lay in his
[1:22:27] background
[1:22:29] to be able to say something
[1:22:32] all right
[1:22:33] so he goes through that it's not hope if
[1:22:36] it you can see it it's not hope but if
[1:22:38] until you see it it's still hanging on
[1:22:40] to something aren't watching
[1:22:42] likewise in other words exactly like
[1:22:45] or this is what it is the verse 26
[1:22:48] likewise the spirit also helpeth our
[1:22:51] infirmities right amen
[1:22:53] but how am i going to get from
[1:22:56] what i've said
[1:22:58] about the change
[1:22:59] to a reality of the change
[1:23:04] now how am i going to get there
[1:23:07] because there's a vast gap between the
[1:23:09] two that's right
[1:23:12] so watch what he says he said the spirit
[1:23:14] there's the key
[1:23:16] that's in you you know
[1:23:18] it'll change your mortal body the spirit
[1:23:20] also helped with their infirmities
[1:23:25] when jesus was in the garden yielding
[1:23:26] himself over and finally come to the
[1:23:28] position it says the angels come and
[1:23:30] minister them to it that's right when he
[1:23:32] was out in the wilderness you know am i
[1:23:33] not in the desert forty days and forty
[1:23:36] nights that said the angels come and
[1:23:37] minister to them
[1:23:39] see the spirit helpeth our infirmities
[1:23:43] for we know not what we should pray for
[1:23:46] as we ought
[1:23:49] good pointing
[1:23:51] the spirit's one's gonna take care of
[1:23:53] things
[1:23:56] for we know not what we should pray for
[1:23:58] as we all
[1:24:00] but the spirit itself makes intercession
[1:24:02] for us
[1:24:03] with drawings which cannot be uttered
[1:24:10] that's not speaking in tongues
[1:24:13] because these are things that cannot be
[1:24:15] uttered right
[1:24:18] and you've got known and unknown tongues
[1:24:20] but these are things that cannot be
[1:24:22] uttered
[1:24:24] have you ever been to the place to work
[1:24:26] that you were so burdened about
[1:24:27] something
[1:24:30] and it just you know you're just so
[1:24:32] burdened and so heavily burdened about
[1:24:34] someone that's sick or or something or
[1:24:37] like brother gary burdened about the
[1:24:39] fact that there's two roofs out there
[1:24:40] that's off of the house
[1:24:42] see and you need to be fixed before it
[1:24:45] rains
[1:24:46] right see
[1:24:48] all right then what do you do you pray
[1:24:51] right
[1:24:52] and then the spirit says all is willing
[1:24:56] so he goes and tells his helpers their
[1:24:57] word and then tells his efforts julian
[1:24:59] told me he said
[1:25:00] it'll be all right
[1:25:01] have you ever been that away amen
[1:25:04] you ever been to the place that had
[1:25:05] finally just come to a sweet peace you
[1:25:06] just said
[1:25:08] all as well
[1:25:10] i don't care how god does it all as well
[1:25:12] i mean he can put a funnel down and hang
[1:25:14] plastic out of heaven if he wants to and
[1:25:16] cover the two houses whatever he wants
[1:25:17] to do right
[1:25:21] but see we don't think about that as
[1:25:23] being the fulfillment which all that
[1:25:25] would you know some well it's like the
[1:25:26] kids you know that wanted the mountain
[1:25:28] to be moved because they were sick and
[1:25:29] everything
[1:25:30] and they asked the lady and they said
[1:25:32] well yeah we could pray and they went
[1:25:33] out and prayed
[1:25:35] well it didn't work too good and they go
[1:25:36] get their little buckets and they move a
[1:25:38] little bit well it still didn't work too
[1:25:40] good but you know what happened one day
[1:25:41] they come in there and said we're going
[1:25:42] to build a highway right down through
[1:25:44] here and said to do that we're going to
[1:25:45] move that hill out of the way well you
[1:25:47] know what
[1:25:48] i was going to do it
[1:25:50] he hurt him little kid that's right it
[1:25:52] was his way of taking care of him he
[1:25:54] blasts the whole thing away or he can
[1:25:55] send somebody to move the thing
[1:25:57] see whatever he wants to do but listen
[1:25:59] to all right
[1:26:00] i keep doing that won't get on what i
[1:26:02] want to
[1:26:05] and he that searcheth the hearts
[1:26:08] knoweth what is the mind of the spirit
[1:26:13] he that searches the hearts
[1:26:16] knoweth what is the mind he knows
[1:26:17] whether our spirit is right or not
[1:26:20] he knows whether our intention is right
[1:26:21] right exactly he said why we told us
[1:26:24] somebody there one time why you want to
[1:26:25] be healed where you can go back to the
[1:26:27] world
[1:26:28] we were talking about it last night you
[1:26:29] know that brother around and told those
[1:26:31] people
[1:26:33] they were oil well drillers and he told
[1:26:34] those people he said i know where the
[1:26:36] oil is
[1:26:38] they said well tell us
[1:26:40] we'll drill it we'll give them money
[1:26:41] we'll donate it all we'll do this out of
[1:26:43] the other something like this
[1:26:45] no no
[1:26:47] you wouldn't tell them they drilled and
[1:26:49] didn't get but just little things you
[1:26:50] know he said then here comes somebody
[1:26:52] alone had nothing to do with any of it
[1:26:54] sets down one all well and his sculpture
[1:26:56] he said i knew where today
[1:26:59] let's see what he knew also that their
[1:27:02] intentions oh yeah we'll donate it all
[1:27:05] but he knew they're gonna slide a little
[1:27:06] back and
[1:27:08] you know something you know okay
[1:27:10] go ahead
[1:27:15] and he that searches the hearts knoweth
[1:27:17] what is the mind of the spirit because
[1:27:19] he maketh intercession for the saints
[1:27:21] according to the will of god now god's
[1:27:24] will is his word okay
[1:27:26] trying to get rid of and we know that
[1:27:27] all things work together for good to
[1:27:30] them that love god to them who are they
[1:27:32] called according to his purpose now here
[1:27:34] he is right in the middle of expressing
[1:27:38] the understanding of the redemption
[1:27:43] and he's telling you how it's to take
[1:27:44] place
[1:27:45] and right in the middle of it he looks
[1:27:47] like he's just losing the whole thing
[1:27:48] and lost his whole point and start
[1:27:50] talking about you know well
[1:27:52] according to his with purpose
[1:27:55] listen for whom he did for no
[1:27:59] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[1:28:04] now to be
[1:28:06] and conformed both are
[1:28:08] future tense points
[1:28:11] see that's why that everybody looks back
[1:28:13] and say i'm already this
[1:28:16] i'm already this that's in god's mind
[1:28:19] i'm already glorified that's in god's
[1:28:20] mind
[1:28:23] but there is a to be conformed down
[1:28:27] that's here
[1:28:28] there's a place here that we've got to
[1:28:30] reach what he has already said we'd
[1:28:32] reach you agree
[1:28:35] see we look at it well i'm already
[1:28:37] glorified
[1:28:40] look danny said as a man told him it
[1:28:42] works and well i don't never see him i
[1:28:44] don't see him daily like people say
[1:28:49] he's trying to make a point
[1:28:50] and there is a truth to what the man
[1:28:52] would be saying but it's not the truth
[1:28:56] i'm going to say it this way because one
[1:28:58] thing he's not in this message so he
[1:28:59] wouldn't know any way to get to the
[1:29:00] truth
[1:29:01] the other would be a point that he's
[1:29:03] just making a statement because of of
[1:29:05] what he's wanting to take place
[1:29:08] but there is a truth that we don't sin
[1:29:10] but then the truth is that we sin every
[1:29:12] day that's right amen
[1:29:15] right right that's what paul's
[1:29:17] expressing through here life and doings
[1:29:20] and saying thee
[1:29:21] all right for what for whom he did for
[1:29:24] no
[1:29:25] that was before
[1:29:27] he also did predestinate looking to the
[1:29:29] future
[1:29:31] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:29:34] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:29:35] many brethren
[1:29:37] now watch after all that's doing paul
[1:29:40] how are we going to get this to
[1:29:41] understand the redemption of the body
[1:29:44] moreover
[1:29:45] whom he did predestinate
[1:29:48] then he also called
[1:29:51] and whom he called
[1:29:53] then he also justified
[1:29:58] in whom he justified
[1:30:01] then he also glorified amen
[1:30:06] now
[1:30:08] that is god saying what he sees about
[1:30:11] you and i that's right amen
[1:30:13] he sees us already glorified
[1:30:17] but if we don't go through the stages in
[1:30:19] the correct order
[1:30:21] of understanding
[1:30:23] in other words we must go through
[1:30:24] justification
[1:30:25] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[1:30:28] ghost to have eternal life for the
[1:30:30] spirit of god to be dwelling inside of
[1:30:32] us other than that it's an anointing
[1:30:34] upon
[1:30:35] amen justification and sanctification is
[1:30:38] a washing and cleansing but it's the
[1:30:40] anointing is basically upon you as an
[1:30:42] outward part
[1:30:44] but then when it becomes into the soul
[1:30:47] by the new birth then you have eternal
[1:30:49] life
[1:30:51] then and only then can you start
[1:30:53] thinking about glorification
[1:30:56] right
[1:30:59] agreed
[1:31:02] yeah but i believe everybody no
[1:31:04] everybody ain't going to be there
[1:31:06] that's right
[1:31:09] only those that are are true are going
[1:31:11] to be there
[1:31:13] only those that are born again are going
[1:31:15] to be there
[1:31:17] we wish that it would be for everybody
[1:31:21] but if if they don't have it
[1:31:24] and if we have eternal life today we
[1:31:26] will prove whether or not we have
[1:31:27] eternal life
[1:31:29] because we'll come to the message of the
[1:31:30] hour right amen
[1:31:32] if we don't come to the message hour we
[1:31:34] differ with it and we prove we don't
[1:31:35] have eternal life
[1:31:37] but we're just anointed with things but
[1:31:39] see look what paul is saying
[1:31:42] paul how am i going to come to an
[1:31:43] understanding
[1:31:48] for this the understanding i want the
[1:31:50] understanding paul
[1:31:52] of what's going to be of the redemption
[1:31:54] of my body
[1:31:59] and he says
[1:32:02] are you born again
[1:32:05] he said yes i'm born again
[1:32:09] he said are you going through the stages
[1:32:11] of adoption
[1:32:14] and only this age can go through those
[1:32:15] things right
[1:32:18] he said
[1:32:22] do you really believe the word
[1:32:29] then
[1:32:30] your redemption
[1:32:32] lies within you amen
[1:32:38] it's in christ
[1:32:41] that is within you
[1:32:43] all right
[1:32:45] and by being in christ
[1:32:49] then
[1:32:50] our glorification is already within
[1:32:52] sight of us
[1:32:55] waiting to a time to be brought into
[1:32:58] reality
[1:33:01] we said i want to tell you
[1:33:05] so let's bring that if over from verse
[1:33:07] 11 because the prophet emphasizes faith
[1:33:10] 19 it's a rising sun
[1:33:12] he said see
[1:33:13] he put a question there
[1:33:15] if the spirit
[1:33:18] of christ be in you
[1:33:22] so
[1:33:22] let's bring that over now
[1:33:27] and let's bring the new birth into being
[1:33:31] and then we'll face
[1:33:33] romans
[1:33:35] 8 31
[1:33:37] 30.
[1:33:41] those who he justified
[1:33:46] now it doesn't say there to listen
[1:33:50] it doesn't say there those we justified
[1:33:53] he's sanctified knows he's sanctified
[1:33:55] he's already glorified
[1:33:58] because see that's not what you're
[1:33:59] talking about right
[1:34:02] you're talking about the new birth
[1:34:09] paul is not preaching the new birth in
[1:34:10] those verses
[1:34:12] he's preaching to christians that are
[1:34:14] born again
[1:34:16] if the spirit of god be in you
[1:34:19] it will quicken your mortal body right
[1:34:22] how paul
[1:34:25] well
[1:34:26] it's going to come because
[1:34:28] see verse 11
[1:34:30] it's going to come because verse 23
[1:34:33] someone is going to reach the
[1:34:35] understanding
[1:34:37] of how this redemption of the body can
[1:34:39] transpire
[1:34:43] and said it's because
[1:34:45] that we can believe what god says
[1:34:52] all right so it says those who he
[1:34:54] justified
[1:34:56] now we go all the way to the invisible
[1:34:58] union right
[1:35:02] you know people out there might not
[1:35:03] understand this oil back up i heard
[1:35:06] but see invisible union brother branham
[1:35:08] covers justification
[1:35:11] but if you read the book real carefully
[1:35:13] covers it in three stages
[1:35:15] amen
[1:35:17] because you must be justified as
[1:35:19] chopping off your past sin
[1:35:22] and then there is a daily walk in god
[1:35:24] unlike your disciples taught a daily
[1:35:26] sanctification etc
[1:35:27] there is a justification in a walk in
[1:35:30] life
[1:35:32] and then it comes to a time that
[1:35:34] see
[1:35:36] it's real you never done it right
[1:35:40] because the first is chopping off what
[1:35:42] you've done the second is coming to a
[1:35:44] reality listen to the read the book of
[1:35:46] this says dog you've never done it
[1:35:49] you got it it says though you've never
[1:35:51] done it when you say this though you've
[1:35:53] never done it that means you've done it
[1:35:55] right but something has been erased
[1:36:00] amen
[1:36:03] but because of time when you realize as
[1:36:05] john says over in in the little john's
[1:36:08] that
[1:36:09] his seed remain within us and we cannot
[1:36:11] sin that's right
[1:36:18] we cannot disbelieve god's word
[1:36:21] right but as long as we're in these
[1:36:23] mortal bodies
[1:36:25] the prophet said we'll be a sticker
[1:36:27] until we're changed
[1:36:29] now that don't mean well bless god the
[1:36:30] prophet said it so i got to be a sticker
[1:36:33] now that's not what he said you do that
[1:36:35] you prove you're lost right right that
[1:36:37] plain language yes
[1:36:39] i know brother dale's pretty strong
[1:36:40] sometimes when he says thing but i think
[1:36:42] it's time to say it strong
[1:36:44] let's quit propping up hitting the devil
[1:36:48] if you get those ideas in your mind it's
[1:36:50] okay for you to go out and do this out
[1:36:51] the other because you're already saved
[1:36:52] you're lost
[1:36:54] you need a baptism of the holy ghost
[1:36:57] and i agree with one brother said we
[1:36:58] need a baptism in our mind
[1:37:02] and i wish to god he would baptize our
[1:37:04] human minds with the holy spirit to wash
[1:37:07] it and cleanse it
[1:37:08] amen
[1:37:09] but you understand what we're saying
[1:37:13] those who he justified
[1:37:18] not just coming into the body not just
[1:37:20] chopping off your sins
[1:37:23] that's not the the situation that paul
[1:37:25] did he's talking to people that are
[1:37:26] already born again he's gonna explain it
[1:37:28] to us that's right he's uncovered the
[1:37:31] spirit being in us he doesn't cover the
[1:37:33] adoption he doesn't cover the likewise
[1:37:35] the spirit helpeth our infirmity he's
[1:37:37] uncovering the new birth
[1:37:40] and when it comes down to reality he
[1:37:42] says it like this he says
[1:37:43] more with whom he predestinated
[1:37:47] now you know what your prophet said
[1:37:49] about it
[1:37:50] that's why i kept reading that in
[1:37:51] ephesians
[1:37:53] this is the only age that's
[1:37:54] predestinated unto the adoption to bring
[1:37:57] forth the change
[1:37:59] right right
[1:38:01] so then he's talking about those who he
[1:38:03] predestinated
[1:38:07] he's not talking about just
[1:38:09] predestination as a a fact of throwing
[1:38:12] things out and this is where it's going
[1:38:13] to be he's talking about predestinating
[1:38:16] to an age in a time of understanding
[1:38:18] right
[1:38:19] that's right
[1:38:21] and he says
[1:38:23] those who predestinated he called him
[1:38:26] and whom he called he justified
[1:38:32] brought him into the body set him in a
[1:38:33] place
[1:38:34] and those whom he justified
[1:38:37] them he also glorified
[1:38:41] pisces right
[1:38:42] already done your prophet would
[1:38:44] emphasize that i gave you a bunch of
[1:38:46] quotes on the
[1:38:47] notes
[1:38:48] and that
[1:38:49] but what is it
[1:38:52] look at his conclusion then
[1:38:55] what shall we say then to these things
[1:39:02] i've got a lot of uh
[1:39:04] let's see how many have gotten that
[1:39:08] i wish you'd mark them sometime and go
[1:39:10] down through there and look how many
[1:39:11] questions was asked
[1:39:14] verse 31
[1:39:15] ends with a question 32 ends with a
[1:39:18] question
[1:39:20] 34 has a question in it
[1:39:22] 35 ends with a question
[1:39:25] i circled in on little things because
[1:39:27] the question is that
[1:39:33] it means it's asking a simple question
[1:39:36] what shall we say then to these things
[1:39:38] question
[1:39:40] what do we say to this
[1:39:42] if god be for us who can be against us
[1:39:47] what shall we say then to these things
[1:39:49] if god be for us who can be against it
[1:39:52] he that spared not his own son but
[1:39:53] delivered him up for us all
[1:39:56] how shall he not with him also freely
[1:39:58] give us all thanks question
[1:40:03] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:40:05] god's elect question it is god that
[1:40:08] justifies
[1:40:10] who is he that condemneth question it is
[1:40:12] christ that died ye rather that is risen
[1:40:15] again
[1:40:16] who is even at the right hand of god who
[1:40:18] may who also make a conversation for us
[1:40:22] and you're going down through our
[1:40:23] reading
[1:40:25] but listen
[1:40:28] see paul
[1:40:30] is explaining
[1:40:33] in the scriptures now see that's the way
[1:40:35] that i look at scriptures and that's the
[1:40:37] way i read them
[1:40:38] i i read them if paul is saying
[1:40:40] something or somebody's saying something
[1:40:41] about or brother branham
[1:40:44] i like to read where like brother brown
[1:40:47] what is the new birth i like that
[1:40:51] because you you're going to have to take
[1:40:53] what i'm saying if you don't look go
[1:40:55] through the books and read them a lot of
[1:40:56] times people ask brother branham
[1:40:58] questions
[1:40:59] and sometimes it looks like he doesn't
[1:41:02] even get the question
[1:41:06] because he doesn't bluntly answer
[1:41:11] and for some reason i don't know why but
[1:41:13] you you read the book and say you get
[1:41:14] into questions and answers when they'll
[1:41:16] ask him a question about something and
[1:41:18] he seems to make two or three words
[1:41:20] about the answer he goes off to
[1:41:21] something else
[1:41:23] i don't know whether it's the holy
[1:41:24] spirit doing it i don't know but i've
[1:41:25] known that a long time i've always told
[1:41:27] you about it
[1:41:28] but when he says there what christmas
[1:41:30] your god revealed what is the new birth
[1:41:32] then brother brown
[1:41:34] he says the revelation of jesus christ
[1:41:36] personally to you
[1:41:40] he answers the question
[1:41:43] paul
[1:41:45] you said
[1:41:47] that we're waiting to with the
[1:41:48] redemption of the body
[1:41:50] how's that going to be done
[1:41:53] when a revelation comes to you
[1:41:57] that you're standing here
[1:42:02] getting older sicker
[1:42:04] right
[1:42:06] not if we want to it just automatically
[1:42:08] comes with it that's what i tell
[1:42:09] everybody i don't get up every day
[1:42:11] saying well i don't know i'm getting
[1:42:13] older i'm from no i don't do that i just
[1:42:15] get up every day knowing i'm 71.
[1:42:18] and if i get to be 72 i'll have more
[1:42:20] pains
[1:42:22] because that's no normal life right well
[1:42:25] now brother dallas people there to be
[1:42:26] not yeah but they 99.99 don't live that
[1:42:29] long
[1:42:30] so now what's your argument
[1:42:32] right
[1:42:34] but listen
[1:42:36] paul is telling us
[1:42:38] you're going to have to get to
[1:42:40] revelation
[1:42:45] well we'll get rid of will i i want my
[1:42:47] background no no no no
[1:42:49] it's not
[1:42:51] you're gonna have to get to revelation
[1:42:56] you're just as eternal as god is by the
[1:42:58] new birth
[1:43:01] you're going to have to get the
[1:43:02] revelation that you're justified
[1:43:05] in the basis that the real you which is
[1:43:07] the new birth inside of you never did do
[1:43:10] it
[1:43:15] and then you'll realize as we were
[1:43:16] bringing out the other day in the
[1:43:17] messenger that the the prophet said we
[1:43:19] need a revelation where it says that
[1:43:21] we're just as righteous as god he is
[1:43:25] because that's what his mind is
[1:43:28] and then you've got to realize
[1:43:29] realization
[1:43:31] of a revelation
[1:43:33] that we're already glorified
[1:43:39] now that's just an insert
[1:43:42] to try to help you
[1:43:44] maybe a message point to try to help you
[1:43:46] understand the way i look at things
[1:43:49] and the way i study them out to to reach
[1:43:51] a conclusion
[1:43:53] and come to you and try to preach then
[1:43:55] with it with a you know with the point
[1:43:57] of driving it hard
[1:43:59] see we must have a revelation of
[1:44:02] redemption before the redemption can
[1:44:04] transpire
[1:44:06] that's what i said there the other day
[1:44:08] that i thought when i say this point
[1:44:09] that that when god gave you the new
[1:44:12] birth that
[1:44:13] he redeemed your body i thought
[1:44:15] everybody would start screaming glory
[1:44:16] hallelujah
[1:44:18] he said well brother i've heard you say
[1:44:19] that before yeah i said that before
[1:44:20] because i preached something
[1:44:23] but you know sometimes it becomes a
[1:44:24] revelation amen
[1:44:27] maybe it took all the years though my
[1:44:28] understanding
[1:44:32] it's all right
[1:44:35] we'll see a revelation comes
[1:44:38] see when a revelation comes in you don't
[1:44:40] have no problems with the rest of the
[1:44:41] scriptures it'll all fit
[1:44:43] you don't have to deny any parts or run
[1:44:45] anything backwards and
[1:44:47] so when god gave you the new birth right
[1:44:50] there he redeemed that body amen just as
[1:44:52] when he gave the holy ghost came on
[1:44:54] jesus that he didn't need a new birth
[1:44:57] but it came on him as an example or a
[1:44:58] ministry or an anointing but when it did
[1:45:01] it redeemed that body but it was three
[1:45:03] and a half years of horrible life before
[1:45:05] he come to the point of being
[1:45:07] changed amen
[1:45:09] all right
[1:45:11] difficult periods he went through
[1:45:13] amen but yet he came to the point
[1:45:16] so what does it matter if you receive
[1:45:18] the holy ghost when you're eight nine
[1:45:19] ten years old and you're seventy right
[1:45:21] that's right amen
[1:45:24] right there's where god
[1:45:25] claimed that body
[1:45:27] when he gave you the new birth that's
[1:45:29] right
[1:45:30] see
[1:45:32] look what he says let's get one or two
[1:45:34] the quotes and then
[1:45:36] we'll do it
[1:45:40] number one on your notes which is
[1:45:42] actually
[1:45:43] progress 76
[1:45:45] question 107 questions and answers 54
[1:45:48] 54 103 the morning service
[1:45:52] those whom he called he justified those
[1:45:54] whom he justified he glorified
[1:45:56] and ever redeemed person in the world
[1:45:58] this morning that's under the blood of
[1:46:00] jesus christ filled with the holy ghost
[1:46:03] happy everlasting life and can't perish
[1:46:06] and is already in heavenly places with
[1:46:08] jesus with christ jesus and shall never
[1:46:11] come into condemnation already redeemed
[1:46:13] isn't that wonderful see already
[1:46:16] redeemed sitting in heavenly places with
[1:46:18] christ and glory already glorified
[1:46:21] already glorified
[1:46:23] you say brother bill does the scripture
[1:46:25] say that jesus said that or the
[1:46:27] scripture said that are the writers paul
[1:46:29] he said those whom he justified he hath
[1:46:32] already glorified those whom he ordained
[1:46:35] he predestinated those whom he
[1:46:37] predestinated he justified those whom he
[1:46:39] justified he has already glorified what
[1:46:43] is it oh my excuse me already glorified
[1:46:46] then if we are filled with the holy
[1:46:48] ghost
[1:46:49] our fathers and beings had already been
[1:46:52] preserved
[1:46:53] in god
[1:46:55] there is a glorified body already
[1:46:57] waiting
[1:46:58] and you have to go to it as soon as this
[1:47:01] is over those who he justified
[1:47:04] he's already glorified
[1:47:06] preserved in god
[1:47:12] all right
[1:47:14] i gave you a bunch of quotes
[1:47:16] the brother brown said everything you
[1:47:18] need was in you when you received a new
[1:47:19] birth
[1:47:22] all you got to do is keep pushing out
[1:47:23] expectations 1953.
[1:47:26] 507.
[1:47:28] all you got to do is just keep pushing
[1:47:30] now because everything in the journey
[1:47:32] of this whole life is in you
[1:47:34] right
[1:47:35] well i don't need nothing else then i
[1:47:37] just go sit down
[1:47:39] no that wasn't what paul said in romans
[1:47:43] that's not what any christian would say
[1:47:46] the prophet said keep eating pushing out
[1:47:49] everything you have need of is in god
[1:47:52] all right number four you're going down
[1:47:55] you've got to use faith in god which is
[1:47:57] faith 1961 813
[1:48:00] so you've got your own resurrection
[1:48:02] inside of you
[1:48:04] so where's the resurrection inside of
[1:48:06] you
[1:48:07] all right what is the next one
[1:48:10] true easter seal 1961 402 but we were
[1:48:14] resurrected from the inside out
[1:48:16] not from the outside in that's why that
[1:48:19] i don't beat on bodies
[1:48:22] don't beat nobody they're going to
[1:48:23] change the inside
[1:48:25] i try to preach to your soul
[1:48:29] if the soul gets right your body will
[1:48:30] follow it come on i believe that
[1:48:33] we are resurrected from the inside out
[1:48:35] not from the outside in oh do you notice
[1:48:39] not sealed out this way but sealed in
[1:48:44] oh my if the church could just see it
[1:48:47] see we're not sealed out
[1:48:49] we're sealed in
[1:48:51] if the church could just see this thing
[1:48:54] so then i gave you a bunch to worry that
[1:48:56] it covers it like for this is for the
[1:48:58] type of services or anybody else faith
[1:49:00] 1956 we're brought around to talk about
[1:49:02] uh the past tense form of already
[1:49:04] glorified during romans
[1:49:06] past tense four hebrews chapter
[1:49:09] seven part one
[1:49:11] uh jehovah jireh part 61 226
[1:49:16] it's past tense where he said already
[1:49:18] justified he's already glorified all
[1:49:20] that's past tense
[1:49:22] see because it's in god all right
[1:49:26] because it makes sure you're somewhere
[1:49:27] else questions and answers 54 103 the
[1:49:30] evening
[1:49:31] what you are here get this in your mind
[1:49:34] now i'm going to close
[1:49:36] but what you are here is a sign that you
[1:49:38] are something else somewhere
[1:49:43] you've always wanted to be in perfection
[1:49:46] you christians
[1:49:48] there is a perfection and that
[1:49:49] perfection is not in this life
[1:49:52] but every man and woman here that is a
[1:49:54] christian every person that is a
[1:49:56] christian here now is already glorified
[1:49:58] in the presence of jesus christ
[1:50:01] and you've got another body
[1:50:03] you won't have some time some other time
[1:50:05] you have right now right now there's
[1:50:07] another body waiting for you if this one
[1:50:10] should perish
[1:50:11] could you think of that study on that
[1:50:13] just a moment i told you the biggest
[1:50:16] portion of the quotes you'll find
[1:50:17] brother branham is referring to the
[1:50:19] theophany right
[1:50:21] that you have another body right now
[1:50:24] all right we got to get to that so we
[1:50:26] get to it
[1:50:28] it's referring to that because without
[1:50:30] that you cannot get it together right
[1:50:32] all right
[1:50:35] so now what he says
[1:50:37] okay
[1:50:39] let's just quote these couple and then
[1:50:41] we'll get through
[1:50:42] future home 1964 802 number 10 on you
[1:50:44] know he's talking about your soul being
[1:50:46] a part of god your attribute of god etc
[1:50:49] he's talking about that the body's to be
[1:50:50] redeemed the soul's already redeemed uh
[1:50:53] you're displayed here in the body the
[1:50:55] body's to be redeemed now the soul's
[1:50:56] redeemed because it was in sin
[1:50:58] so god came come down by process of
[1:51:01] justification sanctity and baptism of
[1:51:03] the holy ghost and redeem your soul
[1:51:05] and you par you being part of the earth
[1:51:07] it's redeemed by it see the earth and
[1:51:10] time you're in the process now it's
[1:51:12] growing
[1:51:13] on
[1:51:15] right
[1:51:16] seeing any coverage on down to the
[1:51:17] future home that throws part of part of
[1:51:20] it's made his body
[1:51:21] and he come to redeem that and from that
[1:51:23] he'll redeem your body then we've used
[1:51:25] this from before but who is this
[1:51:26] melchizedek 65 221 the evening service
[1:51:30] it's the earnest of the resurrection
[1:51:32] this body will be raised up again
[1:51:34] because it's already started
[1:51:36] it was once now here's where we'll get
[1:51:37] back to a message
[1:51:39] it was once subject to sin and minor and
[1:51:41] corruption but now it's got the earnest
[1:51:43] it's turned heavenly now that's the
[1:51:45] earnest of you that you're going in the
[1:51:48] rapture
[1:51:50] it's the earnest
[1:51:52] all right the others hold on to
[1:51:54] the wednesday
[1:51:55] so they'll be quickening
[1:51:57] the quickening power
[1:51:59] of almighty god
[1:52:01] you see your resurrection is inside of
[1:52:03] you
[1:52:03] your eternal life is inside of you your
[1:52:06] glorification is inside of you
[1:52:08] working outwardly
[1:52:10] into this outward part
[1:52:13] and when we get to revelation inside not
[1:52:16] the brain the head the soul when we get
[1:52:18] to revelation that we
[1:52:20] are just as
[1:52:22] eternal as he is we'll be made eternal
[1:52:24] in flesh
[1:52:26] until that time we remain in fleshly
[1:52:28] forms
[1:52:30] whether it be another 40 years or
[1:52:31] whatever it be
[1:52:33] we remind that until the revelation
[1:52:35] comes but it's already in the bible and
[1:52:38] the prophet's message we're not looking
[1:52:39] for somebody to drop out of space to
[1:52:42] bring us an illegal alien to jump down
[1:52:44] out of space and tell us all about
[1:52:45] eternal life no no i'm not looking for
[1:52:47] something like that it's the message of
[1:52:49] the hour the prophet said our body is
[1:52:52] growing on
[1:52:56] he said it's already started
[1:52:59] he said god lay claim
[1:53:03] amen god laid claim to these bodies the
[1:53:05] day he gave you the new birth
[1:53:07] we just got to let it be transmitted
[1:53:09] from the inside outwardly
[1:53:12] and it's the same thing as your healing
[1:53:14] you get a revelation that you're healed
[1:53:16] it's a revelation it's dark not hope
[1:53:20] it's a revelation
[1:53:21] then once it's made a revelation then
[1:53:23] you must walk on the end of the basis of
[1:53:25] it coming into reality
[1:53:29] all right
[1:53:31] see because hope is not
[1:53:34] faith if you're just hoping
[1:53:38] but why do you hope for what you have
[1:53:40] it's a revelation
[1:53:42] do we have a revelation of the rejection
[1:53:44] of the body come on bro
[1:53:45] see that's right that it's not the body
[1:53:48] that we're i'm not concerned about this
[1:53:50] body being changed
[1:53:52] i must get first the revelation that
[1:53:54] it's changed right
[1:53:56] that's right
[1:53:58] and then when the revelation that has
[1:54:00] changed then it will have to come into
[1:54:02] reality and see you can talk to people
[1:54:04] that have been healed
[1:54:06] see but people have never been healed
[1:54:10] there's a lot of people that's never
[1:54:11] been healed instantly
[1:54:13] so you there's no way you can explain
[1:54:14] healing to them
[1:54:17] it takes god to drop down but it's
[1:54:18] somebody that's been healed i mean being
[1:54:21] healed right there or seen something
[1:54:22] take place right there
[1:54:24] then you can say look this is just more
[1:54:26] of that
[1:54:28] that's right
[1:54:29] the change of these bodies is gonna come
[1:54:31] because somebody gets a revelation right
[1:54:34] what
[1:54:35] not that they're going to be changed
[1:54:40] but they the day god gave them
[1:54:42] eternalizing their soul he laid claim on
[1:54:44] that body to bring that body to the
[1:54:46] place that you're not going to get
[1:54:48] another one right so your redemption
[1:54:49] started right there
[1:54:52] that's right of the body
[1:54:55] just like jesus for three and a half
[1:54:57] years
[1:54:59] what do you think about it
[1:55:01] see that's just the way i just thought
[1:55:03] of sitting there yesterday and i had a
[1:55:05] lot of troubles trying to get together
[1:55:07] how to bring what i want to
[1:55:08] and i thought i'll just do that
[1:55:11] i'll just explain
[1:55:13] the scripture says it
[1:55:16] that paul covering
[1:55:19] right through the scriptures
[1:55:21] and he comes right down to the state of
[1:55:24] showing us that we're glorified
[1:55:27] in the presence of almighty god
[1:55:30] and we must get to revelation that we're
[1:55:32] glorified
[1:55:34] and then we can be glorified right but
[1:55:37] i'll say it again because maybe it'll
[1:55:39] stir your curiosity
[1:55:41] i would look up glory glorified
[1:55:46] translation
[1:55:48] transfigured
[1:55:51] and with those words left
[1:55:54] i don't know whether i'll get to the
[1:55:55] next message or not but
[1:56:00] i just i want you to look up things
[1:56:04] look of everything you can find the
[1:56:05] prophet said about glorification or
[1:56:07] glorified
[1:56:09] studied i thought we were supposed to be
[1:56:10] studying the message
[1:56:12] i thought we believed it was in the
[1:56:13] message
[1:56:15] well then we're reading griers almanac
[1:56:17] or the newspaper to find the message
[1:56:20] now i'll get people to tell you more
[1:56:21] about bruce dominic in the in the
[1:56:23] newspaper they can tell you about
[1:56:24] brothers message why after 40 years
[1:56:28] come on something's wrong with us
[1:56:29] mentality
[1:56:30] i mean that's i'm sorry this thing
[1:56:32] something's wrong
[1:56:34] when people don't know what brother
[1:56:36] brown has talked
[1:56:39] about
[1:56:40] i didn't ask you where's it revealed i
[1:56:42] said do you know what it's taught
[1:56:45] how many times have you ever read a
[1:56:47] message well i read that message i don't
[1:56:49] need to read that anymore i heard that
[1:56:52] i'd advise you to go back and read some
[1:56:55] you look more
[1:56:55] a lot of my books you'll find they're
[1:56:57] marked with red they're marked with
[1:56:59] black they're marked with blue they're
[1:57:00] marked with green they're marked with
[1:57:02] all different kind of colors
[1:57:04] and a lot of that you can't hardly read
[1:57:05] the words because it's many marks but
[1:57:07] that means that's how many different
[1:57:08] times i've read it because i used a
[1:57:10] different colored pencil
[1:57:14] but yet we claim to be going out of here
[1:57:16] and we have the message in our hands
[1:57:19] but we're not
[1:57:21] if we don't get a revelation of the
[1:57:22] change we're going by the grave i've
[1:57:24] told you that over and over
[1:57:26] we're going by the grave we're going to
[1:57:28] have to die
[1:57:30] why because it's going to take a
[1:57:31] revelation to be changed
[1:57:33] it takes a revelation to be healed it
[1:57:35] takes a revelation to be saved
[1:57:38] why wouldn't we tell you that it takes a
[1:57:39] revelation to be changed all right amen
[1:57:42] but do we seek a revelation
[1:57:45] go ahead
[1:57:46] 539 inspire me anybody have a need
[1:57:50] 5 39.
[1:58:06] within me

[1:58:40] holy spirit
