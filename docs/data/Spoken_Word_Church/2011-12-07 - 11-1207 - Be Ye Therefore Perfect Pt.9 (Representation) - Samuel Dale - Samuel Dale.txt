out good all right so just remember those things also we want to thank everybody and we'll do this again Sunday we want to thank everybody that worked in the doings for putting together the swing sets

and the brother that came and worked and and done all of their doings and all we we really appreciate everything that you you've done and all all right I believe that all the announcements the uh Bible study will be the second Saturday of this month which will be what this coming Saturday Okay this coming Saturday or the next which no this this coming Saturday okay we got to get all our dates right that will be the Bible study uh also the communion foot washing will be this coming Sunday because of the time frame and us being gone this past weekend we had a real good time down with brother Collins and he sends his love to everybody and all so we we had a good time there with them on the Saturday night and Sunday morning service and I'm sure you had a good time here you've heard a lot about it but not been able to listen yet so we'll we'll get to it as quick as we can all right Matthew 5 and Hebrews 7 or the any other announcements I generally forget Something Heavenly Father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for the day thank you for the time that we have this night to be able to come together Lord and just to to sit down for a little bit under the shade trees of your gospel and let you speak to our hearts that we may Lord learn from you so we ask you to just guide each and every one of us forgive our sins bless those Lord that are not able to be here tonight and just be with each one forgive all of us of our failures and let your love be with us we ask you to just keep us and guide us in the understanding because that's our desire we desire one thing from you that you open your word that we may walk therein have your way now Lord and we commit it all to you now keep us in Jesus name amen Matthew 5 that we've been reading verse 37- 48 but let your communication be yay yay nay nay for what soever is more than these cometh of evil you have heard that it hath been said and I for an i Toth for a tooth but I say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man will suo thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also now remember the Beatitudes before this and now the Lord Jesus is setting in a in motion or are defining what would be a real true Christian and what he was doing because this is what he done these things and he's setting this down as a motion to the disciples and things to see what it would be when they would come on over into the kingdom all right and see then that would be for you and I also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him Twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away ye have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father see if we walk in this we the children of the father expected to walk in this like this that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sth rain on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans to same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans also publicans so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect now we'll go to Hebrews 7 begin reading CU this is kind of where we left off on our thought if therefore Perfection were by the levitical priesthood or under it the people receive the law what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of mzc and not be called after the order of Aaron for the priesthood being changed there is made a necessity a change also of the law for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar now that's you know that be whole message in itself CU they come out of the tribe of Judah right for it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah of which tribe Moses nothing concerning priesthood and it is yet far more evident or that after the similitude of MDC there ariseth another priest who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life amen you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now remember our thought when we left off was as we've been speaking on be therefore perfect and we I hope that it hasn't been boredom right to you know to you to keep on repeating these things that's right because the one thing that I I believe and we'll get to it after a while if it's not revealed to us then we're just following after the letter of the law that's right and now if you ask people today you know 99.9% of the people of the religious realm if you ask them when did the law end they would say that it ended at Calvary right but remember if we don't have the new birth now I've taught you this ever since the beginning of what I tried to to preach I mean talking about 40 years if we don't have the new birth the law is still in existence amen that's right now you might not like that or whatever but it's still true right and we will be condemned by the law y right because the law was spiritual right amen you remember Paul yes sir he said but I'm carnal so understand he said but see then that spiritual law would be have only the effects of being able to condemn mhm and it couldn't save us cuz there there is no salvation in the law right that's right all right that was the point we were trying to bring when I asked the question uh were the people of the Old Testament made perfect by keeping of the law or were they made perfect by the atonement that they made all right so now I tried to bring that to a conclusion to see that no matter how good you can keep the law it would still not save you right amen all right we're going to get to that on righteousness next and we'll find out a few words on it you know of taking it and going through it but see if we could keep the law perfectly to the letter Paul said he was blindess sureen well why didn't Jesus just drop down on the on that you know there when he was on his Road uh and the pillar of fire came down why didn't he just drop down and say Paul you've been doing great you already Sav I don't need to die for you now you say well we don't think that way brother Dale but listen church if it's not revealed I don't care who you are I am who or anybody is our carnal part of our mind will always try to make some form of a way that we didn't do something or we did do something or this that or the other as trying to be part of our Salvation right that's right and then especially after coming to Salvation we will try to make some form of works as to show you know what we are in in in Saving ourselves well if you don't get anything out of the message tonight you get one thing we'll read it in a minute the prophet said if you could do one thing y to save yourself y Christ died and Bain that's right amen all right now so we better believe in it mhm and accept it right and see For Heaven's Sake don't go into the realm well then if I'm saved by grace it don't make no difference what I do I'm saved now that's disgrace amen you turn the grace of God into lasciviousness to believe Satan's lie right all right but now if the keeping of the law Paul says here in Hebrews if it could have done any good why did they change the priesthood right why didn't Jesus come of the order of error right he came after the order of MDC and there was even no mention of this one it was only speaking law Aaron the priesthood and all the priests only spoke of Jesus Christ right because even Moses never even mentioned him right the scripture said you know as far as a priest the scripture said that he would come out of the tribe of Judah that's right see not after the order of Aon but after the order of Aaron see you went right back under the levitical priesthood the law all right we see if if we look at the law and the keeping of the law as to what has saved us Jesus Christ there was no purpose for him dying right amen so then there had to be another priesthood come and even now watch even as under the law to show that what would be the right one melz came into existence right while the law was in existence right with mankind all right now I know that that was back and I know the Bible of what it was back before so just don't get the wrong idea get what I'm saying now chdc came in a position to were that man was only going to be able to follow the law by the letter and it was added because of the transgressions of man and because we wanted it that's right that's right yep the prophet of God said they didn't get what they thought they got that's right he said they got God in letter form amen that's why Paul would call it spiritual but he said my understanding of the law yep that's is what's killed me that's right our understanding of life is what's killed us amen we teach our children to be good that's wonderful but do we teach them that to be good is going to save them see that's not correct right he said we need to teach them to be good yes right sure but don't teach them that that's going to save them right right the prophet of God said you women don't think because you got long hair and long dresses that that means you're saved that's right am he was blowing about it but you see what I'm trying to do is to break that spell that Satan has over our eyes and the biggest spell he has over our eyes is one thing is the thing that we thought we think that he don't have it over our eyes yeah that's the biggest spell you understand right wording right see the biggest Spell satan can have over our eyes is to tell us there's nothing over our eyes that's right that's right he tells us we're good yeah right well look if You' done like other people God wouldn't have saved you you said well I I never have believed that brother Dale but what do you believe well now what it is is I always was this then now you're going the other way I always was eternal I always was this and seeds and doctrines and ideas and say you can't get it to go in one way you go the other way sure he sees the people getting a little free from the bondage of of legalism that's right yeah bu you know keep of letter and when he does he'll automatically jump right over and start throwing us into a greasy Grace situation you know that's right they don't matter what I do then Jesus died for me it don't matter what I done that's why I spent so much time expressing that under the Old Testament that it was an honest and a contract heart that God forgave that's right that's right everybody that offered a sacrifice wasn't forgiven that's right right now that's the reason I kept bearing on to that point because then coming over where we're at now see we're going to follow one of the the two right that's right yeah it's hard to fall or follow the middle of the of the road right in the natural it's tilted off so Bri's going water's going to run off it's hard on me and you to try to find the middle of the road and walk therein amen amen because our human element will automatically lean back to legalism y I don't do this I don't do that God saved me because I was a good person well if he saves you because he a good person you didn't need saving no right that's why I used a Rich Young Ruler he said he had kept the Commandments true amen right but when he asked the Lord about eternal life because evidently he'd heard this man speaking on something else more than what we've got you know when he asked him he said they said they said I've kept it from my you you know what Jesus loved him because of that you know he's looking at a good righteous man y but he said one one thing like us he knew exactly where his trouble was and see that's what I'm trying to get me and you to look at right said I'm trying to bring this down to a to a conclusion of talking about being perfect then we're going into righteousness and peace and joy and different things you know but I want you to see one thing our carnal mind will lean automatically and we'll try to figure out some way or some reason that God would save us right see then if that don't work as I said Satan will throw us over on the other side and he said well see there then if I'm saved it don't matter what I do right yep ain't no law going to condemn me brother was riding down the road one day listen brother R him on the tape and he began to lay down some things about what was in the man's life you know he took the tape out and throw it in the back seat and his wife said and said he said there ain't no man going to tell me well they just said what most people have in their mind right see then there's a middle of the road to find what it is the middle of the road is the new birth amen right and even with the new birth that's right Satan will try his best to sir take us one way or the other amen right and if I'm wrong you come and correct me now I'm talking about you and me amen me first you second okay that Satan will do everything he can to get us off of that middle of the road that's right but the middle of the road is the New Birth the revealed word how much has your Prophet preached against the things of life right I mean wasn't it the hardest preacher that's ever been on those things right of Life yep and yet seemingly turn around in the same sermon and say what you do and don't do don't have anything to do with it right right why because he's trying to explain a truth the Bible said salvation I believe it's Jonah 2:9 said salvation is of the Lord amen that's right works is supposed to be our faith expressed that's right so then salvation is not what we do or don't do it's based upon whether we can accept what he has done right amen if we can accept what he's done then he can pay the price amen right I thought we believe that he made intercession Upon Our confession right right amen our profession and which way you want to use the word well then he's depending upon us to confess the truth that's right mhm he said You shall know the truth and it'll make you free amen right well see then the new birth don't give you a right to just live like the devil that's right you think it that way you are the devil that's just I don't you know that's where people say brother Dale You Don't Preach against this or you don't preach against that that's the way I preach it don't tell me sisters you're still cutting your hair and tell me you're Sav that's right no you're lost amen you p your face you're lost you see I don't spend weeks preaching sermons then so then people think she just you know just don't make no difference how much stronger can I get it that's right if we live like the devil we are the devil right well just a little bit what did he do that's right that's the way I preach it and I know it's hard see because I'm I'm trying to get you and I to get in that middle of the road amen amen that's right that by the new birth he has saved us and gave us eternal life amen that's right and he made the way to cover amen are the atonement see the difference between the old and the new in the Old Testament they had to make an atonement they had to take an animal they had to do those things but you see we don't have to do anything right all we got to believe is what he done right see we believe what he does he takes care of everything right that's it amen see now there's the middle of the Road and see then if I do do wrong I Repent right right amen cuz if I don't repent I'm going to have to answer for that right how much straighter can anybody preach right if I don't repent of any sin I commit I'm going to have to answer for that one day all right then I have to explain that that doesn't mean I'm lost right but if I keep on going in that line you know and I say well it really don't make no difference he saved me then I prove I'm lost that's right do you understand see we prove whether we're saved or we're lost by the life we live right right you say well what about our trouble Christians have troubles sure Christians have an advocate with the Bible says we have an atonement that was made for us we don't even have to take the animal up and do it right he paid the price right but because you're a Christian doesn't mean that you can live like the devil see we ought to be more conscious conscious that's right you know people on the internet sometime hear my words and Southern I'm sorry but we want to be more concerned about our lives after becoming a Christian than before right amen because the prophet of God said we s a sin as a Christian we will reap a tub full off of it amen well it don't make no difference I'm a Christian I'm going to heaven not with that attitude not with the attitude it don't matter what I do right so I'm more conscious of my life today than I ever have been in my life anywhere right cuz I want it right it's not that I don't want to have to answer there for it but because we have as Christians we have the Judgment of the Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad right not the white Throne judgment that's not a decision of eternal life it's Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad and we're going to have to answer for those times right so that's why marriage and divorce had to be preed right to where it could take care of those situations cuz if not we would have had to answer for that all right but see then that don't make it disgrace nope that's right see if we think that well it doesn't matter what I do I'm saved anyway where's the Bible for that he said look at David how bad he was yeah I'm glad you thought of that one but you better look at David and see what he had too David had and a contrite heart David had a repented attitude about him that's right he was concerned about himself going home from the bed of basba the prophet of God said he done that scripture part where it says return unto me the joy of thy salvation right see I'm trying to get you and I to see what really true Grace is what True Perfection really is remember how we brought it out perfect means that your the Old Testament people were perfect right because when they offered the atonement God couldn't see them right we have an atonement made God can't see us but Perfection has to do with the inward part of God coming down and revealing his word to bring us into those situations that we need to be brought to right reveal word then if we believe and this is the way I do believe it I believe the new birth is the birth of the word amen right I believe it's the word revealed to you that saves you that's right not reading it not how much you can read it but when it's revealed right you think Paul hadn't read it you think he hadn't studied it you think he couldn't have quoted it to you but he said I found that to be death of my understanding then he said it's Christ in you the hope of glory amen he went to Rome to die yeah he wanted to die because of his life that he had lived before becoming a Christian never argued and complained about the daily life of of beat what five times shipwreck two or three times peils of Brethren Perils of this you know what argu about right cuz he was headed Calvary he wanted to give his life for what he done done he knew that wouldn't save him he never thought giving his life would save him right what do you think about Paul you ever thought about him what about a man that would be a Christian come to be a Christian I've heard tals of some of you heard brother R speak of in Pat Tower he was a gangster they said he would drive by a cemetery and say I wonder how many people I put out there you mean to tell me me that you and I can live like the devil and then become a Christian and then not be not ever think about our former life in the basis of sure what we were and how much grace it took of God to save us amen that's right and the concern that we have of what we used to be that we certainly don't want to be that anymore amen Paul said causing people to blashe he was putting a Christian he was resting them but he was putting them to death he said causing them to blaspheme y you think that didn't bother him all of his life am you think he didn't think about all of those people that he made blasphemy and you know what he's meaning by that he's meaning that some of those people recanted their thoughts that's right they took back their confession that they were Christians come on or why would he be saying causing them to blashe right he he caused them to deny the Lord Jesus right why shouldn't you and I be concerned about our lives right amen why why shouldn't we be concerned every moment of the day of how that we live before others and what they see right he said well it ain't my fault well could it be though you remember what your prophet of God said one unconfessed to sin in a church would cause a church to bitterly fail right did you say that amen and he said that and that judgment you'll have to answer for that we don't quote the rest to what he said what about it did I get off my man on but listen there was a necessity that they be another priesthood after the order of mzed right which was was not after a carnal commandment but after the power Paul says of an endless life y that mzd with almighty God Amen according to Hebrews about 7:4 even calls him a man brother Brown said we see no more of mzc he said because he became Jesus Christ amen what about a a priesthood that knew the priest would have to die none none of the others wanted to die right I mean come on we're on his people Aon didn't want to die none of them wanted to die right and they done everything they could dress right to the tea done everything make sure it's right to make sure they didn't die but our savior had to die right half right for you and I amen that we could live a high priest that would have to die how many people want to volunteer for high priest if you know the high priest got to die that's right I mean probably be small priesthood would it right but yet that atonement and listen mzd now listen to what I'm saying mzd coming into existence under the form of the Old Testament could not bring eternal life oh that's right oh he couldn't bring eternal life he was eternal life amen right that's right but he couldn't transmit that no right no way but the only way that we could get eternal life was for mzd yep which is almighty God Amen he had to become human flesh amen yes sir in order to die to make the atonement for us CU see mezic only spoke of the coming Messiah amen that's right M jic only spoke of the coming Messiah that's right he only spoke of the time that he would have to come into flesh y to die amen that we could get eternal life what about it and that true atonement that was made back there was the blood of bulls and goats right M amen right that Jesus Christ couldn't come over and say okay go get me some Lambs right no that wouldn't work right right but see male chesd stepped into human flesh almighty God into human flesh to where that we could have an atonement that would be made to cover us which is the blood of the Lord right all right the blood of the Lord right what about that go ahead brother Anderson pull up number one what about that blood of the lord well brother D was just a man he born a man he died a man he just a man Lord mer what about that blood right whose blood was it what good would it be for for one man to die for another man that's right would that save you so look what your Prophet had to say page 34 Church AG book which is really Revelations the revelation of Jesus Christ Church age book the word was is actually loosed loosed us from our sins in his own blood in his own blood isn't that wonderful but are you spiritual minded did you catch it in other words has it been revealed to you right it was his own blood that loosed us completely from our sins amen it was not human blood it was the blood of God yes sir and watch it Peter called it the blood of Christ Paul called it the blood of the Lord the blood of Jesus he said that's not three person that's just one now it's called the blood of Jesus in Hebrews 10 and 19 the blood of Jesus 1 Peter 1 and 2 1 John 1:17 is called the blood of Jesus now this got these where I could put them in and I didn't ask them to put them on there it's it's called the blood of the Lord in 1 Corinthians 11:27 it's called the blood of Christ Ephesians 2:13 1 Corinthians 1016 1 Peter 1 and 19 Hebrews 9 and 14 it talks of the blood of God amen Revelations 1 and5 Hebrews 13 and 12 yeah Hebrews 9 and10 he calls it Jesus Christ the blood of God Acts 20 and 28 right talks about God's own blood right amen amen so now if the prophet's right and there's not three persons in that quote we were reading there just one person right then it was the blood of God that loosed us amen that's right it was the blood of Jesus it was the blood of Christ it was the blood of the Lord amen so there's no Foundation whatsoever to believe anything other than that that blood was the blood of almighty God Amen that's right oh I am just created you know well it's God's blood that he created amen and see we're loosed by the blood amen but is that being revealed to us she were perfect by the atonement right and the atonement required the blood of God that's right it required the blood of Jesus yep right it required the blood of Christ amen and the blood of the Lord amen so it's now all of that is not the selfs same person then brother randam couldn't have said that that omnipotent right Jehovah God came down in flesh that's right what is our atonement right well we in the New Testament we don't need an atonement we that's what they're saying now no I mean this is 10 15 years ago they saying we was already in the Millennium so it didn't matter how many wives you had how much he done what was wrong didn't make no difference because we under another Covenant now show me that in the Bible the prophet's message that's right if not that's a lie right but you see people don't want you to be set straight but why not amen why can't we be straight right in this day especially you know the prophet of God said the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the most important thing in your life that's right now that quote is just a little different and I hadn't been able to find exactly the wording of it but it's in there I'll just have to keep searching and I'll bring it to you cuz we quote a lot you know sometimes we miss a word and it won't come up with a computer but if you look at the number two quotes you'll see the unchangeable god working in an unexpectable way preach 1962 120 and now you must make that the first thing in your life whether you eat again or whether you drink again or whether you sleep again or whatever you do you must find that that's right that must be the first thing that's it just stay right with God's promise he promised it to you so you just stay right with it see and God will bring it to pass amen what the New Birth the new birth is the most important thing that we could ever think of cuz if we don't have the new birth we can't even start talking about being perfect right cuz you see the atonement of the animal couldn't be brought in no right now the natural Jew is still under the atonement of animals and they're still trying to do those things and sacrifice them and they're waiting on the red heler and the different things but we don't have an atonement that we have to keep making cuz the Bible said he died once amen but if we don't have an atonement where are we right Paul says we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous one who stands in our place where could we ever think as I've read you quotes over and over to think of anything that we you know could stand before God and think that we were in any way righteous right or just or Pure or perfect would it save us if we could find something that we could do what about that's right look at the next one adoption 19 6522 morning service he said I needed saving there was nothing could save me there's nothing I could do about myself I could no more save myself than nothing amen but I needed saving because I believed in God look at and God sent his son made in the likeness of sinful flesh to suffer in my place and I was saved by grace alone was I saved not one thing could I do or you do to save yourself yep and those who he fornew before the foundation of the world thank you Lord amen what about it amen anything you can think of as a reason for God to save you that's right no better believe it's by Grace amen that's right and then just don't run off into disgrace look what he said here you am 1957 3:10 the evening service oh we don't want Justice would you dare to say that you want Justice would you dare to try to go to heaven on your own keeping of the laws and legalistic things you do if that was all right Christ died in vain the law is not a remedy right there amen a law is the magnifying GL to show you sin it's the one who can put you in prison it's the law but it has no redemption in it now listen I made this statement over and over to where people won't misunderstand you there was Redemption under the law right to those who made the atonements and things right but the law had no Redemption the law spoke of a redeemer right but there was no Redemption now there was forgiveness of sins under the law right sure but not by the law right by the law of the scripture said nobody can be saved that's right but what about people that kept it all their lives and that's all they ever believed in and all they ever done and and live and all and thinking that that was what it was see now folks I keep coming back to this because I want this to dwell into your head maybe and maybe it'll someday drop into our soul and be become quickened you said Brother D I don't have anything people talk to me and they say I I don't I don't have anything that I think made me be saved and I'm standing there saying Lord why is this person telling me this cuz see you don't have to tell me that I know you don't have anything right you're telling me that to try to convince me that you do think you have some reason cuz that's human he said no no no no come on why don't you just be honest one time and think see we think that because I don't do something I'm a Christian where's that at where is that supposed to be what is that what mentality what form is it of us that would ever think that as a prophet we just read he said do you want Justice Mercy man I want Justice no no no amen I don't want Justice man I want Grace amen yeah I want forgiveness and see that's why I say that we should be more concerned today about our lives than ever before right but I'm just trying to tell you we as human beings we try in some way one way or the other that we think it was something that we done or didn't do or this that or the other or or something you know to bring us into this message Maybe let me just tell you and I know you ain't going to like it so go ahead you know the only thing that you can call that would help you in any way to cause you to come into this message is because I'm standing here looking at three right now that worked in a automobile Factory and God used that to bring you to the truth right amen you admit it amen that's the only thing you think about see I did you ever think I can't I mean you know I had been I had been introduced to the message and I had done what I wanted to do which would go to General Motors and work a while and build a house and kind of get going with it the little money paid down on it and then quit cuz I never intended to retire and I took a job that I really like which was brid building the man wanted me to be You' heard me tell the story he wanted me to be a construction crew boss you know over a crew he had two Crews at that time he wanted to be the engineer between the two and he wanted me to run one crew and this other man run the other I mean he talked with him that's what he done but you know what there was just something about it I just couldn't take it it wasn't a job I loved it I love construction work I did it wasn't because I saw a guy get his finger cut off right side of when the same saw I just got through using cuz that was this natural things but I just simply asked the Lord a question I said you want me to quit and take this job and I really love it or do you want me to go back to gent Motors and he answered my question I went back to gent Motors you don't want that's where a lot of you others come from there was at one time seven of us what marriage is that you know what we doing we making living you right sure God used us making a living to bring us together for us to hear the gospel to come into this message now what good is the thing you thought you done where's the good thing I would think I done because I wouldn't want to do that right I wanted to leave I loved outside work I was a young guy and I loved it first day I went to work the guy said get that box of bolts and nuts and they weighed about 50 lb and I had to walk a beam out right out to there about 50 60 ft and it was 40 ft straight down and I had to walk out there and help them put that together I wasn't afraid of that I loved it right I used to life at me hang because I was a tall I could hang my L up over the beam and and just drive wedges underneath that they couldn't do I enjoyed it I didn't want to go back to joh M but you know for a living in the mind of the Lord and I didn't know he was going to bring me in contact with other people I was already in the message I already comeing we already had the church here but you see it ain't something good that we've done right it's amazing what he's done amen that's right to bring us to himself amen amen that's right how did you hear of the message that's what that was what I enjoyed I really I just I'd love to go back and listen to that tape again where we had that watch Night Service at time and everybody here gave a testimony amen children and all singing and reading scriptures and giving a testimony and we started at 8:30 got to it I started at 8:00 got to at 1:30 that's right yeah you see I heard your testimonies of how you come to the Lord you know it was God seeking after us amen right amen it's never been that we were seeking after him that's right he said well I quit this and I quit that and I quit the Bible says the goodness of God is what leads us to repentance it ain't what we we are that's right he brought us to himself man it wasn't something we done right sister G I don't mind me saying it she said she come in screaming and kicking she told Brother dick one day said don't tell me no more and I won't be responsible that's pretty good point but you see he saved us amen Lord above ourselves that's right it wasn't how good we was but it wasn't how bad we was right but I do like the last part you know that the the like three pools and things and then the LI was to go out in the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that's right get the bad and everything else then just compel them to come in that's what I consider all of us to be right not how good we are but how much we can depend upon him that's right amen and believe it amen that's on my heart and I'm sorry amen look at the next one Perfection 1957 4:19 if there is anything that I can do to make myself perfect in the presence of God then Christ did not have to die for me if there's one thing that you can do that would Merit anything in the presence of God then Christ died in vain no lawke keeping no legalistic ideas of your own none of your own Holiness Y and listen no things that you could quit doing quit lying quit stealing quit smoking toaca quit going to the picture shows still you're lost nothing can do it joining churches rituals ceremonies baptisms orders of the church reading of Creeds sing of prayers all those things would count nothing you are lost not one thing can you do in yourself for you are a sinner under condemnation and there's not no way within yourself or any Creed or anything that you could do or think of of yourself that would could Merit one thing in the presence of God because you're a sinner to start with yes amen what about it right but you know what you can read all day long if God don't reveal it you know where we're at right where we was we started still got some thought in our mind of some reason my mother was a good person my daddy was this my my uncle was that my you know he was a preacher or something you talk to people and they'll always have some connection mhm and that's wonderful that's life you know and that is like I said I worked at J Motors and introduced him to you to the message I working there I'm glad of that but that didn't save you and it didn't save me no right I Don't Preach because that I'm I'm afraid to being lost you want to quote brother R but you better quote him good on this he said if I sat down go out here and sit down and Don't Preach another sermon he said I'm Sav anyway amen that's right true he said I preach because I love him amen that's right I Don't Preach because of of money don't need it they bother me I preach because I love you amen yes sir I love my family that's right and most of you are my family and you know what I'm talking about that because most of you I spanked you a little bit when you was little remember Joy running around the little skinny things she never has got out of that kids but you know what they're just part of her family man that's right that's right right amen see I preach because I I want you to know what's within my heart amen not because I'm saved it's because I want you saved amen that's right I want to see you in glory that's right doesn't matter if I miss it that don't have nothing to do with it you say oh you're not that way okay that's fine look what he says on the mighty conqueror 1950 8 329 have you my bewildered friends have you never tasted the Lord's goodness to you do you not know that it's nothing you can do in yourself if salvation come by works then Jesus died in vain that's right he died in vain serpent 1958 9:28 brother if there's one thing that I have to do Jesus Christ died in vain Grace I am saved and that by not by myself but by the will of God and by the goodness and mercy right wasn't so from the beginning 1963 306 now some of them say if we keep the Commandments that's all we have to do if keeping Commandments was all that God required Jesus died in vain the Holy Spirit didn't have to come because they had the Commandments before the Holy Spirit came but it takes the Holy Spirit to keep the Commandments right right right you get it you have to have it ins sign 62 1119 if you tried to achieve say brother Brandon now just a moment I keep the Golden Rule now the golden rule is Ten Commandments okay brother if that would have stood Jesus would not have would have not had to die say brother Brown I become a member of a very prominent church that's all right my brother I appreciate that and I appreciate you keeping the Golden Rule I appreciate you keeping the Ten Commandments but if the Golden Rule a church joining or any the any of those things would have saved you Jesus died in vain Jesus himself said himself in St John the third chapter except a man be born again he will in no wise in her hand do you see what I'm talking about he took my place that I can take his place right amen I have a lot more about it but if you don't understand what I'm talking about let me say it one more time if God don't reveal it to us right we are still legalist m and even a born again Christian has to be very careful because we can be very legalistic we look at what people do or don't do well they well I agree we they not and we are not too right but just remember one little thing that's always helped me I always thought we believed in a God that looked down at Mankind and didn't see you know one person doing a whole lot of sin yeah and the other person doing just a little bit of sin and he said I like that fell I thought he saw everybody as Sinners amen that's right condemned that's right and he had to pay the price I thought he looked at all of us as the same that's why brother Dale can look at it like that and not look at something you do or don't do but look at the end of the road I told you and brother dawn again years ago one away I told my wife I said you'll come back I believed it you know what he did that's right but you see you say well there's no hopes for a person that does this or that there's only one sin that there's no hopes for right and that's blaspheming the Holy Ghost and that is to attribute the works of God to the devil is what your Prophet said right marriage and divorce is not Blasphemous right there's no difference in one sin and another sin that's right there's no big sin little sin nothing like that in God he doesn't look at it that way he looks at all of us the same he loved a Rich Young Ruler because he knew he kept the law right yeah but he didn't give him eternal life right there right cuz he's the one that wound up remember over in hell right so he never did receive it right what do you think is the reason that God saved you amen you see I wasn't going this way I was going to go in representation brother Brown said he don't see me he only sees my representation that's right he only sees me through the blood yes thank God for the blood amen amen like some of us were talking the other day about it you know sister said when we leave out of here the blood's gone absolutely because it's going with us only things left is for the Jews and and things you know that'll be under the blood yeah but he only sees our representation that's right now seriously let me ask you a question this a simple simple question and let me make a simple statement do you know that as far as life and doing and our righteousness and our doings we'd have been better off if Jesus Christ had never died now you going to go Haywire there right you're trying to figure out what I'm talking about I'm just telling it like it is if he had never come and died in our place we could have been our good works and our good things and we could have paved the parking lot and put new pews in and painted the church and worked all around right y put Swain sets out in the thing we could we could really just be going good but when he came see that's what I've been reading in Matthew so we'll get out of that and go on Jesus Took the Beatitudes to say blessed are you blessed blessed blessed then he turned around and said now listen and I want you to just think about what I wrote cuz this is what I wrote in my Bible a long time ago and you'll see what I've been driving at you notice I'll stop every once in a while and express something from Matthew now say that what Jesus was laying down what a new thing was going to be it was going to be a new king om it was going to be different thing cuz he already talked about how blessed they were right then he starts telling them said now you heard it said I for n a two for two that was the law yeah that was exactly the letter of the law that's right but he said I say love your enemies he was showing what God would do and I wrote it in my Bible right here God God does it this way God does it this way what he loves his enemy loves his neighbors He blesses them that curses him he does good to them that hates him he prays for them that despitefully use him and he's perfect and he's perfect amen but how do we do if we love our neighbor love our enemy pray for them that despitefully uses that don't mean we're saved right it means we've had a change of heart right we think under the New Testament that that it's that's why everybody thinks that we're in the New Testament why I said that about the law the law still in existence until you're born again because the Bible says Christ is the end of the law for righteousness if Christ is not in our hearts and lives living in a new birth we're still lost amen right and we're still under the condemnation of all right so if we train ourselves to be good you know what good is it right that's a good neighbor I wrote that in my Bible when I started this series to make sure to explain that when it would come time you and I could be all so goody goody and never have a thing wrong and still be lost righten but if we have the new birth we've accepted the atonement and let him pay the price we can be as he said the children of God right we may the children of God and can never be lost right amen right because we have eternal life that's right amen so if the keeping if we're doing what we're doing because of a of a a fact that we've been trained to do that that's not salvation right man but if it's just flowing from our heart that that's what we want right and that's what we are it shows our Salvation that's right our works displays our faith right right you say well you trying no I'm not trying to get us to be good that's what I've told you that people don't understand me when I preach I don't want you to be good right right you said you don't want us to be good no I don't want you be good everybody Mis understand that I want you to be saved if you're saved then it won't be you being good it be Christ in you the hope of glory that's right why did Paul say that I struck it a little bit down at brother col why did Paul say it's Christ in you the hope of glory right we use the word hope is well I hope I'm saved I believe I'm Sav maybe I hope I am was that what Paul was talking about no Paul was saying it's Christ in you the hope of coming to a glorified State that's right the new birth brings a hope this body can be redeemed that's right right but you know what don't automatically do do it right then right takes time right right so Paul's right it's Christ in you the hope Christ comes into our heart it makes a hope Paul had a hope he prophesied or would change the moment twinkle of the night we had to die hoping somebody would catch what he said right but then he didn't die with doubt believing nobody would cuz he knew if there's going to be a change of moment between the life somebody's going to get it so his Hope was not hope somebody gets it his Hope was an anchor of the Soul he said right why can't we find the middle of the road church and quit looking at everybody and condemning everybody because of what they do or don't do if God ever let you do one thing you quit that I stood one day and looked at somebody and I was condemning him to death and all it was it was like a set of monoculars like a single Vision come down and I went right back into my mind and I looked out at that person and I saw what they were wanting to do sure they was doing wrong but I saw on what they were wanting to do don't ask me to explain I can't it's just it's just I was looking like that I just went back and there was just one vision and it just changed my thinking totally about people I don't look down at what you're doing I look at your desire thank you I'm sure we all got sense enough to know if we keep on doing living like the devil we ain't nothing but the devil right but also know that it takes time sometimes right you know what I've always said a lot of people say brother Dale I saw that the first time you said it and I think sure it take me 6 months to explain it to him but see we get to the point when we come in we come we become so righteous we think we see it no right we're still seeing it amen right that's right right yes sir what does it take to be perfect nobody can be perfect I'll agree with you but in God's eyes a prophet of God said it let me say it with him that ever born again believer is perfectly totally sinless before God because they're not trusting in their own merits of any form but they're trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ that's right right is there any hope that's what job said is the whole Lord I would that somebody could come and take God's hands in other words say what like a prophet said about reach up and get God and reach the hand of man and be able to pull them together that's right that's right then one day it struck him and he said I know my redemer living I found somebody that can stand between yep that's right he saw Jesus Christ that would come sure that's why I don't look down on people and I'll just tell you something you'll find out one of these days you're looking down on somebody you better believe there's somebody looking down on you that's right and brother Perry green made this statement so I can state it he said brother randam said brother Perry he said from where I stand to where you're standing he said all you do is sin he said but where I stand where God stands everything I do is sin because that's way we're all think about we're all think about our soul and think about our Salvation right my salvation is dependent upon whether or not Jesus Christ was accepted I've got one in here that says that it's not what whether or not you VI or accepted it's whether or not he was accepted right yeah we said what I got you know it's whether or not he was accepted if he wasn't accepted then there ain't no need of you and I trying to be accepted right amen but we know he was amen yes sir he took my place right therefore I'm accepted in him my whole Perfection lays in Jesus Christ and he's the revealed word has it been revealed to you what it means to be perfect are you still thinking well is none of us perfect well I agree we we all all know that there's don't need to talk about that we all know that you know well there none of us perfect what are you talking about we all know that ain't never been one perfect person that was Jesus Christ but have you accepted the atonement right what about it that's do you believe he paid the price right tell them children that they need Christ in their heart by the new birth right tell them sure we need to live good and act good and be good cuz that's good but don't tell them that or save them that's right tell them they need Jesus Christ into their hearts to save them right amen if Jesus Christ comes into our hearts he'll live in our heart the way he lived in his body but did he go around condemning everybody little woman there you know down in a door adultery he said neither did I condemn them that's right what about it Church let's stand just totally change the message so I just preach whatever he gives me sorry I want to preach on representation but if you don't see that he represented you and I am he took my place that I could take his place let's just be what we're supposed to be try not to be anything great just be what we are that's right Sinners saved by grace like I told was it here or did I tell it down at brother Collins is about the the time that the man up at brother uh bisco's Church drove down the street most of you heard this I saw a lady walking down the street and he knew what she was she was a prostitute the man stopped and roll down the window and said how much for your time she told him he said get in the car he got in the car and pulled over and parked he said lady he said I don't want your body he said I want your soul that's right they' like to scared her to death imagine so he's talked to her about and said God told me to stop and talk to you she had been thinking about God in her life and her ways Y and she accepted Jesus Christ and got away from her life MH how many of us would even think about doing that see when brother Brandon was riding down the road one day and saw this young girl walking down through there cowboy boots on shorts and whatever you know he said I need to stop and talk to her about the Lord he said the voice said you stop and talk to her you'll be in jail one was the Lord being led the other was a prophet telling you exactly right that voice must have been God because he sure listened to it but you see who would ever thought about paying for the time of a prostitute to talk to her about her song bless God I'm too righteous I'm too holy yeah just just remember somebody's looking down on you what about it what do we got from 130 in the spiral book 130 in the spiral book anybody has a need find many people who can understand why we are so heavy and free
