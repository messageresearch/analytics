rain in the time of the light rain amen but it's good to see everybody and also let's just stand and we'll open with prayer and get everything to go and remember I know we all just hold up our hands

come brother Lis I want to say something that I want to you everybody understand he speak better English than me so let's take advantage today everybody happy amen good when o so today I bring something on my heart each one of us come here to a fellowship and the word of God even the prophet of God taught us that in a fellowship each one has to be in one Accord and are we in one Accord because if we're not in one Accord you would not have come today and what I like about it is that there's several pastors here [Music] today and that among the pastors that are here including brother Samuel including each one that's here today none tries to overrule the other that's Fellowship remember that God sent us a prophet to take us out of the nism and in this last day the people have returned to nism there are pastors they want to dominate other pastors there are other pastors that want to take control of others and they see that they say they they see that in Malachi 4:5 but thank God that we have come out of them and we can't go back to nism because you came out keep walking Brethren that's why we do these types of services Fellowship one with another under only one guide and that's that is the holy spirit are we in agreement that's why it's an Fellowship under one guide shom Shalom to each one of you my [Applause] brethen amen is all of the group here for the church just giving a little time make sure they come up or whatever they're supposed to sing for us today so we're supposed to get that out of the way to start we readon that's kind of pulling I know

evening just a little thought I didn't uh I kind of been using this message a different way but I kind of it's a fellowship meeting so I ask God to give me inspiration to bring it to to Fellowship uh a thought to help just a unity and everything like that so that's what we was praying for so as we get ready to turn on read two places in the script I'm going to read Hebrews 10 and verse 25- 26 and also I'm going to read um first John the first chapter verse 5 through 8 but let me begin reading at Hebrews 10 if you put my glasses on then I'll probably be reading from up there I'm going like I can see okay praise God Hebrews the 10th chapter verse 25 it reads like this not forsaking to assim ourself together as the matter of some is but exalting one another so much the more as we see the day approaching for if we sin Wily after we had we after that we have received the knowledge of the truth that remain of no sacrifice for sins I'm going to go to First John first John and I'm going to read verse start reading at verse five down through verse 8 and praise God it says this is the message which we have heard of him declared unto you that God is what and and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie right and do not the truth but if we walk in the light right and he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another yes and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanse us from all sin yes if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourself and the truth is not in us let us prayer our gracious father help me one more time thankes to yeld my body my mind yes my spirit and my soul to you oh Father help me oh God to get myself out of the way now father in the name of Jesus Christ speak to your peoples I give you all my strength for this service in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen God bless you you may be seated one moment I'm going to take my coat off brother Carl says you can't work and fight with a coat on he said when you preaching you're doing both so I'm going to take that off right now thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God this evening I like what they started off in the scripture here as we uh looked at the thought right here we find here that I read in the scripture here that if we should send with the after we have received the knowledge of the truth that remaining no more sacrifice for sin in other words God gift of knowledge is a profit for Edge H so then we find here at the the Bible brings us under Fellowship say if we walk in the light yeah and he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleans us from all sins H that I want to be washed I want to be washed by the word I want to be cleaned by the word HJ so we begin here and I took a thought from there no light no blood Hall if you ain't got no light you ain't got no blood H because the Bible say we walk in the light and he is in the light then we have Fellowship one with another and the blood and the blood of his son Jesus Christ cleans us from all sins so I be to look at I took a thought from here and that way I'm not going to I'm going to kind of a different R I normally take it but we got to first off we got to have light order to be cleansed from our sins how we got to have in the the Book of Genesis one the first thing that God gave his creation was light let there be light how Adam walk in the light Hallelujah Adam you ain't got no sin just keep walking in the light Hallelujah so that would as long as Adam stayed in the light he was C that was nothing that was no Darkness at all and the next thing you know but what God required Adam to walk in the light it was just two things he required he required Adam to walk in the light and eat all he want Hallelujah eat from every tree of the garden but one tree H eat from every tree in the garden here h i just keep eating and just to keep stay in the light and keep eating as long as he stayed in the light and kept eating Hallelujah that was nothing that he was perfectly clean that's all he needed to do God Rec commanded him told him to say to stay in the light long as Adam walked in the light Hallelujah d other word and long as Adam his mate was in the light hallel they were perfectly one with each other Hallelujah other word she did not get a to receive a new name until she uh got out of the L how her name was Adam she was his Revelation how she was the mystery of Adam reveal but when she left the light that when she received the name the mother of e the mother the mother of all living H she received what any what she brought the human R in the power of Darkness but we realize we beginning to here I think about this thing here as I begin to think on the thing so now other words so now when Adam did this he he would to stay with the light Genesis 1:3 he should have stayed in the light Genesis 2 and verse 16 all he had to do is eat H that what all that what the word required her to do and walk in the light and eat the word how walk in the light and eat the word hallu that's what the word this is what this message come for H didn't come here for us to look at it they come here for us to eat it h you don't get fooled by looking at the book you got to eat the book you got to eat the Revelation yes sir we begin to realize here but I want you to notice here so when Adam Veil and he left the light he broke the fellowship with God how do he broke his fellowship with God how do no longer could God how God could walk down and talk with Adam because here he was he was in that great real a light and him and God could come together to light to meet and they could talk personally lift the but when Adam fell and moved from the light other words he didn't he didn't need nothing everything was just perfect everything was eternal Hallelujah here he was everything was in unity right there all fellowship with God and man they can Fellowship together Hallelujah that was nothing bro but when Adam fell no longer do he need no longer get no longer do he need light no do he need to heat what he need to redeem him is blood hallel now once he fa he need blood hallelu know what the only thing can take away your sin is the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah what he did is to restore his Fellowship back God had to now God had to go and get blood he needed blood his way back God just speak now God was not talking like he was God was not speaking lip ear to him no more but God was speaking by the revelation of the blood H without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin I don't care how holy you've been I don't care if you've been raised in the me you got to come through the blood you got to be saved by the [Applause] blood is here now we go here we find here here he was here he was here go here that God go down and he slay a lamb and he clothe Adam with blood howu Adam was clothed with blood huah God see the blood H the Judgment passed over here hallel the Revelation became the blood hallelu now and the word but he had to still eat how you still got to eat you can have the blood but you still got to eat the word how the word is the blood that bleed for you H the prophet of God said any how are we going to stay sinless how can we be such a sinly he's the ever born again person everyone that confess their sin in the blood of Jesus Christ is totally sinless the word bleed for you the word bleed for you church and I begin to look here so so I'm not I ain't got this program I'm just preaching my inspiration so so now we realize here if Adam broke the fellowship and walked out of the light walked from the way that God had written order for God to restore the fellowship back we got to come back to the light we got to come come back to the word to eat it and we got to have blood so God started the plan had God begin to start the way back H so we find here here go Abraham when God left there here go Abraham there God came to Abraham told Abraham to get up from his his kind and and go to a land he ass show him here go Abraham Abraham to walk with the light Hallelujah other words God brought light to Abraham here he was a man that was in a heathen a man that was under Heathen God but when the light came how he expose the power of Darkness it broke the power demon power and Loos Abraham and Abraham begin to walk with God hallelujah then we begin to realize here and we begin to look at the story here just kind of paraphrase it through some many things but here he is Abraham get old didn't have no inheritance right Hallelujah word his body didn't have a anywh he did produce a son Hallelujah he did produce a son called ishma hallelu but Abraham did produce a son called ishma but if we look at the scripture Abraham never had ishmail Abram had ishmail how Abraham received the revelation God never give required Abraham to identify himself with that son right there he said offer your only begotten son Isaac what happened to Israel Israel was his old book your old book when you come to the word of God your old book is done away with God see your new name beginning Hall he saw he saw Abraham he bringing Abraham back in fellowship with him again how bringing AB Abraham back in fellowship with the word again here go Abraham here go Abraham you're going to receive that son Hallelujah here go God appeared to Abraham how he begin to reveal the Revelation to Abraham then God came down in a human body EXA God came down in a human body the light stepped in skin how it goes down to Abraham and he look tell Abraham you going to have a son you going Sarah when it when but the the problem was they were too old to have that son Hallelujah that was too old to have that son Hall the body Abraham body was dead Sarah body was dead how could that dead body have that son that light struck that body how when light said let there be light that same voice say you going to have a son that body had to give away to the power of God Hall then we realize here Abraham in and another way in his old age had this son Hall when signs say it can't happen but when God speak Hallelujah I don't care how long it been laying there if God speak you going to have that son you going to have that son so Abraham produced that son Hallelujah now here go here go Abraham here here go Abraham after he have this son God then God turned around and say Abraham offer this son that was a great test brother homie you talking about a great test that what you I'm talking about God required him to give something up that he done waited all them years to have and now he done got there the p a d body was restored back how W was restored by now God say offer this son it was the hardest test that Abraham ever had how Abraham when a brother died himself didn't let had to kill his own son but Abraham woke up early in the morning before Sarah got out of the bed I say he better done that cuz there been the biggest fight he ever seen you not killing her son that been out of the question Hallelujah let word you know ain't no woman in you do that you might get this Revelation you better not tell her you got this Revelation it going to be a fight there you going to have to kill two people that day here we are but Abraham get up Abraham get up and he started to walk with God hallelujah he started to walk in the light H he was not just walking he walked in the light and that light would lead him to the r where he going to so what did Abraham do he go get a couple of deacons he said come on deacons let's go here all right me and the L going to go young and worship and we going to return how how did he know that he didn't have no feelings he didn't have no sensation that they going to return but by faith that same holy ghost that told him he going to have a child but the same holy ghost on the inside of Abraham speaking the word we we'll go young and worship and we'll return HJ so they we know the story how they begin to go up here on the mountain here in other words they they get near the mountain Mount of Mariah Abraham at the mountain here and here go a a been raised in the message so a looking at his father he got everything but he got something missing the lamb is missing so I better say something here we going to how we going to offer a sacrifice we didn't even bring we didn't even bring a lamb to sacrifice so as said I better remind my father something he getting hey hey father do you realize all right yeah I see your fire I see your altar I see your fire I see the altar I see the wood but where is the sacrifice that was the power where is the sacrifice hallah but we need somebody that had the power of God H in your mouth if you say to this mou and beov not doubt of your heart you can have whatever you say that power is on the inside of you you got to realize speak the word Bri it will take the word to change you what did Abraham say Abraham looked in that Dimension how with under inspiration or Revelation Abraham said God will provide himself saice do you realize what did he do he released the lust the word that was on the inside of him God cl to create a ram that realm had to be created because that Ram was not just an ordinary Ram right it had to type Christ that Ram had to be the very type of St John 3:16 God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son and whosoever believe in him how did that real had to be the type of Christ it was just not any real he spoke a real and that real was not like any other real that's right I said that real was not like any other real it's what made that realm different that what made that Ram different that that realm did not have a father that realm did not have a mother it was created Power that real did not have a father mother that Christ on the earth Christ had legal right to come H the light so I'm not going to take here I'm not going to try to bring all this out today but I want you to notice here God was going to use that way to bring us back in fellowship with him he going to bring his body back in fellowship with him we all going to come to the unity of the faith the unity of the light all Darkness going to have to fade out so light can come in so we begin to realize here I want you to notice this here wonder what Abraham here go Abraham he what what made his body change what changed his body because when when light strike the Earth death was in the earth sir voiding Darkness was in the Earth but when light hit the earth yes sir the darkness the power of death Can't Hold You Down Hallelujah the grave can't hold you down brother sub cannot be held down the light is there it ain't no power to hold this bride down when the light hit the earth that Earth had to give up [Applause] his Hallelujah I'm get look here some you to notice here some you to realize somebody realize here light what we need to get God calling this bride back to light again yes sir Hall wouldn't all Darkness going to fade away how Satan had he done blew his Darkness over the over the over even though the message have been Darkness done but light come H like when brother her said H you know we all you know we word you know the light that he he said got baptized by that was the life for that time H that was the life of that time God seen that H people we not the only one got saved because you he read a message but you got saved because you accepted Jesus Christ and Christ LED you into all the truth oh Hallelujah that's what the message come to do hallel message come to lead you in all truth when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's to lead you in all truth the reason so many different CS are ring the message today because they never got the Holy Ghost all they got was knowledge right tell brother amen man Glory going get but it's the truth in the way but here we are but let me say death I let you know this here when Light Strike death can't hold that's right there's no way for death to hold his grip that's right H how you know here you go here you look at the Tabernacle how here go here go the tab Mo build a tabernacle he took bag of skin Hallelujah he build that Tabernacle under bag of skin word under Earth worldly Earthly bag of SK and then they in that second first Court he had the seven goed Candlestick he had the showbread the all the incent all the things with then that in that in that in that first court but there was another Court back there how called the holy of the Holy Hall you just anybody couldn't go back there the priest could

be a Rapture Church H the bride is going to be part of it hallel give me a few more minutes here I want you realize here we going to we we trying to get back to that Revelation how we need this light here how go what going to change our body how KN that same spirit that was in Christ what was Christ a light how you know he was a light how you know he was a light come on because when Paul met him he was a light hallah Paul here you go that same Spirit how they going to ra that raised Christ from the dead if he dwell in your mortal body he will Quicken your mortal body Paul needed this quickening power Paul was a devil all right he was a man that hated the word to God he hated the book of Acts that's right all he needed was the light H that dead earth right there that Dead stick need a resurrection hallah but the light came oh people you can't stop when God get ready to call a man I don't care how far he I don't care how bad he look but when God get ready to call it ain't nobody can stop that call you don't look for God God look for you you didn't come to God God called you to him you I made up my mind no you didn't make up your mind he made it up before the foundation of the world you just not recognized it but Paul here he here he was he was he come in he was killing the Church of the Living God hallelujah but the light came Hallelujah he was he hated the name of Jesus but the light came Hallelujah that very thing that he was fighting again was the very thing that was going to change his nature Hall that very light that he was figh against was the one that changed his nature Hall here he was he had that old heart a nature of the law in him he didn't give no mercy he was fighting that Church of the Living God because he thought they were blaspheming against Moses law that's right he thought he thought he was doing right that's right he did he was not doing it because he was this he thought he was standing up for the law Hallelujah you know today we think here we Hallelujah in word we just I'm going to stand up H and I want to PR I'm going to prove to the people that brother Bron is the prophet no you need to let the people see that brother Brandon preached Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and Hallelujah this was not about him it was about the almighty God Christ himself came down those SS was not brother Bron those S were himself we respect got Prophet yes sir cuz he the one that remember you couldn't get in the door right without a porter how do you had to have a porter to get into the winded up H our Porter still at the door Hall we had to have on the Garment we had to be dressed right order to get into the wedding supper he preached the Revelation to introduce the bride to her M to reveal [Music] [Applause] word hallelujah but here we are I don't Paul here he thought he was doing right and all of a sudden a light from Heaven shine oh Hallelujah walk in the light and he is in the light a light from Heaven shine H out of that light light it begin to call his name so so what that persecuted that mean he thinking he knew who Jehovah was he knew who the Lord was but he didn't know who Jesus was Hallelujah he couldn't get a new birth without coming to the revelation of Jesus Christ because he was the lamb that was slain he was a sacrifice that was K they had to die for the sins of the world he had to identify himself with blood Hallelujah he said Lord he said Lord he said Paul he said hard for you to kick against the pray he said who are you Lord he said I am Jesus the word Jesus was spoken and Demon power let go because demon had to bow to the name of Jesus Christ they still the same oh hallelujah oh people don't let you know we got a revelation right here the devil hates H but in the name of Jesus every knee had to Bow and every tongue got to confess that he is Lord and he's still Lord oh Hallelujah I want you to notice this real but we need to eat we got Jesus I'm just going close kind of hit this then before we prise you here we are Jesus clo Jesus had to bring that same type that they had in the book of The Book of Exodus they had to have light they had to eat and they had to have blood so here when Jesus come on the scene hallelujah what if he claim himself I am the light of the world I am the light of the world Hallelujah any word he realized I am the light of the world if you in Darkness come to me then not only did he require you the light of the world he said eat me eat my flesh and drink my blood how he was the sa of he made the word and he was the one that shed the blood so he had to bring the same type to bring us back in fellowship with God we needed all three things to happen because we was in bondage H we need the light of the world to come where there no dead care in other words Jesus was such a he was so much charged with the light charged with the light of God he couldn't even go to a funeral service because Darkness and Light can't come together that why he had to let lar die before he show up because he would have come the second day it would have been it would have been over so since the Jews had a tradition they believe that the spirit hanging around three days he said I better wait the fourth day cuz I don't want them to base their Revelation on Traditions had a revelation of the Resurrection is not a truition is a real person so Jesus waited for about we waited for 4 days then he showed up now Elijah's been in the grave that Dead stick was laying ear laying behind the Tabernacle there no life in it at all but when the Chic of Glory come life come back in it so that should count Glory this time walking in SK hallelu walking down there walking down to the walking down to the tomb there here go Mar there it says Lord if you would have been here if you would have been here my brother would not have died Jesus be to talk a little bit and and then Jesus then she said if you would have been here my brother would not di didn't not Jesus said then he turned around he said he arise oh yeah yeah yeah yeah like we always do he arise the G of Resurrection Jes that was an insult he was the G of Resurrection he was the whole revelation of all of it he said no no no don't you insult me woman I am the resurrection I am the life show me where you laid to me she said wait a minute he been dead for 4 days all right now he is sanking by this time so now she trying to put a circumstance why he can't raised he don't care if he was stanking buds C whatever is he was the resurrection so the light go down down now he was a man he had human feeling he get tow up too and get the Weeping that's the man part that was the man part right there Hall he was a man he was weeping as he go down there he get emotionally he was a man but when he stepped down at the T he say roll the tune away roll the stones away H what you had you had two Dimensions to me you had light and darkness come together that was a showdown that was a showdown at the at the death the death is Darkness he looked through the power of Darkness the light was shining Hallelujah other words Satan couldn't hide there death Can't Hold You Down Jesus here he took it broke he he cried with a loud one L when he did the power DED had to release him and he walked out of the Grave oh God when he called we was dead and trespasses his sin but I heard my name under the open word I heard my name oh God praise the Lord thank you Lord that revelation of his word oh God help us all we're going to need this light Jesus was the light of the world and he's still the light of the world a lot of people didn't know who he was they didn't know who he was they did not understand who Jesus was all right amen so brother home it's time for some witnesses all right somebody got to be able to tell the story who I really am so Jesus go to get a couple witness come on Peter come on James come on John they go on the mountain going to show you who I am all right hall I'm going to show you who I am so you get them guys up on on the mountain there Hallelujah that same power that same light that he was talking about he was now he going to show you what was really on the inside of him H he going to make his he going to yield his body and his body going to right there where they looking at it going to transform itself right into another into the power of light and the Bible say here and he yeld he let he didn't have to die by the way he didn't have to die he died for your sins your sins are what he was dying for he didn't have no sins he didn't have to die Hallelujah his blood was eternal hallu his blood didn't have no it word Jesus blood was eternal he should have LED out before he got to Calvary right now but they couldn't kill him that's right because the power that was on the inside of him was the life of God so he walks up there and he stood there in front of them as he was standing on Mount Transfiguration all he had to do is yield himself and when he yielded himself his body right then begin to change and it was glorified right in their sight hall right there they stand and he released the power there I want you to let you understand something everything that had death and he had to change His Garment had to change because it come from some dead animal it came alive it was shining like the rest of it oh hallelujah oh people I want let you know when the resurrection power come every part going to [Applause] change when he did that he broke the dimension he broke the power of Darkness Moses walked out the dead in Christ Rose the dead Christ had to come out Hallelujah he come out to stand beside Jesus on M TR regation under that great light H Elijah never died the alive and remain they both come out and they stood on the mountain under that glorified God here they were that living and the dead show you he people when he come again in his glorified body and stand on that cloud the dead of Christ will rise oh you ain't GNA be stopped this there there Dev you won't be able to stop the power is in the bride hallelujah hallelujah the Resurrection The Resurrection let me just use this one here he the blood and we needed the blood yeah what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus you said brother I believe the message but you still got to come to the blood yes sir reading a message book don't save you but mean the author of the book is what save we got lot of intellectual knowledge you read M book we brother hom know he done been around for you he done seen the guys quote here and run off with another man wife how they can quote this thing they can do it but they can't live the book because the life is in the blood without blood you can't live [Applause] it so we need Jesus here at the end of day he had to released his blood so he goes to Calvary that's where it all starts at I don't care where you go you got to come back to the blood Hallelujah the only way you can be released from sin you got to come through the blood so Jesus goes to Calvary there and he goes there and he's standing he's hanging on the cross H that body bleeding and and beating and toring to Pieces H that body there he was going through all kind of agon and pain it was going through stress it was going through everything that you don't went through right now yes sir amen it went through everything right it was so deformed that God closed the heavens couldn't look at his own son he stood there as a man but on the inside of him was the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah he stood there and as he was standing there they took two low down theves yes sir to humiliated him the humiliated him yeah he was them two theves on the cross ain't done nothing but a thief is a thief people I know well I tell you what I tell you I used to go in place with my cousins and them guy was so good man you walk out of the store you said did y'all get something they have a whole lot of stuff I said man I didn't see you get that they said well that was a thief you don't F to see it I said them J was like Med but here we are that's the thing and they holding Jesus beside two peoples was not worth nothing I'm sure where the bloody that's where we stood without Christ we was no different from them two theves without the blood shed it we was no different from we were always by by Nature we were children the Wrath walking out the power of our own imagination but God who is rich in Mercy he stood down on the cross between two thiefs and blood running down blood just dripping down his body and all of a sudden Jesus is dying he's he's about ready to yield himself they couldn't take his life they never took his life he already declared no man take my life I'll raise it I lay it down and I raise it up ain't nobody ever made that nobody never said that before that can make it happen that's right but Jesus knew it was because he knew who he was he knew I am the resurrection how so he and where he's standing and he's bleeding and he's and he and he and he's gasping all he got to do is say Lord I commit my spirit in your hand his Spirit would have left his body that's the only way it could happen and Jesus don't and now the two thev is on the cross there's a conflict start right broke a fellowship that one Thief turned around and looked over there he say if you be God come off the cross and save yourself and save us that's right if he would have come off the cross we all would have went to hell because only thing that could take away our sin stain was the blood Hallelujah Jesus had to stay on the cross and this other th says to him man you don't fear God wait a minute what did it matter if he fear him or not y'all two getting ready to go to hell the devil wouldn't even worry about them H the devil probably told us demons y'all concentrate on Jesus how don't worry about them to their minds Hall their mind and know no doubt they thought he probably here you know he knew he had them they were th he knew in a few minutes they'll be coming in the hell way I w't let you know something here but they didn't know what God had in his mind they didn't know the mind of God so this thief as they talking the thief look at Jesus Oh My and he says these words he didn't do nothing he wouldn't going to church he didn't pay ties if he did he stole it in other words [Laughter] in I mean so you know he wasn't doing nothing religious for God at all neither would you before you met God we were cuss and we might not sto we cuss and did everything there committed all kind of unclean act and everything we needed the blood of Jesus Christ you said but I was in church how you might have been in church but that don't mean you were saved we got a lot of demons that go to church they never get the Holy Ghost you just going to church one thing bring your body to church another thing to bring your heart to church this is it so he's standing there so this th he begin to recognize I need Jesus wonder what made that Thief recognized he need Jesus he was a thief he was going to hell but he recognized I need Jesus amen I recognized my atonement I hadn't done nothing to deserve this and all he said father when you come into your kingdom would you remember me remember mean to bring back something in your mind that's right how you bring back something in your mind before the in word the devil thought he had him but he didn't know that Jesus was going to go through his photo alen hallu didn't know the J go over this photo Heaven before the foundation of the world I I got my sheat I hear my voice and I would not loseing one of them the devil going to lose something he thought he had it was no accident sir that young man was an ordained of God to come up in Matthew 27 and the devil could stop that Resurrection so Jesus said there he around he say Remember Me Lord when you come into your kingdom yes sir Jesus turned around look through as the blood scream through his eyes and the blood going through his bride and everything Jesus looking through his own blood and when he looked at his own blood he saw him white as snow and when he saw white as snow he said this day you will be with me in Paradise this day that said the Lord It Ain't No Grave it ain't no power to hold that down this Resurrection Is that real Church and if you don't know him after the power of that Resurrection you need to get to know Jesus musicians come back I'm going to thankes Hall this Resurrection is real church this is not just something to play with Jesus died to
