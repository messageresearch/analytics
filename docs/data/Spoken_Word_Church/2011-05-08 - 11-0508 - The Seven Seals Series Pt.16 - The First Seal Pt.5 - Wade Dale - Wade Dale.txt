TRANSCRIPT
========================================
listen let me tell you one thing for sure and let me be as honest as I can be and as truthful as I can be these seals have an underlying meaning that no one can tell you right a minister can get up and preach for years but unless you catch what God's saying that in between the lines because we can read what the seal is it's a white horse riter then brother Brown said well it was the Antichrist you said well that was good that was something that was revealed but that's not all of the first seal my that just when that open like I said Wednesday night when that first seal opened that opened the whole you know like a blood gate doesn't close anymore but it doesn't just say okay we found out that this was a black ink pin that's what people do with the seals well that why horse rider was an antichrist and then they go to the next one no you got that thing still fold I'll get it though that thing folds and unfolds and folds and unfolds and keeps unfolding every understand that I mean really I want people to start seeing that when we leave the first seal that it it's just I don't say just it's it's the greatest thing that ever happened to man when those seals were open it brought God to the people so real supposedly supposedly it brought God to the people so real but the prophet said those people were not getting it so it wasn't to that group of people they were all going to die and all going to go by the grave but there's a group of people in the end time that's going to take that and let it unfold something straight from God CU brother R got this straight from God you said well the angel brought yeah the angel was you know he was from God I mean so it was God so when we go through these seals just remember there's there's there's it's a building on top of same way with the with the Statue of perfect man when you get finished when you get born again do you forget Faith No nope it's big do you forget virtue no these are just lines to indicate a step okay these are not lines to say well all right I got faith virtue you understand what I'm saying you keep Faith all the way through you keep virtue all the way through you keep knowledge all the way through add two so you don't you don't build the first you don't build the first rung of a step and then when you get the second one built you kick the first one out no it's that's the foundation actually that's the important one right 200 steps on top of it and you kick that first one out guess what's going to happen that whole staircase is going to do this okay so we got to make that Foundation that's why I was going I was trying to U show you Wednesday night on that first seal there's more to that you brother R said one one seal he said you can preach forever for an eternity on just one seal all right but let's read it and let's get started probably going to do a little recapping from Wednesday night but that's okay and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard it were the noise of Thunder one of the four Beast saying come and see remember we said that with the lion l i o n That Lion Spirit lion not lying the lying one is the one that's telling you that this is not true and I saw and behold a White Horse He that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer now let's go to Matthew 24 told you to put a mark in there and I didn't even do it myself put a little Mark there in Matthew 24 or bookmark we swap back and forth there it is for many shall come verse five for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many now let's go to Second Thessalonians verse two everybody guys say Amen second Thessalonians 2 where we read last uh Wednesday night excuse me amen don't get many amens am amen amen oh me okay let's start with verse three let no man no verse two talking about the day of Christ is at hand all right we read that Wednesday night let no man deceive you by any means now what did Jesus say in Matthew h what did Jesus say in Matthew watch out for false Christ what people people men lying people like we talking about last night lying preachers deceiving many let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come what the day of Christ except there come a falling away first and and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition I told you I wrote in my Bible by this message there's only one way that that man of sin now down Through the Ages Born Again Holy Ghost filled men have warned us against the spirit of antichrist or the spirit of wrongdoing or the spirit Martin Luther Wesley Columba all those they were warning the people and they turned away from that but in the end time we see this is culminating in a man amen the man of sin all right now with the man of sin let's just read verse four who opposes and exalted himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God as as God sth in the temple of God showing himself that he is god wow that's close not to be like God but he's even saying something that you and I are supposed to be saying by Revelation that we're God made manifest in another form he's saying he is God the very one like I said Wednesday night the Bible says the Holy One of Israel there's only one Holy One one right not two he wasn't holy three he was the Holy One all right the Holy One of Israel but when you have brother brand when he saw that that true one true Living God and then he saw another person trying to imitate that he knew one of those two people had to be wrong and that's what you and I have got to like we were talking about the Bible Study last night you and I have got to discern the two spirits that brother Brown said work in the framework of this church this Tabernacle this Temple right here that's right okay I'm not worried about this building it's this Tabernacle that we got to worry about right here so when brother randam saw when he saw that white horse rider riding away he said You know here stands a lamb with a book in his hand who's the lamb Lamb's the Lord Jesus Christ the son of man right God made flesh with a book in his hand which one the book of our names right the title deed to our Redemption and then there went something away from him well you know I would be smart enough to know that if it was two people and we were talking about God one of them had to be the devil but see he Bluff himself so long showing himself that he is God even in the end time he's not sitting out there in the in the Catholic Church he's already got them right right cuz you got to remember one thing it's hard to say anybody that takes the father son Holy Ghost baptism in this end time I'm talking about now now don't tell I'm not talking about somebody that was born in another age or or somebody that was U uh even in the even during brother bram's time cuz there was a lot of people that were born again in brother bram's time that couldn't see the water baptism and Lord Jesus Christ brother Bosworth people like that he said great man of Faith but couldn't see father son Holy Ghost B I mean couldn't see the one true Living God baptism but in the end time God wined everybody's ignorance until this book became open in 1963 that's why people have a real big problem with saying brother R's Ministry changed in 1963 the only thing that changed in 1963 was a dispensation it was a dispensational change that the son of man like brother Claud was preaching remember the son of man literally the son of man the spirit of God in human being come down through brother brandom and spoke to a group of people spoke to a group that's one that's one that that they always thought they thought brother brandom was God because he spoke so close like Jesus Christ but he was speaking to a future group we read it Wednesday night remember he said it's gone from you it's not for you you're not even going to get it but it'll come in a later time in other words which is th believe this end time so now that dispensation and we proved it there with Daniel 70 weeks when we did that Series in 1977 truly brother brandham said it would be the catching away of the Gentile bride and the Christ return to the Jews well in 1977 there was a change all right in 1963 the seals open God opened the seals but you got to remember remember what we talked about in the church ages the church ages are not like this to really draw that right this is your church ages you go everybody understand that cuz there's an overlap right God just don't do something and shut it off he told him he said you're going to go out in 400 years he gave him 430 years you know what this is called right here Grace yes you know what that 30 years was he give to them Grace so guess what he gave us all Grace but now in 1977 I believe God did start opening the word to a group of people now father son Holy Ghost baptism you're not a bride you're not bride I'm sorry cuz there somewhere God wines your ignorance but there somewhere God said hey the word's been open now the word's been got out the word is on the front page brother BR said this is not done in a corner this is for the whole world so God said all right father son Holy Ghost baptism Antichrist that's what brother Ram said he said father son Holy Ghost baptism come from from the pits of hell so guess what if you're baptized now in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost you're not born again all right you just not born again sorry so see that so Satan's already Satan's what my point whole point is Satan's already got those people sure they may be given eternal life right that's why I was telling you a long time ago the foolish virgins in Matthew 25 that's going to be a lot of people sitting message church and their Pastor not born again and they're not born again and they are being stopped and that's the foolish virgin because a virgin is somebody that's never had a man right so a foolish virgin was just they were virgins they were just foolish right they were just blinded by false Shepherds and there'll be a lot of foolish burdens come out of this message cuz they're virgins they had to know something right m not be sitting in somewhere with your hair all bobbed off you look like a clown and you wear pants at church that's that's that's Satan's seat this is where Satan wants to be right here if he's got them he's focusing on a group right here right cuz he's trying to get us and he won't because we see the book right so in the first seal what the things we see number one that the man of sin is going to be revealed in the end time to a group of people now I don't like let me put this way I don't like the word revealing Satan cuz there's nothing really to reveal but if you reveal God you expose Satan okay and that's what's happening every Wednesday every Sunday every time we do Sunday school class somewhere I'm hoping somewhere even in myself that that God's word is exposing some little something that we do that Satan's got one little bitty grip on it it's got a little fingernail stuck in us somewhere and we can get that fingernail out of us one little grip cuz see he still got dibs on that body that's right he's a squatter he don't have a title to it right but if we accept Satan's Li then then this thing is still in his Pawn it's in the pawn shop his pawn shop it's not in God's pawn shop God trying to get us out of that pawn shop M right okay so man of sin come to the Forefront being exposed then you've got Jesus Christ opening a word to a group of people that's never been opened like this before oh sure people looked at it Paul looked at it everyone but they never they com I want you to think about this even right here second Thessalonians he was preaching to the people of thessalonia correct well all these places was where he went Corinthians was in Corinth Fon all these were places establishments all right uh cities that Paul would go in and he would preach see what they were doing and he would write them a letter hey you're doing you know so well that's what the Bible is he was looking at Ordinary People but he said I look through a glass Darkly he he preached this um right here read verse 5 remember you not remember you not that when I was yet with you I told you these things in other words I'm reminding you of what I've told you and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time now to me that's a prophecy because those people didn't know the man of sin wasn't revealed in that time he was still doing his work Antichrist the word Antichrist was not even during the here in ad 54 the only time Antichrist came in was when John came back from patmas and God had to show him the Antichrist John comes back from patmas goes first second third John and calls it the Antichrist we read it Wednesday night so now we know it has a name it has something that we can relate to and in that first seal though the greatest thing we need to look at is is that God is not fooling around anymore and it's not not God fooling around we need to quit fooling around God's ready to get a people ready all right let me take that back God's not he's never fooled around that's right but God's tired of us fooling around right okay and um you say God's tired of things well what did we talk about last night six things God hates you say God can't hate the Bible say the six things God hates right okay so I'm not reading you read the Bible read it over there in Zechariah Ze right Proverbs no proverb yeah Proverbs 16 16 God hates so God to me God is God's trying to show us that he's a lot more human than we think he is and that's just from what I get from reading the Bible because he's got he's got he's a person God's a person what do you think we if we're born In His Image what do you we think where do you think we get all the attributes from we don't get them from the devil right as had SE taste feel smelling here memory reason conscious effects imagination now this one wasn't messed up cuz he had no memory of sin until the fall came then he remembered what happened back in the garden and then imagination and all that I I believe Adam sat down and brother Brown said if he didn't like this tree he'd ask it to move right well don't you think that was in his imagination he'd rather have that tree over on this side than he would on this side I don't think we're going to when we go to heaven we're going to just be sitting around a bunch of zombies we're going to be it's going to be probably 10 million times more in our senses than we are now but they're going to be for the good if you tell you somebody you going to be there in a second you'll be there in a second CU you travel like a b but all this that's what I mean all this is going to go away and that's with this seal opening the first seal opening it's showing that this man of sin is here he's working in unrighteousness remember we read on down a little bit further let's read verse 7 for the mystery of iniquity does already work right only he God who now leth will let in other words he's letting this thing go on excuse me until he who he said bride Christ the bride be taken out of the way and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth which is you and I Spirit of his mouth final voice the final Ag and shall destroy Joy with the brightness of his coming see now that's an overlap right there's an overlap I didn't get into that Wednesday night but there's an overlap for the mystery of iniquity that already were until he who now let will let until he be taken out of the way in other words you think in your mind you think okay the Rapture is taking place then the wicked one to be revealed that's true but the only reason he's going to be revealed and the only reason we going to go up is he that he has been made known to be who he is because he's going to be destroyed what's the last thing that Satan has on you and I there's only one thing yes death one thing you say no he gives me cancer if you take cancer long enough guess what going to take you to death right so there's only one thing that Satan has a hold on I'm talking about the Bride of Jesus Christ the only thing he has a hold on us is death that's it and once death is destroyed that Wicked one will be I hate to say revealed I just don't like the word because you don't can't reveal something that's that's that bad exposed but exposed is good for me he'll be so exposed that remember when we go up Satan comes down he can't stand to be where we're at right when we go to heaven he'll come right down here and actually incarnate a human being right because what God had already come down and incarnated a human being right right okay so now and shall that Wicked one be revealed here's your overlap whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth which you and I are the final voice to the final age so it'll be us because remember when we go into the Rapture there's nothing else to fight Satan with when we go up we're going to get in the four seal when when those when those four combat beasts go up and come off of this Earth brother Jim Pinkston read it and it's a quote that's kind of It kind of bothers me a little bit but maybe God will reveal it to me but brother rown said that the Holy Ghost will be withdrawn from the earth right around the time of the going up I got the Holy Ghost I mean I you know you could say that maybe that was an the anointing on the people but you got to remember remember one thing when we leave this earth there is no more God on this Earth I want anybody to think of that there's no more Holy Ghost right because what is he here for sure those foolish virgins who get an anointing they go so far they get Justified they get Sanctified but they never get filled with the Holy Ghost the only Holy Ghost that's going to be here during a short period of time is the 144,000 that raise up during the time of that 3 and 1/2 years that's going to receive the Holy Ghost right that's the only thing other than that God Almighty the people of the earth that God has always wanted the bride is not going to be anywhere on the face of the Earth that's right and brother R said God is going to be where his wife is so he won't even be on this Earth so you're talking about that's why he said he who let it will let other words God let this thing go on he look how evil it is out there but he's not touching us he's not touching the real bride you say oh the bride looks awful then they're not bride the bride's doing things they shouldn't do I agree with that but when these people go out and do what they're doing now I don't think that bride start with all right going out and living with other women and doing all kind of stuff like that in the message I just don't see where that's part of Purity that we're supposed to be a part of now right okay so he'll be destroyed by the brightness of his coming well there's only one coming that you and I need to worry about and that's the bride coming of Christ when he comes and gets us he's not coming back in a physical body remember on this Earth until the Millennium so he's coming in spirit form to pick us up because it's going to be the secret catch catching away you know when when when Jesus splits the Eastern skies and comes walking down you better believe one thing for sure if you're still here on Earth you miss the Rapture cuz we get the secret carrying away we get the secret going all right see what I mean you take this first seal and you just keep talking about one God we just talked about water baptism all the things that you can just sit here in the first then they said oh no the first seal was the the white horse rider with the Antichrist well that's okay to you know to peel the piece of it off but I believe the seals was it's just like this Bible this Bible brother BR said this was what was sealed with seven sealed right look how many pages there are where's the first seal start and the second seal end this is an eternal book that's right that's right this book may have uh several thousand pages in it but one day this book is going to go away in this form right and it's going to be a living form that's what God always wanted a living form but this Bible right here is going to be made be made known in a group of people we're not going to have our Bibles wrapped around us going inure no we're going to be the Bible right we're going to be the culmination of everything in here that's why everybody wanted to see our day all the Old Testament Saints they saw a group of people that made it and they tried to attain to that and couldn't even Paul I see through a glass Darkly you know you get an old foggy glass you can see an image but you really can't see well see when those seals opened up that brought 2020 million 2020 million Vision because where did it say eternity remember the line is down here the YX the man our sight's limited but you take that eagle and you send him up about 20,000 ft he can see in every direction unlimited and as far as he flies he just keeps seeing as far as he flies he just keeps seeing man you and I can go stand on a mountain we can only see to the next Mountain if that mountain peaks higher we only see so that limited but you we're in the eagle age now where we get that eagle anointing and that takes us up above far above all things all right so what I'm saying is let's do like Paul not get away from water baptism and all those things that we should already have that settled in our heart right all right I said before when we started this um series if you're not born again you need to get born again or you going to be behind you're going to be behind cuz you're not going to you're going to think okay I understand words words are okay and God can Quicken those words but one day you got to be born again and let that God speak to you I talked to you for 20 years that's right but if God will ever speak to you one time I don't have to worry about it anymore okay so that's the same way with this first seal very humble but very profound when this seal open brother brandom was standing in awe I believe of what went on listen to this verse eight and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth final voice of the final age the only way Satan's going to be exposed is you and I are going to expose him because we're going to preach a gospel Y and you're going to hear a word and you're going to be able to prophesy and you're going to be able to speak all right now and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming remember we read Wednesday about the moon the moon's going to seven times brighter as bright as the sun seven times brighter of his coming even him Who coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and light and wonders that's why it's going to be so deceiving see Satan you know in those ages you could see people like hus and philus and all those people so Paul could see that Satan was trying to get in through his craft you know craftiness preaching but it kind of went away in the Dark Ages you saw a cruel group of people Satan really used that Roman Catholic Church to kill 68 million Protestants you could see the difference and even in Luther you could see the difference Wesley you could see the difference and even in Pentecost you could see the difference but now now Satan has worked his way back into the temple y he's worked his way right back in now so they they're so close now that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible that's right all right so that's what we're looking at here even who even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all lying power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivable deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they love not because they receive not the love of the truth not loving your wife not loving your fellow man just to love your fellow man but to love of God God and the love of God is what the new birth people I have talked to people for an extended period of time cuz brother R says when he went across a curtain of time you know remember the angel said all that's here is perfect love everybody they have spent their whole entire time in this message trying to figure out what perfect love is what was one thing though all those people had in common over there it was there was only one thing in that sixth Dimension they had in common every one of them had the same same thing some were blackheaded some were brown headed some were blonde headed some were short some were tall brother described them all men and women but there was one thing that every person in that Dimension had they had the Holy Ghost they had the new birth that is perfect love that's right that is perfect love see so you can run yourself crazy brother ra oh you got to have perfect love to be there oky dokie you got to have the new birth and every you know of course I was talking to this man and he would think that brother brandham had to come back because nobody had perfect love in the message really to get down to the bottom line is nobody liked him because of his Doctrine so they wouldn't let him preach so he thought everybody was against him so anyway but you always have an underlying meaning to these things when you talk preachers especially but he's like brother R has to come back and give us perfect love because we can't get it oursel I said well then you you don't have the new birth in oh yeah I'm born again and I went through the whole thing and he said well that's your interpretation of it I said well and one thing for sure brother R the angel told him all that comes here has perfect love and perfect love is what gets you here and that was the sixth Dimension where all the born- again Believers were so there's only one thing they all had in common they had perfect love and brother brandom wouldn't have went there if he hadn't had it right so if he had it and he's got the same Holy Ghost you do and I do apart from the gift apart from the gift there's no little Holy Ghost and big Holy Ghost right apart from the gift the man had we got the same New Birth that brother R had so there's your perfect life amen and I know we got to work on this guy out here okay but remember what Jesus told the disciples he said in other words he said if you can love your enemies the same as you love yourself right and mean it right he said then you're close to the kingdom and remember brother brandham remember Billy Paul said that was one thing you couldn't tell from Brother brand you couldn't tell what who his enemies were or who his companions or Chums were he said because he loved him everyone he had that love that you and I need to have right we got to remember the ages they did not have have this body redeemed exactly and that's why they could have perfect love and that's why this body's got to get under suje because we're going out of here and not any ages ever went out never had to have that that's why the Cs had to come right redeem the body yeah you got to go back to the underlying meaning of this whole thing so you just you say underlying meaning I've said that about five times well it's just it's just a little it's like these little Pages you know you you read one and then you peel this back and there's some more you peel this back there's some more cuz the books got to be made known the lamb had the book in his hand what was the book brother R said the book of Nam the right so the book of names in here we go to Second Thessalonians you turn the book and it's a real even a thin very thin page but still there's more to be revealed on this page all right and when that first seal brother around rolled those Scrolls up when you roll them up when you break up first seal that opens it then you take two three four you don't close it back up everybody understand that you roll it up there's seal on it you got your other ones in here but you got a seal on it right here once you break that first seal then guess what two three four that's why the first seal is very important the most important seal if God hadn't broke that seal to that Prophet then none of them would ever broke cuz man had an idea about what was going what was going on all down Through the Ages but God had to start a a little Kian I lost my place and uh let him subject himself to the will of God cuz brother B said himself he said I don't know what that first seal is I don't know what the second seal is I don't know what he definitely didn't know what they were after that angel came and said um white horse rider is not the Holy Ghost okay it's the Antichrist let's finish reading this before we get even him who's comeing is after the working of Satan with all power line wonders and with all deceivable deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth they didn't say they not didn't receive the truth see if foolish virgin will receive the truth y but they're not born again say w receive the love of the truth right A lot of them because they're pastors you know brother Brown made that statement he said you can't go any higher than your pastor if your pastor's not born again you can't get born again that's right unless you go somewhere else unless God calls you to go somewhere else and then you can go higher Amen to that that means you're predestinated seed you're going you going to make it but there's a lot of people Sting the message churches I've seen them and you've seen them that just are miserable miserable and because of one thing youall know what it is they're head because they receed not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause God shall send them so it's not just one or two it's them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness now next week yeah we'll be here next week next week um we're going to bring your steal book all right cuz we're going to read what the prophet said in the first seal we're going to read some things in it we won't read any Scripture next Sunday unless the Lord willing that we do but we'll stay in the seal book so bring your seal book and we'll read what the prophet said because there's some keys in there on the first seal that remember I said about a foundation you got to have a foundation go to the second right build the first step then you you set that second step right down on top of that end of that first one so at the end of the first seal we're going to see the opening on the second SE God bless you thanks for coming happy Mother's Day to all you mothers than you
