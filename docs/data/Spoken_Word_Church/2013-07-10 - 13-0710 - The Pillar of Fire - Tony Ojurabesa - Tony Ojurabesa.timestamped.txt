[5:35] stay I thank Lord Jesus this hour for
[5:37] sending us a prophet amen he did not
[5:39] send us just a prophet he said not the
[5:42] mighty prophet and I've been pastoring
[5:45] now for the past 30 years the past three
[5:46] decades and the message of the hour I
[5:49] came to the Christian church I mean in
[5:51] 1968 over 45 years ago and I remember
[5:55] the Reverend father the first church I
[5:57] first went towards the Roman Catholic
[5:58] church and uh they I was from my school
[6:01] and the Reverend father was from Europe
[6:03] and and he one day you know those those
[6:06] preachers of those days even though
[6:07] they're in organizations there's
[6:09] something about them they have some
[6:10] spiritual gifts in their lives they
[6:12] don't have the giver but the parents
[6:13] about they have the gifts and the man
[6:15] looked at me I didn't know I was going
[6:16] to be a preacher because I don't like to
[6:18] be a creature I used to laugh at
[6:20] preachers or even Christians those days
[6:22] I never know I was going to be one
[6:23] myself you know but the man look at me
[6:26] said um
[6:28] would you like to be a priest I said uh
[6:32] yes sir I said but you're gonna have to
[6:34] talk to Daddy you're gonna have to talk
[6:36] to Chief and let him give you the uh
[6:38] they go ahead but I know you can never
[6:40] do that I can never go for my dad to ask
[6:41] him for permission my dad's not asking
[6:43] what's wrong with you who are you you
[6:45] know but um I thank Lord Jesus that
[6:47] doubt with that God said a foundation
[6:50] for me and little by little and from the
[6:53] Roman Catholic Church I went to Penn
[6:55] different Pentecostal organizations and
[6:56] things until one day one day yeah I said
[7:00] one day I heard the voice of Jehovah
[7:03] Eagle God the mother eagle and coming to
[7:06] come up out of those champagne and I
[7:07] appreciate the goodness alone thank Lord
[7:10] for Pastor Dale uh some years ago I
[7:12] would do some art teaching uh what do
[7:14] you call that Atlanta Georgia God bless
[7:16] him coming over there with the church
[7:18] and my brother brother
[7:20] um her brother here about her brother
[7:21] brother Collins God bless my brother
[7:23] came over there help us move stuff and
[7:25] things it's such a blessing to be with
[7:28] God's people I tell you there's no other
[7:30] group like this bread of Jesus Christ we
[7:33] are a special class of people sometimes
[7:35] people compare themselves with
[7:37] denominations I said don't you that's an
[7:39] insult you don't ever compare the bread
[7:42] of Christ with the Oneness Holiness
[7:44] Assemblies of God there but but as a
[7:47] matter of fact they are not even ashamed
[7:48] of God they are Assemblies of the devil
[7:50] God to assemble with God is to assemble
[7:52] with this word you have to be in the
[7:54] light of your day to assemble with him
[7:56] says the evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[7:58] all about and I really appreciate the
[8:00] Lord Jesus for the goodness of God in
[8:02] the ministry of this church and the
[8:04] puppet is not a place to joke or to try
[8:07] to flatter because Paul said that the
[8:09] spirit said we should name my brethren
[8:11] be not ye teachers of many things
[8:13] knowing that we're going to receive the
[8:15] greatest damnation we don't come here to
[8:17] just run our mouth people don't
[8:18] understand the job of a Preacher is a
[8:20] very dangerous one you know it's not an
[8:22] easy one to about appreciate the Lord
[8:23] Jesus Christ for the past of this church
[8:25] brother Samuel Dale so all the years I
[8:27] have known him I remember when I used to
[8:29] come to Georgia those years ago when I
[8:32] come to Georgia I only came to two
[8:34] people two pastors to preach for pastor
[8:36] Samuel Dell and brother old brother
[8:37] Wilson hambre then Covington Georgia
[8:39] those he asked you know before his wife
[8:41] after I just before his wife passed away
[8:42] or something and you know and since then
[8:45] but the deal has no change he has no
[8:46] move he still right with this world and
[8:49] that's what I thank God for you know
[8:51] hallelujah praise the Lord
[8:53] amen people there are a lot of things
[8:56] flying around today I told some bread
[8:58] and I said there and I hate to say that
[9:00] but I'm going to say the truth you know
[9:01] I I don't fear any man I only fear him
[9:04] right you know I only I respect man I
[9:07] don't fear any man we're not supposed to
[9:09] fear men the Bible said to fear the lord
[9:10] Jesus and and and and and there are some
[9:13] so many churches in the message today in
[9:15] North America that even if we are
[9:17] offered you know one million dollars for
[9:19] the deal We're not gonna go there
[9:21] because they of what they are doing or
[9:23] what they have done with this message of
[9:25] the hour in Africa we don't have the
[9:27] sister who tell your brother will tell
[9:28] you back there we don't have Medicare we
[9:30] don't have Medicaid we don't have I mean
[9:32] medical insurance all those stuff we
[9:34] don't have all those Richards Richard
[9:35] but when this one came to us right
[9:38] that's all we needed right there that's
[9:40] our Medicare that's our Medicare that's
[9:42] our you know you know Blessed assurance
[9:44] Jesus my Hallelujah and when once we got
[9:47] this message he ain't going no we got it
[9:48] you're not going to go anywhere right
[9:49] and for anybody to come and play with it
[9:52] this you know he's playing lives we're
[9:54] not going to let them we don't we're not
[9:55] going to play around and we'll not go
[9:57] around those two brothers whenever you
[9:58] see a man leave the word he say you
[10:00] leave that man alone I appreciate the
[10:02] Lord and they pass to pass past pastors
[10:04] I mean they may have some great time
[10:06] with him and sister Dale may God bless
[10:08] him please put your hands together
[10:10] so much you know you know we have heard
[10:14] that quote so many times brother answer
[10:15] whenever a man is called to the ministry
[10:17] if he's married his wife is called also
[10:19] you just don't understand the pressure
[10:21] that goes with this ministry I may
[10:23] Pastor all these years and I can tell
[10:24] you exactly the attempts that come from
[10:26] home to the church and I feel so happy
[10:28] singing dancing and driving comes to
[10:30] church and I do when I leave the church
[10:32] in the evening I'll be so sad that
[10:33] somebody didn't hurt my feelings in the
[10:34] church I said oh Lord God what did I do
[10:36] now you know that's how the past
[10:38] reminisce result is you know it's it's
[10:40] just the grace of God right but the
[10:41] branches The Minister's job is the most
[10:43] difficult in the world may God bless
[10:45] with the deal appreciate but the Wade
[10:47] God bless my dear friend put it together
[10:49] for my brother here please somebody I'll
[10:51] put you thank God for the word amen
[10:54] every time we see several attorneys
[10:56] smiling you know you just don't know
[10:57] what it is but Abraham says America
[10:59] sends money in domestic War has that
[11:02] what what has that Elijah he said
[11:04] America send money to all the world
[11:06] financial aids to all the world
[11:08] countries of the world to make friends
[11:10] they say and that's not those countries
[11:13] get back on their feet by their feet
[11:14] feet they turn their back around in
[11:16] America against America but the rest of
[11:18] you say see you can buy friendship with
[11:20] money that's right he said true
[11:22] friendship is a gift from God and I
[11:25] thank God today for good friends that
[11:27] Jesus said here are my friends and we
[11:29] are friends and that God brought us
[11:31] together we don't know anybody no no we
[11:33] don't know each other in this life but
[11:35] we've been together in his mind right
[11:36] before the foundation of the world so at
[11:38] the time the Lord for for them there's
[11:40] many things flying around the world
[11:42] today in the message of the hour we
[11:43] discuss many of them a lot of them
[11:45] yesterday and Pastor Dale and things and
[11:47] and it's just sad there's so many of
[11:50] their brothers that we started this race
[11:51] together if in fact those who have
[11:53] started risk for us
[11:55] those that should have known better
[11:57] those that you think will stay here they
[12:00] are all they mean they mean they're not
[12:01] missing for so many years they should be
[12:02] the pillar in the church but it won't
[12:04] going back by sliding today that's sad
[12:07] isn't it that's very sad because
[12:09] actually you know I believe a True
[12:11] Believer is like the wine the longer
[12:14] it's in the bottle the stronger it
[12:15] becomes yeah I mean these people uh
[12:18] they've been around for them in the
[12:19] message for so long a time and they just
[12:21] go back that's very sad now I thank love
[12:24] for wayfaring men who are present the
[12:26] battle and I may the Lord bless you
[12:28] today
[12:30] um I want to I want to I want to read a
[12:32] few things here before I preach my
[12:33] message God help me today I I'm not I've
[12:36] never preached here on Wednesday night

[12:50] there and eat some of the your American
[12:52] food you know that's what I like about
[12:54] America you know yesterday but the Dale
[12:57] took me to rise remember the deal
[12:58] brother Wayne and I appreciate his
[13:01] precious wife there somebody give her a
[13:02] hand somebody flick on the plates God
[13:04] bless sister Mr wait praise the Lord and
[13:07] sister Hannah right and back there we
[13:10] had a good time yesterday and her
[13:11] husband I tell you I enjoy the family
[13:13] but you know go downstairs after the
[13:15] morning service and eat some of the food
[13:17] yesterday at Ryan's they took me to the
[13:19] buffet I got all kind of food all over
[13:21] the place oh my God
[13:23] this all look good they might they might
[13:26] say they are hybrid but they smell good
[13:28] it tastes good too
[13:29] oh we thank God for his goodness but
[13:33] before us we sing it we sing a song with
[13:36] Jesus had a table spread where the
[13:39] saints of God are fed he invites his
[13:42] chosen people come and die and with his
[13:45] manner he don't Feed and Supply our
[13:48] every needs oh it's sweet to serve with
[13:51] Jesus all the time I'm so glad there's
[13:54] not no other place that's so sweet to be
[13:57] like at the table of the Lord that's why
[13:59] we receive strength receive healing
[14:01] receive encouragement and eternal life
[14:03] above all hallelujah amen so but the
[14:06] brand was when was was running of his
[14:08] ministry he taught the climax of the
[14:10] ministry he he said we are so grateful
[14:12] for the Gospel Light just imagine what
[14:15] this world will be or look like without
[14:17] this Gospel Light and when I said the
[14:20] gospel like I mean those there's only
[14:21] one gospel I'm not about the
[14:23] denomination forget about them shut them
[14:24] out I'm talking about the gospel the
[14:27] good news that Jesus Christ the same
[14:30] yesterday today and forever Hallelujah
[14:33] we thank the Lord for it but I'm still
[14:35] one thing about it is that Italian law
[14:37] that when the law sent him out there to
[14:39] preach the gospel this the gospel he has
[14:41] he did not play with the gospel but
[14:43] because the angel wrote all of the Lord
[14:45] told him in his Commission in the cave
[14:46] he said thou can be sincere
[14:49] and that's what's lacking today among
[14:51] the preachers if thou can be sincere and
[14:53] get people to believe you he said
[14:56] nothing shall stand before your prayers
[14:57] not even cancer this ministry requires a
[15:00] lot of a lot of sincerity you know and
[15:02] you know you but the Branson you must
[15:04] never try to deceive the ears of the
[15:06] people right and so but Abraham was
[15:07] saying that he hasn't he's not in our
[15:09] class he has never deceived the hears of
[15:11] the people and they came when they say
[15:13] we thank God for this Gospel Light and
[15:15] he said and and he said I'm like I feel
[15:17] like Jesus he said Jesus said to those
[15:20] those disciples before he left the Earth
[15:22] then he said what I hear I speak I have
[15:26] not hidden anything from you all that
[15:27] the father showed me I give to surely to
[15:29] you and brother Brown said and I also
[15:31] remember Apostle Paul when he was
[15:33] speaking in acts in 20 verse 27 when
[15:35] Paul said to those Elders that I have
[15:37] not shown to declare unto you the whole
[15:40] counsel of God and but the man said I
[15:42] may I join in the message Look Away to
[15:44] Jesus said may I join in tonight and say
[15:47] the same thing with that great sense of
[15:49] old he said to the best of my knowledge
[15:52] I have not not shunned but declared to
[15:55] you the whole counsel of God and that's
[15:58] exactly that's what William did he did
[16:01] not hold back anything from the bride
[16:02] because it is not his message it is his
[16:05] message and then he did not hold back
[16:07] anything and those of us who are old
[16:09] timers here but they were telling me
[16:11] that we have a couple five six brothers
[16:13] here Believers here who are actually
[16:15] witnessed by the Browns Ministry you all
[16:17] that are there may God bless you we
[16:18] weren't there but we read about the
[16:20] message I thank God for the message
[16:22] but I also thank God for the spirit of
[16:24] the message because you can say people
[16:27] said they believed the message but they
[16:29] don't have the spirit of the message so
[16:31] therefore they were stuck in their
[16:33] intellectual mind they try to figure out
[16:35] what Ram was saying that's why they're
[16:36] all messed up but if you have the spirit
[16:38] of the message you have the Holy Ghost
[16:40] the spirit of Revelation that makes
[16:43] Jesus realer to realize English say make
[16:46] Jesus realer to you amen and and during
[16:49] Brothers Ministry we know his ministry
[16:52] is a very unique Ministry it's not the
[16:54] kind of riffraff or all kind of
[16:57] preachers past but now it's just a
[16:59] preacher or a pastor but Abraham was a
[17:01] prophet
[17:02] if the prophet and and we we remember
[17:06] how that his ministry uh was in three
[17:09] phases 333 polls and we know the Frozen
[17:12] second polls what now for us the first
[17:14] example is for the campaign it's just an
[17:17] attraction together the crowd and we
[17:19] remember the first pool was the sign in
[17:21] the hands whereby it can with this left
[17:23] hand it can hold their your right hand
[17:25] and then his head on the tip of his
[17:28] fingers to his elbow which in color
[17:29] whether to blue or purple to tell the
[17:32] kind of disease the person has I said
[17:34] sir you're a shadow you have a cancer or
[17:36] something like that and then the angel
[17:38] Allah by the answer come to pass that
[17:41] you also know the intents of the hearts
[17:43] of man but when I said that happened the
[17:45] first time when he was in Florida or
[17:46] something that was able to disarm it was
[17:48] the hearts and things tell them what to
[17:50] do many years back and everything and
[17:53] what they need to do to get straightened
[17:54] up and things and then we also remember
[17:56] that I'm so enthused and so excited he
[18:00] began to you know explain those give
[18:02] those four two gifts and even even the
[18:05] brothers who are even the mess they were
[18:06] following him then uh every time
[18:08] Advanced is going to to to to to to to
[18:10] to to to hunt they say oh brother then
[18:13] right now we go with you we're gonna go
[18:14] with you but actually the them brothers
[18:16] are not actually going to hunt they were
[18:18] going there to use the gift and when
[18:21] they got to the to the woods huh they
[18:23] would live put their leave their gun
[18:25] down there on the floor on the ground
[18:27] and go to talk about that brand they
[18:28] know because that's not they start
[18:30] talking about the Branham the vision
[18:31] will break up even to see visions and
[18:34] things like that even though they know
[18:36] about the brown said every time it goes
[18:37] to to hunt he's just going there to rest
[18:39] a little bit and you know but see he
[18:42] explained the first and the second pole
[18:44] of his ministry and there are all and
[18:47] there are all kind of impersonation that
[18:49] came out of that uh and to the point
[18:52] that the union of law said that he's
[18:54] trying to teach Pentecostal babes
[18:56] Supernatural things so you can do that
[18:58] you know and then we remember our
[19:00] various preachers like A.A Allen like
[19:02] even though our robots remember foreign
[19:04] Kansas City remember my brother or a
[19:08] robot Apple Branham he said that you
[19:10] think God can answer my prayers like
[19:12] this but Abraham says sure do you answer
[19:14] anybody's prayer and our Robert said
[19:17] well here I go and they might went in
[19:19] the ministry and started became a big
[19:20] old uh big Prosperity preacher or
[19:23] whatever more and different ones that
[19:24] also follow him after that the voice of
[19:26] healing erita God only see how many of
[19:28] them and those guys they used they
[19:30] impersonated the first the first two
[19:32] polls and what they do to pull crowd for
[19:36] themselves they did not pull crowd to
[19:39] Jesus they tried to use William Brown's
[19:41] Ministries to make themselves big shots
[19:42] I was in Canada sometimes last year and
[19:45] I heard but the day I heard about uh
[19:47] about arm Bast Baxter quote by the Rams
[19:51] campaign manager for a while he was
[19:53] pastored in Canada and after I left this
[19:55] church and then followed by the ram to
[19:57] be his manager for a while and after a
[19:59] while I believe in California one time
[20:01] saying I'm going back to my church my
[20:03] church is looking for
[20:04] but actually when he left that time it's
[20:07] not because you want to leave he was
[20:08] going to have his own outfit set up now
[20:11] it was no longer last year somebody was
[20:12] telling me that Ambassador has a bible
[20:15] school then in Canada and he even denied
[20:17] all the supernatural things that he saw
[20:20] on the William Brothers Ministry you see
[20:22] what we're talking about these are
[20:24] people that saw the stood to sat there
[20:26] and they watched the supernatural took
[20:28] place in William Brown Ministry and they
[20:30] are denied today sister Salah it does is
[20:32] not something that's that's that's
[20:33] that's that's sad but after the angel of
[20:36] Lord told me the Brahman he said the
[20:38] third pool cannot be impersonated
[20:41] and you know and and but the man said
[20:43] I'm pouring my heart to you through the
[20:45] opening of the world he said because if
[20:47] the spirit of Christ if the love of
[20:48] Christ in me I cannot you know give the
[20:51] love of Christ to you if I have the
[20:53] spirit of beetle of Beethoven I must
[20:56] sing like Beethoven if I have the spirit
[20:58] of Shakespeare I write poems and write
[21:01] dramas like like Shakespeare and he said
[21:03] and if Christ lives in me he said the
[21:06] worst of Christ I'll do
[21:07] so right it's got to be and he said and
[21:11] what is Christ he said the word
[21:14] he said if he abide in me and my wording
[21:17] you then ask what you will it will be
[21:19] done because the word is there see it
[21:22] just need the light to Quicken it you
[21:24] know and the light makes it leave he
[21:26] said so now you say I'm gonna say
[21:28] something to you now that I have not
[21:30] said Allah all along and that is the
[21:33] thing that we've I've looked forward to
[21:35] for so long for at least many years four
[21:38] or five years or maybe longer the third
[21:41] pool has not been Vindicated I want to
[21:44] put my keyword to use the word
[21:46] Vindicated as my keyword there because I
[21:48] know these are 10 places three after the
[21:51] opening of seven zeros when I see going
[21:52] until now God is still vindicating the
[21:55] third person now because the blood of
[21:57] Jesus Christ is sort of play and use the
[21:59] major part of the Tuple number the plan
[22:01] right amen so and they said that now
[22:04] remember there will never be an
[22:06] impersonation of that because it cannot
[22:09] be see it cannot be it can now it's in
[22:13] existence
[22:19] he said right at this time now it's just
[22:22] happened why everyone was preaching
[22:24] remember when I was preaching at seventh
[22:25] seal uh with the Sunday with the pastor
[22:28] today I believe but the brother was
[22:29] three on seven seal and there was no way
[22:31] but around we'll talk about the seventh
[22:33] seventh seal without talking about
[22:35] himself because that is his seal that is
[22:39] the bright seal so there is just now
[22:41] possible for him to talk about about 70
[22:44] without himself and Angela said stop
[22:46] right there it is in the summer so if
[22:48] you remember in seals so don't know
[22:49] about it and here in this message Look
[22:51] Away to Jesus he started to talk about
[22:53] his third pull again and then you can
[22:55] say stop number runs it just happened
[22:57] right now he said I should stop you know
[22:59] and why he said so he said he asked me
[23:01] to stop right now so it could identify
[23:03] it's identify its presence among you see
[23:06] but it will not be used in a greater way
[23:09] until this Council begins to tighten up
[23:13] and when it does so when that does the
[23:17] Pentecostals and so forth can almost
[23:19] impersonate anything right
[23:22] right then why are you surprised by Ben
[23:23] Hina Benny Hinn having Crusade and heal
[23:26] him campaign and everything because
[23:28] that's what runs are going to happen
[23:29] after the open of the world when this
[23:32] when we're getting close to this to the
[23:34] squeeze the Pentecostal were built
[23:36] impersonate almost anything
[23:38] you know and it's happening already
[23:39] right now he said but when that time
[23:41] comes when the squeeze comes down there
[23:45] you will see what you've seen
[23:46] temporarily
[23:48] be manifested in the fullness of his
[23:51] power and he said see c c c four times
[23:56] that's emphasis praise the Lord he said
[23:59] everyone knows that for as certain as
[24:01] the frost at Frost was identified for
[24:03] the two so has the second been
[24:05] identified and if you will think real
[24:07] closely you who are spiritual
[24:09] as the Bible said here is to him that
[24:12] has wisdom he said the third is properly
[24:14] identified see we know where it is so
[24:18] the topic will say what is the Tuple the
[24:20] purple is the opening of the word the
[24:22] fullness of the world we call it the
[24:24] seven Thunders these Seven Seals got the
[24:27] seven thunders at the Revelation
[24:28] containing the seven zeros what is it
[24:30] the surround climax of William Brampton
[24:32] Ministry
[24:33] the evening Shadow remember this evening
[24:36] Shadow remember the evening light the
[24:39] review word that's the third pool praise
[24:41] the Lord and so when the Bible said it
[24:43] is so sacred for three it is so sacred
[24:46] that I mustn't say much about it
[24:49] as he told me in the beginning said he
[24:51] said this say nothing of it so you
[24:53] remember that years ago they say amen he
[24:55] said it speaks for itself the word the
[24:58] fullness of the word speaks for assembly
[25:00] Richard he said see but two he said I've
[25:03] tried to explain the others and I made a
[25:05] mistake said but this the purple the
[25:08] fullness of the word will be the thing
[25:10] that to my opinion I don't say the Lord
[25:14] tells me this
[25:16] this will be the thing that will start
[25:19] the rapturing faith for the going away
[25:21] see
[25:22] the turtle the opening of the word and
[25:25] that's why I told you I said no wonder
[25:27] Satan has been so much against this
[25:29] message at this stage because it is no
[25:32] longer the gifts anymore there's nobody
[25:33] campaign anymore it's the truth the
[25:35] fullness of the word and Satan doesn't
[25:38] like the truth he hears the truth yes
[25:40] exactly right he said now talk about
[25:42] this quiz he said then let's come this
[25:44] quiz the next we are waiting for right
[25:46] now is this quiz but this quiz has to
[25:48] come before the Rapture before the body
[25:50] change and but the man said in uh in in
[25:53] inverse paragraph 44 of them as I said
[25:55] now I must lay acquired for just a while
[25:57] and he did it's been Restless since then
[25:59] right in glory paragraph 45 he said
[26:01] there is coming a time talking about
[26:03] this quiz there is coming a Time upon in
[26:06] this nation America is talking about
[26:08] here in America this nation to where
[26:12] this nation is going to exercise all the
[26:15] power that the Beast had before it
[26:17] that's Rome
[26:21] that this nation will do that
[26:25] brothers and sisters you say America
[26:27] cannot do it you're gonna do it we see
[26:29] what America did near Iraq because she
[26:31] had the military power she has shown
[26:33] that she can do it she brought it in
[26:35] 1992 during the Gulf War America has
[26:39] enough power and influence to bring the
[26:41] Allied Nations together and nobody
[26:43] resisted him her she had the power to do
[26:45] that praise the Lord and recently the
[26:47] war in Iraq and Afghanistan America has
[26:50] shown the world what he she can do
[26:52] praise the Lord but it's not going to
[26:54] stop there because she also had a
[26:56] religious power also remember she came
[26:58] up in Revelation 13 like a lamb which is
[27:01] a religious power and but the man said
[27:03] well Euro revision 13 He said now and
[27:07] the dragon is Rome always so don't you
[27:10] see
[27:11] see Roman denomination paragraph 47 a
[27:15] mark
[27:15] Protestant denomination and image unto
[27:18] the beast making the power that will
[27:20] force all Protestants right like into
[27:23] like a union you see you will have to be
[27:27] into this castle of churches or you
[27:29] won't be able to have Fellowship I told
[27:31] people with Nigeria even in Florida
[27:32] during the convention last weekend I
[27:34] said people those of you like to run
[27:36] away from church when they shot the
[27:37] doors of our church you don't have to
[27:39] worry them no more right because you
[27:41] ain't going to have no church to go to
[27:42] them but right now the pastor is begging
[27:44] is preaching the preachers are begging
[27:45] and say please come to church come to
[27:47] church see Paul the Bible says not to
[27:49] forsake the garden of one another as a
[27:52] manner of some but Abraham said you see
[27:54] those some are unbelievers because
[27:56] Believers go to church God goes to
[27:59] church but around certainly man and that
[28:01] may say as an eagle start our next he
[28:02] said before we come to church he said
[28:04] the angel of Lord are here for us to
[28:07] prepare the service before we got here
[28:08] that's why them demons don't have a
[28:10] chance and after this and they make sure
[28:13] that the service go through the song
[28:14] service went through successfully and
[28:16] the preaching goes through successfully
[28:18] and then at the end of the service God
[28:20] detail one Angel each to each of us to
[28:23] follow up oh Hallelujah just imagine
[28:26] security of the angels I haven't started
[28:29] preaching here maybe I wouldn't preach
[28:30] now just help me Lord you know and God
[28:32] will send each of us with an Angel
[28:34] you know talk about the CIA or FBI from
[28:37] Heaven follow me to protect me
[28:39] hallelujah amen and to is that to keep
[28:42] you and to watch over you and to keep
[28:44] you safe
[28:45] that's how powerful it is so that's why
[28:48] we come to church but see they said they
[28:50] will close our church and would not be
[28:52] able to have Fellowship anymore but all
[28:54] this Pokemon would have been eaten on
[28:56] you know he said hit the book right
[28:57] we've been eating on this what's wrong
[28:58] word that's when they will come to
[29:00] effect in our life and the third pool
[29:02] will take effect the world will become
[29:04] flesh like we have never seen before
[29:05] before then you know we are close to the
[29:07] body change
[29:09] well see they will close the churches
[29:12] down uh
[29:16] it's practically that way now that's as
[29:19] a December 29 1963. he said it's
[29:22] practically that way now but Odell he
[29:24] said uh you can go to a church and
[29:27] preach then
[29:28] unless you have a fellowship card or
[29:31] some identification you see you see and
[29:33] now
[29:34] on Persons like us Mercy believers
[29:37] we are going to be caught out of all
[29:40] that all together we will not be part of
[29:42] that Union of churches right and that's
[29:45] exactly he said because they won't be
[29:47] able to do it
[29:49] why because the power of the thoughtful
[29:51] in us will hold us up it's a stabilizer
[29:53] but everybody say our stabilizer holds
[29:55] in the word it is not you holding him
[29:58] it's him holding us you won't be able to
[30:00] do that they will put pressure on us you
[30:03] know and they will get the sweetness of
[30:05] God out of us for that you know when you
[30:07] buy you buy an orange nice good wrapping
[30:10] orange you don't get the taste of it
[30:12] until you squeeze it right and this
[30:14] bride will be squeezed by these churches
[30:15] and they will see the power of God out
[30:17] of our Lives you know that we shouldn't
[30:19] go in the Rapture Hallelujah but if I
[30:21] said now it's tightening up now you
[30:23] start me now it's starting now yes they
[30:25] are starting now now they they know who
[30:27] you are don't think they don't know who
[30:29] you are they know you they have your ID
[30:31] they have it on internet they know where
[30:34] you live they know where you work they
[30:37] know how much you make right they do
[30:39] remember that boy is nodding that just
[30:41] exposed the NSA his name is in Russia
[30:44] right now you know trying to get some
[30:46] Asylum somewhere but you know what
[30:47] they're not the government it's not just
[30:49] spying on the people but the way they've
[30:51] been doing it for so many years so they
[30:54] know what every time you make your phone
[30:56] call they listen in every time
[30:58] Hallelujah so they know what's going on
[31:00] so when the time comes they know those
[31:03] they know where you live
[31:05] so that's why we're saying we better get
[31:06] the Holy Ghost now
[31:08] we feel the Holy Spirit right in the
[31:09] fire of God now be still into the body
[31:12] of Christ right now because before
[31:13] because tomorrow might be too late he
[31:15] said so he said so therefore he said
[31:17] that and I standing up now and then when
[31:19] that time comes and the Press comes to a
[31:22] place to where you are pressed out he
[31:25] said then watch what I'm fixing to tell
[31:27] you in a few minutes watch the third
[31:30] pull then see and it will be absolutely
[31:33] to the total loss but to be for the
[31:35] bride and the church so now we are
[31:37] closer than it seem to be say I don't
[31:39] know when but it's real real close and I
[31:42] said today in Gainesville Georgia 2013
[31:45] is real real close events being made
[31:49] clear by prophecy there's no hope in
[31:51] this world anymore there's no no there's
[31:53] no hope anymore the government don't
[31:55] know what to do anymore they have no
[31:56] solution to life trouble
[31:58] this world will not know peace on the
[32:00] Prince of Peace returns to the Earth
[32:01] again Hallelujah so now we are really
[32:03] close then it seems to be I don't know
[32:05] when but it's real real close I may be
[32:07] building a platform for somebody else to
[32:09] step on I will be taken before that time
[32:11] I wish he was I don't know and I finally
[32:14] said and I want to say this I've never
[32:17] said it before but according to
[32:19] scripture according to what he said 33
[32:22] years ago 30 years ago 33 years ago on
[32:24] the river down there in Ohio uh 1933
[32:28] rather what he said everything has
[32:30] happened just exactly I may not do it
[32:33] but this message
[32:35] will introduce Jesus Christ to the world
[32:37] and he's doing it right now it doesn't
[32:40] matter how many scoffers we have the
[32:41] message right now because right now
[32:42] we're having people denying this message
[32:44] proclaiming all kind of nonsense against
[32:46] William Branham they claim that a
[32:48] mystery the cloud was not real they step
[32:51] around made some mistakes I don't who
[32:52] care about his mistake I already got in
[32:54] my message that was sent to me I don't
[32:57] care about no mistake if you come even
[32:59] to a local assembly if you come here to
[33:00] look for Mystic you're going to see
[33:01] plenty here
[33:02] are you following me but at the same
[33:04] time you come to see Jesus you're going
[33:06] to see the Lord here because it's right
[33:07] here you say we're about two or three I
[33:09] got that in my name there I will be in
[33:11] their means and if people come to this
[33:12] message to look for thought because he
[33:14] plenty of mistakes too you know but if
[33:16] they come to see Jehovah and Murphy
[33:18] Christ in his bride they will see it
[33:21] also bless me I ain't here to look for
[33:23] no missing this message I'm here to see
[33:25] Jesus Christ and I've seen already I
[33:27] ain't going nowhere anymore are you
[33:28] following me so he said uh um so they
[33:31] have about I may not do it but this
[33:32] message will introduce Jesus Christ to
[33:34] the world
[33:35] for as John the Baptist was sent to
[33:37] foreign
[33:43] coming and John said behold the land of
[33:46] Lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[33:49] the world see so it is parallel it
[33:51] parallel in every way and I know it will
[33:54] and he said this message will go on this
[33:58] message will go on brother I don't care
[34:00] who is against it I don't care who is

[36:45] name in Jesus Christ's name we prayed
[36:49] amen
[36:51] Exodus the first chapters the third
[36:53] chapter verses one to six
[36:57] now
[36:59] Moses kept the flock of Jethro his
[37:01] father-in-law the priests of median
[37:04] and he led the flock to the backside of
[37:06] the desert and came to the Mountain of
[37:08] God even to Horeb
[37:11] and the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[37:12] him watch in the flame of fire
[37:17] out of the midst of a bush
[37:20] and he looked and behold the bush burned
[37:23] with fire
[37:24] and the Bush was not consumed
[37:27] and Moses said I will now turn aside
[37:32] and see this great sight
[37:34] why the bush is not burnt
[37:37] and when the Lord saw that he turned
[37:39] aside to see
[37:41] God called unto him out of the midst of
[37:43] the Bush and said Moses Moses
[37:48] and he said here am I
[37:51] and it said draw not neither
[37:55] put off thy shoes from all thy feet for
[37:59] the place we are on thousandest is Holy
[38:02] Ground
[38:03] moreover he said I am the god of thy
[38:07] father
[38:08] the god of Abraham
[38:11] the god of Isaac
[38:13] and the god of Jacob
[38:15] and Moses hid his face
[38:17] for he was afraid to look upon God may
[38:24] the Lord bless the reading of his holy
[38:25] word we may be seated this this evening
[38:32] tonight I want to speak to you Sins Of
[38:34] God for next few minutes on this subject
[38:36] of the pillar of Fire
[38:39] blessed be the name of the Lord
[38:42] I I was reading um uh quotes right there
[38:46] while I was in the office there but
[38:47] Brown was talking the message
[38:48] exhortation of Divine Healing in 1951
[38:51] May the the first and was praying during
[38:54] the prayer line they said and father my
[38:56] desire is tonight personally that you
[38:59] will magnify yourself before the people
[39:02] in this day
[39:03] to let them know that your spirit your
[39:06] spirit that your word that your promise
[39:09] oh master your promise it is written the
[39:13] scripture that you heal the people that
[39:15] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[39:17] the prophet
[39:18] you did these things that it might be
[39:20] fulfilled and oh Lord God Of Heaven
[39:22] these things we do tonight that might be
[39:25] fulfilled which was spoken by our Master
[39:27] these things that I do he said shall you
[39:30] also so he knew the house of the people
[39:32] he knew what was wrong with them and the
[39:35] spirit is here Brothers here how many
[39:37] believe that night spirit is here
[39:38] tonight he healed the people and father
[39:41] this is tonight to fulfill which was
[39:43] said by our Master going into all the
[39:45] world and preach the gospel lay hands on
[39:48] the sick and they shall recover
[39:50] you see and Grant Lord that you will
[39:53] send tonight your Great Divine Angel
[39:56] somebody say Amen tonight your Great
[39:59] Divine Angel your healing spirit
[40:02] maybe it's the same angel that was on
[40:05] the pull of Bethesda we do not know I do
[40:08] not know him father in that way his name
[40:11] maybe it's the same angel that followed
[40:13] the children of Israel that led them
[40:15] rather in the sign of a pillar of fire
[40:18] maybe it does a simpler fire that we are
[40:22] looking at right now tonight in this
[40:24] church maybe he's here tonight here no
[40:26] maybe he's here tonight Hallelujah and
[40:28] and I thought that he will be and will
[40:30] show great science and wonders I mean
[40:32] the outcome is tearing among the people
[40:34] quickly for we realize Lord that we just
[40:37] have a few days to be here right now
[40:40] that's done with the absolute truth we
[40:42] have much time to stay in this world we
[40:45] are nearing home we are closer to home
[40:46] people I was we went to the church to
[40:49] the to the hospital today with the
[40:50] pastor and we pray for the George George
[40:53] Canada and we press it I would say
[40:55] brother will soon going to be home we
[40:57] are nearly home we are almost home
[40:58] brother you know and then the devil have
[41:01] no power or control over this pleasure
[41:02] anymore we'll be living in perfect
[41:04] Perfection I look at him on the bed
[41:07] tonight and I saw my and the pastor
[41:09] didn't know it but while he step out to
[41:11] take care of something with the daughter
[41:12] how did she has just rolled on my from
[41:14] my eyes I said this is Brother Canada
[41:16] the last time I saw him I was in his
[41:18] house I have just preached for about the
[41:20] Dale I preached for the Dale here
[41:22] morning and evening I remember the
[41:24] brothers Andrew head and uh Joseph
[41:27] Canada took me to their daddy in the
[41:29] house and I held his hand in his house
[41:31] and we prayed and that building shook
[41:34] but the Lander would tell it the
[41:35] anointing came down so smiling his house
[41:37] and that was the last time I saw him and
[41:39] today when I saw him was on the bed he
[41:40] can't even talk back to me you see he
[41:43] shows that here we have no continuing
[41:44] City people
[41:46] and
[41:47] I believe that sometimes we need to
[41:49] remind ourselves for that purpose remind
[41:52] ourselves of the the about the things
[41:54] about this common salvation that we
[41:56] share that we share this conservation
[41:58] that brought us together in this evening
[42:00] light at this crucial hour and when I
[42:04] first came to the United States many
[42:05] years ago people of God I remember that
[42:07] there was a lot of Fellowship in America
[42:08] I remember remember those days we
[42:12] traveled to different meetings brothers
[42:13] having meetings conventional over the
[42:14] United States in Canada and it just
[42:17] seems that right now that it's not like
[42:18] that no more it's like everybody is now
[42:21] on to himself and and it wasn't that
[42:23] this preachers but Richard they just
[42:24] can't instead of working for the master
[42:26] each of them is trying to build a
[42:28] kingdom for themselves and I tell that's
[42:30] very sad isn't it we are not called to
[42:32] come and build the kingdom for ourselves
[42:34] we are servants we are on what is
[42:36] servants it's not even our message it is
[42:40] his message and that should make us even
[42:42] fear how we relate with this message how
[42:45] we handle this message we should handle
[42:48] this message with fear and trembling not
[42:50] to play with this message but also when
[42:52] Israel came to Goshen when the angel of
[42:55] death was going through that night said
[42:56] they are not there to discuss the
[42:58] message they were there to apply the
[43:00] token
[43:02] the end time message applies the token
[43:04] which means you can never receive the
[43:06] genuine but it's not Holy Ghost answer
[43:09] that this message you have but Abraham
[43:11] said also said in seven Church ages book
[43:12] he said total obedience to the word of
[43:15] God and that was the believer to the
[43:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's the
[43:19] turbulent action right there you know
[43:21] and and and I'm so sad that today is not
[43:24] no no no no it's not like that anymore
[43:26] and the different preachers saying all
[43:29] kind of stuff and and even short members
[43:31] too they are taking over from them he
[43:33] didn't install the people he started the
[43:34] preachers but you know because you hear
[43:37] the Bible but the Collins grandson was
[43:40] claiming that kind of stuff against him
[43:42] saying that but after 36 years in the
[43:45] message he will was born and raised the
[43:46] message by his Granddaddy and that boy I
[43:49] went on the website in Florida and my
[43:51] heart just bled within me to see what
[43:53] that boy put on the internet openly to
[43:55] the world took interview in the
[43:57] television stations to denounce William
[43:59] Branham to say the Bible was forced but
[44:03] Abraham did not they are the the mystery
[44:05] Club was not genuine all kind of nurse
[44:08] and Mary Mary Rose prophecy was not
[44:10] genuine I said what is wrong with this
[44:12] boy you see but see their problem
[44:14] started with the preachers but the Bible
[44:16] says but in any people it's the leaders
[44:18] of the people he said in every age it's
[44:20] like that it's not the people see see
[44:23] people the preachers yeah that's why I
[44:25] said you are blessing against Georgia
[44:27] you might not understand but I know what
[44:29] I'm talking about because in some
[44:30] Churches of the message they don't care
[44:32] about the Holy Ghost no more all
[44:33] anything goes there brother and today
[44:36] I've been in denomination over this all
[44:38] the many years of fighting the message
[44:39] and all my years in the nomination I
[44:42] never witnessed a minister in
[44:44] organization come before for me and tell
[44:47] lies to my face
[44:48] but I've seen that this message people
[44:50] I've seen preachers in the message tell
[44:52] lies for the richest to my face I said
[44:55] brother I totally preacher one time
[44:56] South Carolina I said brother you said
[44:58] that I said brother put your hand in
[45:00] this Bible and look at me straight in
[45:01] the eyes and someone just told me it's
[45:03] true and just said well he said that's
[45:05] just a book I said what that's the Bible
[45:08] brother that's the Word of Life brother
[45:12] oh mercy God have mercy on this
[45:15] preachers
[45:16] but that's what is going on today we we
[45:18] cannot believe this message and I I see
[45:21] what I'm saying people are changing
[45:22] every day the churches are changing a
[45:25] problem with the statement here in the
[45:26] in the unchanging God he said but we
[45:29] find out that the churches change they
[45:31] are changing thoroughly my father used
[45:33] to say when he was alive he said you
[45:35] know if you have a friend that you have
[45:38] not seen like about a year a good friend
[45:39] of yours see next time you see him you
[45:41] got to be very careful you better watch
[45:43] out because since the last time you saw
[45:45] him you don't know what he has turned to
[45:47] yeah you don't know where he's been
[45:48] hanging around so you better watch out
[45:50] and try to study what is it what it is
[45:52] right now because he may not be the guy
[45:54] you used to know before
[45:55] and that's the same with the churches
[45:56] today and with the preachers today when
[45:58] you see them few years and simply next
[46:00] time he better watch out that be careful
[46:02] now you know what they are believing now
[46:03] you don't know what they are preaching
[46:05] now you know you have to you know be on
[46:07] guard and everything you know he said
[46:09] but we found out that churches change
[46:10] and the people changes Road changes yeah
[46:14] I see all kind of construction America
[46:15] going on he said that the same changes
[46:18] even even the politics changes politics
[46:21] changes too whoever thought that a black
[46:24] man will be in the white house today as
[46:27] a president of America
[46:32] that's not gonna happen if black man in
[46:34] the White House how is he gonna die
[46:36] who's gonna put him there how's it going
[46:38] to get there but today we shall have one
[46:40] day Obama I ain't no politician people
[46:43] I'm a Christian now I don't vote for
[46:45] nobody you know I only casted one vote
[46:48] and that's for the Lord Jesus Christ and
[46:49] that say I'm done are you following me
[46:51] but politics have changed I know it's
[46:54] very hard for the for the Republicans to
[46:55] to swallow it but they cannot change it
[46:58] because polities have changed and the
[47:00] same thing people have changed churches
[47:03] have changed but it runs about there's
[47:05] one thing that does not change and that
[47:07] is God
[47:08] Hallelujah he said he Remains the Same
[47:11] he said I am God and I change not so no
[47:15] matter how long it is that God has never
[47:17] changed one bit and it cannot change he
[47:21] said what a place he said the reason he
[47:23] cannot change is because God is infinite
[47:28] and anything that is infinite can not
[47:31] change
[47:33] Hallelujah and guess what the good part
[47:35] of it is that when we receive the Holy
[47:36] Ghost his spirit will become infinite
[47:39] too Jehovah and Murphy Christ in form of
[47:43] his bride I always tell the people when
[47:45] you when you become a Christian in this
[47:47] basically the Holy Ghost don't look down
[47:49] yourself anymore you got power you
[47:52] become little Jesus that's why he said
[47:54] in Marx 16 this sign shall follow them
[47:57] that I believe in my name shall they
[47:59] cast out Devils he wasn't playing it's
[48:02] not just a word it's a promise and I try
[48:06] it every time and it's worse for me in
[48:08] Nigeria now in church we see I've seen
[48:10] the dead raised I've seen God heal the
[48:13] sick my own father went blind I blessed
[48:16] him he received his side back in this
[48:19] message if anybody nobody can tell me
[48:22] now that this message is not true I will
[48:23] say brother you come too late brother
[48:25] you're too late man Hallelujah you are
[48:28] too late because I have seen the
[48:30] evidence of the good land Hallelujah
[48:32] that God is truth is worth it and this
[48:35] message is true Blessed Be His holy name
[48:39] I believe it's very important for us
[48:41] face of God in in Gainesville
[48:43] to cherish and appreciate the mystery of
[48:47] God
[48:48] revealed to us in this last days by the
[48:51] seventh angel
[48:52] a Francis revision 10 1-7
[48:56] when I'm talking about the pillar of
[48:58] fire today
[48:59] when we're back in the organization
[49:02] um we don't hear much about the pillar
[49:04] of Fire
[49:05] neither knew we its importance
[49:09] as related to the presence or the deity
[49:11] of God or even the bathroom Holy Ghost
[49:15] but this message by the grace of God
[49:17] through the opening of The Seven Seals
[49:19] has started a whole lot amen about the
[49:22] mystery of God than any Christian groups
[49:25] as the War Began you know when that Paul
[49:28] cried out in first Timothy 3 verse 16
[49:30] and he said and in the class that with
[49:33] that controversy with that argument he
[49:37] said great is the mystery of godliness
[49:39] now I did not say Mysteries that's a
[49:42] plural it's a mystery as of singular
[49:44] right am I am I right there it's a
[49:47] mystery as of singular and then
[49:49] Revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice
[49:52] of the seventh angel when his Shah began
[49:55] to sound the mystery of God not
[49:58] Mysteries as a plural singular the
[50:01] mystery of God should be finished as he
[50:03] had declared to his servants the
[50:05] prophets what was it the opening of the
[50:08] word this the the this Revelation 10 7
[50:11] is what revealed and produced the one
[50:14] the true Oneness of God in this hour
[50:15] what is the true wonders of God man and
[50:18] God becoming one
[50:20] Jesus said and that day what day this
[50:23] day ye shall know that I am any father
[50:26] and the father in me are in you and you
[50:29] and me only this message it makes men
[50:32] and God one
[50:33] by the New Birth by the general barcelon
[50:37] Holy Ghost because when you when you
[50:38] were born again you're converting this
[50:40] message and you got the only goes you
[50:42] got God in you you don't got just a
[50:44] little God you got the whole of God in
[50:46] you because every element every Power
[50:49] every attributes that made the create of
[50:52] Heaven are not God that's what's inside
[50:54] of you too
[50:56] the Holy Ghost he got no power to speak
[50:59] another word into existence and God live
[51:02] there Hallelujah Blessed Be oh
[51:06] Hallelujah Blessed Be His holy name in
[51:09] John chapter 8 verse 56 I'm going to
[51:12] read this scripture right quickly in
[51:14] John 8 verse uh we read verse 52 right
[51:17] quickly 258.
[51:20] uh Hallelujah they came to Jesus then
[51:22] the Bible said there that then said the
[51:25] Jews unto him to Jesus
[51:27] now we know that thou has a devil
[51:31] Abraham is dead and the prophets and
[51:34] thou says if a man keep my saying he
[51:36] shall never taste of death
[51:38] are thou greater than our Father Abraham
[51:41] which is dead
[51:43] and the prophets are dead
[51:46] whom make us doubt I said who are you
[51:49] who Do You Think You Are
[51:51] and Jesus answered
[51:53] if I honor myself my honor is nothing
[51:57] it is my father that honored me of whom
[52:00] ye say that he is your god
[52:03] say yet ye have not known him I hate to
[52:06] say that people there are a lot of
[52:07] people in this message they don't know
[52:08] who God is
[52:10] they don't even know who this messenger
[52:12] is he is at all he said that and but yet
[52:14] he have yet he have not known him but I
[52:17] know him
[52:18] and if I should say I know him not I
[52:21] shall be a liar like unto you that's the
[52:24] first time Jesus ever called a man a
[52:26] liar
[52:27] so shall be a liar like unto you but I
[52:31] know him
[52:32] and keep his sane he said your father
[52:35] Abraham rejoiced to see my day and he
[52:39] saw it I was glad I'm sure but Tommy
[52:42] said oh what do you hear that and Jesus
[52:45] and they said he do something Thou Art
[52:47] not yet 50 years old and has thou seen
[52:50] Abraham what
[52:53] and Jesus said unto them verily verily I
[52:57] say unto you
[52:58] before Abraham was
[53:01] I am
[53:04] so in our text tonight sins of God
[53:09] when Moses taught to God and he asked
[53:11] God who he is
[53:13] who should I tell them talk to me he
[53:16] said tell them I am talk to you
[53:19] isn't that something I'm going to read
[53:21] that Exodus the third chapter again but
[53:23] I'll read now verse 13 and 14. read with
[53:25] me he said and Moses said unto God
[53:28] behold when I come unto the children of
[53:30] Israel and shall say unto them the god
[53:33] of your fathers has sent me unto you and
[53:35] they shall send to me what is his name
[53:38] what shall I say unto them
[53:40] and God said unto Moses
[53:42] I am that I am
[53:46] and he said those shall thou say unto
[53:49] the children of Israel I am has sent
[53:53] me
[53:55] unto you amen so God
[53:58] here in our test tonight
[54:00] Moses tell the people that I am sent you
[54:05] to them
[54:06] but I want us to notice something today
[54:08] the sins of God that I am is not a name
[54:11] I am is an expression
[54:14] but that's how much is new God I am
[54:17] I am that's just an expression right
[54:20] right I am your healer
[54:23] I am your savior
[54:25] I am your king
[54:28] I am the lily of the valley
[54:31] the rose of Sharon and the brother
[54:33] Morning Star
[54:34] I am the Alpha and the Omega it's an
[54:38] expression
[54:39] I am the beginning and the ending
[54:42] I am the first and the last and you take
[54:45] that what I am I am I am from that point
[54:48] in Exodus although it's Revelation you
[54:51] found out that it always come back to
[54:52] Jesus
[54:54] are you following me Jesus hallelujah
[54:56] praise the Lord I am he that was dead
[54:58] and now at least that's what Revelation
[55:00] did in the first chapter
[55:02] I am he that was dead and now lives
[55:04] that has to be Jesus isn't it he said
[55:07] see God the Father did not die
[55:09] praise the Lord he can't kill the spirit
[55:11] like that right
[55:13] God the Holy Ghost did not die do they
[55:15] put it right but God
[55:18] the Eternal God came to your body and he
[55:21] hung up under the cross Hallelujah so
[55:24] that boy can die for our sin that body
[55:25] and then he returned around and I'm back
[55:28] back now in Revelation said I am
[55:31] Hallelujah so when Moses
[55:34] came out uh came you know he comes every
[55:38] time out into the Into the Wilderness to
[55:40] Tender his father-in-law jitro's sheep
[55:42] and things
[55:43] and you know remember the story when
[55:46] Moses was only living in Egypt
[55:49] with he was not giving a rod
[55:51] like we're watching now Sister the
[55:53] military said in in Ten Commandments
[55:55] that ain't true that's a lie
[55:58] that's right he showed that the the
[56:00] Pharaoh Ramsey whatever his name was
[56:03] gave Moses a rod and send in the
[56:06] wilderness that's a lie Robin and Cecil
[56:09] well we saw what happened was most
[56:11] remember the story Moses went to the
[56:14] camp of the Jew Israelites one day and
[56:16] he saw an Egyptian doing something wrong
[56:19] to an Israelite and he went to defend
[56:21] the Israelites and they killed that guy
[56:24] that that Egyptian
[56:26] are you following me and he came by the
[56:28] following day and here he saw two
[56:31] Israelites fighting Brothers I said
[56:33] Brothers what's wrong with you man you
[56:35] guys are brothers when you find one
[56:37] another you brothers and the one that
[56:39] was wrong said who you who are you
[56:41] talking to do you want to cut cumula you
[56:44] killed the Egyptian yesterday yeah and
[56:46] Musa wow so everybody know they know
[56:48] about my secret now oh they know what I
[56:50] did and that's why Moses ran away from
[56:52] the Egypt from that place not not in the
[56:56] Lord and a bottle of water bottle and
[56:58] said man now that's allowed the devil
[57:00] yeah
[57:01] and Moses went into that land of the
[57:05] midianites and he met with Jethro and
[57:07] Jethro hired him and whatever and he
[57:10] married his daughters and everything and
[57:12] and every day the the deal in the
[57:14] contract is that every day he gonna take
[57:16] his the the rod the street that Moses
[57:19] had he got it right in midianite
[57:22] and they took that road and they tender
[57:24] the flock every day and it goes every
[57:26] day like that and bring the ship back to
[57:27] the house but this particular day was
[57:28] different
[57:29] and he was turning the floor up with the
[57:31] weight and uh they let the ship start
[57:34] going and gracing and eating you know
[57:36] and he just sat down there
[57:38] all of a sudden he has a sound and
[57:41] turned around he looked right on the
[57:43] right there in the desert in the
[57:44] wilderness there ran a little pass out
[57:46] of the hill and saw a fire burning
[57:49] and well that's not maybe somebody was
[57:51] there working it though you know he
[57:52] didn't pay any attention they look back
[57:54] again therefore I still burning he
[57:56] looked back again therefore I didn't
[57:57] burn it but an extreme part of it the
[58:00] leaves were not being consumed
[58:02] he said this is strange and Moses stood
[58:05] up I mean go step aside and see what is
[58:09] going on this this is strange and that's
[58:11] not just making the first step a voice
[58:13] performed that fire said Moses Moses
[58:17] right take half thy shoes
[58:20] for the ground that which thou stands
[58:22] the Holy Ground I mean to speak I am the
[58:24] god of your father Abraham Isaac and
[58:28] Jacob but they did what I've done put it
[58:31] across tonight before I go to the main
[58:32] part of this message is this that the
[58:35] Bush was not burning
[58:37] even though the fire was you know going
[58:39] like that
[58:40] well that means it's not the kind of
[58:42] fire that we have today
[58:43] right it's a different kind of Fire it
[58:46] means it's a kind of fire that doesn't
[58:47] need oxygen to burn
[58:49] because the leaves were not being
[58:51] consumed it's a supernatural father fire
[58:53] what it was it was the pillar of Fire
[58:56] that came down there to cause attraction
[58:59] so it can commission His prophets
[59:08] you know a manifestation a presence to
[59:12] the prophet so it can fellowship with
[59:14] him now that's what the Bible said the
[59:16] pillar of fires the Holy Ghost
[59:18] hallelujah praise be to God so all right
[59:21] so Moses was commissioned there that day
[59:22] and we remember the whole rest of the
[59:24] story do I wonder I don't want to take
[59:25] time tonight and Moses went he went back
[59:27] to Egypt and to take Israel out and
[59:29] everything and and we know all the
[59:31] plagues and whatever all the power that
[59:32] that all the supernatural thing that
[59:34] took place there but Mrs when Moses took
[59:36] Israel out of Egypt
[59:38] and they came to the Red Sea when Israel
[59:41] looked back
[59:42] they saw the host of Egyptians right
[59:45] behind them closing on them oh my God
[59:48] and right to their left hand is a
[59:50] mountain to their right is the mountain
[59:52] nowhere to fled and right in front of
[59:55] them they were blocked by the Red Sea
[59:57] and the Bible said but we need to cry oh
[1:00:00] Moses oh most what have you done to us
[1:00:03] Moses she's like why don't you leave us
[1:00:06] in Egypt where we can have a great where
[1:00:08] we can bury us and whatever more what
[1:00:09] have you done through us and they cried
[1:00:11] and when they cried the Bible said Moses
[1:00:13] cry also unto God
[1:00:15] when people were crying God did not say
[1:00:18] one word but they don't know who he was
[1:00:20] but when Moses cried then God spoke and
[1:00:23] God said Moses why cry
[1:00:26] speak the word hallelujah what do you
[1:00:28] have in your hands the rod and Moses
[1:00:30] took the rod and he lived on the Red Sea
[1:00:33] and the Bible said that that night is
[1:00:36] strong wind came and stopped the racing
[1:00:38] from flowing and that that that that
[1:00:40] what I keep patting up about 19 feet
[1:00:42] high
[1:00:43] Hallelujah but here's what the good
[1:00:46] thing about it before the rest he parted
[1:00:48] what is Egypt was closing up on Israel
[1:00:51] that pillar came down
[1:00:53] praise the Lord you become a bigger
[1:00:56] bigger street light for Israel that they
[1:00:58] can see but on the other side of Israel
[1:01:00] before Egyptian is a student blackout
[1:01:02] right
[1:01:03] so that Egypt cannot see through to see
[1:01:06] the Israelites and they stopped
[1:01:09] Hallelujah so why does why the blackouts
[1:01:12] stop them the pillar of fire became a
[1:01:14] light for the Israelites and the Red Sea
[1:01:16] parted and they walk across the Red Sea
[1:01:18] and that's not a client to the bank of
[1:01:20] the rest on the left side the pillar
[1:01:22] fire moved to the Israel side
[1:01:24] Hallelujah and then God removed that
[1:01:27] Blackness then Egyptians can now see oh
[1:01:30] they went through the rest we're gonna
[1:01:31] do the same thing and you know the rest
[1:01:33] of the story they came through and the
[1:01:34] water cover them and they perish in the
[1:01:35] rest
[1:01:37] but but he that's where I'm going
[1:01:39] tonight and since that that was the
[1:01:41] first time that Israel will see the
[1:01:43] pillar of fire praise the Lord and and
[1:01:46] um
[1:01:49] if you notice in in Nehemiah chapter 9
[1:01:51] Brothers feet at the back they feel
[1:01:52] Nehemiah chapter 9 verse 12 to 19.
[1:01:57] it's explained how that during the day
[1:01:59] the pillar of fire became a cloud right
[1:02:02] but at night it was a pillar of Fire
[1:02:05] but the same money presence of the
[1:02:07] almighty God are you with me because I
[1:02:10] stayed with Israel for 40 years in the
[1:02:12] wilderness on the Arabic Promised Land I
[1:02:14] want to read the Nehemiah we have your
[1:02:16] Bible record Nehemiah Nehemiah chapter
[1:02:18] 12 chapter 9 verses 12 and verses 19. he
[1:02:22] said moreover thou letters them in the
[1:02:25] day by a cloudy pillar and in the Night
[1:02:28] by a pillar of Fire
[1:02:30] to give them light so it was a street
[1:02:32] life for them to give them light in the
[1:02:35] way wherein they should go now go to
[1:02:38] verse 18 of the same chapter say yeah
[1:02:40] when they had made them a molten calf
[1:02:42] after the the Moses got the Ten
[1:02:44] Commandments and then they saw him you
[1:02:46] know they made a molting cave and said
[1:02:47] this is thy God that brought it out of
[1:02:49] up out of Egypt and had wrought great
[1:02:51] provocations made God mad yet
[1:02:55] thou in thy manifold mercies for Success
[1:02:58] them not in the wilderness
[1:03:01] the pillar of the cloud departed now
[1:03:03] from them by day to lead them the way
[1:03:06] neither the pillar of Fire by night to
[1:03:09] show them lights and the way we are in
[1:03:12] they shall go
[1:03:15] that Pillar of Fire became part of
[1:03:17] Israel's Journey
[1:03:18] and there's a good part of it right from
[1:03:21] the open of the Red Sea another pillar
[1:03:23] for having to lead them the news spread
[1:03:25] around like fire all those countries on
[1:03:27] the way the amalekites the jebo side the
[1:03:30] parasite the Philistine they were scared
[1:03:33] to death of Israel even when people of
[1:03:35] Jericho heard about Israel they were so
[1:03:37] scared to death they said there's a God
[1:03:40] among them who works with them in the
[1:03:42] pillar of fire and they were scared to
[1:03:44] death are you following me today and
[1:03:46] they stay with them until they arrive in
[1:03:48] the promised land and Joshua divided
[1:03:49] portion
[1:03:51] the next time that we will
[1:03:53] um well the next time Israel will hear
[1:03:55] about the city plural fire again and and
[1:03:57] hear his voice was in in Exodus the 19
[1:04:00] chapter verse 3 when Moses was called up
[1:04:03] to the mountain by God
[1:04:05] to receive the Commandments remember and
[1:04:08] when was it because God said he wanted
[1:04:09] to talk to the people himself remember
[1:04:11] but around says when Lord came down the
[1:04:13] pillar of Fire on the Mountain and I
[1:04:15] want to talk to the people he said
[1:04:16] because of the powerful manifestation
[1:04:18] around the area the fire burning the
[1:04:20] wind blowing the animals from the Helter
[1:04:22] Skelter Israel could not stand all those
[1:04:24] thunderings and all the Lightnings and
[1:04:27] the Thomas the Moses you go ahead and
[1:04:30] talk to that God and come tell us what
[1:04:32] he says they were afraid to talk to God
[1:04:35] now but once that's why from that time
[1:04:37] on God decided to send His prophets to
[1:04:40] the people but okay we come back for the
[1:04:44] next 40 years the pillar of fire was
[1:04:46] with Israel now okay the nest I will
[1:04:49] hear about the pillar of fire
[1:04:50] manifestation after Sunrise
[1:04:52] manifestation was when Solomon was
[1:04:55] dedicating the temple
[1:04:57] and now the Bible told us when Solomon
[1:04:59] uh was beginning to empty Temple and he
[1:05:01] prayed to the Lord and asked God to come
[1:05:03] down bless your people whenever whenever
[1:05:04] they're in trouble somewhere and they
[1:05:06] turned into the 12th direction of this
[1:05:08] Temple you hear from Heaven a lot of
[1:05:10] stuff like that and the Bible said that
[1:05:11] the the Cloudy pillar came down
[1:05:14] declarative presence came down there to
[1:05:16] the point that the glory was so heavy
[1:05:18] that the priest could not Minister
[1:05:21] because of that presence that even the
[1:05:24] priests had to walk outside isn't the
[1:05:26] Bible there right there the simpler fire
[1:05:29] the simple in the day is a pillar in the
[1:05:31] cloud in the night it's a fire burning
[1:05:34] fire Lively fire are you fully with me
[1:05:36] today that's in First Kings chapter 8
[1:05:38] verse 10. all right the next time we're
[1:05:41] here by the player fire again was when
[1:05:44] Jesus you know during his ministry
[1:05:46] towards the end of his ministry during
[1:05:48] his adoption at Mount transguration
[1:05:51] and the Bible said Jesus went to the man
[1:05:53] with Peter James and John remember the
[1:05:55] story and while the others said that the
[1:05:57] cloud came down remember that cloud
[1:05:58] that's the presence of the almighty God
[1:06:00] there
[1:06:01] and him said the almighty God the
[1:06:04] presence came they had to to vindicate
[1:06:06] who he was and they saw Moses and Elijah
[1:06:09] talking to him about his death burial
[1:06:12] and resurrection and Peter said oh my
[1:06:15] lord it's good to be here but remember I
[1:06:18] want to start a denomination he said oh
[1:06:20] it's good to be here if he pleases you
[1:06:22] Lord let's build a tabernacle for one
[1:06:24] for Moses one for Elijah and one from
[1:06:26] you for one for you but but that's not
[1:06:30] what God was intending for that
[1:06:31] Supernatural manifestation he said a
[1:06:34] voice came through that clarifier and
[1:06:37] said this is my beloved Son hear ye him
[1:06:40] don't build no other organization don't
[1:06:43] build no denomination the pillar of
[1:06:45] proud right there to vindicate the
[1:06:48] presence of the Lord Jesus of God of
[1:06:50] heaven and flesh
[1:06:52] and we did not hear about that Pillar of
[1:06:54] Fire of Love Cloud again until Acts
[1:06:57] chapter 9 verses 1 to 22. when that one
[1:07:00] whole stubborn hard-headed try to see
[1:07:04] man Call Saul of Tassels
[1:07:07] was on his way to semester to Damascus
[1:07:09] to arrest the Believers and while he was
[1:07:13] going there it was almost on Damascus
[1:07:16] he saw a light from Heaven come on
[1:07:18] come on that cloud can die again but
[1:07:21] being a scholar he knew what I was but
[1:07:24] because we don't know what that was he
[1:07:26] would not call it Lord
[1:07:27] when that president came down and the
[1:07:29] voice came from that that cloud cloudy
[1:07:32] flight and said Saul Saul why persecuted
[1:07:36] down me and Saul said who are thou Lord
[1:07:39] right and guess what he said now say I
[1:07:42] am Jesus he ain't no more The Jewel of
[1:07:45] the Old Testament he's not Jesus now he
[1:07:47] has a human name a Redemptive name I am
[1:07:50] Jesus whom thou persecuted it's a hard
[1:07:53] thing for thee to kick against the
[1:07:54] priests and and the people thought oh my
[1:07:58] God what shall I do now and you know the
[1:08:00] rest of the story he went to ananias and
[1:08:01] whatever and and and he was saved and he
[1:08:03] went to the ministry one of the best the
[1:08:05] greatest airports of the of Ages and we
[1:08:07] did not hear about the pillar of Fire or
[1:08:10] the
[1:08:10] of them well so I I I I jumped I jumped
[1:08:13] something I had to come back right quick
[1:08:15] right yeah Pentacles excuse me
[1:08:18] right back remember they are Pentecost
[1:08:21] on their Pentecost the pillar came down
[1:08:24] after that Transfiguration experience
[1:08:26] the Philadelphia came down the Bible
[1:08:28] said when the day off I'm going to read
[1:08:29] that directly before before we close
[1:08:31] tonight the Bible said when the
[1:08:32] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[1:08:35] together in one Accord I like that word
[1:08:38] one Accord because that's what the
[1:08:40] Church of the Living God needs God works
[1:08:42] in unity God does not like division
[1:08:46] people of God that's what we always said
[1:08:48] we will stay with your pastor God
[1:08:50] Reverend told that guy in Arizona says
[1:08:51] stay with your pastor and God will work
[1:08:54] Miracle among you
[1:08:55] still it's not because the Brazil is
[1:08:58] there because he's a friend or I know
[1:08:59] him stay with your pastor people that's
[1:09:01] God's order that's God ordination that's
[1:09:04] the word of God save your pastor because
[1:09:06] that means protection right are you
[1:09:08] following me today the all kind of
[1:09:10] demons flying around today in the
[1:09:11] message
[1:09:12] and they were all one Accord and when
[1:09:14] it's in verse chapter two of Acts verse
[1:09:16] 1 7 when a day of Pentecost was fully
[1:09:17] come they were all with one Accord in
[1:09:19] one place
[1:09:20] and suddenly there came a son from
[1:09:22] Heaven as of a Russian Mighty Wind and
[1:09:24] if you love the house where they were
[1:09:26] sitting and they appeared to them
[1:09:28] clothing tongues like us of Fire
[1:09:31] but if I said I'm already quote by
[1:09:33] around saying it was that same pillar
[1:09:34] right I came down there that this they
[1:09:36] were praying that was 10 days after his
[1:09:39] Ascension and that pillar felt like a
[1:09:41] ball came down the room where they are
[1:09:42] and in John Mark's house in the upper
[1:09:44] room and when that build up that ball of
[1:09:46] fire came to the room he said this time
[1:09:48] if this Sunday has never done before
[1:09:49] before he divides that severally as
[1:09:52] clothing tons of fire and rest on each
[1:09:55] of every other disciples right in the
[1:09:57] room each of them became a part of the
[1:09:59] pillar of fire hallelujah praise God and
[1:10:03] then the next time we've ever heard
[1:10:04] about the pillar of fire is is where we
[1:10:07] just couldn't join in Acts chapter 9
[1:10:09] during the time when Paul was on due to
[1:10:11] Damascus okay now we didn't hear about
[1:10:14] the people of Friday more since then
[1:10:15] since that Damascus Road experience the
[1:10:18] next time by the way that we heard about
[1:10:19] Pillar of Fire was in 1909
[1:10:23] in 1909
[1:10:25] a little boy was born
[1:10:28] in a little cabin here in this country
[1:10:31] not in Nigeria where I come from nothing
[1:10:34] no nothing not in Europe not in South
[1:10:36] America here in America
[1:10:39] a little boy was born
[1:10:41] and that little cabin in Kentucky
[1:10:46] and while he was laying the crib that
[1:10:48] day
[1:10:49] as long as the the the testimony in my
[1:10:52] life story
[1:10:53] it like him from the heavens
[1:10:56] that's in pillar of light came from the
[1:10:58] heavens during the day and the real
[1:11:00] daylight entered through the shadow of
[1:11:02] the window
[1:11:03] and enveloped that boy in the crib in
[1:11:06] the room
[1:11:07] and these parents were now religious
[1:11:09] people
[1:11:10] and everybody in the neighborhood coming
[1:11:12] to see what manner of a Child is This
[1:11:14] and That Was the baby Branham William
[1:11:16] Branham and that pillar fire enveloped
[1:11:20] him showing that he was not just an
[1:11:22] ordinary baby
[1:11:23] he was a problem he was born a prophet
[1:11:25] of God William Brown said you don't go
[1:11:28] to school to be a prophet a prophet is
[1:11:30] brown a prophet
[1:11:32] and I I I pray that people that have
[1:11:34] followed this message will realize what
[1:11:36] they are doing by trying to discredit
[1:11:38] William Branham or say knock on a manner
[1:11:40] of foolishness against this message or
[1:11:43] the supernatural Vindication that follow
[1:11:44] this message
[1:11:46] in every age whenever God said a prophet
[1:11:48] to that one word of that messenger a
[1:11:51] prophet is total Annihilation from God
[1:11:54] it to that cut out
[1:11:57] blasphemy of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:00] and I'm feeling unforgiving sin
[1:12:01] unforgivable sin you know and and that
[1:12:04] that like cover that boy and uh and then
[1:12:07] we know with the rest of the story I
[1:12:08] don't want to waste time because of our
[1:12:09] time and I'm going to close very shortly
[1:12:10] on that
[1:12:12] and and then when it was uh liberal
[1:12:14] grown about seven or nine years old he
[1:12:17] himself told my life story another ninja
[1:12:19] came to me I was going to fetch Water
[1:12:21] Somewhere someday and that angel that
[1:12:23] came that light that symmetal of Lord
[1:12:24] the Lord himself he wasn't spoken
[1:12:27] through the dark popular tree
[1:12:28] and said do not smoke or drink or defile
[1:12:33] your body in any way for when you die
[1:12:35] when you grow older I got a job for you
[1:12:37] yeah
[1:12:38] are you following me but okay well it
[1:12:41] came it happened it wasn't Baptist
[1:12:42] Church it was a preacher I think of the
[1:12:43] Bible and in 1933 in Ohio River
[1:12:47] he was baptizing some converts
[1:12:49] and then when when it was but that's in
[1:12:51] the 17th person
[1:12:59] uh James Humes took me there many years
[1:13:03] ago he said that light started coming
[1:13:05] from the old bridge you know the old
[1:13:07] wooden bridge of across Ohio that light
[1:13:10] that pillar flight deploy fire came down
[1:13:12] there and walked his way slowly and
[1:13:15] people saw it moving at the lower range
[1:13:18] and was moving all the way coming all
[1:13:21] the way until they come to wherever I
[1:13:23] was stand the river and hung on his head
[1:13:26] right the pillar of fire people
[1:13:30] and a voice from that Pillar of Fire

[1:19:46] sister Silas say complaining weakens
[1:19:48] your faith
[1:19:49] yes that's what he said
[1:19:51] he said and they were complaining about
[1:19:53] it they are left they boasting position
[1:19:54] of Egypt to be with the great physician
[1:19:56] and was complaining about it they let a
[1:19:58] bunch of people that believed the days
[1:20:00] of Miracles were passed to be with a
[1:20:02] bunch of people that believe that all
[1:20:05] things were possible and still complain

[1:33:58] internet or not
[1:34:00] I'm telling the truth man actually I
[1:34:02] don't fear nobody now I only fear him
[1:34:05] I'm going to Nigeria tomorrow anyways
[1:34:11] if you go around your pastel how's it
[1:34:14] going to be able to do anything good for
[1:34:15] you right you have to respect a man
[1:34:17] before his gift can work for you exactly
[1:34:20] are you with me today even the
[1:34:22] medication they give in the hospital
[1:34:23] those couplets and vitamins if you don't
[1:34:26] the drug the Frozen doctor will make you
[1:34:27] do is to have faith he's gonna work for
[1:34:29] you first because oh you're gonna be all
[1:34:31] right you're gonna be all right just
[1:34:32] take this I say oh and you believe that
[1:34:33] that's how simple it is
[1:34:35] you have to believe in the in the man of
[1:34:38] God if I can help you you have to
[1:34:40] believe you don't run down his wife you
[1:34:43] don't look he's you know it's not easy
[1:34:44] to be a preacher people
[1:34:46] it's hard to be a pastor because when
[1:34:49] you all make a mistake check members
[1:34:51] guess who you run to the pastor and we
[1:34:53] pray for you but when we made mistakes
[1:34:55] or our wives or our children who are we
[1:34:57] gonna run to yeah
[1:34:59] we have to cry in the house and say Lord
[1:35:01] help us and then you order the champion
[1:35:02] to criticize the past that's why see
[1:35:04] what she did see the pastor because the
[1:35:06] pastor's family is on a high platform
[1:35:08] see anybody can see it's their mistake
[1:35:10] very easily
[1:35:12] but whereas there are millions and
[1:35:13] millions worst mistakes being committed
[1:35:15] right in the church as The Sinner right
[1:35:17] and the people and nobody said nothing
[1:35:18] about it
[1:35:19] people look we need the grace of God in
[1:35:21] our lives we need the Holy Ghost we need
[1:35:24] that caption of the pyramid charity to
[1:35:27] cap our life Hallelujah so you can be

[1:36:54] when you ask God for a blessing in the
[1:36:56] message where I think Pentecost failed
[1:36:58] he said don't ask God for little little
[1:37:00] things

[1:37:40] receive as small things
[1:37:44] see when you have that faith and you
[1:37:46] know how to use it you say you're going
[1:37:48] to be all right
