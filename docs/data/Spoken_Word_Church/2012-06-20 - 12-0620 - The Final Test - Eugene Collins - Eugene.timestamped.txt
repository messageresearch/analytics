[24:26] Christ right you know I mean back down
[24:29] greatest battle that brother Brown was
[24:31] preaching on I used to I listen to a lot
[24:34] and read it a lot but find out that what
[24:36] he was doing is showing that the the
[24:39] battle is your mind against your soul we
[24:42] in the mind age right now we Inc of age
[24:46] exactly man you don't go to school now
[24:48] to learn how to plow a mule or how to
[24:51] mil your count more do you brother dick
[24:54] can go there today to learn how to you
[24:56] know create something I mean something
[24:59] powerful something right and you know
[25:01] how the school today just like I hear
[25:04] them speaking here a while back how did
[25:06] they want to give more education I want
[25:08] to give more money to the education
[25:10] programs to you know to educate our
[25:14] younger people more yeah I said what in
[25:16] the world is this coming to man they
[25:19] done got so far now you don't know I
[25:22] talked to some up in the I was up at a
[25:24] campground here a few weeks ago done
[25:26] some work at a different church and
[25:29] listen at the people talk and the
[25:31] programs they got and the things they
[25:33] are doing for religious you know matters
[25:35] and and trying to get to heaven with it
[25:38] brother they trying their best to break
[25:40] into something exactly but you know what
[25:43] you they going at it the wrong
[25:45] way you know the Simplicity of the word
[25:48] of God is how you get into it am but we
[25:51] can learn to Humble ourselves in the
[25:53] presence of God and and get to a place
[25:56] that we'll humble ourselves in the
[25:57] presence of his word you know if you
[26:00] want to really get close to God just get
[26:02] close to his
[26:04] word amen I know a lot of people try
[26:06] still fast and they try to do all these
[26:09] things to get close to God but I found
[26:11] that that don't work too good it help
[26:13] you get yourself out of the way but the
[26:15] way that you really want to get close to
[26:17] God is to get your mind anchored in this
[26:20] word amen amen I used to hear Brother
[26:23] Brown how start off and listen to him he
[26:27] I used to think boy sure couldn't sing
[26:29] too good he you know a little old voice
[26:32] he just but boy when you listen to it a
[26:35] little while you hear he to singing to
[26:38] something besides the
[26:39] world right he's breaking in on
[26:42] something you know right and that's the
[26:44] same way in his ministry he he' tell
[26:47] people one time he said I might not know
[26:49] all about the things and religion and
[26:52] about Bible about a lot of things but he
[26:55] said I do know one thing I know the
[26:56] author of this
[26:59] Hallelujah we break through and get to a
[27:01] place that we know who controls this
[27:04] word amen who the word what the word
[27:07] really is to that's right brother and
[27:09] sister it'll produce life amen it brings
[27:12] forth something inside of us a mind of
[27:15] God a place in God that you've never you
[27:18] know I tell my wife this morning I said
[27:20] you know if reason back
[27:22] young how to in days of Samson the days
[27:25] of David they had to have strength yeah
[27:28] you know but they got it from uh to
[27:30] fight battles back there with yeah right
[27:34] Joshua's day and all them uh great
[27:37] Servants of God the prophets of God they
[27:40] had to have strength and I was thinking
[27:42] about uh uh Gideon how did God start him
[27:46] off the fight of bam right how he
[27:49] started off with about 20,000 soldiers y
[27:52] finally got down to about
[27:54] 10,000 then finally God said said I got
[27:57] to put you through another test amen y
[28:01] you know I guess Gideon was kind of
[28:03] thinking what's going on what's
[28:05] Happening Here yeah man it looks like
[28:07] I'm going to God's going to cause me to
[28:09] lose the battle Yeah but God had to have
[28:12] it place to where he could uh put his
[28:15] confidence and something he had to place
[28:18] his power in and place his glory in it
[28:21] he had to have something that he know
[28:23] that was real praise the Lord right amen
[28:26] and I told my wife I said if God give us
[28:28] the power like he did that Fells back
[28:30] there in the Bible I said we'd be
[28:32] killing one another
[28:34] today man we' just speaking death upon
[28:36] one another they want nobody hard to be
[28:39] alive
[28:40] today I said because we get our feelings
[28:43] hurt we get all scrambled up sometimes
[28:46] and a pastor sometimes has to kind of
[28:49] correct us a little bit while we just
[28:50] get shut of him boy yeah yeah I mean if
[28:53] we had the power you know that went got
[28:55] back ter but God would give giving us
[28:57] something today he's kinding to release
[28:59] his right you know that's what God's
[29:02] been doing but he's doing it in it's
[29:05] time and a place and I heard brother W
[29:07] down there preaching on adoption at the
[29:09] church and man I got to hear him how he
[29:12] was talking about God's getting his
[29:14] little bride in the placing in the place
[29:16] he needs to be before he can trust her
[29:18] amen with his power and His glory that's
[29:21] right and that's what God's doing he
[29:23] ain't going to just turn it loose till
[29:25] you know till we get to a place he can
[29:26] control it in amen we got to learn how
[29:28] to control this
[29:30] power David learned how to kill them
[29:32] bars and things that there on the back
[29:35] side of the desert watching over his
[29:37] father sheep and stuff he learned what
[29:39] Str me there boy when he come out
[29:42] against the devil and against the powers
[29:44] and the old giant that kind that had the
[29:47] army of God fooled and scared to death

[51:24] about Elijah never did finish it Elisha
[51:27] you know when El Elisha started putting
[51:29] that manle on and sat there in the field
[51:31] when old Elijah went by and he said
[51:33] there plowing his Ox amen and plowing
[51:36] his old uh fields and Elijah went by and
[51:40] kind of struck him with a metal yeah
[51:42] right left him something to think about
[51:44] didn't right I tell you what it got his
[51:47] attention praise God he began to get his
[51:50] old horses or whatever he applying his
[51:53] cows or uh and began to te his plows up
[51:57] and leave them in the field and he said
[52:00] I'm going to follow that man he's got
[52:02] something I need right right you know
[52:04] that's the way I was about the message
[52:06] praise God the first time I heard it I
[52:09] know there's something about it when I
[52:10] hear it the anointed ones at the end
[52:12] time that's a hard message you get a
[52:14] hold of the first time I'm tell you cuz
[52:16] I was at there amongst the anointed ones
[52:18] right but we a shou and hollering and
[52:21] prophesying and speaking in tongues and
[52:23] just living any kind of way yeah I mean
[52:26] I was doing but I know these Fellers was
[52:29] some of them as monks had anointing on
[52:32] them buddy I tell you what when I hear
[52:34] that message thank God there's something
[52:36] in my mind and my spirit caught my
[52:38] attention amen that's the same Elijah
[52:41] that passed Elisha there field praise
[52:44] God right no Elija said listen I'm going
[52:46] to follow you man yeah let me just get
[52:49] sh on my old plow and things here you
[52:51] know he had a lot of hindrance didn't he
[52:53] yeah but he kept his eyes light on that
[52:55] Prophet praise God brother he kept on
[52:59] going and you know there some of the
[53:02] prophets come down there those uh Fells
[53:05] and begin to tell him you know say hey
[53:07] don't you know your service's going to
[53:08] be taken away don't you know your master
[53:10] is going to leave you he said well it
[53:12] don't make any difference amen that's
[53:14] right he said it don't matter he said
[53:16] I'm going to follow him anyway it's my
[53:19] soul lives praise God as God lives he
[53:22] said I'm that's one I'm going to follow
[53:24] amen something about him amen that I
[53:26] need praise the Lord hallelujah what was
[53:30] it it wasn't Elijah it was a spirit was
[53:33] thank God he kept on and finally Elijah
[53:35] seen this man he ain't going stop don't
[53:38] look like he finally told him he said
[53:39] hey I I'm going to have to go over here
[53:41] to place you stay right here and just
[53:44] wait and you know I'm going to be taken
[53:46] away after a while Elisha said hey said
[53:49] I ain't going to let this stop right I'm
[53:51] going where you praise God that's the
[53:54] way I was with that message when I hear
[53:56] that anointed ones at the end time
[53:58] brother I started getting shut up my old
[54:00] ideas right I started leaving them
[54:03] praise God and began to put away things
[54:05] because of false baptism and all that
[54:08] stuff that I baptized in not knowing but
[54:11] you know when I recognize it wasn't
[54:13] right you know I better go on to
[54:15] something else praise God but I was
[54:18] brought up under that teaching you know
[54:21] and you know I guess if I hadn't know
[54:23] better I'd probably made it by but
[54:25] listen when God come by with that
[54:27] message right I knew then when he be to
[54:30] show us that was the only hope is to
[54:32] seeing that death and burial
[54:34] resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ
[54:36] through baptism Amen brother I said I've
[54:38] got to go through this and that big snow
