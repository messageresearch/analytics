[20:59] kids his grandkids and they we're there
[21:01] amen so let me read this to you it's
[21:03] called two
[21:05] viewpoints said Mike went to church one
[21:07] Sunday morning he ordered the organist
[21:09] miss a note during the Prelude and it
[21:11] bothered him
[21:12] immensely he observed two teenagers
[21:15] passing notes when everybody was
[21:17] supposed to be bowed in silent prayer he
[21:19] thought the Usher was watching to see
[21:21] what he put in the offering plate and
[21:23] irritated him he winced as he caught the
[21:26] pastor and six grammar eras during the
[21:29] course of the sermon in the closing hymn
[21:31] as the closing hymn was being sung he
[21:33] slipped out the side door and said what
[21:35] a waste of time what a weird assortment
[21:37] of Hypocrites and
[21:39] jerks Robert went to church one Sunday
[21:41] morning the organist played an
[21:43] arrangement of Wesley's love divine and
[21:45] he thrilled to the beauty and
[21:46] inspiration of it he listened
[21:48] attentively as a Young Man shared with
[21:50] the congregation the difference Jesus
[21:52] Christ made in his life he was happy to
[21:55] see his church take a special offering
[21:57] for people made homeless by a terrible
[21:59] flood and felt a sense of fulfillment to
[22:01] give over and above his tithe it
[22:04] especially appreciate the morning
[22:05] message it gave him the strength he
[22:07] needed to face a new week his heart beat
[22:10] with joy as he saw a young man respond
[22:12] to the invitation following the sermon
[22:14] and commit his life to Christ he felt
[22:16] the warmth and fellowship of God's
[22:18] people at worship and as he walked out
[22:21] the doors of the church his cup was
[22:23] overflowing and he thought how can a
[22:25] person worship here not feel his holy
[22:28] and divine presence interesting thing is
[22:31] both of these men went to the same
[22:33] church on the same Sunday morning but
[22:35] each man found exactly what he was
[22:38] looking for your church has much to
[22:40] offer each week why not come and search
[22:42] for the right thing each week as you
[22:45] worship I thought that was real good
[22:48] ameny we got to come and we got to
[22:50] expect to receive something from God the
[22:53] prophet of God said you get what you
[22:54] expect amen so I come tonight expecting
[22:57] are this afternoon expecting to see more
[22:59] of God Amen expecting him to just do the
[23:03] impossible amen cuz all things are
[23:06] possible to them that believe amen I
[23:09] appreciate that let's stand together
[23:11] again tonight
[23:13] amen amen he has a lot to offer amen
[23:16] it's just like this somebody said well
[23:18] ma is listen t one man said my he called
[23:20] me a buzzard he said that's something he

[23:23] eagle amen depends on what you're
[23:26] looking for he am man you say well if
[23:28] you're looking for a Hollywood
[23:30] Showmanship you come to the wrong
[23:32] place Jesus even told them about John

[26:36] like to take little for a thought maybe
[26:38] try not to hold you too long Walking
[26:42] with God Amen Walking with God and Lord
[26:47] as we start here I was thinking along
[26:50] the lines you know here we are and uh uh
[26:53] I was thinking here in and we read in
[26:55] Genesis and it said but Noah found Grace
[26:58] in the eyes of the Lord and and and and
[27:00] Noah was a a righteousness preacher
[27:03] preached 120 years and had the same
[27:06] message that it was going to rain
[27:08] because we know what the the the story
[27:10] entails about how that God got tired of
[27:14] uh uh uh uh what the men were doing what
[27:17] the women were doing just seeing
[27:19] everywhere and all this and their their
[27:22] very thoughts were evil and everything
[27:24] and and so but but Noah the Bible says
[27:27] found Grace in his sight amen that's
[27:30] what I want to do and I hope I trust
[27:31] that I do and I hope each and every one
[27:33] of us do this afternoon is find Grace in
[27:36] the sight of the Lord amen I might not
[27:39] find favor and Grace in your side but if
[27:41] I can find favor and Grace in The Lord's
[27:43] Side that's what I
[27:46] want and so we see here that Noah said
[27:49] he would said these are the generations
[27:51] of Noah Noah was a just man and perfect
[27:54] in his Generations I think that's you
[27:57] said well how can that be I think that's
[27:58] what God was talking his thoughts about
[28:01] Noah amen hey our thoughts hey we make
[28:04] mistakes we've done this but our
[28:05] thoughts in his mind were perfect I like
[28:09] that
[28:09] amen outside of him we're nothing but
[28:12] with him we're everything with him we're
[28:15] perfect this
[28:17] afternoon Hallelujah and so I think
[28:20] about Noah and I think about all this
[28:22] and I think about the way the world was
[28:24] going brother the Lord over there in the
[28:27] scripture when Jes was said as it was in
[28:29] the days of Noah they were married
[28:30] giving in marriage they planted they
[28:33] built and all that you never seen the
[28:35] likes of it today the building going on
[28:37] all this going on it's a it's a repeat
[28:40] of of back then and he said as it was
[28:43] when the in the days of when the son of
[28:45] man shall be
[28:46] revealed I thought about Noah you know
[28:49] here he was and all that how that he
[28:52] started now I I I I we're fixing to go
[28:54] somewhere to Branson here next weekend
[28:57] and I I've heard about S and S maybe you
[28:59] have they got one I think up in
[29:01] Pennsylvania and they have different
[29:03] things we're going to go see Esther and
[29:05] all that but anyway my son-in-law had a
[29:08] deal had a video about
[29:11] Noah and I look I looked at it and I
[29:13] thought it was real good and here it was
[29:15] Noah living in a day where they said Hey
[29:18] listen was a scientific age you know and
[29:22] God had said hey I'm tired of the way
[29:24] the people are doing I'm going to I'm
[29:26] going to send uh I'm going to destroy a
[29:28] man upon the face of the Earth but you
[29:30] knowah said I here's what I want you to
[29:32] do build me an ark he said build me for
[29:34] the saving of your uh household so
[29:37] building so many inches wide so many
[29:39] inches tall so many you know wide tall
[29:42] and all that long and all that and how
[29:45] that he started building well in this
[29:47] film it depicted now whether Noah had a
[29:50] brother I don't know but how this story
[29:52] how it depicted that Noah had a brother
[29:55] and he came around he was talking to his
[29:56] brother blly brother yeah he said no
[29:59] what are you doing and he Noah be to
[30:02] testify to his brother tell him what he
[30:04] was doing said now you know we're be we
[30:06] were raised right we were taught right
[30:09] and we were taught the things of God and
[30:10] said now look how everybody has gotten
[30:13] away from the things that we've been
[30:14] taught isn't that about the way it is
[30:17] today amen and he begin to
[30:19] share with his brother and his brother
[30:22] said what about this he said well God
[30:24] spoke to
[30:25] me told me to build this both for the
[30:27] sav of my family yeah he said you really
[30:31] believe that Noah now Noah couldn't
[30:34] explain it but he said I believe it with
[30:37] all my heart amen and I I believe it
[30:40] with all my heart and so M how it went
[30:43] on and and dur that fil his his brother
[30:46] goes to the mayor of the city and said
[30:48] Hey listen what's your brother doing
[30:49] down there he said well he he claims
[30:52] that God spoke to him that God's going
[30:54] to send a flood he's the T away
[30:56] everybody's been acting he's TI God has
[30:59] TI of the way everybody's been doing and
[31:01] he's going to
[31:02] destroy man from upon the face of the
[31:04] Earth
[31:06] yeah he said you go down there and tell
[31:08] your brother if he don't join us he
[31:12] can't buy nothing else to be help him
[31:14] build that boat with tell him he's a
[31:17] fanatic tell him say hey I talked to
[31:20] these and we got scientific research we
[31:22] can shoot up there in the Stars we got
[31:23] instruments and surely there's no water
[31:25] up there what's he talking
[31:28] about and so maybe he went back hey just
[31:31] the way it is today amen people don't
[31:34] want to hey people think we're kind of
[31:35] crazy man followers and all this amen
[31:38] but hey if God's revealed it to us let
[31:40] us walk in the way that God has revealed
[31:43] to us amen and he went back and he told
[31:46] no and no said Hey listen I don't care
[31:48] all I know is God said it's going to
[31:50] rain amen and that's what I'm standing
[31:52] on is that God said it was going to rain
[31:55] and he kept preaching and amen and even
[31:57] to the time that Noah entered the Ark he
[31:59] was still preaching you know the story
[32:01] how they came and they thought he was
[32:03] crazy they thought Noah we can do this
[32:05] we can do this surely ain't going to
[32:06] rain and they kept on but till one day
[32:09] it was too late and I tell you brothers
[32:11] and sisters one of these days it's going
[32:13] to be too late for me and you so what we
[32:15] need to do we need to walk with God
[32:17] regardless of what anybody else says cuz
[32:20] one of these days it's going to be too
[32:23] late
[32:25] Hallelujah and so so let me just look
[32:29] now what I want to do for the next few
[32:32] minutes now is look at Enoch's walk with
[32:36] God and look and see and compare our
[32:39] walk because the prophet of God said
[32:41] Enoch was a type of the raptured
[32:43] church now let us look at Enoch's walk
[32:47] and see how he walked and I hope our
[32:49] walk is like his
[32:51] walk
[32:53] amen so the Bible says I believe what is
[32:57] meant by Enoch's walk I think his walk
[33:00] was pleasing to God if you look in
[33:03] Hebrews the 11th chapter the 5th and six
[33:05] verse it says by faith Enoch was
[33:08] translated right right that he should
[33:11] not see death and was not found because
[33:15] God had translated him for before his
[33:18] translation he had this testimony that
[33:21] he pleased God I wonder if we've got
[33:24] that testimony tonight amen that we our
[33:28] walk and our life pleases God that's
[33:32] what I want now I may not please brother
[33:34] uh uh wait I may not please brother
[33:37] Homer but I want to please God not
[33:40] saying that I would do anything to
[33:42] offend these brothers I love these
[33:44] brothers but my walk has got to please
[33:47] God if it don't please anybody else it's
[33:50] got to please
[33:52] God so Enoch I think he didn't care he
[33:57] just wanted to please God verse 6 says
[34:00] but without faith is impossible to
[34:03] please him now we find out that the
[34:05] prophet Ty teaches us that faith is a
[34:08] revelation amen a revelation of what God
[34:12] wants us to do in the hour that we're
[34:14] living in not only that but a revelation
[34:16] of how he wants us to live in the hour
[34:18] that we're living in not only that but a
[34:21] revelation of how our walk should please
[34:24] God said by faith
[34:28] a't amen but without
[34:31] faith it is impossible to please him for
[34:35] he that cometh to God must believe that
[34:37] he is we first come to God we must
[34:41] believe that God is God is what God Is A
[34:44] Healer God is a deliverer God is this
[34:48] amen he he God is our is our is our way
[34:51] maker he's our
[34:53] provider that's what he is said he that
[34:56] cometh to God must believe that he is
[34:59] that he can do the impossible that he
[35:01] can take my life he can take your life
[35:04] and change it totally
[35:06] around I've seen it do it
[35:09] before I've seen it I remember hey can I
[35:12] just share can I just be myself this
[35:15] afternoon amen I don't know if it's been
[35:18] told here or not but it what it somebody
[35:21] had told another brother and he called
[35:23] me up on the phone and said hey I seen
[35:24] your
[35:25] girlfriend
[35:27] now let me explain that to
[35:29] you amen there's a friend of mine by the
[35:33] name of Mike wheeler and I met him one
[35:35] day when I was living out in ellaa Texas
[35:39] and so we was going to church or or I
[35:42] was and trying to live right being a
[35:44] teenager you know how sometimes it's
[35:46] kind of hey we didn't have it as hard as
[35:48] some of these teenagers have it
[35:50] today hey you know I mean hey come on
[35:54] now you know but hey I I I I feel for
[35:57] you you know we we got all the hey y'all

[36:02] stuff and sometimes you don't see nobody
[36:04] you don't see them you know and all
[36:06] they're on is on this all the time they
[36:08] got real good thumbs and stuff you know
[36:10] and all that you know I think sometimes
[36:12] it's nonsense amen man and I I
[36:15] understand hey maybe there may not be
[36:17] nothing wrong and I'm just hey wrong
[36:19] with them things but hey somewhere along
[36:21] the line we got to put God first
[36:23] absolutely amen so anyway I begin to
[36:25] talk to him how I met he was walking
[36:27] down the street and I love football I
[36:31] that was my life I mean I could tell you
[36:33] all the things and everything and so I
[36:35] had a football in my hand and he would
[36:37] and I see him walking and I didn't know
[36:39] him from Adam and I threw that football
[36:41] on him and said here catch and he
[36:43] dropped it I said you
[36:46] dummy you can't catch that ball what's
[36:49] the matter with you and we got
[36:51] acquainted and we got to talk and I got
[36:53] to witnessing to him I just 15 16 years
[36:55] old about he about the same age and I
[36:58] just started talking to him witnessing
[37:00] to him you know and I tell him I said
[37:02] what would Jesus do he said I don't know
[37:04] I didn't Liv in Jesus's day and so one
[37:07] day he came to church brother Wade he
[37:09] had hair down to
[37:10] here and an elderly sister bless her
[37:13] heart she's in glory now thought it was
[37:17] my
[37:18] girlfriend and said David brought his
[37:20] girlfriend to church
[37:23] today I told Brother Homer that I ain't
[37:25] going to tell you what he said but
[37:27] anyway anyway so anyway he come and he
[37:30] go and he come I still witness to him
[37:32] and there was something about it brother
[37:34] Wade I couldn't he Amen brother I
[37:36] couldn't give up amen I just couldn't
[37:39] brother Bob I just couldn't give up I
[37:42] just talked to him a witness to
[37:44] him five years later I mean we friends I
[37:47] didn't do what he did sometimes he said
[37:49] hey why don't you come I said we we're
[37:51] going to church today he said Sunday he
[37:53] said yeah what say he what said what
[37:54] about Sunday afternoon I said well we
[37:56] going back to church chch Sunday
[37:57] afternoon man you know you couldn't
[37:59] believe that but I talked to him and and
[38:02] so one day we was riding down the road
[38:04] he said David I was driving the car he
[38:06] said David I got to get my life right
[38:08] with God I said well when are you going
[38:10] to do it he hit on the door and he said
[38:12] I'll promise you tomorrow I'll be in
[38:15] this was on a Saturday night he said I
[38:16] promise you tomorrow I'll be in church
[38:18] somewhere I may not be in your church
[38:20] but I'll be in church somewhere he came
[38:22] to church God got a hold of him amen he
[38:25] plays a guitar in the church every now
[38:27] and then he leads singing until this
[38:30] day God can do the
[38:34] impossible
[38:36] amen Oh we must believe that he is amen
[38:40] that he can do the impossible and that
[38:42] he's a rewarder of them that diligently
[38:45] seek him now I looked up that word
[38:49] diligently and it means an energetic
[38:51] application absolutely so that means
[38:55] that I'm going to put everything I got
[38:57] into serving God I'm going to put
[38:59] everything hey if I was younger and I
[39:02] and I did this on a Friday night or
[39:04] Saturday night go to a ball game or
[39:06] whatever I'd put everything I got into
[39:08] that ball game if I was a ball game
[39:10] fiend or whatever or a dance fi or
[39:12] whatever amen well what about coming to
[39:15] the house of God and putting everything
[39:17] you got into serving God into worshiping
[39:20] God Amen you don't have to wait for
[39:22] brother Wade you don't have to wait for
[39:23] the song ler but there should be
[39:25] something in your heart say God I love
[39:27] you God I appreciate
[39:29] you he's a rewarder of them that
[39:32] diligently seek
[39:35] Him H
[39:37] amen so I think that was what was meant
[39:42] by Enoch's walk it was
[39:45] pleasing no special deed there was no
[39:49] special gift but by faith right the
[39:52] Bible says amen amen another thing thing
[39:57] about Enoch's walk amen he realized in
[40:02] the divine presence of almighty God
[40:05] right now you can't walk or let me say
[40:09] it like this some of us I used to work
[40:11] on a public job brother Way D did just
[40:15] some of you and you know sometimes when
[40:18] you work in a public job especially if
[40:20] they don't go to the same church you do
[40:22] they're just you know and they may claim
[40:23] to be Christians and they may do be all
[40:26] sometimes you get you work every day
[40:28] with that person and sometimes you
[40:30] around that person more than you are
[40:32] with your own family
[40:34] working and so you get to know a little
[40:36] bit about
[40:37] them you know what turns them on and
[40:40] what turns them off you know what
[40:42] buttons to push and what buttons not to
[40:46] push so hey you know just cuz you can't
[40:50] I don't believe you can walk work with
[40:51] somebody or walk with somebody every day
[40:53] and not know a little bit about them
[40:56] well what about our walk with Christ
[40:59] amen Enoch the Bible says Enoch walked
[41:02] with God and I believe he realized in
[41:06] the divine presence amen every day there
[41:09] wasn't a day go by that he didn't walk
[41:11] with God and he didn't have fellowship
[41:13] and communion with god oh imagine he
[41:16] might have called him Papa God
[41:19] hallelujah and he he knew all Enoch knew
[41:22] about God and God knew about Enoch I
[41:25] think about that woman over in Memphis
[41:27] when brother bam said Annie won't you
[41:30] pray and when she knelt down and begin
[41:32] to pray my you know sheal with him
[41:34] before amen I hope that was with us
[41:37] tonight that our walk can be that way
[41:39] with God
[41:41] tonight amen that he knows so much about
[41:45] us amen hallelujah amen in other words
[41:50] sometimes working with somebody you
[41:52] share the same interest I hope Walking
[41:55] with God tonight and not only tonight
[41:57] but every day we share the same interest
[42:01] hallelujah we're traveling in the same
[42:03] direction amen not not opposite
[42:06] directions but we're going in the same
[42:08] directions and we're traveling at the
[42:10] same
[42:11] Pace amen they used to tell me the older
[42:15] folks used to tell me when they came to
[42:17] the church cuz they some of them walked
[42:19] to church back in the old days back in
[42:21] the days of the tent revivals and stuff
[42:23] and said the only way they had to get
[42:25] home at because they stayed at church
[42:27] all day and all the way they had to get
[42:29] back home the sun was done down they had
[42:31] to go by Lantern light and they said if
[42:33] you got ahead of the light you messed up
[42:35] if you got the laging behind the light
[42:37] you messed up we got to keep the same
[42:39] Pace we got to walk in the light as he
[42:41] is the light as he shs lights as we walk
[42:44] in the light cuz if we get ahead of the
[42:45] light we'll mess up if we get behind the
[42:48] light we'll mess
[42:50] up so you got to be walking the same
[42:52] direction the same Pace no distractions
[42:56] yeah amen
[42:59] hallelujah you see people driving all
[43:01] the time on their cell phones and stuff
[43:05] distractions amen you see people in this
[43:08] life that's trying to walk with but they
[43:10] got distractions oh God let us get rid
[43:13] of the distractions amen and just walk
[43:15] with him whatever may be distracting us
[43:18] from a fully walk with God Amen and
[43:21] another thing about his walk it was
[43:23] heartfelt amen I believe my walk should
[43:27] be heartfelt in other words amen I
[43:30] believe when I come to the house of God
[43:32] oh and I say Amen or I say praise the
[43:35] Lord or I lift my hands and say
[43:37] hallelujah or whatever it is I don't
[43:39] want to just be going you know how it is
[43:41] they said David are you working are you
[43:43] just going through the motions are you
[43:45] doing this are you just going through
[43:46] the motions are you doing this or you
[43:48] just sweeping everything under the rug I
[43:50] don't want to go through the motions
[43:51] tonight I don't want to just sweep
[43:53] everything under the rug but I want it
[43:54] to be heartfelt when I say amen I want
[43:57] it to be heartfelt when I raise my hands
[44:00] I want I want something on the inside
[44:02] from the inside to really mean it I want
[44:04] to come from way down
[44:06] inside rivers of Living Water springing
[44:10] up to everlasting

[44:19] want to be his
[44:21] friend he called Abraham his friend and
[44:25] Abraham we were the RO Seed of Abraham I
[44:27] believe he'll be our friend amen another
[44:31] thing about Enoch's walk it was one of
[44:34] great communication amen I believe he
[44:37] had great communication oh that's what I
[44:40] want you take two two people married man
[44:43] and woman there's got to be some
[44:45] communication

[47:38] day or two or just on Sunday morning
[47:40] Sunday afternoon but I believe it was
[47:42] every day another thing about Enoch's
[47:45] walk it was a life that was
[47:49] Progressive in other words I believe he
[47:52] enjoyed more amen and the more he
[47:54] enjoyed the more he understood and the
[47:57] more he understood the more he
[47:59] loved amen and the more he loved the

[48:14] enjoy more I can understand more I can
[48:17] love more I can receive more and I can
[48:20] give out
[48:22] more
[48:23] hallelujah amen it was one that was
[48:26] Progressive another thing about Enoch's
[48:29] walk I believe it was a holy life
[48:33] yeah I believe it was one of Holiness
[48:36] amen cuz I believe God will never walk
[48:38] outside the way of Holiness amen the
[48:41] Bible says the Lord has no company with
[48:43] the unjust and the rebellious amen but
[48:46] it was a holy life amen I believe his
[48:49] life was pleasing it was one of great
[48:51] communication amen he realized in the
[48:53] divine presence amen and also it was AO
[48:57] oh he wanted to make sure everything was
[48:59] holy holy unto the Lord holy holy unto
[49:02] the Lord you remember when the priests
[49:05] when they went behind the veil they were

[49:16] pomegranate and when they walked it
[49:18] walked it rang out holy holy holy unto
[49:22] the Lord holy holy unto the Lord amen
[49:25] and they say that Legend in history says
[49:28] that they tied a rope around the
[49:30] priest's ankle because the priest was
[49:33] the only one that could go back there
[49:35] and if if he
[49:37] died that's how they did drag him
[49:40] out now you know how they told that he
[49:42] was dead his Bell stopped ringing oh God

[58:35] mistakes be stepping stones to others
[58:38] Amen Let Me Be an influence to others
[58:40] Lord amen oh it's an honor another thing
[58:44] about his walk it was one that was
[58:46] noteworthy right all it said was he not
[58:49] walk with God right what else needs to
[58:51] be said that's right when you like that
[58:54] brother wait
[58:55] to be put on your Tombstone when it came
[58:57] back or
[58:58] whatever and brother way
[59:01] Dell the day you were born the day you
[59:03] died and it says and he walked with
[59:06] God what what an opportunity man what a
[59:10] thing to be oh that's all it was said
[59:12] and Enoch walked with God who needs much
[59:15] details just that he walked with God oh
[59:18] God I don't need much details tonight
[59:20] just that I walk with God just that I
[59:22] took God in his word just that I serve
[59:25] God with all my
[59:28] heart he might have been a public man I
[59:31] don't know if he worked out anywhere or
[59:32] not but you know what he had a testimony
[59:36] and others oh I want my life to be an
[59:38] influence wherever I go whatever I do
[59:41] hey man I remember one time there's a
[59:43] lady came to our church years ago and
[59:45] she come and she's going home now I
[59:47] didn't know she was going on I lost
[59:49] contact with her you know how it is
[59:51] sometimes you like to pull up thing I
[59:52] seen her obituary when she died I said
[59:54] my you know and I talked to her and she
[59:56] come to church I invited her she come to
[59:59] church her and friend of mine I helped
[1:00:01] him clean some buildings part time he
[1:00:03] come and they were boyfriend and
[1:00:05] girlfriend they Liv together and she
[1:00:07] said David I think it's all right you
[1:00:08] know and all that so I said well I said
[1:00:10] okay let me ask you a question said you
[1:00:12] think it's all right but let me say what
[1:00:14] the other people
[1:00:15] think and she said oh you know and she
[1:00:18] come to church you can ask my wife she
[1:00:20] lived out there and maybe I wouldn't
[1:00:22] preach maybe our pastor would preach or
[1:00:24] whatever and she' leave out there and
[1:00:25] tears would be rolling down her eyes
[1:00:28] amen I don't know where she stood with
[1:00:29] the Lord but I hope that my life was an
[1:00:31] influence amen oh he made his life I
[1:00:34] believe Enoch's life was an influence to
[1:00:36] those around him amen maybe to his
[1:00:39] children or whatever it was amen also I
[1:00:42] believe he was a family man the Bible
[1:00:44] says he begat sons and daughters and
[1:00:46] maybe you know how hey I I I I I do it
[1:00:49] like this a lot of people told me
[1:00:51] brother homers told me a lot of people
[1:00:53] even myself when first come up I
[1:00:55] remember when we first came in the
[1:00:56] message 1969 my I still got them records
[1:00:59] that my dad had the great Harlot and all
[1:01:02] that stuff little red records and
[1:01:03] everything and that you know the real to
[1:01:05] reals and stuff like that hey and many
[1:01:08] times my mom and dad brother Homer even
[1:01:10] myself when I became a married and got a
[1:01:12] family sometimes you had to wait till it
[1:01:13] was Plum
[1:01:14] quiet to house everything was settled
[1:01:18] down and then you could
[1:01:20] listen and absorb so maybe he was a
[1:01:24] family man maybe he had to wait till
[1:01:26] every night till everything was settled
[1:01:27] down and he could say Lord what would
[1:01:30] you have me to know today Papa God what
[1:01:33] would you want your servant he KN to
[1:01:34] know oh my just oh he he was he he oh he
[1:01:38] still was a family man he still walked
[1:01:40] with God Amen the Bible say he lived in
[1:01:43] an evil age is a day of mockers and
[1:01:46] despisers where few love God church and
[1:01:49] state were proposing Alliance fashion
[1:01:51] and pleasure Ru the hour and unhollow
[1:01:53] compromise was the order of the day
[1:01:56] right
[1:01:58] amen but you know what he still walked
[1:02:00] with God now I don't know where I put
[1:02:03] this paper it may be at home but I had a
[1:02:05] paper where this one writer writes about
[1:02:08] the conditions between Enoch and the
[1:02:10] flood and I'm just going to kind of
[1:02:12] paraphrase it but he said there's sin
[1:02:14] everywhere yep Conformity to the world y
[1:02:17] the sethites and the
[1:02:20] Canaanites and said it was mixed
[1:02:23] marriages and things were just hey amen
[1:02:26] World everywhere amen where and and and
[1:02:29] Longevity they thinking they had long
[1:02:32] life could live long and then they put
[1:02:34] the Judgment of God out of the picture
[1:02:36] they didn't think they they they thought
[1:02:38] man judgment who cares about judgment
[1:02:39] we're going to eat drink and be married
[1:02:41] and that's how it was and he he took his
[1:02:44] he took his thoughts from Psalms 14:1
[1:02:46] where it says the fool has said in his
[1:02:47] heart there's no God Amen hey he don't
[1:02:50] just say it like that they come out and
[1:02:52] say but the way they live and the way
[1:02:54] they act and their attitude proves that
[1:02:57] they they're saying that there's no God
[1:02:59] or they think there's no God and the the
[1:03:02] dress the the way they dress was evil
[1:03:04] the way they walk was evil their ways
[1:03:07] were evil their thoughts were evil their
[1:03:09] imaginations were evil their designs
[1:03:11] were
[1:03:12] evil but you know what all that was evil
[1:03:15] but in all that Noah and Enoch both
[1:03:19] without the Holy Ghost like me you have
[1:03:20] it the Bible says they walk with God
[1:03:23] hallelujah they could in the conditions
[1:03:26] that they had what about me and you with
[1:03:28] the Holy Ghost with God on the inside of
[1:03:30] us amen oh we are be like David said I
[1:03:33] feel like running through a troop and
[1:03:35] jumping over a high
[1:03:39] wall
[1:03:41] Heen
[1:03:43] hallelujah hallelujah what a walk amen
[1:03:47] what a walk amen and the Bible says over
[1:03:51] there he bore witness in other words he
[1:03:53] could not be be silent hey sometimes we
[1:03:56] can't be silent if you got to say
[1:03:58] something sometimes hey set in love now
[1:04:01] sometimes if you can't sit with words
[1:04:02] just let let your life live it amen but
[1:04:05] Enoch bore witness he he couldn't keep
[1:04:07] still amen we used to sing a song back
[1:04:10] in Pentecost I just you know it says Hey
[1:04:13] I just can't keep it to myself I got to
[1:04:16] tell somebody else and when the Fire
[1:04:18] gets the burning way down the inside
[1:04:21] amen I just can't help it I got to tell
[1:04:23] somebody else

[1:23:01] real good I thought my listen what he
[1:23:03] says this is on Father the hour has come
[1:23:08] 1956 he said now Jehoshaphat his
[1:23:11] son raising up to take his place had a
[1:23:15] good background to look at upon to see
[1:23:18] that when a man now listen what he says
[1:23:21] to see that when a man will walk for
[1:23:24] God and walk with
[1:23:27] God God will walk with that
[1:23:30] man when a man will walk for God and
[1:23:33] with God God will walk with that man but
[1:23:36] when that same
[1:23:37] individual turns his back from God then
[1:23:41] God just lets him shift for hisself and
[1:23:44] we find out it's very sad thing when we
[1:23:47] have to shift for ourselves that's right

[1:24:06] or do you want to walk with him he said
[1:24:08] when a man will walk with God and for
[1:24:10] God God will walk with him but when that

[1:24:15] him shift for himself let's B our heads
