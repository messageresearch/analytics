[20:19] father of our lord jesus christ who hath
[20:21] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[20:23] in heavenly places in christ
[20:26] according as he hath chosen us in him
[20:28] before the foundation of the world that
[20:30] we should be holy and without blame
[20:32] before him in love having predestinated
[20:35] us under the adoption of children by
[20:37] jesus christ himself according to the
[20:39] good pleasure of his will
[20:40] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[20:42] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[20:44] beloved in whom we have redemption
[20:47] through his blood the forgiveness of
[20:48] sins
[20:50] according to the riches of his grace
[20:51] wherein hath abounded toward us in all
[20:54] wisdom and prudence having made known
[20:56] unto us the mystery of his will
[20:58] according to his good pleasure which he
[21:00] hath purposed in himself that in the
[21:03] dispensation of fullness of times he
[21:05] might gather together in one all things
[21:07] in christ both which are in heaven and
[21:09] which are on earth even in him in whom
[21:13] also
[21:15] we have obtained an inheritance being
[21:17] predestinated according to the purpose
[21:19] of him who worketh all things after the
[21:21] council of his own will
[21:23] that we should be to the praise of his
[21:26] glory who first trusted in christ
[21:29] and whom he also trusted after that ye
[21:32] heard the word of truth the gospel of
[21:34] your salvation and whom also after
[21:38] that you believe you were sealed with
[21:40] that holy spirit of promise which is the
[21:42] earnest of our inheritance unto the
[21:44] redemption
[21:46] of the purchased possession unto the
[21:48] praise of his glory
[21:52] and
[21:53] hebrews chapter one
[21:55] let's go up there somebody's got the
[21:59] scripture
[22:00] mixed up there anyway
[22:03] hebrews chapter one is very familiar
[22:05] scripture
[22:06] and it says god who at sundered times
[22:08] and in divers matters spake in times
[22:10] past unto the fathers by the prophets
[22:13] hath in these last days spoken unto us
[22:15] by son whom he hath appointed heir of
[22:18] all things by whom also he made the
[22:20] worlds
[22:22] who being the brightness of his glory in
[22:24] the express image of his person and
[22:26] upholding all things by the word of his
[22:27] power that he had by himself purged our
[22:30] sins when he had by himself purge our
[22:33] sins sat down on the right hand of the
[22:35] majesty on high being made so much
[22:38] better than the angels as he hath by
[22:40] inheritance obtained a more excellent
[22:42] name than they amen god bless you
[22:44] tonight you can be seated
[22:47] and
[22:50] i
[22:52] want to take a little thought
[22:55] called
[22:57] expression of the attributes of god
[23:02] and
[23:03] brother bran this is quote number one
[23:05] brother of the rem says in in christ the
[23:07] mystery of god
[23:10] he said now god's secret mystery
[23:12] he had before the world began
[23:15] now back in the back part of god's mind
[23:17] there was something that he was trying
[23:20] and was going to achieve and he had made
[23:22] a motive in doing it in order to let
[23:25] himself be expressed
[23:27] because first there wasn't even a moon
[23:30] star atom molecule or anything he was
[23:32] god
[23:34] but he exactly wasn't god at that time
[23:35] because god is an object of worship and
[23:37] there wasn't nothing to worship him so
[23:40] in his great mind he wanted these
[23:41] attributes to be expressed and in him
[23:43] was love in him was to be father and him
[23:46] was to be son and him was to be savior
[23:48] in him was to be healer and all these
[23:51] great attributes that we
[23:53] we see already expressed
[23:56] they were in god
[23:59] and
[24:01] so i
[24:02] and
[24:06] um
[24:08] the quote number two here is uh
[24:10] is the word
[24:12] expression
[24:15] and
[24:16] the definition here um the definition of
[24:19] the word expression i want to
[24:21] lay this out um
[24:23] it says the process of making one's
[24:27] one's own thoughts
[24:29] or feelings known
[24:33] making known one's thoughts or feelings
[24:36] i look of
[24:38] on someone's face that conveys a
[24:39] particular emotion
[24:42] a word or phrase especially
[24:44] an idiomatic one used to convey an idea
[24:48] an act process or means by putting
[24:50] something
[24:51] into words
[24:54] so
[24:55] i i want to look at something tonight
[24:58] about being
[24:59] about the expression of the attributes
[25:01] of god and you know
[25:03] it's so amazing sometimes when you when
[25:05] you
[25:06] read the scripture
[25:08] you know
[25:10] it's so amazing when you when you see
[25:13] where you came from
[25:15] and to where you are
[25:18] you know when you begin to read here in
[25:21] ephesians chapter one it it just it's so
[25:24] it's so amazing
[25:27] and you know you know the song says
[25:28] there's no other word
[25:30] for grace but amazing
[25:34] when you begin to see here
[25:38] he said bless and be the god and father
[25:39] of our lord jesus christ
[25:41] who have blessed us with all spiritual
[25:43] blessings in heavenly places so we know
[25:46] that he
[25:47] the heavenly places is a position that
[25:49] the believer has in christ
[25:52] and we know that you know that
[25:54] goes back to
[25:56] what uh broadway's been preaching on
[25:58] adoption having a position that god has
[26:01] placed you and you have a position to
[26:03] come to in christ
[26:05] and he has and he's blessed us to come
[26:07] to that place
[26:09] you're in a you're you're blessed to be
[26:10] in the place that you are today
[26:13] if you're in christ then you're an
[26:15] overcomer so you've been blessed to come
[26:16] to this place
[26:18] but you know there's a greater place to
[26:20] come to
[26:21] and you know that's the blessings of god
[26:24] and it says according as he has
[26:26] chosen us in him
[26:29] you know i'm so glad he chose me
[26:32] you know he made a way for me to come
[26:35] through in the great mind of god he knew
[26:37] the plan of salvation that he would
[26:39] choose me that that he knew that he if
[26:41] he brought the word in that i would
[26:42] receive it
[26:44] that he had made that that i was always
[26:46] a part of him
[26:49] and you know and you know as brother
[26:51] brown said you know he said if you
[26:52] receive eternal life you always were
[26:55] eternal you are always in the mind of
[26:57] god you're always a part of him
[26:59] and so we always that we we were a part
[27:02] of him that we were chosen in him before
[27:03] the foundation of the world
[27:05] you know there was a place that god
[27:07] called us to be overcomers before the
[27:09] foundation of the world god saw you as
[27:11] an overcomer before the foundation of
[27:12] the world for the foundation of the
[27:15] world
[27:16] and your faults and failures and your
[27:18] sins and your shortcomings you still
[27:19] knew that you had overcome
[27:22] and god
[27:24] looked down through time to see and they
[27:26] and here it knew that you would be in
[27:28] laodicea in in this in this spiritual
[27:31] wicked time but he knew that you'd be an
[27:33] overcomer
[27:36] and so sometimes when we see these
[27:37] things you know to realize who we are
[27:41] you know because i you you can't
[27:44] sometimes you just can't put into words
[27:45] what that means it means you know
[27:48] because i i get stirred up sometimes
[27:50] because you know we can we get so
[27:52] blinded to the things of what god is
[27:55] trying to convey to us or what god wants
[27:56] to tell us but to see who we really are
[27:59] what god has blessed us to
[28:02] you know who who who am i that that he
[28:05] that he would take that he would leave
[28:07] the throne of glory
[28:09] all of the all of his glory and splendor
[28:11] but he would come and and condescend to
[28:14] me
[28:16] and if there was nobody else to be saved
[28:18] he would come and he would do all of
[28:20] that to save me
[28:23] it's it's a glorious thing to know what
[28:25] god thinks of you
[28:28] you know
[28:29] uh brother adam was talking about you
[28:31] know he said if i had the literal blood
[28:33] of jesus christ you know how how i would
[28:36] you know watch over and protect it and
[28:38] you know he'd be so careful with it
[28:40] but he said you know it's it's more that
[28:43] that the purchased possession of that
[28:45] blood is is you and i we're we are the
[28:48] purchased possession of that blood so if
[28:50] we've been bought by uh by the blood of
[28:53] jesus christ if we've been bought by a
[28:54] price then you know what how much
[28:56] greater does he think of you and i
[28:59] than he did of his own life because he
[29:01] he came
[29:02] he came and he exchanged his life for
[29:06] yours
[29:08] when you go when you go to the store and
[29:10] you take money into a store to buy
[29:12] something and you walk in there and you
[29:14] see something then you
[29:17] value what the the va that item that you
[29:20] go in there and buy you value that more
[29:22] than your money
[29:25] so you have a value so you put a value
[29:27] to that so whatever you whatever you
[29:29] long for whatever you desire you put a
[29:31] value on that and you say that that is
[29:34] more valuable that means more to me than
[29:37] what i have
[29:40] so he did you know because he came to
[29:42] give his life for yours
[29:45] to know to know what would take place
[29:47] that it that he would come and pay the
[29:49] price for you and i right
[29:52] and how how wonderful that is to realize
[29:54] what he thinks of you and i man
[30:02] he said according to us he hath chosen
[30:04] us in him before the foundation of the
[30:06] world that we should be holy and without
[30:08] blame before him in love
[30:10] having predestinated us unto the
[30:11] adoption of children by jesus christ
[30:13] himself according to the good pleasure
[30:16] of his will
[30:18] so he he called us to adoption
[30:21] amen
[30:22] so not just not just not just to be a
[30:26] a child of god but there's a place to
[30:28] come to
[30:30] so so it's not just you know because we
[30:32] don't just want to have have our
[30:34] children be our children but we want
[30:36] children to grow up and we want we want
[30:38] them to come to maturity and we want we
[30:39] want them to express these things that
[30:43] that are that are right and proper
[30:46] so when he come you know it was it
[30:48] wasn't that he just gave us eternal life
[30:50] but he called us to adoption but he made
[30:52] a way for us to come to the statue of
[30:54] fullness of christ that we can manifest
[30:56] jesus christ
[30:58] to make jesus christ known
[31:01] he said that we should be holy and
[31:02] without blame before him in love
[31:06] i'm so i'm so glad you know because what
[31:08] whatever whatever our our our sins are
[31:11] what whatever our shortcomings you know
[31:13] what there's still a greater blood
[31:15] there's still a
[31:17] greater covering for all that
[31:19] no matter what your what your sins are
[31:21] what are those though they'll be scarlet
[31:23] no matter what it is they're still away
[31:25] god's made because the the sea of god's
[31:28] forgetfulness is greater than all of
[31:30] that
[31:31] greater than all my sins greater than
[31:32] all all of my pain greater than anything
[31:35] he's greater than that
[31:37] he's greater than all that i'll ever
[31:39] face
[31:41] why he said he said who can separate me
[31:43] from the love of god paul said
[31:46] he said he said
[31:48] can death can nakedness can famine can
[31:50] all these things is there anything in
[31:52] the world no there's nothing
[31:54] the devil will try to separate you but
[31:56] you know what he's a failure he's always
[31:59] going to fail but you know he will try
[32:01] but you know what there's no way he's
[32:02] going to be able to separate you
[32:05] well because you've been engraved in the
[32:06] palms of his hands there's no way that
[32:08] he's going to lose you
[32:10] he said he said i've called my own and
[32:12] he said no one can pluck them from my
[32:14] hands
[32:16] well that's what god has called us to
[32:22] when we see it when we see ourselves in
[32:24] the word
[32:25] when we see ourselves we realize how how
[32:28] short
[32:29] below our standard we live
[32:33] we we understand how who we are
[32:36] but you know what he's still there
[32:38] leading us
[32:39] he's still guiding us he still loves us
[32:47] he said to the praise of the glory of
[32:48] his grace wherein he hath made us
[32:50] accepted in the beloved
[32:54] see i didn't have to be accepted
[32:58] i was accepted in him
[33:02] in whom we have redemption through his
[33:04] blood the forgiveness of sins
[33:07] according to the riches of his grace
[33:10] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[33:12] all wisdom and prudence
[33:16] having made known unto us the mystery of
[33:17] his will according to his good pleasure
[33:20] which you have purposed in himself
[33:23] amen
[33:25] he made known to us the mystery of his
[33:27] will
[33:30] and
[33:32] i read i read christ the mystery there
[33:34] brother i'm talking about the secret
[33:35] mystery
[33:36] that god had that he had a purpose in
[33:39] that secret mystery
[33:42] you know
[33:44] and i don't i don't i don't want to
[33:46] sound funny but
[33:48] it it may it may sound funny but you
[33:50] know some people want one you know if
[33:52] you understand what a secret is you know
[33:54] if if i had something
[33:56] and nobody knew about it
[34:00] and i told brother boyd that you know
[34:02] what brother boyd and i have a secret
[34:05] but you know what they would it would be
[34:06] s it would be a secret to the rest of
[34:08] you
[34:11] but so when we say we have a we have a
[34:13] secret well really me and brother boyd
[34:15] know about it but y'all don't that's the
[34:17] secret
[34:19] that's the reason in hebrews or amos 3 7
[34:21] he said that he would reveal his secret
[34:24] under the his servants the prophet see
[34:26] he was making known that secret by the
[34:28] unfolding of the word was coming through
[34:30] the prophets
[34:32] as they were building the body
[34:34] the ministry that they had
[34:36] that was the secret that was being made
[34:38] known
[34:41] but then in the in the last time it
[34:42] would it would become a mystery
[34:46] why because as it becomes as it begins
[34:48] to unfold then it becomes a mysterious
[34:51] thing
[34:54] now you know you know and and i i know
[34:57] some some people don't
[35:00] you hate you hate but some people don't
[35:02] though if you listen to them sometimes
[35:04] you wonder if if they think that brother
[35:06] branham come to it's like well you know
[35:08] what i was i was in denominations or i
[35:10] was in the world or wherever and brother
[35:11] branham come and he preached and and he
[35:13] come to preach to make us more confused
[35:15] than we were in organized religion and
[35:18] that was that was the mystery
[35:22] he's like he can't he come to confuse us
[35:27] and it's like that's and it's like no no
[35:29] no no no you you got to understand the
[35:31] the
[35:32] he said the unto no
[35:35] having made known unto us the mystery of
[35:38] his will
[35:41] i would you catch it he wanted us to to
[35:44] make known unto us the mystery
[35:47] well what is the finishing of a mystery
[35:50] it's a revelation
[35:54] so when you have a mystery see it had to
[35:56] become a secret first
[36:00] because if you if you've never seen
[36:01] anything if you've never heard of
[36:02] anything then it's a secret dude because
[36:04] you don't know it exists
[36:09] just when just when you know if you know
[36:11] what you
[36:13] you know you go to school and they they
[36:15] talk about certain things and you know
[36:17] you they start teaching you things well
[36:19] if you don't if you don't know anything
[36:20] about it guess what it's all a mystery
[36:22] to you
[36:25] just just like
[36:26] when lewis and clark went on their
[36:28] expedition and they had a black man in
[36:29] the group and the and the indians when
[36:31] they when lewis and clark went to the
[36:33] indians they had never seen the black
[36:34] men before
[36:36] they never they didn't know and they
[36:38] were so mysterious i mean it was so
[36:40] mesmerized by this man
[36:43] that they that they were you know just
[36:46] gingerly walking up to this man looking
[36:48] at him
[36:50] said they tried to rub the black off of
[36:52] him
[36:53] why they've never seen one before
[36:57] but so and it's the same way with us you
[36:59] know when god begins to unfold things it
[37:01] becomes a mysterious thing
[37:05] just you know when the first time that
[37:07] and unless you unless you always knew
[37:10] something well the first time if you
[37:12] grew up in a in a trinitarian background
[37:14] trinitarian church the first time
[37:16] somebody got up and preached on water
[37:17] baptism in jesus name in acts 2 38 and
[37:20] you might have read the bible up ten
[37:22] times you might have got a bunch of gold
[37:23] stars at church but you know when you
[37:25] read acts 2 38 it didn't mean anything
[37:27] to you
[37:30] you'd ran over and just skimmed right
[37:32] over and all of a sudden was somebody
[37:34] coming in and said baptize in the name
[37:36] of jesus christ for the remission of
[37:38] sins
[37:40] and then all of a sudden it catches your
[37:41] attention and it's like
[37:45] are we baptizing right
[37:48] then all of a sudden then it becomes a
[37:50] mystery why because it it wasn't it
[37:52] wasn't it wasn't hid
[37:55] it's always in black and white it's
[37:57] always been in the bible
[38:01] somebody had somebody had a piece of
[38:02] paper over in your bible and one day
[38:04] they just peeled it off oh there it is
[38:07] no it was always there but it but
[38:09] through god's grace he opened your eyes
[38:11] to that
[38:13] and then all of a sudden people's like
[38:14] well uh
[38:15] you know then they begin to think well
[38:17] is is that right
[38:21] then then it becomes a mystery was it
[38:23] why why why are they always reading
[38:25] matthew 28 19 and was acts 2 38
[38:29] and then it's all like
[38:30] then all of a sudden you realize hey you
[38:31] know what
[38:32] matthew 28 19 and acts 2 38 it's the
[38:35] same scripture
[38:39] but they don't they don't see that
[38:42] all of a sudden no we got to take this
[38:43] scripture not that scripture
[38:45] no they dovetail
[38:47] it's like well you know because then
[38:49] that's that was a scripture
[38:51] that peter had on the day of pentecost
[38:53] when the holy ghost failed and the holy
[38:55] ghost started leading peter and he began
[38:57] to speak and they took that scripture
[38:59] and he said and this
[39:01] this promise is unto you
[39:03] and your children to them that's far off
[39:05] even as many as the lord and our god
[39:06] shall call
[39:09] well
[39:10] well i guess if god calls me i guess i
[39:12] need to take that scripture i guess he's
[39:14] calling me i guess that's the scripture
[39:15] that belongs to me
[39:18] but then somebody was like well no no
[39:21] well our church believes this
[39:24] our church believes this
[39:26] well that's why i was baptized
[39:30] and they stay right where they're at
[39:34] and so then they turn the word down
[39:38] because god's showing them
[39:40] what the truth is
[39:42] to show there's there what god has made
[39:45] known so he's making known the mystery
[39:47] of his will which is his word
[39:51] and it's a continue and it's not just
[39:53] one thing but it's a continuation to uh
[39:56] realize who you are and who
[39:58] who he is
[39:59] and what god has called called us to
[40:03] he said that in the dispensation of the
[40:05] fullness times he might gather
[40:07] together in one all things
[40:11] in christ
[40:13] both which are in heaven
[40:14] which are on earth even in him
[40:17] in whom we have obtained an inheritance
[40:20] oh now
[40:22] everybody likes the word inheritance
[40:24] we got we got something now see
[40:27] god being predestinated according to the
[40:29] purpose of him who worketh all things
[40:31] after the council of his own will
[40:34] so he didn't he didn't come to give us
[40:36] an inheritance
[40:38] he come to bring us back to our
[40:40] inheritance
[40:42] why because we see that we were chosen
[40:44] in him before the foundation of the
[40:46] world
[40:47] he had a place so he's taken us back to
[40:48] where we came from
[40:50] us to see who we really are where we
[40:52] came from
[40:54] not just not just living in
[40:57] in these three dimensions
[41:01] but god has something greater for us to
[41:04] know that where we came from
[41:06] and this is just this is just
[41:08] these things are temporal and all these
[41:10] things but there's something that's
[41:12] eternal
[41:13] there's a place to go to that's eternal
[41:20] he said in whom he said that we may that
[41:23] we should be to the praise of his glory
[41:25] who first trusted in christ in whom ye
[41:28] also trusted that after ye heard the
[41:30] word of truth the gospel of your
[41:31] salvation in whom also after that ye
[41:34] believed you were sealed with that holy
[41:36] spirit of promise
[41:39] i'm so i'm so glad that that i know the
[41:41] truth
[41:43] and i've heard the truth
[41:45] and you know and so many times you hear
[41:46] so many people and you know they talk
[41:48] about having a seed
[41:50] we know we had a seed of representation
[41:52] of predestination but you know paul said
[41:55] we had to hear the word
[41:57] you had to have the seed sown
[41:59] and the seed comes through the body and
[42:01] the word came and then we held on to
[42:04] that word and we were sealed by the holy
[42:06] spirit of promise so it was it was
[42:09] overcoming for us that we held on but we
[42:11] believed what god said and he come and
[42:13] he spoke to us he made known us the
[42:16] mystery of his will he made known his
[42:17] word to us and we believed and we held
[42:19] on to that and we were sealed by that
[42:21] holy spirit because that was the promise
[42:23] of acts 2
[42:25] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[42:27] under the redemption of the purchased
[42:29] possession under the praise of his glory
[42:32] so we know that we have this inheritance
[42:34] god has called us to this this is what
[42:37] god wants us to have and god has it
[42:39] brother ram said he had that great
[42:40] mystery secret that he had before the
[42:42] world began and he wanted to express
[42:44] himself
[42:45] he said he had attributes that he wanted
[42:47] to be expressed
[42:49] and so he had so he set up set up a plan
[42:54] you know that he he set up a plan that
[42:57] would bring to pass
[42:59] all of these attributes
[43:01] you know he said everything in motion
[43:03] you know he he said adam and eve in the
[43:05] garden and and everything that set up
[43:08] everything that
[43:09] they had free moral agency that they
[43:11] ever they wanted to he knew what would
[43:12] take place
[43:14] but thank god that he that he knew what
[43:16] was going to take place and you know you
[43:17] never never catch god out of uh
[43:20] by surprise you know he never was
[43:23] worried about anything why because he
[43:24] already had a plan he already had a
[43:26] purpose he had already had a way made
[43:29] there was a lamb slain before the
[43:30] foundation of the world that would all
[43:32] take care of all of that
[43:34] so all of that was taken care of we
[43:36] didn't have to worry about any of that
[43:38] because god had a way mate
[43:40] and so when all of that was what was
[43:42] going on it wasn't that that god had to
[43:45] had to worry about or try to figure out
[43:48] some people talk about you know well
[43:49] adam and eve fell and god had god had to
[43:51] send his son
[43:53] no his son had already came it stood as
[43:56] a lamb slain before the foundation of
[43:57] the world before there was ever a
[43:59] molecule or an atom before there was
[44:02] anything before because of being the
[44:04] thought the eternal thoughts of god the
[44:06] lamb was already slain he knew what
[44:08] would take place and it was already made
[44:11] well sometimes you know people people
[44:13] you know as brother random said if you
[44:14] could you imagine a four foot pipe all
[44:16] the water in the world in the four foot
[44:18] pipe and the pressure that's in that
[44:20] pipe and god on one side of it trying to
[44:22] give you the holy ghost trying to deal
[44:24] with you and trying to bless you and and
[44:26] you stand under the lord will you help
[44:28] me lord would you give me the holy ghost
[44:30] he's trying to give it to you but the
[44:31] problem is is we can't get ourselves out
[44:33] of the way
[44:34] we can do we don't we can't get to the
[44:36] place where we can dial
[44:41] lord lord help my help my unbelief that
[44:43] i can get out of the way that you can
[44:45] bless me why because you said it was for
[44:47] me and so the problem is is if if god
[44:51] doesn't change and he's done it before
[44:53] and he keeps on doing it and he keeps on
[44:55] making the promise that the problem is
[44:57] not with god
[45:00] then the problem is with me
[45:03] it's my problem
[45:05] that i got to get myself out of the way
[45:09] i got to get myself on the altar and die
[45:11] out
[45:14] all 300 pounds
[45:17] got a lot of dying out to do
[45:23] but there's a lot but you know if we can
[45:25] we can just
[45:26] commit to god and we can submit to god
[45:30] and put our faith in that god can do the
[45:32] work
[45:34] many times everybody you know sometimes
[45:36] we we get so worked up and we're trying
[45:38] to do do's and don'ts and and and you
[45:40] know we're so afraid to walk around on
[45:42] eggshells and stuff and it's like you
[45:44] know the main thing is if you can pray
[45:45] through to god
[45:48] let god talk to you
[45:52] you know you know it's so amazing when
[45:54] when people talk about praying lots of
[45:55] times it's i'm praying i'm doing the
[45:57] talking and then when i get done i say
[45:59] amen and that's it
[46:03] he's like you pick up the phone and you
[46:04] talk to somebody
[46:08] okay bye
[46:11] that's all you
[46:12] get why because they do all the talking
[46:17] now some people think that's me but
[46:18] that's not
[46:22] there's been there's been several people
[46:24] i've i've talked to on the phone and i
[46:25] go
[46:26] mm-hmm
[46:31] and then other times
[46:36] [Laughter]
[46:39] wait and tell you that talk to him on
[46:40] the phone fall asleep snoring his ear
[46:42] wake up
[46:48] i've heard that lots
[46:50] not just behind the pulpit i've actually
[46:52] heard it on the
[46:54] phone but you know god has has a desire
[46:58] for us
[47:00] that he wants us to reach out
[47:02] and and and come to this place that god
[47:04] can bless us and give us what we have
[47:06] need
[47:10] here in here in in hebrews and i i don't
[47:13] i don't know how far i'm going to get
[47:14] with this tonight but
[47:15] uh i i just want to share a few things
[47:18] but
[47:19] here here in hebrews and and
[47:21] understanding who we are and what god
[47:23] has for us and what what he wants us to
[47:26] have
[47:27] us to see who we are
[47:29] and he said god and who in sundried
[47:32] times in endower's manner spake in times
[47:33] past by the father unto the fathers by
[47:37] the prophets
[47:38] as we were speaking earlier the prophets
[47:40] began to speak
[47:41] he revealed his secret through the
[47:43] prophets he said hath in these last days
[47:45] spoken unto us by his son
[47:48] and whom he hath appointed heir of all
[47:49] things by whom he made the world who
[47:51] being the brightness of his glory and
[47:54] the express image of his person
[47:57] and upholding all things by the power of
[47:59] his word when he had purged
[48:01] he
[48:02] when he had by himself purge our sins
[48:04] sat down on the right hand of the
[48:07] majesty on high
[48:09] and i want to i want to look at this
[48:11] this phrase and and some of y'all may
[48:13] remember me preaching a message a number
[48:16] of years ago on the essence of god
[48:19] and when you take the the ex the first
[48:22] phrase here express image
[48:26] one of the translations of this is the
[48:29] expression
[48:31] of the
[48:32] uh
[48:34] the essence of god
[48:38] and so you know many times you can see
[48:41] where they say
[48:42] um
[48:44] they'll say it's the representation
[48:48] of
[48:49] the essence of god
[48:51] or it's the uh
[48:53] the expression of
[48:55] um
[48:57] who god is
[49:00] but you know i i like that i like that
[49:02] where he said
[49:03] he's the translation where it says he's
[49:06] he's the expression of the essence of
[49:09] god
[49:10] and you know if you look at
[49:12] if you if some of you may remember me
[49:14] preaching on that when i talked about
[49:16] what the essence of something is and the
[49:18] essence of something is is the set of
[49:21] attributes or characteristics or
[49:23] qualities of something that makes it
[49:25] what it is
[49:27] without without those qualities or
[49:29] characteristics it's not what it is
[49:33] it has to have each one of those to be
[49:35] what it is
[49:37] and it has it and and the definition
[49:39] says it has it by necessity
[49:43] so it's necessary for him to have the
[49:46] this object or substance or whatever it
[49:48] has to have all of these qualities to be
[49:50] that
[49:51] and so when it has all of these
[49:53] qualities then it says it's by necessity
[49:56] so it must have them but it says it's
[49:58] not by accident
[50:00] he has all these qualities
[50:03] or it this subject and you know we
[50:05] talked about like we talked about like a
[50:07] chair and you know you look at a chair
[50:09] and the chair has a
[50:11] you know a seat it has a back and it has
[50:13] four legs on it
[50:15] but you know if you're talking about a
[50:17] wooden a wood chair well none of these
[50:19] none of these chairs would count
[50:22] because you know brother dale's always
[50:23] said if you start with a white dog in
[50:25] genesis you better end up with a white
[50:26] dog in revelation
[50:28] and whatever he started whatever was in
[50:30] the mind of god in the beginning that's
[50:31] what's supposed to be in the end that's
[50:33] he doesn't change because brother rhymes
[50:35] said he doesn't change in essence or
[50:37] behavior
[50:39] so whatever he started with that's what
[50:40] he's going to end up with
[50:42] so when you look at when you look at a
[50:44] chair when you when you look at that
[50:45] chair when you see that
[50:47] object
[50:48] then you know what characteristics it
[50:50] has because you know what a chair is
[50:54] but when we talk about well people well
[50:56] we're just talking about something to
[50:58] sit on
[51:00] well not necessarily because if it
[51:02] doesn't have the characteristics we're
[51:04] sure you can sit on it
[51:07] but it's not what the what the original
[51:09] word was
[51:12] now that we got we got well we got
[51:14] something that it's made out of wood
[51:15] over here it's this uh piano bench well
[51:17] it's made out of wood
[51:19] but you know what it's it doesn't have a
[51:21] back to it
[51:22] so it's lacking
[51:24] now these these these all
[51:26] i don't know there may be some wood
[51:28] inside effort cut the cushion off of it
[51:30] but you know what that's not that's not
[51:31] what the original word was
[51:34] so when we look at and
[51:37] you know there's
[51:39] the drum seat over there
[51:41] you know it has it has different
[51:43] characteristics but it's not exactly
[51:45] what the original word was
[51:47] so if you don't have what the original
[51:49] word was if you don't have the original
[51:50] characteristics then it's not what was
[51:53] the original
[51:54] and so you have to have the what those
[51:57] characteristics are those attributes
[52:00] that god has
[52:02] then he had he had each one of those and
[52:04] that's what made him god
[52:06] because if he did just like just like he
[52:08] said satan had couldn't be a creator but
[52:11] god could be a creator and he was and
[52:12] satan was just like god except he
[52:14] couldn't create
[52:17] so you know no matter how much satan
[52:19] said that that i will be like the most
[52:22] high and i'm gonna lift myself up you
[52:23] know what he'll never be able to take
[52:25] that place why because he does not have
[52:27] all of the attributes that god has
[52:30] he cannot so he so he'll never take that
[52:33] place but he'll try
[52:36] but when god has all these attributes
[52:38] just like just like when you when you
[52:40] speak of a chair or something all of
[52:41] those attributes that
[52:43] whatever the attributes that god has
[52:45] that's what he wanted to express
[52:48] now he could he could express he could
[52:49] have had children and been a father
[52:53] and and they would have been wonderful
[52:55] that he would that we would have he
[52:57] would have the children of god but he
[52:58] wouldn't have been able to express all
[52:59] of his attributes
[53:02] so he had a he had a plan and a purpose
[53:04] that he wanted to express
[53:06] all of the attributes that were inside
[53:08] of him
[53:09] he wanted he wanted to manifest
[53:10] everything
[53:12] and so when he began to express then
[53:14] then through a fall that he can be a
[53:16] then he can be a savior that he can be a
[53:18] healer
[53:20] and then not only just have the uh the
[53:22] children of god but that he can give
[53:24] that he can give eternal life to the
[53:26] fullest virgins he can he can give it to
[53:29] uh those that are good to to the bride
[53:32] there's other groups that he can give
[53:34] the eternal life to that that he
[53:36] wouldn't have that opportunity if if it
[53:38] was just straightforward hey i'm just
[53:40] gonna have children
[53:42] but there was a plan that so we can see
[53:44] that he is able to expand himself and
[53:47] he's been able to show more of himself
[53:50] to show that the greater attributes that
[53:53] he has
[53:56] and you know because brother ram said
[53:58] that the greatest attribute that you
[54:00] know the essence of god is love
[54:04] and you know you know i was i was
[54:05] talking to a man the other day and
[54:08] and he he belongs to a certain group and
[54:12] you know they uh they don't they don't
[54:14] believe that
[54:15] they believe that the jews are dying
[54:18] done and over with and you know god put
[54:20] away the jews and that was it and
[54:21] they're done and don't worry about it
[54:22] but you know the 144 000 are a bunch of
[54:26] gentiles that they're going to be called
[54:28] in and
[54:29] and he was talking to me about and and i
[54:32] i've never
[54:33] i never heard anybody say such stuff and
[54:37] you know i i you just try to talk to
[54:39] people and they want to talk and
[54:41] i'll just try to help them
[54:44] but you know it's like
[54:46] well what paul what part of the bible in
[54:48] revelation when he said there was 144
[54:50] thousand he called 12 000 out of eight's
[54:52] tribe and he called them by name what
[54:54] part of that don't you understand
[54:59] i mean when when when you go back into
[55:01] scripture and you look at daniel 9 and
[55:03] you start laying out the plan that
[55:05] there's a message and when you talk
[55:07] about the the two witnesses that are
[55:09] coming there's got to be and the
[55:11] scripture tells us that the bride leaves
[55:15] there's the gentiles days are over with
[55:18] and there's a rapture
[55:20] and the word's got to go back to them
[55:25] it's like okay well then then how then
[55:27] if if that if
[55:29] it's like well please explain to me how
[55:31] this works
[55:35] and he said well you don't under you
[55:36] don't understand the two witnesses and i
[55:38] was like well i think i probably got a
[55:40] better idea who they are than you do
[55:45] but you know it's interesting that to
[55:47] hear people talking it's like well you
[55:49] need to understand what this means and
[55:51] you got to understand what that means
[55:52] like what you want me to do is is listen
[55:55] to what what your doctrine is on what
[55:58] the bible says not what the bible says
[56:00] but we're going to look at your doctrine
[56:05] and many times that's the way people are
[56:06] they want you to
[56:08] listen to what what they say it is
[56:11] not what the word of god says
[56:14] and so you know i i don't get to talk to
[56:16] him very all you know just every now and
[56:19] then but i just go by and i just try to
[56:21] give him a word here and word there and
[56:23] you know and i like to hear what he has
[56:25] to say because it's it's interesting to
[56:26] hear what other people
[56:28] what other people believe and
[56:30] and then you just try to
[56:32] sow a little seed here there
[56:37] you know
[56:38] brother brown says here
[56:43] he said this is uh from uh sir we would
[56:45] see jesus
[56:48] 1964.
[56:50] he said in the beginning god was not
[56:52] even god he was the great eternal and in
[56:54] there was attributes attributes was his
[56:57] thoughts
[56:58] and then he become a word
[57:00] like this and a word expressed he said
[57:03] well a thought expressed is a word a
[57:05] word expressed as a thought
[57:07] and then remember
[57:09] he said if you ever was in god's
[57:10] thinking you'll always be there
[57:13] if you've got eternal life you are the
[57:15] expression or the attribute
[57:18] of his thought for this age
[57:20] if not
[57:22] there is only one eternal life and it
[57:24] always existed and you in his mind
[57:28] existed before there was a world
[57:31] that's the reason he said he chose you
[57:33] before the foundation of the world
[57:35] it isn't what we think what somebody
[57:38] else thinks is what god eternal you
[57:41] always was see in his thinking
[57:44] and he said it was in him to be a man to
[57:47] be man that's the reason christ was the
[57:49] expressed image
[57:52] so he was the he was the expression of
[57:55] the essence of god see now he was to be
[57:58] father he was to be son he was to be
[58:00] savior he was to be healer there was
[58:02] nothing
[58:03] there wasn't even an angel or nothing
[58:05] then he created angels then he became
[58:06] god he was worshiped
[58:08] then these are the manifestations of his
[58:10] thinking there is nothing wrong
[58:12] everything is going to turn out
[58:16] all right don't be scared god's big
[58:18] timepiece is ticking right along it'll
[58:20] be there it'll have a church without
[58:22] spot or wrinkle it was in his thinking
[58:25] the thing of it is
[58:27] the thing of it is am i in there
[58:30] and
[58:30] are you in there amen and here he was
[58:34] the great the eternal thought of god
[58:36] expressed into sonship oh my there was
[58:39] god emmanuel then notice then he was the
[58:42] word
[58:44] so we understand that
[58:46] before all
[58:48] you know that we were in his thinking
[58:51] we were a part of him and he thought of
[58:53] all things
[58:54] and as i was saying you know that that
[58:56] he knew that all things was going to
[58:57] take place and brother brown says you
[58:59] know don't worry about it because god
[59:00] already knew what was going to take
[59:01] place
[59:02] and god has a great time peace god has a
[59:04] time piece and he already had everything
[59:05] worked and so it was just going to work
[59:07] out just fine just perfect and we don't
[59:09] have to worry about all we got to do is
[59:10] put our confidence in him because we
[59:12] don't have to know what the future holds
[59:14] but we know who holds the future
[59:17] we know what the
[59:18] what is going to take place why because
[59:20] god's going to lead us
[59:22] i thank god that i can have some place
[59:25] to put my confidence and my trust
[59:28] because there's no other place in this
[59:30] world to be able to have confidence when
[59:31] you see the world and the condition that
[59:34] it's seeing
[59:35] and it's so so thankful that god has
[59:37] given us a word in our day to tell us
[59:40] what's going to take place so when
[59:41] people like my have you ever seen
[59:43] anything like this before can you
[59:45] imagine such things as this yeah god
[59:48] told us in his word it was going to take
[59:50] place
[59:51] yeah we knew this was going to take
[59:52] place why god told us it would happen
[59:54] this way
[59:56] well because he gave us i said to see
[59:59] that we would know these things
[1:00:02] so you know it's it's just right on time
[1:00:06] it's happening just the way it's
[1:00:07] supposed to thank god but we know what's
[1:00:09] going to take place
[1:00:11] yeah we we might have hard times and we
[1:00:13] might have hardships and problems
[1:00:15] everything like that but thank god
[1:00:16] before all this falls apart we're going
[1:00:18] to be out of here
[1:00:20] why because you know what we don't have
[1:00:22] to go through the wrath of god we don't
[1:00:23] have to go through tribulation we're
[1:00:25] going to be out of here there's a way of
[1:00:27] escape that's made for us
[1:00:34] this is from the smyrna church age
[1:00:36] brethren says the eternal thoughts of
[1:00:38] god he said let me ask you are the
[1:00:40] thoughts of god eternal he said if you
[1:00:42] can see this you can see many things god
[1:00:44] is unchangeable and changeable in both
[1:00:46] essence and behavior amen
[1:00:50] he said we have studied that and proven
[1:00:51] that already god is infinite in his
[1:00:53] ability so therefore he is god must be
[1:00:56] omniscient
[1:00:58] he said if he is omniscient then he is
[1:01:01] not now learning nor is he taking
[1:01:03] counsel even with himself nor is he at
[1:01:06] any time adding to his knowledge
[1:01:09] he said if he can add to his knowledge
[1:01:11] and he's not omniscient the best we
[1:01:13] could say that
[1:01:15] at some times he he will be but that is
[1:01:17] not scriptural he is omniscient
[1:01:21] he has never had a new thought about
[1:01:23] anything because all of his thoughts he
[1:01:25] has
[1:01:27] always had and always will have and
[1:01:30] knows the end from the beginning because
[1:01:32] he is god
[1:01:33] he said thus the thoughts of god are
[1:01:35] eternal they are real they are simply
[1:01:37] they are not simply like a man with a
[1:01:39] blueprint he has drawn up and which one
[1:01:42] day will be translated into substance
[1:01:44] and form but they are already real and
[1:01:47] eternal and a part of god
[1:01:51] so thank god that we know that his
[1:01:53] thoughts
[1:01:54] are more real than our thoughts than
[1:01:57] anything because that is what's going to
[1:01:58] take place that is what's real
[1:02:01] he said so then he doesn't have to worry
[1:02:03] about you know having a having a second
[1:02:05] thought or hacking a second opinion
[1:02:07] everything like he knows what's going to
[1:02:08] take place and that's what's going to
[1:02:09] take place
[1:02:11] and that's what we're living today
[1:02:14] and god knew what was going to take
[1:02:15] place knew that knew who would be here
[1:02:17] and who would not be here all of your
[1:02:19] problems everything that would you would
[1:02:21] take play everything that you would do
[1:02:22] in this life
[1:02:25] but thank god he knew that that we would
[1:02:27] come and overcome
[1:02:29] amen amen
[1:02:33] this is from
[1:02:34] john chapter 15
[1:02:37] verses 14 brother rob says or the
[1:02:38] scripture says he said ye are my friends
[1:02:41] jesus speaking he said if you do
[1:02:42] whatsoever i command you
[1:02:45] henceforth i call you not servants for
[1:02:47] the servant knoweth not what his lord
[1:02:49] doeth but i have called you friends for
[1:02:52] all things that i have heard of my
[1:02:54] father i have made known unto you
[1:02:57] he said ye
[1:02:58] have not chosen me but i have chosen you
[1:03:01] and ordained you that you should go and
[1:03:04] bring forth fruit
[1:03:06] and that your fruit should remain
[1:03:08] that whatsoever ye shall ask of the
[1:03:10] father in my name he may give it to you
[1:03:12] these things i command you
[1:03:15] that you love one another and if the
[1:03:16] world hates you you know that it hated
[1:03:20] me before it hated you and if you were
[1:03:22] of the world
[1:03:23] the world would love his own but because
[1:03:26] you're not of the world but i have
[1:03:28] chosen you out of the world therefore
[1:03:30] the world hateth you
[1:03:32] amen i'm so glad to know that
[1:03:34] he called us
[1:03:36] we didn't choose him he chose us
[1:03:39] and he called us to be fruitful
[1:03:42] well then guess what
[1:03:44] the scripture talks about adding to your
[1:03:47] faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and
[1:03:50] and and growing up the statue of a
[1:03:51] perfect man and he said he said if these
[1:03:53] things be in you and abound he said
[1:03:55] you'll not be fruit and fruitless that
[1:03:57] you won't be without fruit
[1:04:00] because you know what the thing is
[1:04:01] here's what he's called you too
[1:04:04] and it's so amazing because many times
[1:04:07] you know we we
[1:04:08] sometimes we don't realize what god has
[1:04:10] called us to
[1:04:12] you know because it's you know brother
[1:04:15] i'm talking about that little fish being
[1:04:16] in the in the water and he's he just
[1:04:18] barely sipping on the water out there in
[1:04:20] the ocean it's like well you know what i
[1:04:21] may run out of water before too long
[1:04:24] and not realizing the vastness of the
[1:04:26] ocean
[1:04:27] and out there well you know i don't know
[1:04:29] how long this thing is going to last and
[1:04:31] not realizing not realizing the vastness
[1:04:34] of god's plan
[1:04:35] or the god's love or his provision to us
[1:04:40] he's like well you know you know i will
[1:04:41] i don't i don't want to
[1:04:43] i don't want to bother god
[1:04:46] you know i i you know you know i don't
[1:04:48] know what to do you know what my my kids
[1:04:50] don't don't mind bothering me
[1:04:53] my kids my kids don't bother me you know
[1:04:56] they don't mind whatsoever and i can
[1:04:58] tell you what your kids didn't don't
[1:05:00] bother my mind bothering you either
[1:05:05] you know because he said he said ask and
[1:05:07] you shall and you shall fight
[1:05:11] seek and you shall find
[1:05:13] knock and it shall be opened unto you
[1:05:16] ask and it shall be given unto you
[1:05:19] you know i got
[1:05:21] my boys you know they don't mind
[1:05:24] something sometimes they get on my
[1:05:25] nerves because i've been there mama mama
[1:05:27] mama mama mama
[1:05:29] mama mama mama mama yeah
[1:05:33] and daddy daddy daddy hey daddy daddy
[1:05:36] daddy
[1:05:37] daddy daddy daddy daddy
[1:05:40] like would you just quit saying daddy
[1:05:41] and just ask what you want
[1:05:45] but you know they don't mind
[1:05:48] and even if you get upset
[1:05:50] and you can you be quiet i'm trying to
[1:05:52] do something okay
[1:05:54] they'll stand right there
[1:05:56] no way all right we waited 30 seconds
[1:05:59] daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy
[1:06:02] daddy daddy
[1:06:07] and he said he said if if your son
[1:06:10] asked you for bread he said would you
[1:06:12] give him a stone
[1:06:15] he said if your child asks you for fish
[1:06:17] would you give him a serpent
[1:06:20] he said he said if ye being evil know
[1:06:22] how to good gifts give good gifts to
[1:06:24] your children
[1:06:26] how much more will your heavenly father
[1:06:28] give
[1:06:29] good gifts to them
[1:06:31] and one place he said we'll give the
[1:06:32] holy ghost
[1:06:34] to those that ask
[1:06:37] so if you have if you have a need you
[1:06:39] have a request but then what it is
[1:06:41] well i don't i don't want i don't know
[1:06:46] you know what the ones that seek and
[1:06:48] press
[1:06:50] and keep pressing and keep pushing and
[1:06:52] keep clawing and whatever it takes and
[1:06:54] keep going forward you know what those
[1:06:56] are the ones that go overcome and get
[1:06:57] what they have need of
[1:07:03] so it's not it's not just going one time
[1:07:05] and well you know i didn't i didn't get
[1:07:07] one i didn't get what i wanted
[1:07:10] well it's the one that stays there just
[1:07:12] just like the the parable of the unjust
[1:07:14] judge you know he he said this woman
[1:07:16] wearies me
[1:07:18] she's there all the time and he said he
[1:07:20] said i don't want to do anything for her
[1:07:22] but because she pesters me so much i'm
[1:07:24] going to do something for her
[1:07:26] i'm going to help her in her situation
[1:07:28] why because i'm tired of dealing with
[1:07:30] her
[1:07:32] well the other thing is
[1:07:33] god doesn't have that same attitude but
[1:07:35] he has the same desire that you would
[1:07:37] seek
[1:07:40] because you know what sometimes god
[1:07:41] wants to see what you're going to do
[1:07:44] he'll come to the place well he said
[1:07:46] well i didn't get it the first time
[1:07:47] we'll get right i'm not going to ask
[1:07:48] anymore
[1:07:49] well you know what you're not going to
[1:07:50] get anything
[1:07:53] just just like when the uh what was the
[1:07:56] syrophoenician woman there you know and
[1:07:57] and you know hey you know she calls out
[1:07:59] son of david and you know what he's like
[1:08:02] ain't no ain't talking to you
[1:08:04] he don't even look in her direction
[1:08:07] he got he got no business talking to her
[1:08:09] don't care
[1:08:12] and then she and then she's you know
[1:08:14] trying to get his attention and calling
[1:08:16] to him
[1:08:17] he ain't listening
[1:08:20] but then when she says lord well he
[1:08:22] turns to her
[1:08:25] what what do you want
[1:08:27] lord i got a sick daughter
[1:08:29] lord i i want you
[1:08:33] to heal my daughter
[1:08:34] my daughter needs to be healed
[1:08:37] well let me tell you something
[1:08:40] you know a lot of people a lot of people
[1:08:41] would get upset when jesus said you know
[1:08:43] it's not me to give the children's bread
[1:08:45] to dogs
[1:08:47] i can't believe he said that to me
[1:08:51] but you know what it didn't matter what
[1:08:52] what he said
[1:08:55] oh anymore all she wanted was for him to
[1:08:57] heal her daughter
[1:09:00] it don't matter what you say jesus i
[1:09:02] don't care you can put me down you can
[1:09:03] say why because it's all true
[1:09:06] but you know what the dog's eating the
[1:09:08] crumbs of the master's table
[1:09:11] that's what i want i don't care what
[1:09:13] else
[1:09:15] he said if we can humble ourselves then
[1:09:17] we'll be raised up
[1:09:18] but the problem is we can't be humbled
[1:09:22] many times we get we allow things to get
[1:09:24] in our way and and hold us back because
[1:09:26] we we can't be humble
[1:09:30] and many times you know
[1:09:32] things will happen and you know people
[1:09:34] get so be uh so upset but things that
[1:09:36] have happened or things that people have
[1:09:38] said and you know the thing is it you
[1:09:40] spend more time worried about something
[1:09:42] that's so inconsequential in the long
[1:09:45] run
[1:09:46] somebody will make it make a comment and
[1:09:48] people will sit and
[1:09:49] and dwell on it for the longest time and
[1:09:52] it just eats them up and it takes up all
[1:09:54] their time why can't what is what do
[1:09:56] they mean by that
[1:09:58] what do they mean by that i can't
[1:09:59] believe they said that
[1:10:03] and then you know they spend all their
[1:10:04] time worrying about what that what that
[1:10:06] means and what what what what somebody
[1:10:09] else says about them i wonder if she
[1:10:10] told somebody else
[1:10:13] and in the long run you know some people
[1:10:15] some people when they when they after
[1:10:16] they dwelled on it for the longest time
[1:10:18] and it's took up all their time and
[1:10:20] worried and they get all upset about it
[1:10:23] you know what whoever said it sometimes
[1:10:25] i don't even remember saying it
[1:10:28] but you know what we we've got to we've
[1:10:30] we've spent all of our time wrapped up
[1:10:32] in things that don't really matter
[1:10:34] and so you know but if if we just stay
[1:10:37] on core if we stay where god has us
[1:10:39] rather than you know we receive what we
[1:10:40] have need of
[1:10:43] just lay all these things down i don't
[1:10:45] you know there's no need of carrying it
[1:10:47] around
[1:10:50] it it ain't it ain't it ain't profitable
[1:10:52] with me it ain't profitable to you guess
[1:10:53] what we're just gonna lay it down
[1:10:55] i'm just gonna put it behind me
[1:10:57] i'm not worried about it because i i
[1:10:59] just can't just can't worry about
[1:11:01] carrying on it
[1:11:02] and dealing with it
[1:11:05] but god wants us to
[1:11:08] be
[1:11:10] what god wants us to be
[1:11:12] to manifest
[1:11:14] this is from the future home
[1:11:19] and
[1:11:20] he says
[1:11:22] he says if if you have if you've got
[1:11:24] eternal life he said there's only one
[1:11:27] form that's god
[1:11:29] and he said you are an expressed
[1:11:30] attribute see
[1:11:32] he said if you're if you if you're not
[1:11:35] you're not going to be there anyhow no
[1:11:37] man can come to me except my father has
[1:11:39] drawn him see
[1:11:41] which passes away all these old things
[1:11:43] but these things don't
[1:11:45] so it speaks of eternity
[1:11:47] the holy ghost is eternal
[1:11:49] then you are in eternity where you
[1:11:53] was all the time
[1:11:55] but you've just recognized what happened
[1:11:59] see you were made for an eternal purpose
[1:12:01] because you was the manifestation of an
[1:12:04] attribute that was in god
[1:12:09] that thought of you and expressed you
[1:12:11] and he made a earth to take you out of
[1:12:14] and made you a human being and sin come
[1:12:16] along and perverted that what his way
[1:12:19] you come anyhow but
[1:12:22] he was lost with the world
[1:12:25] so he come and redeemed you the
[1:12:26] expressed attribute and also redeemed
[1:12:29] this earth by the same same way then see
[1:12:32] his purpose rolls on see oh hallelujah
[1:12:35] oh that does me so good so much good
[1:12:38] think of of just what lies lays ahead
[1:12:43] so we know that
[1:12:45] god we're always
[1:12:46] in the mind of god
[1:12:49] and god come across your path
[1:12:52] and you became
[1:12:53] an expressed attribute
[1:12:57] and god always knew what you would be
[1:12:59] but you came into this earth and and
[1:13:01] through through the new birth you've
[1:13:03] come to this place to be an attribute of
[1:13:05] what god wants you to be
[1:13:08] and so many and he's like well what god
[1:13:10] what does god want us to be what god
[1:13:12] leads us to
[1:13:13] what the word says about us
[1:13:16] because the word is going to lead you
[1:13:18] and so many you know if people get so
[1:13:22] you know upset or they get worked up
[1:13:24] about things just trust god
[1:13:27] let god lead you and he'll show you what
[1:13:29] what needs to be
[1:13:31] what god wants you to do what god wants
[1:13:34] you to be
[1:13:36] many times you know people they they
[1:13:37] want to try to figure things out no
[1:13:40] don't get ahead of god let god work and
[1:13:43] god do the plan god will work the plan
[1:13:46] if we'll do our part
[1:13:48] well because it's a daily walk and if we
[1:13:50] just walk with him
[1:13:52] then you know what all things will run
[1:13:54] perfect
[1:13:57] you know you know we look brother man
[1:13:59] was speaking and he was talking about
[1:14:00] how nature he said nature runs in
[1:14:03] continuity
[1:14:04] he said nature runs in continuity with
[1:14:07] with the word of god
[1:14:09] he said you know so you know we don't
[1:14:11] have
[1:14:12] uh when he spoke and put all these
[1:14:15] things in
[1:14:16] in the world in in place
[1:14:19] you know the the rotation of the earth
[1:14:21] and and the
[1:14:23] earth orbit and all those type things
[1:14:25] all the things that take place you know
[1:14:27] god god spoke them and that was it
[1:14:30] and well you know we can and it's so
[1:14:32] perfect that when we go and look you
[1:14:35] know we can track the years and where
[1:14:38] all the planets will be and all of the
[1:14:40] asteroids and all kinds of things all
[1:14:42] the positions of all these different
[1:14:44] things in the future and in the past we
[1:14:46] know where all these things are one
[1:14:47] because we know there's a perfect
[1:14:50] pattern to all of it
[1:14:52] so when it all sets in when it all
[1:14:54] becomes set in order and it works in
[1:14:56] continuity then guess what you know
[1:14:58] there's not there's not one time where
[1:15:00] where one year that you know we're we're
[1:15:02] a short a few days or we're we're a few
[1:15:04] hours over no it it comes out every
[1:15:08] single year
[1:15:09] 365 and a quarter
[1:15:12] and we don't have to worry about it
[1:15:13] because nothing's out of cater
[1:15:17] but you know what we get so worried
[1:15:18] about trying to fit in or trying to
[1:15:21] figure things out but you know what if
[1:15:22] we just work in continuity with god
[1:15:25] and we put our trust in god then you
[1:15:27] know what he spoke it then guess what
[1:15:28] it's going to work
[1:15:31] then you know i i'm not i'm not trying
[1:15:33] to figure out what i need to do because
[1:15:35] you know i'm just going to trust god
[1:15:36] because let god speak to me
[1:15:39] then then it'll work exactly the way it
[1:15:41] needs to
[1:15:44] it all works in continuity
[1:15:49] you know when and we you see all these
[1:15:53] in in the scripture in different places
[1:15:55] you know brother i'm talking about how
[1:15:57] all all nature and
[1:15:59] all everything works in continuity and
[1:16:02] all things were were spoken by the word
[1:16:04] of god are they all put in place and
[1:16:06] they all have a purpose
[1:16:07] and they do exactly what they're
[1:16:09] supposed to do
[1:16:12] you know
[1:16:13] einstein when you know when brother
[1:16:14] brown always talks about you know
[1:16:15] einstein and all of his all of his
[1:16:18] theories and and all of the things that
[1:16:20] that he was able to do and brother brown
[1:16:21] said if if einstein could have put the
[1:16:23] spiritual with the with the natural
[1:16:25] application he said he really could have
[1:16:27] told us something
[1:16:29] you know when he began to when he began
[1:16:31] to look at all these things and you know
[1:16:32] in einstein being able to see all the
[1:16:34] things that he had saw and understood
[1:16:36] you know brother i'm talking about how
[1:16:38] how man had broke into god's laboratory
[1:16:40] and and you know all the things that he
[1:16:42] could he could talk about and he could
[1:16:44] see any you know brother uh brother i'm
[1:16:46] talking about einstein talking about the
[1:16:48] center of the universe and you know all
[1:16:50] the things that he could prove by
[1:16:52] science and knew what these things were
[1:16:54] and you know and then when when all of
[1:16:57] that was said and done
[1:16:59] when einstein had done all of the things
[1:17:01] that he had done and and studied and
[1:17:03] wrote about and all the experiments then
[1:17:06] then when he said how did all this come
[1:17:09] about
[1:17:11] wasn't one of the greatest being in the
[1:17:13] world one of probably one of the
[1:17:15] smartest men in all the world and there
[1:17:17] he stood and he quotes hebrews 11 3
[1:17:21] that would that we know that the world
[1:17:23] the
[1:17:23] worlds were framed by the word of god
[1:17:27] so we know that the word of god is what
[1:17:29] brought it into pass
[1:17:31] and and all of on all of the the
[1:17:33] learning and the studying and all this
[1:17:34] stuff it only took one thing it was the
[1:17:36] word of god
[1:17:38] that einstein and all the things all of
[1:17:40] the studying and all of the learning and
[1:17:42] everything all of the experiments that
[1:17:43] he could do it took the word of god to
[1:17:45] put all this together
[1:17:47] why because no there's there's nothing
[1:17:49] he said so that the world
[1:17:51] the worlds were made by things which do
[1:17:52] not appear
[1:17:55] so all these things took place and and
[1:17:57] all the vastness and all that kind of
[1:17:59] stuff and then the one thing that he was
[1:18:01] convinced that it took a creator
[1:18:04] it took a divine power to put all this
[1:18:07] together
[1:18:10] and then you know when he said all this
[1:18:12] stuff and he made all this and put it
[1:18:13] all together and then this this was all
[1:18:16] of his expressed attributes these all
[1:18:19] each part come into place and then here
[1:18:22] he said let us make man in our own image
[1:18:26] and after our likeness so this is what
[1:18:28] god called us to to be to be like him
[1:18:32] to god made us and then and then we
[1:18:34] wonder why you know then we allow the
[1:18:37] devil to hold us back
[1:18:39] we're
[1:18:41] bound by by things that the devil has
[1:18:43] allowed us to be get in our way when we
[1:18:46] are to be an overcomer
[1:18:48] what god has created us to to be to be
[1:18:50] in this divine order
[1:18:54] if everything else runs in continuity
[1:18:56] and and has a has a perfect place then
[1:18:59] guess what you and i have a perfect
[1:19:01] place also god has called us into a
[1:19:03] perfect realm
[1:19:07] you know that we don't have we don't
[1:19:09] have to uh worry about what what's going
[1:19:11] to take place god's already made a way
[1:19:13] for us
[1:19:20] this is from the the seed shall not be
[1:19:23] air with a shuck
[1:19:24] he said that's what the church is doing
[1:19:26] today for jesus is the word and he is
[1:19:28] the bridegroom and the bride is a part
[1:19:30] of the groom therefore the word that is
[1:19:32] to be expressed this day is the same
[1:19:35] part of the word that was fulfilled in
[1:19:36] his day
[1:19:38] it's the same word same experience same
[1:19:41] life
[1:19:42] for when god separated adam he was both
[1:19:46] we find out adam was spirit to begin
[1:19:48] with he made man in his own image
[1:19:50] created he male male and female and then
[1:19:53] genesis 2 and on he created man out of
[1:19:56] the dust of the earth man was created in
[1:19:58] god's image god is a spirit so he's a
[1:20:00] spirit man
[1:20:02] then when he became flesh man animal
[1:20:05] flesh on the earth he is showing
[1:20:07] portraying here the bride
[1:20:10] he never taken and made
[1:20:12] another thing but he took part of adam
[1:20:14] the original creation
[1:20:17] took from him a rib from his side and
[1:20:19] took the feminist spirit out of adam
[1:20:21] left the masculine spirit in there and
[1:20:23] placed it in the feminist part therefore
[1:20:27] part of his spirit part of his body
[1:20:29] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word
[1:20:32] of his word life of his life and that's
[1:20:34] the way the bride is to christ
[1:20:37] he said that's why the rapture of the
[1:20:39] royal sea will have to come first
[1:20:45] so we understand that when when god said
[1:20:47] all this in motion then then understand
[1:20:49] that you know as as he took from adam
[1:20:53] he was always in adam she was always a
[1:20:55] part of him but it became that had to be
[1:20:58] a time to be expressed
[1:21:00] and it was a time to be manifested and
[1:21:03] you know he said but she's born of my
[1:21:04] bone flesh of my flesh life of my life
[1:21:07] brother i said it's the same spirit it's
[1:21:09] the same the same experience
[1:21:12] and so all these parts have come
[1:21:14] together and the same way with you and i
[1:21:16] that we were always a part of him that
[1:21:18] we come to be an expression of him
[1:21:21] that what he is that we express the same
[1:21:23] thing that we make known the same thing
[1:21:26] and you know because if he overcame then
[1:21:28] you know what you and i overcome also
[1:21:31] he said he said because i overcame he
[1:21:34] said you will overcome also
[1:21:37] but god has called us to a place that we
[1:21:39] understand how these things take place
[1:21:41] and what's to what's going to take place
[1:21:44] how things are going to unfold
[1:21:47] you know
[1:21:48] um
[1:21:50] speaking of of einstein and
[1:21:53] you know all of the great theories and
[1:21:55] the understanding that he had and all
[1:21:57] the things that that he was able to do
[1:22:00] you know
[1:22:01] if we understand when we look brother
[1:22:04] brahm said the natural types the
[1:22:05] spiritual
[1:22:07] when you look at the natural and you see
[1:22:09] how things work in continuity
[1:22:11] and perfect
[1:22:13] then guess what then you and i are the
[1:22:15] same way
[1:22:18] then you know what that's what god
[1:22:19] called us to
[1:22:22] that god has called us the bride is the
[1:22:24] same as him
[1:22:26] when when he began in the beginning when
[1:22:28] he said let there be light you know what
[1:22:30] he didn't have to worry if that was
[1:22:33] going to come to pass or not
[1:22:35] he said he said when he said let there
[1:22:37] be light he said he said he said he
[1:22:39] believed his own word and there was
[1:22:40] light
[1:22:43] then you know he didn't have to he
[1:22:44] didn't have to worry if it was going to
[1:22:45] take place why because he knew it would
[1:22:47] take place
[1:22:48] and it's the same way with you and i you
[1:22:50] know many times what we would get
[1:22:53] in our in our own way sometimes but
[1:22:55] understand that god has a wife for made
[1:22:58] for us
[1:23:01] and
[1:23:02] you know
[1:23:02] when we look at these things
[1:23:06] i i i want to share this this thought
[1:23:09] with you
[1:23:10] you know when we when we talk about
[1:23:12] physics and
[1:23:14] and all the things that einstein was
[1:23:16] able to prove and
[1:23:18] you know there was one thing that
[1:23:19] einstein had trouble with
[1:23:22] and and somebody and some of y'all may
[1:23:24] know more about this than than i do but
[1:23:26] i i just think it's it's a it's a
[1:23:28] fascinating thing
[1:23:30] but you know all things natural types of
[1:23:32] spiritual
[1:23:35] and you know
[1:23:36] einstein
[1:23:38] and
[1:23:39] other scientists you know
[1:23:42] some of y'all probably know what quantum
[1:23:43] mechanics is
[1:23:50] well it's it's a it's a it's a um
[1:23:54] a quantum is the smallest
[1:23:56] particle
[1:23:57] that can have an interaction with each
[1:23:59] other
[1:24:00] in space
[1:24:01] or in the world
[1:24:03] in the universe but anyway uh in quantum
[1:24:06] mechanics
[1:24:08] it's a uh
[1:24:10] understanding you know there was um
[1:24:13] in the 20th century there were several
[1:24:16] advancements in physics one of them was
[1:24:18] the theory of relativity to understand
[1:24:21] how everything nothing travels faster
[1:24:23] than the speed of light
[1:24:26] and you know how he said if you could
[1:24:28] travel at the speed of light you know
[1:24:30] einstein said you could have two objects
[1:24:32] approaching each other and they'd go
[1:24:33] right through each other and not mess
[1:24:35] either one of them up
[1:24:36] you could pass through each other and
[1:24:39] and so there was something that took
[1:24:40] place in and quantum mechanics was the
[1:24:43] other
[1:24:44] and there is a um
[1:24:47] a thing that takes place with two when
[1:24:49] you have two particles
[1:24:51] and they they become it and there's an
[1:24:52] interaction with these two there's a
[1:24:54] there's a connection that's made between
[1:24:56] these two particles sometimes electrons
[1:24:59] or whatever but usually it's two
[1:25:00] particles and they they have this
[1:25:02] connection that's made between them
[1:25:05] and science calls calls it entanglement
[1:25:10] and when you when you take these two
[1:25:13] items these two so
[1:25:15] particles
[1:25:16] and they they have this relationship and
[1:25:18] they become connected
[1:25:21] and there's a relationship between these
[1:25:23] two particles
[1:25:25] then you can take one of those particles
[1:25:28] and you can move it
[1:25:29] hundreds of light years in one way and
[1:25:31] you can put the other one 100
[1:25:32] hundreds of light years in the other way
[1:25:35] and they're separated
[1:25:37] and what blew einstein's mind is because
[1:25:40] he's
[1:25:42] based on the theory of relativity what
[1:25:43] they proved by relativity
[1:25:46] that if this one's 100 miles away and
[1:25:48] that was 100 miles away then it would
[1:25:50] take the the that traveling the light
[1:25:53] speed of light would have to travel
[1:25:54] between those two particles
[1:25:57] but what in quantum mechanics what they
[1:25:59] were seeing was here's a particle and
[1:26:01] here's a particle
[1:26:03] and when one moves
[1:26:05] this one moves
[1:26:08] but it's instantaneous
[1:26:12] and so here's this one
[1:26:15] and this one is moving in complementary
[1:26:18] to this one
[1:26:20] and as this one moves this one moves
[1:26:23] so if this one's up this one's down
[1:26:26] or vice versa
[1:26:29] and einstein called it spooky action at
[1:26:31] a distance
[1:26:34] because he's standing there thinking
[1:26:38] if they're if they're so far apart then
[1:26:40] light would have to tr how do they how
[1:26:42] do they communicate
[1:26:45] how is that one communicating with that
[1:26:46] one
[1:26:47] and why is this one in complementary to
[1:26:49] that one
[1:26:56] neil niels bohr the danish physicist
[1:26:59] who
[1:27:01] uh we all know from the bohr model of
[1:27:03] the atom
[1:27:05] him and einstein had a debate
[1:27:08] they would debate on on these on these
[1:27:11] these and and nils finally told
[1:27:15] einstein he said he said the problem is
[1:27:18] you're approaching it the wrong way
[1:27:20] he said when you see those two he said
[1:27:22] they're not two
[1:27:25] he said because when they become what we
[1:27:27] call entangled
[1:27:29] he said now you're seeing one
[1:27:32] and he said it doesn't matter where this
[1:27:34] one is or where this one is
[1:27:36] this one's going to move in
[1:27:37] complementary to that one
[1:27:40] and no matter how far apart they are
[1:27:43] they they work in continuity
[1:27:47] and they couldn't figure that one out
[1:27:49] and even today
[1:27:50] dr richard
[1:27:52] uh feinstein who's an american physicist
[1:27:55] his great quote is if you if you think
[1:27:57] you understand quantum mechanics you
[1:27:59] don't understand quantum mechanics
[1:28:02] but science is they they're they can
[1:28:03] they look at something
[1:28:05] and how in the world the two objects can
[1:28:07] be so far apart these two particles
[1:28:10] but they've they've entered into a
[1:28:11] relationship there's something that's
[1:28:13] happened to them
[1:28:15] and really they don't understand how it
[1:28:17] happens but they can look and see the
[1:28:19] effects of it
[1:28:21] and all of a sudden this and neil's
[1:28:23] board told albert he said he said you're
[1:28:25] looking at it wrong he said that's not
[1:28:27] two objects that's one
[1:28:30] he said when you see the he said when
[1:28:32] you see one you see the other
[1:28:35] and jesus said when you see man you sing
[1:28:37] the father
[1:28:39] and here's one and here's the other and
[1:28:41] jesus said i he said what i said well i
[1:28:44] do nothing of myself but what i see the
[1:28:46] father do that through the son likewise
[1:28:49] and so when he's seeing one and they're
[1:28:50] moving in what jesus didn't have his own
[1:28:52] thought
[1:28:53] but he moved in complimentary to the
[1:28:55] father
[1:28:56] and he moved and he done what the father
[1:28:58] had for him to do
[1:29:01] and so we said we see all these great
[1:29:03] things and and we see how people are
[1:29:05] standing there trying to figure that one
[1:29:06] out why how does that take place
[1:29:10] he said well we broke into eternity
[1:29:14] and we're standing there looking at that
[1:29:16] and they can't figure that out
[1:29:19] and brother sisters i want to share with
[1:29:21] you one thing tonight
[1:29:23] if that don't stir your soul your spoons
[1:29:24] fell out of your bowl
[1:29:28] i hope so i i may be the only person in
[1:29:30] the building that feels that way but i i
[1:29:31] do but
[1:29:33] why because you know that proves that
[1:29:35] proves god
[1:29:38] and here's the bride in christ as one
[1:29:41] when he said you see one you've seen the
[1:29:42] other in the book of revelation you
[1:29:45] don't see one without the other
[1:29:47] one
[1:29:48] and so here's one he's like here's the
[1:29:50] other and science is trying to figure
[1:29:52] out how did that work
[1:29:54] one because it's one
[1:29:56] it's god
[1:29:58] right as
[1:29:59] it works as one and he said don't you
[1:30:01] understand that when when you move
[1:30:04] and you and you walk and the things that
[1:30:06] you do and all the things that you do
[1:30:08] that's the that's expression of the
[1:30:11] attributes of god
[1:30:14] when you understand who you are
[1:30:17] what god's called you to you're not
[1:30:20] you're not just
[1:30:22] when you understand you know i'm i'm not
[1:30:24] i'm not the son
[1:30:26] of dale and diane roberts
[1:30:30] but i'm a son of god
[1:30:34] then i understand that you know where i
[1:30:36] come from
[1:30:37] and that's where i'm going
[1:30:40] then you know what what god has called
[1:30:42] me to is to see where i came from and
[1:30:45] then you know what i work in continuity
[1:30:47] with him i'm working complementary with
[1:30:49] him
[1:30:51] the word has come to me
[1:30:53] to make the word manifest
[1:30:56] all that god was he poured into christ
[1:30:58] all that christ was he poured into the
[1:31:00] believer
[1:31:03] then you know what you and i are that
[1:31:06] expressed attribute of jesus
[1:31:08] of god
[1:31:09] that's who you are
[1:31:12] and see the devil doesn't want you to
[1:31:14] know that
[1:31:16] but you know
[1:31:18] science is up there still trying to
[1:31:19] figure out
[1:31:20] all these things and
[1:31:25] but you know what
[1:31:26] he said in all their learning they
[1:31:28] become fools
[1:31:31] why because they can't understand
[1:31:33] brother brown said they walk over grass
[1:31:35] they don't understand how it comes they
[1:31:37] don't understand the life in the grass
[1:31:39] but they walk over it
[1:31:41] in all of their study and then they
[1:31:42] stand up and say there is no god
[1:31:47] in the in science proves and all the
[1:31:51] things that that we've seen it proves
[1:31:53] the existence of god it shows these
[1:31:54] things
[1:31:56] and he said he said the natural types of
[1:31:58] spiritual
[1:32:00] you know
[1:32:02] we may not understand everything but you
[1:32:03] know what
[1:32:04] god has called us to be the same thing
[1:32:07] you are a part of him
[1:32:09] to walk in complimentary to walk as he
[1:32:11] walks to move as he walks
[1:32:15] then when then when he says he says god
[1:32:17] has no hands but your hands
[1:32:20] and god has
[1:32:21] no
[1:32:22] mouth but your mouth
[1:32:24] he has no lips but your lips
[1:32:26] then to understand what god has called
[1:32:28] you and i too
[1:32:29] to realize who we are
[1:32:31] amen god bless you not let's all stay
[1:32:33] and have the musicians come
[1:32:35] [Applause]
[1:32:52] um
[1:32:54] do we know the song he's here

[1:34:09] he's here elijah's god is him
[1:34:14] she walks and step with a revealed word
[1:34:18] of the hour
[1:34:20] she talks and demons flee before his
[1:34:24] mighty power
[1:34:26] behold the bride of christ in fuller rey
[1:34:31] he's here elijah's god is here
[1:34:36] he's here elijah's god is in our hearts

[1:34:42] he's here to well and do whatever we say
[1:34:48] behold the bride of christ and full of
[1:34:52] rey he's here
[1:34:54] elijah's god is here
[1:34:58] [Applause]
[1:35:00] amen
[1:35:02] amen amen
[1:35:06] amen just like
[1:35:07] elijah
[1:35:09] elisha following elijah
[1:35:12] that mental fell upon elisha
[1:35:14] so where is the god of elijah
[1:35:18] he knew
[1:35:20] it was on him
[1:35:22] he come to him
[1:35:25] where where is the god of william
[1:35:28] branham he's here
[1:35:32] you know he's not somewhere else he
[1:35:33] didn't he didn't leave
[1:35:36] but he come to each one of us he's here
[1:35:40] i because the word came to me
[1:35:44] the prophet the prophet brought the word
[1:35:46] to me
[1:35:47] hates come to me
[1:35:52] i love that song
[1:35:53] she walks in step with the revealed word
[1:35:55] of the hour
[1:35:58] well sometimes it may not you may not
[1:36:00] feel like it
[1:36:01] you may not look like it but you know
[1:36:03] what you're moving in the word of god
[1:36:06] because that's thus saith the lord
[1:36:10] that's what god has said about you
[1:36:13] and to speak
[1:36:15] because he said to speak
[1:36:18] he said if you say unto this mountain so
[1:36:20] that's your
[1:36:22] he gave us the word to speak
[1:36:24] that's our commission
[1:36:27] and he'll do what we ask
[1:36:30] and when we understand that we are a
[1:36:32] part of him then you know what we're not
[1:36:34] we're not just speaking anything but you
[1:36:36] know we're speaking the word of god
[1:36:37] because we have the mind of christ
[1:36:40] amen well god bless you tonight well
[1:36:43] i have another song before we go about
[1:36:45] we'll bless your name amen amen
